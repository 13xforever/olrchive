0	27000	Today, I have just a few words about Masayuki Uemura. He helped design some of the most influential gaming systems I played, and we all know them behind the name Nintendo. I know little about him personally, I can only laud his work on what were incredibly influential systems, and that's all I want to do. Uemura-san, your contributions are invaluable.
28000	37000	My eulogy is done, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you the rest of tonight's news and their own thoughts. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37000	59000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice, and I'm one of those voices. Hi, I am Rob Roberts, and joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60000	74000	Hello, hello. We are here, joined together to discuss games for episode 895, December the 12th of 2021. Can you believe it, DarkSakura? We're just like three weeks away, I think, from our 20th year of broadcasting?
75000	80000	No, I believe it. I feel, I feel old, creaky.
80000	89000	Yeah, actually, yeah, with, with everything I've gone through medically the last year, it's like, I'm starting to feel a little old too. You know, I was, I was out walking yesterday.
89000	97000	I've talked previously on the show, Pikmin Bloom's been a great motivator for that, but I need to be walking anyway because of the things that I'm going through.
97000	108000	But as I'm walking, then like my leg is starting to hurt and cramp, and I'm like, ow, and I'm like, getting old sucks, damned if you do, damned if you don't. You need to walk, leg, don't walk.
108000	120000	Rob. What? Rob. What? Take magnesium. I try to take- Seriously. I think the vitamins I take have that in it, maybe? I don't know. No, take magnesium before you go to bed, trust me.
120000	125000	Okay. All right. I'll look into it. So you, and you did, you worked at a supplement store for a while.
125000	139000	Well, not just there, you know, I was a massage therapist and did the holistic medicine off and on. So, but, um, I, I was waking up in the middle of the night with leg cramps.
140000	143000	That doesn't happen to me anymore.
143000	148000	But, but magnesium helps with, with leg cramping and muscle soreness.
148000	153000	You know what does happen to me in the middle of the night though? Here's, I'm going to, I'm going to- And I'm not a doctor, so don't quote me.
153000	164000	No, that's fine. That's fine. It's, you know what, still, asking Jamie is better than asking WebMD, trust. Um, so here's, here's, diagnose this problem, Jamie. I'm curious about this.
164000	169000	So, you know, I like, I like to use the apps with my smartwatch. Oh, let me introduce tech master, Loki. Hi, Loki.
169000	170000	Hi.
170000	179000	If you want to diagnose this, you can too. And then I'll ask you about what you've got playing there. So, okay. So here's the thing. So I have like the smartwatch that measures my heart rate when I sleep. Right.
179000	192000	And that I stand so many hours and all that stuff. Right. Here's the thing. So I was looking at me sleeping yesterday and my little thing tells me I was up between 230 and like 245 and I was standing apparently.
192000	205000	I don't remember it. So is this like a, um, what's that, what's that scary movie where the, the, the camera watches the people sleep and they get up and do horrible things in the middle of the night? Is that, is that, am I possessed?
205000	206000	No.
206000	209000	Am I sleepwalking? I don't know.
209000	210000	I sleepwalk.
210000	212000	Do you?
212000	221000	Um, part of what I'm going through medically came from the fact that I used to sleepwalk a lot.
221000	230000	I'll just, I'll go ahead and just tell everybody I might've, I've mentioned some of it before, but I'm being tested for, for narcolepsy.
230000	240000	And one of the symptoms of untreated narcolepsy is sleepwalking and sometimes waking up eating.
240000	257000	Um, also, uh, sleep paralysis, night terrors. They go with it too. Um, talking in your sleep, but, uh, I, I, I, I wake up in the bathroom.
257000	267000	See that that's never happened to me. If that was happening to me, then I feel like I, I know the explanation a little better, but I've never, and Alan's never said I do anything. And I know Alan's up at all hours.
267000	268000	Do you sleep on your stomach?
268000	271000	Uh, no, no, more of my side than anything.
271000	278000	I was going to say, cause sometimes the standing can trigger if your arm is laying over the side of the bed.
278000	280000	Hmm.
280000	287000	Um, sometimes it can just be from general twitchiness and elevation and heart rate.
287000	289000	I guess it thinks you're doing something.
289000	299000	I guess so. And, uh, go into our chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby black will show.
299000	306000	And Jason is there, our voiceover man saying, you're not sleepwalking, Rob, you're just tossing and turning. And that's enough to register as a stand.
306000	311000	You would know if you were sleepwalking because someone would tell you, or as Jamie just said, you would wake up in a place you didn't go to sleep in.
311000	321000	But, and you know what? I would believe that because I do do this weird thing and I promise we're a video game show, but we're a three hour video game show.
321000	326000	So we talk about a lot. I do do this weird thing and Alan makes fun of me for it constantly.
326000	340000	We're like, I put, I don't know how to explain it. I like lie down in a way I put my legs up so that my knees are like way up in the air, even though my feet are on the bed, but like I'm bending my legs and I do this, I do it while I sleep like, and I don't realize I'm doing it.
340000	348000	So I'm not surprised. I'm probably contorting into all sorts of weird positions when I sleep. So, yeah, that could very well be it.
348000	364000	I mean, since I've been going off of my meds, I'm actually having, and I'm pretty sure that they're bouts of sleep paralysis that I'm just not remembering, but I wake up stiffer than usual because I used to sort of toss around a lot when I, when I'm medicated.
365000	383000	And now I, I wake up really, really stiff and sore. I mean, part of, part of withdrawing from SSI, we were talking about this before the show, I was trying to check some of my symptoms because I've been feeling just so funky in other ways apart from my mood coming off of my SSRIs.
383000	406000	This, my antidepressants is that I've been feeling like sick, like almost fluish. And I thought that was just from my chronic fatigue getting worse since I'm coming off my meds, but it's another symptom on there along with like extra muscle soreness and nausea.
407000	419000	And I have been really nauseous lately, so I'm coming off of like four different medications. So the fact that I am sitting up right now after as little sleep as I got last night, kind of a feat.
419000	422000	She's, she's here, here for y'all.
422000	423000	Caffeine sippy sippy.
424000	429000	Thank you, SJ 100. Matt, who says my girlfriend does that as well when she's sleeping the knee thing. Oh, good. I'm not alone.
429000	434000	She hold 10 and chat says get a bedroom webcam. No, I'm scared to watch that.
436000	440000	I'm scared to watch it. I won't do it. Sorry. I won't do it. I won't do that.
440000	443000	I used to fall asleep on my face with my butt sticking in the air.
444000	450000	But the thing is, I'd also watch TV like that when I was, of course, I've been nearsighted all my life and I didn't know.
450000	458000	So I would sit right in front of the TV with my ear to the ground and my butt in the air bent over because it was comfortable for some reason.
459000	465000	And pixel pockets and chat reminded me of the name of that movie. Thank you. Paranormal Activity. That was it.
465000	471000	That is why I won't film myself. She hope because I'm worried it's going to be that movie. And I just I'd rather be ignorant. Thank you very much.
472000	477000	Yeah, I've done an at home sleep study before for the record. I know a couple people have mentioned it.
478000	485000	That was testing me for sleep apnea, which I don't have. This is the one I'm doing is a full in lab overnight study.
486000	491000	And then I'm also doing a nap study. Yes, they are going to study me taking naps.
492000	498000	Or basically, I think I'm going to be taking like a 20 minute nap every two hours for an entire day.
499000	503000	So I'll be getting a lot of artwork done. All right.
504000	509000	Since I brought up movies, let me pivot back over to Loki. Well, we'll try to get back on the track of video games.
510000	514000	So I know we're going to talk about the game awards here in a minute, but obviously one of the big things that they revealed.
514000	519000	In fact, interesting. I think it was the last announcement, which was an interesting thing because we kind of knew it was coming.
519000	526000	The Unreal Engine 5 featuring the Matrix. So the Matrix experience in Unreal Engine 5 and live here at Twitch tonight.
527000	532000	I notice you are playing the demo. It looks like behind you there. I didn't get a chance to check it out.
533000	535000	I know you're a big Matrix fan. Did you? Did you look at it?
536000	541000	No, I didn't because my sister's still borrowing my Xbox Series X, so I didn't get to play it.
542000	546000	I watched videos of it, though. OK, how is it? I haven't even watched it. It looks really nice.
546000	549000	Yeah, Bobby was talking a little bit about it on his show. It looks it looks very interesting.
550000	555000	It looks like it's a lot of elements of the very first movie, but like it's not a movie. It's actually done in Unreal Engine.
556000	559000	So kind of the future, what games will look like. And I'm sure they're trying to push that.
560000	563000	And they're, of course, that new Matrix movie coming out. They're pushing that, too, and the awareness.
564000	569000	Well, I'd hope that they're making a new Matrix game because it looks cool. I'd be down for a new Matrix game.
569000	579000	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they didn't announce a new Matrix game because that one that they did around the time of the sequel and the third part of the trilogy,
580000	586000	The Matrix Returns and The Revolutions, like back when those were out, I remember they made a really big deal about the what it was.
587000	595000	It would have been like GameCube, PlayStation 2, because they actually had like Jada Pinkett and one of the other actors in the movie were the stars of the game.
595000	602000	It was a whole that was that was enter the Matrix. And the thing with that is that the game was actually part of the storyline, too.
603000	610000	So there was like stuff that in the movie you'd see these characters like walk off screen and then the game would kind of take over from that.
611000	615000	Yeah. So you got to follow those characters and see what they were doing the whole time.
616000	623000	Kind of neat. All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and talk a little bit about the game awards that happened this week.
623000	630000	Because, of course, that happened on Thursday and we talked a lot about this last week that we anticipated there were going to be a lot of announcements.
631000	639000	And I think as we know, the game awards are there. They're like awards in lowercase and then in uppercase trailers and commercials.
640000	647000	So the awards are a little bit more of a footnote to this whole thing. But we got a heck of a lot of announcements out of this thing.
648000	655000	Dark Soccer, I couldn't help but think of you when I saw that Sonic Frontiers, because I know you've been a Sega gal for a long time.
656000	662000	What did you think of that whole Sonic Frontiers or excuse me, Sonic Breath of the Wild, as many are calling it? What did you think about that?
663000	673000	It looks neat. Something worth a try. I get and this is always what makes me think of anything like part of the scenery for some reason made me think of in Sonic Adventure.
673000	683000	When you go to see Tikal's temple and it looks like it's way out in the distance, even though it's just sort of like there's just like a little bit of jungle to go through.
684000	695000	And that's kind of what that made me think of. And I remember just that feeling of, oh, gosh, this is pretty big. I mean, in the Dreamcast back in the day, it was pretty big.
696000	698000	So I had kind of that feeling again.
699000	707000	That also reminds me that they showed that new movie trailer for Sonic 2, which brings me to one of my issues with the Game Awards.
708000	713000	Oh, you should. It's actually and my issue hasn't even seen the first one, though. My issue has nothing to do with the trailer.
714000	720000	The trailer looked cute. It looks like a cute like especially like a family movie. I was like, oh, Loki's looking. The kids are going to have a fun date night.
720000	725000	I don't know what else called family date night at the Sonic 2 movie. It looks it looks nice.
726000	732000	But here's here's one of my issues with the Game Awards is they hype this appearance by Jim Carrey. Right.
733000	739000	Well, Jim Carrey was there via video in a pre tape thing. And they always and I'm sorry, guys, it looks it looks really bad.
740000	746000	And stage is they try to make it look like, oh, I'm going to talk to him by saying this line that was written on the teleprompter.
746000	751000	Duh, duh, duh. And then he picks up in the prerecorded video where the dialogue left off.
752000	757000	This happened with Keanu Reeves speaking of The Matrix saying later on, too, like they tried to do that live illusion.
758000	764000	But if you really like listen to it and really try to like what you can tell, this is a video trick they do all the time.
765000	769000	So I thought that was kind of lame that they advertise an appearance by Jim Carrey and then he wasn't even really there.
769000	776000	He was just in a video message, which I guess was funny. It was funnier than the other guy. Sorry, all TL shade.
777000	783000	But Loki, I know you're a Jim Carrey fan. What did you are you are you OK with with him not showing up for real real?
784000	787000	I don't care. He doesn't need to be there.
788000	789000	He doesn't need to be there.
790000	795000	No, I wasn't even expecting him to make an appearance. I just want to see a trailer of the movie.
795000	802000	It's fair. Cool. They got a video of him. All right. That's nice. It had nothing to do with the movie. I mean, for the most part.
803000	812000	Tiger Claw in chat says Sonic the Hedgehog 2 looks way better than the first movie. And I know Tiger Claw loves the Sonic universe, so I know he's hyped for it because of Knuckles.
813000	824000	I've watched tons of reaction videos and they all went nuts over Knuckles. Yeah, I think I think one of the best memes I saw about the whole thing was like Idris Elba talking about I'm not making Knuckles sing.
825000	832000	It's sexy. Knuckles is not a sexy character intended to be sexy. And then the trailer shows up and everybody's like, so sexy.
833000	840000	Right. It's like if you're Idris Elba, you have you have to really, really try and not be sexy. That's the problem.
841000	849000	I love Knuckles anyway. Exactly. Exactly. So it's kind of funny. Let's talk about some of the other things that showed up at the Game Awards.
849000	858000	Hey, I was excited about this. Alan Wake 2. It's real. It's happening. I suppose the remaster should have been a clue that this was probably getting revived.
859000	872000	Some folks thought that didn't the American Nightmare count as Alan Wake Part 2? No, that was that wasn't that weird period of Xbox 360 DLC when like DLC was released as like standalone experiences.
872000	881000	It was weird. There was a few games like that. But anyway, there's an actual Alan Wake 2 coming. It looks scarier. And that's because they're saying this is a survival horror game.
882000	888000	And he talks a little bit about how the first one was more of an action game. So it is kind of a genre shift for Alan Wake. So that'll be interesting.
889000	895000	I was not too scared. Excuse me. I'm getting the hiccups scared into me. I'm hoping it's not too scary.
895000	903000	Are those supposed to work the other way around? I know, right? No, but I dare to be different. But I'm excited about Alan Wake 2. I don't know about you guys, but I think it'll look like looks like fun.
904000	914000	They showed a teaser for a new Wonder Woman game. And my reaction. And by the way, we did do a live broadcast. At least Bobby Blackwell, myself kind of teamed up to do a little reaction stream.
914000	925000	And it is in the archives over at VOG Network on Twitch for subscribers. Not that I expect you to watch the whole thing again, but maybe. But we had a lot of fun. We had a decent turnout for Thursday night. I was really, really happy with that.
926000	934000	And when they revealed this, Wonder Woman is getting her own game. It was one of those things where I was like, damn, how did she not have her own game?
935000	943000	This is definitely one of those things you kind of think about and go, well, this makes a lot of sense. Of course, this should be a thing. How did no one predict that this would happen?
944000	953000	I believe this was also from Rocksteady, who did those Batman games like Arkham City and all that stuff. The stuff that was like really well done.
954000	960000	Yeah. And so they're making the Wonder Woman game now. So I fully expect the Wonder Woman game is going to kick ass too. No pressure.
961000	964000	Hey, Rob. Do you want to know something offhand? What was that?
965000	966000	Arkham City could be a classic game.
966000	972000	Oh, Jesus. Can it? Well, the Arkham City or just the first one, the Arkham Asylum.
973000	982000	Arkham City. Oh, Jesus. Wow. Well, hopefully they'll apply some of the good stuff in Wonder Woman because no pressure.
983000	987000	You know, it's Rocksteady and it's only like DC's probably best movie franchise right now.
988000	991000	You mean they're only good movie franchises right now.
991000	999000	And I saw that trailer for Batman and I don't know. Did you see that trailer for the new Batman? I don't know.
1000000	1008000	Am I going to watch anything Batman? No, I would rather watch good movies. There hasn't been a good Batman movie since Keaton.
1009000	1015000	Yeah. It was a really bold decision of them to make Batman a vampire this time, but you know.
1015000	1018000	I like the Nolan trilogy, but that's a different discussion.
1019000	1027000	Star Wars Eclipse is a new game. It's coming from Quantic Dream and it looks to be, you know, we heard the rumors about this one.
1028000	1032000	It better control better. It better be a lot more actionable than Detroit and the other games.
1033000	1038000	Yeah. Don't get me wrong. I love Detroit, but way too command heavy.
1039000	1041000	The trailer looked really good though. I got to say that.
1042000	1043000	I expect good things from Quantic.
1043000	1050000	Some people taking issue with Quantic Dream because of, you know, this awakening we're having in gaming culture.
1051000	1054000	That there's a lot of bullshit going on and a lot of that bullshit tied to Quantic Dream.
1055000	1062000	So that's been a sticking point for a lot of people, especially when Geoff Keighley made that, you know, very heartfelt message at the beginning of the game awards.
1063000	1065000	And then it was like, oh, here's a trailer for a new Quantic Dream game.
1065000	1073000	I saw that tweet several times on my Twitter feed. A lot of people making that joke, even when it's really not a joke.
1074000	1077000	But I guess that observation, I suppose.
1078000	1088000	Hopefully the issues at the studio can be worked out. The game itself does look really good, but we'll see when the gameplay shows up.
1089000	1093000	Because you know I'm always about, I want to see the gameplay. I don't get excited by the CGI trailers as much anymore.
1093000	1101000	But it definitely shows a certain tone to the game that I don't think we've seen in a Star Wars game that I can recall.
1102000	1103000	A Dune tone?
1104000	1105000	Maybe.
1106000	1111000	Elden Ring showed up again. Sorry, they are hyping this way too much for me.
1112000	1115000	This is a Deathloop. I guess Deathloop turned out pretty good.
1116000	1119000	And No Man's Sky, which No Man's Sky wasn't great when it released, now it's really good.
1119000	1125000	But you know what I'm talking about, those games where they just hype and hype and hype, and Elden Ring is getting to that for me.
1126000	1131000	Literally, when they were doing that whole little interaction on the stage with the pot, I was just like, shut up.
1132000	1137000	Shut up. Just show the trailer. I don't care. Get on with it.
1138000	1145000	Anyway, sorry. I see George R.R. Martin. I know he's involved with it. That's what makes a lot of people excited.
1145000	1151000	And I still think, are you ever going to finish the next book? Are you ever going to finish the next book?
1152000	1153000	No.
1154000	1155000	We all know.
1156000	1157000	Let's see.
1158000	1166000	SSJ100Matt, going back to the Jeff statement in chat, a lot of folks felt Jeff was soft with his statement, but I think he did the best he could.
1167000	1169000	At least he didn't ignore it. I also agree he did the best he could.
1169000	1179000	And I think if you expected him to get up there and say, yo, fuck Activision and Bobby Kotick and Ubisoft too, I think that's a little bit unrealistic.
1180000	1192000	Considering that, and I know it sucks, I'm not saying it's not a shitty situation, but a lot of these trailers and the commercial and the money that goes into it is coming from a lot of these companies.
1192000	1200000	So I feel like he did what he had to do without naming names and get that applause and support that he could.
1201000	1211000	We'll get into it later in the show, but these companies are doing enough damage themselves that change is going to come because it really looks like it's coming at one of our biggest scenarios.
1212000	1217000	And we'll get into that later in the show. I know we have a topic on it later, but I think that's kind of important to point out.
1218000	1227000	They announced Among Us coming to VR, which I'm kind of like a little late for me. I don't know if this is something I'm into, but cute.
1228000	1240000	Dune is coming back to video games. It's a 4X game and there was a Dune game several years ago, certainly enough to be a classic game of the week.
1241000	1243000	So it is interesting. They're kind of going back to that with the movie.
1243000	1253000	The Suicide Squad killed the Justice League had a whole little splash and stuff with it. Deborah Wilson got on stage as Amanda.
1254000	1257000	What's her name? Amanda Waller.
1258000	1261000	Thank you, Waller. Sorry, I don't follow the comic stuff as much as others.
1262000	1263000	You gotta watch the movie. It's really good.
1264000	1267000	I only saw the first one, which honestly I liked.
1268000	1270000	The second one is even better. It is so much better.
1270000	1273000	One of these days I'll binge it. I'm really behind on comic book movies.
1274000	1278000	Anyway, Deborah Wilson was up on stage. I remember her from Mad TV. She's fantastic.
1279000	1285000	I was like, did she play Amanda in the movie? I didn't think she played, but I know they changed half the cast for the second movie.
1286000	1290000	So I was like, maybe they changed that too. But no, she's just the game version of Amanda Waller, I guess.
1291000	1295000	It was fun to see her on stage. I don't think there were very few people in that audience who knew who she was.
1295000	1300000	I would have been like, woo! But, oh well. I didn't get to go.
1301000	1305000	I loved you as Whitney. Or Oprah.
1306000	1316000	Hellblade 2 got a new cinematic gameplay look. I gotta say, that was a really cool extended play of that.
1317000	1324000	They do a lot of neat things with the sound design and literally the voices in her head. It's pretty fantastic.
1325000	1329000	Like I said, I don't know if I could play it. It looks too intense for me.
1330000	1334000	But I might watch somebody else play it when I can look away once in a while. That would be nice.
1335000	1337000	So, yeah. That was another thing they announced.
1338000	1344000	There was a brand new television spot for the Halo TV series. It was pretty short.
1345000	1351000	But they showed it and reinforced that it's coming to Paramount Plus at some point in 2022.
1351000	1354000	What did y'all think of that? Those that saw it. I thought it was...
1355000	1356000	Again, Paramount Plus.
1357000	1361000	I actually have Paramount Plus and I actually think it's a fine streaming service.
1362000	1364000	I use it more than I use Hulu, to be quite honest.
1365000	1366000	So, I don't know.
1369000	1371000	There was a lot of other announcements as well. I'm trying to think.
1372000	1376000	Oh, this one I definitely want to pick up on. The announcement of Slitterhead.
1376000	1382000	This is from the creator of Silent Hill with music by Akira Yamaoka.
1383000	1387000	So, it's not Silent Hill, Wink, but it's, you know, here we go again.
1388000	1393000	Old Konami veterans moving on from that wreck to create their own new thing out of the ashes.
1394000	1396000	Didn't they also do, what was it, Shadows of the Damned?
1397000	1402000	Was that them? Oh, I know Akira Yamaoka, I think, was involved with that, but I didn't know.
1402000	1406000	Yeah, he did the music for that, but I thought it was the same. I'll have to look it up again.
1407000	1410000	But, yeah, the trailer looked pretty intense.
1411000	1418000	And it's funny that everything was on the backdrop of Silent, because when that first came up on the screen about the creator of Silent Hill,
1419000	1424000	I started to go, because, you know, I thought maybe those rumors about a new Silent Hill were true and then, nah, it's a different thing.
1425000	1426000	But it's still pretty cool. I'm not going to lie.
1426000	1433000	But, yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking, Logi. Guillermo del Toro, introducing his movie, and before he introduces his movie, he goes,
1434000	1439000	You know what game had great art direction? Silent Hill. Man, I'd love to see another one of those someday.
1440000	1443000	And then just moves on, plugging his thing, and I'm just like, you motherfucker.
1444000	1449000	Like, I think you saw, you probably saw me on the, the, the speed. I'm like, you motherfucker.
1450000	1454000	What are you, you fucking troll. What are you doing, asshole?
1455000	1461000	Do you, do you think he, what do you, do you think there's something there, or do you think he is literally just being an asshole?
1462000	1466000	Okay, so Toyama didn't work on that game. He worked on Gravity Rush.
1467000	1469000	Oh, yeah. Interesting.
1472000	1480000	Dartatia, Dartatia in chat says, I'm curious to see how Slitterhead turns out. Definitely could be the same kind of vibe. Yeah.
1481000	1482000	I am all about this.
1482000	1484000	Yes. Oh, Slitterhead?
1485000	1486000	Yeah, I'm all about it.
1487000	1494000	Definitely up your alley. Definitely thought of you with that. Um, a lot of other stuff too. Uh, new DLC for Cuphead coming on June 30th.
1495000	1501000	That's, that's a ways out for some DLC, but it kind of looks like a whole new game, really, in a way. So, uh, there is that.
1502000	1509000	Uh, for Spoken, got a release date. It's coming out on May 24th. Oh, Loki, Saints Row. We got, we got a new trailer for that.
1509000	1514000	And I'm curious your thoughts, because you weren't, you weren't feeling it the first time, but how about this time?
1515000	1522000	I'm still, it's still okay. I don't know. I don't like the, the characters that they have in it. I mean, the gameplay looks okay, but I don't know.
1523000	1529000	I'm still not convinced of new characters yet. They have to show me, like, that I'd be interested in these characters.
1530000	1531000	All right.
1531000	1536000	Like, there'd have to be a dramatic shift in, in their personalities pretty quickly in the game.
1536000	1540000	There were some funny parts. I'm looking forward to this game getting discounted six months after its release.
1541000	1546000	Uh, and then I'll finally probably get around, or being free on the Epic Games Store after about a year. I'll probably pick it up.
1547000	1548000	Game pass.
1548000	1554000	Or game pass, yeah. We'll see. Um, unless, but if the reviews are really, really good, I might change my mind.
1555000	1560000	Uh, I was really excited about this. Uh, the Telltale game format making a comeback in two different ways.
1561000	1570000	There is a new game called Star Trek Resurgence. It is a Star Trek game from a new studio that's made up of a lot of the developers that used to be with Telltale Games.
1571000	1579000	Uh, and that looked really good. It's an original story, so it doesn't have any of the characters, uh, that you might know except Spock Prime was in it.
1580000	1585000	Uh, complete with Leonard Nimoy's likeness, so a pretty impressive feat that they got his likeness.
1585000	1592000	His voice is in it, well, I don't know if it's his voice, an impersonator, because, I mean, he could have recorded the lines years ago, we don't know.
1592000	1593000	Could be a son.
1593000	1601000	It could be, it could be a lot of things. Um, but, you know, definitely invoking Leonard Nimoy with the trailer, which makes a lot of Star Trek fans a little verklempt.
1602000	1610000	Which, um, was me as well, so, but I'm, I'm into it. That's, I think the Telltale format, uh, is gonna be great for a Star Trek game.
1611000	1618000	If Star Trek isn't up your alley and you enjoy other types of sci-fi, well, how about the one that the actual Telltale Games is doing?
1619000	1628000	As in, the ones who bought Telltale's name after Telltale went under in, what was it, 2017, 2018, and I think other folks from Telltale are at new Telltale.
1629000	1641000	Uh, they are making a game based on The Expanse, um, from the, uh, Amazon, uh, that sci-fi series, and I, I don't know as much about that one, except I love, uh, Chidori Ajgalu.
1641000	1646000	I, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that name, but I don't have it in front of me right now, and she's great, and I know she's in that.
1646000	1654000	Um, and, uh, I wonder if she's involved with the game, because that would be amazing. Um, so The Expanse. Um, that is coming as well.
1655000	1667000	Um, let's see, there's a lot, there was a lot of announcements. That all being said, uh, with the announcements, it still felt to me like a little bit lighter of a year than I think the past couple years.
1667000	1680000	Especially with the whole pomp and circumstance of, it's a return to person, and so forth. Um, I don't know, the announcements felt a little less big than they did in other years.
1680000	1689000	I don't know. Um, Loki, what did you think about the announcements overall? And if there's anything else you want to call out, um, please, by all means, I, I didn't get to everything, but there's a lot.
1689000	1708000	Um, I mean, it was, I don't know, it was alright. I, I didn't really think it was, there wasn't anything like, oh my god, this is so amazing. Um, yeah, I don't, I don't really think there was anything that really, like, made my jaw drop, but there was a lot of cool announcements.
1709000	1716000	Yeah, and SSJ100Matt in chat points out there's no huge AAA surprise, and I think that's what folks were looking for.
1716000	1724000	I think back to that year that they announced No Man's Sky. Like, that was just like, whoa, what is this? You know, like, there wasn't really anything like that.
1724000	1734000	Or that in a lot of years, you usually have, um, like a big Nintendo announcement. Like, remember the year that they, they, I think it was like the first gameplay of Breath of the Wild or something that was there.
1734000	1743000	And Nintendo was really kind of, they were there, and they accepted an award because Metroid Dread won, what, like, best action game.
1743000	1750000	And it was a little awkward because Doug Bowser accepted the award, which is fine, I understand. He's the president in America, but it's like, he didn't work on the game.
1750000	1759000	Um, but he did kind of, like, the nice thing was, like, about halfway through his speech, then he was like, I have a message from the development studios. I was like, oh, okay, okay.
1759000	1767000	Um, but, uh, other than that, Nintendo didn't really have much involvement. Remember, Reggie Fils-Aime has nothing to do with Nintendo anymore.
1767000	1777000	So even though he presented an award, uh, and was Reggie, it's, it is nice to have that, you know, little bit of Reggie every, every, every year at the Game Awards.
1777000	1786000	So there is that. Um, Dark Tetsuya says, uh, yeah, I was half expecting something from Nintendo, but I wasn't going to count on it. Sometimes they just don't have anything to show.
1786000	1796000	DJ Rama F says, shout out to Ninjasista from Black Compat. She was spotted on screen in the audience for five seconds. Okay, I thought that was her.
1796000	1802000	I didn't say anything on the live stream because I wasn't sure because I didn't know she was going. I mean, I guess I could read Facebook more often.
1802000	1813000	I didn't know she was going and everybody had their masks on in the audience. So I had that moment of, was that? But I didn't want to say it because I was like, well, if I'm wrong, that's going to be very embarrassing, you know,
1813000	1824000	because when you have your masks on, you can't like totally tell, even though her hair color, uh, as it is right now, should have been unique enough for me to recognize. I just, I hadn't seen the, um, turquoise hair, uh, in a minute.
1824000	1834000	So yeah, DJ Rama S says, I got the screenshot and I saw her outfit on Facebook. See, I never saw the Facebook post that she was going. Otherwise I would have, I would have seen that. Oh, oh, oh, that's, that's her.
1834000	1843000	So, uh, Bobby Lockwell says she's an Xbox MVP. So she was there on behalf of Xbox. Hey, I think that's great that Xbox invites their MVPs. I did see Phil Spencer in the audience.
1843000	1851000	So she, she must've been only a stone's throw away from Phil Spencer. So that's pretty cool. Um, oh yeah, this is funny too.
1851000	1860000	Thank you SSG100Matt for reminding me about this, that hilarious. Oh, and shout out for Black and Pat. Please drop them a follow here on Twitch if you aren't already.
1860000	1870000	Um, oh, oh, oh, that hilarious Bethesda commercial that played where they gave away game codes and said they had nothing to show because they were too busy making more ports of Skyrim.
1870000	1886000	I will say this for it's as much shit as the commercials get that Bethesda one in particular was pretty fucking good. Like not just the fact that it was very like parody and self-aware and they were scrolling those codes so fast on the screen.
1886000	1897000	And they did it to get the PC game pass. So that Xbox game pass rebranding is PC game pass. They did that where they flashed a bunch of codes and I tried to redeem one on air, but I was too slow. I didn't get it.
1897000	1912000	Uh, of course, of course I didn't. People are crazy fast. Um, but I thought it was interesting that it was a Bethesda jobs ad because they weren't promoting Starfield or Elder Scrolls 6 or even Deathloop.
1912000	1925000	They were promoting working there, which is very interesting when you consider Jeff's opening message and everything else going on in the industry right now. I thought that was interesting. Loki, any thoughts on that ad?
1925000	1944000	Um, no, I don't. I mean, a lot of these different companies have different issues. Um, I don't know, but does it now under the Microsoft umbrella? I don't think as bad of them anymore, but like, I mean, I don't know. Get your foot in the door, I guess.
1944000	1960000	Um, any, any parting thoughts, like, you know, before we get to our gaming weeks, um, Loki, if you were Jeff Keeley and running the game awards, what might you change for next year? What change might you make for, um, 2022 show?
1960000	1966000	And I'll open this up to Chad too, over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1966000	1970000	I could do without like a lot of the musical performances, to be honest.
1970000	1972000	You weren't, you weren't a fan of Sting?
1972000	1994000	Eh, Sting's all right. I like, I'd like me some desert Rose, but like, uh, no, like, I don't know. It's just, it takes up time, I think. And then also like some of the categories they just don't care about. I know other people care about it, but like, you know, content creator of the year.
1994000	2008000	Like you're talking, you're like picking out of like five, like four people or whatever. Like, no, no, thank you. Um, and then e-sports stuff. People like e-sports, but like, that's not for me.
2008000	2022000	I, and see, I'm going to take the hot take and some are going to be very mad at me for saying it. I think they should get rid of all those categories. I think they should get rid of the e-sports categories. They should get rid of that because a, they, they go through it in a wink and a flash on the show.
2022000	2038000	B, they don't acknowledge e-sports anywhere else on the show. So it, on, it really feels like a fucking fish tossed out. Like, you know, like, oh, hey, e-sports, what up? Okay. Anyway, moving on. Like, that's, it doesn't, it feels really disjointed.
2038000	2055000	Um, when, you know, and I say this as a content creator who will never get recognized at the game awards. I just think it's just one of those things where I think they could use the time somewhere else, especially when they, um, they, they don't do anything with it otherwise.
2055000	2067000	They had those nice, they have those nice commercials that spotlight certain creators. Like they had the one in the beginning with the drag queens. They had the, you know, the, the new class, they spotlighted a few of those shout out to DJ night.
2067000	2082000	Uh, if you still listen to our, uh, and all this stuff, but, um, I, I just, those were nice, but, um, I just feel like for the most part, the shows don't really focus on that. And it's a weird disjointing thing to be awesome.
2082000	2098000	To be honest. Um, also, um, I will say, uh, Loki, I do, I disagree a little bit on the musical performances. Uh, I thought they were all fine. I actually like the tradition of having the orchestra play the nominees of the year. I thought, I think that's actually something I look forward to.
2099000	2112000	I guess that's a little bit like the Oscars, I guess, but like, I don't know. I liked at least interesting thing for me. Like, it's not that it's bad. It's just like, this is the lowest of interest I have in this part of the show.
2112000	2128000	I thought, I think you might be addressing the imagined dragon, super giant games thing, which was, and I thought that was just, it was the wrong year for that. I liked the collaboration and I liked the music, the super giant games makes, but their big year was last year and they had nothing to announce this year.
2128000	2140000	So it seemed a little out of place where it was like, Hey, we're going to jam to Bastion. It was just like, it just seemed a little out of place. Uh, and that was my only issue with it, a sting in that song. I mean, Arkane is blown up right now.
2140000	2152000	And I've heard nothing but great things about that show, no matter how you feel about legal legends. So I get that one as well. But then again, sometimes like the, what are these awards for games or media based on games?
2152000	2165000	I think that's another, a good question to ask as well. Um, yeah. Uh, as soon as Matt says, I'm fine with having it in the pre-show because it's kind of like a technical awards, like what the Oscars do the night before.
2165000	2181000	I think it's actually about a week or two before, but I think you're onto something. I think there should be a more technical award focused thing. Like that pre-show should be spun off into its own, like maybe the game awards content creators or, or, um, the players or something.
2181000	2186000	They did some of that. They did do like some awards during the pre-show, if I remember correctly.
2186000	2190000	That's where they blow through a lot of them.
2190000	2196000	So like, it's not really a pre-show. It's just, it's weird. Um, my thing is that.
2196000	2198000	They need their own daytime Emmys, Rob.
2198000	2212000	Yeah, they do. Uh, my thing is that I think they need to, I think the audience is getting smarter and really figuring out that like, they're not mentioning that there are commercials.
2212000	2220000	Um, and they're trying to pass off commercials as like trailers because of the way Jeff kind of will say, oh, and he'll kind of like talk about it.
2220000	2229000	I think they should maybe look at doing something a little more traditional that, you know, when they, they pan out and say, and coming up after the break, we have performances by Imagine Dragons.
2229000	2235000	And then when they come back from the break, it has like a, like, it should maybe look a little more like traditional TV in that regard.
2235000	2240000	Um, I understand the show doesn't pay for itself and Jeff has to make the money somehow.
2240000	2248000	Um, I just think the audience is starting to outsmart him a little bit and they're kind of seeing it for what it is.
2248000	2255000	Uh, and that is, you know, paid, uh, spots. So I, I kind of think, yeah.
2255000	2264000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, their thing with the content creator award is that they want it to be something anyone believes that they can win.
2264000	2272000	But no one believes that they can win that for what it's worth. I am well aware I will never win it. And I'm at peace with that. You know why?
2272000	2288000	Cause I got y'all in chat tonight. And even if, even if we aren't the number and those, you listen on the podcast feed well, even if we aren't the number one network on Twitch, the fact that even somebody listens to this, uh, who isn't directly a relative of mine or my co-host is pretty fucking awesome.
2288000	2298000	So, oh, am I supposed to be listening to this? No, no, you listen to it live. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2298000	2308000	Let's give the kids something to listen to and talk about the types of video games we have been playing this week. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? You're muted. Just so you know.
2309000	2322000	I played dead by daylight and lots of it and lots of it played pinball. We, um, we finally got the animatronic of, uh, Grogu installed in the Mandalorian.
2322000	2333000	Oh, so we have, uh, Dan's buddy came up with that mod. So it's like using the little toy from target, you know, they were selling the animatronic toy.
2333000	2348000	And it fits perfectly in the table and that's what all wired up. So when you're in that particular mode, it blinks and moves its little ears and does stupid child things.
2348000	2360000	Cute. And if I thought the character was interesting or anything, I would be more excited about it, but Dan's really excited about it and it looks really cool. And it's a thing that his friend came up with. So.
2361000	2370000	Cool. Cool. Um, I have a quick dead by daylight story for you that may crack you up. What did Debbie do this time? Cause I went up against a pig today.
2370000	2383000	It was my, it was my first match since I changed my name to Enya on steam because I just, I, you know, I, yeah, because I see, I see all these people like Cardi B or hex Britney Spears.
2383000	2394000	I changed my name to Enya and I changed my profile picture on steam to a picture of Enya as well. So some of you that have me on steam are like, who the fuck is Enya? It's me.
2394000	2405000	And it's just a funny dead by daylight joke because I've been into playing the artists lately. So I think that's kind of funny. And, uh, I I've been leveling Michaela who, and I also think that's, I think Enya kind of fits those. Yeah.
2405000	2412000	Yeah. Barista witch. So, so my first match is Enya. I go up against a pig and, um, somebody did.
2412000	2413000	Did you think it was me?
2413000	2424000	No, I didn't think it was you, but somebody, cause this, you know, my pig, this person, this person, this person was not great. And you've had a lot of practices pig. Um, but, uh,
2424000	2427000	Like the, the typical tunneling pig?
2428000	2441000	No, they just, they were really bad at chasing really bad. Okay. Um, so, um, everybody's got to start somewhere. I, you know, but here's the thing, somebody disconnected right at the start of the match because clearly they saw it was a pig.
2441000	2452000	And so they disconnected and I'm like, eh, I can't, I can't really blame that. But like at the same time, I want out of this match, I want out of this match because I don't like to play after somebody DCs.
2452000	2463000	I'm like, we're screwed. It's three versus one now. So, but I didn't want to just DC myself because I had a thing to empty toolboxes. So like, of course pig finds me, chases me, hooks me, bam, bam.
2463000	2472000	I try to use my, uh, YOLO off the hook. Doesn't work. I go to second stage. I'm like, okay, I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to kill myself. And I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to say that on stream.
2472000	2475000	I'm going to un-alive. Okay. And do all that. And then.
2475000	2478000	You're going to, you're going to let, you're going to let Nia take you.
2478000	2489000	Yeah. Yes. I'm going to let Nia take me. So then, um, I'm talking about a video game. I think we all know that. So then somebody, uh, of course at the last second, unhooks me and I'm like, son of a bitch.
2489000	2497000	So I just, and then the pig started chasing the pig. No, well, the pig started chasing her for unhooking me. And I'm like, no, fuck you. Take me, take me.
2498000	2507000	And so pig takes me down and leaves me for minutes and minutes and minutes. And so I was like, oh fine, fuck this. So finally I get picked up.
2507000	2513000	So you just got plugged in left behind? Yes. Well, no, some, finally somebody picks me up. So I was like, fine, I'll play the game.
2513000	2526000	We do gens and there's a snowman by the gate. Somebody gets hooked and I'm like, eh, fuck it. I hop in the snowman and hop out the gate and I got my frosty ice for trickster.
2526000	2538000	Cool. I need to just start hitting snowmen. And I'm thinking about doing the bitchy thing and taking doctor into a match. Oh, anyway, I was so everyone will hate me and I don't care.
2538000	2549000	I'm a Grinch. Bah, fucking humbug. All right. There's my dead by daylight story. I thought Jamie would enjoy cause it's a pig story and how I just said, cause pig is the best. Screw these survivors.
2549000	2558000	Pig is the best. Like I actually was hanging out and to give my, one of my streamer shout outs for this episode is the pig.
2558000	2569000	Oh, I've seen that one around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it was my pig who best do gotcha. So, um, no, I knew, I knew it wasn't you cause I didn't get sent to RPD.
2569000	2584000	I don't, I don't have any RPD offerings. Okay. All right. And the funny thing is now is that like ever since I did the old version of that build, right? It's now a thing that people do. People are calling it resident pig.
2584000	2594000	Oh, that's cute. I've apparently started something and no one knows I did it except for like a couple of people story of our lives here at orange launch radio. You should be used to this by now.
2594000	2607000	Well, yeah, but, um, I have decided on something. Um, I've decided that my mental breakdown is going to be televised. I will be streaming every day during my medical leave except for the day I'm doing my sleep lab.
2607000	2609000	All right.
2609000	2614000	If you want to see me lose my shit at people, watch me stream.
2614000	2625000	Well, if you see Enya, give her hatch. All right. Oh, I was going to say, I was going to say, I thought of the best name and I can't switch my names or I would do it since I'm on stadia, but you should do this sometime. Rob, do it for me. Okay. What's that?
2625000	2629000	It should be hex N.
2629000	2643000	Oh, it took me a minute. Took me a minute. Oh, that's clever. Okay. I get it. I get it. Hex are like hex and then beyond heretic or something. See, he gets it. I like that. Someone had maximum overdrive last night and I was like, it's the eighties.
2643000	2651000	All right. I laughed so hard at that one. It's like that movie was terrible. You were there. I think. I think so. Um, it was an LC stream.
2652000	2665000	Loki, let me go. Yeah. Uh, bonds double six and chat says Epic game store gave away dbd for a week. Oh yeah. We know you can tell. Well, yeah, we know. And you can tell in the game. How do you know? Uh, cause there's a lot of babies in the game right now, which is fine.
2665000	2679000	Hooray. New players playing a game. I really enjoy that. Thank you for boosting my MMR, which I don't want it boosted any more than it is. It is noticeable. That's all I'm going to say. Well, you know how MMR works when you're a killer, right?
2679000	2689000	Yes. I considered a one V four it's for one V one matches. And that's why killer MMR shoots up when you get four Ks.
2689000	2695000	Boy. Oh boy. All right. Terrible. We got to get to other games though. So let's go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2696000	2717000	It's all Minecraft again. Um, so we started season two of nerd craft finally, cause I decided to host the server and, um, it's because, uh, the guy that runs it maxi-man is in an area where they've been hit with like some massive flooding and that
2718000	2720000	the tornado is back, back in the Southeast.
2720000	2737000	Well, he's in Canada, so it was like way before all this, this is like last the end of the last month. Um, so they had a bunch of flooding that's knocked out, like a lot of the postal stuff there, but there's like a package that it's just out there floating in the limbo, um, with the server Ram.
2737000	2755000	So I was like, well, it's just, I'll host the server. We can just do like a third party hosts and just do that. So we did that. And I've been just stressed out trying to get everything working. So, so we launched today and it's been a little buggy, a little laggy for some people.
2755000	2770000	I kind of feel bad because the guy's supposed to be playing with couldn't connect today. Um, it's out of my control. I can't really make it less laggy for them. Uh, it's my connection has been fine. So he's closer to the server than I am too. So I don't know.
2771000	2783000	But speaking of those tornadoes are real quick, just, you know, obviously I don't think any of our listeners were impacted by that. The only, the only person I know in Kentucky is a pod culture who I also see in chats in those tornadoes.
2783000	2795000	Just miss my city. Thank gosh. Um, but I have a lot of friends in those areas. Oh, cause yeah, you growing up in Alabama, you probably know people that kind of relocated. They're all over there. So gosh, hope everybody's okay.
2795000	2799000	Um, all right. Uh, anything else for your gaming week, Logie?
2800000	2823000	Uh, no, that's it. Okay. Um, my gaming week. So unsurprisingly, I attempted to play more Final Fantasy 14. Unfortunately they haven't fixed the queuing problems, uh, in a week. Uh, so a lot of the same issues are still out there. So yikes. Um, but I have found if I try to start the queue around seven o'clock, I can get in by about nine o'clock, uh, literally on Friday night.
2823000	2852000	I hopped in the queue, Alan and I went to dinner. Then we went to target. Then I got home and I'd been in the game for 15 minutes and I was about to get kicked in 15 more. So, uh, I was in the game. So we did all those things while I was waiting in queue. Most people can't do that cause they get kicked out of queue, but I've just noticed at night on the West coast, it seems to ease up a little bit. So I have more luck if I queue up at like seven o'clock and then try to get in the game by nine, but it doesn't leave me a ton of time to play.
2853000	2868000	And I have friends, several that are like all the way through the story and it's, it's frustrating cause I'm like, I don't have the time to queue up first thing in the morning and these things, it's just like, I want to be where everyone else is at so I can talk about it and I can't because of these issues and it sucks.
2868000	2888000	So, um, it is what it is, but getting kicked out of line, those issues are like my, even I love 14. I'm getting, my patience is wearing thin on those issues and they, they, they really got to figure. I'm fine with waiting in the queue as long as it's fair for everyone. It's not fair for everyone right now.
2889000	2898000	And that's the part where my patience is starting to run real thin. So I, I hope they can figure that out for the sake of the game and being able to expand the community further someday.
2898000	2912000	Um, but when I have played the game, I'm still enjoying it. There's a lot of cut scenes, a lot of stories, uh, for those that are familiar. And of course I'm not going to spoil. I'm just going to say I got past the first trial and a sequence of events that happens after that.
2912000	2924000	That's about where I'm at in the game. So I'm making my way through. Um, other stuff, my game week, I've been playing a lot of dead by daylight since I can't get into 14 after work. I've been playing more dead by daylight.
2924000	2937000	I got Jonah up to like level 35. I got whatever talent I wanted from him. Now I'm working on Michaela. I've been playing Chris. I was playing on stream with some friends this week, had a good time. So just, just, you know, playing some dead by daylight.
2937000	2951000	Uh, and then one other game I've been playing a little bit of this week. Listen up, Loki. I played Minecraft a couple of times. Yeah, I did. Cause you, you were saying go check out that new patch and you know, it was staring me in the face on Xbox.
2951000	2965000	And I was like, all right, well, while I'm queuing up on my PC for a final fantasy, I need to play something. So I was like, I'll check out Minecraft. So I played and, um, I not good at it cause I was playing survival mode and I got killed.
2965000	2975000	Like I made my little base and I tried to go to the mine, got killed really fast. I think I did that twice. And then finally I was like, all right, fuck it. I'll just play in peaceful mode. Let me live. Let me play the fucking game. God.
2975000	2988000	So, um, I've been playing that too. I haven't loved any of the worlds I've spawned on. Uh, I keep getting these world spawns that are like, I spawn on the slope of a giant fucking Hill and I'm just like, what am I supposed to do with this?
2988000	2996000	Like carve my way into the hillside, I guess, but it's not great. So, um, yeah. Yeah.
2996000	3006000	I also wish the game would give you a little more prompting, like what to do. Cause I'm like, okay, I made a house. I guess I'll go in the mine and look for shiny things.
3006000	3015000	And then I'm like, am I doing this? Am I Minecrafting correctly? I don't know. Um, well, there is no right way to do it. I guess that's true. I have to remind myself of that.
3015000	3025000	So, um, that's why maybe like survival mode feels like the things I should do because I'm like, oh, I'm leveling. I'm killing things. I'm surviving. That's the game.
3025000	3039000	But then I actually die. And then I'm like, oh, I'm not surviving. So I don't know. We'll see. It's, but I, I'm enjoying it. I thought I would be more into it this time around because I've been playing so much No Man's Sky, which is also a crafting game and a building game in a way.
3039000	3055000	So I was like, oh, there's similarities there, but I don't know. I'm not, I'm not loving it as much as I love No Man's Sky, but maybe it'll grow on me. I have noticed that it looks different than it did the last time I played like from some of these patches or whatever it is that they've done.
3055000	3067000	So yeah, they've changed. They've completely redone the world generation. So it is going to look much different. The biomes are much bigger. You have more mountains. And of course there's a larger, less mountains.
3067000	3081000	Well, no, it's what I'm saying is the, not necessarily less mountains and there's the, there are mountains, but it's not like all mountain. It's just the mountains that are in there are much taller.
3081000	3087000	And so my, my seeds, my seeds have been, oops, oops, all mountains.
3087000	3103000	That's yeah, that's unfortunate. Typically though, like it's not just like all mountains everywhere. Like usually you just had, apparently you've had some bad luck, but lucky you can get some like the seed I'm playing right now with nerdcraft.
3103000	3117000	It's mostly, it's pretty flat except for some mountains that are in there, but some of the caves though, like you're like walking over all this terrain and then all of a sudden you see this ravine and it's like, oh, this opens up into this giant cave system.
3117000	3128000	Like, and I mean, Minecraft had cave systems before, but like nothing like this, like they're massive. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. I noticed the cave system is very different too. It's kind of interesting.
3128000	3140000	It doesn't look, well, no, it even looks kind of different. Like they glow different. They have different biomes in the caves too. So like you'll have some that are like full of plants, some that have like slag tights and slag mites.
3140000	3152000	And, um, you know, some of their full water, some of full lava. I thought that was a new thing, the stalactites. I was like, I don't remember that from before. And like the moss covered cave walls. I was like, oh, this is all new. It's neat.
3152000	3170000	So there you go, Loki. I played Minecraft. Be proud of me. All right. I'm proud of you. Thank you. Thanks, Loki. It's all I ever, that's the validation I've always wanted. All right. Uh, let's get into some gaming news and talk about some other things going around on around the industry this week. We will start off with Loki.
3171000	3186000	So I don't know what it is with game publishers and like doing the dump. I mean, I guess it's this, they sense that there's easy money to be made. So Ubisoft has launched a new service called Ubisoft Quartz.
3186000	3212000	It is an NFT initiative, which allows people to buy artificially scarce digital items using cryptocurrency. People didn't like it. They've disliked the video announcement trailer quite a bit. Obviously, you can't see those dislikes normally because YouTube removed them for this very reason.
3213000	3237000	But they have other technology that, you know, plugins that people use that where they can track that stuff. So people have been disliking the video. And also people don't really care for NFTs right now, probably because the NFT scene right now, what's happening with that is you have people that are making lots of money off of dumb things like pictures of hamburgers or whatever monkeys.
3237000	3260000	And then you have like so many rug pull scams that are out there with NFTs. And it's just it's one other micro transaction now, like them getting into cryptocurrency and stuff like that. It's just, it's ridiculous. So it's just not a, I don't know, not something I'm interested in for sure.
3260000	3285000	Yeah, but it's something that like it really looks like it's pretty terrible. And then also they had these. So Quartz is basically allows you to purchase these things called digits, which are in game weapons, vehicles and cosmetics, but they're limited. And so you can sell them buy and sell them on these markets actually make money.
3286000	3312000	What I don't understand with this is remember, like, a while back, maybe because it's not loot boxes anymore or something, but like, remember a while back, like they ran afoul of all these like gambling laws, because it's like, Oh, well, they're like, Well, no, no, no, it's fine, because you can't sell these for real money. Well, now you can. So is that gonna run afoul of these gambling laws again, because it sure seems like that we're kind of treading in that territory again,
3312000	3338000	you, you, I just want to say real quick, you mentioned at the top of this, the thing that you're not sure why all these gaming companies are getting into this NFT and buy no money, it's well, it's and yeah, it's the investors, it's for whatever reason, for whatever reason, people, some people seem to think this is the future, and they are investing so much into this, I think this is where social media and some of the influence, it's very easy to influence on Twitter. Like, here's the thing.
3339000	3367000	A lot of people don't tweet about NFTs, because then they know there's going to be 510 people that reply to their tweet, telling about telling them about how they're wrong for the following reasons. Like it's that type of automation that's happening on social media, that kind of shows that a lot of this is fake, and I think is artificially driving up this sort of like interest and demand and making people think there's demand for something that there isn't really demand for, because I still can't fucking explain this.
3367000	3377000	People have told me like what NFTs are and the blockchain, all that many times, and I still can't see here and go, this makes sense to me. I want to buy this.
3378000	3400000	Think of it this way, what they're doing doesn't require an NFT at all. What they're doing is essentially like trading weapons and skins in Steam for CSGO, where you have a certain amount of items, digital items, say there's 500 of this gun skin, and you're just trading it back and forth with people.
3400000	3416000	Now, you can do that in Steam without NFTs. It's because they have a system that just tracks that, like I don't see the issue. I don't know if they're like saying, well, you can take this outside of like this ecosystem and go trade it on marketplaces and stuff.
3416000	3423000	I just think it's a lot of buzzwords to try to get the investors interested. It really is what it is. It seems like it's just completely unnecessary.
3424000	3436000	Also, like, do you really want to buy like unique skins and stuff on the blockchain, like for large amounts of money for a game that's literally going to be outdated and useless in like a year?
3436000	3449000	I mean, because that's how they do this with all these franchises. None of these games last a long time. It's not like actually it's not like CSGO where that's been around for years like this. They just recycle stuff all the time.
3449000	3459000	Like, in Ubisoft, I don't trust them. I don't trust them at all to do this correctly. So, no, sorry.
3459000	3467000	Yeah, Fifth Dream in chat says, cough, cough, blizzard in auction houses. People hated that but love NFTs. I don't understand.
3467000	3478000	Quest Buster says, it's perceived value. I remember reading about NFT bros getting upset over people taking screenshots of rare NFT art and using them as wallpaper because they could.
3479000	3480000	I don't get it.
3480000	3490000	Right. Do you not know how the internet works? Like, if I could see a picture of it on the internet, I could take a capture, I can capture that. Like, it's, it's not a real piece of art. Like, I don't.
3490000	3499000	That's why I'm surprised modders haven't made it so that these NFT items are everywhere yet.
3499000	3519000	They're probably working on them like a lot of this stuff like you know, like I said, we talked, there's one of the Paul brothers had like this thing that they use it was Adobe stock photos of animals, and they did really shitty photoshops to make them look like, Oh, look, see, it's a, it's a dog with wings.
3519000	3531000	It's like a Pokemon, buy our NFTs. And they made NFTs of that is like really cheaply, just no effort whatsoever done to try to make money. That's what these NFTs are.
3531000	3541000	Some people like are actual artists that do sell their artwork online and they can make some money like that. The majority of the people are just making a quick buck off of things that they call art.
3541000	3554000	But they're just like really shitty just little JPEGs or something like, no, thank you. I have no interest in getting that. And I have no interest, like you're not the sole owner of that piece of work.
3554000	3567000	Can someone explain this to me? Okay. Mike Deaf says support artists, not NFTs. Yes. Fifth Dream says everyone is like, but it's decentralized, except if whoever's creating the NFTs or storing the NFTs or whatever, go poof.
3567000	3577000	Who is there to provide any backing to this stuff? That's my question. Like, you know, okay, so you know, you have Bitcoin, which is like a type of crypto coin. And then there's all these other crypto coins that are similar, right?
3577000	3589000	So you have, I don't know, Ethereum, you have the Doge and all these other coins that pop everywhere. So who's to say that like, okay, you have NFTs in this blockchain. Well, you know what? I'm going to make a new blockchain.
3589000	3603000	And I'm going to call, it's not NFTs, it's FUTs. So we're going to, I'm going to sell these foots online. And it's the same thing. I'm going to sell the same thing, the exact same things, but you're in this.
3603000	3616000	So you have the receipt in this universe. We don't recognize the other one here. That currency is Nolan Boyd. We only recognize foots here. FUTs. So how about that? What's to stop somebody from doing that?
3616000	3624000	Aha, nobody has an answer. All right, let's move on. I'm a genius.
3624000	3629000	FUTs already exist and they already make tons of money off FUTs.
3629000	3632000	Oh, do they? What is that? FIFA Ultimate Team.
3632000	3637000	Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3637000	3638000	Yeah.
3638000	3648000	Everybody in Bobby's like FUTs or FIFA Ultimate Team. Bobby says NFTs are bought with crypto. Well, I'll make a crypto too. How about it?
3648000	3654000	Rob Roberts Fun Bucks. I didn't steal that from anyone. No, it's my own creation. Rob Roberts Fun Bucks.
3655000	3657000	Someone's got Fun Bucks out there somewhere, Rob.
3657000	3671000	You use it to buy FUTs. Well, these are Rob Roberts Fun Bucks. And you use it to buy. Actually, we're going to change the name. It's FUCs. You buy it. So you buy FUCs and it stands for, I don't know, I'll come up with an acronym later.
3671000	3674000	And there's the special ones that fly and they're the Flying FUCs.
3674000	3687000	Flying FUCs. Yes, exactly. So, uh, and Dark Soccer will sit here on the show going, I don't give a FUC. That's fine. You don't have to participate in the FUC if you don't want, but I'm going to have something that, you know what? It's really fucking cool.
3687000	3689000	And let's put that on the shirt.
3689000	3694000	Let's see how well decentralized platforms work too. There was one, uh, platform that just...
3694000	3702000	Wow. Bond's 006 says, I just described NFT. So what's to stop me? What's to stop me?
3704000	3713000	I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Let's go destroy a rainforest for the lols. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.
3714000	3725000	Fancy underground coins. Love it. I love it. Y'all are playing Acrophobia, one of my favorite games ever. All right. Uh, Loki, anything else you want to, you or Stella want to share on this story before we move on?
3725000	3730000	No, I had to pick her up because she fell over. She's gets disoriented sometimes.
3730000	3731000	I love Stella.
3731000	3736000	She's been yelling at me all day long. Just like, just constantly. She's just like asleep.
3736000	3739000	On your arm.
3739000	3746000	DJ Rama S in chat says, Hey Rob, how many Travis Donovan fun bucks equal to one Rob Roberts fun bucks?
3746000	3753000	Um, I would say one Rob Roberts fun buck is worth 69 Travis Donovan fun bucks. That's the official currency conversion.
3753000	3761000	So there you go. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about something else that is clearly the future.
3761000	3765000	Although this one, I actually somewhat understand a little bit, uh, and that is cloud gaming.
3765000	3779000	So, uh, rumors picking up that Sony is looking to bring PlayStation now to phones. Um, and, uh, yeah, it's interesting because we also had this week that Microsoft has apparently been working on that too, but then kind of stopped somewhere along the way.
3779000	3791000	Well, the verge made a report this week that, um, uh, one of the documents from Epic games lawsuit against Apple, uh, basically said that the iPhone maker learned Sony was planning a mobile extension of PlayStation.
3791000	3805000	Now in 2017, that would feature 450 PlayStation three titles. And then later on PlayStation four titles. Uh, and then of course it was mentioned again when Apple arcade kind of showed up, but a bus there's a whole lot of back and forth that just smoke shows.
3805000	3815000	There's a little bit of smoke that PlayStation now could potentially show up on phones and has been in the talks for quite some time. Here's the thing.
3815000	3826000	Just last week or the week before on the show, I seem to remember there was talk about that, um, patent application that was filed for the PlayStation controller that kind of snapped on the two sides of the phone.
3826000	3835000	And I was like, oh, that's probably for cloud gaming. Well, that sure lines up pretty well with this report that just came out this week. So I wonder if Sony isn't looking at doing something.
3835000	3848000	And even if, you know, due to app store restrictions or whatever, they don't do an official cloud app. I still wonder if they don't do something where the mobile phone streams from the PlayStation five, or they can do things through the web.
3848000	3862000	Of course we know is a workaround as well, which I think is what some of the other folks are doing. So I don't know. I thought that was kind of interesting. And I think, you know, especially again, after also last week, we had talk about, oh, maybe a pass that allows PlayStation one and PlayStation two games.
3862000	3877000	You have to wonder how much, um, uh, the, the cloud stuff is going to turn into that as well. So pass, you say a pass for games that they'll never work. Never, never work. I never heard of that before.
3877000	3894000	Um, E3 VL and chat says, don't you guys have phones? Uh, we do. As it turns out, uh, fifth dream says PlayStation six will only be an app. You know, you joke, but how prolific is cloud gaming going to get over the next few?
3894000	3910000	We have a story later on tonight and I guess, sorry, I'm going to just kind of say, we're going to talk about a cloud gaming device that's built into televisions now, and it's not the only one. And so I think the question of how much longer does a game console really do what a game console does?
3910000	3928000	I do think it might be kind of finite based on how fast can five G really go and how far out they're going to get away. Cause the big problem today is that like, you know, you can't stream games in four K in most places, uh, at a very clean looking, uh, sort of way.
3928000	3939000	Um, but technology is going to catch up eventually. So, Oh, it's interesting. All right, let's move on. Uh, some sad news, dark soccer.
3939000	3956000	Yeah. So, uh, one of the legends of, uh, video gaming history who is, uh, Uemura Masayuki, the, the person behind giving us the, uh, NES and SNES, sorry, I should say the Famicom, the super Famicom, um, died.
3956000	3981000	I was, uh, 78 years old, died, uh, this past Monday, which was, what day was Monday? I don't know what today is. Monday was the sixth. So, uh, but he was the same person that gave us, uh, both of those, uh, iconic pieces of video game equipment.
3981000	4003000	Um, basically was told we need something that's going to beat Atari. And there, therefore the family computer came about. Um, he actually retired from Nintendo in 2004 to become the director of game studies at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. So rest in peace.
4003000	4024000	And probably not a name that a lot of people recognize, because I don't think he was as heavily involved on the game ends of things as say, like, you know, well, yeah, I guess there was that. Um, but, um, you know, not the types of games that like, you know, Gunpei, Akoi or, uh, Miyamoto was involved with, but of course you don't have games if you don't have hardware to play them on.
4024000	4043000	Um, so this is, uh, obviously is huge contribution to many of our formative years, uh, playing the NES and the Super NES, uh, which of course were the US versions of the Famicom, uh, which was a whole, the, the, the way that the Famicom and the NES were actually very different is still fascinating to me to this day.
4043000	4054000	Like just how different those systems were, but of course, uh, we wouldn't have had it without, um, Masayuki Uemura. So rest in peace. Um, moving on to some more news, Loki.
4055000	4065000	All right. Actually before. Oh yeah. Do you know who else, do you know who else died like today? Uh, Anne Rice, right? Anne Rice, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just thought I would bring that up.
4066000	4078000	And just a quick sort of FYI, by the way, um, it's, it's storming here in Northern California and the rain is at a point where I can hear it outside, which means there's a lot of it cause I don't usually hear it from here in the studio.
4078000	4089000	So I just want to put that warning out there. If we suddenly go offline, there are storms in Northern California right now. Um, and I know everybody in OLR's history loved to joke about having a battery backup save thing.
4089000	4097000	I actually have one of those now. Um, but it actually doesn't matter because ever since we switched to Twitch, everything is going up into the cloud as it were anyway.
4097000	4107000	So, um, OLR doesn't get lost, but if it ends abruptly, I just want to put that out there. There is a storm going on right now and it sounds for California. It sounds like a pretty good one.
4107000	4113000	I don't know if you guys can hear it, but I can certainly hear it outside right now. So, all right. Uh, next story, Loki.
4114000	4125000	All right. Um, so the ABK worker Alliance has announced that there's basically, um, initiation of there's basically striking.
4125000	4131000	So they're encouraging their peers in the gaming industry to stand with them, uh, creating lasting change.
4131000	4141000	And they're also doing a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to raise money, uh, to basically kind of fight all this injustice that's going on.
4141000	4156000	And they've raised quite a bit, I think. Um, it was over like $30,000. So it's not bad. Um, actually, oh, much more at $306,000 now. So, um, not bad.
4156000	4180000	Uh, and then, yeah, it's just, it seems to be kind of escalating towards them actually forming unions. And to go along with that, the Activision Blizzard, um, higher ups have been sending out kind of union busting emails, despite the fact that they've been told not to do that.
4180000	4189000	Um, and isn't it illegal? I believe it is illegal. Yes. Um, what companies union busting has been around forever though?
4189000	4209000	Yeah. So they've, they're asking them not to unionize to which I say, can't tell me what I want. Exactly. So I, yeah, especially if they're, they're getting upset now and they're, they're seem to be kind of, you know, really trying to push back again.
4209000	4229000	That that's all the more reason I think to do it. It means you're close to what you need to get. I don't know. And if anything, you know, this is really just kind of spurred on by the fact that remember we had, was it last week or so where they laid off, you know, a third of the, um, the QA department.
4229000	4255000	Yeah. So it's just, it's only, it's only building, you know, stoking the fires of them trying to, I mean, which they really, of course, they're going to be working to try to get better, you know, benefits and better treatment at the company. So it's just, I don't know, it was an interesting move to try to do that in the middle of all of this.
4256000	4263000	It could be the interesting thing that ends up being Bobby Kotick's legacy is that he inspired game developers to unionize finally.
4264000	4272000	Yeah. So, um, I definitely not the end of this, you know, I think at some point we're going to hear that they're actually going to unionize.
4273000	4280000	I think so too. I think after, because of all the crap that they've been through and the fact that the employee demands are still not being met, I think this does end up with them. I think that's where we end up.
4280000	4292000	Um, I don't think it happens in the next month or next few weeks, but I think when we're sitting here six months from now, I think they unionize. I really do. Um, and I, uh, I think it's going to be a very interesting what happens from there.
4293000	4298000	And then that's going to start a shockwave through the industry. So be very interesting. Yeah. All right.
4298000	4309000	Well, I actually have to say that there is a lot, a lot more eyes, I think, on what's going on with them than he thinks that there are.
4310000	4326000	And I think that there's been a lot, there has been a lot more pressure on the board members to, to get rid of them. So like a lot more in the way of, uh, uh, I can't make words happen petitions right now. So I think we're going to see something happen.
4328000	4333000	I don't have much on my Christmas list, but I can think of one thing that I'd like to get for Christmas.
4334000	4341000	And that is to report on this show that he is gone. That is sure. And a hippopotamus. All right.
4342000	4347000	I want a hippopotamus for Christmas. I already have a little mini hippopotamus. His name is Mr. Smoosh.
4348000	4356000	Is that who was screaming in the background? Yes, he's walking around the kitchen screaming for no reason right now, except he probably wants food. Probably the storm outside too is probably driving him nuts.
4356000	4367000	All right. Yeah, he's fine. He is, he is not a poor kitty. He is spoiled to heck. All right. He's a, he's a spoiled kitty. All right, moving on.
4368000	4375000	Uh, let's talk about Valkyrie Entertainment, uh, based out of Seattle was just recently acquired by Sony.
4376000	4385000	Uh, Valkyrie has teamed up with, uh, several different companies, including Microsoft and Riot to help on games like God of War, Halo Infinite, Valorant.
4386000	4396000	So, uh, the studios worked on those, uh, games, uh, before they were actually bought by Sony. They were working on God of War Ragnarok in conjunction with Santa Monica Studios, uh, for Sony.
4397000	4402000	So, um, I guess not too surprised when you consider that, that Sony has, uh, decided to welcome them into the family.
4403000	4414000	Uh, still very interesting. If you look at the last year, Sony bought Housemarque, Nyxis Software, Fire Sprite, Bluepoint Games, and now Valkyrie. 17 studios under PlayStation Studios.
4414000	4425000	And certainly we think of that E3 a couple years ago when Microsoft came out on stage and was like, we bought that and that and that and that and that and that and that. Remember that?
4426000	4429000	I want the world, I want the whole world.
4430000	4438000	That was basically it. Phil Spencer came out on stage and said, I want to show you what I've done. I bought, I spent money, lots and lots of money.
4439000	4442000	It would be just quicker if I tell you which studios they didn't buy, so.
4443000	4448000	When Valkyrie was one of them, because now they belong to PlayStation. All right.
4449000	4454000	Um, let's go ahead and move on with another PlayStation story, Dark Sakura.
4455000	4472000	Yes. Um, so Sony Interactive, um, has allied their PlayStation brand with the family video game database, which, uh, parents used to learn about different video games so that they can navigate through what their children are playing.
4472000	4477000	Um, the database was begun by Andy Robertson, who wrote the book Taming Gaming.
4478000	4493000	Um, and so basically, um, the director of trust and safety at Sony Entertainment, Interactive Entertainment, uh, is on record saying the family video game database is a wonderful platform to help parents and guardians navigate the world of video games.
4494000	4496000	And we were excited to come on board as its first corporate sponsor.
4497000	4512000	So they're planning to expand the database so that it's easier to use for parents and make it a lot more accessible, uh, for people who need accessibility help.
4513000	4521000	They're also looking to also highlight games that have accessibility features and settings for making it better for everyone to use.
4521000	4532000	On average right now, it only gets about 15,000 visitors a day. And I say only because for a big site that's like this, that very much puts it in its early stages.
4533000	4543000	But it could be a good thing, especially if it's giving more transparency and truth in the games rather than, oh, the internet said this game was going to rot my kid's brain, her.
4544000	4551000	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense when you put it that way is that, you know, there is interest for Sony to get the facts about video games out there.
4552000	4562000	I mean, I know, you know, we've, we've had this in the news lately where one of those tabloid television shows try to connect, um, a recent round of school shootings to a video game.
4562000	4573000	Yeah. And it's a, it's a thing that plays out all too familiar. So of course that puts that narrative out there that like video games cause kids to, you know, turn into demons.
4574000	4580000	And I think it's nice that PlayStation is investing in a company that maybe can put a little more truth out there to an audience that needs to hear it.
4581000	4590000	So I think it's an interesting partnership. That's for sure. All right. Um, moving on next story, Loki.
4590000	4609000	Yep. So kind of talking more about, uh, the whole unionization. So we have another company now bungee is actually having, uh, folks make that same kind of, um, you know, conversations as far as discussing, you know, unionizing.
4610000	4622000	I think it's pretty much the whole industry is kind of looking at that at this point, but apparently, um, there is a report that was released talking about the workplace culture crunch hiring practices within bungee.
4623000	4638000	And of course with that, there's dozens of the stories, um, of employees that bungee, um, current and past that we're talking about, you know, poisonous company culture and how the studio slow to make change.
4639000	4644000	And, you know, crunch where, you know, you have folks working 60 to a hundred hour weeks.
4645000	4661000	Um, it's just basically kind of pushing folks to look for change and the change that they feel, you know, at this point, their unionization is going to be the way to go as far as being able to ensure that change happens.
4661000	4673000	Because leaving it up to leadership as is right now to make that change, even when it's been pointed out time and time again for years now and nothing's happening.
4674000	4676000	So they need to take their action into their own hands.
4677000	4690000	Basically, it definitely shows that there's a storm brewing and it's not just an Activision blizzard, but I mean, you know, again, this whole story about the, the toxic workplace cultures, uh, we're hearing it over and over and over again.
4691000	4703000	And it's, you know, we're all getting fed up with it. So it's no, it's no surprise that all these companies are looking towards something like unionization to help with the issues and, you know, band together that we're not going to take this toxicity in the workplace anymore.
4704000	4715000	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, before we get to the classic game of the week, I have another story here about a real classic game, uh, Pac-Man.
4715000	4724000	Um, so there's a new Pac-Man coming out. It's Pac-Man community, and it's a part of Facebook gaming, which, you know, I have a certain thought about that.
4725000	4734000	But, um, Pac-Man was released on December 6th, and basically you team up in groups of four to take on ghosts while competing for the high score.
4735000	4744000	You can also watch creators playing the game and interact with the person that's playing by taking control of Pac-Man and the ghosts from the AI.
4745000	4757000	Um, so as much shit as I give Facebook gaming, that is a pretty interesting concept that I'm surprised Amazon, especially through, um, leveraging the Luna cloud and all that stuff isn't implementing yet, but maybe it's just a matter of time.
4758000	4767000	And I think Stadia is kind of trying to get there. Um, but I'm not sure they really have that whole like hop in and play thing right now as it is, um, even if you're streaming to YouTube.
4767000	4778000	Um, so, um, the other thing with this is that, um, I really feel like the Pac-Man brand has been so diluted the past few years. Like there's just a Pac-Man thing everywhere.
4779000	4787000	There's Pac-Man 99. There's that Pac-Man game that was on Stadia. It was exclusive to Stadia. Uh, there's now this, the Pac-Man community.
4787000	4797000	I feel like they're, they're almost like licensing out Pac-Man to anyone that'll make a game. And I, I feel like they might want to be a little more choosy in what they allow out there.
4798000	4806000	Now I haven't played this. I guess so they have, they definitely have Pac-Man fever. I guess maybe it's just dollars, dollars, dollars, sell it to whoever, whoever wants it.
4806000	4815000	But I'm not sure all of these games really landed, uh, with a splash. Anyway, you know, Lord Zuckerberg had something to say about it.
4816000	4825000	Who said in a post, uh, about, you know, Facebook gaming, gaming is a big part of the metaverse and I'm looking forward to seeing games like this get more interactive and immersive.
4826000	4835000	And in a statement, Rob Roberts, a video game critic from his spare room had to say, you know, I'm really fucking sick and tired of hearing about the metaverse already.
4836000	4844000	You know what, uh, what Jamie Summers, uh, uh, big egotistical bitch on orange on radio says.
4845000	4846000	What did she have to say?
4847000	4857000	Uh, that he can suck, he can suck it. He can take that hard and sandpapery thing that everyone says they can go fuck themselves with and he can shove it in other orifices.
4857000	4870000	There you go. Put that on the back of the box. All right. Uh, all right. Well, so we have the future with Pac-Man community, but maybe we need to take a trip back to the past in our next segment.
4871000	4872000	Can we?
4872000	4893000	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4894000	4896000	And what is that classic game tonight, DarkDocker?
4897000	4908000	The classic game of the week is dragon age two. Yes. Dragon age two is old enough. It was released in duck.
4909000	4911000	No, just sigh that it's 10 years old.
4912000	4918000	It came out in 2011. It is an action role-playing game developed by Bioware published by EA.
4919000	4926000	It was the second major game that came out in the dragon age series, the successor to dragon age origins in 2009.
4926000	4941000	You play a new character named Hawk, who can be a human, mage, rogue, or warrior of one of two genders because people were not as woke back then, 10 years ago.
4941000	4952000	Basically, you go around killing things. Hack and slashing. With lots of story, lots of story, lots of story.
4953000	4961000	And lots of romancing Fenris the whole time you play the game. Anyway, that's just me.
4961000	4970000	So anyway, it began development during the time that the expansion to origins, which is awakening, was going through.
4971000	4978000	And so they looked back at the feedback for origins and made the gameplay a lot more action oriented.
4978000	4993000	They improved the eclipse engine, renaming it to lyceum, had better visuals, better lighting, and had a new art style that was inspired by the movies Yojimbo and Conan.
4993000	5002000	It brought back Mike Laidlaw, David Gator, and Einan Zor, back as lead designers, writers, and composers respectively.
5003000	5012000	The game came out for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360s, and OS X March 2011.
5013000	5022000	And it was basically considered to be pretty awesome. I mean, some people were like, oh, we like origins better. You changed it.
5023000	5032000	I say whatever because I freaking love Dragon Age 2. Dragon Age 2 was really the one that brought me into the whole Dragon Age fandom.
5032000	5043000	I played Origins and I did not like that your character didn't really speak and that just there were plenty of things that were clunky and cumbersome.
5044000	5051000	I did though like the game, don't get me wrong, but I think that Dragon Age 2 was really the first step in making the series what it is.
5051000	5065000	And so, you know, you can have a magic user. You have to watch your stamina. You can have a rogue, which I always played a rogue in this game.
5066000	5070000	Without fail, I've played the other classes and I always preferred playing a rogue.
5071000	5079000	And then of course you have your warrior type and you've got all kinds of different paths that you can take and your decisions affect the other characters in the game.
5079000	5095000	Like for example, you choose which sibling lives and then if that sibling, if it's their brother Carver, then Carver can either become a templar or a Grey Warden or can die.
5096000	5106000	And if it's Bethany, Bethany becomes either a... fuck, I always forget what the mages that live in the thing are called.
5106000	5109000	You know what I mean though, right? When they lock up the mages.
5110000	5112000	Yeah, but I forgot what it was called too.
5113000	5118000	Yeah, well anyway, she either gets locked up or becomes a Grey Warden or dies. Spoilers!
5119000	5131000	Anyway, but the thing is that this had just so much better action. The dialogue options were less confusing.
5132000	5139000	I wouldn't say confusing, but they had a better flow to them. There weren't too many repetitive items that were on there.
5139000	5146000	I mean, this is the one that introduced the similar dialogue branches like we had from Mass Effect.
5147000	5152000	So really, this and Mass Effect had a lot more in common in terms of gameplay.
5152000	5175000	It basically starts during the end of Dragon Age Origins and then goes back into the game being told from the point of view of Varric Tethras, who is a Rider who is also a Dwarven Rogue and he's also in Dragon Age Inquisition and Varric is awesome.
5175000	5191000	And he's telling the story of Hawke and their adventures and who comes into the party and what happens depending on how things go and who gets romanced and blah, blah, blah.
5192000	5205000	But then you also get, there's other DLC, you get the Exiled Prince, so you get Sebastian who can, you know, go die in a bucket of his own piss for all I care.
5206000	5212000	You also can get another bit of DLC that has Felicia Day as a character in it.
5212000	5232000	And it's just, you even get like, you know, of course, cameos from people from the first Dragon Age series like Alistair shows up as one of different things depending on what his fate was in the first game.
5232000	5240000	He's kind of funny when he's drunk. Really sad, actually, but kind of funny too. He's always funny. Alistair's awesome.
5241000	5252000	And like, Cullen comes back, which I was always very happy because in Dragon Age Inquisition, he becomes a romance interest, even though his voice actor is problematic.
5252000	5268000	But anyway, as far as the design goes, I mean, like I said, there were lots of influences going back to the works of Peter Bruegel, Sergio Leone, Akira Kousawa.
5269000	5282000	It was a lot more stylistic because they had a lot more that they could do with it. The updated engine really allowed for a lot more processing in it.
5283000	5291000	For the record, I am not talking about any specific voice actor or else I would be talking about Gideon Emery, who everyone knows his voice the moment you hear it.
5291000	5305000	Anyway, Dragon Age 2 had its co-development for both PC and console, while Origins was specifically meant more for a PC environment.
5306000	5314000	So the controls are actually a lot more versatile. You could pick it up and play it with an Xbox controller and switch to a keyboard and mouse.
5314000	5322000	I played it on my old PC. Actually, I'll take that back. I played it on Xbox and then I played it again on PC.
5323000	5329000	And then when I played Inquisition, I stuck to playing it on a computer.
5329000	5346000	But they realized that the problem was that in taking one made for a computer and then porting it to a console brought its own slew of problems, so why not just do them simultaneously?
5346000	5367000	Rather than have these big, crazy origin stories, they wanted to keep some of the narrative because they thought that people reviewed the narrative, that it was way too predictable, too formulaic.
5367000	5378000	And so they went to focus on one character over the course of years of the story rather than have these big, involved origin stories for all the players.
5379000	5388000	So they were more inspired by Planescape Torment, which is also a fantastic game, to have Hawk fully voiced, which, again, great decision. I'm behind that.
5388000	5401000	And then it was more of a reactive game, again, like Mass Effect. You don't know what your choices are going to lead to unless you play through it many, many, many times and romance the same characters over and over.
5402000	5414000	I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? Anyway, there was also a lot of some crossover from Dragon Age 2. You got exclusive weapons if you ordered it.
5415000	5420000	There's also the signature edition that had new items, new missions, a new companion, a digital version of the soundtrack.
5421000	5435000	They worked with Razer for a periphery product called the Collector's Edition product line. There was a Facebook tie-in called Dragon Age Legends, which is a 2D RPG.
5435000	5454000	Dead Space 2 got armor that was based off of Dragon Age 2 armor. I thought that the Blood Dragon armor was also available in Mass Effect 2, if I remember correctly.
5454000	5465000	But then for that DLC that had Felicia Day in it, there was also a mini-series called Dragon Age Redemption that she was in.
5466000	5470000	It acted in everything. It was a web series. I watched the entire thing and I loved it.
5471000	5476000	And then Mark of the Assassin DLC was where she came out as a guest companion.
5477000	5485000	The game got pretty good reviews. 82 out of 100 on average for Metacritic, except on Xbox 360 it got lower scores.
5485000	5500000	Generally well above average scores. Really one of the better games. In fact, a lot of people said that what they really liked was the banter that went on between some of the characters.
5501000	5508000	And that any backtracking that had to be done in the game wasn't considered monotonous, that it seemed like a different part of it.
5508000	5519000	Some people were a little bit thinking that some of the areas were pretty limited, and I guess I could see the repetition in it.
5520000	5529000	But I honestly thought that they took everything that was good about Dragon Age Origins and Awakenings and they made it even better.
5529000	5547000	There was some controversy around this, where a BioWare employee was caught posting reviews as a consumer on Metacritic, giving it a 10 out of 10.
5547000	5556000	And they don't know if he did it on his own as a fan of the game or if the company asked him to.
5557000	5572000	It was also criticized for using the SecuROM digital rights management software. Even though BioWare had said no, they only put that in as a release date checker that would delete itself after it was released.
5572000	5595000	They also were under fire for allowing same-sex couples in the game, and it was pretty disgusting that they were asking for that to be removed from the game.
5595000	5604000	And Gator was like, no, this isn't going to be an inclusive game, and we're going to have it available for everybody, so screw you. He didn't say so screw you, but I said so screw you.
5605000	5618000	And also that year, it outsold Pokemon Black and White worldwide and sold more than 1 million copies in less than two weeks, which was faster than its predecessor.
5618000	5630000	By May 2011, it sold over 2 million copies. There were tie-in novels, there was Dragon Age Asunder, and then of course the game Dragon Age Inquisition came out after that, which was amazing.
5630000	5647000	And from the Legacy DLC, the villain from that, Corypheus, was the bad guy in Inquisition, and Hawk shows up in Inquisition as an NPC. So there you go.
5647000	5660000	Lots of tie-ins to the other games, of course, and definitely a game that had an impact. Dragon Age 2, the classic game of the week, and I know one that Sakura spent a lot of time with.
5661000	5663000	And in roughly two more years, I can do Inquisition.
5664000	5673000	All right, we'll be waiting. All right, there you go. Let's get into some rapid-fire news and quickly talk about some other news from around the industry, and I think we will start with Loki.
5674000	5696000	Yep. So, this is kind of funny. So they've been doing the whole interview circuit with the Matrix movies right around the corner, and Keanu Reeves, for some reason, was asked about folks modding Cyberpunk 2077 to have intercourse with his character in the game.
5696000	5703000	And to which he thought, I know, that's of course the question that comes up.
5704000	5710000	It happens. If it's possible, it happens. Just going back to Dragon Age, I mean, I'm saying porn mods.
5711000	5725000	Yeah, he says, explain that the dev had the mod banned, because they were not sure they had permission to do this, and I guess he reacted with genuine sadness.
5725000	5746000	Basically, he's endorsing it. Oh my god, it's always nice when it's nice, and you know, Kerian Moss did not share that same sentiment, so please do not mod the Matrix Awakens demo to have intercourse with her.
5749000	5750000	Noted.
5750000	5770000	Noted, yes. And then, and then, you know, with the commercials and everything, Epic Games Store wants to let you know that they have a cutting edge technology called a shopping cart now. So that's right, you can purchase games more than one at a time.
5770000	5777000	Wow, and the Epic Store has only been out for what, like five fucking years? Nobody would be...
5778000	5780000	It's technology that's so difficult to program.
5781000	5797000	If it were not for the free games and the exclusives, if it were not for the money they were throwing, they can throw all this money at free games and all this money at landing exclusives, but they can't throw money at actually creating a decent storefront.
5797000	5805000	Blows my mind. Blows my mind. Nobody would be using that fucking store if it wasn't for the exclusives and the free shit.
5806000	5819000	Maybe it's because people don't buy stuff off, people don't buy things that often from Epic Games, and so why do we need a shopping cart? I mean, they're just adding the free game that we give them each week, and that's about it.
5820000	5821000	You can add a bucket with holes in it.
5821000	5839000	Yeah, and then what else? Oh, also you can review and remove items from the cart and move content to your wish list. You know, features that are on every storefront nowadays.
5839000	5849000	Loki, what's next? Prepaid cards? Gift codes? Don't get crazy now.
5850000	5869000	I know. Pie in the Sky type stuff here. Maybe they could partner with Nintendo and they could work some stuff out. Nintendo can show them the storefront stuff, Epic can show them networking things. Maybe it could be a synergy.
5870000	5873000	I don't know. It sounds like a lot of interesting stuff going on in that kitchen.
5873000	5884000	Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Maybe we don't have Nintendo show them their storefront because eShop is pretty terrible, so they're both screwed, I guess.
5885000	5894000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Epic apparently wanted to do a skit at the Game Awards announcing the shopping carts, and Jeff said no. Good job, Jeff.
5895000	5911000	What? I mean, I know some of those announcements were a stretch, but wow, we added a shopping cart to our store. That's a real fucking stretch right there. Like, congratulations. Welcome to Amazon.com when it launched in 1997.
5911000	5915000	Do they want praise for that? Like, should we...
5918000	5924000	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, please take us to a different topic.
5925000	5927000	How about Dead by Daylight? We talk about that none at all, right?
5928000	5929000	We never talk about that on this show.
5930000	5950000	Heck no. So anyone who has Amazon Prime, if you go to gaming.amazon.com slash loot slash Dead by Daylight, you can get codes. Apparently, they're going to be doing a code every month for in-game content, and this month is two pallet swaps, really, of a new outfit for the artist, for Carmina herself.
5951000	5955000	Who I've played for the first time today, and I'm really bad with her.
5956000	5957000	I'm not great at her.
5958000	5960000	But she's kind of fun. I like her level.
5961000	5963000	Yeah, I think she's a great design.
5964000	5967000	For friends in chat, I'm going to put the link in here. So there you go.
5969000	5979000	And then Grand Theft Auto Online is getting a story expansion featuring Dr. Dre. Yes, and Chop the Dog is still around.
5980000	5985000	I wish that the single players would get a story expansion, but I guess there's no money in that.
5986000	5990000	Also, it's the return of Franklin. Franklin has to find Dr. Dre's phone.
5992000	5999000	Unfortunately, people were trying to put Grand Theft Auto in their carts, but were unable to do so until this week, so they weren't able to sell the game, Loki.
6000000	6003000	Speaking of the carts, I'm sorry, it's just too much comedy gold from chat.
6003000	6009000	As 200 Matt in chat says, they're working on GeoCities gifts and website view counts for their next update.
6010000	6014000	Oh boy, I hope there's a Dancing Hamster website that Epic Games is about to unveil.
6017000	6026000	Anyway, all right. By the way, on the Dead by Daylight thing, I can't remember if I caught you saying that, but I think I heard that it's six months, and this is just the first month.
6027000	6029000	That they're going to be giving away shit for like six months.
6030000	6031000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
6032000	6037000	All right. If you do have the game, you should be logging in every day anyway to get your blood points.
6038000	6039000	That's what I've been doing.
6040000	6043000	I got up to gold four, finally, in Survivor. Yay!
6044000	6051000	That's ironic that you mentioned about logging in each day to get blood points, because that's how the metaverse works as well.
6052000	6056000	You have to log in each day to get your blood points. At least that's what they say.
6056000	6062000	I'm still working on getting all of my base killers to their first round of 40 to get all their stuff teachable.
6063000	6072000	Which I only have two left to go, and then I'm going to start prestiging... I plan on prestiging Pig and Freddy last, because I play them the most.
6073000	6076000	But I'm going to start prestiging those fuckers I don't touch.
6077000	6082000	Which killer would you be putting off because you hate them? I'm going to guess one of them is Trapper, because everybody hates Trapper.
6083000	6084000	I don't mind Trapper.
6084000	6091000	I did a cool thing with Trapper. I have to talk about this and no one is going to know what we're talking about, but this is really cool and you'll get it, Rob.
6092000	6093000	Hurry up, because we have to get to Korea States.
6094000	6103000	You know in the Gideon plant where there's the big square hole that's just all by itself? I just put a trap at the bottom of it just for shits, and three people fell on it.
6104000	6107000	I'm like, don't you people talk to each other? You're a fucking swiff. Anyway.
6108000	6109000	Okay. Anyway.
6110000	6112000	That was smart, okay? That was smart.
6112000	6120000	Let's get to our release dates around the world, and we'll start with the US. Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?
6121000	6123000	Not a whole lot, but we do have things.
6124000	6150000	So, we have Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo on PC, Alien Isolation on iOS and Android, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate on PC, Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, The Gunk on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, and Record of Lotus Wars.
6151000	6152000	Lodoss.
6153000	6158000	Record of Lotus Wars, Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth. That's it.
6159000	6164000	That's the Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth thing, isn't that kind of an old thing?
6165000	6172000	And that's also out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X. It's probably re-release or port.
6173000	6174000	Well, I thought...
6175000	6176000	Yes, it came out a while ago.
6177000	6178000	I think it's based on one of the books.
6179000	6180000	Well, the original game...
6181000	6182000	It was on PC.
6183000	6185000	And it's relatively new.
6186000	6187000	Let's see here...
6188000	6191000	No, it came out earlier this year in PC.
6192000	6193000	Okay.
6194000	6198000	I thought it was something older. It might have been something based on one of the books, so I might have been mistaking it.
6199000	6200000	Don't know.
6200000	6203000	All right, looking at Japan. A pretty busy week on the Switch in Japan this week.
6204000	6208000	Death Smiles 1 and 2. It's in English, but it's getting a Japanese release this week on the 16th.
6209000	6213000	Hashihime of the Old Book Town, also an English game being released in Japan this week.
6214000	6219000	That same Record of Lotus War, Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth, is also out on in Japan this week.
6220000	6223000	As is LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and Among Us getting a retail release.
6224000	6226000	Pui Pui Molcar. Let's Molcar Party.
6226000	6230000	I don't know what a Molcar Party is, but that is coming out in Japan this week.
6231000	6235000	Also on the Switch. And that one is getting a collector's edition with that as well.
6236000	6240000	I'm trying to see what this is. It looks like they're chibi little animals like hamsters and sheep.
6241000	6243000	And what are they doing? Are they just playing dress-up?
6244000	6245000	It looks like they just play dress-up in this game.
6247000	6250000	But it looks cute. It kind of looks like Little Big Planet, but with animals.
6251000	6254000	And it's a bunch of mini-games. Oh, it's a mini-game collection type of game.
6254000	6259000	Oh boy. A price reduction on Earth Defense Force World Brothers and Monster Hunter Rise
6260000	6262000	as they are re-released into best hit style collections.
6263000	6266000	And that is pretty much all you get on the Nintendo Switch this week.
6267000	6272000	Looking at the PlayStation 5, that Among Us Crewmate Edition is out on PlayStation 5
6273000	6276000	as is that Record of Lotus War that was brought up earlier.
6277000	6279000	So there's your Japanese releases. Dark Sakura.
6280000	6285000	Three things. Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy, the definitive edition on the 14th.
6286000	6291000	Among Us Crewmate Edition also on the 14th. And on the 17th, Disney Classic Games Definitive Edition.
6292000	6293000	There we go.
6294000	6301000	DJ Rama S, by the way, with the information here, the Lotus War game is already out, but it's being released in physical form.
6302000	6306000	And that does happen sometimes. And that is probably the same thing with the Among Us release
6306000	6310000	because E3VL says what's in the Crewmate Edition. It probably is a retail release
6311000	6314000	and it probably comes with like, I don't know, hats or whatever they put in there.
6315000	6319000	It's like DLC. There's probably a few of those. So that's probably what, you know, it's a retail release
6320000	6325000	because, you know, if grandma knows the kids love Among Us, then they'll probably buy it
6326000	6333000	to put under the Christmas tree or the Hanukkah bush or whatever it is in the home later this year.
6333000	6340000	So, all right. That's it for release dates. Let's go to some more stories.
6341000	6343000	Oh, Loki, I feel like we're back to where we started, aren't we?
6344000	6351000	Yeah, yeah. So, you know, just when you think that, yeah, you know, you're just wondering,
6352000	6358000	what is Peter Milano doing? You know, I'm sure he's got some cutting edge thing that he's trying to push,
6358000	6364000	you know, whether it's a dog, a boy, a cube. Oh, no, it's NFTs.
6365000	6373000	So he has a blockchain business sim featuring NFTs and it's his game called Legacy.
6374000	6383000	And, yeah, I'm sure he's hyping the heck out of it. But like, we've we have to have known by now
6383000	6392000	that, like, we can't trust anything he says. Like, it'll never be good, I guess, or at least as good as he says.
6393000	6396000	And the game looks like a cheap mobile game. So, no thanks.
6397000	6402000	You know, it's tough because I enjoyed black and white. I enjoyed Fable.
6403000	6406000	I even tried that what's in the cube thing because I thought it was kind of interesting.
6407000	6411000	But I've got to admit, I'm at this point where, you know, Peter Milano and he gets up there
6411000	6417000	and he talks about this and all I hear is blah, blah, blah. And honestly, I just don't give a fuck.
6418000	6421000	I just don't give a fuck. I don't.
6423000	6425000	Dark Sakura, do you give a fuck?
6426000	6427000	Huh?
6428000	6431000	About Peter Milano's latest NFT project? Do you give a fuck?
6432000	6433000	Fair enough. All right.
6434000	6436000	Nintendo Entertainment Systems, I give a fuck about that.
6437000	6440000	Quest Buster says there's also that goddess game. Oh, yes, there was though.
6441000	6444000	That was a big member that. Oh, God, there's so many things wrong.
6445000	6451000	I remember there was one thing like wasn't like a contest or something like that where someone got the run part of like they got to make decisions about the game.
6452000	6455000	And that was what was in the cube. That's what was in the cube.
6456000	6459000	What's in the cube? The Kickstarter. Remember that?
6460000	6465000	Bobby Blackwell and Chad says the thing about Peter is that he truly believes in what he's doing and he is genuinely excited about it.
6466000	6468000	Well, I'm glad someone is.
6471000	6476000	And that's how he gets in trouble because he gets too excited and talks too much out loud too early.
6477000	6480000	Oh, yes. Ask ask that guy from Hello Games how that went for him.
6481000	6483000	All right. Moving on.
6484000	6490000	Let's talk about Stadia because Stadia is baked in now to LG TVs.
6491000	6494000	It was supposed to happen a while ago. It was held up for whatever reason.
6494000	6501000	But anybody that has an LG set that is running Web OS 5.0 or 6.0. So it has to be 2020 model or newer.
6502000	6508000	You can now use Stadia so you can play the games that are on Stadia such as Dark Sakura plays her beloved Dead by Daylight there.
6509000	6514000	But you will have to, of course, have some sort of controller. You could use the Stadia controller.
6515000	6519000	But you can get common console controllers to work to either wirelessly or through USB.
6519000	6524000	So if Dark Sakura had an LG TV, she could pick up where she left off from her Mac and play on her TV.
6525000	6528000	Although I'm sure Dark Sakura is like, why would I play with the controller? And I get that.
6529000	6533000	But if you wouldn't mind going back and forth, this is an option for you as well.
6534000	6539000	So, yeah. And, you know, I was going to bring this up now if I hadn't already earlier.
6540000	6547000	But it kind of goes back to the talk about will there even be a game console 10 years from now?
6547000	6553000	I mean, I'm sure there will be, and I'm not trying to be one of those things that's like cloud gaming is going to take over everything.
6554000	6557000	Because I think there's always going to be a space for that physical copy as well.
6558000	6569000	But will it be as prolific? Will it be that same split, especially when you look at, again, movies and TV where a lot of gaming has taken its cue?
6570000	6573000	It's not to say the Blu-rays are done for and gone. They're not.
6573000	6583000	But you know what's taking up a lot of the conversation? Netflix, Hulu, Paramount Plus, Amazon, et cetera, et cetera, when it comes into that space.
6584000	6591000	So I do think it's kind of a matter of time with this cloud gaming stuff. It's just the gaming's got a little more going on than TV does.
6592000	6598000	And so they have to wait for the technology to catch up. But for simple games, it sure seems to work pretty well.
6598000	6605000	And even more complex games like Dead by Daylight, I don't hear Dark Sakura bitch about the experience. It seems to work quite well for her.
6606000	6610000	It plays great to me. You do need good internet for it, but it plays fine.
6611000	6616000	Right. So as Joan Hunter-Matt says, I just bought a new LG TV. Maybe I'll try it someday. Yeah, let us know.
6617000	6621000	I'm pretty sure there's a couple of games that are free just if you get in there so you can kind of test it out with.
6621000	6634000	Like Destiny was at one point. I don't know if it still is. And it was DTRMS says which model LG TVs? It has to run WebOS 5.0 or 6.0. Not 4.0 def, sorry.
6635000	6642000	And it has to be, I think that was a 2020 or newer model. So if your TV is a couple of years old, sadly, it probably won't work.
6643000	6646000	But all the more reason to get a new TV. Just kidding.
6647000	6649000	Okay, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6649000	6656000	So there is a twin stick game called Bulk Slash and finally it has an English fan translation.
6657000	6671000	So yeah, you can use your Saturn twin sticks to play this game. It's got dubbed voices, all English menus, all of the dialogue, everything has been translated.
6671000	6682000	So you can now play an SDF fighter pilot with other people who get to kill things with their mecha.
6686000	6691000	There you go. We love to see English translation patches for games that are many, many, many years old.
6692000	6693000	Especially Sega Saturn stuff.
6694000	6695000	Yeah, I thought you'd like that news.
6696000	6697000	Yeah.
6697000	6698000	All right. Loki.
6699000	6708000	All right. And then we've been covering the lawsuit between Nintendo and Bowser.
6709000	6714000	There's so many Bowsers out there, but this is Gary Bowser, who was part of Team Executor.
6714000	6728000	And they've agreed to a settlement now of $10 million in regards to his company selling the hacking tools or mod chips for the Nintendo consoles.
6729000	6734000	So that's a lot of money. Hopefully he made a lot of money from all that.
6735000	6738000	I can't imagine paying $10 million back. File for bankruptcy?
6739000	6742000	$5 a week? I don't think he does.
6742000	6744000	I don't think he does. I think that's the gag.
6745000	6750000	So, Dr. Seuss says, I mean, you'd think he would want to stay off Nintendo's bad side.
6751000	6752000	Yeah, he hasn't really been doing a good job doing that.
6753000	6765000	He kind of has to because there's a permanent injunction against him worldwide, you know, without regard in territorial scope of specific intellectual property rights asserted in the complaint.
6766000	6771000	Basically, he can't do any more circumvention of their copyrights.
6772000	6781000	All right. And one more story for you guys. And this is going to make you feel really old.
6782000	6784000	Well, maybe not. I don't know how many of you are over the age of 45.
6785000	6790000	Okay, one of us is. But here's the thing.
6791000	6800000	Well, Dark Sakura, you're in good company because the Fairchild Channel F turned 45.
6800000	6804000	Of course, it was one of those early, early consoles that was released.
6805000	6813000	This 1972 was the first console, the Magnavox Odyssey, and the 1976 brought us the Fairchild Channel F.
6814000	6816000	So that was one whole year before Atari.
6817000	6819000	But did you ever have a Fairchild Channel F?
6820000	6821000	Dan did.
6822000	6826000	And the Fairchild Channel F was notable because it used cartridges, right?
6827000	6829000	So we've talked about that in the past on the show is that, you know,
6830000	6835000	modern gaming was created from the Fairchild Channel F.
6836000	6837000	A designer of color.
6838000	6844000	Yeah. And of course, you know, that was one of the big legacies that Fairchild brought to the table.
6845000	6851000	Of course, their own developments were soon kind of taken over by Intel and Zilog and all that.
6852000	6854000	But it still made its mark.
6854000	6861000	The Fairchild had an 8-bit processor inside of it and 64 bytes of RAM.
6862000	6866000	Not 64K, 64 bytes.
6867000	6872000	Needless to say, that's a lot to cram into the read access.
6873000	6878000	It had a palette of eight colors and the resolution that it could output was 128 by 64.
6879000	6881000	That was the resolution it could output.
6881000	6885000	There was also an internal speaker on this thing and that was not great.
6886000	6893000	Later models, however, used the TV speaker, but the Fairchild never really super caught fire with that.
6894000	6900000	Some of the games that were released, things like Alien Invasion, Pro Football, Checkers, and so on.
6901000	6909000	So just a reminder of the Channel F, which admittedly I never played one because I missed it growing up.
6909000	6913000	My first console was Atari and I think I had a friend with an Intellivision.
6914000	6916000	I knew of an Odyssey, but I never played one myself.
6917000	6919000	I had a lot of gaming books that would talk about them.
6920000	6923000	And I think I even had some that talked about Fairchild F, but I never really played one.
6924000	6925000	You know what I had?
6926000	6927000	You had an Odyssey.
6928000	6930000	Oh no, I didn't have the Odyssey. My friends had the Odyssey, too.
6931000	6932000	I own an Odyssey now.
6933000	6935000	But I had the TI-99 4A.
6936000	6937000	And I had the ColecoVision.
6937000	6940000	Yes, yes. So many systems back then.
6941000	6942000	I still have my ColecoVision.
6943000	6950000	It's so interesting to think about now how like, oh gosh, there's the Nintendo Switch and there's this Xbox and PlayStation.
6951000	6953000	That's a lot. And then there's PC and Stadia.
6954000	6956000	And then it's like, okay, go back to the early 80s.
6957000	6963000	It was like the Atari 2600, the 5200, the 7800, the Commodore 64, maybe the Commodore 128 or the Amiga.
6964000	6965000	Or maybe it still ran on a VIC-20.
6965000	6967000	And then there was the TI-99 4A. There was the ColecoVision.
6968000	6973000	I mean, you get the point. There's just the early IBM PC Juniors and all this delay.
6974000	6975000	It just goes on and on.
6976000	6978000	There's just so many freaking consoles back then.
6979000	6984000	I used to love those ads that would show like the Parker Brothers Frogger game.
6985000	6989000	And it would show nine different screenshots from all the various consoles.
6990000	6992000	Commodore 64 and everything else that it would play on.
6992000	6995000	So, yeah, just awesome. Anyway.
6996000	7000000	All right. Now is the part of the show where you get to have a say.
7001000	7002000	Oh, of course, you've been chatting with us all night.
7003000	7005000	But even the folks listening on the podcast feed, you can always send us an email.
7006000	7009000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
7010000	7014000	And if you want to give us a call, you can also hop into our green room on our Discord server.
7015000	7017000	I still need suggestions, by the way.
7018000	7019000	For, remind us?
7020000	7021000	For classic, whatever, whatever.
7022000	7025000	For the classic blah-de-blah in 2022. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7027000	7035000	Oh, thank you. Bobby points out from his last show, the Arcade 1UP Tron video was uploaded to our YouTube channel.
7036000	7039000	And if you're not on our YouTube channel, I can't say I blame you because we haven't added a lot.
7040000	7041000	But there are some things on there worth looking at.
7042000	7046000	So, VOG Network. If that isn't the most honest plug for a YouTube channel.
7047000	7049000	It's all right. I mean, there's a few things there.
7049000	7054000	You should check it out. VOG Network on YouTube as well. So, be sure to check that out.
7055000	7058000	Did we have any emails, Dark Soccer? I didn't, don't remember seeing any. Okay.
7059000	7064000	Well, y'all flopped, but that's okay. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
7065000	7071000	You know, we've had a rule here historically that when we don't get any emails, then you are basically asking Dark Soccer and I to talk about Drag Race.
7072000	7074000	But I have to admit, I haven't, I don't watch all these international spinoffs.
7075000	7078000	Like, that's how I get tired of Drag Race real fast. So, I found a fun username.
7079000	7081000	On one of the Twitch chats that made me laugh.
7082000	7083000	Okay. What's that?
7084000	7085000	Pandora's lunchbox.
7086000	7089000	Oh, that's pretty good. But I mean, Pandora box wasn't just a drag queen.
7090000	7096000	And you know this, of course, but you know, it's, it, the name is funny because it ties into, you know, ancient, ancient stories.
7097000	7102000	Yeah. And all that stuff. So, who's to say that comes from the drag queen, but it might, you never know.
7103000	7104000	So, all right.
7104000	7105000	All right.
7106000	7109000	Oh, Ongina was doing a charity stream earlier today.
7110000	7114000	Oh, yeah. I thought I followed her, but I don't see that. Maybe I'm not following her.
7115000	7120000	And, and I, I got asked that if I ever play survivor, that Ongina will let me play with her.
7121000	7122000	Oh, that's fun. You should.
7123000	7126000	One day. If I ever decide to break out survivor cherry.
7127000	7128000	Break the ice. Get it over with.
7129000	7132000	Ugh, I need people to teach me.
7132000	7139000	You, you're already learning by hunting them, but yeah, I mean, I'm happy to, I'm happy to hop on voice chat and yell at you.
7140000	7148000	All these people are like, oh, oh, you'll be a better killer if you play survivor. I'm already a better killer watching survivors. I know your tricks.
7149000	7154000	That's true. You learn a lot watching other people, but because before I was playing that game, of course I watched a lot of Twitch.
7154000	7163000	And I think this goes for almost any game, uh, watching people on Twitch, uh, gives me the most honest reviews and honest takes on any game.
7164000	7169000	Like when I was kind of trying to decide, do I want to do New World or do my just going to stick with Final Fantasy 14 for now?
7170000	7179000	Like watching Twitch streamers was a big part of that. And I will say New World did look fun, but you know, I'm kind of in bed with Final Fantasy 14 right now.
7179000	7185000	Although I don't know, sometimes these queue times, but I'm, the problem is I'm paid through February because I play, pay three months at a time.
7186000	7191000	So it's like, well, I'm stuck with it now. So there is that. All right.
7192000	7199000	Well. Yes. Well. Well, Wells are, I'm not going to play New World. You don't have to, nobody's going to force you to.
7200000	7205000	I'm also on a Mac. Oh, is it not on? I can, I can never remember what is and is.
7205000	7212000	I think I'm kind of over the idea of playing a colonization game. The theme is problematic.
7213000	7217000	Uh, but I don't want to chase turkeys like all, like all of our friends do.
7218000	7224000	Final Fantasy 14 is on a Mac. There is, I know I play, I play that. I'm not touching that until that shit storm has calmed down.
7225000	7233000	I can't say I blame you. They're talking about opening. Like if they open new servers, I was trying to remember what the last update said, and I think they are still trying to open new servers.
7233000	7247000	And we're kind of at the point where we might jump ship and do it. And like, there's a part of me that kind of doesn't want to, but also I'm kind of like, why did that gigantic wow streamer who's getting all the media attention.
7248000	7257000	Who decided to try Final Fantasy 14 and stick with it. Why did he have to pick the server I'm on and now cause all these Q issues to be exacerbated?
7257000	7261000	I tried to join a random one and it put me right back on Midgar Samar.
7262000	7267000	Oh, interesting. So I just played my old character. Why not? Hopefully it won't matter. Level 70 right now.
7268000	7274000	That's it. That's the other reason why I'm open to server hopping somewhere. It's not going to matter soon. It was 6.1. You're supposed to get the cross data center play.
7275000	7283000	Hopefully, hopefully all this other stuff doesn't screw all that up, but we'll see. All right. Let me check in with any last minute stories from Loki or otherwise.
7283000	7295000	Nope. Got nothing. I know it was pretty slow week in the news. Other, well, I mean, we taught, I mean the game awards, I shouldn't say it was a slow week, but I feel like outside of that, there wasn't a lot, a lot, a lot going on, but that's typical of this time of year.
7296000	7309000	Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, um, yeah. Pretty much winding down. Yeah. I understand. All right. Well, I think this show will wind down as well then and we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but I want to thank you guys for participating with our show tonight.
7310000	7318000	Whether you were here live with us on Sunday nights over at VOG Network, or if you are participating with our podcast, thank you very much for being a part of the show. Appreciate it.
7319000	7330000	A word of mouth goes the long, goes a long way. You know, we, we don't ask for your money, but we do ask you to tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and we want more voices at the table.
7330000	7341000	Um, so, you know, a nice tweet or a share on social media goes a long way. Uh, you can also tweet us by the way, at OLR. I read them all, even if I don't read them on air. Um, but I appreciate it. Sometimes I respond to them.
7342000	7355000	Um, and, uh, yes, there's Twitter at OLR. One of the few Twitter accounts now that has under four because we've grabbed that name along to, they don't let you make names with under four letters anymore. So we have a, we have a valuable Twitter account, I suppose, at OLR.
7355000	7365000	Um, and the problem is we get tagged with other things that have the acronym OLR. Like there's some school. So how dare you dare. Yeah, I know. Right.
7366000	7384000	It's our acronym. It's our acronym. Um, anyway, um, we still don't have a store yet. Hoping that'll be resolved in the next couple of weeks. So sorry, this limited edition shirt I'm wearing. Uh, we don't have another one yet, but hopefully soon. So, but our soccer has a store. She'll let you know that.
7385000	7400000	All right. Um, that is it. Uh, join our discord, vognetwork.com slash discord, and we can continue the conversation throughout the week. Um, thank you again for being here tonight and, um, yeah, we'll be back in seven days to do it again, of course, with whatever
7400000	7408000	news should come up in the next week. And of course, now I need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. So Dark Sakura, I don't know if you're, you're still streaming tonight, right?
7408000	7414000	I'm going to go for it. I'm pretty tired, but I'm going to try to do it for a little bit. I guess I'm going, going live early.
7414000	7421000	Yeah, I know we kind of wrapped earlier, but hey, that means I'll be done early. All right. I just dreamed for three hours, so we'll see. All right.
7421000	7424000	So, uh, any final thoughts before we let you go?
7424000	7434000	Um, I have managed to fall prey to Whamageddon, which I don't mind because I actually like that song, but I'm still free of the Moriah apocalypse.
7434000	7445000	I saw an interesting take online where somebody was like, I don't do the Whamageddon. I celebrate Whammas or something where I try to hear that song as many times as possible because it's a good song and y'all should stop hating it.
7445000	7447000	I thought that was a neat way to look at it.
7447000	7454000	I do though have to thank Joe for warning me before playing that song so I can mute the stream.
7454000	7463000	Because I think, I think he was honoring my five year Moriah free holiday season.
7463000	7467000	Noted. All right. Thank you. All right, Dark Soccer. Have a good stream. Thanks for being here.
7467000	7468000	I'm out. Bye.
7468000	7471000	All right. Uh, Loki, we'll go to you next with your final thought.
7471000	7479000	Uh, my final thought is I've done a lot of random early game stuff in Minecraft today and I had to figure out how to make that into an episode.
7479000	7485000	Oh, maybe a, uh, off season episode or something, a special episode.
7485000	7500000	Well, no, no, it's, it's in, in season. It's just, uh, it's like, there's not really much structure there because a lot of stuff I did, I did off camera because it's not fun to watch someone just branch behind for a long time.
7500000	7502000	So, yeah.
7502000	7509000	Um, I'm going to keep trying to play Minecraft so I can guess on one of your guests on one of your YouTube someday. It'd be fun.
7509000	7510000	All right.
7510000	7511000	Yeah. Anytime.
7512000	7525000	Uh, and that's, that's it. I don't have a lot of final thoughts. I'm just gonna, I just need prayer circles that the, uh, Final Fantasy cues get better this week so I can finish the story because I've already been spoiled thanks to a Google news headline of all places.
7525000	7533000	So, uh, a big F you with the week to click bait websites that post articles in the headline that have major story spoilers.
7533000	7544000	Um, and F you to Google news for knowing that I like Final Fantasy 14 and showing that to me. Uh, so F you to those things. Uh, I guess that felt good as a final thought to bring back the F use the week because that was on my mind.
7544000	7554000	Uh, otherwise I'm in a pretty good mood, so we'll see you guys in seven days. Thank you guys very much for being here. Have a great week. Thanks for being a part of orange launch radio. We'll see you next time. Good night.
