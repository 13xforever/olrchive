0	13560	It's another week and another Groundswell launch with rampant service issues.
13560	17840	But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe mashups,
17840	21960	ongoing social sagas, new release drive, remasters and re-releases, and a couple of glitches.
21960	26040	It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums, and video games, the things
26040	28880	we hold near and dear to our hearts.
28880	32240	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details
32240	36240	of all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36240	47000	Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
47000	53600	We are live once again with our first show for the month of December, if you can believe
53600	54600	it.
54600	58960	It's December the 5th of 2021.
58960	65000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my friends as I have been for the last, oh gosh,
65000	66320	almost 20 years now.
66320	68480	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68480	69480	Hello.
69480	71920	Hi Jamie, how are you?
71920	72920	I'm doing.
72920	73920	Yeah?
73920	74920	You're doing?
74920	77400	Still withdrawal is a bitch.
77400	78400	Yeah.
78400	79400	I hear you.
79400	80400	I hear you.
80400	82840	I have a friend visiting in the background on camera.
82840	83840	Do you?
84080	87480	I did some changes to the studio computer.
87480	92080	My preview is very small, so it's hard for me to see you guys totally, but I see a little
92080	94200	lump on the chair.
94200	95200	Yeah.
95200	96920	Blending in with the black cushions.
96920	97920	I gotcha.
97920	98920	Well, hello, Minda.
98920	99920	Good to see Minda.
99920	101480	You can see her eyes.
101480	102560	We love a cat cameo.
102560	104520	We always do.
104520	106560	Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
106560	107560	Hello.
107560	108560	Hi, Loki.
108560	109560	How are you?
109560	110560	I'm doing good.
111080	115680	Live on Twitch, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,
115680	120080	9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, live
120080	123480	on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.
123480	124600	That's VOG network.
124600	128920	And as we are broadcasting live, there's a video playing behind Loki as there usually
128920	129920	is.
129920	130920	What is this?
130920	132840	It is Minecraft, I'm seeing, right?
132840	133840	Yeah.
133840	135880	It's the last episode that I put out.
135880	140560	So I ended my season on Collusion MC.
140560	142000	So yeah.
142000	148640	Well, congratulations on your first season and getting canceled, but new and better things
148640	149640	in store, right?
149640	152680	Well, it's not getting canceled.
152680	159320	They just started their second season, actually, and I've been playing on it since I'm waiting
159320	165520	for the NerdCraft server to start because they're waiting for some server RAM.
165520	166520	Gotcha.
166520	167520	Un-canceled.
167520	168520	Saved by Netflix.
168520	169520	All right.
169520	172880	And I noticed in chat, S2100 Matt is commenting on your beard.
172880	174080	Loki's beard is coming in thick.
174080	175080	I'm impressed.
175080	177080	Are you trying to grow out your beard?
177080	178080	No.
178080	179080	No.
179080	180080	It's lazy.
180080	181080	I understand.
181080	182080	I understand.
182080	184000	For what it's worth, it's quite fetching.
184000	185320	Thank you.
185320	187200	It's also probably the flannel too.
187200	189640	I've been kind of on a flannel kick lately.
189640	191720	The whole Lumberjack chic.
191720	195040	It is the weather here in Northern California for a Lumberjack dress.
195560	196560	I don't blame you.
196560	197560	I don't blame you.
197560	201720	I was in my onesie until about five minutes ago, and then I realized I get really warm
201720	203000	under these lights.
203000	207120	I love playing video games in my little office in my Snuggie.
207120	209760	Yes, I still rock the Snuggie blanket.
209760	213080	Do they even still run those commercials on TV?
213080	214080	Here I am chilling a product.
214080	215600	There's a different thing now.
215600	216600	Is it?
216600	217600	Well, I still-
217600	218600	It's like a cloak thing.
218600	219600	Yeah, that's right.
219600	224720	There's like a demon cloak that they sell now, but I still rock that blue Snuggie that
224720	228640	they sent me, or that I bought, that a friend sent me.
228640	231200	This blanket that I'm wearing was free.
231200	232200	Nice.
232200	233760	And it is older than Julian.
233760	234760	Aw.
234760	235760	I love that.
235760	236760	And it's warm.
236760	237760	Oh my God.
237760	238760	How old is that kid now?
238760	239760	I think he's got to be like 16, 17.
239760	240760	13.
240760	241760	Oh, I thought older than that.
241760	242760	No, he's going to be 14 in April.
242760	243760	Oh, wow.
243760	244760	Still.
244760	245760	Still.
245760	246760	My gosh.
246760	253240	And of course, that's Dark Soccer's BFF, yeah, her kid, and who's been on the show before,
253240	254240	but it was a while ago.
254760	258040	I understand we have probably some new listeners since several years ago when Julian came on
258040	261040	the show to talk about, I think, Minecraft and Puzzle Pirates and the types of games
261040	262520	he was into at the time.
262520	263520	So yeah.
263520	267160	He was doing Pirates 101.
267160	268160	That's it.
268160	269160	I'm sorry.
269160	270160	It was Pirates 101, not Puzzle Pirates.
270160	271160	I get them confused.
271160	272160	My bad.
272160	273360	All right.
273360	274680	Let's jump into some gaming news.
274680	278720	That's what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio for the next few hours.
278720	283800	And yeah, the news is picking back up this week after the holiday Thanksgiving week that
284360	285360	we had last week.
285360	290880	The news is starting to pick up as people are returning to work for the rush before
290880	294600	the end of December and a lot of breaks that people take towards there in the new year
294600	296240	and all that good stuff.
296240	298360	So the news is picking up again.
298360	302640	And we start tonight with a story about a game I play an awful lot of.
302640	306400	So I'm going to get into my gaming week a little bit early, but I'm sure many of you
306400	310740	out there, even if you don't play this game, you've been reading about this and you probably
310740	314460	thought, you know, Rob might have something to say about all this tonight and you would
314460	315460	be correct.
315460	320860	And this has to do with the launch of Final Fantasy 14's latest expansion, Endwalker.
320860	321860	So here's the deal.
321860	327320	Technically, Endwalker launched in early access on Friday, which means if you had a digital
327320	332060	preorder code or I think any type of preorder code, if you actually got one, I heard some
332060	333980	stores are having problems delivering on that.
333980	338420	But if you got a preorder code, you got to get into the game on Friday, even though the
338420	342100	expansion doesn't actually launch until Tuesday.
342100	345860	The reality of that is, though, that that is the launch day.
345860	346860	Like let's be real.
346860	349220	You know, Final Fantasy 14, it's been growing.
349220	350280	It's bigger than ever.
350280	352060	It's got a lot of more fans.
352060	355180	And yeah, and they've been hyping up this expansion.
355180	358300	And who doesn't want to play the brand new expansion when it comes out?
358300	360060	So Friday was the launch day.
360060	362700	Like Samantha, everything else is just semantics.
362700	367820	And I think part of that has been to hide issues like what's been happening this weekend
367820	368820	in the past.
368820	374140	For example, a lot of folks in the community joke about Raobahn EX with the Stormblood
374140	375140	launch.
375140	378740	And that was a problem that happened when they launched the expansion two expansions
378740	379740	ago.
379740	383340	Stormblood was that there was a character, Raobahn, and you had to talk to him to start
383340	384340	a solo mission.
384340	387700	Well, the problem was so many people were hounding him.
387700	391540	In a nutshell, he was having a problem cuing everybody for the solo instance.
391540	394780	He started rejecting people and you couldn't proceed past this point.
394780	401140	And it was pretty early on in the story and it got really frustrating for a lot of people.
401140	405740	But what happened is that that ended up being, oh, well, that was part of early access, early
405740	406740	launch.
406740	410700	And by Tuesday, when the real launch happened, they were able to patch that and fix that
410700	411780	and all that good stuff.
411780	416060	So most of the time they've been able to kind of hide behind, well, all the problems were
416060	421460	during early access and that's kind of what it feels like it ends up being.
421460	423700	Here's something very interesting that happened this year.
423700	426940	And I think we talked about it last week, or at least I remember tweeting about it.
426940	429440	It might've been something that came out early this week.
429440	436020	The producer behind Final Fantasy XIV, Naoki Yoshida, and his team came out and said, and
436020	439060	I'm going to paraphrase here the way I interpreted it.
439060	443460	And they said, there are going to be server problems when this game launches.
443460	448220	We have tried everything we can to try to mitigate this, but you are probably going
448220	453220	to have problems and you're probably going to have to wait in a queue to play the game.
453260	455500	And, well, he was right.
455500	459300	A lot of that has been being hit.
459300	465780	He also said, because a lot of people wondered if they knew this game was bigger than ever
465780	469480	and they knew they had so many pre-orders that were sold, why didn't they try to buy
469480	473780	more equipment, even if temporary, to boost the servers?
473780	477840	And here's the fascinating thing about this scenario, they did.
477840	480540	Naoki Yoshida said, we tried.
480580	486180	We can't get the parts because of the semiconductor shortages.
486180	493280	So, in other words, they could not expand the server space to accommodate this expansion
493280	496140	because of crypto and NFT.
498380	501580	Although he didn't actually phrase it that way, but I'm going to go ahead and phrase
501580	505560	it that way because that is a big part of what's causing the semiconductor shortage.
505560	508220	But it still was a fascinating situation.
508220	510980	We've been following games a long time.
510980	513820	We've been playing a lot of MMOs.
513820	516280	We collectively have played a lot of MMOs.
516280	519100	I don't just mean World of Warcraft.
519100	524740	I mean Final Fantasy XI, Ragnarok Online, hell, I remember touching Ultima Online for
524740	528740	a hot minute and there's a lot of other things collectively we've tried.
528740	533200	I don't know about you guys, I can't ever think of a time where the developers actually
533200	540960	came out and warned, this may be a problem and we tried to mitigate it and we couldn't.
540960	543200	So this is uncharted territory.
543200	550360	Well, sure enough, the game launched on Friday, everybody wanted to get in, and there's queue
550360	552320	problems out the wazoo.
552320	556440	And here's the thing, the queue system, you know, you've seen a lot of screenshots on
556440	561400	social media from your friends that play Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sure, with these LOLWTF queue
561400	562400	times.
562400	565920	5,000 people in queue, 10,000 people in queue, and just like a ton of people waiting to get
565920	567160	in the game.
567160	572240	And I think I can speak for most of the fans, there's always going to be the extreme opinions,
572240	578800	I think I can speak for most of the fans and say, the 5 and 10,000 person queue actually
578800	585780	really isn't the problem, yes, it's unfortunate, yes, it's a long wait, but you warned us,
585780	587780	and that's not the problem.
587780	589320	Here's the problem.
589320	592140	People are getting kicked out of that queue.
592140	595540	And an unexpected error will happen after a little bit of time, you're going to get
595540	599440	an error that says 2002, a lobby error.
599440	604160	And when people see that, and then they click OK, and they go and they get frustrated, whatever,
604160	608200	eventually they try to get back in, and oh, they're back at the end of the line, please
608200	612680	wait 5,000 people to get back in the, and of course people are not signing out.
612680	615280	So yikes.
615280	618940	So people get very frustrated because like, I don't mind waiting in line, it's when I
618960	621220	get kicked out of line that I get pissed off.
621220	625860	Now, you may or may not know this, Final Fantasy XIV people, they're challenged with this right
625860	632640	now, 2002 specifically apparently has a workaround, and I've done this myself, I did it 5 times
632640	637580	last night, I got kicked out of queue 5 times in a 4,000 person queue last night, and this
637580	639540	worked every single time.
639540	643480	You have to keep an eye on it, because if you're able to click OK, log back in the game,
643480	648800	even if the game kind of errors you out like 3 or 4 times, keep trying to force your way
648800	649800	in.
649800	653200	If you can get back in that queue in like 5 minutes, you will not lose your place.
653200	655080	If it's a 2002 error.
655080	656340	And I don't think a lot of people know that.
656340	659640	I think they give up, they get frustrated, and they go do something else, which I totally
659640	660640	get.
660640	663480	Here's the other problem, and again I speak from this from experience.
663480	668320	There are other errors besides 2002.
668320	673060	Last night, I tried to sign into the game at a later hour, about 930 Pacific, I figured
673060	676560	it's after midnight Eastern, people were going to start going to bed, so I started to sign
676560	678760	into the game at 930 Pacific.
678760	684840	Suddenly at 11 o'clock, I'm down to one person in queue, which I think is a fake message,
684840	687040	but it says one person in queue.
687040	692400	And then error 4004, I get kicked out of the game.
692400	695960	And I go, all right, well, I'll just do what I usually do, log right back in.
695960	701320	I log back in, please wait 3,950 people.
701320	707360	And that was the point when I said, all right, I am not doing this again until I hear the
707360	708760	queue problems are resolved.
708760	710400	Yes, I want to play the game.
710400	714100	Yes, I'm frustrated, I'm seeing people all over social media tweeting about the story
714100	715840	and how great it is.
715840	720640	I was able to play quite a bit on Friday, so I'll be thankful for that, I guess.
720640	725120	I got through the 81 dungeon in that part of the game, but it is very clear that is
725120	728440	all I'm going to get until they work some of these issues out.
728440	729440	So how are they going to work it out?
729440	730440	What are they going to do?
730640	737200	Well, now Kiyoshita did post an update today about everything that's going on.
737200	741480	And in the update, there was a lot that he actually went over, sorry, I'm trying to bring
741480	743240	up the story here.
743240	748080	Okay, so he actually apologized for the congestion.
748080	753280	And this was one thing that really struck me actually is that in the statement, he says
753280	756540	a few times he says, I'm sorry.
756540	758700	He doesn't say we're sorry.
758700	761980	He doesn't say sorry, you are having a problem.
761980	764300	He says, I'm sorry.
764300	768540	I want to point that out, highlight it, underline it, because this is why Naoki Yoshida, despite
768540	774080	all these issues, is really respected by the Final Fantasy 14 game player base.
774080	777660	Gaming executives take note, that is accountability.
777660	779700	I'm sorry.
779700	783420	Not we're sorry, or sorry, you are having a problem.
783420	784420	I'm sorry.
784420	787020	I think there's a lot of executives that can learn from that.
787020	791200	And certainly there's something about the culture, you know, and so forth and why a
791200	795620	Japanese based company is probably treating this a little differently than I think if
795620	798940	certain other companies were having this problem.
798940	803740	He does go on to say that all players are going to be awarded with seven days free gaming
803740	804740	time.
804740	807980	So basically, you're going to get seven days of time for free because of these issues,
807980	813180	which is, I mean, what else literally can they do?
813180	816260	This is the weirdest situation.
816260	819600	The game is too popular for its own good.
819600	827040	It is literally too popular and they cannot expand because of supply shortages.
827040	831980	So literally, and he did say in the statement, seven days for now.
831980	836500	But if this keeps continuing, paraphrasing, if this keeps continuing, we're going to look
836500	838440	at doing more.
838440	842600	So I mean, I appreciate that, you know, as a Final Fantasy 14 player who is frustrated
842600	845140	with the lost time on Saturday, I do appreciate that.
845140	850100	I'm not sure what the fuck else they can do at this point.
850100	855380	So people are talking about, well, those of us that have been 3,000 subscribed for 3,000
855380	858600	days, we should get priority and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
858600	863080	Please allow me to say this as somebody who has been playing Final Fantasy 14 since 1.0
863080	870700	and the alpha for A Realm Reborn, shut the fuck up and stop gatekeeping this game.
870700	873860	You're being an entitled bitch right now and you need to stop it.
873900	876040	So that is not going to fly.
876040	880020	There needs to be a fair solution that works for everybody.
880020	885380	And really what the solution is, they just, they need to figure out why is 2002, why is
885380	890500	4004, why are these issues kicking people out of line when they're in line?
890500	895240	Naoki Yoshida in the statement does continue to try to like explain what the networking
895240	896240	problems are.
896240	902020	He says there could be problems if you're on Wi-Fi versus wired and basically pledges
902020	905580	that they're going to work on those types of issues.
905580	912580	But outside of that, I honestly don't know what happens besides those that are able to
912580	917360	wake up at four in the morning and start signing in when nobody else is signing in and get
917360	920340	in the game and have burned through all the content.
920340	925340	Those people are going to get bored because they're going to hit the top and nobody else
925340	926340	is there.
926340	927340	It's an MMO.
927340	929960	There's nothing else to do.
929960	933700	And I think those people will get bored and hopefully stop logging in and then eventually
933700	937080	people can catch up and hopefully things will find its rhythm again.
937080	940320	I think they need to delay the release of the raid content.
940320	944560	And I know that is not a popular answer and people are going to hate me for that, especially
944560	949720	end game content raiders, but the rest of us need an opportunity to get there.
949720	954540	And I think they need to cut back on the fever to get to the end as fast as possible.
954540	956840	They need to delay the launch of the raid content.
956840	959600	And I know, again, that will not be a popular decision.
959640	964280	I kind of don't care because, again, I think people need to stop gatekeeping Final Fantasy
964280	970380	14 and the raiders can wait two more fucking weeks because, quite honestly, there's a part
970380	974800	of me that really feels this game should have been delayed further.
974800	978780	And I know that would have frustrated me as a fan, but I really think they should have
978780	982820	looked to delaying it to earlier next year when they could have gotten some of the semiconductor
982820	984160	parts and all that good stuff.
984160	986820	And again, as a fan, that would have been super frustrating.
986820	992300	But in retrospect, I kind of wish they just would have delayed it to early next year.
992300	999260	However, I also understand investors, money, fiscal year, this is Square's cash cow right
999260	1000260	now, blah, blah, blah.
1000260	1002540	That probably was never a plan that was going to fly.
1002540	1004680	Two weeks was probably bad enough.
1004680	1005740	So I get that.
1006740	1008740	I'm going to chat for some comments.
1008740	1015460	VXJ6V, sorry, Jason, our voiceover guy, VXJ6V says, Big enough is never enough.
1015460	1021100	These issues at scale, Final Fantasy XIV, wow, et cetera, will never be fixed.
1021100	1022620	True.
1022620	1026580	Questbuster in chat says, hearing that kind of perspective from the developers is frankly
1026580	1027580	refreshing.
1027580	1028580	Yikes.
1028580	1030860	And then Mike Deft goes on to say, Yoshi P is a godsend.
1030860	1033060	Fifth Dream says Yoshi P, best game director.
1033060	1038180	Like I said, Final Fantasy XVI, no pressure at all, right?
1038180	1039180	Anyway.
1039180	1040940	I have one more hot take on this.
1040940	1042020	You guys want to hear this?
1042020	1047180	Because I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you who is to blame for these issues.
1047180	1051860	And I'm going to name one specific individual who is to blame for these issues.
1051860	1054180	And it's not Yoshi P. It's not who you think.
1054180	1055740	You guys want to hear my take?
1055740	1056740	Sure.
1056740	1057740	Thanks.
1057740	1059740	Thanks for the reassurance.
1059740	1060740	Here it is.
1060740	1065700	Here is who to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch problems.
1065700	1068540	Bobby Kotick.
1068540	1073300	Bobby Kotick is the person to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch issues.
1073300	1077580	Some of you probably are already starting to connect the dots on why I'm saying this.
1077580	1079620	Please allow me to explain.
1079620	1084060	Final Fantasy XIV is more popular than it's ever been before.
1084060	1085260	Why?
1085260	1089180	World of Warcraft, unfortunately, has been starting to tank.
1089180	1090540	People are turning away from the game.
1090540	1094380	And I know I have friends that are still very loyal to that game, but I think they're loyal
1094380	1097180	to their communities, not the game.
1097180	1102620	And you're starting to see communities in massive numbers start to go over to Final
1102620	1104100	Fantasy XIV.
1104100	1107420	In fact, you know there's been a lot of streamers that have done it.
1107420	1111900	I know a lot of the media says, Asmongold, Asmongold, sure, there was him and he has
1111900	1113800	a lot of influence online.
1113800	1118660	For every Asmongold, there's plenty of other smaller streamers and their communities that
1118660	1120700	are going over to Final Fantasy XIV.
1120700	1123620	Again, I don't intend to gatekeep Final Fantasy XIV.
1123620	1125740	I welcome all of those people.
1125740	1130500	But it is the cause for why the popularity has gone through the roof and why we see these
1130500	1135860	reports that more people were playing Final Fantasy XIV on Steam this last weekend than
1135860	1137520	ever have before.
1137520	1140100	And Steam is just one place to play the game.
1140100	1141640	You can play without Steam.
1141640	1142800	You can play on a Mac.
1142800	1146300	You can play on a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.
1146300	1150580	So this game is clearly more popular than it's ever been before because people are leaving
1150580	1152180	World of Warcraft.
1152180	1154180	Why are people leaving World of Warcraft?
1154180	1157580	When did people start leaving World of Warcraft?
1157580	1161420	When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?
1161420	1163760	Can you all think of a point in time?
1163760	1165700	When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?
1165700	1168620	Dark Soccer, when did it start getting bad?
1168620	1171820	Right after whatever came after Legion.
1171820	1177700	And that would have been right around the time that Activision purchased Blizzard.
1177700	1178700	What else?
1178700	1181740	Not Burning Legion, not Burning Crusade, but like Legion.
1182140	1183140	Yeah.
1183140	1186300	Um, and those would have been pro- that was a little bit after, but you could say that
1186300	1191640	those are the expansions that started under Activision's watch, uh, most likely.
1191640	1194240	And what else happened with the Activision takeover?
1194240	1200380	These horrible things that we're hearing about on the side with the sexual harassment and
1200380	1202980	the threats to kill people and all this disgusting shit.
1202980	1207300	I really don't want to rehash tonight, but please refer to earlier episodes or literally
1207300	1211140	anywhere else on the internet right now about what is going on with all that.
1211140	1216380	But all of that behavior ended up driving out the talent at Blizzard.
1216380	1221300	I mean, one of the few really successful things Blizzard has been able to launch under Activision's
1221300	1223400	watch was Overwatch.
1223400	1228000	What happened to the creative director of Overwatch recently?
1228000	1229000	He left.
1229000	1230000	He left.
1230000	1232020	Why did he leave?
1232020	1233780	He was sick of Activision's bullshit.
1233780	1238100	I'm very much reading between the lines, but if you read the report from the staffs and
1238100	1243620	everything like that, that man, Jeff Kaplan, would often protect his teams from the bullshit
1243620	1246800	Activision corporate overlords.
1246800	1251740	So Blizzard started going downhill, WoW started going downhill when Activision started taking
1251740	1252740	over.
1252740	1257460	And what is preventing Blizzard from- why are people continuing to leave Blizzard?
1257460	1261800	You just saw in the news, one of the big tweet folks this week who was instrumental in putting
1261800	1265340	together a better ABK and all this stuff, she's leaving Blizzard.
1265340	1266720	Why is she leaving Blizzard?
1266720	1271640	Because Bobby Kotick still refuses to resign.
1271640	1274580	So hopefully now the dotted line path is clear.
1274580	1279520	The person responsible for your Final Fantasy XIV issues this weekend are crypto miners,
1279520	1283880	NFT folks, and Bobby Kotick.
1283880	1286000	That's it.
1286000	1290440	I also want to remind everybody Bobby Kotick should have resigned probably years ago, but
1290440	1293880	those issues that just came up in the Washington Post are about three weeks old now, and he
1293880	1295880	still has not resigned.
1295880	1300140	And yep, I'm going to bring this up a lot until he does, because we need to keep the
1300140	1303200	pressure up on him and the board.
1303200	1308400	And we have a story coming up a little later, you know, little Rob Roberts in his spare
1308400	1314360	room on his dinky little podcast probably doesn't matter, but some folks that matter
1314360	1318220	are starting to put the pressure on, and we'll get to that later in the show.
1318220	1322220	But it's, yeah, it's very interesting.
1322220	1323220	Going to chat.
1323220	1325940	SJ100Matt says it all comes back to Voldecotek.
1325940	1327500	Yeah, what?
1327500	1331940	I mean, I know some of you guys are going to think I'm like being dramatic or whatever,
1331940	1333580	and you know, whatever.
1333580	1334920	But think about it.
1334920	1342740	Why would Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft all come out and talk about their concerns about Activision?
1342740	1348580	Because all of this affects them too.
1348580	1352240	Questbuster in chat says, I remember when ATVI said years ago they would stop reporting
1352240	1356740	subscriber numbers for World of Warcraft in their quarterly fiscal reports.
1356740	1360840	Everything I'm hearing, and this is hearsay, I have no facts to back it up, so take it
1360840	1366540	as that, is that the game is in worse state subscriber numbers than it's ever been, and
1366540	1370220	it is classic keeping it afloat right now.
1370220	1374660	But again, that could be just social media hysteria, I have nothing to back that up.
1374660	1376380	But it all comes back to Voldecotek.
1376380	1377380	Garbage.
1377380	1378380	Yep.
1378380	1383920	So anyway, I don't know what else to say about the login issues.
1383920	1391400	You know, as a Final Fantasy XIV player, sure, I'm frustrated, but we were warned about it.
1391400	1393500	And I kind of like, I see it for what it is.
1393500	1397420	Like Yoshi P is doing the best damn job he can.
1397420	1399340	Like he tried to get the parts.
1399340	1401180	He can't get the parts.
1401180	1402180	Like what?
1402180	1404300	I feel bad for him.
1404300	1407820	I don't know what else he can do.
1407820	1411060	But I think they need to push back the raid content and they just need to slow the timetable
1411060	1415100	down so that everybody has a nice chance to consume the content.
1415100	1420740	And the reality is, the power users and the people that are already level 90, I mean I'm
1420740	1424840	sorry folks, maybe you're on a low pop server or something like that, but the focus needs
1424840	1430380	to be taken off that group and give them, purposefully, less things to do so they stop
1430380	1431380	logging in.
1431380	1434020	And it's not going to be a popular resolution.
1434020	1438340	I think it's the only resolution at this point.
1438340	1439340	For now.
1439340	1440340	But we'll see.
1440340	1444340	Maybe in a week they fix some of these other issues, and maybe during the work week less
1444340	1448860	people are deciding to take off work to play a video game expansion and stuff.
1448860	1450780	Look I've done it before too, I get it.
1450780	1453540	And maybe the numbers will help thin out a little bit, but we'll see.
1453540	1454540	We'll see.
1454540	1457620	So anyway, those are the issues going on with Final Fantasy XIV's launch.
1457620	1459900	Otherwise I'm going to say this, I know we're getting into our gaming weeks, I'm getting
1459900	1460900	a little ahead of myself.
1460900	1466660	I will say this, Friday night, when I was able to play and get past the level 81 dungeon,
1466660	1471940	and I'm not going to spoil or say anything about the story, I'm just going to say, there's
1471940	1474980	a lot of things done really well in this expansion.
1474980	1481420	I'm really hooked into the story already, and a lot of the Final Fantasy IV references
1481420	1484660	are so good.
1484660	1490580	Right up to the level 81 dungeon has a ton of them, and I was giddy doing that dungeon
1490580	1491580	for the first time.
1491580	1495660	I am having some sound tearing issues, and some technical problems I didn't even get
1495660	1498100	into yet.
1498100	1502020	I don't know if that has to do with the launch or what, but I'm not going to bore you all
1502020	1503460	with my technical problems.
1503460	1507300	I was able to power through it, and I really loved what I experienced so far.
1507300	1511420	And yeah, I'm bummed I can't be the first through the story like everyone else wants
1511420	1513820	to be, but it is what it is.
1513820	1516340	Anyway, let's get to everybody else's gaming weeks.
1516340	1520080	I do have other stuff I can talk about later, but traditionally we start with Dark Sakura,
1520080	1522800	so Jamie, how was your gaming week?
1522800	1525760	It was lots of Dead by Daylight.
1525760	1530600	If you log in every day, it's sort of, I like how Bourbon said it, it was like a sort of
1530600	1532880	an advent calendar sort of thing.
1532880	1538320	You log in every day, you get blood points or iridescent shards or different things in
1538320	1539320	game.
1539320	1540320	So definitely you're playing Dead by Daylight.
1540320	1542420	Oh, a lot of mobile phone games do that incentive thing.
1542420	1544040	Daily login bonus.
1544040	1546280	But this is not a mobile game.
1546280	1548200	Well, I mean, there's a mobile version, but this is the-
1548240	1550120	I know, but it's the same concept.
1550120	1551120	Yeah.
1551120	1554480	And there's also a couple of blood point codes floating around.
1554480	1555480	One is Ho Ho Ho.
1555480	1556480	What'd you call it?
1556480	1561480	Girl, you know you a ho, OK?
1561480	1562480	Anyway.
1562480	1566000	And so I've been doing that.
1566000	1567400	I've also been playing a lot.
1567400	1572040	I'm calling it a game for right now, but just because I got it on Steam, but I'm playing
1572040	1576840	in Vroid Studio trying to work on an avatar.
1576880	1580760	Not that I think I'm going to be a VTuber or anything, but who knows, it'll be good
1580760	1584720	for those days where I don't feel like doing makeup.
1584720	1595440	And then I've been playing my wordscapes and we have ACDC pinball back in the house now.
1595440	1601440	And Dance Buddy Will has been over, so there's been a lot of pinball going on in my house.
1601440	1605080	And I picked up another game on Steam today.
1605080	1610360	There's a sale going on for the same company that does No Man's Sky.
1610360	1614680	Oh, I know the game because I played a little bit of it.
1614680	1615680	Go ahead.
1615680	1616680	What game?
1616680	1617680	The campfire game.
1617680	1618680	No.
1618680	1620920	Oh, I thought you said it was, OK, go ahead.
1620920	1624840	It's the same company, but I didn't get that game.
1624840	1632340	I got one, gosh, it's called Chime Sharp.
1632340	1636380	It's like a music Tetris-y, puzzle-y game and it looks pretty interesting.
1636380	1639260	Hmm, I'll have to look that up.
1639260	1644200	I hate the art style in it, so I'm never going to buy it, but I love the little avatar they
1644200	1645200	have for it.
1645200	1646980	It's Kitty Powers matchmaker.
1646980	1651780	It just makes me think that that's like a drag queen trying to hook people up.
1651780	1654020	I think it's adorable.
1654020	1655740	Kitty Powers love life.
1655740	1658980	Just the Kitty Powers character is really, really hilarious looking.
1658980	1661260	Actually, I think that is a drag queen.
1661260	1662260	But anyway.
1662260	1663260	Yeah.
1663260	1665140	She was at the first GamerX, if I remember right.
1665140	1672220	Yeah, but I was looking at, I wanted to play some of those escape room games, but they're
1672220	1676220	not Mac and I'm still waiting on my VHS key.
1676220	1680180	Oh yeah, that game looks cool.
1680180	1681180	Yeah.
1681180	1682700	I've been watching Dro play it a lot.
1682700	1686100	It's been really, it looks really interesting.
1686100	1693980	I still think I might like Dead by Daylight still better, but I also, speaking of Dead
1693980	1700020	by Daylight, when I go on my medical leave, I will be televising my mental breakdown live
1700020	1702140	on the internet.
1702140	1706340	So there we go.
1706340	1707340	I look forward to it.
1707340	1714220	I know I was going to say Jamie, I mean, but I can appreciate that you are doing something
1714220	1719620	that you have done for a while as like that routine thing to kind of keep you grounded
1719620	1720620	through the process.
1720620	1723260	I think, I think is the nicer way I'd put it.
1723260	1724260	Yeah.
1724260	1728260	And actually Dark Tetsuya is mentioning that Dead by Daylight is free on the Epic Games
1728260	1729260	Store.
1729260	1730260	It's free until the ninth.
1730260	1731260	Yes.
1731260	1735860	And we have been seeing a lot of baby killers and baby survivors as a result, and I'm looking
1735860	1737860	forward to killing them all.
1737860	1743940	And just a public service announcement because I know it is very
1743940	1744940	well-intentioned.
1744940	1748300	I appreciate people want to make sure we're in the loop on that.
1748300	1754180	I have been told more times than I can count on my hands that DVD is free on the Epic Store
1754180	1756020	and we did bring it up on last week's show.
1756020	1757020	So many fucking people.
1757020	1758020	Thank you though.
1758020	1761640	I appreciate people think of us and so forth, but I just want to be clear.
1761640	1762640	We know.
1762640	1763640	Thank you.
1763640	1767820	I just took the opportunity to remind people that it's going to be free until the ninth.
1767820	1769300	Let me flip it in a positive way.
1769300	1772100	And we want you to get it before the ninth.
1772100	1773100	Don't tell us to get it.
1773100	1776180	We know you get it before the ninth.
1776180	1779600	That's the positive spin I'm going to put on it.
1779600	1787380	But at any rate, if you do start playing during this period, don't be discouraged.
1787380	1790560	You will die many, many times, survivors.
1790560	1792860	You will die.
1792860	1797340	And if you are a killer, be prepared to get lots and lots of teabagging throwing your
1797340	1798340	way.
1798340	1799620	It's going to happen.
1799620	1802740	You are not going to win your first match.
1802780	1804900	Darth Tetsuya in chat says, y'all sucked me in.
1804900	1805900	Congratulations.
1805900	1806900	There you go.
1806900	1807900	Let's put in.
1807900	1808900	Let's put a notch on the wall.
1808900	1809900	There you go.
1809900	1810900	One down.
1810900	1813860	SSG100 Matt, I think is trolling.
1813860	1816700	Oh, you can get it free on the Epic Game Store.
1816700	1817700	Yes.
1817700	1823140	But as a reminder, also on Game Pass for you Xbox slash Windows Game Store affectionados.
1823140	1824140	So.
1824140	1826860	And none of y'all can get the Demogorgon and it'll be your loss.
1826860	1827860	Yeah.
1827860	1828860	That's okay.
1828860	1829860	There's better killers.
1829860	1830860	All right.
1830860	1834580	Everybody is adorable, but do you know what this means, Rob?
1834580	1835580	You know what this means?
1835580	1836580	Huh?
1836580	1837580	No more toxic chips.
1837580	1838580	Ahoy, Steve.
1838580	1839580	Oh.
1839580	1840580	Or whatever.
1840580	1842820	Oh, there's plenty that already bought this.
1842820	1846260	There's plenty of them already there, but there won't be any more added to it.
1846260	1847260	All right.
1847260	1848260	Scoops Ahoy.
1848260	1849260	Or Broccoli Nancy.
1849260	1850260	It's it's.
1850260	1853020	What was his, what was his like Ahoy hat?
1853020	1854020	It's Scoops Ahoy.
1854020	1855020	Scoops Ahoy.
1855020	1856020	Scoops Ahoy.
1856020	1857020	That was it.
1857020	1860460	Well, no more Scoops Ahoy, Toxic Steve and no more Broccoli Nancy.
1860460	1863860	I will say, and this is the last I'm going to say on this because we do need to move
1863860	1865660	on from a topic besides Dead by Daylight.
1865660	1870420	But um, and, and, and, and my husband, Alan said that, or maybe you had said this, Jamie,
1870420	1873460	I'm confusing you with my husband and that's starting to worry me, Dark Soccer, but we
1873460	1875420	spend that much time together.
1875420	1879840	Um, one of you said this and that maybe I think you both did, and that is that they
1879840	1884720	have that skin for Jonathan in the game that is a replacement for Steve and that's cool,
1884720	1890220	but they really missed an opportunity before they pulled the rights to have an alternate
1890220	1895740	for Nancy, who is the other Scoops Ahoy girl that was in season three.
1895740	1896740	That is.
1896740	1897740	I didn't say that.
1897740	1898740	Okay.
1898740	1899740	Then it was Alan.
1899740	1900740	Who's Uma Thurman.
1900740	1901740	I wanted Barb.
1901740	1902740	Who's Barb, but Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke's daughter.
1902740	1906140	I don't remember her name, but she's, she plays that.
1906140	1908380	She would have been a great addition.
1908380	1909940	I loved her character.
1909940	1914700	So anyway, no, we just have extra Nancy.
1914700	1915700	Yes.
1915700	1916700	All right.
1916700	1918700	Anything else for your gaming week?
1919180	1920180	No.
1920180	1921180	Okay.
1921180	1922180	Then we'll go to Loki.
1922180	1923180	Loki.
1923180	1924180	How was your gaming week?
1924180	1931580	It was video editing and Minecraft, so, uh, it was finishing up season one, which we have
1931580	1934740	the last episode playing behind me, um, on video.
1934740	1936740	You're watching the video.
1936740	1941980	And so basically I was finishing up the last episode of season one of collusion because
1941980	1947060	they are resetting their, well, they have reset their server as of Friday and I've actually
1947060	1948060	been playing on that.
1948500	1952100	The plan is, I'm not sure if I'm going to be making content on here.
1952100	1956500	I may make a few videos on here, but primarily I'm going to be on nerd craft season two,
1956500	1958180	whenever that launches.
1958180	1963280	So the way I've been kind of playing it is the collusion stuff's going to be more just
1963280	1969920	like kind of low key, um, not really going to like stress on making like large builds
1969920	1970920	and stuff like that.
1970920	1974320	Just more kind of having fun and just playing regular Minecraft.
1974320	1981040	Like today, for example, I built a community farm for, um, a blaze spawner, so blaze farm
1981040	1984740	for the community to use because they had one set up on the server last season.
1984740	1987760	So I figured, you know, I'll pitch in, in that kind of sense.
1987760	1992460	And then the other thing I want to do is like, um, if you take a boat on ice, they go really
1992460	1993460	fast.
1993460	1997400	And so you can make like a drift course with those and around the place where I've set
1997400	2002020	up my base, um, just tons of huge ice reversed.
2002020	2003820	So I may make a course through that.
2003820	2008680	So that kind of stuff kind of contributing to the server, but once, you know, the nerd
2008680	2012900	craft stuff launches, I mean, playing primarily on there, but I'll come back and visit the
2012900	2014260	server as much as I can.
2014260	2019020	Cause it was kind of hard cause you know, I was torn leaving the server in the first
2019020	2023380	place because there was really no one playing for the last like four months, which is like
2023380	2024900	half of the season.
2024900	2025900	And so it was tough.
2025900	2029300	Like if I want to grow my channel, I can't really do that when I'm not interacting with
2029300	2030620	anybody.
2030620	2034820	I kind of felt bad cause they understood why and they're very cool about it.
2034820	2039420	And you know, they're insistent, like, listen, we know that you're not going to play on here,
2039420	2040420	we'll keep you white listed.
2040420	2041940	You can come visit as much as you want.
2041940	2043420	And I was like, okay, well fine.
2043420	2047580	I'll, I'll, I'll play as much as I can and like support, you know, as much as I can.
2047580	2052700	And I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, definitely, um, kicking right now we've got, you know,
2052700	2055940	there's probably like eight players playing at all times.
2055940	2057820	Plus they have voice chat now, which is cool.
2057820	2058820	The proximity chat.
2058820	2059820	Oh, cool.
2060020	2061500	So it's been, it's been kind of fun.
2061500	2065460	So running into different people and they're trying to build a little bit closer together.
2065460	2067820	And so they're just kind of getting that server stuff off the ground.
2067820	2072540	We finally come back and visit, but yeah, once we get into the new season, um, with
2072540	2076540	a nerd craft and stuff, it's just going to be some massive builds and everything like
2076540	2077540	before.
2077540	2080700	So, but yeah, just been playing Minecraft.
2080700	2081700	Awesome.
2081700	2086740	It sounds like you've, uh, had a lot of, uh, good, good times and good memories being made
2086740	2087740	there.
2087740	2089260	I need to, I need to dabble back in Minecraft.
2089700	2090700	It keeps up.
2090700	2091700	One 18 is amazing.
2091700	2092700	Yeah.
2092700	2098380	You need to play one 18 because it's just, you know, it's all sorts of craziness.
2098380	2103060	My schedule and gaming suddenly freed up with my inability to play Final Fantasy 14.
2103060	2106180	And I finished that no man's sky expedition to transition to my gaming week.
2106180	2108940	I finished the no man's sky expedition, the redo.
2108940	2110460	So I got my golden Starship.
2110460	2111740	So did Alan, by the way.
2111740	2113100	So applause for us both.
2113100	2116100	Um, but the no man's sky, I did two and three.
2116100	2117400	I don't need to do those again.
2117400	2118400	So I have nothing to do.
2118400	2120400	No man's sky till the end of the month.
2120400	2124720	And then Alan and I might start a multiplayer thing, uh, and maybe stream a little bit of
2124720	2125720	it, but we'll see.
2125720	2129920	But anyway, I might do Minecraft just to scratch the itch of the crafting stuff.
2129920	2133800	Cause you know, there's a lot of that in no man's sky is like a lot of Minecraft really
2133800	2138840	check out one 18, just like pop in a server and just check it out because like the caves
2138840	2144000	and everything are completely different before there's like very like, it's just really big
2144000	2147840	vistas and like, everything's kind of like, wow, it's like for the first time type stuff,
2147840	2151680	you know, they kind of get that, you know, first time playing Minecraft feeling again.
2151680	2153240	That's pretty fun.
2153240	2155160	I'm getting into other stuff for my gaming week.
2155160	2156160	I'm Marissa.
2156160	2157160	My cell is in chat.
2157160	2158160	Hi.
2158160	2162080	Saying my gaming week was sending Rob all my Pikmin bloom postcards because no one else
2162080	2163080	I know plays.
2163080	2164880	I have been seeing them, Marissa.
2164880	2165880	Hello.
2165880	2166880	Thank you for being here.
2166880	2167880	And uh, thank you for that.
2167880	2168880	I appreciate.
2168880	2172720	I wish I could send you as many back, but because my friend, you know, the Niantic friends
2172720	2173920	list cross pop it.
2173920	2178760	So if you add somebody in Pokemon go, they're automatically in Pikmin and, uh, with, uh,
2178760	2182360	you know, well, you don't have friends in Ingress, but they, they go back and forth.
2182360	2186840	So I actually have quite a few friends that are addicted to Niantic games like myself
2186840	2188520	because I met them playing Ingress.
2188520	2192200	So, um, I have quite a few people I have to set postcards to, but I always try to make
2192200	2195520	sure I send Marissa at least one or two cute ones from my week.
2195520	2197120	So, um, hope you've been enjoying those.
2197120	2201160	I will say I have continued to play a lot of Pikmin bloom, um, with everything I've
2201160	2205000	talked about in my own personal life over the last month, we're trying to be more active
2205000	2209360	and when I'm eating and all that stuff, I I've been doing pretty good on my walking.
2209360	2212000	Um, and Pikmin bloom has been a huge motivator for that.
2212000	2216840	I got to say, I hit level 29 today after a little, a little hike around.
2216840	2222320	I did a three mile walk today, uh, around one of the parks here and, uh, my Pikmin hit
2222320	2223320	level 29.
2223320	2224320	So that was pretty cool.
2224320	2230680	So, um, Oh, Marissa says I play on private property, so I'm probably encouraging trespassing.
2230680	2235320	How did you get a thing on your private property that you're not supposed to have that?
2235320	2236320	Just so you know.
2236320	2242160	So lucky you, um, let's see, I want to come visit now cause there's probably a portal
2242160	2243160	in there.
2243160	2244160	That's really hard to get.
2244160	2248240	Uh, anyway, um, so, uh, what else for my gaming week?
2248240	2250440	So honestly, no man's sky.
2250440	2254840	We talked about the final fantasy 14 Pikmin, honestly, guys, that really just leaves a
2254840	2256680	little bit of debt by daylight.
2256680	2261320	And, uh, I've just been trying to level up, uh, Jonah, cause I really wanted his ability,
2261320	2266480	the new, the new survivor, because I really wanted his ability, um, to, for, for my other
2266480	2267480	characters.
2267480	2269640	I got his level 30 ability, which is the one I wanted.
2269640	2275720	And then I saw as much as wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you mean, uh, non bleach tips,
2275720	2276720	Guy fairy?
2276720	2277720	Yes.
2277720	2278720	Yes.
2278720	2284120	And as loud as he is, he's loud, but they get, well, a, I always run iron will anyway,
2284120	2288440	but B they gave him a skin that he wears a flat cap.
2288440	2289440	Like I do.
2289440	2290760	And like a little polo shirt.
2290760	2293560	I was like, Oh, I kind of love CIA guy.
2293560	2294560	Yeah, I know.
2294560	2300800	But, but I think it's good that we're having more, uh, of course Latino characters.
2300800	2301800	Yes.
2301800	2303600	And so freaking love Carmina.
2303600	2304600	Oh yeah.
2304600	2306720	Anyway, no, it's fine.
2306720	2310640	I brought it up, but I, it was a part of my week and I did some slightly different things.
2310640	2313160	So that's really it for my gaming week.
2313200	2317200	Um, yeah, uh, try to, I'll try to do some more streaming next week.
2317200	2322600	Uh, I I'm sorry, I never streamed Final Fantasy 14, but because of all the issues going on,
2322600	2324080	I think you can understand why.
2324080	2326440	And my sound tearing was pretty bad anyway.
2326440	2328480	I don't think it would have made for a great stream.
2328480	2333880	So there's that, uh, before we get into other news, Marissa, another comment in chat says
2333880	2338280	Pikmin bloom for me is just a more engaging step counter.
2338280	2340480	That's actually kind of what I like about it.
2340480	2346680	Is that it, um, uh, it's a lot more simple than ingress or Pokemon go.
2346680	2349100	It's a more set it and forget it kind of game.
2349100	2350880	And I, that's actually kind of what I like about it.
2350880	2356160	It makes it easier to multitask and play that game while you're doing other stuff, um, out
2356160	2357160	around the world.
2357160	2361520	Um, as to show 100 mountain chats has been playing forza horizon five when I can.
2361520	2362520	Yeah.
2362520	2364760	That's, that's what I need to do and go back and pick up those games.
2364760	2369020	I've really dropped cold Turkey because they keep stacking on top of each other.
2369020	2373260	Like all these game releases I want to play, I need to play more forza horizon five.
2373260	2377180	I dropped, um, Pokemon, uh, brilliant diamond shining pro.
2377180	2378860	I brought, I dropped diamond.
2378860	2383180	Like I barely touched it since that first weekend I played it and I need to remedy that
2383180	2384180	too.
2384180	2388020	Although I'm kind of waiting for like the home connection to be in there.
2388020	2390700	Cause then I can do the collection challenge and all that stuff.
2390700	2395060	So yeah, I didn't play Pokemon shield until like a year after it was out.
2395060	2398140	So I'll probably just be a little while before I go back and visit.
2398260	2402260	All right, we're going to get into some more news, just so you know, for scheduling purposes.
2402260	2405840	Uh, I know the holidays are coming up and a lot of shows are going to be off towards
2405840	2406840	the end of the month.
2406840	2411740	Um, honestly, the way the days fall this year in years past, there's been a show on the
2411740	2414300	25th or on new year's eve or something.
2414300	2417740	So we haven't really been able to do them, but the way things fall this year, we have
2417740	2423260	a show on January 2nd and a show on December 26th.
2423260	2425580	So we should be here for those shows.
2426100	2429820	Dark soccer may be off on the 2nd of January, but Loki and I will hold down the fort if
2429820	2431780	that's the case, uh, that night.
2431780	2435980	So, uh, we, we will still be or given you content through the next few weeks.
2435980	2440620	So please enjoy that much content I'm sure, but yeah, we'll, we'll see.
2440620	2445340	We might have to, uh, figure out, maybe invite a guest or try to get some evergreen content
2445340	2446340	somehow.
2446340	2447340	We'll talk about that.
2447340	2448340	That's for sure.
2448340	2449840	Hopefully catch up on our gaming backlogs.
2449840	2452420	So there shouldn't be any shows off for a little bit.
2452460	2456820	There probably will be a week or two off early next year, uh, for some reasons that I'll
2456820	2462420	get into in a future episode of the show, uh, for meantime, let's get into some gaming
2462420	2464580	news and some of the other headlines.
2464580	2468460	I guess I alluded to this one earlier, Loki, why don't you start off with this?
2468460	2476020	Uh, yeah, so, um, basically it's more Activision drama.
2476020	2481500	So Activision Blizzard King where the government officials are pressuring, um, the Activision
2481500	2486300	Blizzard guys again, because of, you know, stuff not actually happening.
2486300	2492320	And, um, basically now it's starting to affect the, or they're threatening their company's
2492320	2494020	profits as well.
2494020	2498860	So it's as we're concerned, the current CEO and board of directors don't have the skillset
2498860	2503480	nor the conviction to Institute these sweeping changes needed to transform their culture
2503480	2508300	to a source for us with the employees and the shareholders and the partners.
2508300	2515340	Um, apparently they have formed a workplace responsibility committee, but you know, we,
2515340	2518820	as we mentioned last week or the joke I made last week was yes, they formed the committee
2518820	2523420	to investigate themselves and they'll find no wrongdoing whatsoever.
2523420	2529180	Um, but basically they're trying to get the, uh, little public pressure as well, you know,
2529180	2533260	kind of going to the shareholders to try to push pressure on them.
2533260	2538260	And it, I think it has affected them a little bit monetarily, but I don't know if it's like
2538260	2543700	I think it was just temporary, didn't really seem to be like a big, um, hit in their stock
2543700	2545580	prices or anything like that.
2545580	2546580	Right.
2546580	2548900	Um, and then can I give a little more background here?
2548900	2553820	Just because I want to make sure with the, which government officials are upset and why
2553820	2557660	this is different from the criminal investigation happening in California.
2557660	2562140	What you have here is you have a series of States, um, where the treasures of the States
2562140	2565900	have basically come together to say, this is a problem at ABK.
2565900	2566900	Why?
2566900	2572740	Because you may or may not realize this, a lot of state money gets invested, um, in the
2572740	2574780	stock market, just like some of your money.
2574780	2580220	Um, because that is how a lot of States pay for like pension plans, uh, and pay for, um,
2580220	2582140	a lot of different elements of the state.
2582140	2587020	Uh, the money may be invested so that, you know, just like for why a private citizen
2587020	2589780	would do it, you want to try to make more money.
2589780	2595540	So the problem is because of these issues at ABK and the way the stock is going down,
2595540	2601140	maybe it's not having a huge impact on investments now, but these treasures are speaking up because
2601140	2606500	like whoa, whoa, this now this is starting to affect our money that goes into.
2606500	2615620	So basically the most capably vocal state, uh, shareholders that could possibly speak
2615620	2618820	up government officials are speaking up.
2618820	2620020	That's the long and short of it.
2620020	2622460	So I just, I just kind of want to explain that a little bit because I think it's easy
2622460	2625220	to say, Oh, the government's mad at ABK again.
2625220	2628500	But this is a little different because this isn't a criminal investigation.
2628500	2633200	This is right now it's impacting your money, which is what, again, the CEO is supposed
2633200	2635620	to be in charge of making sure it doesn't happen.
2635620	2636620	So sorry, Loki.
2636620	2637620	I just want to clarify.
2637620	2639140	No, no, that makes sense.
2639140	2644020	And yeah, I mean, maybe they're not necessarily great investment right now.
2644020	2649340	Um, but don't worry, they're going to turn those stock prices right around with the technique
2649340	2653260	that they've used in the past, which is, Hey, we're making lots of money, so let's lay off
2653260	2654680	some more employees.
2654680	2661160	So they've, uh, the QA testers for call of duty are now facing layoffs after being promised
2661160	2663520	raises back division.
2663520	2670520	So um, Raven software, uh, the contractors there were told that they would face layoffs
2670520	2673400	starting January 28th of next year.
2673400	2677580	Um, because apparently they are done QA testing the game.
2677580	2679580	It's good enough, I guess.
2679580	2680580	Right.
2680580	2682360	Um, this is disgusting.
2682360	2688500	Like, and you know, I, I'm sure there is a, you know, well, Rob, if you wanted to look
2688500	2692520	at this realistically, these layoffs were probably starting to be planned three months
2692520	2695800	ago before a lot of this started to come out and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2695800	2702700	I don't give a fuck because this last year, it's too late off like 800 people.
2702700	2704440	It's disgusting.
2704440	2709020	Like I understand people get laid off from businesses that are not profitable sometimes,
2709020	2712380	but it's disgusting to watch the board take home the money that they do.
2712380	2716860	I understand Bobby Kotick cut his salary on paper, but we all know he's still making money.
2716860	2720700	It's disgusting that there's still profits going to the wrong places.
2720700	2724780	And these people, it's that that's the frustrating part.
2724780	2729620	You're watching these hardworking people, the people that most deserve money and don't
2729620	2733700	deserve any of this shit that everybody's throwing at ABK right now.
2733700	2737720	We were, we're trying to be that protective person, trying to dodge them from the arrows
2737720	2740460	and the gunfire that are going around on the internet.
2740460	2744920	These are the people we're trying to protect, the hard frontline workers and to see them
2744920	2750280	get laid off when Bobby Kotick keeps his job and the board keeps his job, it is fucking
2750280	2751920	frustrating.
2751920	2757160	So frustrating, like beyond the capacity for words.
2757160	2759240	Yeah, for sure.
2759240	2760240	Anyway.
2760240	2766920	Um, if that's all you have to say about that, I have another ABK related story, which this
2766920	2768680	is all I have to say.
2768680	2773140	This is all under that umbrella of we're still going to talk about the business and these
2773140	2776160	news types of things here on the show.
2776160	2781020	And this has to do with some of the fallout when it comes to the Game Awards.
2781020	2786360	So a question came up this week about how my Activision Blizzard be involved at the
2786360	2788480	2021 Game Awards.
2788480	2794480	And I don't know, there was a Washington Post article where they kind of interviewed Jeff
2794480	2800160	Keeley and this whole thing happened where, you know, there's, and then Kotaku kind of
2800160	2801160	did a hit piece.
2801160	2802360	Like, I don't, I don't know what else to call it.
2802360	2809220	They kind of did a hit piece where they were like, Jeff Keeley refuses to, uh, say that,
2809220	2813440	you know, he's not going to have Activision Blizzard involved with the show and all this
2813440	2814440	stuff.
2814440	2817240	And again, I think Jeff has a difficult line to walk here.
2817240	2818240	I really do.
2818240	2823300	Because again, there is a part of the Game Awards where we want to acknowledge the developers
2823340	2828780	and the people that work hard on the games, even when the antics of the publisher is what's
2828780	2830060	driving us bonkers.
2830060	2832060	And that's exactly what's happening here.
2832060	2835260	It's Activision that we're pissed off at, Bobby Kotick and all this stuff.
2835260	2838800	You know, the people that develop the games, that's not the people we're mad at.
2838800	2841700	And so I can understand where Jeff is trying to shift the conversation there.
2841700	2845400	Now, other people take issue with, well, look who's on the board.
2845400	2850180	You have the president of Activision who's on the board, which a board of advisors for
2850180	2854900	the Game Awards, which by the way, if y'all on social media before you click retweet would
2854900	2858980	do a little fucking research, sorry, cause this, this does annoy me.
2858980	2860980	It's not Bobby Kotick.
2860980	2863620	It's Robert Kosich or something like that.
2863620	2867860	It is a different individual who is the president of Activision.
2867860	2871060	I may be ignorant and I will be the first to say it.
2871060	2876700	I am not aware of this individual being connected to any of the sexual harassment bullshit and
2876700	2878220	all this stuff that's going on.
2878260	2881620	I, and I may just be unaware and I'm willing to own that.
2881620	2885260	If this individual is tied to that, then it, it sucks and all that.
2885260	2888400	And one could argue he is the president of Activision.
2888400	2890060	The onus should be on him to that extent.
2890060	2892100	I will agree with you on that.
2892100	2895020	Then maybe for that reason, there is no place for him on the board.
2895020	2900860	However, did you not fucking notice before you click that retweet button, Yves Gilman
2900860	2907260	is also on the board from Ubisoft and don't we have quite a few same problems going on
2907260	2908260	over there.
2908260	2909260	Yep.
2909260	2913660	It's a boys club is what it is.
2913660	2921140	To Jeff's credit, I do notice there are several women and other folks that are in that panel.
2921140	2924500	And it doesn't feel token to me, but I'm not on that board.
2924500	2926400	It does feel like there are more than one.
2926400	2931620	There are a few and so forth, but the most problematic of the guys are on it.
2931620	2932620	Oh sure.
2932620	2933620	Sure.
2933620	2935740	I'm not, I'm not going to excuse that.
2935740	2940440	And SJ 100 Matt is kind of piping in saying all Jeff said was that he is still navigating
2940440	2944620	how to handle the issue and Kotaku spurred it into something different with its headline
2944620	2945620	and article.
2945620	2949660	And I agree that Kotaku really framed this in a negative way that a lot of people ran
2949660	2950660	with.
2950660	2954560	And I think, I don't think it was appropriate to be quite honest.
2954560	2962500	But I do understand to a point the industry needs to say something and Jeff is kind of
2962500	2964620	representing the industry this week.
2964620	2968580	But I hope you all are very aware the industry is saying something.
2968580	2975340	Did you not hear what Microsoft said, Nintendo said, Sony said, and now the governments of
2975340	2980620	several states are saying in regards to their investment, the pressure is mounting on Bobby
2980620	2981620	Kotick.
2981620	2982620	It will crack.
2982620	2988440	And if there's a miracle, we'll get one before the year's end, I hope, but we'll see.
2988440	2994920	But I do think that piece was a bit inappropriate on Kotaku's part, quite honestly.
2994920	2998880	There are elements of it I understand, and I even go so far as to agree with.
2998880	3004960	I think basically saying to him, because you have not clearly said no Activision Blizzard
3004960	3010820	at all in my show, you are endorsing all of this behavior, I think that was a shit position
3010820	3011820	to put him in.
3011820	3013180	I do.
3013180	3017240	Because I think Jeff is in it for the folks on the front lines as well.
3017240	3020860	And you see that in the types of stuff that he tries to acknowledge and sprinkles out
3020860	3023880	throughout his show and all that stuff.
3023880	3029480	Long story short, after that article came out, Jeff Keighley did write a series of tweets
3029480	3035220	that said Activision Blizzard will not be involved with the show outside of their nominations
3035220	3036720	and potential wins.
3036720	3041060	So if they win something, they still get to go on stage and accept the award.
3041060	3049180	But in my humble opinion, the gaming press, if Activision Blizzard should win an award,
3049180	3054820	will not hesitate to comment about these problematic issues with Bobby Kotek in the same breath
3054820	3056140	as the award.
3056140	3060220	Which is unfortunate for the developers, but is probably what should happen.
3060220	3065260	We need to be reminded that there are problems that still need fixing at Activision Blizzard.
3065260	3067420	It should totally be a big call out.
3067420	3068420	Absolutely.
3068420	3069420	So.
3069660	3072380	But I don't envy Jeff Keighley in this position.
3072380	3076340	He's like, can't we just celebrate game developers and games and all this stuff?
3076340	3078580	And you know, I kind of get it.
3078580	3082320	S.J.O. and Hunter Matt in chat says, it wasn't a good look, but Jeff is listening and has
3082320	3083420	a history of listening.
3083420	3086660	His statement later that night was the best he could do in that situation.
3086660	3092380	And Mike Deff says, I think the only two ABK games there are Call of Duty, and I'm pretty
3092380	3093740	sure it won't win.
3093740	3095180	I don't think it'll win either.
3095180	3096380	I don't think it will either.
3096380	3098180	So I don't think, I think this is all going to be for naught.
3098180	3100140	It's all of the polish that they're putting in.
3100140	3101140	Yeah.
3101140	3102140	Yeah.
3102140	3104780	Anyway, speaking of the game world, look, there is much more going on to the game awards
3104780	3106820	than just this stuff.
3106820	3108740	We're going to get some game reveals.
3108740	3109800	Jeff has been teasing.
3109800	3112320	There's one he's been working on for like two years.
3112320	3113900	People are jumping to conclusions.
3113900	3117660	It's a Breath of the Wild sequel reveal.
3117660	3123120	I don't want to jump to that conclusion, but I understand why people are leaping there.
3123120	3125780	And Jeff does have a history of working pretty well in Nintendo.
3125780	3129620	So we might, we might see something pretty exciting there at the game awards.
3129620	3131940	But regardless, we're going to see some exciting stuff there.
3131940	3134380	It's pretty much winter E3 coming up this week.
3134380	3139860	So I do want to say here at VOG Network, at least Bobby and myself and Jamie and Loki
3139860	3144380	are welcome if they can make it certainly, we're going to be co-streaming the game awards
3144380	3147520	Thursday night starting at 4.15 Pacific.
3147520	3152100	It's going to be a long night because there's a pre-show at 4.30 Pacific, 7.30 Eastern.
3152100	3155860	And then I think the awards themselves are at least two hours, maybe even three.
3155860	3157360	So it's going to be a long night.
3157360	3158860	Do we know how long the awards are Bobby?
3158860	3159860	Are they three hours?
3159860	3161620	I think it might be a long show.
3161620	3164720	So we're going to be busy Thursday, but we will be co-streaming it here.
3164720	3168620	So if you want to, and you know, we try to keep it positive and, and give our reactions
3168620	3170980	and gasps to trailers and things like that.
3170980	3173780	It'll be like watching it with friends in a pandemic safe way.
3173780	3178900	So we'll be here to do that for you guys Thursday here at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
3178900	3179900	Yeah.
3179900	3183900	SJ 100 Matt says, I can see a few acceptance speeches be interesting.
3183900	3185180	Me too.
3185180	3188440	And I think that is going to be the interesting thing in all of this.
3188440	3193380	It's going to be interesting to see a little bit of that Oscar political speech crossover
3193380	3194380	to the game awards.
3194380	3197940	They kind of, kind of, I don't even know if I would call it political, but just workers'
3197940	3198940	rights.
3198940	3199940	I think it kind of needs to.
3199940	3202140	So it'd be very interesting to see what comes of that.
3202140	3203940	So let's watch it together on Thursday.
3203940	3204940	All right.
3204980	3208660	Bobby says, wow, scheduled to go until eight o'clock Pacific.
3208660	3210180	All right.
3210180	3213560	That's longer than an episode of this show, but we'll do it three and a half hours on
3213560	3214560	Thursday.
3214560	3215560	Hope you'll join us.
3215560	3217940	No Man's Sky trailers.
3217940	3218940	Sign me up.
3218940	3220500	I fucking love No Man's Sky.
3220500	3224780	I fail to see the problem, Loki.
3224780	3228800	Now if it's more Deathloop trailers, actually that game is pretty good from what I understand.
3228800	3230980	So I need to, I need to stop harassing that.
3230980	3232420	It may even win the game of the year.
3232420	3233420	So we'll see.
3233420	3234420	All right.
3235420	3236420	Let's move on.
3236420	3240540	We have more news going on and I think this one we're going to throw over to Jamie.
3240540	3248020	So it looks like PlayStation, there's going to be some plans from Sony to hopefully take
3248020	3252420	over what's going on with Xbox Game Pass, at least give them some solid competition
3252420	3253740	for it.
3253740	3258480	The code name for this service is called Spartacus and it's going to let PlayStation owners pay
3258480	3263420	a monthly fee for access to a catalog of modern and classic games.
3264420	3269160	They apparently were said by people who were not authorized to speak to the press.
3269160	3272740	So we have some NDA breakage possibly.
3272740	3281800	They said that it's going to be available on PS4 and PS5 and quite possibly in the next
3281800	3282800	few months.
3282800	3286520	And they're also thinking about having a free monthly titles.
3286520	3288880	This was actually stated by Bloomberg.
3288880	3291260	So it's a pretty big service.
3291260	3295460	So that's enough for me to give it some merit.
3295460	3296460	Yeah.
3296460	3301020	Jason, I forget his last name, Shear, I think it is with Bloomberg.
3301020	3302780	Sorry if I mispronounced the last name.
3302780	3308260	He's been on top of a lot of stuff lately with the ABK stuff, especially too.
3308260	3311560	So his Twitter feed's been pretty fascinating follow lately.
3311560	3316220	So I think when Bloomberg and he's stepping up to report this, I think this is one of
3316220	3319020	those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things for sure.
3319020	3324480	Not to say things can't change as I think happened with the Switch Pro.
3324480	3326420	But I think it's definitely a smoke, there's fire.
3326420	3329700	And of course, Sony has to compete with Game Pass, right?
3329700	3335580	Like we kind of saw that whole like PlayStation 4, what is it, 20 games available on PS5 and
3335580	3336580	all that.
3336580	3338560	That was kind of like the first step in that.
3338560	3344500	So I think this makes a lot of sense and marrying it to PlayStation Plus and making it all one
3344500	3345500	pro.
3345500	3349340	PlayStation now I don't think is having the type of numbers Sony probably wants.
3349340	3353820	I think trying to put that all in one package, even if it's multi-tiered, which is a little
3353820	3356940	weird, but I guess it's working for Nintendo.
3356940	3359380	I think it has the potential to work out.
3359380	3363980	I think a lot of people just want to know, is it going to be all cloud gaming or do I
3363980	3367300	actually get to download PS2 and PS1 games and play them?
3367300	3370460	It'll be interesting to see how that works out because I think there's still a lot
3370460	3373300	of resistance to cloud gaming because of bandwidth caps.
3373300	3375620	And believe me, I understand.
3375620	3379620	But with PS1 games, I bet it's probably not going to be as bad as you think.
3379620	3383760	Because like Antstream, when I was playing that, you know, that's all cloud gaming.
3383760	3385620	It was like nothing on my bandwidth.
3385620	3386620	It really wasn't.
3386620	3387620	It was probably as much bandwidth.
3387620	3390620	I mean the games themselves aren't that big anyways, so yeah, I can imagine that'd
3390620	3391620	be pretty decent.
3391620	3392620	We'll see.
3392620	3394300	But well, but can the hardware run them?
3394300	3399940	I would be shocked if a PlayStation 5 can't run PS1 and PS2 games.
3399940	3403620	PS3, I get, gets a little dicey, it's a little newer, it was different, you know, but...
3403620	3405020	He's gonna do that now though.
3405020	3406020	I know.
3406020	3407020	I don't know.
3407020	3408020	I know.
3408020	3409020	I have a hard time believing that.
3409020	3413580	SD100Matt in chat says, I hate the idea of a tiered system as a consumer.
3413580	3415220	Just give me a flat rate with everything.
3415220	3420120	I see that, but it'll be interesting to see what all they include.
3420120	3425980	I think a point that the media has not been bringing up enough in regards to this story
3425980	3431500	that I want to remind people of, Sony, and I've said this on the show before, and I think
3431500	3438460	we've seen Sony do a little bit of this, Sony has arms and extensions of their company in
3438460	3442620	other areas that could really sweeten this pot.
3442620	3446380	You know, if they are gonna go to a three tiered program and that third tier has games
3446380	3453660	and all that stuff too, why wouldn't that third tier have Crunchyroll, Sony movies,
3453660	3457620	Sony music, and some of these other things as well?
3457620	3465060	What if a high tiered pass was beyond just PlayStation and it was gaming and entertainment
3465060	3466060	and whatever else too?
3466060	3467060	I'm done with that.
3467060	3471020	It's impossible to get any of the Sony movies on any streaming service aside from Voodoo
3471020	3473100	and you have to rent that stuff, so no thanks.
3473100	3476320	And that's why I think Sony should really be looking at that.
3476320	3482700	If they're gonna talk a multi-tiered system, then go the, I guess the Apple all-in-one
3482740	3488660	route where you can get Apple Fitness separately, you can get Apple TV separately and all that,
3488660	3491180	but they also have that pass that has everything.
3491180	3492180	That would be a smart route.
3492180	3495540	I think that would be a smart model for Sony to copy, but that's just my opinion.
3495540	3496540	We'll see what they do.
3496540	3497540	So.
3497540	3500700	Um, Dartasuya in chat says, oh, that's a good point, Rob.
3500700	3501700	Thank you.
3501700	3503680	I try my best on this program and please keep inflating my ego.
3503680	3506220	It drives me to do this show more and more.
3506220	3507220	Thank you for the reassurance.
3507220	3508220	I appreciate that.
3508220	3509220	All right.
3509740	3513300	Watch my ego swell live on Twitch.
3513300	3518180	I need to get a bigger hat and just keep switching hats throughout the show as Dartasuya and
3518180	3522260	other kind chatters inflate my ego and I just switch into the bigger hats as the show goes
3522260	3523260	on.
3523260	3524260	All right.
3524260	3526740	It'll look like the Kentucky Derby before we're done.
3526740	3527740	All right.
3527740	3529860	Moving on to our next story.
3529860	3530860	Loki.
3530860	3531860	It was kind of cool.
3531860	3535620	They're doing this whole, uh, Winter Games Fest thing through Xbox.
3535620	3538820	It's going to be a bunch of the independent developers at Xbox.
3538820	3542780	Um, they're going to have like a bunch of game demos out.
3542780	3546460	So they have a small list of the games that are out right now.
3546460	3549860	Um, not a lot of these are recognized because they are independent games, but like Death
3549860	3555480	Trash, Loot River, The Tale of Biston, Black Tail and Nobody Saves a World.
3555480	3560300	And those are supposed to be available, um, from December 7th through the 21st.
3560300	3561860	You can check out those demos.
3561860	3569140	They're coming to the Xbox One series and, uh, I think also PC as well, but it's pretty
3569140	3575020	cool to see some of these, um, kind of like almost like E3 style demos being put up at
3575020	3576020	one time.
3576020	3577020	I know they've done this in the past.
3577020	3578020	It looks pretty cool.
3578020	3579020	Yeah.
3579020	3580020	I like that.
3580020	3581020	We're kind of getting all this stuff in the winter time.
3581020	3584180	Like, uh, you know, off cycle E3 type of thing.
3584180	3586980	So yeah, I like that.
3586980	3587980	Yeah.
3587980	3588980	Uh, yeah.
3588980	3590900	So I'm, I'm excited to check some of this stuff out.
3590940	3594220	We know Xbox has their own cloud things set up too that I'm sure they can deliver some
3594220	3595220	of this through.
3595220	3596220	So it'd be interesting.
3596220	3597220	Yeah.
3597220	3598220	All right.
3598220	3604020	Um, y'all know I play way too many AR games from Niantic, um, including Pokemon Go and
3604020	3605020	Ingress.
3605020	3609620	And I even tried that Harry Potter game for a hot minute, but it's going away anyway.
3609620	3614380	But what could the future of Niantic look like besides, Oh, what Transformers and not
3614380	3617460	Catan, but whatever else they, what else have they announced that they haven't come out
3617460	3618460	with yet?
3618460	3619460	There was another one.
3619460	3621220	I don't remember the moment.
3621220	3622220	Transformers was one.
3622220	3623220	Yeah.
3623220	3624220	Maybe it was Pikmin.
3624220	3625820	And I just, I'm looping that in cause there was three games.
3625820	3626820	Yeah.
3626820	3627820	I think it's Pikmin.
3627820	3630220	I was like trying to think if there's another one on top of Pikmin, but I'm sure there's
3630220	3631220	more.
3631220	3634300	Well, you've seen things like when they're advertising their own metaverse, right?
3634300	3639500	Cause now, and this is like it or not, this is going to become more and more of a conversation
3639500	3643080	in this decade because this is what everybody's kind of buying into, at least on the corporate
3643080	3648240	level is this metaverse type of thing, which metaverse going to be the new blockchain thing.
3648240	3649240	I hope not.
3649720	3653960	You know, I don't know when Niantic talks about it, I get it.
3653960	3659760	When Facebook talks about it, I'm guarded like that's, that's, that's, that's the reality
3659760	3661020	of the situation.
3661020	3664600	But there's, there's been conversation about how other tech companies are kind of going
3664600	3665600	to this place too.
3665600	3668820	But anyway, I don't want to just talk about meta, but I do want to talk about a very interesting
3668820	3671500	purchase that Niantic made, made this week.
3671500	3676040	And that is a gameplay recording app called low key.
3676040	3684240	Not to be confused with a co-host here on orange lounge radio, this is L O W K E Y.
3684240	3692560	So low key, um, so low key, the, uh, app that Niantic bought, uh, low key was designed with
3692560	3697060	like casual games in mind or people that don't really want to sit there and edit their videos.
3697060	3701680	What the app does, it captures videos on the computer and syncs them with the phone.
3701680	3706360	And then on the phone, you can use very basic, simple editing tools to make short clips for
3706360	3707760	mobile viewing.
3707760	3711860	That's actually kind, I never knew about this app, but that is, I can actually see the place
3711860	3716200	for that with people wanting to get on Instagram and TikTok and all like moving that from the
3716200	3719560	computer to get on TikTok actually makes a lot of sense to me.
3719560	3722680	So it sounds like that's the type of thing that low key is trying to do.
3722680	3726620	Um, so, um, Niantic has purchased low key.
3726620	3731160	Now they didn't say what low key is going to be involved with, but the quote leadership
3731160	3738560	in the space will accelerate the social experiences Niantic is building in its products.
3738560	3744760	We share a common vision for building community around shared experiences and enabling new
3744760	3747960	ways to connect and play for our explorers.
3747960	3752260	Let me tell you a true story in the Niantic world for a minute.
3752260	3757060	So one of my really good friends, uh, one of my favorite people in my life, uh, John,
3757060	3762160	my old roommate who may have cameoed on this show once or twice when we were at the house.
3762160	3767300	Do y'all remember when we were on Justin TV, long time OLR people, and we were in that
3767300	3770600	garage that would get really cold in the winter, but it was insulated.
3770600	3771900	It's not super cold.
3771900	3774820	And we had like the Christmas lights and actually looked like a studio in there.
3774820	3777340	That was the house I lived out with John.
3777340	3779460	John got super into Pokemon Go.
3779460	3784300	Um, and I kept nagging him to try Ingress and eventually he finally cried.
3784300	3788140	Like there was a slow period in Pokemon Go and he played Ingress and he fell in love
3788140	3790140	with it and he really enjoyed it.
3790140	3793380	And he's still playing it and he's actually even playing it today.
3793380	3800860	And uh, he actually sent me a text today and he said, I hiked up Mount San Miguel just
3800860	3804780	to farm keys for a potential, I guess I shouldn't be giving strategy away, oops.
3804780	3808820	But he did a big hike today for reasons, wink nudge.
3808820	3812400	And he actually, and this is going to be very hard to see on the Twitch feed, but you can
3812400	3815840	all can see I've been sent a panoramic picture.
3815840	3821040	He sent me a picture from the top of the mountain where this video game inspired him to go hike
3821040	3822580	and go exploring at.
3822580	3824020	That's awesome.
3824020	3828900	And then he sent me another picture if I can see it here, hold on, cause I'm going to try
3828900	3830180	to put this up onto it.
3830180	3836160	Then he sent me a picture of his dirty pants that got covered in dirt from the walk.
3836160	3841180	And I think my response was Ingress, Oh, the places you'll go and shoes you'll ruin in
3841180	3842500	the process.
3842500	3845520	So, but anyway, this is my point.
3845520	3849540	So I didn't just tell you all that to read a cute text message exchange about Niantic.
3849540	3854640	The key part in there was he sent me a picture from the top of this mountain that he probably
3854640	3856680	wouldn't have gone to otherwise.
3856680	3863260	And I bet you if John Henke, CEO of Niantic heard that story, he would smile and say,
3863260	3866500	yes, exactly.
3866500	3870060	And I think that is what this is.
3870060	3873980	This is going to be because if Niantic is building themselves out as like real world
3873980	3878540	exploration and they always push this stuff, like take pictures with your Pikmin interacting
3878540	3879540	in the real world.
3879540	3882980	But then when community day and stuff rolls around, they like to highlight here's photos
3882980	3887900	of people gathering and playing and walking and being active and they love to push that
3887900	3888900	stuff.
3888900	3893180	I think they really want to take that to the next level with some of this like social sharing
3893180	3894180	stuff.
3894180	3897960	And whether it's, they're going to build it into the apps to like make you able to do
3897960	3902240	TikTok videos more easily, or they want to build their own network or something.
3902240	3906320	I'm not sure what's in the cards for that right now.
3906320	3915560	But I think that is the direction and definitely Niantic's vision for all this stuff.
3915560	3919400	Mere Muse in chat says, oh, the places you'll go and the mud you'll find.
3919400	3921120	Yes, that is true.
3921120	3924080	Mike Defton chat says, all according to plan.
3924080	3928280	John Hanke, most look, most likely an accurate quote.
3928280	3932980	Quest Buster in chat says Niantic jonesing for a piece of the metaverse pie.
3932980	3935480	They've already said they are going.
3935480	3939040	If you watch that whole thing about light ship, which we got into a couple of weeks
3939040	3942860	ago on the show, they said they're going for the metaverse.
3942860	3946840	It's just Niantic's metaverse is AR.
3946840	3950640	And I think most of Facebook, because I'm not calling him by the name they want me to
3950640	3954840	Facebook's universe, I think is mostly hinged in VR.
3954840	3957320	But I think there are AR elements to it.
3957320	3960060	I think Facebook kind of wants to do everything.
3960060	3961200	But Niantic's made it very clear.
3961200	3965520	And that's why I'm I'm kind of excited to see Niantic of all people competing with Facebook,
3965520	3968320	because I know who I'm rooting for in that situation.
3968320	3974780	S2100 Matt says, honestly, I'm shocked they haven't let folks buy clothes to customize
3974780	3978720	all of their Pokemon and go, oh, wait, just you wait.
3978800	3983320	Zen Monkey 11 says the goal is probably world domination, like always in a way.
3983320	3986060	I mean, businesses do exist to make money.
3986060	3988480	That's the society we live in.
3988480	3990120	But Pokemon Go is an example.
3990120	3991120	They're doing a pretty good job.
3991120	3994320	I don't know how well Pikmin's doing, but I think it's doing all right.
3994320	3998280	It seems to be high up in the download chart of, you know, I don't think the game has to
3998280	4002560	be the runaway success that Pokemon Go was to be successful, but we'll see.
4002560	4006400	So anyway, we'll see what develops of this low key purchase.
4006680	4011480	Every time I hear Niantic getting into social, I'm so curious what they're developing on
4011480	4015060	the back end, because I know they're starting to build this friends list and everything
4015060	4017320	is coming together in that regard.
4017320	4021520	By the way, before I toss it over to Jamie and her story, I did want to give one tiny
4021520	4025000	update on Niantic's biggest game, Pokemon Go.
4025000	4029120	If you were not already aware, they released a pretty major update on iOS.
4029120	4034460	It didn't change anything about the game mechanics, but for a while now, Android has been running
4034460	4039580	at 60 frames a second and the iPhone version, for whatever reason, I don't know, hasn't
4039580	4040580	been.
4040580	4045820	This new version, you can go into advanced settings and you can now unlock and run the
4045820	4047480	game at higher frame rates.
4047480	4052220	It's probably at the cost of battery, but I get pretty good battery out of my, you know,
4052220	4053220	iPhone.
4053220	4054220	I don't even know what iPhone I have.
4054220	4055220	I think it's an 11.
4055220	4057360	I still get pretty good battery life out of that.
4057360	4059200	And I got to say, the game looks really good.
4059200	4061500	Like when you have the unlocked frame rate, it's so smooth.
4061500	4062500	It's butter.
4062500	4063500	It's like butter.
4063540	4069060	Um, and by the way, that feature is also on the Android version for not just 60 frames
4069060	4070740	a second, but unlocked.
4070740	4072580	So you can do that if you want.
4072580	4075820	So anyway, uh, I think it's really, I think it looks really good.
4075820	4079620	I don't know why it's in advanced settings, but again, my, my assumption is it's tied
4079620	4080900	to battery life.
4080900	4086040	Um, so yeah, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I was going to ask how that new update
4086040	4087040	looked for you, Rob.
4087040	4088040	It looks good.
4088040	4092460	Well, I mean, Alan has Android because we're, we're a bi-phonal household, uh, and, uh,
4092460	4095780	Alan is, so I've seen the, the Pokemon at 60 frames a second.
4095780	4097700	I was, I was like, oh, that does look really good.
4097700	4099540	I wonder why they won't do all right.
4099540	4101240	It took them time, but they finally got it over.
4101240	4103180	So hooray.
4103180	4107020	And Mike Def says, yeah, I've heard of people having their battery drain a lot quicker.
4107020	4111740	So yeah, I would, I would say play in short bursts or don't turn that feature on or, you
4111740	4115340	know, hook it up to a battery charger or whatever.
4115340	4116340	All right.
4116340	4117340	Sorry, Jamie.
4117340	4119340	I just wanted to make sure that important update got out there.
4119340	4121340	So what do you have for us?
4121380	4128740	So, um, there has been another leak, um, because leaks, leaks are going to leak, right?
4128740	4131900	Um, it's been linked, uh, linked, oh my gosh.
4131900	4132900	I can make words happen.
4132900	4133900	I promise.
4133900	4143260	Um, Bioshock force setting and it's time period, um, actually it was shared by a journalist
4143260	4150260	named Colin Moriarty, um, who was saying that was going to take place in the 1960s in an
4150260	4152780	Antarctic city.
4152780	4158020	And um, it also has matched what other sources have said.
4158020	4161940	So it could be very, very accurate.
4161940	4164260	It's supposed to be in a city called Borealis.
4164260	4171740	Um, the game's code name is Parkside and, uh, basically this, yeah, it's like I said,
4171740	4173340	it's just matching up with what other people have said.
4173340	4177540	So we can see if it's right or not when the game comes out.
4177540	4179580	I'm glad to hear another Bioshock is on the way.
4179580	4183820	Like I know, I know there's been rumblings, but it's been, it's been a long time since
4183820	4185220	we've had a Bioshock game.
4185220	4189060	Bioshock Infinite is pretty aged.
4189060	4192500	I think Bioshock Infinite can almost be a classic game of the week at this point.
4192500	4195780	Maybe it's not that that old, but it's, it's close.
4195780	4197780	It was a PS3 game, right?
4197780	4198780	Yes.
4198780	4203820	So yeah, it's, uh, uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, feels like now's a good time for a Bioshock
4203820	4204820	game.
4204820	4205820	Yeah, I think so.
4205820	4209100	Uh, Questbuster in chat says a city at the foot of the mountains of madness.
4209140	4211140	I just want to know how they're going to out twist all the other games.
4211140	4212140	It'd be exciting.
4212140	4214820	I want to know where the mountains of madness are so I never go there.
4214820	4215820	All right.
4215820	4222220	Uh, just a few more stories and then we have the last flag here on orange lounge radio.
4222220	4225580	If you don't know what I'm talking about, cause you were a newer listener, I'll explain
4225580	4226860	in just a few more stories.
4226860	4228420	Yeah, no, we'll explain.
4228420	4229420	We'll explain to me.
4229420	4230420	All right.
4230420	4231420	Uh, but first Loki.
4231420	4232420	So yeah.
4232420	4239580	So, um, Fortnite's completed their chapter two and part of that did kind of leak out.
4239580	4246100	So they did this big finale, um, with a, I guess, cameo of the rock.
4246100	4248820	Um, I can't remember the character he was playing.
4248820	4250300	He's leader of the seven, I guess.
4250300	4255020	Um, and I always get that confused because the seven is the name of the superhero group
4255020	4257980	and um, the boys.
4257980	4259740	So that's also confusing.
4259740	4267140	Um, but anyway, so he made a cameo in that and basically the whole island that you play
4267140	4273380	on flipped upside down and that is basically opening it up for season three, which then
4273380	4277300	the trailer leaf for that as well before to this whole event happened, but then they finally
4277300	4279240	released the official trailer.
4279240	4285180	So some of the new things coming to season or chapter three, um, is that they're going
4285180	4287180	to have Spiderman in there as well.
4287780	4293540	Um, you can do web slinging and they are going to have, uh, these, I guess, tents that you
4293540	4298500	can get or basically can kind of store your cache of weapons that you get through the
4298500	4299500	different games.
4299500	4302700	And you'll be able to take that with you into other games.
4302700	4304620	Um, what else?
4304620	4305620	Oh, and sliding.
4305620	4308880	They've added sliding as well, but it looks interesting.
4308880	4310620	What about Kelly Clarkson?
4310620	4312300	Can't they add Kelly Clarkson to the game?
4312300	4313940	I mean, they probably could.
4313940	4318700	They gave us Ariana Grande and like, what, why have you, have you seen all the videos
4318700	4322080	of them duetting and stuff around the internet because of the voice and that stuff.
4322080	4324500	If we have Ariana Grande, we need to have Kelly Clarkson.
4324500	4328180	Like it's just, it's just Kelly Clarkson.
4328180	4331140	Anybody can be in, in this game now.
4331140	4332460	I mean, pretty much everything.
4332460	4333460	Oh.
4333460	4336540	And, uh, aside from experiment, they're also going to have the Gears worst characters in
4336540	4337540	there as well.
4337540	4342100	Uh, that was something else that was shown off in the trailer because why not?
4342100	4343100	Yeah.
4343100	4344100	Yeah.
4344100	4346380	So it's, it's interesting.
4346380	4348660	When are they going to rename the game pop culture orgy?
4348660	4352100	Cause that's, that's what they're really going for with this and their, their own version
4352100	4354220	of the metaverse, I suppose.
4354220	4355220	Interesting.
4355220	4356820	I don't know.
4356820	4357820	All right.
4357820	4362180	Well, going over to a, another story here that has to do with, I think, I think one
4362180	4366300	of dark Sakura's favorite, um, gaming, uh, franchises, so I don't know why I'm talking
4366300	4367300	about it, but that's all right.
4367300	4368900	I'll get, I'll get Jamie's reaction to it.
4368900	4370260	I did not know this.
4370260	4376740	Apparently December 4th is dragon age for day because December and four D four.
4376740	4378540	So December 4th is dragon age day.
4378540	4379540	That's a stretch.
4379540	4383260	It's a stretch, but you know how like end seven, November 7th is mass effect day.
4383260	4386660	I guess they've decided to December or December 4th is dragon age day.
4386660	4389220	And we did get some updates on dragon age.
4389220	4393660	No, we didn't get new trailer or anything like that, but there were some short stories.
4393660	4397420	There was a story about gray wardens, which made me think of Jamie and her cosplay.
4397420	4401660	And there was a one about necromancers that they put up and they also have said the following
4401660	4406700	about dragon age for speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore.
4406700	4410460	We want to let you all know that we're still hard at work on building the next single player
4410460	4412740	focused experience for dragon age.
4412740	4416420	We're excited for next year when we can talk more about what we're working on and what
4416420	4420420	a lot of people are looking at in that statement is, Oh yay.
4420420	4421740	Single player focused.
4421740	4424140	They're not going to try to shove multiplayer into it.
4424140	4427380	Like bio areas had to do with a lot of other games now.
4427380	4431140	I don't know, like the multiplayer in mass effect three, I thought it was really underrated
4431140	4432500	and super fun.
4432500	4436740	I'm not sure I really liked it in dragon age inquisition and got kind of old.
4436740	4438060	It was fun to do a couple of times.
4438060	4442260	I don't know if Jamie, you felt any differently, but I, I, I kind of felt it got old and even
4442260	4443260	bother.
4443260	4444260	Yeah.
4444260	4447420	So how do you feel when you hear that they're focusing on single player?
4447420	4448420	Makes me excited.
4448420	4453860	I'm like, why didn't they from the beginning, uh, pressure from EA would be the answer to
4453860	4454860	that.
4454860	4455900	However, here's something interesting.
4455900	4457300	This is what rumors say.
4457300	4463040	So read into this, what you will, but apparently dragon age four was going to be multiplayer
4463040	4472460	focused like Anthem was headed in that direction, but then Anthem came out and flop arena'd.
4472460	4478980	But not only that star Wars, Jedi fallen order, a single player experience game came out and
4478980	4480660	did very well.
4480660	4484460	So the rumor is EA backed off the multiplayer thing.
4484460	4489660	And so Bioware is now focusing on single player, much to the rejoicing of many dragon age fans
4489660	4490660	everywhere.
4490660	4492300	So it was not rejoicing.
4492300	4493300	Yay.
4493300	4498020	Hey, look, I'm fine with dragon age, having a multiplayer thing, have it a separate game.
4498020	4502660	This is this, they just have it a separate thing that comes out that I would, I would
4502660	4506340	really, really, really love nothing more than a new mass effect multiplayer game to come
4506340	4508960	out to like bridge bridges.
4508960	4510380	Just do a multiplayer only game.
4510380	4515100	I would be so into it if it was like, even, I didn't hate Andromeda's multiplayer.
4515100	4519300	It wasn't as good as threes, but I liked it enough.
4519300	4520520	I'd be into it.
4520520	4528660	So anyway, I'm, I'm perfectly happy with, with just having there being some sort of
4528660	4530500	separate thing if they were going to do it.
4530500	4532340	I mean, that's just how I feel about it.
4532340	4533340	Yeah, I agree.
4533340	4534340	I agree.
4534340	4537680	Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says they have a fucking day for everything now.
4537680	4538780	Just call it every day day.
4538780	4539780	Yeah.
4540180	4542900	I think this one was a little bit of a stretch, but there you go.
4542900	4543900	All right.
4543900	4548060	Um, let's get to our last segment here that Jamie's going to introduce and something very
4548060	4549380	special about tonight.
4549380	4565140	Uh, but first I'm going to roll this bumper and now it's time to travel back to a simpler
4565140	4570540	time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4570540	4578540	It's time for the classic game of the week, but here in the calendar year, 2021 dark soccer
4578540	4584000	once a month picks a fucking weird arcade game to spotlight.
4584000	4588100	And I think she's got one of the best of all here as the last pick.
4588100	4592220	So once a month, the classic flag fucking weird arcade game of the month, dark soccer,
4592220	4593220	what did you pick?
4593900	4596060	I picked prop cycle.
4596060	4597060	Of course.
4597060	4598060	Nice.
4598060	4602180	It's fucking weird, but it's great in the best way, in the best way.
4602180	4603180	Oh, totally.
4603180	4604180	No.
4604180	4605180	Prop cycle is great.
4605180	4611420	Um, prop cycle came out when I was working at a Namco arcade and I have a lot of fond
4611420	4613060	memories of it.
4613060	4620300	So in a nutshell, what this is, it is a 3d game with a focus on flying except you're
4620300	4625220	not flying a plane or a jet or even a hoverboard.
4625220	4627700	You are on a bicycle with wings.
4627700	4629980	Well, in the game it has wings.
4629980	4639540	So basically what you're doing is you are on this bike and you are doing your thing.
4639540	4645500	You're moving along and you have to pop these bubbles and go through a balloon, sorry, and
4645500	4647540	go through these wings and everything.
4647540	4653100	You're in this world that's like post this huge war.
4653100	4660500	It was this hyperspace magnetic thing called the Tesla bomb was used in war and it destroyed
4660500	4667860	everything and it changed the world's terrain and then technology is now fueled by natural
4667860	4668860	resources.
4668860	4674180	This game has like this whole like backstory and shit to it that's honestly pretty crazy.
4674180	4677460	I had no idea this game had a story.
4677460	4678460	Right?
4678460	4688540	But you're going around on this flying thing called the laparopter.
4688540	4695340	And so this one town, someone like did this thing with another thing.
4695340	4700500	I know it's like, how did this happen?
4700500	4708220	And it ended up that you have to go in and find these energy balls and save the world
4708220	4711460	again against this event from happening.
4711460	4716220	And so that's where you are with it.
4716220	4721980	You're having to go through and save the world by popping balloons.
4721980	4733060	And the prop cycle itself has, it really was considered to be one of the more original
4733060	4734060	things that came out.
4734060	4736700	A lot of people went, fuck is this?
4736700	4741340	And part of the development team, it was also, I mean, they went out hand gliding to develop
4741340	4745860	the mechanics of the game.
4745860	4753180	And they were also inspired by part of Kiki's delivery service with the flying on the balloon.
4753180	4757620	And they want to convey the sense of writing on the wind.
4757620	4763420	So they have like a fan that blows on some of this.
4763420	4765600	I don't know if they had it in all of them.
4765600	4767820	Every single one that I have played has had it.
4767820	4768820	Really?
4768820	4769820	Hmm.
4769820	4773500	But they might've had some without.
4773500	4783460	And they did actually add some different things in the plot to make it more appealing to people.
4783460	4787780	And they were going to put a sightseeing mode in the game where you could just fly wherever
4787780	4791500	you want, where you had a time limit, you could just fly around, but they scrapped that
4791500	4793280	from there.
4793280	4799620	It was considered the second most popular arcade game of August, 1996 in Japan.
4799620	4804580	And certainly one of the most unique games that came out at that time.
4804580	4809660	Now, the prop cycle has also played a part in pinball.
4809660	4812020	Yes, in pinball.
4812020	4817460	And I'm sure people who know and have seen this know exactly what the hell I'm talking
4817460	4818460	about.
4818460	4823580	Yes, I am talking about Prop Cycle Adam's family.
4823580	4829140	Prop Cycle has been hooked up.
4829140	4837540	The cycle itself has been hooked up to an Adam's family pinball.
4837540	4842020	And you play pinball while riding the prop cycle.
4842020	4849940	And the prop cycle fuels the power of the machines that you can keep playing.
4849940	4853060	Of course, trying not to tilt on that sucker is hard as fuck.
4853060	4854900	But I digress.
4854900	4860260	It actually is, I would say, pretty, pretty fun.
4860260	4865060	Pretty fun to play and, you know, one of those very interesting things.
4865060	4878860	I think that it's, what I'm thinking for it, it's one of those things that you would have
4878860	4884820	to see to believe and play even more to go, excuse me, what.
4884820	4887020	It sounds, excuse me, what, already.
4887020	4891660	Well, I mean, it is already what, but it's even more what.
4891660	4894980	It's pretty interesting.
4894980	4899740	And there's people who have these machines in their home, there's, I mean, I know that
4899740	4904580	the people have done some homebrew stuff, I couldn't find any, but it really is just,
4904580	4909660	you know, neat and whimsical.
4909660	4914340	And it was a workout, trust me, when I was playing this, it was like, it was my workout.
4914340	4918700	It was my exercise bike when I worked at my arcade.
4918700	4921220	And the music is great.
4921220	4926940	You know, it still is a game that holds up today as far as I think.
4926940	4928260	So there you go.
4928260	4929260	Prop cycle.
4929260	4930260	Hurray.
4930260	4931860	Love this game.
4932140	4937220	I'm sorry, I may have missed this, but was there ever a home version of this?
4937220	4938940	Did they try?
4938940	4941660	I do not see that there was a home version.
4941660	4943820	Um, nope.
4943820	4947340	I mean, it would be hard because you can't exactly hook up an exercise bike and play
4947340	4950860	it or anything like that, but you would have, like, this is a game I would have totally
4950860	4951860	seen on the Dreamcast.
4951860	4953540	You know what I mean?
4953540	4954540	It did not.
4954540	4956780	It did not have one.
4956780	4960220	On top of that, though, by the way, since I didn't mention it, it was on the M.C.O.'s
4960220	4964100	Super System 22.
4964100	4969080	And other games that were out on this, because this will definitely put it in the time frame,
4969080	4980340	we had Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Time Crisis, Alpine Racer series, Aqua Jet.
4980340	4981340	What else was there?
4981340	4984060	Yeah, I said Alpine Racer, didn't I?
4984060	4985060	Yeah.
4985060	4987140	So that era of games.
4988140	4990460	That's great.
4990460	4991460	And that's it.
4991460	4992460	All right.
4992460	4993460	Mm hmm.
4993460	4994460	So there it is.
4994460	4995460	The last flag.
4995460	5000500	And I don't have the wiki in front of me, I guess I should pull that up so we can recap
5000500	5001500	for the year.
5001500	5005260	But that is going to be the last fucking weird arcade game.
5005260	5007460	I can get the wiki up.
5007460	5008460	I'm working on it, too.
5008460	5009460	So it'll be a race.
5009460	5010460	I've got it up right now.
5010460	5011460	Okay.
5011460	5015020	So to recap for us, please, the 12 flags of 2021.
5015900	5027740	Boonga Boonga, Tsukomi Yosei Gip's Nice Tsukomi, Ino no Osanpo, Cho Chabudai Gaishi, The Last
5027740	5038260	Bar Fighter, Stinky Feet, Sonic Blast Man, Final Furlong, Sega Toilet, The Typing of
5038260	5041100	the Dead, and now Prop Cycle.
5041100	5042100	There it is.
5042100	5043100	That was a good collection.
5043100	5044100	Congratulations.
5044180	5045180	Congratulations.
5045180	5050940	Now I need people to message me to suggest what I'm going to be, what the crap I'm doing
5050940	5053780	next month, because I have not next month, but next year, because I have no freaking
5053780	5054780	idea.
5054780	5055780	All right.
5055780	5061620	So send you send your suggestions for the 2022 twist at Dark Sakura on Twitter.
5061620	5063420	Jamie's been doing this for a few years now, right?
5063420	5066020	Like the first year was what was it?
5066020	5067020	Peripherals.
5067020	5068020	I think it was the first year.
5068020	5069020	Right.
5069020	5070020	Because of the DDR mat and stuff.
5070020	5071020	You forced.
5071020	5072020	Actually, no, it was not.
5072020	5073020	It was system.
5073020	5078940	It was the console of that was it system peripherals and peripherals and then a classic
5078940	5079940	eight soundtrack.
5079940	5080940	Okay.
5080940	5081940	And then classic pinball.
5081940	5082940	Oh, yeah.
5082940	5085940	And then the flag.
5085940	5086940	Wow.
5086940	5089900	So this was the fifth year of a twist.
5089900	5091180	What a twist.
5091180	5092180	We need more twisties.
5092180	5093180	I know.
5093180	5095180	Pretty sure the twist will need twists.
5095180	5096460	All right.
5096460	5097780	Um, love that.
5097780	5098780	All right.
5098780	5099780	But not chameleon twist.
5099780	5100780	All right.
5100780	5104300	But don't worry if you're if you don't like twists.
5104300	5108180	The other weeks out of the month, three or four, depending on how many shows we have
5108180	5113100	and how long the month is, end up being good old fashioned classic games and more and more
5113100	5117980	classic games become eligible every day, because really the only rule is that it should be
5117980	5118980	a game.
5118980	5122200	I guess there's been a rare exception to this, but for the most part, it needs to be a game
5122200	5125740	10 years older or more to be eligible for the classic game.
5125740	5130160	And way too many times on this show, we have ended up talking about games that we covered
5130160	5134120	when they were new.
5134120	5135280	Now they're having games.
5135280	5136280	I know.
5136280	5137280	I know.
5137280	5138280	But 10 years is a long time.
5138280	5139800	All right.
5139800	5143300	Let's travel around the world quickly and check out some other news happening in gaming
5143300	5144600	with some rapid fire news.
5144600	5147840	And I think we're going to start with Loki.
5147840	5148840	Yep.
5148840	5154280	Um, so we've got some wonderful stuff coming out.
5154280	5160760	Starting with, uh, the battlefield 2042 players being mad at, well, EA.
5160760	5165080	And the reason for that is because they put out some Santa skins.
5165080	5170960	So the reason why they're mad is because typically this kind of goofy stuff is more along the
5170960	5177800	lines of what Call of Duty does and, you know, battlefield 2042, which was a hot mess as
5177800	5183860	it was when it came out is now selling these ridiculous Santa skins in their sort of realistic
5183860	5189260	somewhat realistic, you know, military shooter game.
5189260	5192500	And so people just threw a big old fit about it.
5192500	5197800	And I mean, they had like all sorts of like Fanta skins for their tanks and the helicopters
5197800	5199880	and stuff like that.
5199880	5205200	But because of the backlash, they decided to go ahead and pull those skins.
5205200	5211300	So they're not going to be selling them after all, uh, people.
5211300	5212300	It's a war on Christmas.
5212740	5214140	No, I don't think it's a war on Christmas.
5214140	5217340	It's more of just that, like this game is a buggy mess.
5217340	5219100	No, it's a Christmas on war.
5219100	5220100	Absolutely.
5220100	5221100	I'm playable.
5221100	5227140	And you're pushing, you're pushing DLC or like in-game purchases for this game that
5227140	5229140	it's not worth the money as it is.
5229140	5233100	So that I think is that the fact that it's just stupid.
5233100	5236540	I was making, making a joke though, I get it.
5236540	5239020	I think, I think we need to check in everybody.
5239420	5246860	Could somebody visit the website gamershateeverything.com and let me know, do gamers still hate everything?
5246860	5249420	Could someone visit the website and let me know?
5249420	5252020	I hate everything and I'm a gamer.
5252020	5259020	And then, um, so PlayStation Plus, we've got stuff coming out here for, um, I guess starting
5259020	5260400	in December.
5260400	5267700	So they've got Lego DC Super-Villains on PlayStation 4, Mortal Shell on PlayStation 4 and Godfall
5267740	5273460	Challenger Edition on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is like your PlayStation 5 game.
5273460	5278900	The reason why people are upset about this is because Godfall Challenger Edition is basically
5278900	5286900	just three end game level modes called Lightbringer, Dreamstones and Ascending Tower of Trials.
5286900	5294020	Um, apparently it's like a glorified demo to the game, but you can pay to upgrade it
5294020	5295580	to the full game if you want.
5295820	5300100	So now, now they're just saying, you know, instead of the free PlayStation 5 game, it's,
5300100	5301260	oh, yeah, free demo.
5303500	5308540	Cool, looking forward to that brand new PlayStation Games Pass service.
5308540	5312620	And on this story, this is one of the things where, yes, gamers still hate everything and
5312620	5313780	I'm right there with them.
5313780	5316300	This is, this is a stupid sale.
5316300	5317140	It's fine.
5317140	5320020	Like even if I had a PlayStation 5, I wouldn't want to play Godfall anyways.
5320020	5323460	It doesn't look like a very good game and I don't think the reviews were too kind to it.
5323460	5325780	So whatever.
5325780	5329460	There's a lot of games that come out on these services that are not great.
5329460	5332740	I mean, it is what it is, but yeah, the Godfall.
5332740	5338500	Why not just, I think that's the point is that the entire retail game was nothing that
5338500	5341780	great if the critics are to be taken at face value.
5341780	5344580	So why, why not just give us the fucking game?
5344580	5348580	Like, don't give us this like bullshit extended trial or whatever it is.
5348580	5349860	Give us the whole game.
5349860	5352260	God, Dark Soccer.
5352260	5352980	What do you have?
5353060	5353940	Maybe some better news?
5354740	5355860	Um, maybe.
5355860	5362580	Um, so the next, uh, thing that's going to be on Nintendo 64 for Switch Online coming
5362580	5366740	out on December 10th is, uh, Paper Mario.
5367540	5371220	And it's going to be on there with their, uh, online expansion pack.
5372500	5375380	And, uh, it'll be really, really fun.
5375380	5377140	Paper Mario was a really good one.
5377140	5384340	Um, but, uh, we also know what else is coming as Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Kirby 64, Mario
5384340	5387300	Golf, Pokemon Snap, and Majora's Mask.
5387940	5390020	So yay.
5390020	5392420	I'm glad that, uh, I've got the upgrade.
5393300	5396020	And glad they're going nice and slow and adding those games.
5397540	5399220	Well, but they're adding quality.
5400660	5405940	And then, um, then there's a new, uh, crossover going on for, uh, Virtua Fighter,
5405940	5407220	Five Ultimate Showdown.
5407220	5411140	We are going to have, um, Yakuza characters in Virtua Fighter.
5411780	5415620	And I still don't care for Virtua Fighter, but Yakuza characters are going to be pretty fun.
5416260	5417380	So cool.
5418500	5419000	Yep.
5419780	5420980	I think it's a fun crossover.
5421860	5422420	Indeed it is.
5423140	5426660	Dark Tetsuya in chat about the Paper Mario on Switch Online says,
5426660	5428980	sadly, I think that's it for NSO in December.
5428980	5435380	As far as I know, you mean Nintendo abandoned the non-expansion pack stuff already?
5436260	5437060	LeGasp.
5439540	5441460	I mean, color me shocked people.
5441460	5443220	I'm so surprised.
5443220	5445220	Look at my surprise face.
5445220	5445720	Exactly.
5446500	5447000	All right.
5447700	5448820	Let's travel around the world.
5448820	5450500	Do you have to hate everything?
5450500	5451060	Yes.
5451060	5451700	Do you have to?
5452260	5454980	Did you go to the website gamershateeverything.com?
5454980	5456580	It says right there.
5456580	5457140	Yes.
5457140	5458420	You have to let it linger.
5458420	5461060	And it even says it in Comic Sans just for you.
5461060	5461560	All right.
5462340	5462840	Rob.
5463860	5464180	What?
5464180	5464740	Do you have to?
5466900	5468180	Um, let's move on.
5468180	5470660	We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates,
5470660	5475700	some things that, um, are coming out, um, that you can buy new games instead of emulated ones.
5476260	5481060	So let's get, can you guys hear Mr. Smoosh playing with his new toy before we get to this?
5481700	5481860	Okay.
5481860	5482660	Thank God.
5482660	5486980	Because although I'm not, I don't hear him through our microphone, but yeah.
5486980	5487300	Okay.
5487300	5492740	So Alan bought him a new toy at the Bougie pet store that we have to get his food at.
5492740	5495940	Cause our, our cat won't settle for meow mix.
5495940	5497700	He has to have the nicest stuff.
5497700	5501220	So Alan decided to get him a new toy and it's a little squeaky toy.
5501220	5504420	So it's a little mouse that you chase around and go squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
5504420	5505620	Well, that's great.
5505620	5507940	Except like, it'll be like dead silence.
5507940	5509780	Like I'm sitting there on the computer.
5509780	5512180	Alan has his headphones on the room's completely silent.
5512180	5515060	And then from the hallway, I just hear squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
5515060	5517140	It's like this little squeaky mouse going off.
5517140	5518420	And now I'm hearing it during the show.
5518420	5519860	He's over there playing with it, which is fine.
5519860	5521220	I want Mr. Smoosh to be entertained.
5521220	5523060	I think it's funny, but yeah.
5523060	5525460	Anyway, I just don't want to come through on air.
5525460	5526420	Cause it sounds a little weird.
5527060	5527380	All right.
5527940	5529380	Let's get to release dates.
5529380	5531060	We'll start with the U S Loki.
5531860	5532100	Yes.
5532100	5535300	So we have Final Fantasy 14 and Walker coming out on PC,
5535300	5537220	Mac PlayStation, PlayStation five.
5539940	5543860	Spell force three reinforced on PC.
5544580	5548660	Halo infinite on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series X.
5549460	5554260	Uh, loop hero on Nintendo switch, uh, monster hunt or I'm sorry.
5554260	5556660	Monster rancher one and two deep Lux.
5557540	5560420	Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch and iOS.
5561140	5561700	And that's it.
5562980	5563460	All right.
5564340	5566820	Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.
5567380	5571780	Um, on the Nintendo switch this week, we have Valise.
5571780	5575300	The Phantasm soldier collection is out on December the ninth.
5575300	5577540	Monster rancher one and two DX.
5577540	5581700	It's a 25th anniversary box limited edition also out in Japan this week.
5581700	5584420	Uh, and, uh, let's see fit boxing too.
5585060	5586820	Uh, that comes with a special joy con attachment.
5586820	5588180	I guess it's a boxing thing.
5588180	5589380	Uh, also out this week.
5590020	5593300	YouTubers life too is actually getting released in Japan.
5593300	5595860	I watched a friend of mine play this on Twitch a little bit.
5595860	5597540	Uh, it looks really silly.
5597540	5597780	Yeah.
5597780	5600420	It's I, but it does say it is an English.
5601060	5604180	It doesn't look like they've done anything to localize it for Japan,
5604180	5606740	but it is being released, uh, physically on the switch over there.
5606740	5608180	So I thought that was interesting.
5608180	5613300	Um, Alba a wildlife adventure also on Japan, uh, Sakuna of rice and ruin.
5613300	5615380	That game came out, uh, about a year ago, I think,
5615380	5616980	but it is now getting a price reduction.
5616980	5621060	So it re-released with that as it moves into best price collection,
5621060	5622900	uh, on the switch this week in Japan.
5623860	5628020	Monopoly and monopoly madness also out in Japan this week.
5628020	5631780	Um, that's a lot of releases for switch, but that's what we've got.
5631780	5636100	Let me peek at the PlayStation five real quick to see if anything is out there.
5636100	5638420	Um, dying light to stay human.
5638420	5640420	That is out on PlayStation five this week.
5640420	5643380	So I guess that's kind of a worldwide thing this week.
5643380	5646100	And then quickly peeking at the PlayStation four.
5646100	5650980	Um, we have, uh, some of the same stuff like YouTubers life too,
5650980	5652740	is actually also out on PS four.
5652740	5658020	Uh, the crisis remastered trilogy is also out this week on PS four,
5658020	5661380	uh, that same Sakuna of rice and ruin also on PlayStation four.
5661380	5664820	Monopoly plus monopoly madness, all that good stuff also there as well.
5664820	5669860	And, um, street fighter five championship edition, all character pack.
5669860	5673620	So if you want to have the Uber version of that, that is getting
5673620	5676340	a type of retail re-release in Japan this week.
5676340	5677620	How about the UK dark Sakura?
5678660	5681460	In the UK, we have actually just come out.
5681460	5682420	We have never song.
5683220	5688580	We have on the seventh gear club, uh, unlimited to ultimate addition.
5689220	5693140	We have on the seventh as well, gang beasts for switch.
5693940	5700260	Um, beyond a steel sky steel book edition on the eighth, we have halo infinite, um,
5700260	5705220	on the ninth monopoly madness on the 10th, the eternal cylinder for Xbox.
5705780	5706580	And that's it for the week.
5707540	5708040	All right.
5708820	5709060	Sure.
5709060	5712340	The year's going to wind down pretty soon here with the releases.
5713140	5716740	Um, but then it'll pick right back up, uh, early next year, uh, with, uh,
5716740	5719300	all the stuff they've got to get out before the end of the financial year.
5719860	5720420	All right.
5720420	5721140	For sure.
5721140	5722500	Just a few more stories for you guys.
5722500	5725700	And then we'll open it up to emails and your calls maybe.
5725700	5729060	And all that good stuff, uh, with our listener round table, but first,
5729060	5731220	Oh, I'm sure Loki had to talk about this.
5731220	5732260	This is too funny, right?
5732260	5732660	Loki.
5733220	5733620	Yeah.
5733620	5738500	So all these convenient glitches and bugs that we have in some of the new
5738500	5742420	Nintendo games are yes, it's hilarious.
5742420	5749620	So we've got an animal crossing, uh, new horizons, uh, DLC issue.
5749620	5755300	So the happy home paradise DLC is causing some of the characters
5755300	5756660	clothes not to appear.
5756660	5761780	So they're walking around naked in the game, or at least without clothes.
5762500	5764580	Um, Hey, you know what?
5764580	5765620	They just want to be free.
5766260	5768900	They just want to, they just want to live the way they came into the world.
5768900	5769400	Come on.
5770260	5772740	There's going to probably be doing some updates to fix that.
5772740	5776820	So, um, Nintendo, you think, I think.
5777380	5781380	And then apparently, uh, Brit Pokemon, brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.
5781380	5783460	They have a glitch to one year.
5783460	5786180	Um, what was it you're doing?
5786180	5790020	Like the surf technique or something like that on the water that it makes it
5790020	5793140	look like that the Pokemon are mounting each other.
5793140	5798420	So that's something else that's probably going to have to be patched as well.
5799700	5800200	Wow.
5801060	5801560	Yeah.
5802340	5803300	Only Nintendo.
5803300	5807300	They can't be bothered to put new stuff on Nintendo switch online for the, uh,
5807300	5810740	lower tier users, but they're going to make catch up, put some goddamn
5810740	5812100	clothes on, on that Island.
5812100	5813140	That's for sure.
5813140	5818020	They know sex sells, you know, got to entice the new players.
5820340	5820840	All right.
5821300	5825700	Well, actually a series that, uh, we've talked about a lot that is on the switch,
5825700	5828820	uh, is expanding, uh, to new platforms this week.
5828820	5834420	Uh, ACA or the arcade archives has some releases that are coming out on iOS and
5834420	5835220	Android.
5835220	5840260	This is notable because this is AKA Neo Geo specifically, and this is its first
5840260	5841140	foray than I think.
5841140	5845780	I think arcade archives may already be on, um, uh, iOS, Android, but Neo Geo,
5845780	5848660	uh, this is the first releases that we're seeing on mobiles.
5848660	5853940	So we have alpha mission two metal slug five and samurai showdown four.
5853940	5855460	I'm acoustic revenge.
5855460	5859620	So if any of those are titles that you, uh, recall from the Neo Geo days or just
5859620	5865300	things you want to check out, they are available on iOS and Android for 3 99.
5865300	5866500	So four bucks.
5866500	5871940	Um, this series was previously only PlayStation four, Xbox one, windows 10 and
5871940	5872740	switch.
5872740	5875300	Um, so they are apparently now available.
5875300	5877460	So you can check that out if you want.
5877460	5880100	Um, which I know metal slug and samurai showdown.
5880100	5881940	I don't remember alpha mission two.
5882900	5885380	Probably if I watched it in motion, I I'd remember it.
5886740	5888500	These are some later Neo Geo games.
5888500	5889140	So it's interesting.
5889140	5891060	They're kind of starting here, but that's pretty cool.
5891060	5895380	Uh, you can do a virtual pad customization, uh, and all this stuff.
5895380	5899620	They have online rankings and button settings and yeah, all that good stuff.
5899620	5905780	So fun to see that, uh, come out to the phones be very interesting if they do get
5905780	5910900	into a console archives place later, as was that rumor, uh, a few weeks ago that
5911380	5912580	we talked about here on the show.
5912580	5913940	I would love to see them get into that.
5913940	5914580	That's for sure.
5915220	5916180	Um, Dar Sakura.
5917860	5923460	So, um, we have a release of Shin Megami Tensei five.
5923460	5924660	It is out.
5924660	5929460	There is an update, um, that has camera angles and brightness adjustment
5929460	5930500	available to it.
5930500	5934180	Um, it also helps you adjust the field of view.
5934980	5942100	You, uh, can, uh, change, uh, uh, you actually reduces the number of gimmicks
5942100	5944660	for jumps after the lay line in a certain area.
5944660	5946820	They just basically did some general bug fixes.
5947460	5953140	And, uh, really the, the depth of view on there is actually pretty intense.
5953140	5957140	Looking at some of these, uh, differences as are the brightness effects.
5957140	5958260	It's actually really cool.
5958820	5959540	So there you go.
5959540	5960500	You can go ahead and get it.
5961060	5961700	Yep.
5961780	5965300	I have some friends that have been playing the game and, and, uh, really enjoying it.
5965300	5969460	So it's one of those series that, you know, if I had more time, I'd make,
5969460	5972980	but these games are like a long time to beat if I'm not mistaken.
5972980	5974580	So it's just one of those games.
5974580	5978420	I just haven't gotten around to yet, but someday, someday, uh, Loki.
5979700	5980420	All right.
5980420	5987140	Um, so let's talk about, I, I really hate take two sometimes.
5987140	5994260	Um, but so take two is now coming after, um, the publisher of the game.
5994260	5998340	It takes two, which was that kind of, uh, I don't know.
5998340	6002820	It was like sort of a cute, like co-op puzzle game that they had.
6002820	6008580	Um, and I think this came out a while ago, but now they're just coming after him because,
6008580	6013300	you know, the name, the trademark for the name sounds too close.
6014180	6019700	Um, apparently though, uh, yeah, I don't know.
6019700	6024580	I think the haze light said that it can't comment on ongoing disputes,
6024580	6026500	but hopefully that it will be resolved.
6027300	6028340	I hope they drop this.
6028340	6029140	This is ridiculous.
6029140	6032500	I get it that you have to protect your trademarks and stuff like that, but there's
6032500	6036980	no confusion between take two, the publisher and it takes two.
6036980	6041220	This is, this is definitely an overreach and is definitely just, uh, somebody being a little
6041220	6045060	bit too trigger happy about the whole, if you don't defend your trademark, you lose
6045060	6045780	it type of thing.
6045780	6049540	So, um, very silly, very, very silly.
6049540	6052100	Um, and hopefully they settle it quickly.
6052100	6057060	So, um, S2100 Matt says, I really hope take two wins just out of spite.
6057060	6058020	Why would you say that?
6059700	6062580	Or are you just, are you making a joke because they're both named take two?
6062580	6063060	I don't know.
6064660	6065860	I don't want to take two to win.
6065860	6067060	I want it takes two to win.
6068020	6072820	Um, yeah, it takes two should win and then they lose their trademark for take two.
6072820	6073700	That'd be funny.
6073700	6074020	Yeah.
6074020	6075540	Oh, that would be funny.
6075540	6080340	Um, Oh, S2100 Matt says, I mean, wins game of the year at the game awards.
6080340	6081540	Oh, okay.
6081540	6082260	That would be funny.
6082260	6082500	Okay.
6082500	6083140	I'm with you there.
6084020	6086260	Um, that'll be interesting.
6086260	6087140	Uh, yeah.
6087140	6091300	Orange right in chat says Rob base and DJ easy rock, not available for comment.
6091300	6093060	I see what you did there for what it's worth.
6094180	6096260	All right, moving on.
6096820	6099460	It takes two to make Sue somebody, right?
6100740	6102580	It takes two to really start a fight.
6102580	6103300	All right.
6103300	6107860	Um, now I'm going to get sued.
6107860	6108180	All right.
6109300	6111060	As I probably deserve it.
6111060	6111460	All right.
6111460	6115780	Um, moving on to, uh, one more story here.
6115780	6118340	Uh, you guys are too much.
6118340	6118900	I'm sorry.
6118900	6124020	I have to read this comment from Sia Tabiri who says, but how did the Olson twins who
6124020	6124980	starred in the movie?
6124980	6127540	It takes to feel about the situation.
6128580	6130820	Oh, for fuck's sake.
6130820	6131780	My reaction.
6131780	6132500	Exactly.
6134660	6138900	I'm sorry, but I'm giving Sia Tabiri the gold star comment of the night award.
6138900	6140260	Congratulations.
6142100	6143780	You win 50 internets.
6143780	6144100	Yes.
6144100	6145460	You win points.
6145460	6148020	You win internet points worth nothing.
6148020	6148500	You know what?
6148500	6154580	I have some Travis Donovan space bucks that fell from his station when, um, he, uh, closed
6154580	6155620	under station life.
6155620	6158100	So I have some Travis Donovan fun bucks for you.
6158100	6159620	Sia Tabiri, please enjoy.
6160980	6161460	All right.
6162820	6164180	I'm the fan of the no prize.
6165620	6168660	The old, uh, no prize that Marvel did.
6169380	6169620	Right.
6171060	6171540	All right.
6171540	6178260	Uh, Hey, this is a prize and a real tweet, uh, tweet treat, uh, for those that, uh, bought
6178260	6182580	quake when it was re-released, you know, that remaster that they put out recently, uh, on
6182580	6183220	PC.
6183220	6185700	And I know it's on Xbox and all that good stuff.
6185700	6190820	Um, this was back in August when they released it, even the switch got this and now this
6190820	6191540	is pretty cool.
6191540	6195380	They have updated quake a 25 year old game.
6195380	6197940	They've gone, but not just the remaster, but now they've updated it.
6197940	6201140	There is a new co-op hoard mode.
6201140	6202260	So that's kind of cool.
6202260	6203940	So yeah, now you can do a little more.
6203940	6204180	Yeah.
6204180	6205940	Like PVE type of thing in the game.
6206100	6206660	So that's cool.
6206660	6209620	And there's new maps that they're putting in and another campaign.
6209620	6213380	And of course, bug fixes because who doesn't love bug fixes.
6213380	6214740	So that's great.
6214740	6216180	And this just came out this last week.
6216180	6220740	It's update two for quake, uh, machine games built the hoard mode.
6220740	6224020	And, uh, this is the studio that was behind the Wolfenstein revivals.
6224020	6229380	You can play this by yourself or up to three friends, and there are four new maps to support
6229380	6230100	the role.
6230100	6231620	So that's, that's great.
6232180	6234900	There's also one more expansion called honey.
6234900	6240020	It's a dark and creepy underground town, uh, with more secrets, more enemies, you know,
6240020	6243220	typical quake stuff, shoot it in the face, et cetera, et cetera.
6243220	6247460	I, I, I'm a fan of the quake remaster, but I have really fond memories of the original
6247460	6253540	to go back to, uh, playing that over the internet, uh, via modem when I was in the college dorms.
6253540	6254900	So it's pretty awesome.
6254900	6260740	Dr. Suya says it's been a little while since I've been on quake.
6260740	6261940	So might need to fire it up again.
6261940	6266340	I remember the original team fortress, not the fortress two, but the OG team fortress,
6266340	6271620	which was a quake mod, because that's where valve got a lot of their people were the modding
6271620	6272100	community.
6272100	6273060	That's where Dota came.
6273060	6274260	Dota two came from as well.
6274260	6275300	It was a Warcraft three mod.
6275300	6276660	One thing valve is really good at.
6277220	6277860	Yeah.
6277860	6279860	I wonder why they stopped doing that.
6279860	6280260	All right.
6280820	6284100	Anyway, um, that was it.
6284100	6286500	That was the last story I had slotted for tonight.
6286500	6288020	So we're going to get to the listener round table.
6288020	6289860	We're going to take your questions and chat.
6289860	6294340	We're also going to welcome your calls in the green room over at, uh, I almost said
6294340	6295940	twitch.tv slash vog network.
6295940	6300740	Well, that's the place to send questions too, but also at vog network.com slash discord.
6300740	6304340	You can join our discord community and we get sent stories throughout the week, which
6304340	6304980	is really cool.
6305540	6307140	And then you can chat about the shows.
6307140	6309860	Uh, we, we, the hosts check in once in a while too.
6309860	6311540	You can send things to us.
6311540	6317620	I got sent earlier today, a Ninja turtles cross golden girls fanfic shirt or something
6317620	6321780	that, uh, it was because I am a golden girl fan, uh, at heart.
6321780	6325700	My only concern is that the golden girls are like literally everywhere at this point.
6325700	6327860	And it's almost, it's almost becoming too much.
6327860	6328660	I just, you know what?
6328660	6332820	I like reruns on TV or Hulu or whatever.
6332820	6334260	That's where I like my golden girls.
6334820	6335220	Anyway.
6336100	6339780	Um, let's get to the mailbag, participate at orange long trader.com.
6339780	6344020	If you want to send us an email, uh, I think we had at least one when I went to just one.
6344020	6344500	All right.
6344500	6344900	Go forward.
6345780	6353620	So, um, the one email we have, dear Rob, first off, you're, you're a wonderful human being
6353620	6357140	and you have brought thousands of hours of happiness to my life through the power of
6357140	6358260	this podcast.
6358260	6367620	However, however, Rob, I got something to say, please do not assume that people wouldn't
6367620	6371140	be upset if Square Enix botched your remake of chrono cross.
6371140	6374340	That game to me is what chrono trigger is to you and others.
6374420	6378500	It told a heart-wrenching story that had me in tears within the first hour.
6378500	6382260	Those characters, that irreplaceable soundtrack, the unique battle system.
6382260	6383220	It's fucking great.
6383780	6387380	I typed this email while on a late night walk outside on my phone.
6387380	6389780	So I apologize for any grammatical mistakes.
6389780	6390660	You were fine.
6391140	6396580	I just had to respond to that comment when I heard it with love for the OLR fan, Garth
6396580	6397060	Wolf.
6398500	6403060	All I have to say is there's, there's always gotta be that guy.
6403700	6404580	Congratulations.
6405460	6407220	But what about this?
6407220	6408260	No, I, I get it.
6408260	6409940	Look, your, your feelings are valid.
6409940	6415940	Certainly everybody has interesting emotional connections to games that maybe not everybody
6415940	6417220	else feels the same way too.
6417220	6421140	Like, you know, we never shut up about the guardian legend and how amazing that game
6421140	6424100	is and how we'd love to revisit it if done right someday.
6424980	6427860	But the reality is a lot of people don't know about that game.
6427860	6431060	And so if they never came out with one, a lot of people would probably be none the wiser.
6431460	6437060	Um, but sure, uh, with Chrono Cross, of course there were people that played it and really,
6437060	6439860	really, especially, and I think a lot of it might have to do with your age too.
6439860	6445300	Like, uh, you know, Bobby's said this before and I tend to agree with it that your favorite
6445300	6448580	Final Fantasy game is probably the one that was out when you were 12.
6449380	6454340	Um, and for me, that was probably around Final Fantasy four, maybe technically probably two
6454340	6456740	and three in Japan, but probably about Final Fantasy four.
6456740	6461700	And yeah, that probably, I don't know, Final Fantasy six has aged so well, but I would
6461700	6462900	say four is definitely up there.
6462900	6465060	I probably like four more than most people do.
6465060	6466580	And I think there's something to that.
6466580	6471940	And I would bet you were probably knowing your age, you were probably around 12 when
6471940	6473140	Chrono Cross came out.
6473700	6478100	And so that game probably has a lot of meaning to you just because of that particular moment
6478100	6478900	in your life.
6478900	6482980	And nothing some asshole says on a podcast is ever going to ruin that.
6482980	6484020	Remember that.
6484020	6486100	So, you know, treasure those memories.
6487220	6491700	But Dark Sakura will ruin you if you, if you deserve it.
6492980	6494180	I will ruin a bitch.
6495140	6496340	I'm good at that too.
6496340	6497140	All right.
6497140	6498180	Thank you for the email though.
6498180	6499140	Especially the first part.
6499780	6500260	All right.
6500260	6500900	Appreciate it.
6501460	6506020	Again, if you want to send us an email, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send
6506020	6506900	an email.
6506900	6510020	I see a dear friend of the show has stepped into the green room.
6510020	6514100	I know we want to get some last minute stories from Loki here, if there are any first.
6514100	6515060	Okay, well, great.
6515060	6515700	Well, then good.
6515700	6517220	We have extra time for calls.
6517220	6519700	So let's get to, uh, some calls.
6519700	6520260	Hello.
6520260	6521860	You're on orange lounge radio.
6521860	6522340	Who's this?
6523140	6525940	Two episodes in a row of extended conversation with me.
6525940	6526820	Are you sick of me yet?
6527380	6527940	Not at all.
6527940	6528580	Never.
6528580	6531380	And, uh, you know, Jason, you do great work for the show.
6531380	6536100	People don't realize I was very late in providing a show content tonight because I was out doing
6536100	6536340	stuff.
6536340	6540180	I was walking and stuff, you know, my health comes first, but no, seriously, like Jason
6540180	6542100	put together tonight's intro and like 10 minutes.
6542100	6543060	It was pretty impressive.
6543060	6543780	So congrats.
6543780	6544500	Thank you.
6544500	6548500	I gotta, I gotta, you know, the, the obvious fallback is that since I can see your folks
6548500	6551380	preparation as well, I can pick on that.
6551380	6556020	Generally, you have all of the stories in there, but it's certainly given that I went
6556020	6561220	with the, you know, the very meta overview of everything going on and not one particular
6561220	6561620	story.
6561620	6563700	It was a much more, it was a much easier list.
6564500	6567460	There have been weeks and it's been my fault, not yours.
6567460	6570820	You provide a great service to the show, but in the past, I'm thinking probably even in
6570820	6574980	the pre Twitch days where, um, I would, you, you would do that.
6574980	6578180	You would pick the show from the article and it wasn't something I show.
6578180	6579620	Yeah, I remember a couple of times.
6579620	6582900	So I would, I would have to just say, Oh, by the way, I want to talk about this during
6582900	6584980	rapid fire news for reasons.
6584980	6588180	So all good, all good.
6588180	6589060	We all appreciate.
6589060	6594980	I love it when you sneak in, you use your intro to sneak in your opinion in that 32nd
6594980	6598900	time slot or whatever long, however long the loop is.
6598900	6601620	Actually, you guys may not, we'll let you peek behind the curtain a little bit.
6602180	6605220	Jason does have two versions of that intro.
6605220	6610260	If I remember right, there's one that has an extra loop of one of the measures in it.
6610260	6613380	So Jason can have like eight more seconds to say something if he needs it.
6614020	6614340	Yeah.
6614340	6619060	I don't even remember when we put it to use, God, that was like, what, four or five months
6619060	6622580	ago or something about that, but there was something, yeah, there was something that
6622580	6626900	I definitely wanted to, I definitely wanted to drill into a lot more apparently.
6626900	6630180	So it's like, well, music is loopable.
6630180	6636100	The composition is very well put together and has a couple key points.
6636100	6637060	You're very welcome.
6637060	6641380	Has a couple of key points that are easy to just, you know, move off of and extend.
6641380	6647860	And it sounds very natural between a good composition with well-defined breaks and also
6647860	6653380	software that makes it stupid easy these days to just, Hey, I want to repeat this section.
6653380	6654100	Okay.
6654100	6657220	And there was an, and no disrespect for logic pro right.
6657220	6662100	And, and no disrespect to our old intro, because that was given to us by somebody who was going
6662100	6667380	to put it on an album at one point and basically couldn't find the right, uh, match for it,
6667380	6668820	but thought it made a good bump.
6668820	6671300	And anyway, gave it to us for the intro for our show.
6671300	6672500	But, uh, and we loved it.
6672500	6676740	We used it for over a decade here on the show and shout out to midi head who put that together.
6676740	6682980	If he even, if he even makes music anymore, but there was that little time frame in there
6683620	6687300	that couldn't be changed because it was just like the music wasn't really loopable or
6687300	6688020	anything like that.
6688020	6692820	So, uh, but now with this new one, we have the ability to, if we want to have a longer
6692820	6694260	intro tonight, we can do that.
6694260	6699780	The actual video that pans around the studio and also goes on for like two minutes.
6699780	6704500	So technically if Jason wanted to have like a two minute intro, we could do it, but I'm
6704500	6705380	careful what you wish for.
6707380	6711220	I have, I have thought about things and yeah, you're not wrong.
6711220	6712260	Be careful what you wish for.
6712260	6716340	Some of these days, uh, I, uh, geez, I think it was the last time I was in the studio.
6716340	6720580	I made the, I made the joke that one of these days, the intro you're going to get is it
6720580	6726580	was a colder and stormy night on December 5th in Sacramento, California, when the leaves
6726580	6727620	were changing color.
6727620	6727860	Yeah.
6727860	6728580	Anyways.
6728580	6731780	Uh, I just, I agree with pod culture for an April fool intro.
6731780	6734580	I think you just, you should just start the show in the intro.
6736500	6740500	Anyway, uh, we can have an extended conversation now though.
6740500	6741620	What did you want to talk about tonight?
6742180	6742420	Yeah.
6742420	6747460	So I actually wanted to, I wanted, I did want to give an opinion and I wanted to expand
6747460	6750980	on the dig that I put in the very, very start of the intro.
6750980	6756260	Um, basically like the, the point that I'm making, and I'm gonna explain it a little
6756260	6757060	bit more broadly.
6757060	6759300	The point I played, should I play the intro again?
6759940	6762660	But if you have it on, if you have it on, yeah, absolutely.
6762660	6763140	I do.
6763140	6766420	I'm just going to warn you actually won't hear it, but the listeners will.
6766420	6767780	So I'll tell you when we're on the other side.
6767780	6768980	So here's a reminder here.
6769380	6770100	Oh my God.
6770100	6771380	The show's starting over.
6771380	6771620	No.
6781460	6784900	It's another week and another groundswell launch with rampant service issues.
6784900	6789300	But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe, mashups,
6789300	6793060	ongoing social sagas, new release, strife, remasters, and rereleases, and a couple of
6793060	6793620	glitches.
6793620	6797300	It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums and video games.
6797300	6799140	The things we hold near and dear to our hearts.
6800340	6803860	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details
6803860	6804740	of all this and more.
6804740	6806980	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
6808580	6809460	All right, there you go.
6810100	6811780	Hello, everybody out there on the internet.
6812660	6815780	And I'm going to, I'm going to let this video keep playing so you can see how long it is
6815780	6816900	while Jason gives his thoughts.
6816900	6817780	So there's the intro.
6819460	6823060	Groundswell launch was my two big words.
6823060	6826660	What were the two big words also saying that like, this isn't news.
6826660	6830500	Because it's not, you know, every multiplayer launch.
6830500	6831540	Diablo 3.
6832580	6835380	I mean, I guess No Man's Sky wasn't exactly live multiplayer.
6835380	6838100	I don't remember them having server issues at launch.
6838100	6842500	But like this, and I said this, you read out the comment when I said it when we were talking
6842500	6843620	in the intro in chat.
6844180	6846820	This problem will not be solved.
6846820	6847300	Period.
6847300	6848260	It is not going to be.
6848260	6850820	Like there's always going to be a reason given for it.
6850820	6851860	You had your opinion.
6852660	6856740	Yoshi P had Yoshi T.
6857300	6858660	Yoshi P right.
6858660	6859620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6860420	6864340	He had his opinion about the supply chain aspect of it, which is true.
6864340	6867060	But it doesn't explain why every other one in the past is hard.
6867780	6869300	Scaling is hard.
6869300	6870500	I mean, look at Twitter.
6871140	6876500	The fail whale was such a prominent thing in history because scale is hard.
6877140	6884420	Yeah, like you can you can point to any service growing up or just launching this is what
6884420	6887300	Final Fantasy 14 fifth expansion.
6887860	6893060	It depends if you count Realm Reborn as an expansion or the base game.
6893060	6894180	Well, it's true.
6894900	6896820	I consider Realm Reborn the base game.
6897380	6899940	Because that is what everything else is built on now.
6899940	6904340	But anyway, computing follows human analogs.
6904340	6905860	Computing is not different.
6905860	6906820	It's just another medium.
6906820	6911700	I've talked about social networks in the past and Facebook is having all of these social
6911700	6916100	problems because of the large public town square problem that every single community
6916100	6916500	happens.
6917540	6918740	Final Fantasy 14.
6919860	6920900	Picture it as a mall.
6921460	6926660	It has tons of entrances to individual stores, to general common areas.
6926660	6928340	When does it suck the most?
6929540	6931860	Black Friday and December 24th.
6931860	6938180	And all of the summer days when the kids can just come in at will, you know, like every
6938180	6940900	critical mass is difficult everywhere.
6940900	6943700	These problems will not go away.
6943700	6947380	And if they are like it's going to it's going to fucking bankrupt the company that finally
6947380	6951300	doesn't write because they're going to be so severely over provisioned that, you know,
6951300	6956980	they're going to blow they're going to blow all their profit and then some because and
6956980	6962740	if it's and even even if they over provision, especially in computing, even if Square Enix
6962740	6969700	set up three more data centers filled with 500 more servers to do everything.
6969700	6972580	Some other component in the middle is going to break down.
6972580	6976740	DNS is going to break and some some players aren't going to be able to connect.
6976740	6981060	Interconnection is going to is going to break between data servers and some segment of players
6981060	6981860	are going to get dropped off.
6981860	6986100	Some servers are going to go down like these are not solved problems.
6986100	6991300	Servers a service is a mall service is the stores.
6991300	6997700	You have everybody jamming into a single store and they have to queue up to pay for their
6997700	7003460	items and you have, you know, one or few cash registers that everybody has to go through.
7003460	7007220	Some people leave because they have time commitments and they didn't anticipate the line.
7007220	7011620	You have rabble rousers that's put the put the line to a stop because they complain incessantly
7011620	7014420	about everything and all the other people immediately after.
7014420	7017060	Well, I'm just not going to be around for the conflict, so they peace out.
7019220	7022340	There are too many things that happen down in the weeds.
7022340	7028340	That means that this can just be solved by just, oh, let's just have three more stores
7028340	7029860	in the mall that are all Macy's.
7029860	7030980	That's probably a bad example.
7030980	7032500	How how relevant is Macy's?
7032500	7036340	Let's let's have the dial turn up the graphics on level three, right?
7036340	7040500	That doesn't fix it for for every possible reason.
7040740	7046420	So like it's a I don't have an answer this because like I said, my answer is that it's
7046420	7047700	not it's non-resolvable.
7047700	7053380	These are things we deal with at scale in excess and it is a fact of life.
7053380	7054180	What does that mean?
7054180	7060020	That means you get in on day one and have a subpar experience or don't get in on day
7060020	7066820	one and let the traffic die down, which is the solution in all cases unless they do so
7066820	7069540	that the company does something critically wrong and just folds up to that point.
7069540	7072500	But this is this will not be a solved problem ever.
7072500	7078900	And if it is, they lied about thousands of people beating down the front door when it
7078900	7081220	was maybe 50 that they had to cater to.
7081220	7084180	Like that's I do not see a third option.
7084180	7085620	That is the way I see it.
7085620	7090340	They lie about the demand or it or you will have problems.
7090340	7091140	Period.
7091140	7091640	Yeah.
7092340	7092500	Yeah.
7092500	7095380	And Zen Monkey 11 in chat says it will be solved with more servers.
7095380	7100100	And I think that that is but then it's funny because then when you put then you get Wow's
7100100	7104100	problem, you have too many servers, then the population starts dying and the servers feel
7104100	7104580	empty.
7104580	7109460	Now Wow did a really smart thing with the whole like cross server thing that is so seamless
7109460	7112020	in that game, which Final Fantasy 14 has really struggled with.
7112020	7116660	Like they're just now getting to data center travel, hopefully in 6.1.
7116660	7120420	But after this whole mess, I would not be surprised if that gets put off a little bit
7120420	7122180	because here's something that's very interesting.
7122180	7127940	And they were touting this feature that was supposed to be in the 6.0 thing that within
7127940	7133700	your data center, you could automatically queue for the world with the lowest pop with
7133700	7136340	the lowest queue, lowest line to get in.
7136340	7138100	But here's the hilarious part.
7138100	7142900	That feature doesn't work right now because when it consistently tries to load your character
7142900	7148340	data, which is needed for that future feature, it keeps timing out because there are literally
7148340	7152100	like everybody else requesting their player data.
7152740	7155940	And that's exactly my point of these auxiliary things.
7155940	7162580	Like the DNS system has to work out the centralized storage of something that spans multiple stores
7162580	7171060	like iPhone launches, you know, new phone launches, like those all boil down to physical
7171060	7176660	stock and what, you know, three large tier providers and maybe all of these other little
7176660	7182740	offshoots, US Cellular and I mean, Ting is just a sub to Verizon and all that kind of
7182740	7182820	thing.
7182820	7185060	How about a fucking PlayStation 5?
7185060	7186980	Why don't we just use that as an example?
7186980	7189620	I still can't get one, you know, like.
7191220	7191620	Yeah.
7191620	7195220	And that's, I don't want to draw that comparison.
7196020	7200500	I mean, I do because it's not like, yes, digital is digital and you can just copy and paste
7200500	7203460	infinitely, but those all take storage somewhere.
7203460	7204740	Those all take bandwidth.
7204740	7206660	That all takes routing power.
7207380	7209780	Yeah, it is not ultimately all that different.
7209780	7210820	Common denominator.
7210820	7211140	Yeah.
7211140	7216900	Is that the superconductor shortage is screwing the PlayStation 5 and the superconductor shortage
7216900	7222340	screwed the contingency plans that, you know, to basically turn up the graphics and turn
7222340	7224740	up the server space that they had in place.
7224740	7228660	So basically gaming is fucked right now because a crypto coin.
7230580	7232420	That is all true for this year.
7232420	7234580	It's going to happen on Final Fantasy.
7235940	7239060	Let's call it 17 or the next or the next expansion.
7239060	7245060	Like it's going to happen again, even with society getting back to a, you know, surplus
7245060	7249700	possible situation because it happened in all years prior to coin mining and everything
7249700	7251540	else like scaling.
7251540	7257060	Scaling is hard for everyone ever always, period.
7257060	7259700	There is no ifs, ands or buts about it.
7259700	7265700	This is, I have this thing that I say whenever I can distill it down this concretely.
7265700	7272020	Technology doesn't fix social problems and scaling is a social problem.
7272020	7274420	It's just in the service and technical world.
7274420	7279780	It's very highly a technological problem, but it underpins people, society and social
7279780	7280500	events.
7280500	7282420	Technology does not fix social problems.
7282420	7284660	These are evergreen problems.
7284660	7286100	They will not be resolved.
7286100	7287620	And what does that mean?
7287620	7294660	That means that we're going to complain and suffer and we will perpetually have to deal
7294660	7295140	with it.
7295140	7298180	And, you know, I'm not saying don't have the conversation about it.
7298180	7300420	I'm just saying don't be surprised by it.
7300420	7304820	Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they can also solve it for the time being by giving every player
7304820	7308980	or server a set play time, like a two hour long log or whatever.
7308980	7310100	Then they log you out.
7310100	7312020	You know, there's that noise.
7312020	7313860	Yeah, there's a part of that I get.
7313860	7317140	But at the same time, like what if you're in the middle of an instance playing with
7317220	7319620	other people when you hit your two hours is up, you know?
7319620	7323140	And what if the timer starts when you queue and not when you actually start playing?
7323140	7323780	Whoops.
7323780	7326180	There'd be a lot of like I get that solution.
7326180	7328100	It does seem like on paper that's a good way to do it.
7328100	7332660	But I just think in practice, it's going to cause even more frustration and that whole
7332660	7333540	type of thing.
7333540	7339620	I really think the answer here and I think what Yoshi P and Square need to take a good
7339620	7340100	look at.
7340740	7343620	Is it a good idea to release so much content at once?
7344340	7349860	And I think maybe I know that is such a weird thing that I'm saying, but maybe the answer
7349860	7351300	is maybe they should.
7351300	7354180	That's why that's why I'm saying delay the raid.
7354180	7358900	Do not add to this issue by making people feel like they got a gun so fast to get to
7358900	7360180	that raid and all this stuff.
7360180	7364820	I think if they had, you know, I said earlier, they probably should have delayed Endwalker
7364820	7365540	again.
7365540	7369220	But you know what they could have done that might have helped a little bit with this?
7369220	7373300	And maybe if as they're sitting down looking at their lessons learned, what if they had
7373300	7377860	released the new jobs Reaper and Sage on Friday?
7378660	7380580	And then you know what?
7380580	7382420	We'll release the story in January.
7384020	7387380	It's just about the people like that may that may have softened.
7388420	7390260	Anything can soften the blue.
7390260	7394100	Anything can soften the blow and incremental solutions should be possible, but it's not
7394100	7395380	going to fix it.
7396500	7402660	Rocket League, Rocket League's season five under Epic just started two weeks ago.
7402740	7408500	And like the skill level at the start of the season is completely different than the skill
7408500	7409940	level at the end of the season.
7409940	7418340	The queuing times for matches, despite a despite a healthier population to match make against
7418340	7423700	is a little bit slower because of the higher levels of communication and arrangement that
7423700	7424340	has to happen.
7425700	7428820	You know, like you're going to go into the first game you get, but when there's so many
7428820	7433700	more queuing at the same time, first come first serve, the line is longer.
7433700	7435860	So it takes a little bit longer.
7435860	7439060	Granted, that means I'm waiting like five or 10 more seconds.
7439060	7444020	I'm not complaining for Rocket League capacity at all by comparison.
7444020	7452820	But like I am in favor of optimizations because that is what it always will be.
7453380	7454660	Like I said, don't stop.
7454660	7456340	Don't stop attempting to improve.
7456340	7456980	Don't stop.
7457620	7459060	Don't stop talking about it.
7459060	7463700	Like I'm not the don't don't don't avoid chasing the solution.
7464260	7466020	Just don't be surprised by it.
7466020	7470260	It's going to be quite a day and probably a lie when somebody says that they prevented
7470980	7472660	these launch catastrophes.
7472660	7472900	Yeah.
7472900	7478420	And honestly, like I'm sure Yoshi P and his team are looking for that solution, but until
7478420	7481060	they find it, they're going to have to keep doling out free game time.
7481620	7482260	Let's be real.
7482820	7483780	Let's call it like it is.
7484340	7487380	The frontline developers are doing all of that work.
7487380	7492900	And Yoshi P is, you know, finagling leadership.
7492900	7493940	Leadership is leading.
7493940	7495380	Frontline developers are doing.
7496340	7502260	But yes, yes, the team is absolutely doing everything they can within reasonable human
7502260	7507220	capacity and waking hours and energy and mind actually functioning appropriately.
7507220	7511860	There is an element of this, though, where I think Yoshi P and really Square, and this
7511860	7515220	would go outside the frontline developers, is really try to address this question.
7515220	7518260	Where can we get the servers without the superconductors?
7518260	7523540	Like and I this is ridiculous, and I wouldn't say they actually do this, but can we pull
7523540	7528740	Final Fantasy 11 servers and make them 14 servers to handle this load?
7528740	7529780	Now, obviously, I would.
7529780	7533380	And there's folks that play Final Fantasy 11 that would it would stab me if I said that
7534020	7535060	with seriousness.
7535060	7541460	But, you know, can we allocate the resources from somewhere else, even if that's Tomb Raider
7541460	7544660	or some other game that is under Square's watch?
7544660	7547300	Can we allocate those resources to 14 somehow?
7547300	7548020	And I don't know.
7548020	7551620	Yeah, again, but I think those are the types of questions they have to kind of look at.
7551620	7554100	How can we get superconductors if we can't get new ones?
7554820	7559860	But by the time they do that, social, you know, demand will probably drop enough that
7559860	7562980	it will be less important.
7562980	7563700	Yeah.
7563700	7566260	A lot of people will have canceled their subscriptions because they're sick of dealing
7566260	7567140	with it.
7567140	7569220	But if the game is strong enough, they'll come back.
7569220	7569720	We'll see.
7570280	7570780	Yeah.
7571080	7573160	Jason, I really appreciate the perspective, of course.
7573880	7575080	Thank you for calling in.
7575080	7575720	Appreciate it.
7575720	7576280	Anything else?
7576280	7577720	Anything else on your mind before we let you go?
7578440	7578840	No, sir.
7578840	7579960	Enjoy the rest of the night, everyone.
7582680	7583180	All right.
7584120	7585880	He cracked up for me a little bit there at the end.
7585880	7590040	I don't know if it was just my headphones or whatever, but yeah, a good goodbye and
7590040	7590840	farewell to Jason.
7590840	7593000	We'll hear him in the intro for next week.
7593800	7595160	Let me peek back at the green room.
7595160	7596520	OK, I don't see anybody else in there.
7597160	7599960	So I think we are about where we can wrap up.
7599960	7602200	Loki, you said you had no last minute stories, right?
7602200	7602680	Not at all.
7603400	7605400	So then I think we can wrap up.
7605400	7608600	So I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight, whether you were watching

7633320	7634840	All of it goes a long way.
7634840	7635640	Thank you very much.
7636440	7637720	There is no shop currently.
7637720	7640920	It's down for maintenance, but we're hoping to get that resolved relatively soon.
7641720	7644360	And that is, I think, it for me.
7644360	7646840	Join our Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7646840	7649240	Let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.
7649240	7654360	I will start with DarkSakura as I know she's going to get ready for her post-party here
7654360	7655480	live tonight on Twitch.
7656040	7657400	That's a good way to phrase it.
7658680	7660200	I don't really have anything.
7660200	7663880	I'm kind of in meh mode for right now.
7664520	7669960	So tune in, see what happens on stuff.
7669960	7673000	Watch me break down live on the internet and everything's good.
7673640	7675800	We'll feel better and hang in there, DarkSakura.
7675800	7676760	I feel all right.
7676760	7677480	All right.
7677480	7678040	Have a great night.
7678040	7679080	We'll talk to you next week.
7679560	7680520	Later, Tater.
7680520	7681000	All right.
7681000	7682280	And we will go to Loki.
7682280	7683240	Your final thought tonight.
7684440	7689240	My final thought is I hope our season two of NerdCraft gets started here pretty soon.
7689240	7691560	It's just waiting on the Ram to arrive.
7692440	7693640	It's a long wait.
7695560	7699320	I'm just, I'm very much anticipating that getting started soon.
7701000	7706600	And my final thought is I'm seeing a lot of positive changes from everything I've had
7706600	7709640	to change in my life with everything that happened a month ago.
7710680	7715880	And yeah, my weight loss is starting to show up on the scale, which I like.
7716600	7721000	Not that you should let your weight define you, but the reality is I'm gonna have to
7721000	7724440	lose a little bit if I want to get around everything that's kind of happened lately.
7724440	7728280	So it's very nice that things are moving in that positive direction.
7728280	7729320	I'm very happy about it.
7729320	7730600	So cross your fingers.
7730600	7732040	I can keep it going for another couple months.
7732040	7733000	It'd be great.
7733000	7738200	So hopefully someday a skinny legend again, like I was when I was 18.
7738840	7739240	All right.
7740120	7742680	But being a little twunk is okay too.
7742680	7744440	I have a good night, everybody.
7745080	7747160	We'll see you next time for more Orange Launch Radio.
7747160	7750520	We'll be back in seven days to talk about the game awards this week.
7750520	7753960	I'm sure there's going to be a lot of stuff and reveals we'll want to talk about.
7754520	7759320	Maybe some surprises, whether that be reveals or something someone does or says at the show.
7759320	7761800	We'll talk about all that and whatever else comes up in the news.
7761880	7765720	And I hope to God our lead story next week is Bobby Kotick's resignation.
7765720	7767880	But if it's not, we'll keep asking for it.
7767880	7769960	So we'll be here next week to do it all again.
7769960	7770680	Happy gaming.
7771800	7773320	May the odds be ever in your favor.
7773320	7776760	If you're battling the Q's and Final Fantasy 14, I hope you're having a lot of fun.
7776760	7780040	Even if you're playing a classic like Minecraft or whatever it is you're playing.
7780040	7780840	Happy gaming.
7781880	7783320	Enjoy the holidays, everybody.
7783320	7785560	We'll see you next week here on Orange Launch Radio.
