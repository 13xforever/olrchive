00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today, I have just a few words about Masayuki Uemura. He helped design some of the most influential gaming systems I played, and we all know them behind the name Nintendo. I know little about him personally, I can only laud his work on what were incredibly influential systems, and that's all I want to do. Uemura-san, your contributions are invaluable.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My eulogy is done, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you the rest of tonight's news and their own thoughts. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back. It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice, and I'm one of those voices. Hi, I am Rob Roberts, and joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello, hello. We are here, joined together to discuss games for episode 895, December the 12th of 2021. Can you believe it, DarkSakura? We're just like three weeks away, I think, from our 20th year of broadcasting?

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, I believe it. I feel, I feel old, creaky.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, actually, yeah, with, with everything I've gone through medically the last year, it's like, I'm starting to feel a little old too. You know, I was, I was out walking yesterday.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I've talked previously on the show, Pikmin Bloom's been a great motivator for that, but I need to be walking anyway because of the things that I'm going through.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But as I'm walking, then like my leg is starting to hurt and cramp, and I'm like, ow, and I'm like, getting old sucks, damned if you do, damned if you don't. You need to walk, leg, don't walk.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rob. What? Rob. What? Take magnesium. I try to take- Seriously. I think the vitamins I take have that in it, maybe? I don't know. No, take magnesium before you go to bed, trust me.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay. All right. I'll look into it. So you, and you did, you worked at a supplement store for a while.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, not just there, you know, I was a massage therapist and did the holistic medicine off and on. So, but, um, I, I was waking up in the middle of the night with leg cramps.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That doesn't happen to me anymore.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But, but magnesium helps with, with leg cramping and muscle soreness.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know what does happen to me in the middle of the night though? Here's, I'm going to, I'm going to- And I'm not a doctor, so don't quote me.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, that's fine. That's fine. It's, you know what, still, asking Jamie is better than asking WebMD, trust. Um, so here's, here's, diagnose this problem, Jamie. I'm curious about this.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, you know, I like, I like to use the apps with my smartwatch. Oh, let me introduce tech master, Loki. Hi, Loki.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hi.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you want to diagnose this, you can too. And then I'll ask you about what you've got playing there. So, okay. So here's the thing. So I have like the smartwatch that measures my heart rate when I sleep. Right.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And that I stand so many hours and all that stuff. Right. Here's the thing. So I was looking at me sleeping yesterday and my little thing tells me I was up between 230 and like 245 and I was standing apparently.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't remember it. So is this like a, um, what's that, what's that scary movie where the, the, the camera watches the people sleep and they get up and do horrible things in the middle of the night? Is that, is that, am I possessed?

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Am I sleepwalking? I don't know.

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I sleepwalk.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Um, part of what I'm going through medically came from the fact that I used to sleepwalk a lot.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll just, I'll go ahead and just tell everybody I might've, I've mentioned some of it before, but I'm being tested for, for narcolepsy.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And one of the symptoms of untreated narcolepsy is sleepwalking and sometimes waking up eating.

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Um, also, uh, sleep paralysis, night terrors. They go with it too. Um, talking in your sleep, but, uh, I, I, I, I wake up in the bathroom.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
See that that's never happened to me. If that was happening to me, then I feel like I, I know the explanation a little better, but I've never, and Alan's never said I do anything. And I know Alan's up at all hours.

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you sleep on your stomach?

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Uh, no, no, more of my side than anything.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was going to say, cause sometimes the standing can trigger if your arm is laying over the side of the bed.

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hmm.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Um, sometimes it can just be from general twitchiness and elevation and heart rate.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I guess it thinks you're doing something.

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I guess so. And, uh, go into our chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby black will show.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And Jason is there, our voiceover man saying, you're not sleepwalking, Rob, you're just tossing and turning. And that's enough to register as a stand.

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You would know if you were sleepwalking because someone would tell you, or as Jamie just said, you would wake up in a place you didn't go to sleep in.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But, and you know what? I would believe that because I do do this weird thing and I promise we're a video game show, but we're a three hour video game show.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So we talk about a lot. I do do this weird thing and Alan makes fun of me for it constantly.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We're like, I put, I don't know how to explain it. I like lie down in a way I put my legs up so that my knees are like way up in the air, even though my feet are on the bed, but like I'm bending my legs and I do this, I do it while I sleep like, and I don't realize I'm doing it.

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I'm not surprised. I'm probably contorting into all sorts of weird positions when I sleep. So, yeah, that could very well be it.

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, since I've been going off of my meds, I'm actually having, and I'm pretty sure that they're bouts of sleep paralysis that I'm just not remembering, but I wake up stiffer than usual because I used to sort of toss around a lot when I, when I'm medicated.

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And now I, I wake up really, really stiff and sore. I mean, part of, part of withdrawing from SSI, we were talking about this before the show, I was trying to check some of my symptoms because I've been feeling just so funky in other ways apart from my mood coming off of my SSRIs.

45
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This, my antidepressants is that I've been feeling like sick, like almost fluish. And I thought that was just from my chronic fatigue getting worse since I'm coming off my meds, but it's another symptom on there along with like extra muscle soreness and nausea.

46
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And I have been really nauseous lately, so I'm coming off of like four different medications. So the fact that I am sitting up right now after as little sleep as I got last night, kind of a feat.

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
She's, she's here, here for y'all.

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Caffeine sippy sippy.

49
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you, SJ 100. Matt, who says my girlfriend does that as well when she's sleeping the knee thing. Oh, good. I'm not alone.

50
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She hold 10 and chat says get a bedroom webcam. No, I'm scared to watch that.

51
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm scared to watch it. I won't do it. Sorry. I won't do it. I won't do that.

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I used to fall asleep on my face with my butt sticking in the air.

53
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But the thing is, I'd also watch TV like that when I was, of course, I've been nearsighted all my life and I didn't know.

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So I would sit right in front of the TV with my ear to the ground and my butt in the air bent over because it was comfortable for some reason.

55
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And pixel pockets and chat reminded me of the name of that movie. Thank you. Paranormal Activity. That was it.

56
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That is why I won't film myself. She hope because I'm worried it's going to be that movie. And I just I'd rather be ignorant. Thank you very much.

57
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, I've done an at home sleep study before for the record. I know a couple people have mentioned it.

58
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That was testing me for sleep apnea, which I don't have. This is the one I'm doing is a full in lab overnight study.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And then I'm also doing a nap study. Yes, they are going to study me taking naps.

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or basically, I think I'm going to be taking like a 20 minute nap every two hours for an entire day.

61
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So I'll be getting a lot of artwork done. All right.

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Since I brought up movies, let me pivot back over to Loki. Well, we'll try to get back on the track of video games.

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So I know we're going to talk about the game awards here in a minute, but obviously one of the big things that they revealed.

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In fact, interesting. I think it was the last announcement, which was an interesting thing because we kind of knew it was coming.

65
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The Unreal Engine 5 featuring the Matrix. So the Matrix experience in Unreal Engine 5 and live here at Twitch tonight.

66
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I notice you are playing the demo. It looks like behind you there. I didn't get a chance to check it out.

67
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I know you're a big Matrix fan. Did you? Did you look at it?

68
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, I didn't because my sister's still borrowing my Xbox Series X, so I didn't get to play it.

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I watched videos of it, though. OK, how is it? I haven't even watched it. It looks really nice.

70
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, Bobby was talking a little bit about it on his show. It looks it looks very interesting.

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It looks like it's a lot of elements of the very first movie, but like it's not a movie. It's actually done in Unreal Engine.

72
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So kind of the future, what games will look like. And I'm sure they're trying to push that.

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And they're, of course, that new Matrix movie coming out. They're pushing that, too, and the awareness.

74
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, I'd hope that they're making a new Matrix game because it looks cool. I'd be down for a new Matrix game.

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they didn't announce a new Matrix game because that one that they did around the time of the sequel and the third part of the trilogy,

76
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The Matrix Returns and The Revolutions, like back when those were out, I remember they made a really big deal about the what it was.

77
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It would have been like GameCube, PlayStation 2, because they actually had like Jada Pinkett and one of the other actors in the movie were the stars of the game.

78
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was a whole that was that was enter the Matrix. And the thing with that is that the game was actually part of the storyline, too.

79
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So there was like stuff that in the movie you'd see these characters like walk off screen and then the game would kind of take over from that.

80
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah. So you got to follow those characters and see what they were doing the whole time.

81
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Kind of neat. All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and talk a little bit about the game awards that happened this week.

82
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because, of course, that happened on Thursday and we talked a lot about this last week that we anticipated there were going to be a lot of announcements.

83
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And I think as we know, the game awards are there. They're like awards in lowercase and then in uppercase trailers and commercials.

84
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So the awards are a little bit more of a footnote to this whole thing. But we got a heck of a lot of announcements out of this thing.

85
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Dark Soccer, I couldn't help but think of you when I saw that Sonic Frontiers, because I know you've been a Sega gal for a long time.

86
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What did you think of that whole Sonic Frontiers or excuse me, Sonic Breath of the Wild, as many are calling it? What did you think about that?

87
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It looks neat. Something worth a try. I get and this is always what makes me think of anything like part of the scenery for some reason made me think of in Sonic Adventure.

88
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When you go to see Tikal's temple and it looks like it's way out in the distance, even though it's just sort of like there's just like a little bit of jungle to go through.

89
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And that's kind of what that made me think of. And I remember just that feeling of, oh, gosh, this is pretty big. I mean, in the Dreamcast back in the day, it was pretty big.

90
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So I had kind of that feeling again.

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That also reminds me that they showed that new movie trailer for Sonic 2, which brings me to one of my issues with the Game Awards.

92
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, you should. It's actually and my issue hasn't even seen the first one, though. My issue has nothing to do with the trailer.

93
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The trailer looked cute. It looks like a cute like especially like a family movie. I was like, oh, Loki's looking. The kids are going to have a fun date night.

94
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know what else called family date night at the Sonic 2 movie. It looks it looks nice.

95
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But here's here's one of my issues with the Game Awards is they hype this appearance by Jim Carrey. Right.

96
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, Jim Carrey was there via video in a pre tape thing. And they always and I'm sorry, guys, it looks it looks really bad.

97
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And stage is they try to make it look like, oh, I'm going to talk to him by saying this line that was written on the teleprompter.

98
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Duh, duh, duh. And then he picks up in the prerecorded video where the dialogue left off.

99
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This happened with Keanu Reeves speaking of The Matrix saying later on, too, like they tried to do that live illusion.

100
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But if you really like listen to it and really try to like what you can tell, this is a video trick they do all the time.

101
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I thought that was kind of lame that they advertise an appearance by Jim Carrey and then he wasn't even really there.

102
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He was just in a video message, which I guess was funny. It was funnier than the other guy. Sorry, all TL shade.

103
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But Loki, I know you're a Jim Carrey fan. What did you are you are you OK with with him not showing up for real real?

104
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't care. He doesn't need to be there.

105
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He doesn't need to be there.

106
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No, I wasn't even expecting him to make an appearance. I just want to see a trailer of the movie.

107
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's fair. Cool. They got a video of him. All right. That's nice. It had nothing to do with the movie. I mean, for the most part.

108
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Tiger Claw in chat says Sonic the Hedgehog 2 looks way better than the first movie. And I know Tiger Claw loves the Sonic universe, so I know he's hyped for it because of Knuckles.

109
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I've watched tons of reaction videos and they all went nuts over Knuckles. Yeah, I think I think one of the best memes I saw about the whole thing was like Idris Elba talking about I'm not making Knuckles sing.

110
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's sexy. Knuckles is not a sexy character intended to be sexy. And then the trailer shows up and everybody's like, so sexy.

111
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right. It's like if you're Idris Elba, you have you have to really, really try and not be sexy. That's the problem.

112
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I love Knuckles anyway. Exactly. Exactly. So it's kind of funny. Let's talk about some of the other things that showed up at the Game Awards.

113
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Hey, I was excited about this. Alan Wake 2. It's real. It's happening. I suppose the remaster should have been a clue that this was probably getting revived.

114
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Some folks thought that didn't the American Nightmare count as Alan Wake Part 2? No, that was that wasn't that weird period of Xbox 360 DLC when like DLC was released as like standalone experiences.

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It was weird. There was a few games like that. But anyway, there's an actual Alan Wake 2 coming. It looks scarier. And that's because they're saying this is a survival horror game.

116
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And he talks a little bit about how the first one was more of an action game. So it is kind of a genre shift for Alan Wake. So that'll be interesting.

117
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was not too scared. Excuse me. I'm getting the hiccups scared into me. I'm hoping it's not too scary.

118
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Are those supposed to work the other way around? I know, right? No, but I dare to be different. But I'm excited about Alan Wake 2. I don't know about you guys, but I think it'll look like looks like fun.

119
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They showed a teaser for a new Wonder Woman game. And my reaction. And by the way, we did do a live broadcast. At least Bobby Blackwell, myself kind of teamed up to do a little reaction stream.

120
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it is in the archives over at VOG Network on Twitch for subscribers. Not that I expect you to watch the whole thing again, but maybe. But we had a lot of fun. We had a decent turnout for Thursday night. I was really, really happy with that.

121
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And when they revealed this, Wonder Woman is getting her own game. It was one of those things where I was like, damn, how did she not have her own game?

122
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is definitely one of those things you kind of think about and go, well, this makes a lot of sense. Of course, this should be a thing. How did no one predict that this would happen?

123
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I believe this was also from Rocksteady, who did those Batman games like Arkham City and all that stuff. The stuff that was like really well done.

124
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah. And so they're making the Wonder Woman game now. So I fully expect the Wonder Woman game is going to kick ass too. No pressure.

125
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey, Rob. Do you want to know something offhand? What was that?

126
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Arkham City could be a classic game.

127
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, Jesus. Can it? Well, the Arkham City or just the first one, the Arkham Asylum.

128
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Arkham City. Oh, Jesus. Wow. Well, hopefully they'll apply some of the good stuff in Wonder Woman because no pressure.

129
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know, it's Rocksteady and it's only like DC's probably best movie franchise right now.

130
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You mean they're only good movie franchises right now.

131
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And I saw that trailer for Batman and I don't know. Did you see that trailer for the new Batman? I don't know.

132
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Am I going to watch anything Batman? No, I would rather watch good movies. There hasn't been a good Batman movie since Keaton.

133
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah. It was a really bold decision of them to make Batman a vampire this time, but you know.

134
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I like the Nolan trilogy, but that's a different discussion.

135
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Star Wars Eclipse is a new game. It's coming from Quantic Dream and it looks to be, you know, we heard the rumors about this one.

136
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It better control better. It better be a lot more actionable than Detroit and the other games.

137
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah. Don't get me wrong. I love Detroit, but way too command heavy.

138
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The trailer looked really good though. I got to say that.

139
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I expect good things from Quantic.

140
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Some people taking issue with Quantic Dream because of, you know, this awakening we're having in gaming culture.

141
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That there's a lot of bullshit going on and a lot of that bullshit tied to Quantic Dream.

142
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So that's been a sticking point for a lot of people, especially when Geoff Keighley made that, you know, very heartfelt message at the beginning of the game awards.

143
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then it was like, oh, here's a trailer for a new Quantic Dream game.

144
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I saw that tweet several times on my Twitter feed. A lot of people making that joke, even when it's really not a joke.

145
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But I guess that observation, I suppose.

146
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hopefully the issues at the studio can be worked out. The game itself does look really good, but we'll see when the gameplay shows up.

147
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because you know I'm always about, I want to see the gameplay. I don't get excited by the CGI trailers as much anymore.

148
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But it definitely shows a certain tone to the game that I don't think we've seen in a Star Wars game that I can recall.

149
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A Dune tone?

150
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Maybe.

151
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Elden Ring showed up again. Sorry, they are hyping this way too much for me.

152
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is a Deathloop. I guess Deathloop turned out pretty good.

153
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And No Man's Sky, which No Man's Sky wasn't great when it released, now it's really good.

154
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But you know what I'm talking about, those games where they just hype and hype and hype, and Elden Ring is getting to that for me.

155
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Literally, when they were doing that whole little interaction on the stage with the pot, I was just like, shut up.

156
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Shut up. Just show the trailer. I don't care. Get on with it.

157
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Anyway, sorry. I see George R.R. Martin. I know he's involved with it. That's what makes a lot of people excited.

158
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And I still think, are you ever going to finish the next book? Are you ever going to finish the next book?

159
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No.

160
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We all know.

161
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's see.

162
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
SSJ100Matt, going back to the Jeff statement in chat, a lot of folks felt Jeff was soft with his statement, but I think he did the best he could.

163
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
At least he didn't ignore it. I also agree he did the best he could.

164
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I think if you expected him to get up there and say, yo, fuck Activision and Bobby Kotick and Ubisoft too, I think that's a little bit unrealistic.

165
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Considering that, and I know it sucks, I'm not saying it's not a shitty situation, but a lot of these trailers and the commercial and the money that goes into it is coming from a lot of these companies.

166
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So I feel like he did what he had to do without naming names and get that applause and support that he could.

167
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We'll get into it later in the show, but these companies are doing enough damage themselves that change is going to come because it really looks like it's coming at one of our biggest scenarios.

168
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And we'll get into that later in the show. I know we have a topic on it later, but I think that's kind of important to point out.

169
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They announced Among Us coming to VR, which I'm kind of like a little late for me. I don't know if this is something I'm into, but cute.

170
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Dune is coming back to video games. It's a 4X game and there was a Dune game several years ago, certainly enough to be a classic game of the week.

171
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So it is interesting. They're kind of going back to that with the movie.

172
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The Suicide Squad killed the Justice League had a whole little splash and stuff with it. Deborah Wilson got on stage as Amanda.

173
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's her name? Amanda Waller.

174
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you, Waller. Sorry, I don't follow the comic stuff as much as others.

175
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You gotta watch the movie. It's really good.

176
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I only saw the first one, which honestly I liked.

177
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The second one is even better. It is so much better.

178
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
One of these days I'll binge it. I'm really behind on comic book movies.

179
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Anyway, Deborah Wilson was up on stage. I remember her from Mad TV. She's fantastic.

180
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I was like, did she play Amanda in the movie? I didn't think she played, but I know they changed half the cast for the second movie.

181
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So I was like, maybe they changed that too. But no, she's just the game version of Amanda Waller, I guess.

182
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was fun to see her on stage. I don't think there were very few people in that audience who knew who she was.

183
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I would have been like, woo! But, oh well. I didn't get to go.

184
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I loved you as Whitney. Or Oprah.

185
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hellblade 2 got a new cinematic gameplay look. I gotta say, that was a really cool extended play of that.

186
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They do a lot of neat things with the sound design and literally the voices in her head. It's pretty fantastic.

187
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Like I said, I don't know if I could play it. It looks too intense for me.

188
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But I might watch somebody else play it when I can look away once in a while. That would be nice.

189
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So, yeah. That was another thing they announced.

190
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
There was a brand new television spot for the Halo TV series. It was pretty short.

191
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But they showed it and reinforced that it's coming to Paramount Plus at some point in 2022.

192
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What did y'all think of that? Those that saw it. I thought it was...

193
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Again, Paramount Plus.

194
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I actually have Paramount Plus and I actually think it's a fine streaming service.

195
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I use it more than I use Hulu, to be quite honest.

196
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, I don't know.

197
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
There was a lot of other announcements as well. I'm trying to think.

198
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, this one I definitely want to pick up on. The announcement of Slitterhead.

199
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is from the creator of Silent Hill with music by Akira Yamaoka.

200
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, it's not Silent Hill, Wink, but it's, you know, here we go again.

201
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Old Konami veterans moving on from that wreck to create their own new thing out of the ashes.

202
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Didn't they also do, what was it, Shadows of the Damned?

203
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Was that them? Oh, I know Akira Yamaoka, I think, was involved with that, but I didn't know.

204
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, he did the music for that, but I thought it was the same. I'll have to look it up again.

205
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But, yeah, the trailer looked pretty intense.

206
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And it's funny that everything was on the backdrop of Silent, because when that first came up on the screen about the creator of Silent Hill,

207
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I started to go, because, you know, I thought maybe those rumors about a new Silent Hill were true and then, nah, it's a different thing.

208
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But it's still pretty cool. I'm not going to lie.

209
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But, yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking, Logi. Guillermo del Toro, introducing his movie, and before he introduces his movie, he goes,

210
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You know what game had great art direction? Silent Hill. Man, I'd love to see another one of those someday.

211
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And then just moves on, plugging his thing, and I'm just like, you motherfucker.

212
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Like, I think you saw, you probably saw me on the, the, the speed. I'm like, you motherfucker.

213
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you, you fucking troll. What are you doing, asshole?

214
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Do you, do you think he, what do you, do you think there's something there, or do you think he is literally just being an asshole?

215
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay, so Toyama didn't work on that game. He worked on Gravity Rush.

216
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, yeah. Interesting.

217
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Dartatia, Dartatia in chat says, I'm curious to see how Slitterhead turns out. Definitely could be the same kind of vibe. Yeah.

218
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I am all about this.

219
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes. Oh, Slitterhead?

220
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, I'm all about it.

221
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Definitely up your alley. Definitely thought of you with that. Um, a lot of other stuff too. Uh, new DLC for Cuphead coming on June 30th.

222
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's, that's a ways out for some DLC, but it kind of looks like a whole new game, really, in a way. So, uh, there is that.

223
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Uh, for Spoken, got a release date. It's coming out on May 24th. Oh, Loki, Saints Row. We got, we got a new trailer for that.

224
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I'm curious your thoughts, because you weren't, you weren't feeling it the first time, but how about this time?

225
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm still, it's still okay. I don't know. I don't like the, the characters that they have in it. I mean, the gameplay looks okay, but I don't know.

226
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm still not convinced of new characters yet. They have to show me, like, that I'd be interested in these characters.

227
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
All right.

228
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Like, there'd have to be a dramatic shift in, in their personalities pretty quickly in the game.

229
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There were some funny parts. I'm looking forward to this game getting discounted six months after its release.

230
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Uh, and then I'll finally probably get around, or being free on the Epic Games Store after about a year. I'll probably pick it up.

231
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Game pass.

232
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Or game pass, yeah. We'll see. Um, unless, but if the reviews are really, really good, I might change my mind.

233
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh, I was really excited about this. Uh, the Telltale game format making a comeback in two different ways.

234
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There is a new game called Star Trek Resurgence. It is a Star Trek game from a new studio that's made up of a lot of the developers that used to be with Telltale Games.

235
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Uh, and that looked really good. It's an original story, so it doesn't have any of the characters, uh, that you might know except Spock Prime was in it.

236
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Uh, complete with Leonard Nimoy's likeness, so a pretty impressive feat that they got his likeness.

237
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
His voice is in it, well, I don't know if it's his voice, an impersonator, because, I mean, he could have recorded the lines years ago, we don't know.

238
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Could be a son.

239
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It could be, it could be a lot of things. Um, but, you know, definitely invoking Leonard Nimoy with the trailer, which makes a lot of Star Trek fans a little verklempt.

240
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Which, um, was me as well, so, but I'm, I'm into it. That's, I think the Telltale format, uh, is gonna be great for a Star Trek game.

241
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If Star Trek isn't up your alley and you enjoy other types of sci-fi, well, how about the one that the actual Telltale Games is doing?

242
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
As in, the ones who bought Telltale's name after Telltale went under in, what was it, 2017, 2018, and I think other folks from Telltale are at new Telltale.

243
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Uh, they are making a game based on The Expanse, um, from the, uh, Amazon, uh, that sci-fi series, and I, I don't know as much about that one, except I love, uh, Chidori Ajgalu.

244
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that name, but I don't have it in front of me right now, and she's great, and I know she's in that.

245
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Um, and, uh, I wonder if she's involved with the game, because that would be amazing. Um, so The Expanse. Um, that is coming as well.

246
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Um, let's see, there's a lot, there was a lot of announcements. That all being said, uh, with the announcements, it still felt to me like a little bit lighter of a year than I think the past couple years.

247
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Especially with the whole pomp and circumstance of, it's a return to person, and so forth. Um, I don't know, the announcements felt a little less big than they did in other years.

248
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't know. Um, Loki, what did you think about the announcements overall? And if there's anything else you want to call out, um, please, by all means, I, I didn't get to everything, but there's a lot.

249
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Um, I mean, it was, I don't know, it was alright. I, I didn't really think it was, there wasn't anything like, oh my god, this is so amazing. Um, yeah, I don't, I don't really think there was anything that really, like, made my jaw drop, but there was a lot of cool announcements.

250
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, and SSJ100Matt in chat points out there's no huge AAA surprise, and I think that's what folks were looking for.

251
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I think back to that year that they announced No Man's Sky. Like, that was just like, whoa, what is this? You know, like, there wasn't really anything like that.

252
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Or that in a lot of years, you usually have, um, like a big Nintendo announcement. Like, remember the year that they, they, I think it was like the first gameplay of Breath of the Wild or something that was there.

253
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And Nintendo was really kind of, they were there, and they accepted an award because Metroid Dread won, what, like, best action game.

254
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And it was a little awkward because Doug Bowser accepted the award, which is fine, I understand. He's the president in America, but it's like, he didn't work on the game.

255
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Um, but he did kind of, like, the nice thing was, like, about halfway through his speech, then he was like, I have a message from the development studios. I was like, oh, okay, okay.

256
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Um, but, uh, other than that, Nintendo didn't really have much involvement. Remember, Reggie Fils-Aime has nothing to do with Nintendo anymore.

257
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So even though he presented an award, uh, and was Reggie, it's, it is nice to have that, you know, little bit of Reggie every, every, every year at the Game Awards.

258
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So there is that. Um, Dark Tetsuya says, uh, yeah, I was half expecting something from Nintendo, but I wasn't going to count on it. Sometimes they just don't have anything to show.

259
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:56,000
DJ Rama F says, shout out to Ninjasista from Black Compat. She was spotted on screen in the audience for five seconds. Okay, I thought that was her.

260
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I didn't say anything on the live stream because I wasn't sure because I didn't know she was going. I mean, I guess I could read Facebook more often.

261
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I didn't know she was going and everybody had their masks on in the audience. So I had that moment of, was that? But I didn't want to say it because I was like, well, if I'm wrong, that's going to be very embarrassing, you know,

262
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,000
because when you have your masks on, you can't like totally tell, even though her hair color, uh, as it is right now, should have been unique enough for me to recognize. I just, I hadn't seen the, um, turquoise hair, uh, in a minute.

263
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So yeah, DJ Rama S says, I got the screenshot and I saw her outfit on Facebook. See, I never saw the Facebook post that she was going. Otherwise I would have, I would have seen that. Oh, oh, oh, that's, that's her.

264
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So, uh, Bobby Lockwell says she's an Xbox MVP. So she was there on behalf of Xbox. Hey, I think that's great that Xbox invites their MVPs. I did see Phil Spencer in the audience.

265
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So she, she must've been only a stone's throw away from Phil Spencer. So that's pretty cool. Um, oh yeah, this is funny too.

266
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Thank you SSG100Matt for reminding me about this, that hilarious. Oh, and shout out for Black and Pat. Please drop them a follow here on Twitch if you aren't already.

267
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Um, oh, oh, oh, that hilarious Bethesda commercial that played where they gave away game codes and said they had nothing to show because they were too busy making more ports of Skyrim.

268
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I will say this for it's as much shit as the commercials get that Bethesda one in particular was pretty fucking good. Like not just the fact that it was very like parody and self-aware and they were scrolling those codes so fast on the screen.

269
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And they did it to get the PC game pass. So that Xbox game pass rebranding is PC game pass. They did that where they flashed a bunch of codes and I tried to redeem one on air, but I was too slow. I didn't get it.

270
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Uh, of course, of course I didn't. People are crazy fast. Um, but I thought it was interesting that it was a Bethesda jobs ad because they weren't promoting Starfield or Elder Scrolls 6 or even Deathloop.

271
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They were promoting working there, which is very interesting when you consider Jeff's opening message and everything else going on in the industry right now. I thought that was interesting. Loki, any thoughts on that ad?

272
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Um, no, I don't. I mean, a lot of these different companies have different issues. Um, I don't know, but does it now under the Microsoft umbrella? I don't think as bad of them anymore, but like, I mean, I don't know. Get your foot in the door, I guess.

273
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Um, any, any parting thoughts, like, you know, before we get to our gaming weeks, um, Loki, if you were Jeff Keeley and running the game awards, what might you change for next year? What change might you make for, um, 2022 show?

274
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And I'll open this up to Chad too, over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

275
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I could do without like a lot of the musical performances, to be honest.

276
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You weren't, you weren't a fan of Sting?

277
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Eh, Sting's all right. I like, I'd like me some desert Rose, but like, uh, no, like, I don't know. It's just, it takes up time, I think. And then also like some of the categories they just don't care about. I know other people care about it, but like, you know, content creator of the year.

278
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Like you're talking, you're like picking out of like five, like four people or whatever. Like, no, no, thank you. Um, and then e-sports stuff. People like e-sports, but like, that's not for me.

279
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I, and see, I'm going to take the hot take and some are going to be very mad at me for saying it. I think they should get rid of all those categories. I think they should get rid of the e-sports categories. They should get rid of that because a, they, they go through it in a wink and a flash on the show.

280
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:58,000
B, they don't acknowledge e-sports anywhere else on the show. So it, on, it really feels like a fucking fish tossed out. Like, you know, like, oh, hey, e-sports, what up? Okay. Anyway, moving on. Like, that's, it doesn't, it feels really disjointed.

281
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Um, when, you know, and I say this as a content creator who will never get recognized at the game awards. I just think it's just one of those things where I think they could use the time somewhere else, especially when they, um, they, they don't do anything with it otherwise.

282
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:27,000
They had those nice, they have those nice commercials that spotlight certain creators. Like they had the one in the beginning with the drag queens. They had the, you know, the, the new class, they spotlighted a few of those shout out to DJ night.

283
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Uh, if you still listen to our, uh, and all this stuff, but, um, I, I just, those were nice, but, um, I just feel like for the most part, the shows don't really focus on that. And it's a weird disjointing thing to be awesome.

284
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:58,000
To be honest. Um, also, um, I will say, uh, Loki, I do, I disagree a little bit on the musical performances. Uh, I thought they were all fine. I actually like the tradition of having the orchestra play the nominees of the year. I thought, I think that's actually something I look forward to.

285
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I guess that's a little bit like the Oscars, I guess, but like, I don't know. I liked at least interesting thing for me. Like, it's not that it's bad. It's just like, this is the lowest of interest I have in this part of the show.

286
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I thought, I think you might be addressing the imagined dragon, super giant games thing, which was, and I thought that was just, it was the wrong year for that. I liked the collaboration and I liked the music, the super giant games makes, but their big year was last year and they had nothing to announce this year.

287
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So it seemed a little out of place where it was like, Hey, we're going to jam to Bastion. It was just like, it just seemed a little out of place. Uh, and that was my only issue with it, a sting in that song. I mean, Arkane is blown up right now.

288
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And I've heard nothing but great things about that show, no matter how you feel about legal legends. So I get that one as well. But then again, sometimes like the, what are these awards for games or media based on games?

289
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I think that's another, a good question to ask as well. Um, yeah. Uh, as soon as Matt says, I'm fine with having it in the pre-show because it's kind of like a technical awards, like what the Oscars do the night before.

290
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think it's actually about a week or two before, but I think you're onto something. I think there should be a more technical award focused thing. Like that pre-show should be spun off into its own, like maybe the game awards content creators or, or, um, the players or something.

291
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They did some of that. They did do like some awards during the pre-show, if I remember correctly.

292
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's where they blow through a lot of them.

293
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So like, it's not really a pre-show. It's just, it's weird. Um, my thing is that.

294
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They need their own daytime Emmys, Rob.

295
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, they do. Uh, my thing is that I think they need to, I think the audience is getting smarter and really figuring out that like, they're not mentioning that there are commercials.

296
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Um, and they're trying to pass off commercials as like trailers because of the way Jeff kind of will say, oh, and he'll kind of like talk about it.

297
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I think they should maybe look at doing something a little more traditional that, you know, when they, they pan out and say, and coming up after the break, we have performances by Imagine Dragons.

298
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And then when they come back from the break, it has like a, like, it should maybe look a little more like traditional TV in that regard.

299
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Um, I understand the show doesn't pay for itself and Jeff has to make the money somehow.

300
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Um, I just think the audience is starting to outsmart him a little bit and they're kind of seeing it for what it is.

301
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Uh, and that is, you know, paid, uh, spots. So I, I kind of think, yeah.

302
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, their thing with the content creator award is that they want it to be something anyone believes that they can win.

303
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But no one believes that they can win that for what it's worth. I am well aware I will never win it. And I'm at peace with that. You know why?

304
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Cause I got y'all in chat tonight. And even if, even if we aren't the number and those, you listen on the podcast feed well, even if we aren't the number one network on Twitch, the fact that even somebody listens to this, uh, who isn't directly a relative of mine or my co-host is pretty fucking awesome.

305
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So, oh, am I supposed to be listening to this? No, no, you listen to it live. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

306
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let's give the kids something to listen to and talk about the types of video games we have been playing this week. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? You're muted. Just so you know.

307
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I played dead by daylight and lots of it and lots of it played pinball. We, um, we finally got the animatronic of, uh, Grogu installed in the Mandalorian.

308
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, so we have, uh, Dan's buddy came up with that mod. So it's like using the little toy from target, you know, they were selling the animatronic toy.

309
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And it fits perfectly in the table and that's what all wired up. So when you're in that particular mode, it blinks and moves its little ears and does stupid child things.

310
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Cute. And if I thought the character was interesting or anything, I would be more excited about it, but Dan's really excited about it and it looks really cool. And it's a thing that his friend came up with. So.

311
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Cool. Cool. Um, I have a quick dead by daylight story for you that may crack you up. What did Debbie do this time? Cause I went up against a pig today.

312
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was my, it was my first match since I changed my name to Enya on steam because I just, I, you know, I, yeah, because I see, I see all these people like Cardi B or hex Britney Spears.

313
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I changed my name to Enya and I changed my profile picture on steam to a picture of Enya as well. So some of you that have me on steam are like, who the fuck is Enya? It's me.

314
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And it's just a funny dead by daylight joke because I've been into playing the artists lately. So I think that's kind of funny. And, uh, I I've been leveling Michaela who, and I also think that's, I think Enya kind of fits those. Yeah.

315
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah. Barista witch. So, so my first match is Enya. I go up against a pig and, um, somebody did.

316
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Did you think it was me?

317
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No, I didn't think it was you, but somebody, cause this, you know, my pig, this person, this person, this person was not great. And you've had a lot of practices pig. Um, but, uh,

318
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like the, the typical tunneling pig?

319
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:41,000
No, they just, they were really bad at chasing really bad. Okay. Um, so, um, everybody's got to start somewhere. I, you know, but here's the thing, somebody disconnected right at the start of the match because clearly they saw it was a pig.

320
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And so they disconnected and I'm like, eh, I can't, I can't really blame that. But like at the same time, I want out of this match, I want out of this match because I don't like to play after somebody DCs.

321
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm like, we're screwed. It's three versus one now. So, but I didn't want to just DC myself because I had a thing to empty toolboxes. So like, of course pig finds me, chases me, hooks me, bam, bam.

322
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I try to use my, uh, YOLO off the hook. Doesn't work. I go to second stage. I'm like, okay, I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to kill myself. And I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to say that on stream.

323
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm going to un-alive. Okay. And do all that. And then.

324
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You're going to, you're going to let, you're going to let Nia take you.

325
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah. Yes. I'm going to let Nia take me. So then, um, I'm talking about a video game. I think we all know that. So then somebody, uh, of course at the last second, unhooks me and I'm like, son of a bitch.

326
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I just, and then the pig started chasing the pig. No, well, the pig started chasing her for unhooking me. And I'm like, no, fuck you. Take me, take me.

327
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And so pig takes me down and leaves me for minutes and minutes and minutes. And so I was like, oh fine, fuck this. So finally I get picked up.

328
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So you just got plugged in left behind? Yes. Well, no, some, finally somebody picks me up. So I was like, fine, I'll play the game.

329
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We do gens and there's a snowman by the gate. Somebody gets hooked and I'm like, eh, fuck it. I hop in the snowman and hop out the gate and I got my frosty ice for trickster.

330
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Cool. I need to just start hitting snowmen. And I'm thinking about doing the bitchy thing and taking doctor into a match. Oh, anyway, I was so everyone will hate me and I don't care.

331
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm a Grinch. Bah, fucking humbug. All right. There's my dead by daylight story. I thought Jamie would enjoy cause it's a pig story and how I just said, cause pig is the best. Screw these survivors.

332
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Pig is the best. Like I actually was hanging out and to give my, one of my streamer shout outs for this episode is the pig.

333
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, I've seen that one around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it was my pig who best do gotcha. So, um, no, I knew, I knew it wasn't you cause I didn't get sent to RPD.

334
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't, I don't have any RPD offerings. Okay. All right. And the funny thing is now is that like ever since I did the old version of that build, right? It's now a thing that people do. People are calling it resident pig.

335
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, that's cute. I've apparently started something and no one knows I did it except for like a couple of people story of our lives here at orange launch radio. You should be used to this by now.

336
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Well, yeah, but, um, I have decided on something. Um, I've decided that my mental breakdown is going to be televised. I will be streaming every day during my medical leave except for the day I'm doing my sleep lab.

337
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
All right.

338
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
If you want to see me lose my shit at people, watch me stream.

339
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Well, if you see Enya, give her hatch. All right. Oh, I was going to say, I was going to say, I thought of the best name and I can't switch my names or I would do it since I'm on stadia, but you should do this sometime. Rob, do it for me. Okay. What's that?

340
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It should be hex N.

341
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, it took me a minute. Took me a minute. Oh, that's clever. Okay. I get it. I get it. Hex are like hex and then beyond heretic or something. See, he gets it. I like that. Someone had maximum overdrive last night and I was like, it's the eighties.

342
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:11,000
All right. I laughed so hard at that one. It's like that movie was terrible. You were there. I think. I think so. Um, it was an LC stream.

343
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Loki, let me go. Yeah. Uh, bonds double six and chat says Epic game store gave away dbd for a week. Oh yeah. We know you can tell. Well, yeah, we know. And you can tell in the game. How do you know? Uh, cause there's a lot of babies in the game right now, which is fine.

344
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Hooray. New players playing a game. I really enjoy that. Thank you for boosting my MMR, which I don't want it boosted any more than it is. It is noticeable. That's all I'm going to say. Well, you know how MMR works when you're a killer, right?

345
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yes. I considered a one V four it's for one V one matches. And that's why killer MMR shoots up when you get four Ks.

346
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Boy. Oh boy. All right. Terrible. We got to get to other games though. So let's go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

347
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's all Minecraft again. Um, so we started season two of nerd craft finally, cause I decided to host the server and, um, it's because, uh, the guy that runs it maxi-man is in an area where they've been hit with like some massive flooding and that

348
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
the tornado is back, back in the Southeast.

349
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, he's in Canada, so it was like way before all this, this is like last the end of the last month. Um, so they had a bunch of flooding that's knocked out, like a lot of the postal stuff there, but there's like a package that it's just out there floating in the limbo, um, with the server Ram.

350
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So I was like, well, it's just, I'll host the server. We can just do like a third party hosts and just do that. So we did that. And I've been just stressed out trying to get everything working. So, so we launched today and it's been a little buggy, a little laggy for some people.

351
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I kind of feel bad because the guy's supposed to be playing with couldn't connect today. Um, it's out of my control. I can't really make it less laggy for them. Uh, it's my connection has been fine. So he's closer to the server than I am too. So I don't know.

352
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But speaking of those tornadoes are real quick, just, you know, obviously I don't think any of our listeners were impacted by that. The only, the only person I know in Kentucky is a pod culture who I also see in chats in those tornadoes.

353
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Just miss my city. Thank gosh. Um, but I have a lot of friends in those areas. Oh, cause yeah, you growing up in Alabama, you probably know people that kind of relocated. They're all over there. So gosh, hope everybody's okay.

354
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Um, all right. Uh, anything else for your gaming week, Logie?

355
00:46:40,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Uh, no, that's it. Okay. Um, my gaming week. So unsurprisingly, I attempted to play more Final Fantasy 14. Unfortunately they haven't fixed the queuing problems, uh, in a week. Uh, so a lot of the same issues are still out there. So yikes. Um, but I have found if I try to start the queue around seven o'clock, I can get in by about nine o'clock, uh, literally on Friday night.

356
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I hopped in the queue, Alan and I went to dinner. Then we went to target. Then I got home and I'd been in the game for 15 minutes and I was about to get kicked in 15 more. So, uh, I was in the game. So we did all those things while I was waiting in queue. Most people can't do that cause they get kicked out of queue, but I've just noticed at night on the West coast, it seems to ease up a little bit. So I have more luck if I queue up at like seven o'clock and then try to get in the game by nine, but it doesn't leave me a ton of time to play.

357
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And I have friends, several that are like all the way through the story and it's, it's frustrating cause I'm like, I don't have the time to queue up first thing in the morning and these things, it's just like, I want to be where everyone else is at so I can talk about it and I can't because of these issues and it sucks.

358
00:47:48,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So, um, it is what it is, but getting kicked out of line, those issues are like my, even I love 14. I'm getting, my patience is wearing thin on those issues and they, they, they really got to figure. I'm fine with waiting in the queue as long as it's fair for everyone. It's not fair for everyone right now.

359
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And that's the part where my patience is starting to run real thin. So I, I hope they can figure that out for the sake of the game and being able to expand the community further someday.

360
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Um, but when I have played the game, I'm still enjoying it. There's a lot of cut scenes, a lot of stories, uh, for those that are familiar. And of course I'm not going to spoil. I'm just going to say I got past the first trial and a sequence of events that happens after that.

361
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:44,000
That's about where I'm at in the game. So I'm making my way through. Um, other stuff, my game week, I've been playing a lot of dead by daylight since I can't get into 14 after work. I've been playing more dead by daylight.

362
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I got Jonah up to like level 35. I got whatever talent I wanted from him. Now I'm working on Michaela. I've been playing Chris. I was playing on stream with some friends this week, had a good time. So just, just, you know, playing some dead by daylight.

363
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Uh, and then one other game I've been playing a little bit of this week. Listen up, Loki. I played Minecraft a couple of times. Yeah, I did. Cause you, you were saying go check out that new patch and you know, it was staring me in the face on Xbox.

364
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And I was like, all right, well, while I'm queuing up on my PC for a final fantasy, I need to play something. So I was like, I'll check out Minecraft. So I played and, um, I not good at it cause I was playing survival mode and I got killed.

365
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Like I made my little base and I tried to go to the mine, got killed really fast. I think I did that twice. And then finally I was like, all right, fuck it. I'll just play in peaceful mode. Let me live. Let me play the fucking game. God.

366
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So, um, I've been playing that too. I haven't loved any of the worlds I've spawned on. Uh, I keep getting these world spawns that are like, I spawn on the slope of a giant fucking Hill and I'm just like, what am I supposed to do with this?

367
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Like carve my way into the hillside, I guess, but it's not great. So, um, yeah. Yeah.

368
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I also wish the game would give you a little more prompting, like what to do. Cause I'm like, okay, I made a house. I guess I'll go in the mine and look for shiny things.

369
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then I'm like, am I doing this? Am I Minecrafting correctly? I don't know. Um, well, there is no right way to do it. I guess that's true. I have to remind myself of that.

370
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So, um, that's why maybe like survival mode feels like the things I should do because I'm like, oh, I'm leveling. I'm killing things. I'm surviving. That's the game.

371
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But then I actually die. And then I'm like, oh, I'm not surviving. So I don't know. We'll see. It's, but I, I'm enjoying it. I thought I would be more into it this time around because I've been playing so much No Man's Sky, which is also a crafting game and a building game in a way.

372
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I was like, oh, there's similarities there, but I don't know. I'm not, I'm not loving it as much as I love No Man's Sky, but maybe it'll grow on me. I have noticed that it looks different than it did the last time I played like from some of these patches or whatever it is that they've done.

373
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So yeah, they've changed. They've completely redone the world generation. So it is going to look much different. The biomes are much bigger. You have more mountains. And of course there's a larger, less mountains.

374
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well, no, it's what I'm saying is the, not necessarily less mountains and there's the, there are mountains, but it's not like all mountain. It's just the mountains that are in there are much taller.

375
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And so my, my seeds, my seeds have been, oops, oops, all mountains.

376
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That's yeah, that's unfortunate. Typically though, like it's not just like all mountains everywhere. Like usually you just had, apparently you've had some bad luck, but lucky you can get some like the seed I'm playing right now with nerdcraft.

377
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's mostly, it's pretty flat except for some mountains that are in there, but some of the caves though, like you're like walking over all this terrain and then all of a sudden you see this ravine and it's like, oh, this opens up into this giant cave system.

378
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Like, and I mean, Minecraft had cave systems before, but like nothing like this, like they're massive. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. I noticed the cave system is very different too. It's kind of interesting.

379
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It doesn't look, well, no, it even looks kind of different. Like they glow different. They have different biomes in the caves too. So like you'll have some that are like full of plants, some that have like slag tights and slag mites.

380
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And, um, you know, some of their full water, some of full lava. I thought that was a new thing, the stalactites. I was like, I don't remember that from before. And like the moss covered cave walls. I was like, oh, this is all new. It's neat.

381
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So there you go, Loki. I played Minecraft. Be proud of me. All right. I'm proud of you. Thank you. Thanks, Loki. It's all I ever, that's the validation I've always wanted. All right. Uh, let's get into some gaming news and talk about some other things going around on around the industry this week. We will start off with Loki.

382
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So I don't know what it is with game publishers and like doing the dump. I mean, I guess it's this, they sense that there's easy money to be made. So Ubisoft has launched a new service called Ubisoft Quartz.

383
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It is an NFT initiative, which allows people to buy artificially scarce digital items using cryptocurrency. People didn't like it. They've disliked the video announcement trailer quite a bit. Obviously, you can't see those dislikes normally because YouTube removed them for this very reason.

384
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But they have other technology that, you know, plugins that people use that where they can track that stuff. So people have been disliking the video. And also people don't really care for NFTs right now, probably because the NFT scene right now, what's happening with that is you have people that are making lots of money off of dumb things like pictures of hamburgers or whatever monkeys.

385
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And then you have like so many rug pull scams that are out there with NFTs. And it's just it's one other micro transaction now, like them getting into cryptocurrency and stuff like that. It's just, it's ridiculous. So it's just not a, I don't know, not something I'm interested in for sure.

386
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, but it's something that like it really looks like it's pretty terrible. And then also they had these. So Quartz is basically allows you to purchase these things called digits, which are in game weapons, vehicles and cosmetics, but they're limited. And so you can sell them buy and sell them on these markets actually make money.

387
00:54:46,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What I don't understand with this is remember, like, a while back, maybe because it's not loot boxes anymore or something, but like, remember a while back, like they ran afoul of all these like gambling laws, because it's like, Oh, well, they're like, Well, no, no, no, it's fine, because you can't sell these for real money. Well, now you can. So is that gonna run afoul of these gambling laws again, because it sure seems like that we're kind of treading in that territory again,

388
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:38,000
you, you, I just want to say real quick, you mentioned at the top of this, the thing that you're not sure why all these gaming companies are getting into this NFT and buy no money, it's well, it's and yeah, it's the investors, it's for whatever reason, for whatever reason, people, some people seem to think this is the future, and they are investing so much into this, I think this is where social media and some of the influence, it's very easy to influence on Twitter. Like, here's the thing.

389
00:55:39,000 --> 00:56:07,000
A lot of people don't tweet about NFTs, because then they know there's going to be 510 people that reply to their tweet, telling about telling them about how they're wrong for the following reasons. Like it's that type of automation that's happening on social media, that kind of shows that a lot of this is fake, and I think is artificially driving up this sort of like interest and demand and making people think there's demand for something that there isn't really demand for, because I still can't fucking explain this.

390
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:17,000
People have told me like what NFTs are and the blockchain, all that many times, and I still can't see here and go, this makes sense to me. I want to buy this.

391
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Think of it this way, what they're doing doesn't require an NFT at all. What they're doing is essentially like trading weapons and skins in Steam for CSGO, where you have a certain amount of items, digital items, say there's 500 of this gun skin, and you're just trading it back and forth with people.

392
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Now, you can do that in Steam without NFTs. It's because they have a system that just tracks that, like I don't see the issue. I don't know if they're like saying, well, you can take this outside of like this ecosystem and go trade it on marketplaces and stuff.

393
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I just think it's a lot of buzzwords to try to get the investors interested. It really is what it is. It seems like it's just completely unnecessary.

394
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Also, like, do you really want to buy like unique skins and stuff on the blockchain, like for large amounts of money for a game that's literally going to be outdated and useless in like a year?

395
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I mean, because that's how they do this with all these franchises. None of these games last a long time. It's not like actually it's not like CSGO where that's been around for years like this. They just recycle stuff all the time.

396
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Like, in Ubisoft, I don't trust them. I don't trust them at all to do this correctly. So, no, sorry.

397
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, Fifth Dream in chat says, cough, cough, blizzard in auction houses. People hated that but love NFTs. I don't understand.

398
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Quest Buster says, it's perceived value. I remember reading about NFT bros getting upset over people taking screenshots of rare NFT art and using them as wallpaper because they could.

399
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I don't get it.

400
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Right. Do you not know how the internet works? Like, if I could see a picture of it on the internet, I could take a capture, I can capture that. Like, it's, it's not a real piece of art. Like, I don't.

401
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That's why I'm surprised modders haven't made it so that these NFT items are everywhere yet.

402
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:39,000
They're probably working on them like a lot of this stuff like you know, like I said, we talked, there's one of the Paul brothers had like this thing that they use it was Adobe stock photos of animals, and they did really shitty photoshops to make them look like, Oh, look, see, it's a, it's a dog with wings.

403
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's like a Pokemon, buy our NFTs. And they made NFTs of that is like really cheaply, just no effort whatsoever done to try to make money. That's what these NFTs are.

404
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Some people like are actual artists that do sell their artwork online and they can make some money like that. The majority of the people are just making a quick buck off of things that they call art.

405
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But they're just like really shitty just little JPEGs or something like, no, thank you. I have no interest in getting that. And I have no interest, like you're not the sole owner of that piece of work.

406
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Can someone explain this to me? Okay. Mike Deaf says support artists, not NFTs. Yes. Fifth Dream says everyone is like, but it's decentralized, except if whoever's creating the NFTs or storing the NFTs or whatever, go poof.

407
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Who is there to provide any backing to this stuff? That's my question. Like, you know, okay, so you know, you have Bitcoin, which is like a type of crypto coin. And then there's all these other crypto coins that are similar, right?

408
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So you have, I don't know, Ethereum, you have the Doge and all these other coins that pop everywhere. So who's to say that like, okay, you have NFTs in this blockchain. Well, you know what? I'm going to make a new blockchain.

409
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And I'm going to call, it's not NFTs, it's FUTs. So we're going to, I'm going to sell these foots online. And it's the same thing. I'm going to sell the same thing, the exact same things, but you're in this.

410
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So you have the receipt in this universe. We don't recognize the other one here. That currency is Nolan Boyd. We only recognize foots here. FUTs. So how about that? What's to stop somebody from doing that?

411
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Aha, nobody has an answer. All right, let's move on. I'm a genius.

412
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
FUTs already exist and they already make tons of money off FUTs.

413
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Oh, do they? What is that? FIFA Ultimate Team.

414
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

415
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Yeah.

416
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Everybody in Bobby's like FUTs or FIFA Ultimate Team. Bobby says NFTs are bought with crypto. Well, I'll make a crypto too. How about it?

417
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Rob Roberts Fun Bucks. I didn't steal that from anyone. No, it's my own creation. Rob Roberts Fun Bucks.

418
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Someone's got Fun Bucks out there somewhere, Rob.

419
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You use it to buy FUTs. Well, these are Rob Roberts Fun Bucks. And you use it to buy. Actually, we're going to change the name. It's FUCs. You buy it. So you buy FUCs and it stands for, I don't know, I'll come up with an acronym later.

420
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And there's the special ones that fly and they're the Flying FUCs.

421
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Flying FUCs. Yes, exactly. So, uh, and Dark Soccer will sit here on the show going, I don't give a FUC. That's fine. You don't have to participate in the FUC if you don't want, but I'm going to have something that, you know what? It's really fucking cool.

422
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And let's put that on the shirt.

423
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Let's see how well decentralized platforms work too. There was one, uh, platform that just...

424
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Wow. Bond's 006 says, I just described NFT. So what's to stop me? What's to stop me?

425
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Let's go destroy a rainforest for the lols. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right.

426
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Fancy underground coins. Love it. I love it. Y'all are playing Acrophobia, one of my favorite games ever. All right. Uh, Loki, anything else you want to, you or Stella want to share on this story before we move on?

427
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
No, I had to pick her up because she fell over. She's gets disoriented sometimes.

428
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I love Stella.

429
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
She's been yelling at me all day long. Just like, just constantly. She's just like asleep.

430
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
On your arm.

431
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
DJ Rama S in chat says, Hey Rob, how many Travis Donovan fun bucks equal to one Rob Roberts fun bucks?

432
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Um, I would say one Rob Roberts fun buck is worth 69 Travis Donovan fun bucks. That's the official currency conversion.

433
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So there you go. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about something else that is clearly the future.

434
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Although this one, I actually somewhat understand a little bit, uh, and that is cloud gaming.

435
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So, uh, rumors picking up that Sony is looking to bring PlayStation now to phones. Um, and, uh, yeah, it's interesting because we also had this week that Microsoft has apparently been working on that too, but then kind of stopped somewhere along the way.

436
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well, the verge made a report this week that, um, uh, one of the documents from Epic games lawsuit against Apple, uh, basically said that the iPhone maker learned Sony was planning a mobile extension of PlayStation.

437
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Now in 2017, that would feature 450 PlayStation three titles. And then later on PlayStation four titles. Uh, and then of course it was mentioned again when Apple arcade kind of showed up, but a bus there's a whole lot of back and forth that just smoke shows.

438
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:35,000
There's a little bit of smoke that PlayStation now could potentially show up on phones and has been in the talks for quite some time. Here's the thing.

439
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Just last week or the week before on the show, I seem to remember there was talk about that, um, patent application that was filed for the PlayStation controller that kind of snapped on the two sides of the phone.

440
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And I was like, oh, that's probably for cloud gaming. Well, that sure lines up pretty well with this report that just came out this week. So I wonder if Sony isn't looking at doing something.

441
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And even if, you know, due to app store restrictions or whatever, they don't do an official cloud app. I still wonder if they don't do something where the mobile phone streams from the PlayStation five, or they can do things through the web.

442
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Of course we know is a workaround as well, which I think is what some of the other folks are doing. So I don't know. I thought that was kind of interesting. And I think, you know, especially again, after also last week, we had talk about, oh, maybe a pass that allows PlayStation one and PlayStation two games.

443
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:37,000
You have to wonder how much, um, uh, the, the cloud stuff is going to turn into that as well. So pass, you say a pass for games that they'll never work. Never, never work. I never heard of that before.

444
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Um, E3 VL and chat says, don't you guys have phones? Uh, we do. As it turns out, uh, fifth dream says PlayStation six will only be an app. You know, you joke, but how prolific is cloud gaming going to get over the next few?

445
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:10,000
We have a story later on tonight and I guess, sorry, I'm going to just kind of say, we're going to talk about a cloud gaming device that's built into televisions now, and it's not the only one. And so I think the question of how much longer does a game console really do what a game console does?

446
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I do think it might be kind of finite based on how fast can five G really go and how far out they're going to get away. Cause the big problem today is that like, you know, you can't stream games in four K in most places, uh, at a very clean looking, uh, sort of way.

447
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Um, but technology is going to catch up eventually. So, Oh, it's interesting. All right, let's move on. Uh, some sad news, dark soccer.

448
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah. So, uh, one of the legends of, uh, video gaming history who is, uh, Uemura Masayuki, the, the person behind giving us the, uh, NES and SNES, sorry, I should say the Famicom, the super Famicom, um, died.

449
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I was, uh, 78 years old, died, uh, this past Monday, which was, what day was Monday? I don't know what today is. Monday was the sixth. So, uh, but he was the same person that gave us, uh, both of those, uh, iconic pieces of video game equipment.

450
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Um, basically was told we need something that's going to beat Atari. And there, therefore the family computer came about. Um, he actually retired from Nintendo in 2004 to become the director of game studies at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. So rest in peace.

451
01:06:43,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And probably not a name that a lot of people recognize, because I don't think he was as heavily involved on the game ends of things as say, like, you know, well, yeah, I guess there was that. Um, but, um, you know, not the types of games that like, you know, Gunpei, Akoi or, uh, Miyamoto was involved with, but of course you don't have games if you don't have hardware to play them on.

452
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Um, so this is, uh, obviously is huge contribution to many of our formative years, uh, playing the NES and the Super NES, uh, which of course were the US versions of the Famicom, uh, which was a whole, the, the, the way that the Famicom and the NES were actually very different is still fascinating to me to this day.

453
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Like just how different those systems were, but of course, uh, we wouldn't have had it without, um, Masayuki Uemura. So rest in peace. Um, moving on to some more news, Loki.

454
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:45,000
All right. Actually before. Oh yeah. Do you know who else, do you know who else died like today? Uh, Anne Rice, right? Anne Rice, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just thought I would bring that up.

455
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And just a quick sort of FYI, by the way, um, it's, it's storming here in Northern California and the rain is at a point where I can hear it outside, which means there's a lot of it cause I don't usually hear it from here in the studio.

456
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So I just want to put that warning out there. If we suddenly go offline, there are storms in Northern California right now. Um, and I know everybody in OLR's history loved to joke about having a battery backup save thing.

457
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I actually have one of those now. Um, but it actually doesn't matter because ever since we switched to Twitch, everything is going up into the cloud as it were anyway.

458
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So, um, OLR doesn't get lost, but if it ends abruptly, I just want to put that out there. There is a storm going on right now and it sounds for California. It sounds like a pretty good one.

459
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I don't know if you guys can hear it, but I can certainly hear it outside right now. So, all right. Uh, next story, Loki.

460
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:45,000
All right. Um, so the ABK worker Alliance has announced that there's basically, um, initiation of there's basically striking.

461
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So they're encouraging their peers in the gaming industry to stand with them, uh, creating lasting change.

462
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And they're also doing a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign to raise money, uh, to basically kind of fight all this injustice that's going on.

463
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And they've raised quite a bit, I think. Um, it was over like $30,000. So it's not bad. Um, actually, oh, much more at $306,000 now. So, um, not bad.

464
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Uh, and then, yeah, it's just, it seems to be kind of escalating towards them actually forming unions. And to go along with that, the Activision Blizzard, um, higher ups have been sending out kind of union busting emails, despite the fact that they've been told not to do that.

465
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Um, and isn't it illegal? I believe it is illegal. Yes. Um, what companies union busting has been around forever though?

466
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah. So they've, they're asking them not to unionize to which I say, can't tell me what I want. Exactly. So I, yeah, especially if they're, they're getting upset now and they're, they're seem to be kind of, you know, really trying to push back again.

467
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That that's all the more reason I think to do it. It means you're close to what you need to get. I don't know. And if anything, you know, this is really just kind of spurred on by the fact that remember we had, was it last week or so where they laid off, you know, a third of the, um, the QA department.

468
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah. So it's just, it's only, it's only building, you know, stoking the fires of them trying to, I mean, which they really, of course, they're going to be working to try to get better, you know, benefits and better treatment at the company. So it's just, I don't know, it was an interesting move to try to do that in the middle of all of this.

469
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It could be the interesting thing that ends up being Bobby Kotick's legacy is that he inspired game developers to unionize finally.

470
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Yeah. So, um, I definitely not the end of this, you know, I think at some point we're going to hear that they're actually going to unionize.

471
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I think so too. I think after, because of all the crap that they've been through and the fact that the employee demands are still not being met, I think this does end up with them. I think that's where we end up.

472
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Um, I don't think it happens in the next month or next few weeks, but I think when we're sitting here six months from now, I think they unionize. I really do. Um, and I, uh, I think it's going to be a very interesting what happens from there.

473
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And then that's going to start a shockwave through the industry. So be very interesting. Yeah. All right.

474
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Well, I actually have to say that there is a lot, a lot more eyes, I think, on what's going on with them than he thinks that there are.

475
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And I think that there's been a lot, there has been a lot more pressure on the board members to, to get rid of them. So like a lot more in the way of, uh, uh, I can't make words happen petitions right now. So I think we're going to see something happen.

476
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I don't have much on my Christmas list, but I can think of one thing that I'd like to get for Christmas.

477
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And that is to report on this show that he is gone. That is sure. And a hippopotamus. All right.

478
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas. I already have a little mini hippopotamus. His name is Mr. Smoosh.

479
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Is that who was screaming in the background? Yes, he's walking around the kitchen screaming for no reason right now, except he probably wants food. Probably the storm outside too is probably driving him nuts.

480
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:47,000
All right. Yeah, he's fine. He is, he is not a poor kitty. He is spoiled to heck. All right. He's a, he's a spoiled kitty. All right, moving on.

481
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Uh, let's talk about Valkyrie Entertainment, uh, based out of Seattle was just recently acquired by Sony.

482
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Uh, Valkyrie has teamed up with, uh, several different companies, including Microsoft and Riot to help on games like God of War, Halo Infinite, Valorant.

483
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So, uh, the studios worked on those, uh, games, uh, before they were actually bought by Sony. They were working on God of War Ragnarok in conjunction with Santa Monica Studios, uh, for Sony.

484
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So, um, I guess not too surprised when you consider that, that Sony has, uh, decided to welcome them into the family.

485
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Uh, still very interesting. If you look at the last year, Sony bought Housemarque, Nyxis Software, Fire Sprite, Bluepoint Games, and now Valkyrie. 17 studios under PlayStation Studios.

486
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And certainly we think of that E3 a couple years ago when Microsoft came out on stage and was like, we bought that and that and that and that and that and that and that. Remember that?

487
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I want the world, I want the whole world.

488
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That was basically it. Phil Spencer came out on stage and said, I want to show you what I've done. I bought, I spent money, lots and lots of money.

489
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It would be just quicker if I tell you which studios they didn't buy, so.

490
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
When Valkyrie was one of them, because now they belong to PlayStation. All right.

491
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Um, let's go ahead and move on with another PlayStation story, Dark Sakura.

492
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yes. Um, so Sony Interactive, um, has allied their PlayStation brand with the family video game database, which, uh, parents used to learn about different video games so that they can navigate through what their children are playing.

493
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Um, the database was begun by Andy Robertson, who wrote the book Taming Gaming.

494
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Um, and so basically, um, the director of trust and safety at Sony Entertainment, Interactive Entertainment, uh, is on record saying the family video game database is a wonderful platform to help parents and guardians navigate the world of video games.

495
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And we were excited to come on board as its first corporate sponsor.

496
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So they're planning to expand the database so that it's easier to use for parents and make it a lot more accessible, uh, for people who need accessibility help.

497
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,000
They're also looking to also highlight games that have accessibility features and settings for making it better for everyone to use.

498
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:32,000
On average right now, it only gets about 15,000 visitors a day. And I say only because for a big site that's like this, that very much puts it in its early stages.

499
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:43,000
But it could be a good thing, especially if it's giving more transparency and truth in the games rather than, oh, the internet said this game was going to rot my kid's brain, her.

500
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense when you put it that way is that, you know, there is interest for Sony to get the facts about video games out there.

501
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I mean, I know, you know, we've, we've had this in the news lately where one of those tabloid television shows try to connect, um, a recent round of school shootings to a video game.

502
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Yeah. And it's a, it's a thing that plays out all too familiar. So of course that puts that narrative out there that like video games cause kids to, you know, turn into demons.

503
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And I think it's nice that PlayStation is investing in a company that maybe can put a little more truth out there to an audience that needs to hear it.

504
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So I think it's an interesting partnership. That's for sure. All right. Um, moving on next story, Loki.

505
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Yep. So kind of talking more about, uh, the whole unionization. So we have another company now bungee is actually having, uh, folks make that same kind of, um, you know, conversations as far as discussing, you know, unionizing.

506
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I think it's pretty much the whole industry is kind of looking at that at this point, but apparently, um, there is a report that was released talking about the workplace culture crunch hiring practices within bungee.

507
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And of course with that, there's dozens of the stories, um, of employees that bungee, um, current and past that we're talking about, you know, poisonous company culture and how the studio slow to make change.

508
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And, you know, crunch where, you know, you have folks working 60 to a hundred hour weeks.

509
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Um, it's just basically kind of pushing folks to look for change and the change that they feel, you know, at this point, their unionization is going to be the way to go as far as being able to ensure that change happens.

510
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Because leaving it up to leadership as is right now to make that change, even when it's been pointed out time and time again for years now and nothing's happening.

511
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So they need to take their action into their own hands.

512
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Basically, it definitely shows that there's a storm brewing and it's not just an Activision blizzard, but I mean, you know, again, this whole story about the, the toxic workplace cultures, uh, we're hearing it over and over and over again.

513
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And it's, you know, we're all getting fed up with it. So it's no, it's no surprise that all these companies are looking towards something like unionization to help with the issues and, you know, band together that we're not going to take this toxicity in the workplace anymore.

514
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, before we get to the classic game of the week, I have another story here about a real classic game, uh, Pac-Man.

515
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Um, so there's a new Pac-Man coming out. It's Pac-Man community, and it's a part of Facebook gaming, which, you know, I have a certain thought about that.

516
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But, um, Pac-Man was released on December 6th, and basically you team up in groups of four to take on ghosts while competing for the high score.

517
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You can also watch creators playing the game and interact with the person that's playing by taking control of Pac-Man and the ghosts from the AI.

518
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Um, so as much shit as I give Facebook gaming, that is a pretty interesting concept that I'm surprised Amazon, especially through, um, leveraging the Luna cloud and all that stuff isn't implementing yet, but maybe it's just a matter of time.

519
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And I think Stadia is kind of trying to get there. Um, but I'm not sure they really have that whole like hop in and play thing right now as it is, um, even if you're streaming to YouTube.

520
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Um, so, um, the other thing with this is that, um, I really feel like the Pac-Man brand has been so diluted the past few years. Like there's just a Pac-Man thing everywhere.

521
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:47,000
There's Pac-Man 99. There's that Pac-Man game that was on Stadia. It was exclusive to Stadia. Uh, there's now this, the Pac-Man community.

522
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I feel like they're, they're almost like licensing out Pac-Man to anyone that'll make a game. And I, I feel like they might want to be a little more choosy in what they allow out there.

523
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Now I haven't played this. I guess so they have, they definitely have Pac-Man fever. I guess maybe it's just dollars, dollars, dollars, sell it to whoever, whoever wants it.

524
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But I'm not sure all of these games really landed, uh, with a splash. Anyway, you know, Lord Zuckerberg had something to say about it.

525
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Who said in a post, uh, about, you know, Facebook gaming, gaming is a big part of the metaverse and I'm looking forward to seeing games like this get more interactive and immersive.

526
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And in a statement, Rob Roberts, a video game critic from his spare room had to say, you know, I'm really fucking sick and tired of hearing about the metaverse already.

527
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You know what, uh, what Jamie Summers, uh, uh, big egotistical bitch on orange on radio says.

528
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What did she have to say?

529
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Uh, that he can suck, he can suck it. He can take that hard and sandpapery thing that everyone says they can go fuck themselves with and he can shove it in other orifices.

530
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:10,000
There you go. Put that on the back of the box. All right. Uh, all right. Well, so we have the future with Pac-Man community, but maybe we need to take a trip back to the past in our next segment.

531
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Can we?

532
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

533
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And what is that classic game tonight, DarkDocker?

534
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:48,000
The classic game of the week is dragon age two. Yes. Dragon age two is old enough. It was released in duck.

535
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
No, just sigh that it's 10 years old.

536
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It came out in 2011. It is an action role-playing game developed by Bioware published by EA.

537
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It was the second major game that came out in the dragon age series, the successor to dragon age origins in 2009.

538
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You play a new character named Hawk, who can be a human, mage, rogue, or warrior of one of two genders because people were not as woke back then, 10 years ago.

539
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Basically, you go around killing things. Hack and slashing. With lots of story, lots of story, lots of story.

540
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And lots of romancing Fenris the whole time you play the game. Anyway, that's just me.

541
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So anyway, it began development during the time that the expansion to origins, which is awakening, was going through.

542
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And so they looked back at the feedback for origins and made the gameplay a lot more action oriented.

543
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:13,000
They improved the eclipse engine, renaming it to lyceum, had better visuals, better lighting, and had a new art style that was inspired by the movies Yojimbo and Conan.

544
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It brought back Mike Laidlaw, David Gator, and Einan Zor, back as lead designers, writers, and composers respectively.

545
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The game came out for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360s, and OS X March 2011.

546
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And it was basically considered to be pretty awesome. I mean, some people were like, oh, we like origins better. You changed it.

547
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I say whatever because I freaking love Dragon Age 2. Dragon Age 2 was really the one that brought me into the whole Dragon Age fandom.

548
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I played Origins and I did not like that your character didn't really speak and that just there were plenty of things that were clunky and cumbersome.

549
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I did though like the game, don't get me wrong, but I think that Dragon Age 2 was really the first step in making the series what it is.

550
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And so, you know, you can have a magic user. You have to watch your stamina. You can have a rogue, which I always played a rogue in this game.

551
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Without fail, I've played the other classes and I always preferred playing a rogue.

552
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And then of course you have your warrior type and you've got all kinds of different paths that you can take and your decisions affect the other characters in the game.

553
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Like for example, you choose which sibling lives and then if that sibling, if it's their brother Carver, then Carver can either become a templar or a Grey Warden or can die.

554
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And if it's Bethany, Bethany becomes either a... fuck, I always forget what the mages that live in the thing are called.

555
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You know what I mean though, right? When they lock up the mages.

556
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Yeah, but I forgot what it was called too.

557
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah, well anyway, she either gets locked up or becomes a Grey Warden or dies. Spoilers!

558
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Anyway, but the thing is that this had just so much better action. The dialogue options were less confusing.

559
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I wouldn't say confusing, but they had a better flow to them. There weren't too many repetitive items that were on there.

560
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I mean, this is the one that introduced the similar dialogue branches like we had from Mass Effect.

561
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So really, this and Mass Effect had a lot more in common in terms of gameplay.

562
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:15,000
It basically starts during the end of Dragon Age Origins and then goes back into the game being told from the point of view of Varric Tethras, who is a Rider who is also a Dwarven Rogue and he's also in Dragon Age Inquisition and Varric is awesome.

563
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And he's telling the story of Hawke and their adventures and who comes into the party and what happens depending on how things go and who gets romanced and blah, blah, blah.

564
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:45,000
But then you also get, there's other DLC, you get the Exiled Prince, so you get Sebastian who can, you know, go die in a bucket of his own piss for all I care.

565
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You also can get another bit of DLC that has Felicia Day as a character in it.

566
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And it's just, you even get like, you know, of course, cameos from people from the first Dragon Age series like Alistair shows up as one of different things depending on what his fate was in the first game.

567
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:20,000
He's kind of funny when he's drunk. Really sad, actually, but kind of funny too. He's always funny. Alistair's awesome.

568
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And like, Cullen comes back, which I was always very happy because in Dragon Age Inquisition, he becomes a romance interest, even though his voice actor is problematic.

569
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:48,000
But anyway, as far as the design goes, I mean, like I said, there were lots of influences going back to the works of Peter Bruegel, Sergio Leone, Akira Kousawa.

570
01:27:49,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It was a lot more stylistic because they had a lot more that they could do with it. The updated engine really allowed for a lot more processing in it.

571
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:11,000
For the record, I am not talking about any specific voice actor or else I would be talking about Gideon Emery, who everyone knows his voice the moment you hear it.

572
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Anyway, Dragon Age 2 had its co-development for both PC and console, while Origins was specifically meant more for a PC environment.

573
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So the controls are actually a lot more versatile. You could pick it up and play it with an Xbox controller and switch to a keyboard and mouse.

574
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I played it on my old PC. Actually, I'll take that back. I played it on Xbox and then I played it again on PC.

575
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And then when I played Inquisition, I stuck to playing it on a computer.

576
01:28:49,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But they realized that the problem was that in taking one made for a computer and then porting it to a console brought its own slew of problems, so why not just do them simultaneously?

577
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Rather than have these big, crazy origin stories, they wanted to keep some of the narrative because they thought that people reviewed the narrative, that it was way too predictable, too formulaic.

578
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And so they went to focus on one character over the course of years of the story rather than have these big, involved origin stories for all the players.

579
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So they were more inspired by Planescape Torment, which is also a fantastic game, to have Hawk fully voiced, which, again, great decision. I'm behind that.

580
01:29:48,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And then it was more of a reactive game, again, like Mass Effect. You don't know what your choices are going to lead to unless you play through it many, many, many times and romance the same characters over and over.

581
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? Anyway, there was also a lot of some crossover from Dragon Age 2. You got exclusive weapons if you ordered it.

582
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
There's also the signature edition that had new items, new missions, a new companion, a digital version of the soundtrack.

583
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:35,000
They worked with Razer for a periphery product called the Collector's Edition product line. There was a Facebook tie-in called Dragon Age Legends, which is a 2D RPG.

584
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Dead Space 2 got armor that was based off of Dragon Age 2 armor. I thought that the Blood Dragon armor was also available in Mass Effect 2, if I remember correctly.

585
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:05,000
But then for that DLC that had Felicia Day in it, there was also a mini-series called Dragon Age Redemption that she was in.

586
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It acted in everything. It was a web series. I watched the entire thing and I loved it.

587
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And then Mark of the Assassin DLC was where she came out as a guest companion.

588
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:25,000
The game got pretty good reviews. 82 out of 100 on average for Metacritic, except on Xbox 360 it got lower scores.

589
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Generally well above average scores. Really one of the better games. In fact, a lot of people said that what they really liked was the banter that went on between some of the characters.

590
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And that any backtracking that had to be done in the game wasn't considered monotonous, that it seemed like a different part of it.

591
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Some people were a little bit thinking that some of the areas were pretty limited, and I guess I could see the repetition in it.

592
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:09,000
But I honestly thought that they took everything that was good about Dragon Age Origins and Awakenings and they made it even better.

593
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:27,000
There was some controversy around this, where a BioWare employee was caught posting reviews as a consumer on Metacritic, giving it a 10 out of 10.

594
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And they don't know if he did it on his own as a fan of the game or if the company asked him to.

595
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:52,000
It was also criticized for using the SecuROM digital rights management software. Even though BioWare had said no, they only put that in as a release date checker that would delete itself after it was released.

596
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:15,000
They also were under fire for allowing same-sex couples in the game, and it was pretty disgusting that they were asking for that to be removed from the game.

597
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And Gator was like, no, this isn't going to be an inclusive game, and we're going to have it available for everybody, so screw you. He didn't say so screw you, but I said so screw you.

598
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And also that year, it outsold Pokemon Black and White worldwide and sold more than 1 million copies in less than two weeks, which was faster than its predecessor.

599
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:50,000
By May 2011, it sold over 2 million copies. There were tie-in novels, there was Dragon Age Asunder, and then of course the game Dragon Age Inquisition came out after that, which was amazing.

600
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And from the Legacy DLC, the villain from that, Corypheus, was the bad guy in Inquisition, and Hawk shows up in Inquisition as an NPC. So there you go.

601
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Lots of tie-ins to the other games, of course, and definitely a game that had an impact. Dragon Age 2, the classic game of the week, and I know one that Sakura spent a lot of time with.

602
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And in roughly two more years, I can do Inquisition.

603
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:33,000
All right, we'll be waiting. All right, there you go. Let's get into some rapid-fire news and quickly talk about some other news from around the industry, and I think we will start with Loki.

604
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yep. So, this is kind of funny. So they've been doing the whole interview circuit with the Matrix movies right around the corner, and Keanu Reeves, for some reason, was asked about folks modding Cyberpunk 2077 to have intercourse with his character in the game.

605
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And to which he thought, I know, that's of course the question that comes up.

606
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
It happens. If it's possible, it happens. Just going back to Dragon Age, I mean, I'm saying porn mods.

607
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, he says, explain that the dev had the mod banned, because they were not sure they had permission to do this, and I guess he reacted with genuine sadness.

608
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Basically, he's endorsing it. Oh my god, it's always nice when it's nice, and you know, Kerian Moss did not share that same sentiment, so please do not mod the Matrix Awakens demo to have intercourse with her.

609
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Noted.

610
01:35:50,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Noted, yes. And then, and then, you know, with the commercials and everything, Epic Games Store wants to let you know that they have a cutting edge technology called a shopping cart now. So that's right, you can purchase games more than one at a time.

611
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Wow, and the Epic Store has only been out for what, like five fucking years? Nobody would be...

612
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's technology that's so difficult to program.

613
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:37,000
If it were not for the free games and the exclusives, if it were not for the money they were throwing, they can throw all this money at free games and all this money at landing exclusives, but they can't throw money at actually creating a decent storefront.

614
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Blows my mind. Blows my mind. Nobody would be using that fucking store if it wasn't for the exclusives and the free shit.

615
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Maybe it's because people don't buy stuff off, people don't buy things that often from Epic Games, and so why do we need a shopping cart? I mean, they're just adding the free game that we give them each week, and that's about it.

616
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
You can add a bucket with holes in it.

617
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Yeah, and then what else? Oh, also you can review and remove items from the cart and move content to your wish list. You know, features that are on every storefront nowadays.

618
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Loki, what's next? Prepaid cards? Gift codes? Don't get crazy now.

619
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I know. Pie in the Sky type stuff here. Maybe they could partner with Nintendo and they could work some stuff out. Nintendo can show them the storefront stuff, Epic can show them networking things. Maybe it could be a synergy.

620
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I don't know. It sounds like a lot of interesting stuff going on in that kitchen.

621
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Maybe we don't have Nintendo show them their storefront because eShop is pretty terrible, so they're both screwed, I guess.

622
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:14,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Epic apparently wanted to do a skit at the Game Awards announcing the shopping carts, and Jeff said no. Good job, Jeff.

623
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:31,000
What? I mean, I know some of those announcements were a stretch, but wow, we added a shopping cart to our store. That's a real fucking stretch right there. Like, congratulations. Welcome to Amazon.com when it launched in 1997.

624
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Do they want praise for that? Like, should we...

625
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, please take us to a different topic.

626
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
How about Dead by Daylight? We talk about that none at all, right?

627
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
We never talk about that on this show.

628
01:38:50,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Heck no. So anyone who has Amazon Prime, if you go to gaming.amazon.com slash loot slash Dead by Daylight, you can get codes. Apparently, they're going to be doing a code every month for in-game content, and this month is two pallet swaps, really, of a new outfit for the artist, for Carmina herself.

629
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Who I've played for the first time today, and I'm really bad with her.

630
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'm not great at her.

631
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
But she's kind of fun. I like her level.

632
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah, I think she's a great design.

633
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
For friends in chat, I'm going to put the link in here. So there you go.

634
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And then Grand Theft Auto Online is getting a story expansion featuring Dr. Dre. Yes, and Chop the Dog is still around.

635
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I wish that the single players would get a story expansion, but I guess there's no money in that.

636
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Also, it's the return of Franklin. Franklin has to find Dr. Dre's phone.

637
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Unfortunately, people were trying to put Grand Theft Auto in their carts, but were unable to do so until this week, so they weren't able to sell the game, Loki.

638
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Speaking of the carts, I'm sorry, it's just too much comedy gold from chat.

639
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,000
As 200 Matt in chat says, they're working on GeoCities gifts and website view counts for their next update.

640
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Oh boy, I hope there's a Dancing Hamster website that Epic Games is about to unveil.

641
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Anyway, all right. By the way, on the Dead by Daylight thing, I can't remember if I caught you saying that, but I think I heard that it's six months, and this is just the first month.

642
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
That they're going to be giving away shit for like six months.

643
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

644
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
All right. If you do have the game, you should be logging in every day anyway to get your blood points.

645
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That's what I've been doing.

646
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I got up to gold four, finally, in Survivor. Yay!

647
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:51,000
That's ironic that you mentioned about logging in each day to get blood points, because that's how the metaverse works as well.

648
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
You have to log in each day to get your blood points. At least that's what they say.

649
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I'm still working on getting all of my base killers to their first round of 40 to get all their stuff teachable.

650
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Which I only have two left to go, and then I'm going to start prestiging... I plan on prestiging Pig and Freddy last, because I play them the most.

651
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But I'm going to start prestiging those fuckers I don't touch.

652
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Which killer would you be putting off because you hate them? I'm going to guess one of them is Trapper, because everybody hates Trapper.

653
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't mind Trapper.

654
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I did a cool thing with Trapper. I have to talk about this and no one is going to know what we're talking about, but this is really cool and you'll get it, Rob.

655
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Hurry up, because we have to get to Korea States.

656
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:43,000
You know in the Gideon plant where there's the big square hole that's just all by itself? I just put a trap at the bottom of it just for shits, and three people fell on it.

657
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I'm like, don't you people talk to each other? You're a fucking swiff. Anyway.

658
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Okay. Anyway.

659
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
That was smart, okay? That was smart.

660
01:41:52,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Let's get to our release dates around the world, and we'll start with the US. Loki, what's coming out in the US this week?

661
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Not a whole lot, but we do have things.

662
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:30,000
So, we have Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo on PC, Alien Isolation on iOS and Android, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate on PC, Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, The Gunk on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, and Record of Lotus Wars.

663
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Lodoss.

664
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Record of Lotus Wars, Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth. That's it.

665
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
That's the Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth thing, isn't that kind of an old thing?

666
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And that's also out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X. It's probably re-release or port.

667
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Well, I thought...

668
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Yes, it came out a while ago.

669
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I think it's based on one of the books.

670
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Well, the original game...

671
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It was on PC.

672
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And it's relatively new.

673
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Let's see here...

674
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
No, it came out earlier this year in PC.

675
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Okay.

676
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I thought it was something older. It might have been something based on one of the books, so I might have been mistaking it.

677
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Don't know.

678
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
All right, looking at Japan. A pretty busy week on the Switch in Japan this week.

679
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Death Smiles 1 and 2. It's in English, but it's getting a Japanese release this week on the 16th.

680
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Hashihime of the Old Book Town, also an English game being released in Japan this week.

681
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,000
That same Record of Lotus War, Deed It in Wonder Labyrinth, is also out on in Japan this week.

682
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
As is LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and Among Us getting a retail release.

683
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Pui Pui Molcar. Let's Molcar Party.

684
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I don't know what a Molcar Party is, but that is coming out in Japan this week.

685
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Also on the Switch. And that one is getting a collector's edition with that as well.

686
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I'm trying to see what this is. It looks like they're chibi little animals like hamsters and sheep.

687
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And what are they doing? Are they just playing dress-up?

688
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
It looks like they just play dress-up in this game.

689
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
But it looks cute. It kind of looks like Little Big Planet, but with animals.

690
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And it's a bunch of mini-games. Oh, it's a mini-game collection type of game.

691
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Oh boy. A price reduction on Earth Defense Force World Brothers and Monster Hunter Rise

692
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
as they are re-released into best hit style collections.

693
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And that is pretty much all you get on the Nintendo Switch this week.

694
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Looking at the PlayStation 5, that Among Us Crewmate Edition is out on PlayStation 5

695
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
as is that Record of Lotus War that was brought up earlier.

696
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So there's your Japanese releases. Dark Sakura.

697
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Three things. Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy, the definitive edition on the 14th.

698
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Among Us Crewmate Edition also on the 14th. And on the 17th, Disney Classic Games Definitive Edition.

699
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
There we go.

700
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:01,000
DJ Rama S, by the way, with the information here, the Lotus War game is already out, but it's being released in physical form.

701
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And that does happen sometimes. And that is probably the same thing with the Among Us release

702
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
because E3VL says what's in the Crewmate Edition. It probably is a retail release

703
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
and it probably comes with like, I don't know, hats or whatever they put in there.

704
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's like DLC. There's probably a few of those. So that's probably what, you know, it's a retail release

705
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
because, you know, if grandma knows the kids love Among Us, then they'll probably buy it

706
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:33,000
to put under the Christmas tree or the Hanukkah bush or whatever it is in the home later this year.

707
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So, all right. That's it for release dates. Let's go to some more stories.

708
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Oh, Loki, I feel like we're back to where we started, aren't we?

709
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah, yeah. So, you know, just when you think that, yeah, you know, you're just wondering,

710
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:58,000
what is Peter Milano doing? You know, I'm sure he's got some cutting edge thing that he's trying to push,

711
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:04,000
you know, whether it's a dog, a boy, a cube. Oh, no, it's NFTs.

712
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:13,000
So he has a blockchain business sim featuring NFTs and it's his game called Legacy.

713
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And, yeah, I'm sure he's hyping the heck out of it. But like, we've we have to have known by now

714
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:32,000
that, like, we can't trust anything he says. Like, it'll never be good, I guess, or at least as good as he says.

715
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And the game looks like a cheap mobile game. So, no thanks.

716
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
You know, it's tough because I enjoyed black and white. I enjoyed Fable.

717
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I even tried that what's in the cube thing because I thought it was kind of interesting.

718
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
But I've got to admit, I'm at this point where, you know, Peter Milano and he gets up there

719
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
and he talks about this and all I hear is blah, blah, blah. And honestly, I just don't give a fuck.

720
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I just don't give a fuck. I don't.

721
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Dark Sakura, do you give a fuck?

722
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Huh?

723
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
About Peter Milano's latest NFT project? Do you give a fuck?

724
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Fair enough. All right.

725
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Nintendo Entertainment Systems, I give a fuck about that.

726
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Quest Buster says there's also that goddess game. Oh, yes, there was though.

727
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That was a big member that. Oh, God, there's so many things wrong.

728
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I remember there was one thing like wasn't like a contest or something like that where someone got the run part of like they got to make decisions about the game.

729
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And that was what was in the cube. That's what was in the cube.

730
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
What's in the cube? The Kickstarter. Remember that?

731
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Bobby Blackwell and Chad says the thing about Peter is that he truly believes in what he's doing and he is genuinely excited about it.

732
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Well, I'm glad someone is.

733
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And that's how he gets in trouble because he gets too excited and talks too much out loud too early.

734
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Oh, yes. Ask ask that guy from Hello Games how that went for him.

735
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
All right. Moving on.

736
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Let's talk about Stadia because Stadia is baked in now to LG TVs.

737
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It was supposed to happen a while ago. It was held up for whatever reason.

738
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:21,000
But anybody that has an LG set that is running Web OS 5.0 or 6.0. So it has to be 2020 model or newer.

739
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
You can now use Stadia so you can play the games that are on Stadia such as Dark Sakura plays her beloved Dead by Daylight there.

740
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
But you will have to, of course, have some sort of controller. You could use the Stadia controller.

741
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
But you can get common console controllers to work to either wirelessly or through USB.

742
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So if Dark Sakura had an LG TV, she could pick up where she left off from her Mac and play on her TV.

743
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Although I'm sure Dark Sakura is like, why would I play with the controller? And I get that.

744
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
But if you wouldn't mind going back and forth, this is an option for you as well.

745
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
So, yeah. And, you know, I was going to bring this up now if I hadn't already earlier.

746
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:07,000
But it kind of goes back to the talk about will there even be a game console 10 years from now?

747
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I mean, I'm sure there will be, and I'm not trying to be one of those things that's like cloud gaming is going to take over everything.

748
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Because I think there's always going to be a space for that physical copy as well.

749
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:29,000
But will it be as prolific? Will it be that same split, especially when you look at, again, movies and TV where a lot of gaming has taken its cue?

750
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It's not to say the Blu-rays are done for and gone. They're not.

751
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:43,000
But you know what's taking up a lot of the conversation? Netflix, Hulu, Paramount Plus, Amazon, et cetera, et cetera, when it comes into that space.

752
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
So I do think it's kind of a matter of time with this cloud gaming stuff. It's just the gaming's got a little more going on than TV does.

753
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,000
And so they have to wait for the technology to catch up. But for simple games, it sure seems to work pretty well.

754
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And even more complex games like Dead by Daylight, I don't hear Dark Sakura bitch about the experience. It seems to work quite well for her.

755
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
It plays great to me. You do need good internet for it, but it plays fine.

756
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Right. So as Joan Hunter-Matt says, I just bought a new LG TV. Maybe I'll try it someday. Yeah, let us know.

757
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I'm pretty sure there's a couple of games that are free just if you get in there so you can kind of test it out with.

758
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Like Destiny was at one point. I don't know if it still is. And it was DTRMS says which model LG TVs? It has to run WebOS 5.0 or 6.0. Not 4.0 def, sorry.

759
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And it has to be, I think that was a 2020 or newer model. So if your TV is a couple of years old, sadly, it probably won't work.

760
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
But all the more reason to get a new TV. Just kidding.

761
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Okay, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

762
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So there is a twin stick game called Bulk Slash and finally it has an English fan translation.

763
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:11,000
So yeah, you can use your Saturn twin sticks to play this game. It's got dubbed voices, all English menus, all of the dialogue, everything has been translated.

764
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:22,000
So you can now play an SDF fighter pilot with other people who get to kill things with their mecha.

765
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
There you go. We love to see English translation patches for games that are many, many, many years old.

766
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Especially Sega Saturn stuff.

767
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Yeah, I thought you'd like that news.

768
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Yeah.

769
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
All right. Loki.

770
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:48,000
All right. And then we've been covering the lawsuit between Nintendo and Bowser.

771
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
There's so many Bowsers out there, but this is Gary Bowser, who was part of Team Executor.

772
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And they've agreed to a settlement now of $10 million in regards to his company selling the hacking tools or mod chips for the Nintendo consoles.

773
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So that's a lot of money. Hopefully he made a lot of money from all that.

774
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I can't imagine paying $10 million back. File for bankruptcy?

775
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
$5 a week? I don't think he does.

776
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I don't think he does. I think that's the gag.

777
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
So, Dr. Seuss says, I mean, you'd think he would want to stay off Nintendo's bad side.

778
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Yeah, he hasn't really been doing a good job doing that.

779
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:45,000
He kind of has to because there's a permanent injunction against him worldwide, you know, without regard in territorial scope of specific intellectual property rights asserted in the complaint.

780
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Basically, he can't do any more circumvention of their copyrights.

781
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:01,000
All right. And one more story for you guys. And this is going to make you feel really old.

782
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Well, maybe not. I don't know how many of you are over the age of 45.

783
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Okay, one of us is. But here's the thing.

784
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Well, Dark Sakura, you're in good company because the Fairchild Channel F turned 45.

785
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Of course, it was one of those early, early consoles that was released.

786
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:33,000
This 1972 was the first console, the Magnavox Odyssey, and the 1976 brought us the Fairchild Channel F.

787
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So that was one whole year before Atari.

788
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
But did you ever have a Fairchild Channel F?

789
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Dan did.

790
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And the Fairchild Channel F was notable because it used cartridges, right?

791
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So we've talked about that in the past on the show is that, you know,

792
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
modern gaming was created from the Fairchild Channel F.

793
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
A designer of color.

794
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Yeah. And of course, you know, that was one of the big legacies that Fairchild brought to the table.

795
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Of course, their own developments were soon kind of taken over by Intel and Zilog and all that.

796
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
But it still made its mark.

797
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:21,000
The Fairchild had an 8-bit processor inside of it and 64 bytes of RAM.

798
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Not 64K, 64 bytes.

799
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Needless to say, that's a lot to cram into the read access.

800
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
It had a palette of eight colors and the resolution that it could output was 128 by 64.

801
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That was the resolution it could output.

802
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,000
There was also an internal speaker on this thing and that was not great.

803
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Later models, however, used the TV speaker, but the Fairchild never really super caught fire with that.

804
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Some of the games that were released, things like Alien Invasion, Pro Football, Checkers, and so on.

805
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:09,000
So just a reminder of the Channel F, which admittedly I never played one because I missed it growing up.

806
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
My first console was Atari and I think I had a friend with an Intellivision.

807
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I knew of an Odyssey, but I never played one myself.

808
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I had a lot of gaming books that would talk about them.

809
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And I think I even had some that talked about Fairchild F, but I never really played one.

810
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
You know what I had?

811
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
You had an Odyssey.

812
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Oh no, I didn't have the Odyssey. My friends had the Odyssey, too.

813
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I own an Odyssey now.

814
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
But I had the TI-99 4A.

815
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And I had the ColecoVision.

816
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yes, yes. So many systems back then.

817
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I still have my ColecoVision.

818
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:50,000
It's so interesting to think about now how like, oh gosh, there's the Nintendo Switch and there's this Xbox and PlayStation.

819
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
That's a lot. And then there's PC and Stadia.

820
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And then it's like, okay, go back to the early 80s.

821
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:03,000
It was like the Atari 2600, the 5200, the 7800, the Commodore 64, maybe the Commodore 128 or the Amiga.

822
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Or maybe it still ran on a VIC-20.

823
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
And then there was the TI-99 4A. There was the ColecoVision.

824
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I mean, you get the point. There's just the early IBM PC Juniors and all this delay.

825
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
It just goes on and on.

826
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
There's just so many freaking consoles back then.

827
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I used to love those ads that would show like the Parker Brothers Frogger game.

828
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
And it would show nine different screenshots from all the various consoles.

829
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Commodore 64 and everything else that it would play on.

830
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
So, yeah, just awesome. Anyway.

831
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
All right. Now is the part of the show where you get to have a say.

832
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Oh, of course, you've been chatting with us all night.

833
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
But even the folks listening on the podcast feed, you can always send us an email.

834
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

835
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
And if you want to give us a call, you can also hop into our green room on our Discord server.

836
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I still need suggestions, by the way.

837
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
For, remind us?

838
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
For classic, whatever, whatever.

839
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
For the classic blah-de-blah in 2022. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Oh, thank you. Bobby points out from his last show, the Arcade 1UP Tron video was uploaded to our YouTube channel.

841
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And if you're not on our YouTube channel, I can't say I blame you because we haven't added a lot.

842
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But there are some things on there worth looking at.

843
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So, VOG Network. If that isn't the most honest plug for a YouTube channel.

844
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
It's all right. I mean, there's a few things there.

845
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,000
You should check it out. VOG Network on YouTube as well. So, be sure to check that out.

846
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Did we have any emails, Dark Soccer? I didn't, don't remember seeing any. Okay.

847
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Well, y'all flopped, but that's okay. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

848
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:51,000
You know, we've had a rule here historically that when we don't get any emails, then you are basically asking Dark Soccer and I to talk about Drag Race.

849
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
But I have to admit, I haven't, I don't watch all these international spinoffs.

850
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Like, that's how I get tired of Drag Race real fast. So, I found a fun username.

851
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
On one of the Twitch chats that made me laugh.

852
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Okay. What's that?

853
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Pandora's lunchbox.

854
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Oh, that's pretty good. But I mean, Pandora box wasn't just a drag queen.

855
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And you know this, of course, but you know, it's, it, the name is funny because it ties into, you know, ancient, ancient stories.

856
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yeah. And all that stuff. So, who's to say that comes from the drag queen, but it might, you never know.

857
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
So, all right.

858
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
All right.

859
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Oh, Ongina was doing a charity stream earlier today.

860
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh, yeah. I thought I followed her, but I don't see that. Maybe I'm not following her.

861
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,000
And, and I, I got asked that if I ever play survivor, that Ongina will let me play with her.

862
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Oh, that's fun. You should.

863
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
One day. If I ever decide to break out survivor cherry.

864
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Break the ice. Get it over with.

865
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Ugh, I need people to teach me.

866
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:59,000
You, you're already learning by hunting them, but yeah, I mean, I'm happy to, I'm happy to hop on voice chat and yell at you.

867
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:08,000
All these people are like, oh, oh, you'll be a better killer if you play survivor. I'm already a better killer watching survivors. I know your tricks.

868
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
That's true. You learn a lot watching other people, but because before I was playing that game, of course I watched a lot of Twitch.

869
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:23,000
And I think this goes for almost any game, uh, watching people on Twitch, uh, gives me the most honest reviews and honest takes on any game.

870
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Like when I was kind of trying to decide, do I want to do New World or do my just going to stick with Final Fantasy 14 for now?

871
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Like watching Twitch streamers was a big part of that. And I will say New World did look fun, but you know, I'm kind of in bed with Final Fantasy 14 right now.

872
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Although I don't know, sometimes these queue times, but I'm, the problem is I'm paid through February because I play, pay three months at a time.

873
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
So it's like, well, I'm stuck with it now. So there is that. All right.

874
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Well. Yes. Well. Well, Wells are, I'm not going to play New World. You don't have to, nobody's going to force you to.

875
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I'm also on a Mac. Oh, is it not on? I can, I can never remember what is and is.

876
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I think I'm kind of over the idea of playing a colonization game. The theme is problematic.

877
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Uh, but I don't want to chase turkeys like all, like all of our friends do.

878
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Final Fantasy 14 is on a Mac. There is, I know I play, I play that. I'm not touching that until that shit storm has calmed down.

879
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I can't say I blame you. They're talking about opening. Like if they open new servers, I was trying to remember what the last update said, and I think they are still trying to open new servers.

880
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:47,000
And we're kind of at the point where we might jump ship and do it. And like, there's a part of me that kind of doesn't want to, but also I'm kind of like, why did that gigantic wow streamer who's getting all the media attention.

881
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Who decided to try Final Fantasy 14 and stick with it. Why did he have to pick the server I'm on and now cause all these Q issues to be exacerbated?

882
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I tried to join a random one and it put me right back on Midgar Samar.

883
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Oh, interesting. So I just played my old character. Why not? Hopefully it won't matter. Level 70 right now.

884
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
That's it. That's the other reason why I'm open to server hopping somewhere. It's not going to matter soon. It was 6.1. You're supposed to get the cross data center play.

885
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Hopefully, hopefully all this other stuff doesn't screw all that up, but we'll see. All right. Let me check in with any last minute stories from Loki or otherwise.

886
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Nope. Got nothing. I know it was pretty slow week in the news. Other, well, I mean, we taught, I mean the game awards, I shouldn't say it was a slow week, but I feel like outside of that, there wasn't a lot, a lot, a lot going on, but that's typical of this time of year.

887
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, um, yeah. Pretty much winding down. Yeah. I understand. All right. Well, I think this show will wind down as well then and we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but I want to thank you guys for participating with our show tonight.

888
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Whether you were here live with us on Sunday nights over at VOG Network, or if you are participating with our podcast, thank you very much for being a part of the show. Appreciate it.

889
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:10,000
A word of mouth goes the long, goes a long way. You know, we, we don't ask for your money, but we do ask you to tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice and we want more voices at the table.

890
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Um, so, you know, a nice tweet or a share on social media goes a long way. Uh, you can also tweet us by the way, at OLR. I read them all, even if I don't read them on air. Um, but I appreciate it. Sometimes I respond to them.

891
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Um, and, uh, yes, there's Twitter at OLR. One of the few Twitter accounts now that has under four because we've grabbed that name along to, they don't let you make names with under four letters anymore. So we have a, we have a valuable Twitter account, I suppose, at OLR.

892
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Um, and the problem is we get tagged with other things that have the acronym OLR. Like there's some school. So how dare you dare. Yeah, I know. Right.

893
02:02:46,000 --> 02:03:04,000
It's our acronym. It's our acronym. Um, anyway, um, we still don't have a store yet. Hoping that'll be resolved in the next couple of weeks. So sorry, this limited edition shirt I'm wearing. Uh, we don't have another one yet, but hopefully soon. So, but our soccer has a store. She'll let you know that.

894
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:20,000
All right. Um, that is it. Uh, join our discord, vognetwork.com slash discord, and we can continue the conversation throughout the week. Um, thank you again for being here tonight and, um, yeah, we'll be back in seven days to do it again, of course, with whatever

895
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:28,000
news should come up in the next week. And of course, now I need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. So Dark Sakura, I don't know if you're, you're still streaming tonight, right?

896
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I'm going to go for it. I'm pretty tired, but I'm going to try to do it for a little bit. I guess I'm going, going live early.

897
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Yeah, I know we kind of wrapped earlier, but hey, that means I'll be done early. All right. I just dreamed for three hours, so we'll see. All right.

898
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So, uh, any final thoughts before we let you go?

899
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Um, I have managed to fall prey to Whamageddon, which I don't mind because I actually like that song, but I'm still free of the Moriah apocalypse.

900
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I saw an interesting take online where somebody was like, I don't do the Whamageddon. I celebrate Whammas or something where I try to hear that song as many times as possible because it's a good song and y'all should stop hating it.

901
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I thought that was a neat way to look at it.

902
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I do though have to thank Joe for warning me before playing that song so I can mute the stream.

903
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Because I think, I think he was honoring my five year Moriah free holiday season.

904
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Noted. All right. Thank you. All right, Dark Soccer. Have a good stream. Thanks for being here.

905
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I'm out. Bye.

906
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
All right. Uh, Loki, we'll go to you next with your final thought.

907
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Uh, my final thought is I've done a lot of random early game stuff in Minecraft today and I had to figure out how to make that into an episode.

908
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Oh, maybe a, uh, off season episode or something, a special episode.

909
02:04:45,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Well, no, no, it's, it's in, in season. It's just, uh, it's like, there's not really much structure there because a lot of stuff I did, I did off camera because it's not fun to watch someone just branch behind for a long time.

910
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
So, yeah.

911
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Um, I'm going to keep trying to play Minecraft so I can guess on one of your guests on one of your YouTube someday. It'd be fun.

912
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
All right.

913
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Yeah. Anytime.

914
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Uh, and that's, that's it. I don't have a lot of final thoughts. I'm just gonna, I just need prayer circles that the, uh, Final Fantasy cues get better this week so I can finish the story because I've already been spoiled thanks to a Google news headline of all places.

915
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So, uh, a big F you with the week to click bait websites that post articles in the headline that have major story spoilers.

916
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Um, and F you to Google news for knowing that I like Final Fantasy 14 and showing that to me. Uh, so F you to those things. Uh, I guess that felt good as a final thought to bring back the F use the week because that was on my mind.

917
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Uh, otherwise I'm in a pretty good mood, so we'll see you guys in seven days. Thank you guys very much for being here. Have a great week. Thanks for being a part of orange launch radio. We'll see you next time. Good night.
