0	15280	It's the end of the year, and all through the net, money was flying, fortunes were set.
15280	19520	But some gaming execs who were told of this bet, they weren't to cash in, but pushback
19520	20520	was met.
20520	22760	This topic is boring, but the news now is light.
22760	25560	Ignoring it is detrimental, so we'll discuss it this night.
25560	27920	I typed up this intro, reciting it by sight.
28160	31040	It's not iambic pentameter, but it gets the job done right.
31040	32040	It's time for the show.
32040	36280	Orange Lounge Radio begins with your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to talk
36280	38600	gaming topics herein.
38600	45160	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45160	47360	where every gamer has a voice.
47360	52960	It is another episode of Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 897 of our show
52960	56900	for this December the 26th of 2021.
56900	60040	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined by my co-hosts.
60040	63700	First off, I want to give a special shout out to our voiceover guy, Jason, for that
63700	64700	intro tonight.
64700	66860	He deserves a Grammy for that, just saying.
66860	70980	But also say hello to my co-hosts, who probably also deserve a Grammy, because what does a
70980	72380	Grammy really mean anyway?
72380	74980	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
74980	76500	I could use a gram of something.
76500	80020	Hey, do you know what today is, Dark Sakura?
80020	81020	Boxing day.
81020	85740	It is boxing day, but it's also, more importantly, my half birthday.
85740	87860	So happy half birthday to me.
87860	88860	So there you go.
88860	90980	I'm 43 and a half today.
90980	93500	So that's like, what, four, three, one, two.
93500	96660	It kind of sounds like it's like an Intellivision release date that they're going to miss or
96660	97660	something like that.
97660	98660	I don't know.
98660	99660	Just the numerology thing.
99660	100660	So there you go.
100660	101940	Birthdays, aren't they fun?
101940	105420	Say hello to Forever Young tech master Loki, also joining us.
105420	108540	Well, you know, I don't know.
108540	110260	They can keep making updates.
110260	112540	It's kind of like how they predict the end of the world.
113300	117580	You know, they'll throw dates out until eventually one of them make it OK.
117580	123100	What comes out first in television, Amico or the apocalypse, the Mayans predicted?
123100	124100	Which first?
126100	128460	Or Trump is reinstated as president, you know?
128460	129980	No, no, no, no.
129980	131660	I keep throwing out stuff.
131660	135980	Or what is the banned phrase on the show or that JFK is going to come back or something
135980	136980	like that?
136980	138580	Like, that was the other one.
138580	139580	But yeah.
139620	140620	All right.
140620	145100	We're going to get into our kickoff topic in a minute.
145100	147260	We're doing something a little different for our kickoff topic here.
147260	151020	But first, Dark Sakura, we've got to talk about the holiday.
151020	154220	I hope everybody out there had a great holiday.
154220	158660	And whether you celebrate Christmas or not, because Dark Sakura, I know you don't really
158660	162740	celebrate Christmas, but what you I don't know, I don't put the word to mouth.
162740	164220	You celebrate presents, presents day.
164220	166180	I don't celebrate it as a religious holiday.
166180	167180	I got you.
167780	171340	There's certainly plenty of people that are like that, but I think there's certainly plenty
171340	178100	of people where it's like, Christmas is kind of a, it's about Santa and lights and Frosty
178100	181820	the Snowman, but not, you know, that's what it's about for them.
181820	186340	But anyway, my point is, is that it's also about getting together with people you like.
186340	191260	And so Dark Sakura and I, or sometimes don't like, but in my case, it was people I like,
191260	195720	Dark Sakura and I hung out yesterday on the said holiday.
195720	196900	And that was fun.
196900	201180	So I just want to say thank you, Dark Sakura, and publicly embarrass you for having us over.
201180	206020	Because for those that don't follow my Twitter feed, my original Christmas plans with family
206020	207020	got screwed up.
207020	212180	And I'm not going to get into the details on the show, but there's somebody irresponsible
212180	213180	in my family.
213180	214180	It's not me.
214180	215180	That's all we're going to say.
215180	217700	And they managed to screw up Christmas plans.
217700	221320	So Alan and I were kind of left without something to do.
221320	224500	And so I was like, what's Dark Sakura doing on December 25th?
224820	226540	And she was like, come over, come over.
226540	227540	Let's have pizza.
227540	228540	We'll have fun.
228540	229540	Play pinball.
229540	230540	And it was.
230540	231540	We had a good time.
231540	232540	And that happened.
232540	233540	Yes.
233540	234540	Exactly.
234540	241660	I have to say I was really proud of myself that me in height of lack of medication managed
241660	242660	to keep.
242660	246980	I only forgot how to say words I think three times the entire night.
246980	249260	You were extremely normal last night.
249260	251840	So for what it's worth, is that a compliment?
251840	253260	It's supposed to be.
253260	255220	Well, it's been really hard.
255220	260060	I have to say that unmedicated Jamie is a lot bitchier than medicated Jamie.
260060	262420	That's not an agreement.
262420	263420	It's a huh.
263420	264420	I understand.
264420	265420	Yeah.
265420	266420	Yeah.
266420	272460	It's I'm glad I only have like another week to go of this because my test is on the fourth.
272460	273460	You got this.
273460	274460	You got this.
274460	275460	Yeah.
275460	276460	Going to some.
276460	277460	It was me normal.
277460	281460	Just go into some comments and chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the
281460	286660	voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network at nine o'clock Eastern six p.m. Pacific
286660	291740	right after the Bobby black will show again that's twitch.tv slash vog network VOG network.
291740	295220	But of course, we're available on demand in many podcast apps.
295220	299580	I want to say at the start of the show, Spotify for Christmas, which I know a lot of people
299580	304080	use that to listen to podcasts, just added podcast ratings.
304080	307820	So for you Spotify peeps, I know some of you are Apple podcast peeps, I know some of you
307820	310020	are like Google Play podcast.
310020	311680	For you Spotify peeps.
311680	312680	Do me a favor.
312680	315460	Do me a solid go in and rate five stars for orange launch radio.
315460	316460	Much appreciated.
316460	317460	Mwah.
317460	318460	Okay.
318460	319460	Just want to get that up at the top of the show.
319460	325140	Now to some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network e3 vl was suggesting Half Life
325140	326140	three.
326140	327140	What happens first?
327140	328140	The Intellivision amico or Half Life three.
328140	329800	That was a good one to throw in there.
329800	334060	Bobby Black Wolf talking about Christmas saying I celebrate the secular marketing holiday that
334060	335540	is on December 25th.
335540	336540	Bingo.
336540	343300	Um, let's see, um, Sia Tabiri says Christmas is the day of rest after jingle visits.
343300	347100	I believe that is an animal crossing reference, right Jamie?
347100	349220	I still haven't touched the upgrades yet.
349220	350220	Oh, bummer.
350220	351820	We got to get into that.
351820	357300	Um, and, uh, Bobby Black Wolf kind of referencing, uh, my time spent, uh, at dark, dark soccer's
357300	362500	house yesterday, Rob sent me a picture and I was like, enjoy your time in pinball heaven.
362500	363500	Yes.
363500	365660	I wanted to send him a picture of your Mando machine.
365660	367720	You've probably already sent him one, but I want to send him a picture of your Mando
367720	373180	machine because the only other place I've played that table was at Bobby's house.
373180	376780	So it was kind of funny that like, I've never played this game anywhere, but at people's
376780	380100	houses one on the east coast, west coast.
380100	381100	Yeah.
381100	386100	Well he has some type of super special table too, but yeah, you have that like actual grow
386100	387380	goo in the table.
387380	388380	Yeah.
388380	393460	So Dan's friend, um, who runs, uh, coin op here in town.
393460	394460	Oh shit.
394460	395460	Okay.
395460	399740	Um, there's a mod for the Mandalorian that has an animatronic grow goo in it.
399740	400740	Yeah.
400740	402740	And it looks good.
402740	403740	It's cute.
403740	404740	Exactly.
404740	410620	So we, um, when it came up, you know, Dan just went and bought like the little animatronic
410620	415900	figure from target and his friend, uh, installed it.
415900	420860	So now ours moves around and does weird shit and is creepier than ever.
420860	426100	I will say something that dark soccer doesn't always represent clearly on this show.
426100	430900	I'm going to put it in very clear terms is how well cared for all of those pinball tables
430900	431900	are.
431900	432900	I mean, of course.
432900	433900	Well, yeah.
433900	438660	I mean, that's, that's mr dark soccer that does a lot of that upkeep, but, um, I still,
438660	440840	those, those machines and there's many machines in your house.
440840	442820	There's like six in the garage.
442820	445220	You have one another four in the office.
445220	450420	Then you have like two in the living room, two in the little side area slash dining room.
450420	458780	There's six outside in Dan's office, two in the living room and three in the dining
458780	459780	area.
459780	461300	So that's 13 in the house.
461300	463480	We have, I think two loaned out.
463480	464820	Now I want to be clear.
464820	467860	It makes it sound like they live in a hoarder house.
467860	470340	It is not that case at all.
470340	476140	We do know it's re it's really not the way they make those pinball machines and fit them
476140	477140	in.
477140	478140	It actually works.
478140	481580	Like, you know, especially like in your dining area in the living room, like you fit them
481580	485980	in and strategical places where like, Oh, this is just, these people love pinball and
485980	486980	it's awesome.
486980	487980	Yeah.
487980	488980	Yeah.
488980	489980	It really works.
489980	492980	In the living room is Star Trek and creature from the black lagoon.
492980	501060	And then outside we have, we have the two, the two Jersey Jack ones, which is, uh, AC DC,
501060	502060	not AC DC.
502060	506260	We have, uh, we have pirates and we have, um, guns and roses.
506420	507420	Yeah.
507420	509700	Dan was telling me about that pirates and what a score that one is.
509700	512380	That's like one out of 150 machines or something.
512380	513380	Yeah.
513380	518300	That pirate one was really, and then we've got, we have AC DC cause Dan, I made that
518300	521460	happen for Dan, thanks to, uh, work stocks.
521460	522460	Yeah.
522460	526220	Um, but I want to say, wait, before you, before you go in the inventory, like I wanted to
526220	529960	say about the actual tables is that the upkeep is done very well.
529960	533100	For example, you guys have a theater of magic and you know, I'm going to recognize that
533100	534980	table as one of my all times favorites.
534980	540100	But the thing about, well, the thing about it, when you look at the table, like the box
540100	544620	is not all faded like it is on most machines, you're going to see it, uh, a bowling alley
544620	547400	or a bar or whatever, you know, cause it's a pretty popular table.
547400	551960	Your boxes and the, like, there's even like the little chain around the top, which I have
551960	553420	never seen intact.
553420	556300	Oh, that's why, okay.
556300	558540	So I have a story about this one.
558540	559540	Okay.
559540	560540	Quick.
560540	563580	I don't want to inventory all the machines cause it's a video game show, but this one
563580	565540	has got a special story to it.
565540	566540	Okay.
566540	572740	So it came up, um, at work we've got, uh, well at the time it was like a, an email mailing
572740	579940	list that we had and now we have a Slack chat for it, but one of the, the higher up engineers
579940	585620	at the company I work for, um, said, Hey, I'm selling a theater of magic, you know,
585620	588080	in San Jose, you know, blah, blah, blah.
588080	590540	And I messaged him as like, well, what do you want for it?
590540	593460	And then I, you know, I played messenger with Dan and we're like, well, let's just make
593460	594340	this happen.
594340	600900	So we went, um, to San Jose to pick it up and it, it was a fully shopped thing.
600900	602260	We bought extra plastics.
602260	607260	We bought a different versions of, of the, of the, the box.
607260	610580	So we've got all kinds of extra stuff that came with it and he was really fair about
610580	614700	it, but the day that we bought it was our 13th anniversary.
614700	621060	So on the bios, when the game boots up, it says happy 13th, Dan and Jamie, that's so
621060	622060	cute.
622060	623060	I love that.
623660	625780	We went and got melody for this.
625780	626780	There you go.
626780	629180	Um, Loki, Loki, I don't want to leave you out.
629180	633320	I w I know right now it's probably hard to think about collectibles because the kids
633320	638340	are still a little rowdy there at that age, but you know, in three or four more years,
638340	641020	you know, the kids are going to be a little more grown up and probably settled down a
641020	642020	little bit.
642020	643020	Yeah.
643020	645200	They'll have problems of a different sort, but you don't have to worry about them wrecking
645200	646200	pinball tables.
646200	649980	Are you, are you thinking about getting into collecting anything additional?
649980	650980	I don't know.
650980	658500	I pinball tables or anything along those lines, Loki, I know the room in my house for anything.
658500	659900	He wants to collect a new house.
659900	661540	I understand.
661540	664420	I need, I need rooms to start collections of things.
664420	667340	I already have an arcade cabinet and a broken arcade cabinet.
667340	668340	So all right.
668340	670960	Well, how many years till Josh is 18 and moves out?
670960	672460	That's when you get to start collecting.
672460	673460	Yeah.
673460	674460	Riley.
674460	676020	He's moving out of 18.
676020	679620	That's very optimistic of you.
680260	681260	All right.
681260	682260	Fair enough.
682260	683260	All right.
683260	684260	I try to include low key in the conversation.
684260	685260	It's fine.
685260	686260	Anyway.
686260	687260	Uh, dark soccer.
687260	688260	Thanks for having us over yesterday.
688260	689260	Uh, we had a good time.
689260	690260	Oh, I should have been sure.
690260	691560	I know it's a little bit of our gaming weeks, but whatever.
691560	692980	It's a holiday show.
692980	696660	Y'all know there's hardly any news this week, so we have time for extra shit.
696660	697660	Okay.
697660	701980	Um, you got one of those little, and this has come up on the show before, but, um, you
701980	706340	got one of those little mini DDR cabinets that look like, you know, one of the little
706340	710500	mini, um, arcade machines, but it's, Oh, you have it out in front of you.
710500	711500	Thank you.
711500	713340	It's actually, but it's dance, dance revolution.
713340	714980	And so I got to check that out a little bit.
714980	715980	Super cute.
715980	723140	Um, I, the, the actual DDR that's in it is a little, um, rough.
723140	728820	It's kind of like game boy DDR, because what bothered me is that the arrows don't flash
728820	730560	to the beat of the music.
730560	735340	And for me, that's a crucial part of getting my timing right in DDR is being able to see
735340	736340	the flashing of the air.
736340	741140	They kind of pulse in an actual, uh, DDR machine, but you know, as far as a mini goes, it's
741140	746300	super cute and really cool to be reminiscent.
746300	747300	Yes.
747300	748300	A little bit.
748300	749300	What songs are in it?
749300	753820	It's a paranoia, make it better and, uh, keep on moving.
753820	754820	Yeah.
754820	755820	And that is literally it.
755820	756820	Yeah.
756820	760260	They're all Konami originals, but of course I'm keeping it in its little box because the
760260	761940	artwork on this is classic.
761940	762940	Yeah.
762940	763940	Yeah.
763940	768060	I was wondering how long until someone mods, one of those things to play already happened.
768060	772340	What, what kind of, how do those things, maybe, you know, Loki, or maybe, you know, dark soccer,
772340	776780	cause I don't, what, what's actually powering the emulation in that thing or what is that
776780	783620	running off of the one who modded it actually gutted it and put in like a raspberry pie.
783620	790020	Ah, that kind of like, I think that this can't really take anything extra.
790020	791020	I mean, it's dinky.
791020	792740	It's three entire songs.
792740	793740	Yeah.
793740	799300	Granted, they're in good quality, but the person who also, the mod that we saw, like
799300	804060	they modded the lights and everything, what I wish we had gotten with something like the
804060	810820	Pump It Up that they got where, um, it's like, I mean, it's kind of hard to tell through
810820	815220	my webcam, but it's about, of course, twice as wide as that with a widescreen monitor,
815220	818580	but it has two dance pads on it that come out like controllers.
818580	820420	Oh, that's really cool.
820420	822420	And so you can play along with it.
822420	823420	Yeah.
823740	827620	Some comments in chat, YYR in chat says it's not an emulation as far as I know.
827620	829060	It's just a newly programmed thing.
829060	830060	Yeah.
830060	831060	I should've, I should've said that.
831060	832060	Yeah.
832060	835700	Cause it's not clearly based on any existing version of DDR cause it's so part, I would
835700	839900	say it's even more parsed back than the Game Boy version.
839900	840900	You know what, if they ever put...
840900	841900	It's DDR.
841900	849900	It's, it's more of a DD, DD skirmish, dance, dance skirmish, or DD yarns, dance, dance
849900	852220	disagreement, dance, dance resolution.
852220	856300	Um, anyway, uh, YYR says it's not an emulation as far as I know.
856300	857780	It's just a newly programmed thing.
857780	858780	Yeah.
858780	861580	It's, it's what, uh, DDR would have looked like on an Atari 2600, but slightly better
861580	862580	graphics.
862580	863980	No, it looks better than that.
863980	864980	It does look better than that.
864980	865980	Uh, Orange Right says...
865980	869500	I mean, it looks good for its stinky little screen and everything.
869500	874980	For what it is, for a dinky little $20 thing, it's, it's very clearly a toy that lights
874980	875980	up.
875980	876980	That's what it is.
876980	877980	And it is the basic steps.
878060	882460	Like both of them are all like the basic charts for those three songs.
882460	886500	Go into that little gear thing on the very beginning and you can put it in another and
886500	887500	master and maniac.
887500	889740	So you can play them in the harder songs modes too.
889740	895140	But I'm saying just when you pick it up and play it, they're all like the step charts.
895140	896140	Got it.
896140	897140	Got it.
897140	898140	Oh yeah.
898140	899140	The actuals.
899140	900140	Yeah.
900140	901140	Yeah.
901140	902140	Yeah.
902140	903140	For sure.
903140	904140	And the little graphic on it is great.
904140	905140	It looks like just, it doesn't have anyone dancing on it or anything, you know, but it
905140	906140	is like classic DDR.
906140	907140	Yeah.
907300	908300	All right.
908300	913260	Um, Bobby Blackwell in chat says, so a lot of these games, more likely old TV games actually
913260	914580	use an NES chip.
914580	920700	A lot of the TV games in the 2000 and 2010s are actually just running NES on a chips.
920700	924020	So, um, I don't think it's even an NES thing in those.
924020	927580	I think it's even parse back than that, but, um, you know, it gets the job done.
927580	931300	I think the cutest part is watching the little dance pad light up and things like that.
931300	937460	I mean, this is no substitute for digging out your PlayStation and popping in dance
937460	939020	dance revolution, third mix.
939020	940660	It's no substitute for that.
940660	942700	It's just an, it isn't that cute.
942700	943700	Look how far it's come.
943700	945660	Isn't that game old now?
945660	947820	All right.
947820	951580	I need to make little, um, little figures.
951580	958900	Like I wonder if my, my little body Coon figures are the right size to stand on it.
958900	965380	I have, they're, they're like yay, big, they're like one 12th figures that, um, are used
965380	968140	that I use for art references when I draw.
968140	972060	And I wonder if they would, if not, I could probably make one, but I think it would be,
972060	974860	we talked about that last night with a little mini arcades that I have, cause I have those
974860	975860	other ones.
975860	984740	I have the, uh, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pinball one and the, um, the Galaga, uh, tabletop,
984740	989540	not the tabletop, but the, the table mini arcade.
989540	990540	Yeah.
990540	991540	One of those little one ups.
991540	992540	Yeah.
992540	995500	Now, now you have me knowing I need to go check, check the clearance inventories at
995500	1000660	places like Ross and, uh, probably if they have it there, then probably home goods, big
1000660	1006900	lots, like all those, like bargain stores were, was at TJ Maxx.
1006900	1011780	And I have looked, I've not seen another, but I swear I will scour.
1011780	1013860	And if I find them, I'll take you upon appreciate.
1013980	1017140	Well, well message me first because we need the space for it, but yes.
1017140	1018140	All right.
1018140	1019940	Let's put it on the table.
1019940	1021220	All right.
1021220	1024720	Let's get into, um, our kickoff topic tonight, something a little different.
1024720	1027380	So obviously we've been talking a little bit about the holidays.
1027380	1028380	It's a holiday week.
1028380	1030540	A lot of people are off work this week.
1030540	1036660	Um, the, the, the, the December 25th Christmas holiday is a big time for, you know, all of
1036660	1039220	the games that were created throughout the year.
1039220	1041220	They get released before the holiday.
1041500	1045620	So, so what I'm saying is that the gaming journalism and gaming media kind of dies down
1045620	1047400	this week in this time of year, right?
1047400	1051620	Because there's just not as much going on in the industry while people enjoy time off.
1051620	1055300	And you know, while most of the big, big titles for the year have been released, things will
1055300	1060540	start to pick up again in mid January, because it's a lot better than it used to be.
1060540	1064460	Um, because now we actually have game releases in January because somewhere along the line,
1064460	1068660	people figured out, Oh, well, people have those gift cards.
1068660	1072220	And it's also more the, Oh, we've got to get our games out by the end of the fiscal
1072220	1073220	year.
1073220	1074260	Cause that's far more important.
1074260	1075900	But anyway, this is a slower week.
1075900	1082820	So what ends up happening across gaming media is that we end up with fluff pieces.
1082820	1088740	What I mean by that is clearly somebody wrote an evergreen type of article or, you know,
1088740	1091900	somewhat timely for the holidays, they wrote it two weeks ago.
1091900	1095460	So it could be set to auto publish while they're off for the holidays.
1095460	1099580	Whereas, um, you know, there might not be as much game news and gaming media.
1099580	1102060	They still need those clicks coming in on the website, right?
1102060	1104260	They need those ad impressions and all that good stuff, right?
1104260	1107260	So I thought here we could do something a little new for orange lounge radio.
1107260	1111500	We haven't done this before, but I thought we would travel around the gaming journalism
1111500	1116420	sites and take a look at some of their fluff pieces and give our own spin on it.
1116420	1118180	Cause that's what we usually do with the news, right?
1118180	1121020	Is we kind of give our own spin and talk about it.
1121020	1126060	And we invite you guys in chat as well to, uh, go along with this as well.
1126060	1133300	Um, fifth dream in chat says the best 21 games of 2021 for every console.
1133300	1134300	Yes.
1134300	1135300	Much like that.
1135300	1139140	Except I actually don't have any of those, uh, game of the year type list.
1139140	1141340	I was going to say topless, but I think there is one actually.
1141340	1144140	So there's no game of the year type of list yet though.
1144140	1145140	So let's do it.
1145140	1150240	Let's, let's go around the, um, uh, headlines and, uh, give our takes on some things.
1150460	1151960	So let's start with this first one.
1151960	1152960	Okay.
1152960	1153960	This first, oops, not that one.
1153960	1160000	That's a picture of Bobby Black Wolf because I forgot to change the safari grab here.
1160000	1161440	Let's try that again.
1161440	1162440	Okay.
1162440	1167000	The first headline, our first headline was Bobby Black Wolf.
1167000	1168000	Okay.
1168000	1173960	So this first headline is from Kotaku and it's called you have died of dysentery, 50
1173960	1177280	years of traveling the Oregon trail.
1177320	1182000	And so this article is really just kind of talking about the fact that the Oregon trail,
1182000	1183920	it is a pretty old game.
1183920	1187800	Uh, the Oregon trail recently celebrated its 50th birthday.
1187800	1188800	And they're actually talking about that.
1188800	1192680	This is the first franchise to go for half a century.
1192680	1195920	Uh, originally the Oregon trail was going to be a board game, which I think is kind
1195920	1196920	of interesting.
1196920	1198400	I have the card game version.
1198400	1205520	I don't know about you guys, but like the Oregon trail has had a huge impact on my life,
1205640	1207880	uh, and my formative years.
1207880	1208940	What about you guys?
1208940	1211520	What was the, like, do you remember the Oregon trail?
1211520	1213880	Was it, was it an impact on you?
1213880	1218240	I feel like for a lot of people that are around our age, it is because I remember, and I think
1218240	1222720	I've brought this up on the show before, but I'll repeat myself cause I do that sometimes.
1222720	1227920	All of us are kind of in that cusp between being a gen X and being a millennial.
1227920	1230120	I think technically dark soccer and I are gen X.
1230120	1235120	Loki, are you like the first year of millennial or you, are you like the youngest gen X?
1235720	1236720	I don't know what that means.
1236720	1239080	I think 81, 80, I think 81 is millennial.
1239080	1244320	So then we're all gen X, but we do all fall in an interesting sort of what they were calling.
1244320	1249720	Do you remember Zillennial or XEN?
1249720	1253800	But another name for this was the Oregon trail generation.
1253800	1259000	And people that said that, I saw that an article, I've ever heard of that.
1259000	1260120	Go Google it.
1260120	1263160	It's probably come up in a search or something, but I saw like an article thing.
1263160	1266440	There was another name for it too, but I forget it because the Oregon trail one jumped
1266440	1268720	out of my mind.
1268720	1272080	But I just know the game was huge in my formative years, but what about you guys and your memory
1272080	1273840	or lack thereof?
1273840	1276760	I never played Oregon trail as a child.
1276760	1277760	Really?
1277760	1278760	Honestly.
1278760	1280760	Did you ever play it after?
1280760	1281760	Yeah.
1281760	1282760	Okay.
1282760	1283760	But never as a child.
1283760	1284760	Hmm.
1284760	1285760	Interesting.
1285760	1286760	It was always Carmen Sandiego.
1286760	1287760	Okay.
1287760	1288760	Okay.
1288760	1289760	So there were, okay.
1289760	1290760	But there's still something then.
1290760	1291760	Okay.
1291760	1292760	Okay.
1293360	1300560	In Alabama, we had a Mac for a hot minute in 1980 something.
1300560	1308800	And then like we had an Apple IIe somewhere in my high school, somewhere.
1308800	1315000	I didn't have regular use with a computer other than having a Coleco Atom where none
1315000	1321240	of my games worked, mind, because they got erased because Coleco was stupid with how
1321240	1322920	they built the machine.
1322920	1327080	You'd get a nice thunderstorm, all of your cassettes were erased, done with that.
1327080	1332240	Mike Defton chat says, I think the Oregon trail is a US only thing probably, but I think
1332240	1336740	dark soccer is also bringing up that perhaps it's only in the cultures and the parts of
1336740	1342080	America that had computer labs where that was like, but I remember like at my school,
1342080	1347800	we had a room with like 15 Apple IIe's, but it wasn't like your normal, it was the, you
1347800	1351600	got to go spend an hour in the computer lab today.
1351600	1357280	And Mrs. X's class got to go at one o'clock and Mrs. Y's class got to go at two o'clock
1357280	1359040	and play computer games.
1359040	1364480	And the Oregon trail was one of the huge ones and everybody wrote anything like that.
1364480	1365480	Oh, wow.
1365480	1366480	No, no.
1366480	1369480	Loki, did you have any memories or it was just me?
1369480	1374640	No, I had a, we had computer class that we would go to and play the Oregon trail in Carmen
1374640	1375640	San Diego.
1375640	1377280	That was pretty much it.
1377760	1381960	Oh, and I think maybe we also did, what was it, a logo writer.
1381960	1384280	Oh yeah, logo learning that.
1384280	1390080	Now keep in mind, when the Mac came out, I was 10.
1390080	1395200	I was already older than you would have been when things like a computer lab in a school
1395200	1396200	would have been more commonplace.
1396200	1400040	I would say still, it's not that far.
1400040	1402280	And you're in California.
1402280	1403280	The California thing.
1403280	1404280	Yes.
1404280	1405840	I will say that is probably a big difference there.
1405840	1406840	Yeah, for sure.
1407400	1408400	I never had anything like that.
1408400	1409800	I only had friends with computers.
1409800	1410800	Well.
1410800	1411800	Okay.
1411800	1415040	So the game, the question I also had with this to really kind of ask was what were the
1415040	1418720	important edutainment games of your formative years, if any.
1418720	1422480	So dark soccer, you did bring up Carmen San Diego, even if it wasn't in a computer lab
1422480	1424700	at school, you were playing that at friends' houses.
1424700	1426040	Was there anything else that you remember?
1426040	1427760	Like edutainment wise that really resonated with you?
1427760	1429720	Where in time was my big one?
1429720	1432080	Where in time was Carmen San Diego?
1432080	1434240	Because me, I'm a, I'm kind of a history nerd.
1434240	1437080	But I've always been a bit of a history nerd.
1437080	1440680	So that was really, really my thing.
1440680	1445000	The only other stuff that we did, like I played a lot of, I'm going to throw this in there
1445000	1454720	because it kind of was in there, but a lot of crypt equip on the Odyssey 2.
1454720	1456360	Just all those word scramble ones.
1456360	1459920	And we would just make them big and crazy to do that.
1459920	1463760	And I was pretty good at doing the unscrambles like that.
1463760	1467180	Quiz games were, were a lot of like history quizzes.
1467180	1469060	I was always really good at those too.
1469060	1474000	Like there were, there were a couple that we had on an Apple 2e that they were pretty
1474000	1479380	out of date, but you know, trivia is trivia.
1479380	1483440	Those quiz games were the only games I could get my mom to play with me on Commodore 64
1483440	1486280	is that, and our favorite was Family Feud.
1486280	1490560	And I would load it up and she would just tell me the answers to type in because with
1490560	1493480	my mother, you would think if she touched a keyboard, she'd melt.
1493480	1497040	She was that computer adverse, but she was like, I'll give you the answers and, you know,
1497040	1498040	so it would come up.
1498040	1501640	I'd read, I'd read the question and she'd tell me what the answers she thinks are.
1501640	1504300	And that's how we played games, but that was, there was a fun way to do it.
1504300	1506100	So I'll put this way.
1506100	1509200	My elementary school had a Mac before they had an Apple 2.
1509200	1510200	Interesting.
1510200	1515840	Even though it was the newer thing, like when they came out, they got one, one.
1515900	1520620	Bobby Blackwolf in chat is sharing a similar story saying we would have an Apple 2, one
1520620	1522080	for the entire grade.
1522080	1525640	The computer would move to different classrooms in a cart.
1525640	1528400	Since I had computers at home, I never used the one at school.
1528400	1531360	I was also a Commodore kid and the Apple 2 just didn't appeal to me.
1531360	1533560	I was a Commodore kid too, but I loved them all.
1533560	1541840	Like actually when I got to see an Apple 2 or like a TI 99 4a or one of the, I enjoyed
1541840	1545160	getting to do the stuff I didn't have at home.
1545160	1547520	So that was always basic for me.
1547520	1554260	Basic programming was kind of where, what my, uh, I guess edutainment was as a kid was
1554260	1564320	programming the damn balancing ball, you know, or, or you California people are fucking spoiled.
1564320	1565320	Maybe a little.
1565320	1568080	Well then Loki, let's talk to another fucking spoiled California person.
1568080	1571580	What were your edutainment highlights when you were younger?
1571580	1577140	It was just, like I said, the Oregon trail and, uh, Carmen where in the world was Carmen
1577140	1578140	San Diego.
1578140	1580660	I think we had, we're in time as well, but I don't remember that too much.
1580660	1581660	Yeah.
1581660	1582660	I don't remember where in time as much.
1582660	1583660	I know it exists.
1583660	1589380	That's all we had in our computer lab, although the last year, like, so it was weird cause
1589380	1595500	I sorta remember this cause the last year I was in grade school or elementary school,
1595500	1596500	I should say.
1596500	1603660	We did, they have like a computer in the classroom and I remember it was different than the other
1603660	1608700	ones cause the other computers were kind of like either the monochrome green stuff.
1608700	1613900	Um, there, I think later on there was some that were more like kind of VGA graphics type
1613900	1614900	things.
1614900	1620940	But this last one though, it was about how to use a mouse because prior to that we had
1620940	1622620	never used a mouse before.
1622620	1624180	That was like a brand new thing.
1624180	1628100	Um, so we had like a game or something, I don't even remember what it was that we learned
1628100	1630620	how to use the mouse.
1630620	1636340	Probably I remember a big one on the max was, um, was a crystal quest I think was the name
1636340	1640260	of the game cause they remade it for Xbox arcade in the early days of Xbox.
1640260	1641260	Okay.
1641260	1643780	I think it was called crystal quest and you would do, you collect all these little crystals
1643780	1646540	with the mouse and that's like how you can learn the mouse and then you have to get out
1646540	1652260	the exit and then it would make this, it would make the strangest oddly sexual noise when
1652260	1655660	you would just get like, like you got all the crystals and then you escape and it goes
1655660	1659780	like when you get out, it's so, yeah, it does.
1659780	1662340	I don't play the game somebody.
1662340	1663340	Okay.
1663340	1664340	Thank you.
1664340	1665340	Orange right.
1665340	1666340	Knows what I'm talking about.
1666340	1667340	Like I'm not like making this up.
1667340	1671940	I'm not like crystal quests is how you learned to do the Mac and you would collect everything
1671940	1676420	and then you get escape the level.
1676420	1677420	That's funny.
1677420	1678420	Yeah.
1678420	1683380	I don't play that game at all, but, um, I'm trying to think if we had anything else.
1683380	1687160	It was pretty much that and logo writer, like that was, that was it.
1687160	1692460	Like we, we had a pretty basic computer lab and then after elementary school, actually,
1692460	1701900	we know we did in junior high, we had, um, the first year I did in seventh grade, we
1701900	1707020	did like they did this program called the exploratory eight or seven or something like
1707020	1708020	that.
1708020	1712500	And it was basically all the different electives that are available, but you got to do them
1712500	1715340	for like two to four weeks.
1715340	1717620	So you'd bounce to every single one.
1717620	1724260	So it was like seven different electives and one of them was computers, but it was just,
1724260	1725500	it was just computer lab stuff.
1725500	1731580	I think the Elsa did maybe like typing as well, but it was pretty much what they worked
1731580	1732580	in trail.
1732580	1735100	I mean, I don't know.
1735180	1740060	I'll tell you what was, what was funny though, when I was in college now mind, this was me
1740060	1744020	taking a class in 1995, one of my English classes.
1744020	1749220	It was in the computer lab and, um, well, I'll just put it this way.
1749220	1757620	I played a lot of doom in black and white on a black and white Mac, boxy square Mac
1757620	1758620	classic.
1758620	1759620	Good times.
1759620	1764460	You know, I will say, I remember like, you know, we're right about that age where the
1764500	1768860	tech was changing fast because, you know, I, you know, we're talking about these edutainment
1768860	1771660	games and, you know, elementary school, but kind of like Jamie.
1771660	1775860	Now I start to, I have these memories when I get to about 12 years old, those were the
1775860	1780940	years that we were doing scorched earth in the science lab where he did have, he probably
1780940	1786060	had like seven computers or so in there, but who eats lunch in, you know, the science teacher's
1786060	1790700	classroom, only the most hardcore nerds, but as hardcore nerds, we're look, we're playing
1790700	1792060	scorched earth.
1792060	1796940	His only rule was do not be looking at anything adult or anything like that.
1796940	1797940	Do not.
1797940	1800020	Cause the minute you do that, that's the last time you're going to be in here.
1800020	1801260	And we were all well behaved nerds.
1801260	1804100	So we only did the scorched earth thing and the teacher would kind of look over once in
1804100	1808300	a while and go kind of give that interesting look and then go back to grading papers, you
1808300	1811860	know, just to make sure we weren't looking at porn, you know, that whole type of thing.
1811860	1812860	I played a lot of kicks.
1812860	1813860	Oh yeah.
1813860	1814860	That was a classic.
1814860	1815860	Yeah.
1815860	1816860	Yeah.
1817660	1823500	And I had a study study hall for one of my classes.
1823500	1827420	My senior year of high school, my friend Ashley and I did, and we had it in my favorite teacher's
1827420	1833660	classroom, which she's actually one of the few of my high school teachers I stayed in
1833660	1838820	touch with after graduation until she passed away a few years ago.
1838820	1842420	She was, she was almost like another mom to me.
1842420	1843580	That's how I felt at the time.
1843580	1846160	She really was just an absolute sweetheart.
1846600	1850840	She and her spouse at the time owned a store, like a hippie store called the Rainbow Connection.
1850840	1851840	Oh, that's cute.
1851840	1852840	I like that.
1852840	1853840	Yeah.
1853840	1859400	But at any rate, she had an old Apple IIe in the storage closet where we would hang
1859400	1861920	out in the big storage closet.
1861920	1867160	And I played a lot of kicks, a lot of kicks.
1867160	1871480	So that is me and school and playing a computer.
1871480	1872480	All right.
1872480	1873480	Well, let's go.
1873720	1877640	This next article I think is a little bit kind of tangential, a little bit to that,
1877640	1880240	but we're going to travel over to Engadget.
1880240	1886120	So Engadget on their site has an article called Hitting the Books, Amiga and the Birth of
1886120	1888280	256 Color Gaming.
1888280	1892640	So I have a feeling this is a little bit probably inspired by that recent announcement of the
1892640	1898240	Amiga Mini, but I think they actually also get into a book that was written around that
1898240	1900940	time Creating Qbert and Other Classic Arcade Games.
1900980	1905060	So this is, again, kind of one of those evergreen articles they can put up any time.
1905060	1912060	And they talked about how the Amiga was unprecedented graphics and sound at the time, 4,096 colors,
1912060	1915960	stereo sound, and all this really cool stuff that was with Amiga.
1915960	1917100	We never owned an Amiga.
1917100	1920020	We had a Commodore 64 certainly, but we didn't have an Amiga.
1920020	1926020	And I do remember how the Amiga was one of those ultra realistic things, or at least
1926020	1927020	at the time.
1927020	1933220	The question I have for chat and for my co-host is, what is an early memory when you remember
1933220	1940100	thinking that computer or console graphics, whatever, were so real and your mind was blown?
1940100	1943440	Because I think we've all been there over the years is like, oh, graphics are never
1943440	1945140	going to get better than this.
1945140	1946420	Graphics can never get better than this.
1946420	1950720	And then yet every console generation, they somehow get better.
1950720	1955860	But I'm sure as an example, the first time I played Super Mario Brothers 2, I was like,
1955860	1956860	oh, this is a cartoon.
1956860	1960180	This is like an actual cartoon on TV, but I'm playing it.
1960180	1965820	So what for you guys is a moment when computer or console graphics were so real that your
1965820	1966820	mind was blown?
1966820	1968540	Loki, I'll start with you.
1968540	1972820	Oh, gosh, that's a tough one.
1972820	1980060	The very first time, I would say not necessarily realistic, but Wolfenstein 3D, I remember
1980060	1986140	seeing that at CompUSA being played, and I thought that was really impressive.
1986140	1996960	As far as like super realistic, maybe like Grand Theft Auto 5 or 4, 5 had a ton of detail
1996960	1997960	in it.
1997960	1998960	I remember that.
1998960	2003860	I can't think of any like super detail.
2003860	2008820	I mean, like there's so many games out there, it's just like hard to pick one.
2008980	2016660	But I think the earliest one I was pretty impressed with was probably Wolfenstein 3D
2016660	2019060	then followed by Quake.
2019060	2023380	I wanted to kind of bold and underline the Wolfenstein 3D part, though, because I know
2023380	2026900	that game maybe hasn't held up as well over the years, and a lot of people think about
2026900	2028740	Doom and Quake, kind of like you said.
2028740	2030860	And certainly, yeah, those games were also hugely important.
2030860	2036720	But like Wolfenstein 3D, obviously that whole 3D part is very important because it was really
2036720	2041960	the first time I think any of us played like a fully 3D game like that.
2041960	2044480	Now, granted, people could get technical.
2044480	2048680	You can go back to like the vector based days and a game like Battlezone or something that
2048680	2049940	was also 3D.
2049940	2053280	The concept of 3D gaming was certainly around beforehand, but there was something about
2053280	2056800	Wolfenstein 3D and the graphics that that brought to the table and everything else that
2056800	2057800	was just like...
2057800	2058800	It was Hexen for me.
2058800	2059800	Very next level.
2059800	2060800	Of that era.
2060800	2065680	Well, Hexen was awesome because it was the first time we saw it where it's not a gun,
2065680	2066680	you know?
2066680	2070160	Wolfenstein 3D, bang, bang, Quake, bang, you know, all these games were shooty, shooty,
2070160	2074880	bang, bang, and my favorite phrase, but Hexen kind of put a different twist on it and that
2074880	2076840	was pretty cool.
2076840	2079640	So I would actually say Mortal Kombat.
2079640	2082320	Oh, that's oh, that's a really good answer.
2082320	2083320	That's a good one.
2083320	2084320	Yeah.
2084320	2085320	Yeah.
2085320	2086320	Yeah.
2086320	2087320	What was your what was that like the first time you saw that?
2087320	2091400	I was like, hey, it's people.
2091400	2092400	And blood.
2092400	2093400	This is great.
2093400	2094400	Sign me up.
2094400	2096760	I remember the first time I saw a fatality.
2096760	2099920	I was like, what?
2099920	2107880	And you know, we still kind of get the talk, even though now by statistics, female oriented
2107880	2113400	gamers are now have are now the majority of gamers.
2113400	2114400	Sure.
2114400	2118660	The the number of identified female gamers has exceeded male gamers.
2118660	2120520	This is our market.
2120520	2125920	I'm gonna say that now because as when I was that age playing Mortal Kombat and getting
2125920	2127520	Oh, girls don't play games.
2127520	2131200	I'm like, fuck you watch me kick your ass.
2131200	2135360	That started the fuck you let me kick your ass, you know.
2135360	2139400	And I even remember there's another game that that brought it out for me is this is when
2139400	2145980	I was working at Aladdin's castle in 1995 in Mobile, Alabama.
2145980	2150780	And my boss, it was Namco, it was when Namco had been buying up like a slew of arcades,
2150780	2153540	they bought Tilt, Aladdin's castle, all of that.
2153540	2157580	And we were sitting there because we got Tekken 3 like a full year before any of the other
2157580	2161580	arcades did, you know, Namco exclusive, that type of thing.
2161580	2169180	And we were I was going on the internet at my at my house with with my lesbian parents
2169180	2173100	and Barbara, rest in peace.
2173100	2177180	And I would look up who the Japanese releases work as they were, you know, after a certain
2177180	2182820	amount of time, they would release a character, we had them in a different order in the US.
2182820	2187340	But Anthony, my boss, and I were just standing there looking at him and he looks over at
2187340	2192820	me as like, you know what these look like what people look like, you know, the previous
2192820	2198220	games like that they were blocky and they were you could see the polygons and this he's
2198220	2203020	like, this is really the first time that I've looked at this and had to take a second glance
2203020	2205060	and think, Oh, my gosh, this looks real.
2205060	2206060	Yeah.
2206060	2208300	I mean, and now look at what we have.
2208300	2209300	Oh, yeah.
2209300	2210300	Oh, yeah.
2210300	2211300	Just after they've gone past that.
2211300	2220700	But I mean, but at the time, and then the, the the full movement, the the motion capture
2220700	2223580	was another big thing.
2223580	2229620	And we were just sitting there talking about like, how they did motion capture and how,
2229620	2235940	you know, you could record the movement of a person and incorporate it into a game.
2235940	2240020	YYR in chat is kind of backing up the same choice.
2240020	2243300	They're saying Virtua Fighter 2 and Daytona USA.
2243300	2248020	I was blown away by Model 2's 3D graphics at 60 frames a second.
2248020	2251580	It looked so real texture mapping was the way of the future.
2251580	2252580	Yeah.
2252580	2255940	And I remember those first fighting games were a little bit rough that when they were
2255940	2261660	in 3D, but then like, yeah, as they very quickly evolved into, wow, like very realistic looking
2261660	2262660	things.
2262660	2267660	Well, and I remember it was, I don't remember how old I was.
2267660	2271940	I was probably like 13 or 14, but it was my first time going to Las Vegas.
2271940	2278460	And it was when the Luxor had the Sega arcade, it was all Sega owned stuff.
2278460	2282500	And it was, it was, it was a downpour.
2282500	2283500	We were stuck inside.
2283500	2286620	It was either the Luxor or the Excalibur because they had the thing that went between
2286620	2287620	the two.
2287620	2288620	Yeah.
2288620	2296220	Um, and playing, um, Daytona, um, on like the multi person Daytona set up.
2296220	2298020	So like eight or 12.
2298020	2299020	Huh?
2299020	2301860	Didn't they have like eight or 12 machines linked together?
2301860	2302860	Yeah.
2302860	2303860	Yeah.
2303860	2306340	They were all strung together on like this big platform.
2306340	2307340	And I'll tell you there's another game.
2307340	2308900	Were they the ones with the actual like cars?
2308900	2309900	Yeah.
2309900	2311420	They're in the little car units.
2311420	2312420	Yeah.
2312420	2313420	That'd be awesome.
2313420	2317860	But I will go out and say there's another game that did that for me, that gave me that
2317860	2318860	moment.
2318860	2319860	And that was star blade.
2319860	2320860	Hmm.
2320860	2325460	And you know, I love star blade, but it had like the immersive cockpit.
2325460	2332620	If you found like the, the, the deluxe ones that would move around space Harrier, if you're
2332620	2336780	in the, and if you have the classic space Harrier or, uh, or afterburner that had the
2336780	2339180	the move there, I go with my pop filter.
2339180	2343420	Um, if you had the moving cockpits for them, the, the hydraulics and everything, I remember
2343420	2344660	those at the, what was it?
2344660	2345660	Starrcade.
2345660	2357060	Um, they had, uh, the, uh, at Scandia, they had one of the, uh, afterburners that moved
2357060	2358940	around until someone broke it.
2358940	2362540	Um, I want to get to chat answers cause you guys have some really good stuff in chat,
2362540	2365980	but since star soccer mentioned the arcade, I had to say, cause I remember my mind was
2365980	2369220	blown the first time I saw this game and it wasn't very good.
2369220	2371140	Um, I think it was a Sega thing.
2371140	2373740	I don't remember, but it was, um, it was the hologram game.
2373740	2374740	Do you remember that?
2374740	2379140	I think it was time being that it was called, they had it at the mine shop here in sack.
2379140	2380140	I remember that.
2380140	2381140	Do you remember?
2381140	2384140	And that the first time I saw that game, my mind was fucking blown.
2384140	2386020	Like just the hologram gaming.
2386020	2391180	Cause now you actually saw things in that 3d space and it was a really like, it was
2391180	2395940	like dragon's lair, but clunkier, you know, I, I, it did not play well.
2395980	2399140	It didn't play very well, but it was just, it was definitely a show off-y type of thing.
2399140	2400900	It was the start of that.
2400900	2401900	Yeah.
2401900	2402900	Yeah, for sure.
2402900	2406580	So anyway, um, getting into some other comments from chats, cause you guys have some great
2406580	2407580	answers in here.
2407580	2411840	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says another leap was Dreamcast and NFL 2k.
2411840	2416940	It looked like a TV broadcast and sun monkey says, yeah, the sports games always the first
2416940	2418580	ones to demo the new graphics.
2418580	2419580	Really good points.
2419580	2423540	You guys, um, fifth dream says dragon's lair, but it really was a cartoon.
2423540	2427940	Well it's, but still it was using that technology of a laser disc.
2427940	2428940	Yeah.
2428940	2431740	Like, you know, that, that was an impressive tech in the eighties.
2431740	2435380	In and of itself, dragon's lair and those, those games like that.
2435380	2439700	Um, like even going into cliff jumper, which was based off of a loop in the third castle
2439700	2448100	of Cagliostro and what was the racing one, uh, cliff, no, it was, I'll remember the name
2448100	2453860	of it because it always makes me think of, uh, of, uh, being bandit from whatever that
2453860	2454860	anime that I never remember.
2454860	2457540	The name is writing bean.
2457540	2465180	Um, but, uh, it's really also just very simple programming, you know, it's if this, then
2465180	2468900	this, if this, then not this, you know, yeah.
2468900	2473140	And it's really just playing on a path and you can memorize how to do it.
2473140	2478080	I mean, despite the cues that come up, but the thing that was great about that is because
2478080	2482240	they were starting to realize that people would spectate, like lean over people's shoulder
2482240	2484280	and watch the games.
2484280	2488860	And it was one of the first ones that they thought to put into their monitor on top of
2488860	2491820	the machine so that people could watch it being played.
2491820	2495220	And now they do that with some fighting games, uh, especially for like those, you know, heavy
2495220	2497400	tournament things, especially when new ones come out.
2497400	2500880	Um, Mike Deft is saying the game was called time traveler that I was trying to think.
2500880	2501880	I knew it was time something.
2501880	2502880	Yeah.
2502880	2503880	I remember a lot of folks in chat.
2503880	2504880	Remember it.
2504880	2505880	Yeah.
2505880	2507880	Um, I want to get to a couple other answers.
2507880	2508880	That was another one.
2508880	2513200	Um, I want to get to this answer from your muse, because I think this is, this is a great
2513200	2514200	answer for mere muse.
2514200	2518060	Well, they're all good, but this one in particular, uh, says, I remember being blown away by Ninja
2518060	2520220	Gaiden because of the cut scenes.
2520220	2521600	It was like a movie.
2521600	2523060	Hell yes.
2523060	2525680	That was groundbreaking for the NES.
2525680	2526680	You're right.
2526680	2527680	I was like a movie.
2527680	2529240	Okay.
2529240	2534620	How many of y'all were guilty of doing the voices since there was no voices?
2534620	2537340	How many of y'all were guilty playing the game with your friend and doing the voices
2537340	2538340	and the cut scenes?
2538340	2539340	Okay.
2539340	2540340	Just me.
2540340	2541340	That's fine.
2541340	2542340	Yeah.
2542340	2543340	People.
2543340	2544340	Yeah.
2544340	2545340	Go to different Twitch channels.
2545340	2546340	People still do that.
2546340	2548380	Have you been watching any of my play through of hot to full boyfriend?
2548380	2549380	Yes I have.
2549380	2550380	I've been lurking.
2550380	2551380	I've been voice acting everything.
2551380	2552380	Yes.
2552380	2553380	Yes.
2553380	2557940	Um, and uh, Bobby Black Wolf with kind of a winky face answer, honestly with the matrix
2557940	2559820	awakens tech demo.
2559820	2563060	So I mean, I know that's a little bit tongue in cheek, but at the same time it just goes
2563060	2566340	to show the boundaries are still being broken.
2566340	2567340	Right.
2567340	2569420	So, you know, and that's a very recent release.
2569420	2570420	All right.
2570420	2573580	Um, we still have, I still have like four more of these, so this is a good, this is
2573580	2574700	a good time filler tonight.
2574700	2580420	Uh, but this is our next one here from IGN, our next topic, and they are running with
2580420	2585340	the headline called why 2021 was the year of the multiverse.
2585340	2590940	And by the way, why does IGN need these gigantic fucking ads on their site, especially the
2590940	2594360	ones that autoplay, ah, so annoying.
2594360	2596700	And of course, you know, their purpose is to make money.
2596700	2600100	You know, if I turn this off, it's just going to go right back on because it never remembers
2600100	2602420	your saves there anyway.
2602420	2603480	So here's the thing.
2603480	2605620	This article is talking about the multiverse.
2605620	2608620	So, you know, IGN kind of talks a bit about more than just gaming.
2608620	2612540	They talk about MCU, but then they talk about, you know, Star Trek.
2612540	2617500	They talk about the Nickelodeon stuff with the Ophineas and Ferb and that whole stuff.
2617500	2620740	They get into all this stuff and the different multiverses here.
2620740	2627500	So I thought a fun little follow up question to IGN's ad filled article here, uh, would
2627500	2633700	be what multiverse or crossover games since multiverse might be a little difficult, but
2633700	2638180	what multiverse or crossover games do you want to see?
2638180	2644260	So already playing one, dark soccer, you're playing the, the, the fantasy crossover game
2644260	2645700	you've always wanted to see.
2645700	2646700	I'm playing dead by daylight.
2646700	2653580	How fucking cool is that, that I can play like famous, you know, horror movie killers.
2653580	2655380	I'm getting Sadako.
2655380	2656960	That makes me so fucking happy.
2656960	2663580	If we got, you know, uh, Kayako and Toshio next from Zhiyun, I would be even, even happier.
2663580	2670700	Although I would love to have an X-Men game done like Guardians of the Galaxy.
2670700	2677380	I would be over the moon, but that would make me super happy.
2677380	2680460	I miss having a really good X-Men game to play.
2680460	2686300	The last one I think I played that wasn't a fighting game was the Sega Genesis one,
2686300	2687300	maybe.
2687300	2689860	Um, Loki, what about you?
2689860	2693100	Can you think of a multiverse and crossover game you really want to answer pod culture
2693100	2694100	real quick?
2694100	2695100	Yeah.
2695100	2699340	Which team it would be a make your own.
2699380	2701500	All right, Loki.
2701500	2707540	I mean, I guess Ready Player One would be pretty good.
2707540	2711020	I mean, that was just kind of a crossover of all sorts of things.
2711020	2713260	Um, but that'd be pretty cool.
2713260	2717620	I guess they never did do like a, uh, uh, actual game tying.
2717620	2720660	I mean, I know they did the little Olympics online.
2720660	2726500	They did like a, um, kind of like a, you know, I don't think it's official, but they did
2726540	2733140	like a Ready Player One VR game that had like some different games within it, but it's not
2733140	2738260	really like the actual game or movie or book or whatever.
2738260	2740780	Um, I just think that'd be pretty cool.
2740780	2750020	Uh, otherwise, you know, something that I'd like to see, I don't know, maybe a Mario Kart
2750020	2753500	game with like characters from other games in it.
2753500	2756540	Definitely not just Mario Kart, Nintendo Kart.
2756540	2757540	Yeah.
2757540	2761300	You know, and in chat E3VL has responded to the question saying, you know, basically that
2761300	2763540	the best crossover game is smash ultimate.
2763540	2765740	Like, you know, the best crossover game already exists.
2765740	2770100	And I think my answer to this question kind of lies in there too, is that Nintendo has
2770100	2774580	kind of shown that they're willing to bleed their franchises over to make an incredible
2774580	2776220	game like that.
2776220	2778260	Let's see that in other genres as well.
2778260	2783540	Um, and I would, I would love to see, because I think everybody remembers the greatness
2783540	2785980	that was Super Mario RPG.
2785980	2791160	And a very easy answer to this would be, we want to see a fucking Super Mario RPG too.
2791160	2795020	But I think the easy, easy answer, and here's where I'm going to go with this, is we want
2795020	2799940	a, I want a Nintendo Kingdom Hearts type of thing.
2799940	2800940	That's what I want.
2800940	2801940	That would be amazing.
2801940	2807060	And honestly, like, you know, the, the Super Mario RPG, I would love to have a Super Mario
2807060	2812220	RPG, but the Paper Mario games have actually been pretty good in, in kind of, you know,
2812220	2813220	that realm.
2813220	2814220	Filling that void.
2814220	2815220	Yeah.
2815220	2816220	It's sort of, I mean, it's different.
2816220	2820540	The combat's different in each game and stuff, but like, it's pretty cool.
2820540	2825100	I mean, it's pretty close to that kind of feel of an RPG game, but yeah, I would like
2825100	2826740	an actual RPG game.
2826740	2827740	It would be pretty awesome.
2827740	2831300	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, fuck yes, Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.
2831300	2835260	Um, Tiger Claw with a couple of comments here saying there was that Super Mario crossover
2835260	2837700	fan game that lets you play other characters from the NES.
2837700	2838700	Oh yeah.
2838700	2843700	There was, I think the devs were in Sacramento actually, because I remember there was a kickstart.
2843700	2848060	They tried to kickstart the game with like, they had to change the characters names and
2848060	2852620	make them look slightly different, but they basically still have the same thing.
2852620	2857060	And um, yeah, I don't know what ever happened that it just kind of dropped off the face
2857060	2858060	of the earth.
2858060	2862060	Um, Tiger Claw in chat says crossover games are kind of all the thing right now, Smash
2862060	2865300	Brothers, Nick All Star Brawl, and now Multiverse.
2865300	2867080	And then also says there's Fortnite.
2867080	2868820	They do a lot of crossovers.
2868820	2872620	Well, and that's kind of, I think where IGN was going with the article, you know, even
2872620	2876900	though yes, it's a fluff piece, I think it is a, you know, an accurate observation is
2876900	2881660	that it's kind of a trend we're seeing when I, I'm going to be honest, when I first opened
2881660	2884380	it up, I thought I was going to be reading something about the metaverse cause I read
2884380	2885380	too fast.
2885380	2888780	But then when I was reading what was in front of me, I was kind of, okay, you know, yeah,
2888780	2893180	this does seem to be a trend in gaming is, you know, the WB's got something coming with
2893180	2894180	all their stuff.
2894180	2895740	Nickelodeon has their thing.
2895740	2899260	We know the Avengers was a big game reason and so on and so on.
2899260	2902380	You know, these, these huge crossover games are kind of a big thing right now.
2902380	2906060	Uh, Jordan Ramsey versus Cookie Mama.
2906060	2907140	I love it.
2907140	2909060	And Gordon Ramsey just mines Bitcoin.
2909060	2915500	Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, I want a new NES remix, but with other third party games, something
2915500	2916980	like that would be awesome.
2916980	2917980	Hell yes.
2918060	2921940	I would love, Nintendo needs to revisit that NES remix concept.
2921940	2922940	I think there was a good shit there.
2922940	2924780	What if Konami brought back Konami YY World?
2924780	2930940	That might be a little obscure for people, but hey, Konami's got the Bomberman thing
2930940	2933580	and they're bringing like, you know what, you want to talk about multiverse?
2933580	2934580	Like what?
2934580	2937980	Like Pyramid Head is in Bomberman and like now they got Suikoden characters in there.
2937980	2943180	Like Konami's, they, any IP they own, they've put in Bomberman somehow.
2943180	2944180	That's for sure.
2944180	2949220	So, uh, Sia Tabiri says, I would love to see more of a crime focused Pokemon game like
2949220	2953020	Phoenix Wright cross Pokemon, uh, E3VL points out Detective Pikachu.
2953020	2956380	Yeah, kind of, kind of a little bit, maybe a different tone.
2956380	2957980	That might be a different tone though.
2957980	2958980	So anyway.
2958980	2959980	All right.
2959980	2961900	Uh, good answers on that.
2961900	2964380	Let's go to another headline here.
2964380	2971860	The next headline we have is from, what is this site, GameSpot, uh, who had ran an article.
2971860	2976260	This is really, and look at this again, another gigantic fucking autoplay ad at the top of
2976260	2977260	the page.
2977260	2983500	Finally, you scroll down and here's the headline, free game roundup, happy holidays.
2983500	2987900	And I, they talk about games that are free right now, but then they get into stuff that's
2987900	2992740	like Xbox games with gold and those aren't exactly free, but whatever.
2992740	2994580	It had me thinking about free games.
2994580	3000720	By the way, here's a PSA for those listening live on Sunday night, uh, the Epic Game Store
3000720	3005680	today is giving away control and I realize people have their opinions on the Epic Game
3005680	3006680	Store.
3006680	3007680	Some people refuse to touch it.
3007680	3008800	I respect that.
3008800	3009800	That's fine.
3009800	3013780	However, if you are one of the type that's just willing to use it to leech all of the
3013780	3020600	free stuff on Epic's dime, uh, go, which I am to go for it and pick up control because
3020600	3024500	that is the free game, but it's only unfortunately podcast folks probably going to be gone by
3024500	3026160	the time the podcast comes around.
3026160	3028560	Um, but you know, they've been given away free stuff every day.
3028560	3032520	I just think the big ones are usually like the first game, maybe the last game.
3032520	3036560	Uh, and then like, you know, Christmas day and I guess today cause they gave away prey
3036560	3037560	yesterday.
3037560	3038560	That was a pretty big deal.
3038560	3041920	Oh, apparently I have the game already, given it out already.
3041920	3043800	I think they did give it out at once.
3043800	3047880	Uh, I think I've had it too, but I have it on Stadia.
3047880	3052240	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my favorite part of the segment is Rob pointing out the
3052240	3055400	actual reason they're releasing these articles by complaining about it.
3055400	3056400	Oh, the ads.
3056400	3057400	Of course.
3057400	3058400	Of course.
3058440	3059440	It's on the internet.
3059440	3060440	I'm going to complain about things.
3060440	3062440	That's what we do here.
3062440	3063440	Anyway.
3063440	3066920	Um, so of course it was, yeah, dark to see it says Shenmue three was free a week ago
3066920	3068440	and like only for a day.
3068440	3069440	Yes.
3069440	3072000	So what a question do I have about free games?
3072000	3073120	It's this.
3073120	3076480	Have you ever, this is very much is, is rageinator still out there?
3076480	3079000	Cause I think this is very much a rageinator inspired question.
3079000	3081920	So wherever you are, shout out buddy.
3081960	3088480	Have you ever gotten a game on sale or super cheap that ended up being a hugely pleasant
3088480	3093760	surprise and by super cheap, that can include free I'll go first because my answer to this
3093760	3098120	quite honestly would be the classic game that dark soccer picked last week.
3098120	3103840	VVVVV is absolutely my answer to this because it came in one of those humble bundles and
3103840	3107760	it wasn't something I was necessarily seeking out, but when I bought the humble bundle,
3107760	3110880	I noticed like, Oh, this is kind of like Commodore 64 inspire.
3110880	3114720	This looks like it might be fun, obsessed.com with that game obsessed.
3114720	3116800	In fact, I kind of want to play it again.
3116800	3121920	Maybe that'll be a stream in the near future, but like that was a game where I was not expecting
3121920	3124080	that to be as good as it was.
3124080	3128600	And I got it for very, very, very cheap, maybe not free, but very cheap, like where I felt
3128600	3129920	like I stole it.
3129920	3137440	Um, Loki, anything for you in the, I discovered an amazing game for free or cheap for free
3137440	3138440	or cheap?
3138440	3145120	Um, well, I mean, it was, it's technically it wasn't cheap.
3145120	3152440	I think it was this, I can't remember if it was 40 or 20, maybe 40, but earth defense
3152440	3154560	force 2017.
3154560	3160120	I think that was, it was pretty cheap and that was just endless amounts of fun.
3160120	3163640	There was another one I was trying to think of like, but I'm looking through my steam
3163640	3170440	library and I can't find it because I have too many games in here, but there was another
3170440	3171880	one through humble bundle as well.
3171880	3176080	That was really good, but I can't think of the name of it right now.
3176080	3181120	Um, well, if you think of it, we'll come back to, um, you know, before I kick it over to
3181120	3185400	dark soccer with this question, um, actually thinking of the types of games, dark soccer
3185400	3188680	enjoys actually brings another very relevant answer to mind.
3188680	3193440	Dead by daylight was something I got to play because of Xbox game pass.
3193440	3197440	And I knew that Alan played the game and really enjoyed it.
3197440	3198800	Um, and I'd watched stream.
3198800	3201520	He got me into some of this cause he would watch these streamers in bed and I'd just
3201520	3202520	be like, what are you watching?
3202520	3203520	What are you watching?
3203520	3206400	And then, you know, then I, I think they were very funny and, you know, started to get into
3206400	3207760	watching the streams as well.
3207760	3210920	And then I was like, I don't know if I could play this game cause I'm not big on horror.
3210920	3213560	And then of course, you know, I was like, oh, it's actually not that gory at the end
3213560	3214560	of the day.
3214560	3218120	Like it's, uh, you know, it's not, you know, actually graphically, it's really not that
3218120	3219520	intense of a game.
3219520	3223960	It's really just about, you know, the, um, the different mechanics and that whole thing.
3223960	3229920	Um, so, but it was because the game was on Xbox game pass that I was like, all right,
3229920	3231620	I'll download it and check it out.
3231620	3233120	If I don't know, hold on.
3233120	3235240	If I don't like it, no harm, no foul.
3235240	3238080	I didn't actually spend money on it cause I'm just paying for game pass.
3238080	3239480	So that would actually be my other answer.
3239480	3240480	Okay.
3240480	3241480	Loki quickly years.
3241480	3244520	And then we'll go back to dark Sakura until dawn rush of blood.
3244520	3247400	It was 20 bucks and that was excellent.
3247440	3253360	It is easily a $60 game easily, but, but yeah, that would be my pick.
3253360	3254360	Good answer.
3254360	3259640	Um, in the chat room, uh, tiger class says VVV is one of those games that speed run.
3259640	3262040	Bobby Blackwell points out every game is speed run.
3262040	3266440	Uh, E3VL says live service online multiplayer games aren't speed run though.
3266440	3270880	Actually, I hate to well actually you, but I'm going to well actually you, those are
3270880	3271880	speed run as well.
3271880	3276320	In fact, cause Shane was telling me about one that he was watching this weekend where
3276320	3282760	somebody was speed running the entire main story in final fantasy 14 over like 72 hours
3282760	3284000	or something like that.
3284000	3288640	And it was just getting through the thing as fast as possible without like you could
3288640	3290160	not chain run dungeons.
3290160	3292880	You actually had to go through the main scenario and do it that way.
3292880	3298240	So people come up with their own wild rules that in turn become a speed run.
3298240	3300240	It's just, you have a lot more options with an MMO.
3300240	3301840	Anyway, I'm sorry, dark soccer.
3301840	3305080	What about you and cheap or a free discoveries?
3306000	3312400	Um, I just got Piconiku, which I've been wanting to play.
3312400	3318600	Um, I I've got a bunch of games that have just come out, you know, free one way or another.
3318600	3324760	Like when I started, wow, I think I had like a free thing for it and I played like after
3324760	3329840	cataclysm for a while, um, dead by daylight.
3329840	3333680	I don't even remember ever having bought it the first time.
3333680	3336400	It might've been a stadia giveaway game at some point for all I know.
3336400	3342760	Yeah, I think it was cause at the time I, I got all my DLC, like really dirt cheap.
3342760	3346840	And I have a bunch of great games that I've gotten on stadia for quote free.
3346840	3351640	I have the pro membership, so there's a lot of really great games that I've picked up
3351640	3352640	that way.
3352640	3359200	Um, I have, I have, uh, I've been wanting to play control and I just got control, um,
3359200	3361760	I mean, but I already had it on stadia.
3361760	3367240	Um, there's always, you know, a lot of the, the ones that pop up on steam for, for dirt
3367240	3368240	cheap as well.
3368240	3370600	And then people have, have bought me games.
3370600	3376080	Um, so I really have a hard time naming one versus the other.
3376080	3379920	Cause typically it'll take like, I'll pick up a game and I'll be like, okay, this is
3379920	3380920	fun.
3380920	3382600	And then I'll lose interest cause that's just the way my brain works.
3382600	3388120	I'll, I'll, you know, I won't stick with it and then I'll find the one and I will stick
3388120	3389120	with it.
3389120	3394480	And that's kind of what dead by daylight is for me right now.
3394480	3398840	Um, Detroit actually, uh, I got Detroit pretty cheap.
3398840	3403320	You know, you brought up world of Warcraft and it did, and you know, between that and
3403320	3407440	the comment about MMO speed runs in chat kind of made me think that like, usually, you know,
3407440	3411960	a lot of those games like, wow, you know, final fantasy 14 does the point, does this
3411960	3417160	to the point that it's a meme, um, has the free trials to kind of get you hooked and
3417160	3419960	it's like play until level, whatever, whatever.
3419960	3422440	And then, you know, pay a monthly fee after that.
3422440	3423440	And you know, wow.
3423440	3424440	Has one.
3424440	3425440	Long as he 14 has one.
3425440	3426440	It's suspended right now.
3426440	3427440	They have one.
3427440	3428440	What's that?
3428440	3429440	Ragnarok online.
3429440	3430440	Oh, or just straight up.
3430440	3433320	That was the one I played for free for a long time.
3433320	3436920	Can Pokemon go ingress saw the cell phone game?
3436920	3437920	No, no, no.
3437920	3438920	Ragnarok online.
3438920	3441520	I played in the, in the Japanese beta.
3441520	3442520	Yeah.
3442520	3443520	Yeah.
3443520	3448320	The US beta came out and I played in the US beta and then they were going to make us start
3448320	3450320	fucking paying for it.
3450320	3456080	And I paid for it, but, and then they were like, oh, well, your beta characters are coming
3456080	3457080	over.
3457080	3459440	Then a lot of us jumped ship and then free servers happened and all of that.
3459440	3467760	But Ragnarok online, I played that for a good 10 years consistently.
3467760	3471320	I'm sure as you recall, I have still a picture of our characters sitting in pronterra field
3471320	3475360	with your, your little major wearing a bow, which I had, then you had a mask or I had
3475360	3476360	a mask.
3476360	3478200	We were very ahead of our time in that regard.
3478200	3479200	Yeah.
3479200	3484880	I was, I would always, uh, play the assassin and you had a cute little mage.
3484880	3485880	Yep.
3485880	3486880	All right.
3486880	3487880	Adorable.
3487880	3489280	Uh, just a couple more of these, but I think, I don't know about you guys.
3489280	3490280	I'm having fun.
3490280	3492120	So let's look at a couple more of these.
3492120	3497040	Uh, so let's go now over to games, radar.com.
3497040	3502300	Who's running an article, uh, that says the play team debates, which kids book they would
3502300	3504000	turn into a game.
3504000	3506040	Um, I don't know who the play team is.
3506040	3507760	I'm assuming that's just some thing in house.
3507760	3509000	Maybe they have a podcast.
3509000	3513420	I don't know, but they're talking about being traumatized by fairy tale and they've got
3513420	3514420	a mag.
3514420	3515420	Oh, it's a magazine.
3515420	3516420	I see.
3516420	3517420	Uh, and so on.
3517420	3519840	So, uh, of course this lends itself to the quest and there really isn't much of an article
3519840	3520840	here is there?
3520840	3521920	Oh no, I guess it does.
3521920	3523760	You just can't tell cause of all the ads.
3523760	3529440	So they go around and somebody says, Grimm's fairy tale, uh, somebody talks about the far
3529440	3533040	away tree, um, and so on and so on.
3533040	3538440	So of course, I'm going to ask you guys, what book do you want to see made into a video
3538440	3539440	game?
3539440	3540440	This might be a hard question.
3540440	3544080	Um, Darcy, I'll start with you.
3544080	3550260	One of my favorite book series would be the Harold de Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey.
3550260	3554420	And I would love that to be made into an RPG where you can play one of the heralds
3554420	3560060	in, in the, the main kingdom and have all of their interesting little powers and you
3560060	3566900	go around and rescue people and save and, you know, settle disputes and do all the stuff
3566900	3572180	that they do in the books and go to the different kingdoms and diplomatic missions and all kinds
3572180	3573180	of fun stuff like that.
3573180	3575060	I would be totally down for that.
3575060	3576060	Loki.
3576060	3577060	How about you?
3577860	3579780	Um, children's book.
3579780	3583780	I would say it doesn't have to be Jones, but this is no children's series.
3583780	3589580	They're going to be ready player one, or it's going to be, uh, you know, uh, Charlie and
3589580	3593020	chocolate factory, I guess that, Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
3593020	3595940	Uh, the wizard of Oz would be awesome.
3595940	3599340	Oh, or like the, the greater Oz store.
3599340	3602500	There's so many stories in those books that have not been realized.
3602500	3603500	Yeah.
3603500	3605940	That's a really good answer.
3605940	3608540	I'm surprised they haven't tried to like MMO that universe.
3608540	3609860	Maybe that'd be really hard though.
3609860	3615020	Um, I think they might've, if I recall, I think they approached bounds of state about
3615020	3617660	it and there was a big rejection.
3617660	3621620	I have to go back and find that I remembered reading something, but yet they made that
3621620	3623460	movie with Lea Michelle, whatever.
3623460	3624460	All right.
3624460	3627860	Uh, and like James Franco, there's some Oz movie they did a few years ago.
3627860	3630980	Oh, the great and powerful, the great and powerful.
3630980	3635500	I kind of wanted to see that, but I always, my favorite that was returned to Oz because
3635540	3638460	it was like right based off of like three of the books.
3638460	3640540	That movie fucked us all up as children.
3640540	3646180	Like again, that speaks, you know, it's funny cause they say we're the Oregon trail generation.
3646180	3647540	We should be the, what was her name?
3647540	3649540	Princess Nambi.
3649540	3650540	What was her name?
3650540	3651540	Nambi.
3651540	3652540	Yeah.
3652540	3653540	That should be our job.
3653540	3656540	We're the, we're the princess Nambi generation because that bitch scarred us all with her
3656540	3658140	heads in the jars and all that.
3658140	3659140	I'm sorry.
3659140	3663620	Or when they start, when they start screaming, Oh yeah.
3663660	3665660	Oh, that was great.
3665660	3666660	Not Lea Michelle.
3666660	3667660	I thought it was Lea Michelle in that.
3667660	3668660	All right.
3668660	3669660	Whatever.
3669660	3670660	All right.
3670660	3672660	But you know who else that was in return to Oz?
3672660	3673660	Uh, Farisah Balk.
3673660	3674660	Yep.
3674660	3675660	Yeah.
3675660	3676660	She was Dorothy.
3676660	3677660	That was such a good movie.
3677660	3678940	That was a great movie.
3678940	3685180	Uh, my book series, I was going to say RL Stein's Goosebumps.
3685180	3686180	Didn't they do games?
3686180	3687180	I thought they did some games.
3687180	3691780	They've done, I think they did, um, movies, uh, but I don't think they've done games or
3691780	3692780	if they've done games.
3692940	3696220	There was, there might've been point and click adventure games.
3696220	3700780	Cause I was going to say the babysitters club, but I'm pretty sure those have been games.
3700780	3702180	There's like some point and click.
3702180	3703180	Okay.
3703180	3704580	Oh, fifth dream says they've done games.
3704580	3705580	All right.
3705580	3706580	Fair enough.
3706580	3707580	All right.
3707580	3708580	I tried.
3708580	3709580	All right.
3709580	3710580	Uh, one more article.
3710580	3711580	All right.
3711580	3712580	One more.
3712580	3713580	This has been a long save of this is good.
3713580	3714580	You guys enjoy this as a time filler.
3714580	3715580	All right.
3715580	3716580	Press one in the chat.
3716580	3718580	If you enjoy, uh, us filling time with this segment.
3718580	3719580	All right.
3720580	3724580	Last story here is from, what website is this?
3724580	3725580	Even this thing.
3725580	3726580	Oh, Game Informer.
3726580	3727580	Okay.
3727580	3728580	So we're going to visit Game Informer.
3728580	3732940	And, uh, I thought this was an appropriate one for Orange Launch Radio as we head into
3732940	3737380	our 20th year of broadcasting next year.
3737380	3739500	And remember how it all started?
3739500	3744220	Cause Dark Soccer, Loki and I all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.
3744220	3751180	So of course this piece on Game Informer about the top 10 music games caught my eye
3751180	3755420	or should I say top 10 music games to play right now?
3755420	3756420	Play them right now.
3756420	3760900	Well, folks, I thought, I thought, well, it's 10 Loki.
3760900	3766780	Uh, I thought, I thought we could review the list together, uh, and give our expert opinion
3766780	3768700	on how well done this list is.
3768700	3769700	So you guys ready?
3769700	3770700	Here we go.
3770700	3776380	So according to Game Informer, and this is in no particular order, uh, Fuser is the first
3776380	3777740	game that they mentioned.
3777740	3784580	I did like Fuser, but I liked Fuser as a concept more than a game personally, but I, I, I look
3784580	3786140	at it more as like a canvas.
3786140	3788380	It's like an interactive type of thing.
3788380	3793280	So, um, it's YYR says, I bet DDR isn't on there.
3793280	3794280	We shall see.
3794280	3795280	We shall see.
3795280	3797680	Uh, Fuser is the first one.
3797680	3799340	Rock Band 4.
3799340	3800860	I think that's a pretty solid pick.
3800860	3805900	I think a lot of us are nostalgic for the Rock Band Guitar Hero era right now, which
3805900	3811180	is funny because it's very hard to get those controllers and that sort of stuff.
3811180	3815620	Like, you know, just when all the plastic shit was filling up our house, now we can't
3815620	3816820	find it anywhere.
3816820	3817820	It's just very interesting.
3817820	3818820	I have them all in my garage.
3818820	3819820	Good.
3819820	3820820	Good for you hanging on to them.
3820820	3821820	Just closet.
3821820	3822820	Good for you inside my room.
3822820	3823820	Liking dust.
3823820	3824820	All right.
3824820	3827060	So Rock Band 4 is on their list, so that's two.
3827060	3828420	Let's see what else is on the list.
3828500	3832620	So we then have Cadence of Hyrule that Sia Tabiri said in chat.
3832620	3838860	So, um, this of course is based on, um, Crypt of the Necrodancer, but they did it with Zelda.
3838860	3841340	So, um, this is cute.
3841340	3848420	I like that Nintendo lent a very valuable, like they believed in this enough to lend
3848420	3853240	such a big property to the developers like indie developers.
3853240	3857580	And I was almost more excited about that than just the fact that it's a solid music game
3857620	3858620	to be honest.
3858620	3859620	So.
3859620	3860620	Hmm.
3860620	3861620	All right.
3861620	3864060	Moving on the list, Beat Saber.
3864060	3865860	I mean, I think this is a given.
3865860	3872100	Like it's, it's the, it's, it's like the VR app basically, um, is, is Beat Saber.
3872100	3875260	And now it has Lady Gaga, which just elevates it that much more.
3875260	3881620	So I'm on board with the, uh, Beat Saber, uh, the next one on the list, Rez Infinite,
3881620	3884580	to which I give a giant fuck yes.
3884580	3888160	This is one of the best music games that will ever be made.
3888160	3890980	And in fact, I'm still kind of salty.
3890980	3896620	The Area X, which was very clearly a prototype for a new Rez game was not fully realized.
3896620	3901460	So just, especially now with the graphics that, you know, they're pushing on these consoles.
3901460	3903100	Oh, right.
3903100	3905460	So yeah, I would absolutely agree with Rez Infinite.
3905460	3909820	Um, the next pick on the list is Tetris Effect.
3909820	3914500	So not usually something I think of with music game, but at the same time, yes.
3914500	3919420	Uh, it absolutely does qualify and it is absolutely the best version of Tetris on top
3919420	3920420	of that.
3920420	3921420	Um, for sure.
3921420	3927820	So I, I definitely, uh, you know, uh, Mizuguchi is huge on the music, uh, stuff, obviously,
3927820	3930980	as we see with Rez Tetris Effect is right up there.
3930980	3931980	Funny.
3931980	3934960	And again, I pointed this out on the show before, but I'll say it again.
3934960	3939980	If you actually look at the credits for Rez Area X, it talks about how it's run on the
3939980	3943860	Synesthesia engine, which is the exact same engine that runs Tetris Effect.
3943860	3945100	If you look in the credits.
3945100	3948340	So those games are connected.
3948340	3949340	Yours forever.
3949340	3950340	All right.
3950340	3952620	Uh, moving on.
3952620	3956020	The next game on their list, Thumper.
3956020	3958080	This is an interesting choice.
3958080	3959140	I get it.
3959140	3964980	I'm not sure it's one of my top 10 favorites of all time, but I do feel like it did bring
3964980	3971220	something very different to the table, um, with the whole music horror, but they kind
3971220	3973000	of, they do it in a neat way.
3973000	3977480	Like it's not just like, Oh, symbol hovers over thing, press button.
3977480	3979880	Like this is a very different way to approach that.
3979880	3982560	And I can applaud it for that.
3982560	3986480	So there is that, um, moving on.
3986480	3991600	And Bobby says, uh, this isn't top 10 of all time, but top 10 to play now, which means
3991600	3993600	it's available for modern consoles.
3993600	3996800	Well, you know what?
3996800	4001480	I also, why, why did you all just throw your retro consoles in the dumpster?
4001480	4002480	Do you all not have phones?
4002960	4009080	All right, the next item on the list, I'm going to just, so here's one that I'm going
4009080	4011400	to say, no, this is wrong.
4011400	4013200	BPM bullets per minute.
4013200	4016600	Um, uh, Alan got this one.
4016600	4018440	We're checking it out a little bit.
4018440	4019700	I think it wears out.
4019700	4020700	It's welcome pretty quick.
4020700	4022200	I don't think this is that good of a game.
4022200	4023200	Uh, sorry.
4023200	4026460	I know that's kind of mean cause I know it's more of an indie game this month in my humble
4026460	4027460	bundle thing.
4027460	4028460	Well, that's good.
4028460	4029460	It was free.
4029460	4030460	Uh, I just, I wasn't free.
4030460	4032900	I had to pay for it, but you know, I just free enough.
4032900	4036940	I think it's one of those things that sounds cooler than it actually is.
4036940	4038460	So I don't know.
4038460	4039460	So there's that.
4039460	4042380	Uh, let's see the next item on the list.
4042380	4044140	Audica, uh, is on the list.
4044140	4047740	This was harmonics is kind of answer to the VR music game space.
4047740	4052140	I think this game is better than people's memories.
4052140	4056980	Give it credit for because the conversation is always Beat Saber, Beat Saber, Beat Saber.
4056980	4061140	And yes, Beat Saber is a good game, but that doesn't mean other VR games that are music
4061140	4062180	based can't exist.
4062180	4063940	And I think Audica is pretty decent.
4063940	4068180	Um, I've, and I enjoyed, they have a lot of good licensed music in it and so forth.
4068180	4072140	So, um, I think, I think Audica is worthy of the list, especially if you are looking
4072140	4078020	at a modern stuff that you can get right now type of list.
4078020	4080980	Um, yeah.
4080980	4082860	And then was that it or is there one more?
4082860	4084140	Oh, there's one more on the list.
4084140	4087980	And again, I think this is a lazy pick.
4087980	4091220	Just Dance 2022 is the last one they have on their list.
4091220	4095620	Um, I, maybe this is just my opinion.
4095620	4101300	Just Dance 2022, again, this list coming from Game Informer, I think that list is, or that
4101300	4105300	particular entry, I think Just Dance is more of an exercise title than it is a music game
4105300	4106300	title.
4106300	4111360	Um, because yes, it involves music and hypothetically, you're supposed to be doing things in time
4111360	4114800	to the music, but, um, it doesn't really measure you on that.
4114800	4116320	It's really all about the poses.
4116320	4119680	And I really think that game is more of an exercise game than it is a music game, in
4119680	4120680	my opinion.
4120680	4123480	But, um, I realize people have their own opinions.
4123480	4127180	So what music games did they miss?
4127180	4130040	And I of course think they miss DDR.
4130040	4133080	And I, I know, I know Bobby's typing his comment.
4133080	4134840	It's games you're supposed to be able to play now.
4134840	4138080	You can walk in any round one or Dave and Buster's and lots of other places and still
4138080	4139080	play DDR.
4139200	4145640	Uh, and I'm just surprised that the granddaddy of music games is not still on that list.
4145640	4151240	So, um, other thoughts of other oversights, what do you guys think of that list?
4151240	4153240	Theatry of them theater.
4153240	4155520	Oh, that's an excellent choice.
4155520	4158400	I realize you have to go back a little bit because that was a 3DS game.
4158400	4162480	I think three theater rhythm ought to be revived.
4162480	4166280	I thought they had newer versions that were like on PlayStation stuff.
4166280	4170720	Like I thought they had console versions of those, uh, theater of them note was only
4170720	4171720	on 3DS.
4171720	4173960	Um, they have that ribbon.
4173960	4174960	I'm kidding.
4174960	4176520	They have that kingdom hearts game.
4176520	4180960	Um, but some people were saying was theater of them successor.
4180960	4184120	And my answer to that was, I hope not.
4184120	4187000	I'm actually kind of relieved that kingdom hearts wasn't on this list.
4187000	4190840	Sayonara wild hearts count.
4190840	4191840	Good pick.
4191840	4193040	Yes, yes, yes.
4193040	4194040	Good pick Loki.
4194040	4197320	I take, take off BPM and put, um, that one.
4197320	4198320	Good answer.
4198320	4199320	Good answer.
4199320	4200320	Good answer.
4200320	4203720	Uh, anything else jumping out at you guys?
4203720	4209000	Some folks in chat are talking about, Ooh, Mike, but like, you know, Mike deaf says groove
4209000	4212800	coaster and a Tycho no Tatujin.
4212800	4215840	So I I'm all for a new version of a theater of them as well.
4215840	4216840	That's for sure.
4216840	4217840	All right.
4217840	4218840	So there you go.
4218840	4224840	Those are some gaming journalism, fluff pieces, and our take on them to help us fill the gap
4224840	4226800	in the news this holiday season.
4226800	4227960	I hope you enjoyed that.
4227960	4231240	So maybe we'll do the segment again sometime during a slow news week, because when it's
4231240	4236560	a slow news week for us, it's a slow news week for those ad revenue, uh, that those
4236560	4240680	websites that need to show you full screen ads before you can read someone's hot take
4240680	4242760	on what music games you should download.
4242760	4244800	So there you go.
4244800	4247520	And who knows how many of those music games paid to be placed on that list?
4247520	4248520	We'll never know.
4248520	4249600	All right.
4249600	4253840	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this
4253840	4256640	week in a segment we call how was your gaming week?
4256640	4258340	So a dark Sakura, let's go to you.
4258340	4259680	How was your gaming week?
4259680	4263120	Um, it was eventful.
4263120	4266000	Of course I played a good bit of dead by daylight.
4266000	4267000	Like I do.
4267000	4273200	Um, I've been streaming hot to full boyfriend holiday star, which, uh, I actually just finished
4273200	4276240	the main story last night.
4276240	4280960	Um, but now I'm doing the side stories, you know, I'm not going to do that tonight.
4280960	4282760	Um, I'm still, I don't know.
4282760	4285520	I might, I'm still going to be doing dead by daylight tonight.
4285520	4288080	Um, uh, there's been some pinball.
4288080	4293200	There's been that little tiny DDR that I just showed off.
4293200	4296400	Um, I play, oh yeah.
4296400	4297400	And Fantasian.
4297400	4299500	I love Fantasian.
4299500	4301680	It's actually such a good little RPG.
4301680	4304280	I actually have a game I'm looking for.
4304280	4305440	What's that?
4305440	4307000	It's called internal section.
4307000	4312360	It's kind of a tempest flight game, but it's got a pretty good soundtrack and it's a square
4312360	4316200	game that did not see release in the U S and this one I've been wanting to get my hands
4316200	4318240	on and now I'm kind of on the hunt for it.
4318240	4319240	Okay.
4319240	4320240	Interesting.
4320240	4321240	Without me paying 70 bucks.
4321240	4323040	All right.
4323040	4324040	Let's go to Loki.
4324040	4325040	Loki.
4325040	4326040	How was your gaming week?
4326040	4327760	It's all Minecraft again.
4327760	4333920	Um, so yeah, I've been just playing a ton of Minecraft, um, hours and hours, hours just
4333920	4337760	getting ready for like my next episode, actually working on it right now.
4337760	4344000	Um, so I, earlier today I was, um, filming some stuff and then I have a building doing
4344000	4345000	for that.
4345000	4346800	So hopefully we'll have that out soon.
4346800	4347920	All right.
4347920	4352380	Uh, and for my gaming week, um, I would say the bulk of my gaming week, no surprise is
4352380	4360460	still on the final fantasy 14 expansion, but on Christmas day yesterday, I beat Endwalker.
4360460	4362760	So I am completely through the story.
4362760	4363760	Everything's done.
4363760	4367960	Uh, I even now I've run the expert dungeons thanks to free company and, you know, starting
4367960	4370760	to explore some of the post game slash end game content.
4370760	4373040	So, um, I will not get into spoilers.
4373040	4374040	Don't worry.
4374040	4379040	Um, however, since I have a lot to say about the story and I have a lot, I want to get
4379040	4381240	off my chest about that journey.
4381240	4386720	Uh, I thought it would be fun to just for funsies, uh, get my final fantasy buddy, Shane,
4386720	4392640	uh, who you've heard on the network before together to do a spoiler filled final fantasy
4392640	4393640	14 discussion.
4393640	4396200	And that is going to be Wednesday night here at VOG network.
4396200	4400360	Uh, I think it'll probably be about five Pacific, um, but stay tuned to our Twitter for all
4400360	4406080	the details at VOG network and of course our discord, uh, VOG network.com slash discord,
4406080	4409360	and we're going to have a spoiler filled and yes, it will be very clearly marked on the
4409360	4412120	stream and all that stuff so that nobody accidentally gets spoiled.
4412120	4416420	We're gonna have a spoiler filled discussion about Endwalker and how we felt about it because
4416420	4418960	I'm sure Shane feels very similarly.
4418960	4422560	We have feelings about some of the story and some of the things there.
4422560	4426440	So we're going to do that, um, a little later this week.
4426440	4432000	I will mention though that the journey to getting to beating this game was a little
4432000	4438360	rough because they put out a patch on Tuesday to address some of these queue issues.
4438360	4442940	The good news is they, they, I don't want to say they fixed the queuing issues because
4442940	4446800	there is still queues and they are still sometimes thousands of people long.
4446800	4451240	I do feel like they're getting smaller, but I don't know if that's just because the holiday
4451240	4455200	or what, you know, and people traveling and going other, just having other things to do
4455200	4459760	and what that's all about, but people are no longer erroring out while they're waiting
4459760	4460760	in line.
4460760	4463120	Uh, or at least I'm not hearing about it nearly as much.
4463120	4466640	Um, so that, and that was the biggest issue most people had was getting kicked out of
4466640	4469560	line after waiting in it for an hour, which can be very frustrating.
4469560	4472560	So I think people are at a better place with the queue, even though square has long ways
4472560	4474540	to go to fix the issue.
4474540	4475540	That's not the issue.
4475540	4481540	The issue for me is that a very small, few amount of PC players, including myself, and
4481540	4484980	I know I'm not alone cause I've seen other people talking about it on Reddit and in Twitter
4484980	4488460	threads, we are having very bad sound issues.
4488460	4491300	Uh, it is like sound tearing.
4491300	4496840	The sound will do something like this when you're trying to play the game, like it's
4496840	4501340	very like stuttery and you probably had no idea even what I was trying to say there.
4501340	4502340	And that's what it's feeling.
4502340	4506100	It feels like when you're trying to play the game, uh, not like a hundred percent of
4506100	4510980	the time, but when you get into intense action sequences, it does this again, a small amount
4510980	4512500	of players are seeing this.
4512500	4515940	The patch on Tuesday was supposed to address these issues.
4515940	4516940	Made it worse.
4516940	4517940	Yes.
4517940	4521740	I read Yoshi P's letter and I did everything he said, didn't change a damn thing.
4521740	4525300	I need them to revert the sound driver back to the last version.
4525300	4530580	Um, which, you know, and some people say that modders might be able to fix the last at it's
4530580	4533700	hard because it's an MMO Loki, but at this point I feel like that's the only way it's
4533700	4534700	going to get fixed.
4534700	4535700	Uh, yeah.
4535700	4538020	And Zebun chat says it's not happening to everyone though.
4538020	4539020	Right.
4539020	4542580	And the problem is, is that, and this is the reality.
4542580	4547700	If it's not happening to a person, then it's not a problem.
4547700	4552100	So it's really only a problem for me and the minority of players, maybe, I don't know,
4552100	4555900	maybe 1% of PC players, maybe even less than that who are having these issues.
4555900	4557340	It's a huge problem.
4557340	4563100	And I got to the point on Tuesday or whatever day the patch came out, because it got worse,
4563100	4564940	that I was hovering over the cancel button.
4564940	4571140	Like I was, and I have, y'all know, I have, stand that game hard since the day it came
4571140	4572140	out.
4572140	4578620	Um, even 1.0 I played, I was just so, I felt so defeated by the fact that I couldn't even
4578620	4580620	play this thing that I enjoyed.
4580620	4586980	Um, but I, I, then I realized, Oh dummy, you play for three months at a time, so you're
4586980	4590460	paid through through February anyway.
4590460	4592260	So what did my stupid ass do?
4592260	4596260	I figured out that the only way I'm going to be able to actually get through the story
4596260	4603060	and not get spoiled any more than I already had been, was to buy it on PlayStation four
4603060	4606960	and get a PlayStation license because I knew I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have the problem
4606960	4608340	on PlayStation.
4608340	4612300	So I mean, what, it's not like it's the first time I've bought a game on two different consoles,
4612300	4613300	right?
4613300	4617660	I bought Endwalker on PlayStation four and got that license.
4617660	4619060	That's how I beat the game.
4619060	4623140	And I've been playing on keyboard and mouse on PlayStation four, and it's not the best,
4623140	4628380	but I will take it versus the sound issues I was having were going through dungeons was
4628380	4630700	giving me a headache quite honestly.
4630700	4633340	Um, so at least I finally got through the story.
4633340	4635660	I still need them to fix the client.
4635660	4640780	I'm worried if they're ever going to, because again, if the problem isn't there, then people
4640780	4643340	say it doesn't exist.
4643340	4645160	Anyway.
4645160	4650460	So overall, I really enjoyed the expansion.
4650460	4652940	I don't think it's my favorite expansion story wise.
4652940	4654780	I think it's somewhere in the middle for me.
4654780	4659260	I'll get into the reasons why in the spoiler cast, but I did think it was a good end and
4659260	4665260	there were, I think for me, there was a lot of peaks and valleys.
4665260	4668540	There were some things that were like, this is better than the game's ever been.
4668900	4673700	Like the whole last zone up until a point was so, so good.
4673700	4677660	I was like, Oh, this is, this is, this is the best this game's ever been.
4677660	4681380	And then you get to valleys and some of the worst that the game's ever been quite, and
4681380	4683340	I don't have a nice way to say it.
4683340	4688620	And for me, that would be things like the, the, the brilliant idea to add stealth quests
4688620	4693960	into the game that are a little bit moody and temperamental in the way they work, uh,
4693960	4698220	and escort quests, which is, you know, something vanilla allow had.
4698220	4701460	So those are some things that are a little bit more value.
4701460	4705300	And then there's some story things I don't want to say right now, but I I'll say later.
4705300	4710300	Um, so peaks and valleys for me, but I do think at the end of the day, I think as we
4710300	4715660	get into the patch expansions, the point one, the point two and so forth, what is a peak
4715660	4722180	for the game is the technical end of it and the way it plays all of the jobs, as far as
4722180	4726500	I've seen and heard, they are all in a better place than they've ever been.
4726500	4732660	And every job is really fun to play right now, even barred, even monk, you know, and
4732660	4737220	the things that usually we're getting shit on previously are all really fun to play right
4737220	4738220	now.
4738220	4742560	And at the end of the day, that is probably more important than the story is, is the day
4742560	4745360	to day, like actual gameplay really fun?
4745360	4747780	And the answer is yes.
4747780	4751520	So that's in short, my take on Final Fantasy 14.
4751520	4755460	Other than that, I've also still been playing quite a bit of dead by daylight, especially
4755460	4759300	that day and a half the Final Fantasy and I were fighting, I was trying to get a lot
4759300	4761260	of blood points in a dead by daylight.
4761260	4764660	And I'm trying to prestige Cheryl slash James again.
4764660	4767520	And I'm just about to prestige too.
4767520	4774260	So I'm about to get to level 50 again, and then prestige Cheryl again, so Dr. Did you
4774260	4775260	nice?
4775260	4777420	Oh, and I got a debt trapper.
4777420	4778420	Oh, cool.
4778420	4779420	Okay.
4779420	4780420	Oh, wow.
4780420	4782220	That's hard to get those a debt.
4782220	4784980	I got it the first try.
4784980	4785980	Congrats.
4785980	4788700	You must have had some survivors that were like babies.
4788700	4789700	No.
4789700	4790700	Really?
4790700	4792180	It was a really good match.
4792180	4793180	Good for you.
4793180	4794180	Well, good.
4794180	4795180	That makes me feel better.
4795180	4797580	But the thing is, is that I've talked to four other people now who have said that they got
4797580	4798740	it their first try.
4798740	4799740	Huh?
4799740	4800740	Maybe I need to try it.
4800740	4801740	Let's see.
4801740	4802820	Go for it.
4802820	4804020	It was easier than I thought.
4804020	4806820	And on top of that, it was on Macmillan's.
4806820	4810020	All right.
4810020	4811020	That's really bad.
4811020	4812020	Doctor was harder.
4812820	4813820	Good for my gaming week.
4813820	4817900	Um, so yeah, I'll probably this week we'll put probably some more fall fantasy 14 no
4817900	4822060	man's sky expedition four is going to be, I think next week three is happening right
4822060	4823060	now.
4823060	4825020	Alan has already finished it.
4825020	4826640	He didn't even get a chance to stream it.
4826640	4830820	He played, he just put the pedal to the metal on expedition three and already finished it
4830820	4832060	in like three days.
4832060	4834460	So that's kind of kind of neat.
4834460	4837620	So I'm really excited to get through expedition four in no man's sky.
4837620	4841980	And then Alan and I are talking about playing like a co-op game together with all the rewards.
4842940	4843940	From the expeditions.
4843940	4844940	I think that'll be really fun.
4844940	4845940	All right.
4845940	4846940	I know we had some.
4846940	4847940	Oh, go ahead.
4847940	4848940	If I may.
4848940	4850580	I also forgot to say to those celebrating it.
4850580	4851580	Happy Kwanzaa today.
4851580	4852820	Yes, of course.
4852820	4853820	Happy Kwanzaa.
4853820	4854820	Um.
4854820	4855820	Cause that is actually today.
4855820	4858020	I think you did say boxing at the top of the show.
4858020	4860340	Uh, what else is, is there anything else today?
4860340	4861340	I don't know.
4861340	4862340	There's um.
4862340	4866260	Happy me shoving all this stuff in my face days.
4866260	4867260	Happy cookies.
4867260	4868260	All right.
4868620	4872020	Um, we do have a few news articles to talk about tonight.
4872020	4874180	We don't have as many as we would have on the normal show.
4874180	4878020	Uh, that's why we let the kickoff topic take a lot more time tonight, but we do have a
4878020	4879700	few articles to talk about.
4879700	4883220	Uh, definitely this first one, I think we want to do a little bit of a Nelson laugh
4883220	4884220	maybe.
4884220	4885220	I don't know.
4885220	4886220	Maybe we don't.
4886220	4887220	Uh, Loki.
4887220	4888220	Why don't you get into this first article tonight?
4888220	4889220	Yeah.
4889220	4894420	So, Hey, you remember those wonderful, uh, Ubisoft courts, um, that whole service where
4894420	4900100	they were selling these things called digits, which were basically in game NFTs.
4900100	4904260	Well, they haven't sold many of them.
4904260	4912980	Um, it looks like roughly they sold 15, um, but that's not what you saw putting that number
4912980	4913980	out.
4913980	4914980	How did they figure that out?
4914980	4915980	That only 15 have sold.
4915980	4919620	Is that like watching people's wallets, which I know they can do in crypto.
4919620	4925460	So, um, they were looking at, cause you know, with these, they can actually, um, take a
4925460	4927700	look at, you know, cause it's on the blockchain.
4927700	4931700	They can take a look at, you know, how many were minted and all that stuff.
4931700	4939020	Um, so they were looking at, um, I guess a couple of authorized resellers, so raritable
4939020	4945500	and object, and you kind of looking at, you know, what was selling on those.
4945500	4953780	So right now they said there's only a handful of sales that was a 94.49 tezos, which is
4953780	4961380	like guess 380 bucks, but yeah, not very, um, very many have sold so far, which makes
4961380	4967000	sense because you have to play the game for 600 hours and just, yeah.
4967000	4972300	So it appears the marketplace is rejecting the NFTs.
4972300	4975300	So does that mean we're, we're free of them?
4975300	4978300	We're going to be rid of NFTs forever now in gaming.
4978300	4985140	Oh, Oh, somebody is going to try to find that magic formula to make it work.
4985140	4986140	Huh?
4986140	4987140	Exactly.
4987140	4995500	And, um, of course there has been, you know, comments regarding, you know, people not liking
4995500	4996500	the NFTs.
4996500	5004800	Um, so coming from Ubisoft's blockchain technical director, um, Didier Geneva's, he was saying
5004800	5010640	that we're doing this anyways, you just need time to get used to it.
5010640	5017280	Gee, uh, I'm sorry.
5017280	5018320	That's what it boils down to.
5018320	5019320	That was a paraphrase.
5019320	5023000	Uh, what he basically said was we have received a lot of feedback since the announcement.
5023000	5025920	We hear both the encouragement and the concerns.
5025920	5028080	What encouragement no one's encouraging you.
5028080	5031360	Uh, we understand there is, there is low key to be fair.
5031360	5035860	There is absolutely because I've seen it and I know people that are in it.
5035860	5039560	And I, and here's the thing, like, I'm not trying to be a total curmudgeon about the
5039560	5040560	NFTs.
5040560	5043320	I'm trying to get, have an open mind with it.
5043320	5049320	And I see people on social media, but there is absolutely in on Twitter, on Facebook,
5049320	5055160	on blog, there is an echo chamber of people gassing each other up that NFTs are the next
5055160	5056400	big thing.
5056400	5059080	Whereas the rest of us, and some of you may be involved in it too.
5059080	5062640	And I'm not, again, this is not a personal attack, but I hope you understand that the
5062640	5067580	rest of us are looking in from the outside going, this doesn't make sense.
5067580	5072120	And until here's the thing, I'm sorry to the NFT bros out there.
5072120	5078680	You have to convince me to get in on this for this to be successful.
5078680	5081620	You can't sit there and say, well, everybody else is an idiot.
5081620	5083040	This is the next big thing.
5083040	5084040	You're a dummy.
5084040	5087600	If you don't understand it, it cause guess what that is going to lead to an echo chamber
5087600	5089400	that goes down the drain.
5089400	5090880	No, I get it.
5090880	5096160	You're basically buying and selling artwork, but it's digital artwork.
5096160	5103660	You don't get any actual, like, sure you have digital ownership of it, but like, is this
5103660	5107160	JPEG worth like the money that you're seeing it's worth?
5107160	5108280	No, it's not.
5108280	5109360	I'm sorry.
5109360	5110920	And it's not really exclusive.
5110920	5115560	Like if I bought a painting, sure, I could take a picture of it and you could have a
5115560	5121480	picture of it and you could see the picture of the painting, but it's not a one-to-one
5121480	5124400	exact duplication of it.
5124400	5130760	Whereas if I go on the internet and I have an NFT image that's out there, I could make
5130760	5134020	a direct copy of it and it would cost me nothing.
5134020	5136840	I have to read this and direct it to you in chat because I think this hits the nail on
5136840	5137840	the head.
5137840	5141700	Dartica in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says someone on Twitter compared it
5141700	5145200	to the company selling stars from other galaxies.
5145200	5146440	The whole thing from years ago.
5146440	5147920	Oh, they still do that.
5147920	5148920	Absolutely.
5148920	5149920	Get sell a star.
5149920	5152760	That is, that is so good.
5152760	5155800	They already such a good explanation.
5155800	5160940	It is exactly like that because they even have like these quote unquote games that are
5160940	5162520	going on with NFTs.
5162520	5169440	So like they have one where you basically buying land like on earth.
5169440	5174080	So it's like I go onto Google earth and like, I like that piece and I'm going to buy it
5174080	5175080	as an NFT.
5175080	5181800	E3VL is bringing up the Spiderman NFTs cause a lot of people got them cause you know, the,
5181800	5183440	the no way home movie is huge.
5183440	5187040	Tons of people are seeing it and I guess what was the first hundred thousand or something
5187040	5189720	got some sort of NFT in their email.
5189720	5191480	And I think a lot of people are going great.
5191480	5195880	And now people are, I have seen people again, people I know and people I watch on Twitter
5195880	5198320	are trying to sell those NFTs on Twitter.
5198320	5202760	I don't know if they're being successful or what, but my, my question is, okay, so what
5202760	5203760	does it do?
5203760	5206200	It's just proof of ownership.
5206200	5207680	It's my little virtual badge.
5207680	5213920	I saw the, the Spiderman movie before any y'all or whatever.
5213920	5222680	It would be like if, for example, on, um, steam where you get like little trading papers
5222680	5227920	and emojis trading cards, whatever the case may be, but each one of those were uniquely
5227920	5229480	numbered and unique.
5229480	5232740	Um, you could then trade those and sell them.
5232740	5234020	That's basically what this is.
5234020	5240100	You get a free little image of something and you're going to try to sell it for money.
5240100	5244960	And this is the thing, and again, NFT folks, this is, this is where my brain breaks down
5244960	5250160	because I go, but the steam marketplace, which has nothing to do with crypto, nothing to
5250160	5255580	do with NFT, the steam marketplace already has that where you buy and sell the cards,
5255580	5259660	buy and sell the emoji crafting, all this, all of that is already built into steam.
5259660	5261240	It doesn't need an NFT.
5261880	5266020	And I will understand before, again, I hear people typing in chat already.
5266020	5271820	I do understand that steam is centralized and maybe you don't like valve.
5271820	5273900	Maybe you don't like banks or all that stuff.
5273900	5278560	And then, uh, the, the NFTs and the crypto is all decentralized.
5278560	5282440	It's the Swiss bank of all this stuff for people too, with everybody getting ripped
5282440	5284520	off for thousands or millions of dollars.
5284520	5291140	But then my other thought is, is it really that outside when you have these big companies
5291140	5295960	that are still getting involved, like you're, you're sure, okay, you're doing the dealing
5295960	5300660	in crypto, but it's like, you're still passing the money through the NFT, the item through
5300660	5304020	Ubisoft one way or another.
5304020	5306620	It's like, are you really being that underground with it?
5306620	5307620	I don't know.
5307620	5308620	That's I guess what I don't get.
5308620	5309620	So anyway.
5309620	5314780	Well, um, you know, what we really should be looking at instead of NFTs, you know, in
5314780	5319700	Ubisoft games is why they haven't addressed the sexual harassment allegations that have
5319700	5322300	gone on for their company for the longest time.
5322300	5323300	Great question.
5323300	5329100	And, you know, because of that, you know, they're also having a surprisingly high turnover.
5329100	5333260	You don't say because, you know, they're saying that the pay isn't great.
5333260	5337940	Competitive opportunities are out there and they're freshly or frustrating, frustrated
5337940	5342360	at the handling of the scandals and pushing NFTs instead.
5342360	5343360	So
5343920	5350660	So Ubisoft's executives are telling the consumers what they want and not listening to what the
5350660	5358500	market is saying, and they're losing employees and, um, not able to keep the talent in house.
5358500	5365120	So honestly, all of the things that an executive is supposed to do, the executives are failing
5365120	5366120	at.
5366120	5367120	Is that correct at Ubisoft?
5367120	5368120	Yeah.
5368120	5370760	So Yves Guillemont has a fucking job.
5370760	5371760	Why?
5371760	5374620	Because if I don't do my fucking job, I get let go.
5374620	5377040	Why does Yves Guillemont have a fucking job?
5377040	5379220	I don't understand this industry sometimes.
5379220	5381040	I really don't.
5381040	5382200	It's fuck him.
5382200	5383760	Fuck Bobby Kotick.
5383760	5386220	Fuck a lot of these executives generally.
5386220	5390480	I mean, some some game companies are all right, but generally fuck a lot of these executives
5390480	5392480	are terrible.
5392480	5398840	Anyway, on that happy note, let's move on.
5398840	5402400	Let's talk about the Final Fantasy pixel remasters.
5402400	5406280	A lot of them are already available, but people are waiting for the big one.
5406280	5412840	I think four is kind of a big one, but six is really the one Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster.
5412840	5413840	When is it coming out?
5413840	5416640	And the answer is it's getting pushed back just a little bit.
5416640	5420760	It was supposed to be out this year, but Square is going to be bumping it back to February
5420760	5422420	2022.
5422420	5426740	And Square Enix is talking about that they need the time, need the extra time to apply
5426740	5427740	the final.
5427740	5428740	Oops.
5428740	5429740	Oops.
5429740	5430740	Sorry, guys.
5430740	5431740	I hit the wrong button.
5431740	5432740	We're not ready for that segment yet.
5432740	5433740	Sorry.
5433740	5435300	I meant to hit the down button.
5435300	5436300	Mistakes happen live.
5436300	5438380	That's why you tune in to hear all the mistakes.
5438380	5439380	All right.
5439380	5444540	So the Final Fantasy pixel remaster again, Final Fantasy 6 delayed to February 2022.
5444540	5449000	I mean, I guess Final Fantasy 6 is a classic game, so maybe the music was appropriate,
5449000	5451380	but it's not the selection for tonight.
5451380	5453380	All right.
5453380	5458660	So Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster will be out on PC, Steam, iOS, and Android in February
5458660	5460460	of 2022.
5460460	5464400	If you've already pre-purchased the game, Square Enix is trying to, and notice that's
5464400	5466580	pre-purchase, not pre-order.
5466580	5468860	That's already paid full price for the game.
5468860	5473740	You're going to get some extra soundtrack items, including time-lapse remixes of Locke's
5473740	5476940	theme, the Decisive Battle, Terra's theme, Searching for Friends.
5476940	5481940	A time-lapse remix is a soundtrack data that starts with the original version and blends
5481980	5484420	into the alternative soundtrack version.
5484420	5488420	And then, of course, two wallpapers talking about things that are pretty easy to see.
5488420	5489420	Wow.
5489420	5490420	Wallpapers.
5490420	5491420	I know, right?
5491420	5492420	Yeah, it's kind of, kind of...
5492420	5496140	Maybe I'll get a screensaver with it too.
5496140	5499140	Little flying toasters with Final Fantasy 6 pictures on them.
5499140	5500140	Yeah, exactly.
5500140	5508460	So anyway, and when I heard that news, I was like, all right, that will probably, let's
5508460	5514180	see, if that comes out in February, then that means E3 summer is about four months away.
5514180	5517820	That should be enough time for them to announce that they're going to take the Pixel remasters
5517820	5522700	and put them all out on consoles so we can finally have this on Switch, on PlayStation,
5522700	5525580	on Xbox maybe, and all that good stuff, right?
5525580	5526580	Right?
5526580	5527980	Because that's what I'm waiting for.
5527980	5529980	I hope so.
5529980	5530980	All right.
5530980	5531980	Moving on.
5531980	5533980	Dark Sakura.
5533980	5536940	An interesting one in the news news.
5536940	5540940	You're on mute.
5540940	5541940	So Dark Sakura.
5541940	5542940	Yeah.
5542940	5543940	Oh, there we go.
5543940	5544940	So this...
5544940	5548500	Well, I don't want to talk to anybody anyway.
5548500	5556460	So it had been brought up before how you could play video games on the touchscreen in a Tesla,
5556460	5557460	right?
5557460	5558460	Not anymore.
5558460	5564780	At least while it's in motion, they are no longer going to allow video games to be played
5564780	5567820	on the touchscreen when it's in motion.
5567820	5573820	This is after a safety investigation happened.
5573820	5578340	So basically, they put out a statement saying that...
5578340	5582020	I'm just going to read the quote following the opening of a preliminary evaluation of
5582020	5584580	Tesla's passenger play.
5584580	5592180	Hold on, they said, in a new software update, it will now be locked and unusable when the
5592180	5594740	vehicle is in motion.
5594740	5600500	So it's been something available since December 2020.
5600500	5605380	But as it is intended to be played by passengers, it hasn't always worked out that way.
5605380	5607460	There have been drivers playing it.
5607460	5613140	And so when you have people who are irresponsible, your toys get taken away.
5613140	5616340	And honestly, it shouldn't have been in the fucking thing to begin with.
5616340	5622060	Well, and to be clear, there are games in the device that were always meant to be played
5622060	5625380	while the car is charging, while the car is parked.
5625380	5626380	That sort of thing.
5626380	5632460	Because when you drive a Tesla, your gas stops, and I'm using my quotey fingers, often end
5632460	5634420	up being a little longer.
5634420	5636740	So the games is to give you something to do.
5636740	5641260	And there's video apps too, like Disney Plus and stuff on the Tesla, to help you pass the
5641260	5644700	time when you're at these stops getting the electricity.
5644700	5646660	And you might be wondering, why would I spend electricity?
5646660	5647660	Use your phone.
5647660	5650380	And some do, but it's fun to have it in the car too.
5650380	5651380	It's unnecessary.
5651380	5652380	I disagree.
5652380	5653380	100%.
5653380	5659660	No, it actually is literally not a necessary thing to have in a car.
5659660	5665220	What's necessary in a car is a speedometer, is your accelerator, is the things that are
5665220	5667540	used to control the car.
5667540	5668540	Air conditioner.
5668540	5669540	Those are necessary.
5669540	5670540	Okay.
5670540	5675540	Well, my opinion is, and I'd like to state my opinion, is that there is a benefit to
5675540	5679460	having these things in the vehicle for the charging amount of time.
5679460	5682940	And the people that I've talked to, the Tesla owners, when they're parked and stuff, it
5682940	5688100	is a nice alternative because perhaps they want to have something that they and the passenger
5688100	5692380	and the kids in the back seat can all participate in together, which you can't really do on
5692380	5693380	a phone.
5693380	5694380	So I don't think...
5694380	5697100	I also agree that air conditioners aren't necessary either.
5697100	5699100	So this is...
5699100	5700100	Body.
5700100	5701100	Okay.
5701100	5704060	Well then, when you purchase a cardboard box on wheels and that's your way to get around,
5704060	5705060	let us know.
5705060	5707620	I have a 69 Mustang, Rob.
5707620	5710180	Is that the car you actively drive right now?
5710180	5711180	It was.
5711180	5712180	Okay.
5712180	5713180	Anyway.
5713180	5714180	So...
5714180	5715500	But not in a long time.
5715500	5716500	All right.
5716500	5721460	So anyway, my point is with this is that this is meant to be played when the cars are in
5721460	5725740	park and all this stuff and you're resting at the stop and all this stuff.
5725740	5730060	For some reason, they got the bright idea like, oh, well, let's do this thing where
5730060	5732140	the passengers can play the games.
5732140	5735780	And there was only a few games, there's only like three of the games that people could
5735780	5736980	play as a passenger.
5736980	5740180	But as you mentioned, people couldn't follow the rules.
5740180	5742660	They just hit the button, confirm you're a passenger.
5742660	5743660	Yes, of course.
5743660	5744660	Yes, of course.
5744660	5746080	And then they're playing the games and no shit.
5746080	5747420	People got into trouble about that.
5747420	5751920	That was a dumb, dumb idea to have some of the games in passenger mode.
5751920	5755060	And I think there was a little bit of a standoff going on between the government and Tesla,
5755060	5757180	because this didn't even happen until just a couple of days ago.
5757180	5761820	We're finally in this game of Texas Hold'em, Tesla folded and said, all right, nevermind,
5761820	5764580	we're gonna turn it off because of what's going on.
5764580	5765580	Which yes, I agree.
5765580	5767060	Yes is a good thing.
5767060	5772100	But I don't see the harm in having it for its intended purpose of entertaining everybody
5772100	5773100	in the vehicle.
5773100	5776700	When honestly, and everything, everything I've talked to with Bobby and I know other
5776700	5781600	Tesla owners as well, the video game thing is a show off thing.
5781600	5784180	It's like, look, I can play Sonic in the car.
5784180	5785940	All right, that was fun.
5785940	5788900	It's like running Doom on a toaster.
5788900	5792100	You did it to say you did it, but you're not actually going to play all the way through
5792100	5795440	Doom on a toaster, unless you're that one person on the, there's always that one person
5795440	5796440	on Reddit.
5796440	5797600	I sped run Doom on a toaster.
5797600	5798600	Great.
5798600	5799600	Hooray for you.
5799600	5800880	We're also thrilled for you.
5800880	5806640	But for most people, it's not like something they take very seriously.
5806640	5812240	And to also tell Bobby, a radio doesn't fucking require that you look at it to interact with
5812240	5813240	it.
5813240	5814520	All right.
5814520	5820800	A lot of radio controls are now built into the wheel.
5820800	5823680	It's absolutely there as a distraction.
5823680	5826040	It is not a safety feature.
5826040	5831760	It's an entertainment, but item that can cause a real dangerous distraction to people.
5831760	5833720	All right.
5833720	5836560	Let's move on to our next story.
5836560	5837560	And Loki.
5837560	5839300	All right.
5839300	5844200	So it's just like, this is just the year that keeps on giving.
5844200	5849120	But now GameStop is apparently letting you pay with crypto.
5849120	5851560	Well, different crypto, I guess.
5851560	5856420	So they're taking even some meme cryptos as well.
5856420	5861380	So apparently, they've joined with flexa, which is a payment network that lets you use
5861380	5865360	different currency including dogecoin.
5865360	5871280	Yay, I have a use for dogecoin now.
5871280	5875120	Not sure what else they're gonna if they're taking like Shiba coin and stuff like that
5875120	5876120	now.
5876120	5884120	They're also doing mana, sand, and some other stuff.
5884120	5887360	But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what other cryptocurrencies they take.
5887360	5891020	But I think it's just kind of a gimmick.
5891020	5893460	And it's all through this third party thing, right?
5893460	5898160	So it's not like GameStop employees are actually having to necessarily learn about cryptocurrency
5898160	5902720	outside of how to process a different type of payment in an app or something like that,
5902720	5903720	right?
5903720	5904720	Yeah.
5904720	5909840	And they're also taking Shiba coin, so they do take that, I am seeing that now, Bitcoin
5909840	5911840	and Litecoin.
5911840	5919360	Okay, so to be fair, so I talked kind of blah on the NFT stuff earlier.
5919360	5922640	Now let's say something positive about the whole crypto thing.
5922640	5929440	This is the end game for that market is the ability to use crypto to get goods and services
5929440	5932280	of which, say what you will about GameStop.
5932280	5936620	They provide a goods and service that a lot of people are super into.
5936620	5938520	So this is the end game for that.
5938520	5943640	So it's interesting, I mean, I don't know if I'm ready to make a payment.
5943640	5946460	The thing is, those things are so volatile.
5946460	5952320	That's like right now, the amount of these are so volatile, it's like gambling.
5952320	5954960	It's like you perpetually have money in a slot machine.
5954960	5956960	When you win, you win, good for you.
5956960	5960880	And you can turn that around and put it right back into GameStop or whatever it is.
5960880	5965120	But I just, I don't like to hold my money there right now.
5965120	5970000	But if there was some stability and things like that, maybe I'd be more inclined to do
5970000	5971000	it.
5971000	5972000	I don't know.
5972000	5975520	So yeah, that's interesting.
5975520	5978800	So I don't think I'll be making crypto payments to GameStop anytime soon, though.
5978800	5983200	But neat, I guess, for those that maybe have a little bit more in their wallet.
5983200	5985840	All right, moving on.
5985840	5989920	Let's talk about, oh, this is one of my favorite retro companies.
5989960	5994280	And I know they're sitting on some good properties, and that is Sunsoft.
5994280	6000120	And Sunsoft is looking at maybe doing more of their retro catalog as remakes.
6000120	6004480	And of course, one of the big ones, yeah, hell yeah, one of the big ones, Quest, baby.
6004480	6005480	I wish.
6005480	6007600	I mean, there's a little more licensing that comes into that.
6007600	6010520	But I also, Blaster Master's the big one.
6010520	6013680	But Blaster Master Zero, hello, is already a thing.
6013680	6015120	And they've actually done three of them.
6015120	6018440	So they did that first one that was kind of a loose remake of the first game.
6018440	6021960	And now it's spun off into its own trilogy that, you know, obviously the second game
6021960	6026520	doesn't, as far as I know, really tie to the Genesis one or anything that otherwise was
6026520	6027520	in canon.
6027520	6029360	But it kind of does its own thing, and it's done it well.
6029360	6036320	Like it's a good trilogy, and in my opinion, Inti Creates kind of did a real bang up job
6036320	6038640	with a retro property done right.
6038640	6040680	I would love to see them take on others.
6040680	6046360	Well, Sunsoft on their Twitter account, Sunsoft Games wrote a tweet this week that said, hope
6046360	6053640	your holiday season is fun and festive, BTW, that's internet speak for by the way, we're
6053640	6057400	thinking about remaking our retro titles in the near future.
6057400	6059800	Could you tell us which ones you'd prefer?
6059800	6065040	If you have any, shout us out on Twitter using Sunsoft Games, we'll refer to them.
6065040	6066320	Thanks all.
6066320	6069880	And of course, actually, I am curious, what kind of replies are they getting?
6069880	6070880	Hold on.
6070880	6073120	I want to read some of these replies here by going over to Twitter.
6073120	6077520	I don't really remember anything other than like, they had, you know, Blaster Master,
6077520	6078520	was it?
6078520	6087840	Do they have, what was that game, nevermind, I lost it.
6087840	6092360	Here's to help you remember, here's some of the replies they're getting.
6092360	6095520	Journey to Silius is in the first reply.
6095520	6099200	And I do remember, I think Dark Soccer may have highlighted that as a game of the week
6099200	6100200	ones.
6100200	6101200	I did for music.
6101200	6102200	Oh, the music.
6102280	6106040	Because that was one that was, like, it was supposed to be a Terminator game and didn't,
6106040	6108040	like, that was the whole story behind that, right?
6108040	6109040	I think.
6109040	6111280	So that was a big one.
6111280	6114480	They're mentioning 53 stations of the Tokaido.
6114480	6116560	That's obscure.
6116560	6117560	Yeah.
6117560	6119280	The wing of Medulla Heberike.
6119280	6127280	Let's see, I'm trying to see some more that they have here on the list.
6127280	6130640	Somebody brought up that they did do the Batman NES and Famicom games.
6130640	6131640	That is true.
6132080	6134280	Obviously the licensing would be a little harder now at this point.
6134280	6141040	So there is that, lots of people in the replies saying Heberike, Gimmick, and so forth.
6141040	6145600	But you're right, I have a hard time remembering what they had outside of Blaster Master that
6145600	6150900	wasn't a more complicated license, like you say, the Fester's Quest and that whole sort
6150900	6151900	of thing.
6151900	6157680	So yeah, and DJ Rama S kind of lights that up saying, ooh, Journey to Silius.
6157680	6160140	Yeah, I think there's a lot of people that would be very into that.
6160140	6162060	So who knows?
6162060	6164340	It could be something that gets approached later.
6164340	6167820	All right, Sunsoft is taking all your ideas right now.
6167820	6172100	All right, a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
6172100	6175540	But first, Dark Sakura.
6175540	6177380	There's another mini arcade machine coming out.
6177380	6179700	It's the Taito Egret 2 mini.
6179700	6186020	It's supposed to be coming out in 2022 with 40 different arcade games in it.
6186020	6188020	I don't see what the list is.
6188900	6194620	Arcanoid, Strike Bowling, Plump Pop.
6194620	6195620	So yeah, there you go.
6195620	6198700	If you like mini arcade cabinets, go get one.
6198700	6201260	I do love mini arcade cabinets.
6201260	6202980	There's just so many of them now.
6202980	6205820	It's hard to figure out which ones I want to get more than others.
6205820	6209780	We just last week had that vertical Sega one that's on its way out too.
6209780	6211780	So there's just a lot of good ones.
6211780	6214180	So it's the time to be a collector.
6214180	6216260	All right, Loki.
6216980	6223380	All right, so if I don't know when we're going to have this has been one of those things
6223380	6226140	we were talking about, when are we going to get a date for this?
6226140	6230060	But apparently, the Call of Duty studio, that's
6230060	6235980	which one they're like all Call of Duty studios, Treyarch has
6235980	6238860	vaguely promised to do better
6238860	6244220	regarding all the sexual harassment, sexism and bullying
6244260	6249780	notices that have been going out about all sorts of areas in Activision.
6249780	6252820	Our goal as a studio is to make awesome games for the world to enjoy,
6252820	6254100	having the privilege to pursue.
6254100	6258740	And that endeavor is made possible because of Treyarch people.
6258740	6262220	We are a studio comprised of smart, talented, world class creative professionals.
6262220	6263980	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6263980	6267780	Our culture has no room for sexism, harassment, racism, bigotry,
6267780	6270020	discrimination or bullying.
6270020	6271900	But yet we find a way.
6271940	6273740	As we move forward, I added that part.
6273740	6278260	As we move forward, providing a safe, diverse, inclusive working environment
6278260	6282460	so that many will thrive will be our highest priority.
6282460	6284460	Cool. How are you going to do that?
6285180	6286860	Yeah. How about some details?
6286860	6289900	How about some some, you know, things besides words?
6289900	6291540	How is it meaningful action?
6291540	6293260	I think is a good way to put it.
6293260	6295740	Yeah. So we'll see.
6295740	6298140	Promises. Hmm. All right.
6298980	6304780	And our last story tonight is this is kind of sad.
6304780	6309100	It's an arcade we've all here at OLR actually been to once.
6309100	6310780	I know we went here once. Yeah.
6310780	6314020	Seattle Gameworks is going to be closing.
6314020	6317460	And some folks say, oh, this is from The Last of Us, too,
6317460	6321060	because the arcade was actually in the fourth chapter of the game.
6321060	6322420	You know, a likeness of it.
6322420	6325020	But the actual arcade and a lot of people know this arcade, too,
6325020	6326740	because it's across the street
6326740	6330580	ish from the Washington Convention Center where Pax has been for forever.
6330740	6333860	And that's how Loki Dark Soccer and I all went there once,
6333860	6338420	because we all went to Pax together once in two thousand eight question mark.
6339100	6341740	Because, yeah, I think it was the year I had the surgeries and all that stuff.
6341740	6344620	I was pretty sick, but was able to squeeze Pax in between that.
6344620	6345740	Yeah, it was a great trip.
6345740	6348620	And I think a lot of people know that game works
6348620	6350740	probably from going to Pax or something like that.
6350980	6353460	And certainly if you look at like the music game roots
6353460	6355540	and all that stuff of the show,
6355540	6358420	you know, there was a big DDR scene there at one point.
6358940	6361740	And maybe still to this day, as far as I know,
6361900	6365860	I know they had like a pop music there when I visited my most recent trip,
6365860	6367940	which was like maybe four or five years ago at this point.
6367940	6370140	But, you know, I know they still had some stuff.
6370620	6372900	It's very reminiscent of like
6372900	6377500	a Dave and Busters or, you know, one of those large arcades.
6377740	6381180	And obviously pandemic has probably made it a little bit harder to operate.
6381220	6383380	That's certainly a part of it.
6383380	6387060	And just the general decline of arcades in general.
6387540	6389580	Tigerclaw is pointing out to Seattle.
6389580	6391700	Gameworks isn't the only one that's closing.
6391700	6393460	So is the one in Las Vegas.
6393460	6396900	And I had heard that possibly it's an issue with the entire chain.
6397740	6400900	So there is there's that.
6400900	6404700	Yeah, Gameworks as a company is shuttering, according to this report.
6404700	6408500	And again, it's it's probably just a victim of the pandemic, which is sad.
6408900	6413220	So, yep, several tweets
6413220	6416420	out there about this, how the word got out of some of the employees were
6417660	6420220	kind of letting the news out and all that.
6420220	6423340	They're trying to this is interesting, is that one of the folks
6423340	6427220	that was talking about the news online, who was
6428260	6433060	see the composer from Get in the Car Loser, Krista Lee,
6433540	6436740	is saying that she's assisting the Video Game History Foundation
6436740	6438820	in preserving what we can of the place.
6439100	6441860	Well, that's kind of interesting to kind of work with the History Foundation
6441860	6444700	and maybe get some of those machines.
6444700	6447380	They are saying, too, that the Seattle location could be managed
6447380	6449500	by the landlord if they were interested.
6449500	6453860	But unknown if that I mean, that's a that's a real prime piece of real estate
6454700	6457060	right there. That is the heart of downtown Seattle.
6458180	6459860	And I know what it's right across the street.
6459860	6463020	If I remember right, like the convention center, the Hyatt is right there
6463020	6464900	with the big cheesecake factory.
6464900	6467660	Everybody packs probably now once is right there.
6467820	6470100	It's it's right in the heart of downtown Seattle.
6470100	6473180	And I just it's going to be probably hard to keep a valuable piece of real
6473180	6475980	estate like that, especially if it wasn't making the money
6475980	6477540	that it needed to to stay open.
6477540	6479820	So. Very, very sad.
6480380	6482820	So. All right.
6482820	6486140	Let's see. And She-Hulk 10 says Alamo is closing as well.
6486140	6489300	A great movie theater that shows cool independent movies and festive nights.
6489300	6492060	Really? I didn't hear that. That's sad.
6492060	6493700	That's unfortunate.
6494780	6498700	All right. So goodbye to Seattle Game Works.
6499700	6501420	And that large, large
6503500	6506540	real estate they were working with, there's a lot of crane machines in there, too.
6506540	6509340	I remember that kind of look like around one, there were so many.
6510260	6513260	All right. Let's get into our next segment
6513260	6516860	to remember Fonder times at Game Works or otherwise.
6516860	6531980	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive
6531980	6535420	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6535780	6538500	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6539260	6543460	And what did you pick here on Episode 897 Dark Soccer for the classic game?
6544300	6546460	I think Brave Fencer Musashi also.
6548460	6551580	Musashi Den, which is the legend of Musashi.
6552100	6556300	It's an action roleplay game that came out by Square in 1998 for PlayStation.
6557740	6560900	I think the big thing with this is that
6562380	6565340	I want to say that this was the
6566460	6571420	the same demo for Final Fantasy 7, if I recall correctly.
6572100	6575740	It was it was kind of a thing with that.
6575740	6578900	Yeah, this was like a on the same demo disc, if I'm right.
6578900	6582380	Or that a demo for Final Fantasy 7 came with it one way or another.
6582380	6584460	They were related to each other. I'll have to look it back up again.
6584460	6586300	Yeah, it was seven or eight. One of the two.
6586300	6588380	It was seven. No, it was seven. I know that.
6588380	6591220	I just don't remember if seven was the demo or if this was the demo.
6592540	6594420	Oh, yeah. OK, I got you.
6596220	6599020	In any way, I want to say that seven was the demo with this one,
6599860	6602820	because there was some big thing about why everyone wanted it.
6603660	6606740	But you play as Musashi,
6607420	6611500	who is a swordman who is summoned to a parallel world
6612740	6617020	to defend from the Thirst Quencher empire.
6617500	6620340	And he's searching for different scrolls that enhance his sword
6620340	6622820	and interact with people in the world.
6624420	6628820	And it was a big departure from Square's roleplay games.
6629380	6632100	It was a very positively received game.
6633820	6636940	And he had like these sort of
6638460	6641180	different chain attacks that he could do
6641180	6643500	with his katana that was called Fusion.
6645140	6648500	And it was it was a pretty, pretty neat little game.
6648500	6652620	You know, you could go in and sleep or go to an inn to recover your energy.
6652620	6655140	Some very RPG like elements in it.
6656140	6665460	But he's a reincarnation of the legendary Brave Fencer Musashi.
6666900	6671740	And he goes, his reincarnated self goes back to to save that world.
6673340	6678660	It was developed in February 1997 by Sakaguchi Hironobu.
6679740	6681820	He's a producer, came up with the idea
6682820	6685660	by having the the real person,
6686140	6690780	Miyamoto Musashi, to fight in an alternate world
6690780	6692380	that he's actually came from.
6692380	6693980	So that's kind of where it came about.
6695700	6700220	And then there's also another character in there named Kojiro,
6700220	6704500	who is based off of the swordsman Sasaki Kojiro.
6704700	6709660	And for anyone who is a Pokemon fan, the original names of Jesse
6709740	6712340	and James are Musashi and Kojiro.
6713140	6716300	So I just thought I would point that out.
6717420	6722340	Anyway, so the characters, you know, in the game have like that similar
6724140	6726340	rivalry in it.
6726780	6730180	So anyway, they.
6732580	6734620	The game was, of course,
6734620	6736860	the name of the game was changed to Brave Fencer Musashi
6736860	6741260	instead of Brave Fencer Colu Musashiden, because people would
6742260	6745380	they feared that that non-Japanese speakers would just say,
6745380	6748260	oh, his name is Musashiden. No, no, no, not really.
6750180	6753180	It it has 78 tracks
6753260	6757060	on its soundtrack, a pretty, pretty impressive soundtrack.
6757860	6762700	It was released in Japan on July 16th, 1998,
6762700	6766620	and re-released June 20th, 2000 with Square's Millennium Collection.
6767140	6769900	It also came with merchandise that included postcards,
6769900	6772540	a combination camera and cell phone strap,
6773260	6775660	a handy strap and keychain fobs.
6776380	6779980	And then it came out on PlayStation Network on July 9th, 2008
6779980	6781620	in the North American market.
6781620	6784580	It was released October 31st, 1998.
6786420	6789940	And yes, this had OK, so I was actually wrong on this.
6789940	6791740	This had the demo of Final Fantasy 8.
6791740	6794220	OK, I remembered the error is eight.
6795060	6797100	I thought that it was Final Fantasy 7,
6797100	6799540	because I remember this game being older than it is.
6800140	6802980	Yeah, the 7 had already been out and it was
6803300	6805860	I remember it because I did get that game.
6805900	6807020	Well, I got that.
6807020	6810140	One of the reasons I got that was because of the demo, for sure.
6810500	6813380	Yeah, it did have a sequel,
6813860	6816100	which was Musashi Samurai Legend.
6816100	6821420	It came out for PS2, developed by Squenix and was released in 2005.
6822020	6826220	They also released a montage video that celebrated the game's 20th
6826220	6829900	anniversary since release on July 16th, 2018.
6830500	6833860	The game for Metacritic got an 81 out of 100.
6835860	6839020	And Famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40,
6839020	6840900	which is a really good rating for Famitsu.
6842420	6847260	It really got some some really good reviews overall,
6847260	6851500	and the game still remains a favorite for for everybody,
6851780	6852940	for a lot of people that played it.
6852940	6854820	And if you haven't played it, why the fuck not?
6856500	6859580	Because I didn't know anyone who had it, and I didn't own it myself.
6860540	6863220	I actually never played this.
6863220	6864260	It's a good game.
6864260	6866140	Yeah, it looks cute. Definitely checking out.
6866140	6870500	Yeah, it's definitely a PS1 era game, you know, from the graphics and all.
6870500	6874140	But I noticed YYR kind of I think it's YYR in chat was saying kind of like
6874620	6878500	it's it's a special something from Square's PS1 era
6878500	6880660	where they kind of did a lot of different things.
6881220	6882740	And I can definitely see that in this.
6882740	6885780	I can tell you what game I think took some influence from this
6886700	6889500	was at least in like kind of what we're seeing
6889500	6891780	in this particular area in the game.
6892460	6894940	Maybe Klonoa took some influence from it.
6894940	6897700	Oh, maybe I could see that.
6897700	6899660	Yeah. All right.
6899700	6903540	I mean, and honestly, for when this game came out, it did a lot.
6905100	6908020	Yeah, it was pretty advanced for its time. Yeah.
6909940	6911180	But anyway, that's it.
6911180	6913260	All right. There it is, your classic game.
6913260	6915500	I don't know if this came out before Klonoa.
6915500	6916540	I have to check that.
6916540	6919460	Hold on. That's going to bug me until I look at it, because
6921060	6923900	that's why I came out.
6925020	6926740	Klonoa came out in.
6926740	6929980	OK, so actually, yeah, Klonoa came out first.
6930020	6930700	OK, so that's right.
6930700	6932980	So maybe this took influence from Klonoa then.
6932980	6935380	Possibly. Klonoa came out in 87.
6937300	6940380	All right. There it is, your classic game of the week.
6940380	6942980	Brave Fencer Musashi.
6942980	6945140	Awesome. All right.
6945140	6948140	I thought we'd check in with release dates around the world.
6948140	6950140	I'm not sure if there is anything out this week,
6950140	6952660	but I thought I would have us all look at the calendar anyway.
6952660	6956900	So, Loki, do we have anything in the U.S. releasing this week?
6957620	6959740	Nope. Nope.
6959740	6961620	Looking at Japan.
6962020	6964340	I see some peripherals for the Switch,
6964340	6966580	but I don't think I see any games this week.
6966580	6969020	So it is a quiet week.
6969020	6970940	What about the UK Dark Sakura?
6970940	6973060	No. Yeah, there it is.
6973060	6974940	The one week of the year.
6974940	6976500	Nothing's coming out.
6976500	6978260	Everybody's taking a siesta.
6978260	6980580	Next week, though, I'm sure that will change.
6980580	6983260	OK, here's an opportunity for the listener roundtable.
6983260	6984780	If you'd like to give us a call.
6984780	6988020	Sure, we can take a call or two in our Discord, vognetwork.com
6988020	6989540	slash Discord.
6989540	6991700	If you'd like to join the green room is the place to be
6991700	6993820	if you want to get in on the conversation.
6993820	6995660	We also check our emails.
6995660	6996900	I feel like we have another.
6996900	6998700	There's like three dry weeks in a row, I think.
6998700	7001540	But I didn't even bring up the mailbag.
7001540	7002700	Hold on.
7002700	7004500	I'm not sure I saw anything.
7004500	7006940	But yeah, please double check because sometimes things
7006940	7010020	come in like at the top of the show that I don't see.
7010020	7012020	So I'm liking it.
7012020	7012700	No worries.
7012700	7016020	Again, participate at OrangeLoundTrader.com
7016020	7018140	is the place to send an email.
7018180	7022620	If you would like to get in on the action.
7022620	7023500	All right.
7023500	7026660	To quote the best line from Spaceballs,
7026660	7029260	we ain't found shit.
7029260	7033380	That was Tim Russ that said that from Star Trek Voyager.
7033380	7035180	When they were combing the desert.
7035180	7037660	That's right.
7037660	7039340	DJ Rama S says he's going to call in.
7039340	7041740	So we'll just send that in our chat over at Twitch.tv
7041740	7042420	slash vognetwork.
7042420	7043260	So we'll give him a moment.
7043260	7044140	I will check in.
7044140	7046620	I know I'm going to say this as I'm half laughing.
7046660	7049060	Do we have any last minute stories tonight?
7049060	7049940	Nope.
7049940	7051780	I had a feeling.
7051780	7055380	We were kind of having to scrape what was available to us
7055380	7057380	tonight on a slow week.
7057380	7060460	Well, I do hope everybody's having a great holiday season.
7060460	7062860	I hope you all have some good New Year's plans.
7062860	7067860	I know with the big old Omicron out there and all that stuff,
7067860	7071740	some people are having to adjust appropriately and I get it.
7071740	7073260	It seems definitely frustrating.
7073260	7074500	It's like two years in a row.
7074500	7077980	But yeah, just be safe y'all this holiday season.
7077980	7081260	I hope everybody has a good New Year's no matter
7081260	7082820	how you spend it.
7082820	7085500	YYR was saying I was thinking of emailing because Nintendo
7085500	7087060	Minute was mentioned last week.
7087060	7089500	I heard it ended because Nintendo was closing the site
7089500	7092460	where those two folks worked and they were unwilling to relocate
7092460	7093900	but I decided it wasn't worth it.
7093900	7095820	I thought they said in the press release
7095820	7099860	those guys were being relocated or was that or that they're
7099860	7101180	being reallocated.
7101180	7102780	Maybe not necessarily relocated.
7102820	7105500	Just taking on different roles in the company.
7105500	7110260	Yeah, that might also be a same thing to say face.
7110260	7112860	Bonds006 says Epic Games Store has been giving away games
7112860	7113900	every 12 hours.
7113900	7115380	We kind of addressed that at the top of the show.
7115380	7117500	I gave the PSA the control is free right now.
7117500	7123500	It's every 24 hours unless something changed in the today
7123500	7125660	or something but I think it's just every 24 hours.
7125660	7127780	Every eight might be a little too often.
7127780	7131220	We do have a call coming in so let's get to it and say hi.
7131220	7132460	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
7132460	7134340	Who's this?
7134340	7135740	It's the one and only Rama.
7135740	7137060	How is everybody today?
7137060	7138180	Doing well.
7138180	7139380	What a surprise.
7139380	7140860	It's not like you said in chat or anything
7140860	7141660	you were going to call in.
7141660	7143780	But no, it's always a pleasure to hear from Rama.
7143780	7144300	Hi.
7144300	7145580	Oh, your setup looks different.
7145580	7148580	Are you somewhere else for the holiday?
7148580	7150060	Actually, I am home.
7150060	7153180	I am not in front of my professional rig.
7153180	7158500	I am at the other side of my quote unquote studio apartment
7159340	7161900	on my laptop with my external camera.
7161900	7163420	OK, camera's facing a different way.
7163420	7164260	All good.
7164260	7166140	Well, what's on your mind today, buddy?
7166140	7168620	Well, I want to follow up with an article
7168620	7171820	that you talked about on the show a couple of weeks ago.
7171820	7174580	Which one?
7174580	7176260	Stadia.
7176260	7177940	Oh, sure.
7177940	7179820	So what I'm going to do, I'm going
7179820	7184540	to turn my webcam to my LG TV.
7184540	7185220	OK.
7185220	7188260	And I'm going to turn it on because after you
7188260	7191580	talked about it on the show, I'm like, I got to try this
7191580	7193700	and see if this works for myself.
7193700	7197660	So I'm going to go ahead and turn everything on
7197660	7200100	and get it up and running here because I was playing around
7200100	7204260	with it earlier to make sure I got it working because it
7204260	7205940	is finicky with controllers.
7205940	7207900	But I kind of got something going.
7207900	7211820	So let's bring the television up.
7211820	7212780	Everything is set.
7215540	7217380	I just turn on the Xbox to make sure
7217420	7219220	that the TV and everything comes on.
7219220	7221700	But here we go.
7221700	7223300	I'm going to do this for the Twitch folks
7223300	7225700	to make it a little easier to see what you're doing there.
7225700	7228260	Oh, of course, it's going to screw up my thing.
7228260	7230580	Sorry, you've seen a little of the magic there.
7230580	7232940	But I'm actually going to make Rama's screen a little bit
7232940	7234860	bigger there so you guys can actually
7234860	7236820	see what's going on there.
7236820	7237540	There we go.
7237540	7238020	Yeah.
7242180	7242700	There we go.
7242700	7243620	I'm going to log in.
7243620	7245940	So for the sake of the podcast, folks,
7245940	7247460	there's just a Stadia logo that we
7247460	7249060	see kind of glowing and loading.
7249060	7254660	So it just looks like the system is just going very slow there.
7254660	7258540	It's slow, but yet my TV is hardwired to the router
7258540	7260260	that's sitting behind the TV.
7260260	7262380	OK.
7262380	7264540	And as you can see, I kind of played around with it
7264540	7265940	earlier with Dirt 5.
7265940	7270940	So I signed up, did the one month free of pro.
7270940	7272900	So I'm like, let me go through all of these games
7272900	7275340	and just try them out.
7275340	7276900	Yeah.
7276900	7280260	Hey, I found pro worth paying for.
7280260	7283700	Well, with all of the video games that I have bought,
7283700	7285940	I'm not keeping pro because I don't
7285940	7288700	know how often I'm going to jump on here and play it.
7288700	7291900	I just heard that Rob said it was free.
7291900	7295020	I'm like, I got to try this out, load it onto my TV,
7295020	7296260	and just see.
7296260	7300180	How does it run once you play a game?
7300180	7301500	Here's the thing.
7301540	7305340	It's fast because I have gigabit internet
7305340	7307900	and my TV is hardwired to the router that's
7307900	7309420	literally behind the TV.
7309420	7310900	So let me.
7310900	7314660	It really is when you're hardwired.
7314660	7316620	And the thing is, I could have made it wireless,
7316620	7317220	but I'm like, you know what?
7317220	7318300	The router is right there.
7318300	7319860	So I have extra cabling.
7319860	7320780	So why not?
7320780	7323260	So I'm just going to fire up a game real quick.
7323260	7323740	OK.
7329500	7331220	Zen Monkey in chat says, what is he doing?
7331220	7331740	I'm lost.
7331740	7334180	He's firing up Stadia on his LG TV
7334180	7336980	as we had an article a couple of weeks ago that Stadia is now
7336980	7339060	available for LG TVs.
7339060	7341220	So Rama's kind of walking us through a little bit
7341220	7342580	kind of what it looks like there.
7342580	7344700	This is, again, integrated into the TV.
7344700	7347740	He's not using some sort of console or anything like that.
7347740	7350460	And that's why the focus is getting a little screwy
7350460	7352780	is because he's using, he's pointed his laptop
7352780	7354500	webcam at the screen.
7354500	7356940	But again, our podcast listeners can't even see anything.
7356940	7359060	But we'll just mention, it looks like he fired up Killer Queen
7359060	7362060	Black, and it's just going through all the logos
7362060	7364100	that you would see at the start of a game.
7364100	7366140	It looks like it's still a little fuzzy, Rama.
7366140	7367140	I don't know if you just want to wave
7367140	7370020	your hand in front of the camera to get it to autofocus again.
7370020	7372620	Yeah, it's my, see, this is why I don't
7372620	7374140	trust Logitech equipment.
7374140	7376180	Yeah, it's a lighting thing at this point.
7376180	7377740	All right, all right, that's all right.
7377740	7379140	But we get the idea.
7379140	7381300	I was just kind of curious like how smooth it
7381300	7383460	is, you know, in that whole thing.
7383460	7387660	I would say it is because I didn't feel any slowdowns when
7387660	7389220	I was playing Dirt 5.
7389220	7394380	So like I said, I just fired up Killer Queen Black.
7394380	7395620	It's just me.
7395620	7398780	I have no clue what I am doing.
7398780	7403980	So I'm just sitting here just playing through this.
7403980	7406580	Now, you mentioned that the controller was kind of a pain
7406580	7407240	to get set up.
7407240	7410380	Can you mention like what the pain points were with that?
7410380	7416020	Well, as you know, basically any controller works on any PC.
7416020	7418900	You would think that any controller
7418900	7424620	would work great on Stadia through an appliance.
7424620	7429040	You have to understand that LG uses what's called WebOS,
7429040	7432340	and that's not really Android per se.
7432340	7434980	It's its own little operating system.
7434980	7438180	So what I did was I fired it up.
7438180	7443480	I plugged in a wired switch controller.
7443480	7445120	I got nothing.
7445120	7448720	So I had a special adapter that converts any controller
7448720	7451400	to Xbox, and I tried that.
7451400	7452240	Nothing.
7452240	7455880	Tried a different USB port, nada, nothing.
7455880	7457480	That didn't work either.
7457480	7461640	So I decided to break out my PlayStation 4 controller,
7461640	7463920	plug it into the adapter, nothing.
7463920	7465380	And I'm looking at the instructions.
7465380	7470560	I'm like, wait, it's supposed to work with Xbox 360, Xbox One,
7470560	7473200	PS4, and certain Logitech controllers.
7473200	7476560	So I took out the adapter, plugged in the PlayStation 4
7476560	7481080	controller directly, and it's working.
7481080	7484760	Well, glad you got it somehow.
7484760	7488800	Like I said, the load time on this was pretty quick.
7488800	7491200	But it's just kind of getting to the Stadia
7491200	7494000	menu that took a hot minute.
7494000	7496000	Kind of, sort of.
7496000	7500840	Like if I turn on the TV, I hit the Home button on the remote,
7500840	7502780	there's an icon for Stadia right there.
7502780	7505180	It takes like maybe less than two minutes for it
7505180	7508300	to load up and get things up and running.
7508300	7509840	And when you're playing on a computer,
7509840	7511580	it's going to be a little bit different since it's
7511580	7512940	opening right up in Chrome.
7512940	7514020	Sure.
7514020	7518400	Like right now, when I open my Chrome,
7518400	7522780	it opens right to Dead by Daylight and launches the game.
7522780	7526460	Because I have, that was, I never quit out of the game
7526460	7529460	unless I'm going to play something else.
7529460	7532140	So I haven't seen it work on the TV
7532180	7536460	before because I've never played it on anything but on my Mac.
7536460	7538820	Which of course, it recognizes whatever I have plugged
7538820	7539820	into my Mac at the time.
7539820	7542180	I haven't tried my controller.
7542180	7547460	I just found my wired controller.
7547460	7549980	Hey, see, the thing is, I think it'll
7549980	7552580	work for Mac because of direct input support.
7552580	7556740	So as long as Stadia likes that, it's fine.
7556740	7560100	I think because this is web OS and the way it's coded,
7560140	7562760	it's going to work on certain controllers.
7562760	7565860	Because when I plugged in my controller or the adapter,
7565860	7568800	it did say, you know, kid device detected.
7568800	7570780	I'm like, okay, let's give it a shot.
7570780	7571720	So, you know.
7574380	7577460	So Rama, thank you for the walkthrough of Stadia on the TV.
7577460	7580300	It's kind of nice to just be able to see that in motion.
7580300	7582220	I do have another call waiting to get in.
7582220	7583740	So I want to get that, but first,
7583740	7586500	any other final thoughts for us before we get to that?
7587220	7592260	Um, my Chinese food was bland for Christmas,
7592260	7593820	so I'm not too thrilled about that.
7593820	7595140	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
7595140	7595940	Sorry to hear that.
7595940	7599300	You have to have Dark Sakura send you some tarts.
7599300	7600620	They were divine.
7600620	7601980	I have one left.
7601980	7603740	They're mine.
7603740	7607220	Well, I'm not going to fight for a tart, OK?
7607220	7608260	No, no.
7608260	7609300	I'll pass you my tart.
7609300	7610580	My tart recipe is easy.
7610580	7613540	You buy puff pastry from the grocery store,
7613540	7615940	and you buy marmalade from the grocery store,
7615940	7617460	and you bake them.
7617460	7618060	It was good.
7618060	7619620	Sounds good.
7619620	7621260	That'll give us something Marco's trying to do
7621260	7623180	while we help her move next Sunday.
7623180	7623940	Oh, boy.
7623940	7626460	Remember, friends help friends move.
7626460	7628540	Real friends help friends move bodies.
7628540	7631620	What makes you think I haven't moved a body already?
7631620	7634860	All right, before we get terms of service violated,
7634860	7635940	it's hyperbole.
7635940	7637860	They are speaking in hyperbole.
7637860	7639900	All right, that's going to do it, Rama.
7639900	7641140	Thank you so much for the call.
7641140	7642580	I appreciate it.
7642580	7643020	Thank you.
7643020	7644660	Take care, y'all, and Happy New Year.
7644660	7645380	Same to you.
7645420	7646180	Happy New Year.
7646180	7647220	Bye bye.
7647220	7648220	All right.
7648220	7650940	We have another call waiting, so let's just bring them on in.
7650940	7652340	Sorry the video is a little funky,
7652340	7654340	but we'll fix it right now as we welcome another person.
7654340	7654940	Hi.
7654940	7656180	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7656180	7656780	Who's this?
7660540	7661060	Hi.
7661060	7664580	You might be muted or we don't hear you.
7664580	7666020	Wait, I thought I brought someone.
7666020	7666860	They left right away.
7666860	7667300	That's what happened.
7667300	7668180	Let's try this again.
7668180	7669660	It's like, why did the picture change?
7669660	7670020	Hi.
7670020	7671180	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7671180	7671900	Who's this?
7671900	7673140	Hey, it's Shane.
7673140	7673660	Hey, Shane.
7673660	7674860	What's up?
7674860	7679300	I'm calling to complain because I don't have anything to complain to.
7679300	7679900	No, no.
7679900	7682340	It's actually, I think it's kind of an interesting thing.
7682340	7683340	OK.
7683340	7684300	Oh, it's not about me.
7684300	7686500	Oh, finally, what a change.
7686500	7688780	We'll wait for the show on Wednesday for that.
7691100	7696580	No, so this is about our favorite company, Konami, actually.
7696580	7697980	Oh, no.
7697980	7701180	What is there to complain about there?
7701180	7703220	It's worse than I was expecting.
7703220	7704060	Let's just say that.
7704060	7708220	So my local arcade got a 2DX machine.
7708220	7709980	I'm super excited about that.
7709980	7711060	Started playing it.
7711060	7714780	Kind of rekindled my love for 2DX.
7714780	7722700	Saw my cousin playing 2DX Infinitus, which is the computer version.
7722700	7724060	I'm not sure if you've heard of that.
7724060	7724300	OK.
7724300	7724580	I have.
7724580	7725220	The PC one.
7725220	7726540	Yeah, we've gotten emails on it before.
7726540	7729940	I haven't played it myself, but I'm familiar that Konami's tried to launch.
7729940	7731380	They just recently did DER.
7731380	7732980	We've heard a lot about.
7733020	7735540	They have an online DDR one, yeah.
7735540	7738340	Yeah, they also have sound Voltex.
7738340	7742020	But we'll stick to 2DX for a moment here.
7742020	7744020	So I'm just getting really interested.
7744020	7751180	So one of the things we did for Christmas is we ordered me a fancy 2DX controller.
7751180	7754980	Not very cheap to begin with, but it was cool.
7754980	7756220	I'll have a controller.
7756220	7759220	I can play 2DX on my computer.
7759260	7766540	Infinitus is about $15 a month, which is just another subscription service, whatever.
7766540	7773700	But the problem is I didn't know that they sell ridiculously overpriced song packs.
7773700	7775860	And there's about 20 of them.
7775860	7779020	And that's where the bulk of the music content comes from.
7779020	7784860	And each song pack, 25 songs roughly, $60 each.
7784860	7785860	Wow.
7785860	7786380	Wowie.
7786380	7787780	Yeah.
7787780	7792460	Yeah, so I just wanted to call and complain about that and just say how ridiculous it
7792460	7799660	is to charge $15 a month on top of wanting $60 for each of these song packs, which I'm
7799660	7803260	sure they're not anywhere near finished doing.
7803260	7809060	They're only up to, I think, maybe heroic verse songs in Infinitus.
7809060	7811180	So we're already past that mix.
7811180	7812180	So yeah.
7812180	7813180	Interesting.
7813180	7814180	Yeah.
7814180	7815180	And I've heard this before.
7815220	7819140	Isn't there a way as well, because I thought this was a thing that I remember going, the
7819140	7820140	fuck?
7820140	7825620	Like a way that you can play any song, basically like for a dollar, you get a four song game
7825620	7829660	just like you were playing an actual arcade machine, but that's on top of your $15 a month.
7829660	7830660	Is it?
7830660	7831660	That I haven't.
7831660	7832660	Or is that?
7832660	7833660	That I haven't seen.
7833660	7834660	Maybe that's in the DDR game.
7834660	7835980	It might be in the DDR game.
7835980	7841420	But what I do know about Infinitus besides these song packs is they do have unlockables,
7841420	7846180	but apparently they're incredibly grindy to get just like even basic difficulties for
7846180	7848420	each of these older songs.
7848420	7856300	And they sell boosters to boost how many unlockable points you get for like 12 hours.
7856300	7862240	And Orange Right and YYR are both confirming DDR Grand Prix does do that, but not 2DX.
7862240	7864620	So that's why my brain was getting crossed.
7864620	7865620	Yeah.
7865620	7866620	Okay.
7866980	7871700	But I think it's just it's such a bummer because this is an amazing way to be able to play
7871700	7876620	like some cool stuff at home, but they have to go and Konami it.
7876620	7878780	And it's just such a bummer.
7878780	7881040	They have to go and Konami it.
7881040	7883500	That is quite the phrase.
7883500	7887700	Do you think that maybe that's why they haven't really pushed this in the US?
7887700	7892820	You know, it's this is not something that we really see marketed in the US like at all.
7892820	7897560	This is really something that's do you think maybe the Japan culture is just more willing
7897560	7901900	to pony up the money for this or just, you know, maybe the way the games are piecemealed
7901900	7904740	over there with online services, they're willing to do it.
7904740	7909120	Whereas, you know, they know that if this was a bigger deal in the US, this stuff would
7909120	7911620	probably get called out.
7911620	7912620	Maybe so.
7912620	7918300	And I think it's also weird that I believe out of the three online PC titles, the DDR
7918300	7923340	Sound Vultex and 2DX, it's the only one that does not actually grant you any benefits in
7923340	7927340	the arcade if you link your or you have to link an EME's account.
7927340	7930980	But I think Sound Vultex and DDR actually give you some sort of benefit, whereas this
7930980	7936500	is like, give us a lot of money and a lot of your time to grind stuff.
7936500	7937500	But that's it.
7937500	7938500	We just want that.
7938500	7939900	Don't worry about the arcade.
7939900	7944300	I think there's just so many of us out there that just wish Konami would be bought by somebody
7944300	7947240	who could better handle all the intellectual properties.
7947240	7950800	But then at the same token, it's like Konami's not going to be for sale as long as they're
7950800	7954280	making oodles and oodles off slot machines and pachinko and all that stuff, which still
7954280	7956280	is doing very well.
7956280	7958280	And now they're online services.
7958280	7965320	Let's see, and YYR points out DDR gives you nothing in the arcade at present.
7965320	7967880	So it's not just something unique to 3DX.
7967880	7968880	Sound Vultex.
7968880	7969880	Okay.
7969880	7970880	Yeah.
7970880	7974400	But I'm still going to go all in or not all in on this, but I mean, I got my controller
7974400	7975400	coming at some point.
7975560	7981480	So you're like, all right, maybe I'll do 60 bucks this month, 60 bucks in a couple months
7981480	7985120	and build my collection slowly.
7985120	7990720	I'll just grind out the unlocked points and get Lionski and then just play that.
7990720	7992800	And that's all I need, I guess.
7992800	7997760	Just play, play the, because that's the sign of a true Bomani addict is that there's the
7997760	8004000	one song that you had to import a Japanese PlayStation 2 and copy of BeatMania 2DX and
8004000	8005000	2DX controller.
8005000	8006320	So you could play the one song.
8006320	8007320	Yeah.
8007320	8008320	Yeah.
8008320	8012120	Last time I was at the arcade, I played, I only get two songs per game and they were
8012120	8013120	both Lionski.
8013120	8017840	I was like, I got to let the entire arcade know how good Carlos is.
8017840	8018840	So.
8018840	8022320	Well, it is arguably one of the best songs in the, in the entire series.
8022320	8023560	Oh, definitely.
8023560	8030200	And I guess Infinitus has, it's not a Kiriyamaoka, but they do have a sequel to Lionski with
8030200	8032160	a puppet and everything.
8032160	8035520	It's right next to the original of the Safari.
8035520	8037960	Oh, the Safari is so good.
8037960	8040720	The original of the Safari, not the sped up one.
8040720	8041720	Yeah.
8041720	8042840	No, no, I don't count that one.
8042840	8045160	I don't even, I didn't even remember it until you said that.
8045160	8051920	So I'm sorry for bringing that little unfortunate piece back to light.
8051920	8052920	That's okay.
8052920	8054080	I'll forget about it when I take my Ambien.
8054080	8056200	So it's all good.
8056200	8061620	Well, Shane consider your complaint officially lodged, but as it is a complaint about Konami,
8061620	8064220	it has been classified as redundant.
8064220	8065220	So there you go.
8065220	8066220	Yeah.
8066220	8067220	Yeah.
8067220	8071780	I'm like, I'm not going to get any like email back saying like, thanks for your comment.
8071780	8073580	Here's a $2 coupon or something.
8073580	8074900	Shane, you used to work there.
8074900	8079140	You know how they work and it's worse than when you work there.
8079140	8080140	I know.
8080140	8084080	How is it worse than getting drunk at lunch and coming back to work?
8084080	8085080	I don't understand.
8085080	8087980	I don't know how many of those stories you should be telling on this program.
8087980	8088980	Whatever.
8088980	8090980	It only happened like twice.
8091340	8092840	All right.
8092840	8095780	On that note, we're going to let you go.
8095780	8096780	Thanks for the call, Shane.
8096780	8097780	I appreciate you.
8097780	8098780	No problem.
8098780	8099780	Bye.
8099780	8100780	Bye.
8100780	8101780	Even when you call to complain.
8101780	8102780	All right.
8102780	8104980	At least this one wasn't about me.
8104980	8111780	I think with that, we are going to probably start to wrap up the show here for the night.
8111780	8115540	Thank you guys so much for checking out our show tonight.
8115540	8116540	Thank you for being here.
8116540	8119780	Again, I encourage emails and things of that sort.
8120780	8122780	You can tweet us as well.
8122780	8126780	I do respond to tweets, even though I don't always remember to read them here on the show.
8129780	8131380	Thanks again for downloading our show.
8131380	8134180	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange, or watching us live.
8134180	8137580	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.
8137580	8140880	Tell a friend because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more
8140880	8145180	voices here with us on Sunday nights and throughout the week on Twitter and email and all the
8145180	8149020	other ways the podcasters, folks interact with us.
8149020	8152660	We need more folks to really get more voices here at the table and tell us about some of
8152660	8158780	these cool things we might not otherwise cross our desks because we're too busy playing other
8158780	8159780	games.
8159780	8164740	Also, as I mentioned at the top of the show, Spotify just unleashed reviews, so a nice
8164740	8169140	five-star review on Spotify goes a long way, so please consider that.
8169140	8170140	You don't use Spotify?
8170140	8175180	Well, a nice review or a social media share of whatever you are using does go an awful
8175180	8178820	long way, so please consider that as well.
8178820	8179820	Thanks again.
8179820	8186100	The Discord, if you want to join us for conversation throughout the week, vognetwork.com slash
8186100	8189740	Discord, if you want to join the Discord server.
8189740	8191100	So there you go.
8191100	8194740	I think the time has come to go around and give everybody's final thoughts and wrap it
8194740	8195780	up.
8195780	8202400	I hope everybody has a great holiday and we'll see you again in 2022.
8202400	8204740	It's going to be our 20th year of broadcasting.
8204740	8209460	This show started in June of, I almost said 1992, but that would actually be 30 years
8209460	8214220	if that was the case, and I think we would have all been in like high school-ish.
8214220	8217260	So we will see you.
8217260	8219180	We started in 2002.
8219180	8223260	We'll see you for our 20th broadcast year 2022 next week.
8223260	8225700	Until then, let's get some final thoughts.
8225700	8227500	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
8227500	8231540	Once again, you're muted.
8231540	8237540	Uh, I don't have any.
8237540	8238540	I want my soup.
8238540	8242540	I want to kill people and burn off my upsetness.
8242540	8248660	All right, well, I'm going to just smack survivors around and feel better about the universe
8248660	8250500	and my place in it.
8250500	8254340	I'm going to run no ed on every build and see how much salt I get.
8254340	8259120	All right, Dark Soccer will be doing that live for those folks on Twitch in just a moment
8259120	8260420	once we wrap it all up here.
8260420	8263020	So have a good killing spree, Dark Soccer.
8263020	8264020	Later tater.
8264020	8265020	All right.
8265020	8266180	Loki, we'll go to you.
8266180	8267180	Your final thought tonight?
8267180	8271100	My final thought is I got to put together my episode for this week.
8271100	8276400	I've been doing too much, but I think I've done enough now where I can kind of coast
8276400	8278620	on the next couple episodes after this.
8278620	8281860	All right, well, best of luck with all of that.
8281860	8283080	Yep.
8283080	8287860	My final thought is I hope to see you guys on Wednesday for the Final Fantasy XIV spoiler
8287860	8288860	stream.
8288860	8291420	But I understand you might not want to have everything spoiled yet.
8291420	8295300	So if you decide to wait and watch it later, hey, that is fine too.
8295300	8299500	We will have it in the VOG network archives for our subscribers to be able to access whenever
8299500	8300740	they want.
8300740	8303300	Otherwise, that's it.
8303300	8306300	I hope, again, you all have a safe New Year celebration, whatever you do.
8306300	8309940	And if you're doing something small at home, or if you're doing like a party with friends
8309940	8313700	that are all like boosted and masked up and all that stuff, then I hope everything goes
8313700	8315680	very well for you guys.
8315680	8316680	That's really it.
8316680	8317680	Happy gaming, everybody.
8317680	8319520	We'll be back next week.
8319520	8321440	We'll probably do some talk about games of the year.
8321440	8324240	I don't know if I have three games of the year for the list.
8324240	8325240	We'll see.
8325240	8328680	We'll talk about that next week and how we want to do all that and maybe some predictions
8328680	8331200	for 2022 because I think we skipped them this year.
8331200	8335660	We'll blame the pandemic for that and my aloofness, but we'll do some predictions for 2022.
8335660	8336660	So stay tuned next week.
8336660	8337660	We'll see you guys then.
8337660	8338660	Good night.
