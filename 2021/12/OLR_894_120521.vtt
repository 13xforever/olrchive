WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.560
It's another week and another Groundswell launch with rampant service issues.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.840
But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe mashups,

00:17.840 --> 00:21.960
ongoing social sagas, new release drive, remasters and re-releases, and a couple of glitches.

00:21.960 --> 00:26.040
It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums, and video games, the things

00:26.040 --> 00:28.880
we hold near and dear to our hearts.

00:28.880 --> 00:32.240
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details

00:32.240 --> 00:36.240
of all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.240 --> 00:47.000
Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.600
We are live once again with our first show for the month of December, if you can believe

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
it.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.960
It's December the 5th of 2021.

00:58.960 --> 01:05.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my friends as I have been for the last, oh gosh,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.320
almost 20 years now.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.480
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
Hello.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.920
Hi Jamie, how are you?

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
I'm doing.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.920
Yeah?

01:13.920 --> 01:14.920
You're doing?

01:14.920 --> 01:17.400
Still withdrawal is a bitch.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
Yeah.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
I hear you.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
I hear you.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.840
I have a friend visiting in the background on camera.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
Do you?

01:24.080 --> 01:27.480
I did some changes to the studio computer.

01:27.480 --> 01:32.080
My preview is very small, so it's hard for me to see you guys totally, but I see a little

01:32.080 --> 01:34.200
lump on the chair.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Yeah.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.920
Blending in with the black cushions.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.920
I gotcha.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Well, hello, Minda.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
Good to see Minda.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.480
You can see her eyes.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.560
We love a cat cameo.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.520
We always do.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.560
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Hello.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.560
Hi, Loki.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
How are you?

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
I'm doing good.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.680
Live on Twitch, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

01:55.680 --> 02:00.080
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, live

02:00.080 --> 02:03.480
on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.600
That's VOG network.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.920
And as we are broadcasting live, there's a video playing behind Loki as there usually

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
is.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
What is this?

02:10.920 --> 02:12.840
It is Minecraft, I'm seeing, right?

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
Yeah.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.880
It's the last episode that I put out.

02:15.880 --> 02:20.560
So I ended my season on Collusion MC.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.000
So yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.640
Well, congratulations on your first season and getting canceled, but new and better things

02:28.640 --> 02:29.640
in store, right?

02:29.640 --> 02:32.680
Well, it's not getting canceled.

02:32.680 --> 02:39.320
They just started their second season, actually, and I've been playing on it since I'm waiting

02:39.320 --> 02:45.520
for the NerdCraft server to start because they're waiting for some server RAM.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.520
Gotcha.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Un-canceled.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
Saved by Netflix.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
All right.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.880
And I noticed in chat, S2100 Matt is commenting on your beard.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.080
Loki's beard is coming in thick.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.080
I'm impressed.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.080
Are you trying to grow out your beard?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.080
No.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.080
No.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
It's lazy.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
I understand.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
I understand.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.000
For what it's worth, it's quite fetching.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.320
Thank you.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.200
It's also probably the flannel too.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.640
I've been kind of on a flannel kick lately.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.720
The whole Lumberjack chic.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.040
It is the weather here in Northern California for a Lumberjack dress.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.560
I don't blame you.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
I don't blame you.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.720
I was in my onesie until about five minutes ago, and then I realized I get really warm

03:21.720 --> 03:23.000
under these lights.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.120
I love playing video games in my little office in my Snuggie.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.760
Yes, I still rock the Snuggie blanket.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.080
Do they even still run those commercials on TV?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
Here I am chilling a product.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.600
There's a different thing now.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
Is it?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.600
Well, I still-

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
It's like a cloak thing.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
Yeah, that's right.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.720
There's like a demon cloak that they sell now, but I still rock that blue Snuggie that

03:44.720 --> 03:48.640
they sent me, or that I bought, that a friend sent me.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.200
This blanket that I'm wearing was free.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
Nice.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.760
And it is older than Julian.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
Aw.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
I love that.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.760
And it's warm.

03:56.760 --> 03:57.760
Oh my God.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.760
How old is that kid now?

03:58.760 --> 03:59.760
I think he's got to be like 16, 17.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.760
13.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.760
Oh, I thought older than that.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
No, he's going to be 14 in April.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.760
Oh, wow.

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Still.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
Still.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.760
My gosh.

04:06.760 --> 04:13.240
And of course, that's Dark Soccer's BFF, yeah, her kid, and who's been on the show before,

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
but it was a while ago.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.040
I understand we have probably some new listeners since several years ago when Julian came on

04:18.040 --> 04:21.040
the show to talk about, I think, Minecraft and Puzzle Pirates and the types of games

04:21.040 --> 04:22.520
he was into at the time.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.520
So yeah.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.160
He was doing Pirates 101.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
That's it.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
I'm sorry.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.160
It was Pirates 101, not Puzzle Pirates.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
I get them confused.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
My bad.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.360
All right.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.680
Let's jump into some gaming news.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.720
That's what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio for the next few hours.

04:38.720 --> 04:43.800
And yeah, the news is picking back up this week after the holiday Thanksgiving week that

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
we had last week.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.880
The news is starting to pick up as people are returning to work for the rush before

04:50.880 --> 04:54.600
the end of December and a lot of breaks that people take towards there in the new year

04:54.600 --> 04:56.240
and all that good stuff.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.360
So the news is picking up again.

04:58.360 --> 05:02.640
And we start tonight with a story about a game I play an awful lot of.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.400
So I'm going to get into my gaming week a little bit early, but I'm sure many of you

05:06.400 --> 05:10.740
out there, even if you don't play this game, you've been reading about this and you probably

05:10.740 --> 05:14.460
thought, you know, Rob might have something to say about all this tonight and you would

05:14.460 --> 05:15.460
be correct.

05:15.460 --> 05:20.860
And this has to do with the launch of Final Fantasy 14's latest expansion, Endwalker.

05:20.860 --> 05:21.860
So here's the deal.

05:21.860 --> 05:27.320
Technically, Endwalker launched in early access on Friday, which means if you had a digital

05:27.320 --> 05:32.060
preorder code or I think any type of preorder code, if you actually got one, I heard some

05:32.060 --> 05:33.980
stores are having problems delivering on that.

05:33.980 --> 05:38.420
But if you got a preorder code, you got to get into the game on Friday, even though the

05:38.420 --> 05:42.100
expansion doesn't actually launch until Tuesday.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.860
The reality of that is, though, that that is the launch day.

05:45.860 --> 05:46.860
Like let's be real.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.220
You know, Final Fantasy 14, it's been growing.

05:49.220 --> 05:50.280
It's bigger than ever.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.060
It's got a lot of more fans.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.180
And yeah, and they've been hyping up this expansion.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.300
And who doesn't want to play the brand new expansion when it comes out?

05:58.300 --> 06:00.060
So Friday was the launch day.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.700
Like Samantha, everything else is just semantics.

06:02.700 --> 06:07.820
And I think part of that has been to hide issues like what's been happening this weekend

06:07.820 --> 06:08.820
in the past.

06:08.820 --> 06:14.140
For example, a lot of folks in the community joke about Raobahn EX with the Stormblood

06:14.140 --> 06:15.140
launch.

06:15.140 --> 06:18.740
And that was a problem that happened when they launched the expansion two expansions

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740
ago.

06:19.740 --> 06:23.340
Stormblood was that there was a character, Raobahn, and you had to talk to him to start

06:23.340 --> 06:24.340
a solo mission.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.700
Well, the problem was so many people were hounding him.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.540
In a nutshell, he was having a problem cuing everybody for the solo instance.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.780
He started rejecting people and you couldn't proceed past this point.

06:34.780 --> 06:41.140
And it was pretty early on in the story and it got really frustrating for a lot of people.

06:41.140 --> 06:45.740
But what happened is that that ended up being, oh, well, that was part of early access, early

06:45.740 --> 06:46.740
launch.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.700
And by Tuesday, when the real launch happened, they were able to patch that and fix that

06:50.700 --> 06:51.780
and all that good stuff.

06:51.780 --> 06:56.060
So most of the time they've been able to kind of hide behind, well, all the problems were

06:56.060 --> 07:01.460
during early access and that's kind of what it feels like it ends up being.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.700
Here's something very interesting that happened this year.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.940
And I think we talked about it last week, or at least I remember tweeting about it.

07:06.940 --> 07:09.440
It might've been something that came out early this week.

07:09.440 --> 07:16.020
The producer behind Final Fantasy XIV, Naoki Yoshida, and his team came out and said, and

07:16.020 --> 07:19.060
I'm going to paraphrase here the way I interpreted it.

07:19.060 --> 07:23.460
And they said, there are going to be server problems when this game launches.

07:23.460 --> 07:28.220
We have tried everything we can to try to mitigate this, but you are probably going

07:28.220 --> 07:33.220
to have problems and you're probably going to have to wait in a queue to play the game.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.500
And, well, he was right.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.300
A lot of that has been being hit.

07:39.300 --> 07:45.780
He also said, because a lot of people wondered if they knew this game was bigger than ever

07:45.780 --> 07:49.480
and they knew they had so many pre-orders that were sold, why didn't they try to buy

07:49.480 --> 07:53.780
more equipment, even if temporary, to boost the servers?

07:53.780 --> 07:57.840
And here's the fascinating thing about this scenario, they did.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.540
Naoki Yoshida said, we tried.

08:00.580 --> 08:06.180
We can't get the parts because of the semiconductor shortages.

08:06.180 --> 08:13.280
So, in other words, they could not expand the server space to accommodate this expansion

08:13.280 --> 08:16.140
because of crypto and NFT.

08:18.380 --> 08:21.580
Although he didn't actually phrase it that way, but I'm going to go ahead and phrase

08:21.580 --> 08:25.560
it that way because that is a big part of what's causing the semiconductor shortage.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.220
But it still was a fascinating situation.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.980
We've been following games a long time.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.820
We've been playing a lot of MMOs.

08:33.820 --> 08:36.280
We collectively have played a lot of MMOs.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.100
I don't just mean World of Warcraft.

08:39.100 --> 08:44.740
I mean Final Fantasy XI, Ragnarok Online, hell, I remember touching Ultima Online for

08:44.740 --> 08:48.740
a hot minute and there's a lot of other things collectively we've tried.

08:48.740 --> 08:53.200
I don't know about you guys, I can't ever think of a time where the developers actually

08:53.200 --> 09:00.960
came out and warned, this may be a problem and we tried to mitigate it and we couldn't.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.200
So this is uncharted territory.

09:03.200 --> 09:10.360
Well, sure enough, the game launched on Friday, everybody wanted to get in, and there's queue

09:10.360 --> 09:12.320
problems out the wazoo.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.440
And here's the thing, the queue system, you know, you've seen a lot of screenshots on

09:16.440 --> 09:21.400
social media from your friends that play Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sure, with these LOLWTF queue

09:21.400 --> 09:22.400
times.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.920
5,000 people in queue, 10,000 people in queue, and just like a ton of people waiting to get

09:25.920 --> 09:27.160
in the game.

09:27.160 --> 09:32.240
And I think I can speak for most of the fans, there's always going to be the extreme opinions,

09:32.240 --> 09:38.800
I think I can speak for most of the fans and say, the 5 and 10,000 person queue actually

09:38.800 --> 09:45.780
really isn't the problem, yes, it's unfortunate, yes, it's a long wait, but you warned us,

09:45.780 --> 09:47.780
and that's not the problem.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.320
Here's the problem.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.140
People are getting kicked out of that queue.

09:52.140 --> 09:55.540
And an unexpected error will happen after a little bit of time, you're going to get

09:55.540 --> 09:59.440
an error that says 2002, a lobby error.

09:59.440 --> 10:04.160
And when people see that, and then they click OK, and they go and they get frustrated, whatever,

10:04.160 --> 10:08.200
eventually they try to get back in, and oh, they're back at the end of the line, please

10:08.200 --> 10:12.680
wait 5,000 people to get back in the, and of course people are not signing out.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.280
So yikes.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.940
So people get very frustrated because like, I don't mind waiting in line, it's when I

10:18.960 --> 10:21.220
get kicked out of line that I get pissed off.

10:21.220 --> 10:25.860
Now, you may or may not know this, Final Fantasy XIV people, they're challenged with this right

10:25.860 --> 10:32.640
now, 2002 specifically apparently has a workaround, and I've done this myself, I did it 5 times

10:32.640 --> 10:37.580
last night, I got kicked out of queue 5 times in a 4,000 person queue last night, and this

10:37.580 --> 10:39.540
worked every single time.

10:39.540 --> 10:43.480
You have to keep an eye on it, because if you're able to click OK, log back in the game,

10:43.480 --> 10:48.800
even if the game kind of errors you out like 3 or 4 times, keep trying to force your way

10:48.800 --> 10:49.800
in.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.200
If you can get back in that queue in like 5 minutes, you will not lose your place.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.080
If it's a 2002 error.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.340
And I don't think a lot of people know that.

10:56.340 --> 10:59.640
I think they give up, they get frustrated, and they go do something else, which I totally

10:59.640 --> 11:00.640
get.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.480
Here's the other problem, and again I speak from this from experience.

11:03.480 --> 11:08.320
There are other errors besides 2002.

11:08.320 --> 11:13.060
Last night, I tried to sign into the game at a later hour, about 930 Pacific, I figured

11:13.060 --> 11:16.560
it's after midnight Eastern, people were going to start going to bed, so I started to sign

11:16.560 --> 11:18.760
into the game at 930 Pacific.

11:18.760 --> 11:24.840
Suddenly at 11 o'clock, I'm down to one person in queue, which I think is a fake message,

11:24.840 --> 11:27.040
but it says one person in queue.

11:27.040 --> 11:32.400
And then error 4004, I get kicked out of the game.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.960
And I go, all right, well, I'll just do what I usually do, log right back in.

11:35.960 --> 11:41.320
I log back in, please wait 3,950 people.

11:41.320 --> 11:47.360
And that was the point when I said, all right, I am not doing this again until I hear the

11:47.360 --> 11:48.760
queue problems are resolved.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.400
Yes, I want to play the game.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.100
Yes, I'm frustrated, I'm seeing people all over social media tweeting about the story

11:54.100 --> 11:55.840
and how great it is.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.640
I was able to play quite a bit on Friday, so I'll be thankful for that, I guess.

12:00.640 --> 12:05.120
I got through the 81 dungeon in that part of the game, but it is very clear that is

12:05.120 --> 12:08.440
all I'm going to get until they work some of these issues out.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.440
So how are they going to work it out?

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
What are they going to do?

12:10.640 --> 12:17.200
Well, now Kiyoshita did post an update today about everything that's going on.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.480
And in the update, there was a lot that he actually went over, sorry, I'm trying to bring

12:21.480 --> 12:23.240
up the story here.

12:23.240 --> 12:28.080
Okay, so he actually apologized for the congestion.

12:28.080 --> 12:33.280
And this was one thing that really struck me actually is that in the statement, he says

12:33.280 --> 12:36.540
a few times he says, I'm sorry.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.700
He doesn't say we're sorry.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.980
He doesn't say sorry, you are having a problem.

12:41.980 --> 12:44.300
He says, I'm sorry.

12:44.300 --> 12:48.540
I want to point that out, highlight it, underline it, because this is why Naoki Yoshida, despite

12:48.540 --> 12:54.080
all these issues, is really respected by the Final Fantasy 14 game player base.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.660
Gaming executives take note, that is accountability.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.700
I'm sorry.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.420
Not we're sorry, or sorry, you are having a problem.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.420
I'm sorry.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.020
I think there's a lot of executives that can learn from that.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.200
And certainly there's something about the culture, you know, and so forth and why a

13:11.200 --> 13:15.620
Japanese based company is probably treating this a little differently than I think if

13:15.620 --> 13:18.940
certain other companies were having this problem.

13:18.940 --> 13:23.740
He does go on to say that all players are going to be awarded with seven days free gaming

13:23.740 --> 13:24.740
time.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.980
So basically, you're going to get seven days of time for free because of these issues,

13:27.980 --> 13:33.180
which is, I mean, what else literally can they do?

13:33.180 --> 13:36.260
This is the weirdest situation.

13:36.260 --> 13:39.600
The game is too popular for its own good.

13:39.600 --> 13:47.040
It is literally too popular and they cannot expand because of supply shortages.

13:47.040 --> 13:51.980
So literally, and he did say in the statement, seven days for now.

13:51.980 --> 13:56.500
But if this keeps continuing, paraphrasing, if this keeps continuing, we're going to look

13:56.500 --> 13:58.440
at doing more.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.600
So I mean, I appreciate that, you know, as a Final Fantasy 14 player who is frustrated

14:02.600 --> 14:05.140
with the lost time on Saturday, I do appreciate that.

14:05.140 --> 14:10.100
I'm not sure what the fuck else they can do at this point.

14:10.100 --> 14:15.380
So people are talking about, well, those of us that have been 3,000 subscribed for 3,000

14:15.380 --> 14:18.600
days, we should get priority and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

14:18.600 --> 14:23.080
Please allow me to say this as somebody who has been playing Final Fantasy 14 since 1.0

14:23.080 --> 14:30.700
and the alpha for A Realm Reborn, shut the fuck up and stop gatekeeping this game.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.860
You're being an entitled bitch right now and you need to stop it.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.040
So that is not going to fly.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.020
There needs to be a fair solution that works for everybody.

14:40.020 --> 14:45.380
And really what the solution is, they just, they need to figure out why is 2002, why is

14:45.380 --> 14:50.500
4004, why are these issues kicking people out of line when they're in line?

14:50.500 --> 14:55.240
Naoki Yoshida in the statement does continue to try to like explain what the networking

14:55.240 --> 14:56.240
problems are.

14:56.240 --> 15:02.020
He says there could be problems if you're on Wi-Fi versus wired and basically pledges

15:02.020 --> 15:05.580
that they're going to work on those types of issues.

15:05.580 --> 15:12.580
But outside of that, I honestly don't know what happens besides those that are able to

15:12.580 --> 15:17.360
wake up at four in the morning and start signing in when nobody else is signing in and get

15:17.360 --> 15:20.340
in the game and have burned through all the content.

15:20.340 --> 15:25.340
Those people are going to get bored because they're going to hit the top and nobody else

15:25.340 --> 15:26.340
is there.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.340
It's an MMO.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.960
There's nothing else to do.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.700
And I think those people will get bored and hopefully stop logging in and then eventually

15:33.700 --> 15:37.080
people can catch up and hopefully things will find its rhythm again.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.320
I think they need to delay the release of the raid content.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.560
And I know that is not a popular answer and people are going to hate me for that, especially

15:44.560 --> 15:49.720
end game content raiders, but the rest of us need an opportunity to get there.

15:49.720 --> 15:54.540
And I think they need to cut back on the fever to get to the end as fast as possible.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.840
They need to delay the launch of the raid content.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.600
And I know, again, that will not be a popular decision.

15:59.640 --> 16:04.280
I kind of don't care because, again, I think people need to stop gatekeeping Final Fantasy

16:04.280 --> 16:10.380
14 and the raiders can wait two more fucking weeks because, quite honestly, there's a part

16:10.380 --> 16:14.800
of me that really feels this game should have been delayed further.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.780
And I know that would have frustrated me as a fan, but I really think they should have

16:18.780 --> 16:22.820
looked to delaying it to earlier next year when they could have gotten some of the semiconductor

16:22.820 --> 16:24.160
parts and all that good stuff.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.820
And again, as a fan, that would have been super frustrating.

16:26.820 --> 16:32.300
But in retrospect, I kind of wish they just would have delayed it to early next year.

16:32.300 --> 16:39.260
However, I also understand investors, money, fiscal year, this is Square's cash cow right

16:39.260 --> 16:40.260
now, blah, blah, blah.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.540
That probably was never a plan that was going to fly.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.680
Two weeks was probably bad enough.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.740
So I get that.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.740
I'm going to chat for some comments.

16:48.740 --> 16:55.460
VXJ6V, sorry, Jason, our voiceover guy, VXJ6V says, Big enough is never enough.

16:55.460 --> 17:01.100
These issues at scale, Final Fantasy XIV, wow, et cetera, will never be fixed.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.620
True.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.580
Questbuster in chat says, hearing that kind of perspective from the developers is frankly

17:06.580 --> 17:07.580
refreshing.

17:07.580 --> 17:08.580
Yikes.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.860
And then Mike Deft goes on to say, Yoshi P is a godsend.

17:10.860 --> 17:13.060
Fifth Dream says Yoshi P, best game director.

17:13.060 --> 17:18.180
Like I said, Final Fantasy XVI, no pressure at all, right?

17:18.180 --> 17:19.180
Anyway.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.940
I have one more hot take on this.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.020
You guys want to hear this?

17:22.020 --> 17:27.180
Because I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you who is to blame for these issues.

17:27.180 --> 17:31.860
And I'm going to name one specific individual who is to blame for these issues.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.180
And it's not Yoshi P. It's not who you think.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.740
You guys want to hear my take?

17:35.740 --> 17:36.740
Sure.

17:36.740 --> 17:37.740
Thanks.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.740
Thanks for the reassurance.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.740
Here it is.

17:40.740 --> 17:45.700
Here is who to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch problems.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.540
Bobby Kotick.

17:48.540 --> 17:53.300
Bobby Kotick is the person to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch issues.

17:53.300 --> 17:57.580
Some of you probably are already starting to connect the dots on why I'm saying this.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.620
Please allow me to explain.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.060
Final Fantasy XIV is more popular than it's ever been before.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.260
Why?

18:05.260 --> 18:09.180
World of Warcraft, unfortunately, has been starting to tank.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.540
People are turning away from the game.

18:10.540 --> 18:14.380
And I know I have friends that are still very loyal to that game, but I think they're loyal

18:14.380 --> 18:17.180
to their communities, not the game.

18:17.180 --> 18:22.620
And you're starting to see communities in massive numbers start to go over to Final

18:22.620 --> 18:24.100
Fantasy XIV.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.420
In fact, you know there's been a lot of streamers that have done it.

18:27.420 --> 18:31.900
I know a lot of the media says, Asmongold, Asmongold, sure, there was him and he has

18:31.900 --> 18:33.800
a lot of influence online.

18:33.800 --> 18:38.660
For every Asmongold, there's plenty of other smaller streamers and their communities that

18:38.660 --> 18:40.700
are going over to Final Fantasy XIV.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.620
Again, I don't intend to gatekeep Final Fantasy XIV.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.740
I welcome all of those people.

18:45.740 --> 18:50.500
But it is the cause for why the popularity has gone through the roof and why we see these

18:50.500 --> 18:55.860
reports that more people were playing Final Fantasy XIV on Steam this last weekend than

18:55.860 --> 18:57.520
ever have before.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.100
And Steam is just one place to play the game.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.640
You can play without Steam.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.800
You can play on a Mac.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.300
You can play on a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.580
So this game is clearly more popular than it's ever been before because people are leaving

19:10.580 --> 19:12.180
World of Warcraft.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.180
Why are people leaving World of Warcraft?

19:14.180 --> 19:17.580
When did people start leaving World of Warcraft?

19:17.580 --> 19:21.420
When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?

19:21.420 --> 19:23.760
Can you all think of a point in time?

19:23.760 --> 19:25.700
When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?

19:25.700 --> 19:28.620
Dark Soccer, when did it start getting bad?

19:28.620 --> 19:31.820
Right after whatever came after Legion.

19:31.820 --> 19:37.700
And that would have been right around the time that Activision purchased Blizzard.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.700
What else?

19:38.700 --> 19:41.740
Not Burning Legion, not Burning Crusade, but like Legion.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.140
Yeah.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.300
Um, and those would have been pro- that was a little bit after, but you could say that

19:46.300 --> 19:51.640
those are the expansions that started under Activision's watch, uh, most likely.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.240
And what else happened with the Activision takeover?

19:54.240 --> 20:00.380
These horrible things that we're hearing about on the side with the sexual harassment and

20:00.380 --> 20:02.980
the threats to kill people and all this disgusting shit.

20:02.980 --> 20:07.300
I really don't want to rehash tonight, but please refer to earlier episodes or literally

20:07.300 --> 20:11.140
anywhere else on the internet right now about what is going on with all that.

20:11.140 --> 20:16.380
But all of that behavior ended up driving out the talent at Blizzard.

20:16.380 --> 20:21.300
I mean, one of the few really successful things Blizzard has been able to launch under Activision's

20:21.300 --> 20:23.400
watch was Overwatch.

20:23.400 --> 20:28.000
What happened to the creative director of Overwatch recently?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
He left.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
He left.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.020
Why did he leave?

20:32.020 --> 20:33.780
He was sick of Activision's bullshit.

20:33.780 --> 20:38.100
I'm very much reading between the lines, but if you read the report from the staffs and

20:38.100 --> 20:43.620
everything like that, that man, Jeff Kaplan, would often protect his teams from the bullshit

20:43.620 --> 20:46.800
Activision corporate overlords.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.740
So Blizzard started going downhill, WoW started going downhill when Activision started taking

20:51.740 --> 20:52.740
over.

20:52.740 --> 20:57.460
And what is preventing Blizzard from- why are people continuing to leave Blizzard?

20:57.460 --> 21:01.800
You just saw in the news, one of the big tweet folks this week who was instrumental in putting

21:01.800 --> 21:05.340
together a better ABK and all this stuff, she's leaving Blizzard.

21:05.340 --> 21:06.720
Why is she leaving Blizzard?

21:06.720 --> 21:11.640
Because Bobby Kotick still refuses to resign.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.580
So hopefully now the dotted line path is clear.

21:14.580 --> 21:19.520
The person responsible for your Final Fantasy XIV issues this weekend are crypto miners,

21:19.520 --> 21:23.880
NFT folks, and Bobby Kotick.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.000
That's it.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.440
I also want to remind everybody Bobby Kotick should have resigned probably years ago, but

21:30.440 --> 21:33.880
those issues that just came up in the Washington Post are about three weeks old now, and he

21:33.880 --> 21:35.880
still has not resigned.

21:35.880 --> 21:40.140
And yep, I'm going to bring this up a lot until he does, because we need to keep the

21:40.140 --> 21:43.200
pressure up on him and the board.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.400
And we have a story coming up a little later, you know, little Rob Roberts in his spare

21:48.400 --> 21:54.360
room on his dinky little podcast probably doesn't matter, but some folks that matter

21:54.360 --> 21:58.220
are starting to put the pressure on, and we'll get to that later in the show.

21:58.220 --> 22:02.220
But it's, yeah, it's very interesting.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.220
Going to chat.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.940
SJ100Matt says it all comes back to Voldecotek.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.500
Yeah, what?

22:07.500 --> 22:11.940
I mean, I know some of you guys are going to think I'm like being dramatic or whatever,

22:11.940 --> 22:13.580
and you know, whatever.

22:13.580 --> 22:14.920
But think about it.

22:14.920 --> 22:22.740
Why would Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft all come out and talk about their concerns about Activision?

22:22.740 --> 22:28.580
Because all of this affects them too.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.240
Questbuster in chat says, I remember when ATVI said years ago they would stop reporting

22:32.240 --> 22:36.740
subscriber numbers for World of Warcraft in their quarterly fiscal reports.

22:36.740 --> 22:40.840
Everything I'm hearing, and this is hearsay, I have no facts to back it up, so take it

22:40.840 --> 22:46.540
as that, is that the game is in worse state subscriber numbers than it's ever been, and

22:46.540 --> 22:50.220
it is classic keeping it afloat right now.

22:50.220 --> 22:54.660
But again, that could be just social media hysteria, I have nothing to back that up.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.380
But it all comes back to Voldecotek.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.380
Garbage.

22:57.380 --> 22:58.380
Yep.

22:58.380 --> 23:03.920
So anyway, I don't know what else to say about the login issues.

23:03.920 --> 23:11.400
You know, as a Final Fantasy XIV player, sure, I'm frustrated, but we were warned about it.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.500
And I kind of like, I see it for what it is.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.420
Like Yoshi P is doing the best damn job he can.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.340
Like he tried to get the parts.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.180
He can't get the parts.

23:21.180 --> 23:22.180
Like what?

23:22.180 --> 23:24.300
I feel bad for him.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.820
I don't know what else he can do.

23:27.820 --> 23:31.060
But I think they need to push back the raid content and they just need to slow the timetable

23:31.060 --> 23:35.100
down so that everybody has a nice chance to consume the content.

23:35.100 --> 23:40.740
And the reality is, the power users and the people that are already level 90, I mean I'm

23:40.740 --> 23:44.840
sorry folks, maybe you're on a low pop server or something like that, but the focus needs

23:44.840 --> 23:50.380
to be taken off that group and give them, purposefully, less things to do so they stop

23:50.380 --> 23:51.380
logging in.

23:51.380 --> 23:54.020
And it's not going to be a popular resolution.

23:54.020 --> 23:58.340
I think it's the only resolution at this point.

23:58.340 --> 23:59.340
For now.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.340
But we'll see.

24:00.340 --> 24:04.340
Maybe in a week they fix some of these other issues, and maybe during the work week less

24:04.340 --> 24:08.860
people are deciding to take off work to play a video game expansion and stuff.

24:08.860 --> 24:10.780
Look I've done it before too, I get it.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.540
And maybe the numbers will help thin out a little bit, but we'll see.

24:13.540 --> 24:14.540
We'll see.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.620
So anyway, those are the issues going on with Final Fantasy XIV's launch.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.900
Otherwise I'm going to say this, I know we're getting into our gaming weeks, I'm getting

24:19.900 --> 24:20.900
a little ahead of myself.

24:20.900 --> 24:26.660
I will say this, Friday night, when I was able to play and get past the level 81 dungeon,

24:26.660 --> 24:31.940
and I'm not going to spoil or say anything about the story, I'm just going to say, there's

24:31.940 --> 24:34.980
a lot of things done really well in this expansion.

24:34.980 --> 24:41.420
I'm really hooked into the story already, and a lot of the Final Fantasy IV references

24:41.420 --> 24:44.660
are so good.

24:44.660 --> 24:50.580
Right up to the level 81 dungeon has a ton of them, and I was giddy doing that dungeon

24:50.580 --> 24:51.580
for the first time.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.660
I am having some sound tearing issues, and some technical problems I didn't even get

24:55.660 --> 24:58.100
into yet.

24:58.100 --> 25:02.020
I don't know if that has to do with the launch or what, but I'm not going to bore you all

25:02.020 --> 25:03.460
with my technical problems.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.300
I was able to power through it, and I really loved what I experienced so far.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.420
And yeah, I'm bummed I can't be the first through the story like everyone else wants

25:11.420 --> 25:13.820
to be, but it is what it is.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.340
Anyway, let's get to everybody else's gaming weeks.

25:16.340 --> 25:20.080
I do have other stuff I can talk about later, but traditionally we start with Dark Sakura,

25:20.080 --> 25:22.800
so Jamie, how was your gaming week?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.760
It was lots of Dead by Daylight.

25:25.760 --> 25:30.600
If you log in every day, it's sort of, I like how Bourbon said it, it was like a sort of

25:30.600 --> 25:32.880
an advent calendar sort of thing.

25:32.880 --> 25:38.320
You log in every day, you get blood points or iridescent shards or different things in

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
game.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.320
So definitely you're playing Dead by Daylight.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.420
Oh, a lot of mobile phone games do that incentive thing.

25:42.420 --> 25:44.040
Daily login bonus.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.280
But this is not a mobile game.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.200
Well, I mean, there's a mobile version, but this is the-

25:48.240 --> 25:50.120
I know, but it's the same concept.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.120
Yeah.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.480
And there's also a couple of blood point codes floating around.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.480
One is Ho Ho Ho.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.480
What'd you call it?

25:56.480 --> 26:01.480
Girl, you know you a ho, OK?

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
Anyway.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.000
And so I've been doing that.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.400
I've also been playing a lot.

26:07.400 --> 26:12.040
I'm calling it a game for right now, but just because I got it on Steam, but I'm playing

26:12.040 --> 26:16.840
in Vroid Studio trying to work on an avatar.

26:16.880 --> 26:20.760
Not that I think I'm going to be a VTuber or anything, but who knows, it'll be good

26:20.760 --> 26:24.720
for those days where I don't feel like doing makeup.

26:24.720 --> 26:35.440
And then I've been playing my wordscapes and we have ACDC pinball back in the house now.

26:35.440 --> 26:41.440
And Dance Buddy Will has been over, so there's been a lot of pinball going on in my house.

26:41.440 --> 26:45.080
And I picked up another game on Steam today.

26:45.080 --> 26:50.360
There's a sale going on for the same company that does No Man's Sky.

26:50.360 --> 26:54.680
Oh, I know the game because I played a little bit of it.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.680
Go ahead.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
What game?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.680
The campfire game.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.680
No.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.920
Oh, I thought you said it was, OK, go ahead.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.840
It's the same company, but I didn't get that game.

27:04.840 --> 27:12.340
I got one, gosh, it's called Chime Sharp.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.380
It's like a music Tetris-y, puzzle-y game and it looks pretty interesting.

27:16.380 --> 27:19.260
Hmm, I'll have to look that up.

27:19.260 --> 27:24.200
I hate the art style in it, so I'm never going to buy it, but I love the little avatar they

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
have for it.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.980
It's Kitty Powers matchmaker.

27:26.980 --> 27:31.780
It just makes me think that that's like a drag queen trying to hook people up.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.020
I think it's adorable.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.740
Kitty Powers love life.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.980
Just the Kitty Powers character is really, really hilarious looking.

27:38.980 --> 27:41.260
Actually, I think that is a drag queen.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.260
But anyway.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.260
Yeah.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.140
She was at the first GamerX, if I remember right.

27:45.140 --> 27:52.220
Yeah, but I was looking at, I wanted to play some of those escape room games, but they're

27:52.220 --> 27:56.220
not Mac and I'm still waiting on my VHS key.

27:56.220 --> 28:00.180
Oh yeah, that game looks cool.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.180
Yeah.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.700
I've been watching Dro play it a lot.

28:02.700 --> 28:06.100
It's been really, it looks really interesting.

28:06.100 --> 28:13.980
I still think I might like Dead by Daylight still better, but I also, speaking of Dead

28:13.980 --> 28:20.020
by Daylight, when I go on my medical leave, I will be televising my mental breakdown live

28:20.020 --> 28:22.140
on the internet.

28:22.140 --> 28:26.340
So there we go.

28:26.340 --> 28:27.340
I look forward to it.

28:27.340 --> 28:34.220
I know I was going to say Jamie, I mean, but I can appreciate that you are doing something

28:34.220 --> 28:39.620
that you have done for a while as like that routine thing to kind of keep you grounded

28:39.620 --> 28:40.620
through the process.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.260
I think, I think is the nicer way I'd put it.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.260
Yeah.

28:44.260 --> 28:48.260
And actually Dark Tetsuya is mentioning that Dead by Daylight is free on the Epic Games

28:48.260 --> 28:49.260
Store.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.260
It's free until the ninth.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.260
Yes.

28:51.260 --> 28:55.860
And we have been seeing a lot of baby killers and baby survivors as a result, and I'm looking

28:55.860 --> 28:57.860
forward to killing them all.

28:57.860 --> 29:03.940
And just a public service announcement because I know it is very

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
well-intentioned.

29:04.940 --> 29:08.300
I appreciate people want to make sure we're in the loop on that.

29:08.300 --> 29:14.180
I have been told more times than I can count on my hands that DVD is free on the Epic Store

29:14.180 --> 29:16.020
and we did bring it up on last week's show.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.020
So many fucking people.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.020
Thank you though.

29:18.020 --> 29:21.640
I appreciate people think of us and so forth, but I just want to be clear.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.640
We know.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.640
Thank you.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.820
I just took the opportunity to remind people that it's going to be free until the ninth.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.300
Let me flip it in a positive way.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.100
And we want you to get it before the ninth.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
Don't tell us to get it.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.180
We know you get it before the ninth.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.600
That's the positive spin I'm going to put on it.

29:39.600 --> 29:47.380
But at any rate, if you do start playing during this period, don't be discouraged.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.560
You will die many, many times, survivors.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.860
You will die.

29:52.860 --> 29:57.340
And if you are a killer, be prepared to get lots and lots of teabagging throwing your

29:57.340 --> 29:58.340
way.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.620
It's going to happen.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.740
You are not going to win your first match.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.900
Darth Tetsuya in chat says, y'all sucked me in.

30:04.900 --> 30:05.900
Congratulations.

30:05.900 --> 30:06.900
There you go.

30:06.900 --> 30:07.900
Let's put in.

30:07.900 --> 30:08.900
Let's put a notch on the wall.

30:08.900 --> 30:09.900
There you go.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.900
One down.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.860
SSG100 Matt, I think is trolling.

30:13.860 --> 30:16.700
Oh, you can get it free on the Epic Game Store.

30:16.700 --> 30:17.700
Yes.

30:17.700 --> 30:23.140
But as a reminder, also on Game Pass for you Xbox slash Windows Game Store affectionados.

30:23.140 --> 30:24.140
So.

30:24.140 --> 30:26.860
And none of y'all can get the Demogorgon and it'll be your loss.

30:26.860 --> 30:27.860
Yeah.

30:27.860 --> 30:28.860
That's okay.

30:28.860 --> 30:29.860
There's better killers.

30:29.860 --> 30:30.860
All right.

30:30.860 --> 30:34.580
Everybody is adorable, but do you know what this means, Rob?

30:34.580 --> 30:35.580
You know what this means?

30:35.580 --> 30:36.580
Huh?

30:36.580 --> 30:37.580
No more toxic chips.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.580
Ahoy, Steve.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.580
Oh.

30:39.580 --> 30:40.580
Or whatever.

30:40.580 --> 30:42.820
Oh, there's plenty that already bought this.

30:42.820 --> 30:46.260
There's plenty of them already there, but there won't be any more added to it.

30:46.260 --> 30:47.260
All right.

30:47.260 --> 30:48.260
Scoops Ahoy.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.260
Or Broccoli Nancy.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.260
It's it's.

30:50.260 --> 30:53.020
What was his, what was his like Ahoy hat?

30:53.020 --> 30:54.020
It's Scoops Ahoy.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.020
Scoops Ahoy.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.020
Scoops Ahoy.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.020
That was it.

30:57.020 --> 31:00.460
Well, no more Scoops Ahoy, Toxic Steve and no more Broccoli Nancy.

31:00.460 --> 31:03.860
I will say, and this is the last I'm going to say on this because we do need to move

31:03.860 --> 31:05.660
on from a topic besides Dead by Daylight.

31:05.660 --> 31:10.420
But um, and, and, and, and my husband, Alan said that, or maybe you had said this, Jamie,

31:10.420 --> 31:13.460
I'm confusing you with my husband and that's starting to worry me, Dark Soccer, but we

31:13.460 --> 31:15.420
spend that much time together.

31:15.420 --> 31:19.840
Um, one of you said this and that maybe I think you both did, and that is that they

31:19.840 --> 31:24.720
have that skin for Jonathan in the game that is a replacement for Steve and that's cool,

31:24.720 --> 31:30.220
but they really missed an opportunity before they pulled the rights to have an alternate

31:30.220 --> 31:35.740
for Nancy, who is the other Scoops Ahoy girl that was in season three.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.740
That is.

31:36.740 --> 31:37.740
I didn't say that.

31:37.740 --> 31:38.740
Okay.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.740
Then it was Alan.

31:39.740 --> 31:40.740
Who's Uma Thurman.

31:40.740 --> 31:41.740
I wanted Barb.

31:41.740 --> 31:42.740
Who's Barb, but Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke's daughter.

31:42.740 --> 31:46.140
I don't remember her name, but she's, she plays that.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.380
She would have been a great addition.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.940
I loved her character.

31:49.940 --> 31:54.700
So anyway, no, we just have extra Nancy.

31:54.700 --> 31:55.700
Yes.

31:55.700 --> 31:56.700
All right.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.700
Anything else for your gaming week?

31:59.180 --> 32:00.180
No.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.180
Okay.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.180
Then we'll go to Loki.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.180
Loki.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.180
How was your gaming week?

32:04.180 --> 32:11.580
It was video editing and Minecraft, so, uh, it was finishing up season one, which we have

32:11.580 --> 32:14.740
the last episode playing behind me, um, on video.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.740
You're watching the video.

32:16.740 --> 32:21.980
And so basically I was finishing up the last episode of season one of collusion because

32:21.980 --> 32:27.060
they are resetting their, well, they have reset their server as of Friday and I've actually

32:27.060 --> 32:28.060
been playing on that.

32:28.500 --> 32:32.100
The plan is, I'm not sure if I'm going to be making content on here.

32:32.100 --> 32:36.500
I may make a few videos on here, but primarily I'm going to be on nerd craft season two,

32:36.500 --> 32:38.180
whenever that launches.

32:38.180 --> 32:43.280
So the way I've been kind of playing it is the collusion stuff's going to be more just

32:43.280 --> 32:49.920
like kind of low key, um, not really going to like stress on making like large builds

32:49.920 --> 32:50.920
and stuff like that.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.320
Just more kind of having fun and just playing regular Minecraft.

32:54.320 --> 33:01.040
Like today, for example, I built a community farm for, um, a blaze spawner, so blaze farm

33:01.040 --> 33:04.740
for the community to use because they had one set up on the server last season.

33:04.740 --> 33:07.760
So I figured, you know, I'll pitch in, in that kind of sense.

33:07.760 --> 33:12.460
And then the other thing I want to do is like, um, if you take a boat on ice, they go really

33:12.460 --> 33:13.460
fast.

33:13.460 --> 33:17.400
And so you can make like a drift course with those and around the place where I've set

33:17.400 --> 33:22.020
up my base, um, just tons of huge ice reversed.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.820
So I may make a course through that.

33:23.820 --> 33:28.680
So that kind of stuff kind of contributing to the server, but once, you know, the nerd

33:28.680 --> 33:32.900
craft stuff launches, I mean, playing primarily on there, but I'll come back and visit the

33:32.900 --> 33:34.260
server as much as I can.

33:34.260 --> 33:39.020
Cause it was kind of hard cause you know, I was torn leaving the server in the first

33:39.020 --> 33:43.380
place because there was really no one playing for the last like four months, which is like

33:43.380 --> 33:44.900
half of the season.

33:44.900 --> 33:45.900
And so it was tough.

33:45.900 --> 33:49.300
Like if I want to grow my channel, I can't really do that when I'm not interacting with

33:49.300 --> 33:50.620
anybody.

33:50.620 --> 33:54.820
I kind of felt bad cause they understood why and they're very cool about it.

33:54.820 --> 33:59.420
And you know, they're insistent, like, listen, we know that you're not going to play on here,

33:59.420 --> 34:00.420
we'll keep you white listed.

34:00.420 --> 34:01.940
You can come visit as much as you want.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.420
And I was like, okay, well fine.

34:03.420 --> 34:07.580
I'll, I'll, I'll play as much as I can and like support, you know, as much as I can.

34:07.580 --> 34:12.700
And I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, definitely, um, kicking right now we've got, you know,

34:12.700 --> 34:15.940
there's probably like eight players playing at all times.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.820
Plus they have voice chat now, which is cool.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.820
The proximity chat.

34:18.820 --> 34:19.820
Oh, cool.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.500
So it's been, it's been kind of fun.

34:21.500 --> 34:25.460
So running into different people and they're trying to build a little bit closer together.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.820
And so they're just kind of getting that server stuff off the ground.

34:27.820 --> 34:32.540
We finally come back and visit, but yeah, once we get into the new season, um, with

34:32.540 --> 34:36.540
a nerd craft and stuff, it's just going to be some massive builds and everything like

34:36.540 --> 34:37.540
before.

34:37.540 --> 34:40.700
So, but yeah, just been playing Minecraft.

34:40.700 --> 34:41.700
Awesome.

34:41.700 --> 34:46.740
It sounds like you've, uh, had a lot of, uh, good, good times and good memories being made

34:46.740 --> 34:47.740
there.

34:47.740 --> 34:49.260
I need to, I need to dabble back in Minecraft.

34:49.700 --> 34:50.700
It keeps up.

34:50.700 --> 34:51.700
One 18 is amazing.

34:51.700 --> 34:52.700
Yeah.

34:52.700 --> 34:58.380
You need to play one 18 because it's just, you know, it's all sorts of craziness.

34:58.380 --> 35:03.060
My schedule and gaming suddenly freed up with my inability to play Final Fantasy 14.

35:03.060 --> 35:06.180
And I finished that no man's sky expedition to transition to my gaming week.

35:06.180 --> 35:08.940
I finished the no man's sky expedition, the redo.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.460
So I got my golden Starship.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.740
So did Alan, by the way.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.100
So applause for us both.

35:13.100 --> 35:16.100
Um, but the no man's sky, I did two and three.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.400
I don't need to do those again.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
So I have nothing to do.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.400
No man's sky till the end of the month.

35:20.400 --> 35:24.720
And then Alan and I might start a multiplayer thing, uh, and maybe stream a little bit of

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
it, but we'll see.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.920
But anyway, I might do Minecraft just to scratch the itch of the crafting stuff.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.800
Cause you know, there's a lot of that in no man's sky is like a lot of Minecraft really

35:33.800 --> 35:38.840
check out one 18, just like pop in a server and just check it out because like the caves

35:38.840 --> 35:44.000
and everything are completely different before there's like very like, it's just really big

35:44.000 --> 35:47.840
vistas and like, everything's kind of like, wow, it's like for the first time type stuff,

35:47.840 --> 35:51.680
you know, they kind of get that, you know, first time playing Minecraft feeling again.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.240
That's pretty fun.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.160
I'm getting into other stuff for my gaming week.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.160
I'm Marissa.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.160
My cell is in chat.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.160
Hi.

35:58.160 --> 36:02.080
Saying my gaming week was sending Rob all my Pikmin bloom postcards because no one else

36:02.080 --> 36:03.080
I know plays.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.880
I have been seeing them, Marissa.

36:04.880 --> 36:05.880
Hello.

36:05.880 --> 36:06.880
Thank you for being here.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.880
And uh, thank you for that.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.880
I appreciate.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.720
I wish I could send you as many back, but because my friend, you know, the Niantic friends

36:12.720 --> 36:13.920
list cross pop it.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.760
So if you add somebody in Pokemon go, they're automatically in Pikmin and, uh, with, uh,

36:18.760 --> 36:22.360
you know, well, you don't have friends in Ingress, but they, they go back and forth.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.840
So I actually have quite a few friends that are addicted to Niantic games like myself

36:26.840 --> 36:28.520
because I met them playing Ingress.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.200
So, um, I have quite a few people I have to set postcards to, but I always try to make

36:32.200 --> 36:35.520
sure I send Marissa at least one or two cute ones from my week.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.120
So, um, hope you've been enjoying those.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.160
I will say I have continued to play a lot of Pikmin bloom, um, with everything I've

36:41.160 --> 36:45.000
talked about in my own personal life over the last month, we're trying to be more active

36:45.000 --> 36:49.360
and when I'm eating and all that stuff, I I've been doing pretty good on my walking.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.000
Um, and Pikmin bloom has been a huge motivator for that.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.840
I got to say, I hit level 29 today after a little, a little hike around.

36:56.840 --> 37:02.320
I did a three mile walk today, uh, around one of the parks here and, uh, my Pikmin hit

37:02.320 --> 37:03.320
level 29.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.320
So that was pretty cool.

37:04.320 --> 37:10.680
So, um, Oh, Marissa says I play on private property, so I'm probably encouraging trespassing.

37:10.680 --> 37:15.320
How did you get a thing on your private property that you're not supposed to have that?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.320
Just so you know.

37:16.320 --> 37:22.160
So lucky you, um, let's see, I want to come visit now cause there's probably a portal

37:22.160 --> 37:23.160
in there.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.160
That's really hard to get.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.240
Uh, anyway, um, so, uh, what else for my gaming week?

37:28.240 --> 37:30.440
So honestly, no man's sky.

37:30.440 --> 37:34.840
We talked about the final fantasy 14 Pikmin, honestly, guys, that really just leaves a

37:34.840 --> 37:36.680
little bit of debt by daylight.

37:36.680 --> 37:41.320
And, uh, I've just been trying to level up, uh, Jonah, cause I really wanted his ability,

37:41.320 --> 37:46.480
the new, the new survivor, because I really wanted his ability, um, to, for, for my other

37:46.480 --> 37:47.480
characters.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.640
I got his level 30 ability, which is the one I wanted.

37:49.640 --> 37:55.720
And then I saw as much as wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you mean, uh, non bleach tips,

37:55.720 --> 37:56.720
Guy fairy?

37:56.720 --> 37:57.720
Yes.

37:57.720 --> 37:58.720
Yes.

37:58.720 --> 38:04.120
And as loud as he is, he's loud, but they get, well, a, I always run iron will anyway,

38:04.120 --> 38:08.440
but B they gave him a skin that he wears a flat cap.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.440
Like I do.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.760
And like a little polo shirt.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.560
I was like, Oh, I kind of love CIA guy.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
Yeah, I know.

38:14.560 --> 38:20.800
But, but I think it's good that we're having more, uh, of course Latino characters.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
Yes.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.600
And so freaking love Carmina.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
Oh yeah.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.720
Anyway, no, it's fine.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.640
I brought it up, but I, it was a part of my week and I did some slightly different things.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.160
So that's really it for my gaming week.

38:33.200 --> 38:37.200
Um, yeah, uh, try to, I'll try to do some more streaming next week.

38:37.200 --> 38:42.600
Uh, I I'm sorry, I never streamed Final Fantasy 14, but because of all the issues going on,

38:42.600 --> 38:44.080
I think you can understand why.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.440
And my sound tearing was pretty bad anyway.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.480
I don't think it would have made for a great stream.

38:48.480 --> 38:53.880
So there's that, uh, before we get into other news, Marissa, another comment in chat says

38:53.880 --> 38:58.280
Pikmin bloom for me is just a more engaging step counter.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.480
That's actually kind of what I like about it.

39:00.480 --> 39:06.680
Is that it, um, uh, it's a lot more simple than ingress or Pokemon go.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.100
It's a more set it and forget it kind of game.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.880
And I, that's actually kind of what I like about it.

39:10.880 --> 39:16.160
It makes it easier to multitask and play that game while you're doing other stuff, um, out

39:16.160 --> 39:17.160
around the world.

39:17.160 --> 39:21.520
Um, as to show 100 mountain chats has been playing forza horizon five when I can.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.520
Yeah.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.760
That's, that's what I need to do and go back and pick up those games.

39:24.760 --> 39:29.020
I've really dropped cold Turkey because they keep stacking on top of each other.

39:29.020 --> 39:33.260
Like all these game releases I want to play, I need to play more forza horizon five.

39:33.260 --> 39:37.180
I dropped, um, Pokemon, uh, brilliant diamond shining pro.

39:37.180 --> 39:38.860
I brought, I dropped diamond.

39:38.860 --> 39:43.180
Like I barely touched it since that first weekend I played it and I need to remedy that

39:43.180 --> 39:44.180
too.

39:44.180 --> 39:48.020
Although I'm kind of waiting for like the home connection to be in there.

39:48.020 --> 39:50.700
Cause then I can do the collection challenge and all that stuff.

39:50.700 --> 39:55.060
So yeah, I didn't play Pokemon shield until like a year after it was out.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.140
So I'll probably just be a little while before I go back and visit.

39:58.260 --> 40:02.260
All right, we're going to get into some more news, just so you know, for scheduling purposes.

40:02.260 --> 40:05.840
Uh, I know the holidays are coming up and a lot of shows are going to be off towards

40:05.840 --> 40:06.840
the end of the month.

40:06.840 --> 40:11.740
Um, honestly, the way the days fall this year in years past, there's been a show on the

40:11.740 --> 40:14.300
25th or on new year's eve or something.

40:14.300 --> 40:17.740
So we haven't really been able to do them, but the way things fall this year, we have

40:17.740 --> 40:23.260
a show on January 2nd and a show on December 26th.

40:23.260 --> 40:25.580
So we should be here for those shows.

40:26.100 --> 40:29.820
Dark soccer may be off on the 2nd of January, but Loki and I will hold down the fort if

40:29.820 --> 40:31.780
that's the case, uh, that night.

40:31.780 --> 40:35.980
So, uh, we, we will still be or given you content through the next few weeks.

40:35.980 --> 40:40.620
So please enjoy that much content I'm sure, but yeah, we'll, we'll see.

40:40.620 --> 40:45.340
We might have to, uh, figure out, maybe invite a guest or try to get some evergreen content

40:45.340 --> 40:46.340
somehow.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.340
We'll talk about that.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.340
That's for sure.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.840
Hopefully catch up on our gaming backlogs.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.420
So there shouldn't be any shows off for a little bit.

40:52.460 --> 40:56.820
There probably will be a week or two off early next year, uh, for some reasons that I'll

40:56.820 --> 41:02.420
get into in a future episode of the show, uh, for meantime, let's get into some gaming

41:02.420 --> 41:04.580
news and some of the other headlines.

41:04.580 --> 41:08.460
I guess I alluded to this one earlier, Loki, why don't you start off with this?

41:08.460 --> 41:16.020
Uh, yeah, so, um, basically it's more Activision drama.

41:16.020 --> 41:21.500
So Activision Blizzard King where the government officials are pressuring, um, the Activision

41:21.500 --> 41:26.300
Blizzard guys again, because of, you know, stuff not actually happening.

41:26.300 --> 41:32.320
And, um, basically now it's starting to affect the, or they're threatening their company's

41:32.320 --> 41:34.020
profits as well.

41:34.020 --> 41:38.860
So it's as we're concerned, the current CEO and board of directors don't have the skillset

41:38.860 --> 41:43.480
nor the conviction to Institute these sweeping changes needed to transform their culture

41:43.480 --> 41:48.300
to a source for us with the employees and the shareholders and the partners.

41:48.300 --> 41:55.340
Um, apparently they have formed a workplace responsibility committee, but you know, we,

41:55.340 --> 41:58.820
as we mentioned last week or the joke I made last week was yes, they formed the committee

41:58.820 --> 42:03.420
to investigate themselves and they'll find no wrongdoing whatsoever.

42:03.420 --> 42:09.180
Um, but basically they're trying to get the, uh, little public pressure as well, you know,

42:09.180 --> 42:13.260
kind of going to the shareholders to try to push pressure on them.

42:13.260 --> 42:18.260
And it, I think it has affected them a little bit monetarily, but I don't know if it's like

42:18.260 --> 42:23.700
I think it was just temporary, didn't really seem to be like a big, um, hit in their stock

42:23.700 --> 42:25.580
prices or anything like that.

42:25.580 --> 42:26.580
Right.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.900
Um, and then can I give a little more background here?

42:28.900 --> 42:33.820
Just because I want to make sure with the, which government officials are upset and why

42:33.820 --> 42:37.660
this is different from the criminal investigation happening in California.

42:37.660 --> 42:42.140
What you have here is you have a series of States, um, where the treasures of the States

42:42.140 --> 42:45.900
have basically come together to say, this is a problem at ABK.

42:45.900 --> 42:46.900
Why?

42:46.900 --> 42:52.740
Because you may or may not realize this, a lot of state money gets invested, um, in the

42:52.740 --> 42:54.780
stock market, just like some of your money.

42:54.780 --> 43:00.220
Um, because that is how a lot of States pay for like pension plans, uh, and pay for, um,

43:00.220 --> 43:02.140
a lot of different elements of the state.

43:02.140 --> 43:07.020
Uh, the money may be invested so that, you know, just like for why a private citizen

43:07.020 --> 43:09.780
would do it, you want to try to make more money.

43:09.780 --> 43:15.540
So the problem is because of these issues at ABK and the way the stock is going down,

43:15.540 --> 43:21.140
maybe it's not having a huge impact on investments now, but these treasures are speaking up because

43:21.140 --> 43:26.500
like whoa, whoa, this now this is starting to affect our money that goes into.

43:26.500 --> 43:35.620
So basically the most capably vocal state, uh, shareholders that could possibly speak

43:35.620 --> 43:38.820
up government officials are speaking up.

43:38.820 --> 43:40.020
That's the long and short of it.

43:40.020 --> 43:42.460
So I just, I just kind of want to explain that a little bit because I think it's easy

43:42.460 --> 43:45.220
to say, Oh, the government's mad at ABK again.

43:45.220 --> 43:48.500
But this is a little different because this isn't a criminal investigation.

43:48.500 --> 43:53.200
This is right now it's impacting your money, which is what, again, the CEO is supposed

43:53.200 --> 43:55.620
to be in charge of making sure it doesn't happen.

43:55.620 --> 43:56.620
So sorry, Loki.

43:56.620 --> 43:57.620
I just want to clarify.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.140
No, no, that makes sense.

43:59.140 --> 44:04.020
And yeah, I mean, maybe they're not necessarily great investment right now.

44:04.020 --> 44:09.340
Um, but don't worry, they're going to turn those stock prices right around with the technique

44:09.340 --> 44:13.260
that they've used in the past, which is, Hey, we're making lots of money, so let's lay off

44:13.260 --> 44:14.680
some more employees.

44:14.680 --> 44:21.160
So they've, uh, the QA testers for call of duty are now facing layoffs after being promised

44:21.160 --> 44:23.520
raises back division.

44:23.520 --> 44:30.520
So um, Raven software, uh, the contractors there were told that they would face layoffs

44:30.520 --> 44:33.400
starting January 28th of next year.

44:33.400 --> 44:37.580
Um, because apparently they are done QA testing the game.

44:37.580 --> 44:39.580
It's good enough, I guess.

44:39.580 --> 44:40.580
Right.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.360
Um, this is disgusting.

44:42.360 --> 44:48.500
Like, and you know, I, I'm sure there is a, you know, well, Rob, if you wanted to look

44:48.500 --> 44:52.520
at this realistically, these layoffs were probably starting to be planned three months

44:52.520 --> 44:55.800
ago before a lot of this started to come out and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

44:55.800 --> 45:02.700
I don't give a fuck because this last year, it's too late off like 800 people.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.440
It's disgusting.

45:04.440 --> 45:09.020
Like I understand people get laid off from businesses that are not profitable sometimes,

45:09.020 --> 45:12.380
but it's disgusting to watch the board take home the money that they do.

45:12.380 --> 45:16.860
I understand Bobby Kotick cut his salary on paper, but we all know he's still making money.

45:16.860 --> 45:20.700
It's disgusting that there's still profits going to the wrong places.

45:20.700 --> 45:24.780
And these people, it's that that's the frustrating part.

45:24.780 --> 45:29.620
You're watching these hardworking people, the people that most deserve money and don't

45:29.620 --> 45:33.700
deserve any of this shit that everybody's throwing at ABK right now.

45:33.700 --> 45:37.720
We were, we're trying to be that protective person, trying to dodge them from the arrows

45:37.720 --> 45:40.460
and the gunfire that are going around on the internet.

45:40.460 --> 45:44.920
These are the people we're trying to protect, the hard frontline workers and to see them

45:44.920 --> 45:50.280
get laid off when Bobby Kotick keeps his job and the board keeps his job, it is fucking

45:50.280 --> 45:51.920
frustrating.

45:51.920 --> 45:57.160
So frustrating, like beyond the capacity for words.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.240
Yeah, for sure.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.240
Anyway.

46:00.240 --> 46:06.920
Um, if that's all you have to say about that, I have another ABK related story, which this

46:06.920 --> 46:08.680
is all I have to say.

46:08.680 --> 46:13.140
This is all under that umbrella of we're still going to talk about the business and these

46:13.140 --> 46:16.160
news types of things here on the show.

46:16.160 --> 46:21.020
And this has to do with some of the fallout when it comes to the Game Awards.

46:21.020 --> 46:26.360
So a question came up this week about how my Activision Blizzard be involved at the

46:26.360 --> 46:28.480
2021 Game Awards.

46:28.480 --> 46:34.480
And I don't know, there was a Washington Post article where they kind of interviewed Jeff

46:34.480 --> 46:40.160
Keeley and this whole thing happened where, you know, there's, and then Kotaku kind of

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
did a hit piece.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.360
Like, I don't, I don't know what else to call it.

46:42.360 --> 46:49.220
They kind of did a hit piece where they were like, Jeff Keeley refuses to, uh, say that,

46:49.220 --> 46:53.440
you know, he's not going to have Activision Blizzard involved with the show and all this

46:53.440 --> 46:54.440
stuff.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.240
And again, I think Jeff has a difficult line to walk here.

46:57.240 --> 46:58.240
I really do.

46:58.240 --> 47:03.300
Because again, there is a part of the Game Awards where we want to acknowledge the developers

47:03.340 --> 47:08.780
and the people that work hard on the games, even when the antics of the publisher is what's

47:08.780 --> 47:10.060
driving us bonkers.

47:10.060 --> 47:12.060
And that's exactly what's happening here.

47:12.060 --> 47:15.260
It's Activision that we're pissed off at, Bobby Kotick and all this stuff.

47:15.260 --> 47:18.800
You know, the people that develop the games, that's not the people we're mad at.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.700
And so I can understand where Jeff is trying to shift the conversation there.

47:21.700 --> 47:25.400
Now, other people take issue with, well, look who's on the board.

47:25.400 --> 47:30.180
You have the president of Activision who's on the board, which a board of advisors for

47:30.180 --> 47:34.900
the Game Awards, which by the way, if y'all on social media before you click retweet would

47:34.900 --> 47:38.980
do a little fucking research, sorry, cause this, this does annoy me.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.980
It's not Bobby Kotick.

47:40.980 --> 47:43.620
It's Robert Kosich or something like that.

47:43.620 --> 47:47.860
It is a different individual who is the president of Activision.

47:47.860 --> 47:51.060
I may be ignorant and I will be the first to say it.

47:51.060 --> 47:56.700
I am not aware of this individual being connected to any of the sexual harassment bullshit and

47:56.700 --> 47:58.220
all this stuff that's going on.

47:58.260 --> 48:01.620
I, and I may just be unaware and I'm willing to own that.

48:01.620 --> 48:05.260
If this individual is tied to that, then it, it sucks and all that.

48:05.260 --> 48:08.400
And one could argue he is the president of Activision.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.060
The onus should be on him to that extent.

48:10.060 --> 48:12.100
I will agree with you on that.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.020
Then maybe for that reason, there is no place for him on the board.

48:15.020 --> 48:20.860
However, did you not fucking notice before you click that retweet button, Yves Gilman

48:20.860 --> 48:27.260
is also on the board from Ubisoft and don't we have quite a few same problems going on

48:27.260 --> 48:28.260
over there.

48:28.260 --> 48:29.260
Yep.

48:29.260 --> 48:33.660
It's a boys club is what it is.

48:33.660 --> 48:41.140
To Jeff's credit, I do notice there are several women and other folks that are in that panel.

48:41.140 --> 48:44.500
And it doesn't feel token to me, but I'm not on that board.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.400
It does feel like there are more than one.

48:46.400 --> 48:51.620
There are a few and so forth, but the most problematic of the guys are on it.

48:51.620 --> 48:52.620
Oh sure.

48:52.620 --> 48:53.620
Sure.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.740
I'm not, I'm not going to excuse that.

48:55.740 --> 49:00.440
And SJ 100 Matt is kind of piping in saying all Jeff said was that he is still navigating

49:00.440 --> 49:04.620
how to handle the issue and Kotaku spurred it into something different with its headline

49:04.620 --> 49:05.620
and article.

49:05.620 --> 49:09.660
And I agree that Kotaku really framed this in a negative way that a lot of people ran

49:09.660 --> 49:10.660
with.

49:10.660 --> 49:14.560
And I think, I don't think it was appropriate to be quite honest.

49:14.560 --> 49:22.500
But I do understand to a point the industry needs to say something and Jeff is kind of

49:22.500 --> 49:24.620
representing the industry this week.

49:24.620 --> 49:28.580
But I hope you all are very aware the industry is saying something.

49:28.580 --> 49:35.340
Did you not hear what Microsoft said, Nintendo said, Sony said, and now the governments of

49:35.340 --> 49:40.620
several states are saying in regards to their investment, the pressure is mounting on Bobby

49:40.620 --> 49:41.620
Kotick.

49:41.620 --> 49:42.620
It will crack.

49:42.620 --> 49:48.440
And if there's a miracle, we'll get one before the year's end, I hope, but we'll see.

49:48.440 --> 49:54.920
But I do think that piece was a bit inappropriate on Kotaku's part, quite honestly.

49:54.920 --> 49:58.880
There are elements of it I understand, and I even go so far as to agree with.

49:58.880 --> 50:04.960
I think basically saying to him, because you have not clearly said no Activision Blizzard

50:04.960 --> 50:10.820
at all in my show, you are endorsing all of this behavior, I think that was a shit position

50:10.820 --> 50:11.820
to put him in.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.180
I do.

50:13.180 --> 50:17.240
Because I think Jeff is in it for the folks on the front lines as well.

50:17.240 --> 50:20.860
And you see that in the types of stuff that he tries to acknowledge and sprinkles out

50:20.860 --> 50:23.880
throughout his show and all that stuff.

50:23.880 --> 50:29.480
Long story short, after that article came out, Jeff Keighley did write a series of tweets

50:29.480 --> 50:35.220
that said Activision Blizzard will not be involved with the show outside of their nominations

50:35.220 --> 50:36.720
and potential wins.

50:36.720 --> 50:41.060
So if they win something, they still get to go on stage and accept the award.

50:41.060 --> 50:49.180
But in my humble opinion, the gaming press, if Activision Blizzard should win an award,

50:49.180 --> 50:54.820
will not hesitate to comment about these problematic issues with Bobby Kotek in the same breath

50:54.820 --> 50:56.140
as the award.

50:56.140 --> 51:00.220
Which is unfortunate for the developers, but is probably what should happen.

51:00.220 --> 51:05.260
We need to be reminded that there are problems that still need fixing at Activision Blizzard.

51:05.260 --> 51:07.420
It should totally be a big call out.

51:07.420 --> 51:08.420
Absolutely.

51:08.420 --> 51:09.420
So.

51:09.660 --> 51:12.380
But I don't envy Jeff Keighley in this position.

51:12.380 --> 51:16.340
He's like, can't we just celebrate game developers and games and all this stuff?

51:16.340 --> 51:18.580
And you know, I kind of get it.

51:18.580 --> 51:22.320
S.J.O. and Hunter Matt in chat says, it wasn't a good look, but Jeff is listening and has

51:22.320 --> 51:23.420
a history of listening.

51:23.420 --> 51:26.660
His statement later that night was the best he could do in that situation.

51:26.660 --> 51:32.380
And Mike Deff says, I think the only two ABK games there are Call of Duty, and I'm pretty

51:32.380 --> 51:33.740
sure it won't win.

51:33.740 --> 51:35.180
I don't think it'll win either.

51:35.180 --> 51:36.380
I don't think it will either.

51:36.380 --> 51:38.180
So I don't think, I think this is all going to be for naught.

51:38.180 --> 51:40.140
It's all of the polish that they're putting in.

51:40.140 --> 51:41.140
Yeah.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.140
Yeah.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.780
Anyway, speaking of the game world, look, there is much more going on to the game awards

51:44.780 --> 51:46.820
than just this stuff.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.740
We're going to get some game reveals.

51:48.740 --> 51:49.800
Jeff has been teasing.

51:49.800 --> 51:52.320
There's one he's been working on for like two years.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.900
People are jumping to conclusions.

51:53.900 --> 51:57.660
It's a Breath of the Wild sequel reveal.

51:57.660 --> 52:03.120
I don't want to jump to that conclusion, but I understand why people are leaping there.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.780
And Jeff does have a history of working pretty well in Nintendo.

52:05.780 --> 52:09.620
So we might, we might see something pretty exciting there at the game awards.

52:09.620 --> 52:11.940
But regardless, we're going to see some exciting stuff there.

52:11.940 --> 52:14.380
It's pretty much winter E3 coming up this week.

52:14.380 --> 52:19.860
So I do want to say here at VOG Network, at least Bobby and myself and Jamie and Loki

52:19.860 --> 52:24.380
are welcome if they can make it certainly, we're going to be co-streaming the game awards

52:24.380 --> 52:27.520
Thursday night starting at 4.15 Pacific.

52:27.520 --> 52:32.100
It's going to be a long night because there's a pre-show at 4.30 Pacific, 7.30 Eastern.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.860
And then I think the awards themselves are at least two hours, maybe even three.

52:35.860 --> 52:37.360
So it's going to be a long night.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.860
Do we know how long the awards are Bobby?

52:38.860 --> 52:39.860
Are they three hours?

52:39.860 --> 52:41.620
I think it might be a long show.

52:41.620 --> 52:44.720
So we're going to be busy Thursday, but we will be co-streaming it here.

52:44.720 --> 52:48.620
So if you want to, and you know, we try to keep it positive and, and give our reactions

52:48.620 --> 52:50.980
and gasps to trailers and things like that.

52:50.980 --> 52:53.780
It'll be like watching it with friends in a pandemic safe way.

52:53.780 --> 52:58.900
So we'll be here to do that for you guys Thursday here at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

52:58.900 --> 52:59.900
Yeah.

52:59.900 --> 53:03.900
SJ 100 Matt says, I can see a few acceptance speeches be interesting.

53:03.900 --> 53:05.180
Me too.

53:05.180 --> 53:08.440
And I think that is going to be the interesting thing in all of this.

53:08.440 --> 53:13.380
It's going to be interesting to see a little bit of that Oscar political speech crossover

53:13.380 --> 53:14.380
to the game awards.

53:14.380 --> 53:17.940
They kind of, kind of, I don't even know if I would call it political, but just workers'

53:17.940 --> 53:18.940
rights.

53:18.940 --> 53:19.940
I think it kind of needs to.

53:19.940 --> 53:22.140
So it'd be very interesting to see what comes of that.

53:22.140 --> 53:23.940
So let's watch it together on Thursday.

53:23.940 --> 53:24.940
All right.

53:24.980 --> 53:28.660
Bobby says, wow, scheduled to go until eight o'clock Pacific.

53:28.660 --> 53:30.180
All right.

53:30.180 --> 53:33.560
That's longer than an episode of this show, but we'll do it three and a half hours on

53:33.560 --> 53:34.560
Thursday.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.560
Hope you'll join us.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.940
No Man's Sky trailers.

53:37.940 --> 53:38.940
Sign me up.

53:38.940 --> 53:40.500
I fucking love No Man's Sky.

53:40.500 --> 53:44.780
I fail to see the problem, Loki.

53:44.780 --> 53:48.800
Now if it's more Deathloop trailers, actually that game is pretty good from what I understand.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.980
So I need to, I need to stop harassing that.

53:50.980 --> 53:52.420
It may even win the game of the year.

53:52.420 --> 53:53.420
So we'll see.

53:53.420 --> 53:54.420
All right.

53:55.420 --> 53:56.420
Let's move on.

53:56.420 --> 54:00.540
We have more news going on and I think this one we're going to throw over to Jamie.

54:00.540 --> 54:08.020
So it looks like PlayStation, there's going to be some plans from Sony to hopefully take

54:08.020 --> 54:12.420
over what's going on with Xbox Game Pass, at least give them some solid competition

54:12.420 --> 54:13.740
for it.

54:13.740 --> 54:18.480
The code name for this service is called Spartacus and it's going to let PlayStation owners pay

54:18.480 --> 54:23.420
a monthly fee for access to a catalog of modern and classic games.

54:24.420 --> 54:29.160
They apparently were said by people who were not authorized to speak to the press.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.740
So we have some NDA breakage possibly.

54:32.740 --> 54:41.800
They said that it's going to be available on PS4 and PS5 and quite possibly in the next

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
few months.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.520
And they're also thinking about having a free monthly titles.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.880
This was actually stated by Bloomberg.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.260
So it's a pretty big service.

54:51.260 --> 54:55.460
So that's enough for me to give it some merit.

54:55.460 --> 54:56.460
Yeah.

54:56.460 --> 55:01.020
Jason, I forget his last name, Shear, I think it is with Bloomberg.

55:01.020 --> 55:02.780
Sorry if I mispronounced the last name.

55:02.780 --> 55:08.260
He's been on top of a lot of stuff lately with the ABK stuff, especially too.

55:08.260 --> 55:11.560
So his Twitter feed's been pretty fascinating follow lately.

55:11.560 --> 55:16.220
So I think when Bloomberg and he's stepping up to report this, I think this is one of

55:16.220 --> 55:19.020
those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things for sure.

55:19.020 --> 55:24.480
Not to say things can't change as I think happened with the Switch Pro.

55:24.480 --> 55:26.420
But I think it's definitely a smoke, there's fire.

55:26.420 --> 55:29.700
And of course, Sony has to compete with Game Pass, right?

55:29.700 --> 55:35.580
Like we kind of saw that whole like PlayStation 4, what is it, 20 games available on PS5 and

55:35.580 --> 55:36.580
all that.

55:36.580 --> 55:38.560
That was kind of like the first step in that.

55:38.560 --> 55:44.500
So I think this makes a lot of sense and marrying it to PlayStation Plus and making it all one

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
pro.

55:45.500 --> 55:49.340
PlayStation now I don't think is having the type of numbers Sony probably wants.

55:49.340 --> 55:53.820
I think trying to put that all in one package, even if it's multi-tiered, which is a little

55:53.820 --> 55:56.940
weird, but I guess it's working for Nintendo.

55:56.940 --> 55:59.380
I think it has the potential to work out.

55:59.380 --> 56:03.980
I think a lot of people just want to know, is it going to be all cloud gaming or do I

56:03.980 --> 56:07.300
actually get to download PS2 and PS1 games and play them?

56:07.300 --> 56:10.460
It'll be interesting to see how that works out because I think there's still a lot

56:10.460 --> 56:13.300
of resistance to cloud gaming because of bandwidth caps.

56:13.300 --> 56:15.620
And believe me, I understand.

56:15.620 --> 56:19.620
But with PS1 games, I bet it's probably not going to be as bad as you think.

56:19.620 --> 56:23.760
Because like Antstream, when I was playing that, you know, that's all cloud gaming.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.620
It was like nothing on my bandwidth.

56:25.620 --> 56:26.620
It really wasn't.

56:26.620 --> 56:27.620
It was probably as much bandwidth.

56:27.620 --> 56:30.620
I mean the games themselves aren't that big anyways, so yeah, I can imagine that'd

56:30.620 --> 56:31.620
be pretty decent.

56:31.620 --> 56:32.620
We'll see.

56:32.620 --> 56:34.300
But well, but can the hardware run them?

56:34.300 --> 56:39.940
I would be shocked if a PlayStation 5 can't run PS1 and PS2 games.

56:39.940 --> 56:43.620
PS3, I get, gets a little dicey, it's a little newer, it was different, you know, but...

56:43.620 --> 56:45.020
He's gonna do that now though.

56:45.020 --> 56:46.020
I know.

56:46.020 --> 56:47.020
I don't know.

56:47.020 --> 56:48.020
I know.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.020
I have a hard time believing that.

56:49.020 --> 56:53.580
SD100Matt in chat says, I hate the idea of a tiered system as a consumer.

56:53.580 --> 56:55.220
Just give me a flat rate with everything.

56:55.220 --> 57:00.120
I see that, but it'll be interesting to see what all they include.

57:00.120 --> 57:05.980
I think a point that the media has not been bringing up enough in regards to this story

57:05.980 --> 57:11.500
that I want to remind people of, Sony, and I've said this on the show before, and I think

57:11.500 --> 57:18.460
we've seen Sony do a little bit of this, Sony has arms and extensions of their company in

57:18.460 --> 57:22.620
other areas that could really sweeten this pot.

57:22.620 --> 57:26.380
You know, if they are gonna go to a three tiered program and that third tier has games

57:26.380 --> 57:33.660
and all that stuff too, why wouldn't that third tier have Crunchyroll, Sony movies,

57:33.660 --> 57:37.620
Sony music, and some of these other things as well?

57:37.620 --> 57:45.060
What if a high tiered pass was beyond just PlayStation and it was gaming and entertainment

57:45.060 --> 57:46.060
and whatever else too?

57:46.060 --> 57:47.060
I'm done with that.

57:47.060 --> 57:51.020
It's impossible to get any of the Sony movies on any streaming service aside from Voodoo

57:51.020 --> 57:53.100
and you have to rent that stuff, so no thanks.

57:53.100 --> 57:56.320
And that's why I think Sony should really be looking at that.

57:56.320 --> 58:02.700
If they're gonna talk a multi-tiered system, then go the, I guess the Apple all-in-one

58:02.740 --> 58:08.660
route where you can get Apple Fitness separately, you can get Apple TV separately and all that,

58:08.660 --> 58:11.180
but they also have that pass that has everything.

58:11.180 --> 58:12.180
That would be a smart route.

58:12.180 --> 58:15.540
I think that would be a smart model for Sony to copy, but that's just my opinion.

58:15.540 --> 58:16.540
We'll see what they do.

58:16.540 --> 58:17.540
So.

58:17.540 --> 58:20.700
Um, Dartasuya in chat says, oh, that's a good point, Rob.

58:20.700 --> 58:21.700
Thank you.

58:21.700 --> 58:23.680
I try my best on this program and please keep inflating my ego.

58:23.680 --> 58:26.220
It drives me to do this show more and more.

58:26.220 --> 58:27.220
Thank you for the reassurance.

58:27.220 --> 58:28.220
I appreciate that.

58:28.220 --> 58:29.220
All right.

58:29.740 --> 58:33.300
Watch my ego swell live on Twitch.

58:33.300 --> 58:38.180
I need to get a bigger hat and just keep switching hats throughout the show as Dartasuya and

58:38.180 --> 58:42.260
other kind chatters inflate my ego and I just switch into the bigger hats as the show goes

58:42.260 --> 58:43.260
on.

58:43.260 --> 58:44.260
All right.

58:44.260 --> 58:46.740
It'll look like the Kentucky Derby before we're done.

58:46.740 --> 58:47.740
All right.

58:47.740 --> 58:49.860
Moving on to our next story.

58:49.860 --> 58:50.860
Loki.

58:50.860 --> 58:51.860
It was kind of cool.

58:51.860 --> 58:55.620
They're doing this whole, uh, Winter Games Fest thing through Xbox.

58:55.620 --> 58:58.820
It's going to be a bunch of the independent developers at Xbox.

58:58.820 --> 59:02.780
Um, they're going to have like a bunch of game demos out.

59:02.780 --> 59:06.460
So they have a small list of the games that are out right now.

59:06.460 --> 59:09.860
Um, not a lot of these are recognized because they are independent games, but like Death

59:09.860 --> 59:15.480
Trash, Loot River, The Tale of Biston, Black Tail and Nobody Saves a World.

59:15.480 --> 59:20.300
And those are supposed to be available, um, from December 7th through the 21st.

59:20.300 --> 59:21.860
You can check out those demos.

59:21.860 --> 59:29.140
They're coming to the Xbox One series and, uh, I think also PC as well, but it's pretty

59:29.140 --> 59:35.020
cool to see some of these, um, kind of like almost like E3 style demos being put up at

59:35.020 --> 59:36.020
one time.

59:36.020 --> 59:37.020
I know they've done this in the past.

59:37.020 --> 59:38.020
It looks pretty cool.

59:38.020 --> 59:39.020
Yeah.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.020
I like that.

59:40.020 --> 59:41.020
We're kind of getting all this stuff in the winter time.

59:41.020 --> 59:44.180
Like, uh, you know, off cycle E3 type of thing.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.980
So yeah, I like that.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.980
Yeah.

59:47.980 --> 59:48.980
Uh, yeah.

59:48.980 --> 59:50.900
So I'm, I'm excited to check some of this stuff out.

59:50.940 --> 59:54.220
We know Xbox has their own cloud things set up too that I'm sure they can deliver some

59:54.220 --> 59:55.220
of this through.

59:55.220 --> 59:56.220
So it'd be interesting.

59:56.220 --> 59:57.220
Yeah.

59:57.220 --> 59:58.220
All right.

59:58.220 --> 01:00:04.020
Um, y'all know I play way too many AR games from Niantic, um, including Pokemon Go and

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020
Ingress.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.620
And I even tried that Harry Potter game for a hot minute, but it's going away anyway.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.380
But what could the future of Niantic look like besides, Oh, what Transformers and not

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.460
Catan, but whatever else they, what else have they announced that they haven't come out

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.460
with yet?

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.460
There was another one.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.220
I don't remember the moment.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.220
Transformers was one.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.220
Yeah.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.220
Maybe it was Pikmin.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.820
And I just, I'm looping that in cause there was three games.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.820
Yeah.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.820
I think it's Pikmin.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.220
I was like trying to think if there's another one on top of Pikmin, but I'm sure there's

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.220
more.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.300
Well, you've seen things like when they're advertising their own metaverse, right?

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:39.500
Cause now, and this is like it or not, this is going to become more and more of a conversation

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.080
in this decade because this is what everybody's kind of buying into, at least on the corporate

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.240
level is this metaverse type of thing, which metaverse going to be the new blockchain thing.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240
I hope not.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.960
You know, I don't know when Niantic talks about it, I get it.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.760
When Facebook talks about it, I'm guarded like that's, that's, that's, that's the reality

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.020
of the situation.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.600
But there's, there's been conversation about how other tech companies are kind of going

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
to this place too.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.820
But anyway, I don't want to just talk about meta, but I do want to talk about a very interesting

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.500
purchase that Niantic made, made this week.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:16.040
And that is a gameplay recording app called low key.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:24.240
Not to be confused with a co-host here on orange lounge radio, this is L O W K E Y.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:32.560
So low key, um, so low key, the, uh, app that Niantic bought, uh, low key was designed with

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.060
like casual games in mind or people that don't really want to sit there and edit their videos.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.680
What the app does, it captures videos on the computer and syncs them with the phone.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.360
And then on the phone, you can use very basic, simple editing tools to make short clips for

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.760
mobile viewing.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.860
That's actually kind, I never knew about this app, but that is, I can actually see the place

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.200
for that with people wanting to get on Instagram and TikTok and all like moving that from the

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.560
computer to get on TikTok actually makes a lot of sense to me.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.680
So it sounds like that's the type of thing that low key is trying to do.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.620
Um, so, um, Niantic has purchased low key.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.160
Now they didn't say what low key is going to be involved with, but the quote leadership

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:18.560
in the space will accelerate the social experiences Niantic is building in its products.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.760
We share a common vision for building community around shared experiences and enabling new

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.960
ways to connect and play for our explorers.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.260
Let me tell you a true story in the Niantic world for a minute.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:37.060
So one of my really good friends, uh, one of my favorite people in my life, uh, John,

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:42.160
my old roommate who may have cameoed on this show once or twice when we were at the house.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.300
Do y'all remember when we were on Justin TV, long time OLR people, and we were in that

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.600
garage that would get really cold in the winter, but it was insulated.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.900
It's not super cold.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.820
And we had like the Christmas lights and actually looked like a studio in there.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.340
That was the house I lived out with John.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.460
John got super into Pokemon Go.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.300
Um, and I kept nagging him to try Ingress and eventually he finally cried.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.140
Like there was a slow period in Pokemon Go and he played Ingress and he fell in love

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.140
with it and he really enjoyed it.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.380
And he's still playing it and he's actually even playing it today.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:20.860
And uh, he actually sent me a text today and he said, I hiked up Mount San Miguel just

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.780
to farm keys for a potential, I guess I shouldn't be giving strategy away, oops.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.820
But he did a big hike today for reasons, wink nudge.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.400
And he actually, and this is going to be very hard to see on the Twitch feed, but you can

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.840
all can see I've been sent a panoramic picture.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:41.040
He sent me a picture from the top of the mountain where this video game inspired him to go hike

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.580
and go exploring at.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.020
That's awesome.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.900
And then he sent me another picture if I can see it here, hold on, cause I'm going to try

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.180
to put this up onto it.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:56.160
Then he sent me a picture of his dirty pants that got covered in dirt from the walk.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.180
And I think my response was Ingress, Oh, the places you'll go and shoes you'll ruin in

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.500
the process.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.520
So, but anyway, this is my point.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.540
So I didn't just tell you all that to read a cute text message exchange about Niantic.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.640
The key part in there was he sent me a picture from the top of this mountain that he probably

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.680
wouldn't have gone to otherwise.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:23.260
And I bet you if John Henke, CEO of Niantic heard that story, he would smile and say,

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.500
yes, exactly.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.060
And I think that is what this is.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.980
This is going to be because if Niantic is building themselves out as like real world

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:38.540
exploration and they always push this stuff, like take pictures with your Pikmin interacting

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.540
in the real world.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.980
But then when community day and stuff rolls around, they like to highlight here's photos

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.900
of people gathering and playing and walking and being active and they love to push that

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900
stuff.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.180
I think they really want to take that to the next level with some of this like social sharing

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.180
stuff.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.960
And whether it's, they're going to build it into the apps to like make you able to do

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.240
TikTok videos more easily, or they want to build their own network or something.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.320
I'm not sure what's in the cards for that right now.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:15.560
But I think that is the direction and definitely Niantic's vision for all this stuff.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.400
Mere Muse in chat says, oh, the places you'll go and the mud you'll find.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.120
Yes, that is true.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.080
Mike Defton chat says, all according to plan.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.280
John Hanke, most look, most likely an accurate quote.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.980
Quest Buster in chat says Niantic jonesing for a piece of the metaverse pie.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.480
They've already said they are going.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.040
If you watch that whole thing about light ship, which we got into a couple of weeks

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.860
ago on the show, they said they're going for the metaverse.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:46.840
It's just Niantic's metaverse is AR.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.640
And I think most of Facebook, because I'm not calling him by the name they want me to

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.840
Facebook's universe, I think is mostly hinged in VR.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.320
But I think there are AR elements to it.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.060
I think Facebook kind of wants to do everything.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.200
But Niantic's made it very clear.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.520
And that's why I'm I'm kind of excited to see Niantic of all people competing with Facebook,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.320
because I know who I'm rooting for in that situation.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.780
S2100 Matt says, honestly, I'm shocked they haven't let folks buy clothes to customize

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.720
all of their Pokemon and go, oh, wait, just you wait.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.320
Zen Monkey 11 says the goal is probably world domination, like always in a way.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.060
I mean, businesses do exist to make money.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.480
That's the society we live in.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.120
But Pokemon Go is an example.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120
They're doing a pretty good job.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.320
I don't know how well Pikmin's doing, but I think it's doing all right.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.280
It seems to be high up in the download chart of, you know, I don't think the game has to

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.560
be the runaway success that Pokemon Go was to be successful, but we'll see.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.400
So anyway, we'll see what develops of this low key purchase.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:51.480
Every time I hear Niantic getting into social, I'm so curious what they're developing on

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.060
the back end, because I know they're starting to build this friends list and everything

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.320
is coming together in that regard.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.520
By the way, before I toss it over to Jamie and her story, I did want to give one tiny

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.000
update on Niantic's biggest game, Pokemon Go.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.120
If you were not already aware, they released a pretty major update on iOS.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.460
It didn't change anything about the game mechanics, but for a while now, Android has been running

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:19.580
at 60 frames a second and the iPhone version, for whatever reason, I don't know, hasn't

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.580
been.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:25.820
This new version, you can go into advanced settings and you can now unlock and run the

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.480
game at higher frame rates.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.220
It's probably at the cost of battery, but I get pretty good battery out of my, you know,

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220
iPhone.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.220
I don't even know what iPhone I have.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.220
I think it's an 11.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.360
I still get pretty good battery life out of that.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.200
And I got to say, the game looks really good.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.500
Like when you have the unlocked frame rate, it's so smooth.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500
It's butter.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.500
It's like butter.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:49.060
Um, and by the way, that feature is also on the Android version for not just 60 frames

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.740
a second, but unlocked.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.580
So you can do that if you want.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.820
So anyway, uh, I think it's really, I think it looks really good.

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:59.620
I don't know why it's in advanced settings, but again, my, my assumption is it's tied

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.900
to battery life.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.040
Um, so yeah, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I was going to ask how that new update

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.040
looked for you, Rob.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040
It looks good.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:12.460
Well, I mean, Alan has Android because we're, we're a bi-phonal household, uh, and, uh,

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.780
Alan is, so I've seen the, the Pokemon at 60 frames a second.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.700
I was, I was like, oh, that does look really good.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.540
I wonder why they won't do all right.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.240
It took them time, but they finally got it over.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.180
So hooray.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.020
And Mike Def says, yeah, I've heard of people having their battery drain a lot quicker.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.740
So yeah, I would, I would say play in short bursts or don't turn that feature on or, you

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.340
know, hook it up to a battery charger or whatever.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340
All right.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340
Sorry, Jamie.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.340
I just wanted to make sure that important update got out there.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.340
So what do you have for us?

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:48.740
So, um, there has been another leak, um, because leaks, leaks are going to leak, right?

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.900
Um, it's been linked, uh, linked, oh my gosh.

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900
I can make words happen.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900
I promise.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:09:03.260
Um, Bioshock force setting and it's time period, um, actually it was shared by a journalist

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:10.260
named Colin Moriarty, um, who was saying that was going to take place in the 1960s in an

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.780
Antarctic city.

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:18.020
And um, it also has matched what other sources have said.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.940
So it could be very, very accurate.

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.260
It's supposed to be in a city called Borealis.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:31.740
Um, the game's code name is Parkside and, uh, basically this, yeah, it's like I said,

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.340
it's just matching up with what other people have said.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.540
So we can see if it's right or not when the game comes out.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.580
I'm glad to hear another Bioshock is on the way.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.820
Like I know, I know there's been rumblings, but it's been, it's been a long time since

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.220
we've had a Bioshock game.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.060
Bioshock Infinite is pretty aged.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.500
I think Bioshock Infinite can almost be a classic game of the week at this point.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.780
Maybe it's not that that old, but it's, it's close.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.780
It was a PS3 game, right?

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:58.780
Yes.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.820
So yeah, it's, uh, uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, feels like now's a good time for a Bioshock

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.820
game.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:05.820
Yeah, I think so.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.100
Uh, Questbuster in chat says a city at the foot of the mountains of madness.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.140
I just want to know how they're going to out twist all the other games.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.140
It'd be exciting.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.820
I want to know where the mountains of madness are so I never go there.

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.820
All right.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:22.220
Uh, just a few more stories and then we have the last flag here on orange lounge radio.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:25.580
If you don't know what I'm talking about, cause you were a newer listener, I'll explain

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.860
in just a few more stories.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.420
Yeah, no, we'll explain.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.420
We'll explain to me.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.420
All right.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.420
Uh, but first Loki.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.420
So yeah.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:39.580
So, um, Fortnite's completed their chapter two and part of that did kind of leak out.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:46.100
So they did this big finale, um, with a, I guess, cameo of the rock.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.820
Um, I can't remember the character he was playing.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.300
He's leader of the seven, I guess.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:55.020
Um, and I always get that confused because the seven is the name of the superhero group

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.980
and um, the boys.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.740
So that's also confusing.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:07.140
Um, but anyway, so he made a cameo in that and basically the whole island that you play

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:13.380
on flipped upside down and that is basically opening it up for season three, which then

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.300
the trailer leaf for that as well before to this whole event happened, but then they finally

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.240
released the official trailer.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.180
So some of the new things coming to season or chapter three, um, is that they're going

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.180
to have Spiderman in there as well.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:33.540
Um, you can do web slinging and they are going to have, uh, these, I guess, tents that you

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:38.500
can get or basically can kind of store your cache of weapons that you get through the

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500
different games.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.700
And you'll be able to take that with you into other games.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.620
Um, what else?

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.620
Oh, and sliding.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.880
They've added sliding as well, but it looks interesting.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.620
What about Kelly Clarkson?

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.300
Can't they add Kelly Clarkson to the game?

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.940
I mean, they probably could.

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.700
They gave us Ariana Grande and like, what, why have you, have you seen all the videos

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.080
of them duetting and stuff around the internet because of the voice and that stuff.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.500
If we have Ariana Grande, we need to have Kelly Clarkson.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.180
Like it's just, it's just Kelly Clarkson.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.140
Anybody can be in, in this game now.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.460
I mean, pretty much everything.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.460
Oh.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.540
And, uh, aside from experiment, they're also going to have the Gears worst characters in

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.540
there as well.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.100
Uh, that was something else that was shown off in the trailer because why not?

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.100
Yeah.

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.100
Yeah.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.380
So it's, it's interesting.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.660
When are they going to rename the game pop culture orgy?

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.100
Cause that's, that's what they're really going for with this and their, their own version

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.220
of the metaverse, I suppose.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.220
Interesting.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.820
I don't know.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.820
All right.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.180
Well, going over to a, another story here that has to do with, I think, I think one

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.300
of dark Sakura's favorite, um, gaming, uh, franchises, so I don't know why I'm talking

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.300
about it, but that's all right.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.900
I'll get, I'll get Jamie's reaction to it.

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.260
I did not know this.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:56.740
Apparently December 4th is dragon age for day because December and four D four.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.540
So December 4th is dragon age day.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.540
That's a stretch.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.260
It's a stretch, but you know how like end seven, November 7th is mass effect day.

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:06.660
I guess they've decided to December or December 4th is dragon age day.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.220
And we did get some updates on dragon age.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.660
No, we didn't get new trailer or anything like that, but there were some short stories.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:17.420
There was a story about gray wardens, which made me think of Jamie and her cosplay.

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.660
And there was a one about necromancers that they put up and they also have said the following

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:26.700
about dragon age for speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.460
We want to let you all know that we're still hard at work on building the next single player

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.740
focused experience for dragon age.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:36.420
We're excited for next year when we can talk more about what we're working on and what

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.420
a lot of people are looking at in that statement is, Oh yay.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.740
Single player focused.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.140
They're not going to try to shove multiplayer into it.

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.380
Like bio areas had to do with a lot of other games now.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.140
I don't know, like the multiplayer in mass effect three, I thought it was really underrated

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.500
and super fun.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.740
I'm not sure I really liked it in dragon age inquisition and got kind of old.

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.060
It was fun to do a couple of times.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:02.260
I don't know if Jamie, you felt any differently, but I, I, I kind of felt it got old and even

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.260
bother.

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.260
Yeah.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.420
So how do you feel when you hear that they're focusing on single player?

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.420
Makes me excited.

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.860
I'm like, why didn't they from the beginning, uh, pressure from EA would be the answer to

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.860
that.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.900
However, here's something interesting.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.300
This is what rumors say.

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:23.040
So read into this, what you will, but apparently dragon age four was going to be multiplayer

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:32.460
focused like Anthem was headed in that direction, but then Anthem came out and flop arena'd.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:38.980
But not only that star Wars, Jedi fallen order, a single player experience game came out and

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.660
did very well.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.460
So the rumor is EA backed off the multiplayer thing.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.660
And so Bioware is now focusing on single player, much to the rejoicing of many dragon age fans

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.660
everywhere.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.300
So it was not rejoicing.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.300
Yay.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.020
Hey, look, I'm fine with dragon age, having a multiplayer thing, have it a separate game.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:02.660
This is this, they just have it a separate thing that comes out that I would, I would

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:06.340
really, really, really love nothing more than a new mass effect multiplayer game to come

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.960
out to like bridge bridges.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.380
Just do a multiplayer only game.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:15.100
I would be so into it if it was like, even, I didn't hate Andromeda's multiplayer.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.300
It wasn't as good as threes, but I liked it enough.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.520
I'd be into it.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:28.660
So anyway, I'm, I'm perfectly happy with, with just having there being some sort of

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.500
separate thing if they were going to do it.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.340
I mean, that's just how I feel about it.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.340
Yeah, I agree.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.340
I agree.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.680
Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says they have a fucking day for everything now.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.780
Just call it every day day.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.780
Yeah.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.900
I think this one was a little bit of a stretch, but there you go.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.900
All right.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.060
Um, let's get to our last segment here that Jamie's going to introduce and something very

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.380
special about tonight.

01:15:49.380 --> 01:16:05.140
Uh, but first I'm going to roll this bumper and now it's time to travel back to a simpler

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.540
time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:18.540
It's time for the classic game of the week, but here in the calendar year, 2021 dark soccer

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:24.000
once a month picks a fucking weird arcade game to spotlight.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.100
And I think she's got one of the best of all here as the last pick.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:32.220
So once a month, the classic flag fucking weird arcade game of the month, dark soccer,

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.220
what did you pick?

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.060
I picked prop cycle.

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.060
Of course.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.060
Nice.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.180
It's fucking weird, but it's great in the best way, in the best way.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.180
Oh, totally.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.180
No.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.180
Prop cycle is great.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:51.420
Um, prop cycle came out when I was working at a Namco arcade and I have a lot of fond

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.060
memories of it.

01:16:53.060 --> 01:17:00.300
So in a nutshell, what this is, it is a 3d game with a focus on flying except you're

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:05.220
not flying a plane or a jet or even a hoverboard.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.700
You are on a bicycle with wings.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.980
Well, in the game it has wings.

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:19.540
So basically what you're doing is you are on this bike and you are doing your thing.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:25.500
You're moving along and you have to pop these bubbles and go through a balloon, sorry, and

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.540
go through these wings and everything.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:33.100
You're in this world that's like post this huge war.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:40.500
It was this hyperspace magnetic thing called the Tesla bomb was used in war and it destroyed

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:47.860
everything and it changed the world's terrain and then technology is now fueled by natural

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.860
resources.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:54.180
This game has like this whole like backstory and shit to it that's honestly pretty crazy.

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.460
I had no idea this game had a story.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.460
Right?

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:08.540
But you're going around on this flying thing called the laparopter.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:15.340
And so this one town, someone like did this thing with another thing.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:20.500
I know it's like, how did this happen?

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:28.220
And it ended up that you have to go in and find these energy balls and save the world

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.460
again against this event from happening.

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.220
And so that's where you are with it.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.980
You're having to go through and save the world by popping balloons.

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:53.060
And the prop cycle itself has, it really was considered to be one of the more original

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.060
things that came out.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.700
A lot of people went, fuck is this?

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.340
And part of the development team, it was also, I mean, they went out hand gliding to develop

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:05.860
the mechanics of the game.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:13.180
And they were also inspired by part of Kiki's delivery service with the flying on the balloon.

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:17.620
And they want to convey the sense of writing on the wind.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:23.420
So they have like a fan that blows on some of this.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.600
I don't know if they had it in all of them.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.820
Every single one that I have played has had it.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.820
Really?

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:29.820
Hmm.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.500
But they might've had some without.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:43.460
And they did actually add some different things in the plot to make it more appealing to people.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.780
And they were going to put a sightseeing mode in the game where you could just fly wherever

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:51.500
you want, where you had a time limit, you could just fly around, but they scrapped that

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.280
from there.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.620
It was considered the second most popular arcade game of August, 1996 in Japan.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:04.580
And certainly one of the most unique games that came out at that time.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:09.660
Now, the prop cycle has also played a part in pinball.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.020
Yes, in pinball.

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:17.460
And I'm sure people who know and have seen this know exactly what the hell I'm talking

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.460
about.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:23.580
Yes, I am talking about Prop Cycle Adam's family.

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:29.140
Prop Cycle has been hooked up.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:37.540
The cycle itself has been hooked up to an Adam's family pinball.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.020
And you play pinball while riding the prop cycle.

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:49.940
And the prop cycle fuels the power of the machines that you can keep playing.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:53.060
Of course, trying not to tilt on that sucker is hard as fuck.

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.900
But I digress.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:00.260
It actually is, I would say, pretty, pretty fun.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:05.060
Pretty fun to play and, you know, one of those very interesting things.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:18.860
I think that it's, what I'm thinking for it, it's one of those things that you would have

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:24.820
to see to believe and play even more to go, excuse me, what.

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.020
It sounds, excuse me, what, already.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.660
Well, I mean, it is already what, but it's even more what.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.980
It's pretty interesting.

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:39.740
And there's people who have these machines in their home, there's, I mean, I know that

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.580
the people have done some homebrew stuff, I couldn't find any, but it really is just,

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:49.660
you know, neat and whimsical.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:54.340
And it was a workout, trust me, when I was playing this, it was like, it was my workout.

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.700
It was my exercise bike when I worked at my arcade.

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.220
And the music is great.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:06.940
You know, it still is a game that holds up today as far as I think.

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.260
So there you go.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.260
Prop cycle.

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.260
Hurray.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.860
Love this game.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:17.220
I'm sorry, I may have missed this, but was there ever a home version of this?

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.940
Did they try?

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.660
I do not see that there was a home version.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.820
Um, nope.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.340
I mean, it would be hard because you can't exactly hook up an exercise bike and play

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.860
it or anything like that, but you would have, like, this is a game I would have totally

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.860
seen on the Dreamcast.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.540
You know what I mean?

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.540
It did not.

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.780
It did not have one.

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:40.220
On top of that, though, by the way, since I didn't mention it, it was on the M.C.O.'s

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.100
Super System 22.

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.080
And other games that were out on this, because this will definitely put it in the time frame,

01:22:49.080 --> 01:23:00.340
we had Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Time Crisis, Alpine Racer series, Aqua Jet.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.340
What else was there?

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:04.060
Yeah, I said Alpine Racer, didn't I?

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.060
Yeah.

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.140
So that era of games.

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.460
That's great.

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.460
And that's it.

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.460
All right.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.460
Mm hmm.

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.460
So there it is.

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.460
The last flag.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:20.500
And I don't have the wiki in front of me, I guess I should pull that up so we can recap

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.500
for the year.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.260
But that is going to be the last fucking weird arcade game.

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.460
I can get the wiki up.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.460
I'm working on it, too.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.460
So it'll be a race.

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.460
I've got it up right now.

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.460
Okay.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.020
So to recap for us, please, the 12 flags of 2021.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:47.740
Boonga Boonga, Tsukomi Yosei Gip's Nice Tsukomi, Ino no Osanpo, Cho Chabudai Gaishi, The Last

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:58.260
Bar Fighter, Stinky Feet, Sonic Blast Man, Final Furlong, Sega Toilet, The Typing of

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:01.100
the Dead, and now Prop Cycle.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.100
There it is.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.100
That was a good collection.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.100
Congratulations.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.180
Congratulations.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:10.940
Now I need people to message me to suggest what I'm going to be, what the crap I'm doing

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:13.780
next month, because I have not next month, but next year, because I have no freaking

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780
idea.

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.780
All right.

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:21.620
So send you send your suggestions for the 2022 twist at Dark Sakura on Twitter.

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.420
Jamie's been doing this for a few years now, right?

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:26.020
Like the first year was what was it?

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.020
Peripherals.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.020
I think it was the first year.

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.020
Right.

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.020
Because of the DDR mat and stuff.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:31.020
You forced.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.020
Actually, no, it was not.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020
It was system.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:38.940
It was the console of that was it system peripherals and peripherals and then a classic

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.940
eight soundtrack.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:40.940
Okay.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.940
And then classic pinball.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:42.940
Oh, yeah.

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.940
And then the flag.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.940
Wow.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.900
So this was the fifth year of a twist.

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.180
What a twist.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180
We need more twisties.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.180
I know.

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.180
Pretty sure the twist will need twists.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.460
All right.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.780
Um, love that.

01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.780
All right.

01:24:58.780 --> 01:24:59.780
But not chameleon twist.

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.780
All right.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.300
But don't worry if you're if you don't like twists.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.180
The other weeks out of the month, three or four, depending on how many shows we have

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.100
and how long the month is, end up being good old fashioned classic games and more and more

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:17.980
classic games become eligible every day, because really the only rule is that it should be

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:18.980
a game.

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.200
I guess there's been a rare exception to this, but for the most part, it needs to be a game

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.740
10 years older or more to be eligible for the classic game.

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:30.160
And way too many times on this show, we have ended up talking about games that we covered

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.120
when they were new.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.280
Now they're having games.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280
I know.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280
I know.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280
But 10 years is a long time.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.800
All right.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.300
Let's travel around the world quickly and check out some other news happening in gaming

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.600
with some rapid fire news.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.840
And I think we're going to start with Loki.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.840
Yep.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:54.280
Um, so we've got some wonderful stuff coming out.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.760
Starting with, uh, the battlefield 2042 players being mad at, well, EA.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.080
And the reason for that is because they put out some Santa skins.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.960
So the reason why they're mad is because typically this kind of goofy stuff is more along the

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:17.800
lines of what Call of Duty does and, you know, battlefield 2042, which was a hot mess as

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.860
it was when it came out is now selling these ridiculous Santa skins in their sort of realistic

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:29.260
somewhat realistic, you know, military shooter game.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.500
And so people just threw a big old fit about it.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:37.800
And I mean, they had like all sorts of like Fanta skins for their tanks and the helicopters

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.880
and stuff like that.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:45.200
But because of the backlash, they decided to go ahead and pull those skins.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:51.300
So they're not going to be selling them after all, uh, people.

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.300
It's a war on Christmas.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.140
No, I don't think it's a war on Christmas.

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.340
It's more of just that, like this game is a buggy mess.

01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.100
No, it's a Christmas on war.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.100
Absolutely.

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.100
I'm playable.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:07.140
And you're pushing, you're pushing DLC or like in-game purchases for this game that

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.140
it's not worth the money as it is.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.100
So that I think is that the fact that it's just stupid.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.540
I was making, making a joke though, I get it.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.020
I think, I think we need to check in everybody.

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:26.860
Could somebody visit the website gamershateeverything.com and let me know, do gamers still hate everything?

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.420
Could someone visit the website and let me know?

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.020
I hate everything and I'm a gamer.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:39.020
And then, um, so PlayStation Plus, we've got stuff coming out here for, um, I guess starting

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.400
in December.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:47.700
So they've got Lego DC Super-Villains on PlayStation 4, Mortal Shell on PlayStation 4 and Godfall

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:53.460
Challenger Edition on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is like your PlayStation 5 game.

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:58.900
The reason why people are upset about this is because Godfall Challenger Edition is basically

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:06.900
just three end game level modes called Lightbringer, Dreamstones and Ascending Tower of Trials.

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:14.020
Um, apparently it's like a glorified demo to the game, but you can pay to upgrade it

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.580
to the full game if you want.

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.100
So now, now they're just saying, you know, instead of the free PlayStation 5 game, it's,

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.260
oh, yeah, free demo.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.540
Cool, looking forward to that brand new PlayStation Games Pass service.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.620
And on this story, this is one of the things where, yes, gamers still hate everything and

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.780
I'm right there with them.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.300
This is, this is a stupid sale.

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:37.140
It's fine.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.020
Like even if I had a PlayStation 5, I wouldn't want to play Godfall anyways.

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.460
It doesn't look like a very good game and I don't think the reviews were too kind to it.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.780
So whatever.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:49.460
There's a lot of games that come out on these services that are not great.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.740
I mean, it is what it is, but yeah, the Godfall.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:58.500
Why not just, I think that's the point is that the entire retail game was nothing that

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.780
great if the critics are to be taken at face value.

01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.580
So why, why not just give us the fucking game?

01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:08.580
Like, don't give us this like bullshit extended trial or whatever it is.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:09.860
Give us the whole game.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.260
God, Dark Soccer.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:12.980
What do you have?

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:13.940
Maybe some better news?

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.860
Um, maybe.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:22.580
Um, so the next, uh, thing that's going to be on Nintendo 64 for Switch Online coming

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:26.740
out on December 10th is, uh, Paper Mario.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.220
And it's going to be on there with their, uh, online expansion pack.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.380
And, uh, it'll be really, really fun.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.140
Paper Mario was a really good one.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:44.340
Um, but, uh, we also know what else is coming as Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Kirby 64, Mario

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.300
Golf, Pokemon Snap, and Majora's Mask.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.020
So yay.

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:52.420
I'm glad that, uh, I've got the upgrade.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.020
And glad they're going nice and slow and adding those games.

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.220
Well, but they're adding quality.

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:05.940
And then, um, then there's a new, uh, crossover going on for, uh, Virtua Fighter,

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.220
Five Ultimate Showdown.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:11.140
We are going to have, um, Yakuza characters in Virtua Fighter.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.620
And I still don't care for Virtua Fighter, but Yakuza characters are going to be pretty fun.

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.380
So cool.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.000
Yep.

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.980
I think it's a fun crossover.

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.420
Indeed it is.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.660
Dark Tetsuya in chat about the Paper Mario on Switch Online says,

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.980
sadly, I think that's it for NSO in December.

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:35.380
As far as I know, you mean Nintendo abandoned the non-expansion pack stuff already?

01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.060
LeGasp.

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.460
I mean, color me shocked people.

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.220
I'm so surprised.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.220
Look at my surprise face.

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:45.720
Exactly.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:47.000
All right.

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.820
Let's travel around the world.

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.500
Do you have to hate everything?

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.060
Yes.

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:51.700
Do you have to?

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.980
Did you go to the website gamershateeverything.com?

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.580
It says right there.

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.140
Yes.

01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:58.420
You have to let it linger.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.060
And it even says it in Comic Sans just for you.

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:01.560
All right.

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:02.840
Rob.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.180
What?

01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:04.740
Do you have to?

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.180
Um, let's move on.

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:10.660
We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates,

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:15.700
some things that, um, are coming out, um, that you can buy new games instead of emulated ones.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:21.060
So let's get, can you guys hear Mr. Smoosh playing with his new toy before we get to this?

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:21.860
Okay.

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:22.660
Thank God.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:26.980
Because although I'm not, I don't hear him through our microphone, but yeah.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.300
Okay.

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:32.740
So Alan bought him a new toy at the Bougie pet store that we have to get his food at.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.940
Cause our, our cat won't settle for meow mix.

01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:37.700
He has to have the nicest stuff.

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:41.220
So Alan decided to get him a new toy and it's a little squeaky toy.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.420
So it's a little mouse that you chase around and go squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:45.620
Well, that's great.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.940
Except like, it'll be like dead silence.

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.780
Like I'm sitting there on the computer.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.180
Alan has his headphones on the room's completely silent.

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:55.060
And then from the hallway, I just hear squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.140
It's like this little squeaky mouse going off.

01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.420
And now I'm hearing it during the show.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.860
He's over there playing with it, which is fine.

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.220
I want Mr. Smoosh to be entertained.

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.060
I think it's funny, but yeah.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.460
Anyway, I just don't want to come through on air.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.420
Cause it sounds a little weird.

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:07.380
All right.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.380
Let's get to release dates.

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.060
We'll start with the U S Loki.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:12.100
Yes.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:15.300
So we have Final Fantasy 14 and Walker coming out on PC,

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.220
Mac PlayStation, PlayStation five.

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:23.860
Spell force three reinforced on PC.

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:28.660
Halo infinite on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series X.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:34.260
Uh, loop hero on Nintendo switch, uh, monster hunt or I'm sorry.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.660
Monster rancher one and two deep Lux.

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:40.420
Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch and iOS.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:41.700
And that's it.

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:43.460
All right.

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.820
Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:51.780
Um, on the Nintendo switch this week, we have Valise.

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:55.300
The Phantasm soldier collection is out on December the ninth.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.540
Monster rancher one and two DX.

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.700
It's a 25th anniversary box limited edition also out in Japan this week.

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.420
Uh, and, uh, let's see fit boxing too.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.820
Uh, that comes with a special joy con attachment.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.180
I guess it's a boxing thing.

01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.380
Uh, also out this week.

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:13.300
YouTubers life too is actually getting released in Japan.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.860
I watched a friend of mine play this on Twitch a little bit.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.540
Uh, it looks really silly.

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:17.780
Yeah.

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:20.420
It's I, but it does say it is an English.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.180
It doesn't look like they've done anything to localize it for Japan,

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:26.740
but it is being released, uh, physically on the switch over there.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.180
So I thought that was interesting.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:33.300
Um, Alba a wildlife adventure also on Japan, uh, Sakuna of rice and ruin.

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.380
That game came out, uh, about a year ago, I think,

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:36.980
but it is now getting a price reduction.

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:41.060
So it re-released with that as it moves into best price collection,

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.900
uh, on the switch this week in Japan.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:48.020
Monopoly and monopoly madness also out in Japan this week.

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:51.780
Um, that's a lot of releases for switch, but that's what we've got.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:56.100
Let me peek at the PlayStation five real quick to see if anything is out there.

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.420
Um, dying light to stay human.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.420
That is out on PlayStation five this week.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.380
So I guess that's kind of a worldwide thing this week.

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:06.100
And then quickly peeking at the PlayStation four.

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:10.980
Um, we have, uh, some of the same stuff like YouTubers life too,

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:12.740
is actually also out on PS four.

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:18.020
Uh, the crisis remastered trilogy is also out this week on PS four,

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:21.380
uh, that same Sakuna of rice and ruin also on PlayStation four.

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.820
Monopoly plus monopoly madness, all that good stuff also there as well.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.860
And, um, street fighter five championship edition, all character pack.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:33.620
So if you want to have the Uber version of that, that is getting

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.340
a type of retail re-release in Japan this week.

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:37.620
How about the UK dark Sakura?

01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:41.460
In the UK, we have actually just come out.

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.420
We have never song.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:48.580
We have on the seventh gear club, uh, unlimited to ultimate addition.

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:53.140
We have on the seventh as well, gang beasts for switch.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:00.260
Um, beyond a steel sky steel book edition on the eighth, we have halo infinite, um,

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:05.220
on the ninth monopoly madness on the 10th, the eternal cylinder for Xbox.

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.580
And that's it for the week.

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.040
All right.

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.060
Sure.

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:12.340
The year's going to wind down pretty soon here with the releases.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.740
Um, but then it'll pick right back up, uh, early next year, uh, with, uh,

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.300
all the stuff they've got to get out before the end of the financial year.

01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:20.420
All right.

01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.140
For sure.

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.500
Just a few more stories for you guys.

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.700
And then we'll open it up to emails and your calls maybe.

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.060
And all that good stuff, uh, with our listener round table, but first,

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:31.220
Oh, I'm sure Loki had to talk about this.

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.260
This is too funny, right?

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:32.660
Loki.

01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:33.620
Yeah.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:38.500
So all these convenient glitches and bugs that we have in some of the new

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.420
Nintendo games are yes, it's hilarious.

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:49.620
So we've got an animal crossing, uh, new horizons, uh, DLC issue.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:55.300
So the happy home paradise DLC is causing some of the characters

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.660
clothes not to appear.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:01.780
So they're walking around naked in the game, or at least without clothes.

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.580
Um, Hey, you know what?

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.620
They just want to be free.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.900
They just want to, they just want to live the way they came into the world.

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.400
Come on.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.740
There's going to probably be doing some updates to fix that.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:16.820
So, um, Nintendo, you think, I think.

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.380
And then apparently, uh, Brit Pokemon, brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.460
They have a glitch to one year.

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.180
Um, what was it you're doing?

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:30.020
Like the surf technique or something like that on the water that it makes it

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:33.140
look like that the Pokemon are mounting each other.

01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:38.420
So that's something else that's probably going to have to be patched as well.

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.200
Wow.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:41.560
Yeah.

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:43.300
Only Nintendo.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.300
They can't be bothered to put new stuff on Nintendo switch online for the, uh,

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.740
lower tier users, but they're going to make catch up, put some goddamn

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.100
clothes on, on that Island.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.140
That's for sure.

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:58.020
They know sex sells, you know, got to entice the new players.

01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:00.840
All right.

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:05.700
Well, actually a series that, uh, we've talked about a lot that is on the switch,

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.820
uh, is expanding, uh, to new platforms this week.

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:14.420
Uh, ACA or the arcade archives has some releases that are coming out on iOS and

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.220
Android.

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.260
This is notable because this is AKA Neo Geo specifically, and this is its first

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.140
foray than I think.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:25.780
I think arcade archives may already be on, um, uh, iOS, Android, but Neo Geo,

01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:28.660
uh, this is the first releases that we're seeing on mobiles.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.940
So we have alpha mission two metal slug five and samurai showdown four.

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.460
I'm acoustic revenge.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:39.620
So if any of those are titles that you, uh, recall from the Neo Geo days or just

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:45.300
things you want to check out, they are available on iOS and Android for 3 99.

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.500
So four bucks.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:51.940
Um, this series was previously only PlayStation four, Xbox one, windows 10 and

01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.740
switch.

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:55.300
Um, so they are apparently now available.

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.460
So you can check that out if you want.

01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.100
Um, which I know metal slug and samurai showdown.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.940
I don't remember alpha mission two.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.380
Probably if I watched it in motion, I I'd remember it.

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.500
These are some later Neo Geo games.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.140
So it's interesting.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.060
They're kind of starting here, but that's pretty cool.

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:15.380
Uh, you can do a virtual pad customization, uh, and all this stuff.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:19.620
They have online rankings and button settings and yeah, all that good stuff.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:25.780
So fun to see that, uh, come out to the phones be very interesting if they do get

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:30.900
into a console archives place later, as was that rumor, uh, a few weeks ago that

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.580
we talked about here on the show.

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.940
I would love to see them get into that.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:34.580
That's for sure.

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.180
Um, Dar Sakura.

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:43.460
So, um, we have a release of Shin Megami Tensei five.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.660
It is out.

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:49.460
There is an update, um, that has camera angles and brightness adjustment

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.500
available to it.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.180
Um, it also helps you adjust the field of view.

01:38:54.980 --> 01:39:02.100
You, uh, can, uh, change, uh, uh, you actually reduces the number of gimmicks

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.660
for jumps after the lay line in a certain area.

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.820
They just basically did some general bug fixes.

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:13.140
And, uh, really the, the depth of view on there is actually pretty intense.

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:17.140
Looking at some of these, uh, differences as are the brightness effects.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.260
It's actually really cool.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.540
So there you go.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.500
You can go ahead and get it.

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.700
Yep.

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:25.300
I have some friends that have been playing the game and, and, uh, really enjoying it.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.460
So it's one of those series that, you know, if I had more time, I'd make,

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.980
but these games are like a long time to beat if I'm not mistaken.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.580
So it's just one of those games.

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:38.420
I just haven't gotten around to yet, but someday, someday, uh, Loki.

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.420
All right.

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:47.140
Um, so let's talk about, I, I really hate take two sometimes.

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:54.260
Um, but so take two is now coming after, um, the publisher of the game.

01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:58.340
It takes two, which was that kind of, uh, I don't know.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:02.820
It was like sort of a cute, like co-op puzzle game that they had.

01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:08.580
Um, and I think this came out a while ago, but now they're just coming after him because,

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:13.300
you know, the name, the trademark for the name sounds too close.

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:19.700
Um, apparently though, uh, yeah, I don't know.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:24.580
I think the haze light said that it can't comment on ongoing disputes,

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.500
but hopefully that it will be resolved.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:28.340
I hope they drop this.

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.140
This is ridiculous.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:32.500
I get it that you have to protect your trademarks and stuff like that, but there's

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:36.980
no confusion between take two, the publisher and it takes two.

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.220
This is, this is definitely an overreach and is definitely just, uh, somebody being a little

01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:45.060
bit too trigger happy about the whole, if you don't defend your trademark, you lose

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:45.780
it type of thing.

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.540
So, um, very silly, very, very silly.

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.100
Um, and hopefully they settle it quickly.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:57.060
So, um, S2100 Matt says, I really hope take two wins just out of spite.

01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.020
Why would you say that?

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:02.580
Or are you just, are you making a joke because they're both named take two?

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:03.060
I don't know.

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:05.860
I don't want to take two to win.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.060
I want it takes two to win.

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:12.820
Um, yeah, it takes two should win and then they lose their trademark for take two.

01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:13.700
That'd be funny.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.020
Yeah.

01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.540
Oh, that would be funny.

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:20.340
Um, Oh, S2100 Matt says, I mean, wins game of the year at the game awards.

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.540
Oh, okay.

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.260
That would be funny.

01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:22.500
Okay.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.140
I'm with you there.

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.260
Um, that'll be interesting.

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:27.140
Uh, yeah.

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:31.300
Orange right in chat says Rob base and DJ easy rock, not available for comment.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.060
I see what you did there for what it's worth.

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.260
All right, moving on.

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:39.460
It takes two to make Sue somebody, right?

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.580
It takes two to really start a fight.

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.300
All right.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:47.860
Um, now I'm going to get sued.

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:48.180
All right.

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.060
As I probably deserve it.

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:51.460
All right.

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:55.780
Um, moving on to, uh, one more story here.

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.340
Uh, you guys are too much.

01:41:58.340 --> 01:41:58.900
I'm sorry.

01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:04.020
I have to read this comment from Sia Tabiri who says, but how did the Olson twins who

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:04.980
starred in the movie?

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.540
It takes to feel about the situation.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.820
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:11.780
My reaction.

01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.500
Exactly.

01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:18.900
I'm sorry, but I'm giving Sia Tabiri the gold star comment of the night award.

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.260
Congratulations.

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.780
You win 50 internets.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.100
Yes.

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.460
You win points.

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.020
You win internet points worth nothing.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:28.500
You know what?

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:34.580
I have some Travis Donovan space bucks that fell from his station when, um, he, uh, closed

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.620
under station life.

01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:38.100
So I have some Travis Donovan fun bucks for you.

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.620
Sia Tabiri, please enjoy.

01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:41.460
All right.

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.180
I'm the fan of the no prize.

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:48.660
The old, uh, no prize that Marvel did.

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:49.620
Right.

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:51.540
All right.

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:58.260
Uh, Hey, this is a prize and a real tweet, uh, tweet treat, uh, for those that, uh, bought

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:02.580
quake when it was re-released, you know, that remaster that they put out recently, uh, on

01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:03.220
PC.

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.700
And I know it's on Xbox and all that good stuff.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:10.820
Um, this was back in August when they released it, even the switch got this and now this

01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:11.540
is pretty cool.

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:15.380
They have updated quake a 25 year old game.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:17.940
They've gone, but not just the remaster, but now they've updated it.

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:21.140
There is a new co-op hoard mode.

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.260
So that's kind of cool.

01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.940
So yeah, now you can do a little more.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.180
Yeah.

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.940
Like PVE type of thing in the game.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:26.660
So that's cool.

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:29.620
And there's new maps that they're putting in and another campaign.

01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:33.380
And of course, bug fixes because who doesn't love bug fixes.

01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.740
So that's great.

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.180
And this just came out this last week.

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.740
It's update two for quake, uh, machine games built the hoard mode.

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:44.020
And, uh, this is the studio that was behind the Wolfenstein revivals.

01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:49.380
You can play this by yourself or up to three friends, and there are four new maps to support

01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.100
the role.

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.620
So that's, that's great.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:54.900
There's also one more expansion called honey.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:44:00.020
It's a dark and creepy underground town, uh, with more secrets, more enemies, you know,

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:03.220
typical quake stuff, shoot it in the face, et cetera, et cetera.

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.460
I, I, I'm a fan of the quake remaster, but I have really fond memories of the original

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:13.540
to go back to, uh, playing that over the internet, uh, via modem when I was in the college dorms.

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.900
So it's pretty awesome.

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:20.740
Dr. Suya says it's been a little while since I've been on quake.

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:21.940
So might need to fire it up again.

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:26.340
I remember the original team fortress, not the fortress two, but the OG team fortress,

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:31.620
which was a quake mod, because that's where valve got a lot of their people were the modding

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.100
community.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:33.060
That's where Dota came.

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.260
Dota two came from as well.

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.300
It was a Warcraft three mod.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.660
One thing valve is really good at.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.860
Yeah.

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.860
I wonder why they stopped doing that.

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.260
All right.

01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.100
Anyway, um, that was it.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.500
That was the last story I had slotted for tonight.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.020
So we're going to get to the listener round table.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.860
We're going to take your questions and chat.

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:54.340
We're also going to welcome your calls in the green room over at, uh, I almost said

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.940
twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.740
Well, that's the place to send questions too, but also at vog network.com slash discord.

01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:04.340
You can join our discord community and we get sent stories throughout the week, which

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:04.980
is really cool.

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.140
And then you can chat about the shows.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:09.860
Uh, we, we, the hosts check in once in a while too.

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.540
You can send things to us.

01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:17.620
I got sent earlier today, a Ninja turtles cross golden girls fanfic shirt or something

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.780
that, uh, it was because I am a golden girl fan, uh, at heart.

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.700
My only concern is that the golden girls are like literally everywhere at this point.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.860
And it's almost, it's almost becoming too much.

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:28.660
I just, you know what?

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:32.820
I like reruns on TV or Hulu or whatever.

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.260
That's where I like my golden girls.

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:35.220
Anyway.

01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.780
Um, let's get to the mailbag, participate at orange long trader.com.

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:44.020
If you want to send us an email, uh, I think we had at least one when I went to just one.

01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:44.500
All right.

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:44.900
Go forward.

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:53.620
So, um, the one email we have, dear Rob, first off, you're, you're a wonderful human being

01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:57.140
and you have brought thousands of hours of happiness to my life through the power of

01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:58.260
this podcast.

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:07.620
However, however, Rob, I got something to say, please do not assume that people wouldn't

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:11.140
be upset if Square Enix botched your remake of chrono cross.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:14.340
That game to me is what chrono trigger is to you and others.

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:18.500
It told a heart-wrenching story that had me in tears within the first hour.

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.260
Those characters, that irreplaceable soundtrack, the unique battle system.

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.220
It's fucking great.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.380
I typed this email while on a late night walk outside on my phone.

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.780
So I apologize for any grammatical mistakes.

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.660
You were fine.

01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:36.580
I just had to respond to that comment when I heard it with love for the OLR fan, Garth

01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:37.060
Wolf.

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:43.060
All I have to say is there's, there's always gotta be that guy.

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:44.580
Congratulations.

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.220
But what about this?

01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.260
No, I, I get it.

01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.940
Look, your, your feelings are valid.

01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:55.940
Certainly everybody has interesting emotional connections to games that maybe not everybody

01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.220
else feels the same way too.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:01.140
Like, you know, we never shut up about the guardian legend and how amazing that game

01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:04.100
is and how we'd love to revisit it if done right someday.

01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.860
But the reality is a lot of people don't know about that game.

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.060
And so if they never came out with one, a lot of people would probably be none the wiser.

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:17.060
Um, but sure, uh, with Chrono Cross, of course there were people that played it and really,

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.860
really, especially, and I think a lot of it might have to do with your age too.

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:25.300
Like, uh, you know, Bobby's said this before and I tend to agree with it that your favorite

01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.580
Final Fantasy game is probably the one that was out when you were 12.

01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:34.340
Um, and for me, that was probably around Final Fantasy four, maybe technically probably two

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.740
and three in Japan, but probably about Final Fantasy four.

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:41.700
And yeah, that probably, I don't know, Final Fantasy six has aged so well, but I would

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.900
say four is definitely up there.

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.060
I probably like four more than most people do.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.580
And I think there's something to that.

01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:51.940
And I would bet you were probably knowing your age, you were probably around 12 when

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.140
Chrono Cross came out.

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:58.100
And so that game probably has a lot of meaning to you just because of that particular moment

01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:58.900
in your life.

01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:02.980
And nothing some asshole says on a podcast is ever going to ruin that.

01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:04.020
Remember that.

01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.100
So, you know, treasure those memories.

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:11.700
But Dark Sakura will ruin you if you, if you deserve it.

01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:14.180
I will ruin a bitch.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.340
I'm good at that too.

01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.140
All right.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:18.180
Thank you for the email though.

01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.140
Especially the first part.

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:20.260
All right.

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:20.900
Appreciate it.

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.020
Again, if you want to send us an email, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:26.900
an email.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:30.020
I see a dear friend of the show has stepped into the green room.

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.100
I know we want to get some last minute stories from Loki here, if there are any first.

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.060
Okay, well, great.

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:35.700
Well, then good.

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.220
We have extra time for calls.

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.700
So let's get to, uh, some calls.

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.260
Hello.

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.860
You're on orange lounge radio.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:42.340
Who's this?

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:45.940
Two episodes in a row of extended conversation with me.

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:46.820
Are you sick of me yet?

01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:47.940
Not at all.

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.580
Never.

01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:51.380
And, uh, you know, Jason, you do great work for the show.

01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:56.100
People don't realize I was very late in providing a show content tonight because I was out doing

01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:56.340
stuff.

01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.180
I was walking and stuff, you know, my health comes first, but no, seriously, like Jason

01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:02.100
put together tonight's intro and like 10 minutes.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.060
It was pretty impressive.

01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:03.780
So congrats.

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.500
Thank you.

01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.500
I gotta, I gotta, you know, the, the obvious fallback is that since I can see your folks

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.380
preparation as well, I can pick on that.

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:16.020
Generally, you have all of the stories in there, but it's certainly given that I went

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:21.220
with the, you know, the very meta overview of everything going on and not one particular

01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:21.620
story.

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.700
It was a much more, it was a much easier list.

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:27.460
There have been weeks and it's been my fault, not yours.

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:30.820
You provide a great service to the show, but in the past, I'm thinking probably even in

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.980
the pre Twitch days where, um, I would, you, you would do that.

01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:38.180
You would pick the show from the article and it wasn't something I show.

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.620
Yeah, I remember a couple of times.

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:42.900
So I would, I would have to just say, Oh, by the way, I want to talk about this during

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:44.980
rapid fire news for reasons.

01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:48.180
So all good, all good.

01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.060
We all appreciate.

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:54.980
I love it when you sneak in, you use your intro to sneak in your opinion in that 32nd

01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:58.900
time slot or whatever long, however long the loop is.

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:01.620
Actually, you guys may not, we'll let you peek behind the curtain a little bit.

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.220
Jason does have two versions of that intro.

01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:10.260
If I remember right, there's one that has an extra loop of one of the measures in it.

01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:13.380
So Jason can have like eight more seconds to say something if he needs it.

01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:14.340
Yeah.

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:19.060
I don't even remember when we put it to use, God, that was like, what, four or five months

01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:22.580
ago or something about that, but there was something, yeah, there was something that

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.900
I definitely wanted to, I definitely wanted to drill into a lot more apparently.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:30.180
So it's like, well, music is loopable.

01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:36.100
The composition is very well put together and has a couple key points.

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.060
You're very welcome.

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:41.380
Has a couple of key points that are easy to just, you know, move off of and extend.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:47.860
And it sounds very natural between a good composition with well-defined breaks and also

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:53.380
software that makes it stupid easy these days to just, Hey, I want to repeat this section.

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.100
Okay.

01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.220
And there was an, and no disrespect for logic pro right.

01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:02.100
And, and no disrespect to our old intro, because that was given to us by somebody who was going

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:07.380
to put it on an album at one point and basically couldn't find the right, uh, match for it,

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:08.820
but thought it made a good bump.

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:11.300
And anyway, gave it to us for the intro for our show.

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.500
But, uh, and we loved it.

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.740
We used it for over a decade here on the show and shout out to midi head who put that together.

01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:22.980
If he even, if he even makes music anymore, but there was that little time frame in there

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:27.300
that couldn't be changed because it was just like the music wasn't really loopable or

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:28.020
anything like that.

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:32.820
So, uh, but now with this new one, we have the ability to, if we want to have a longer

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.260
intro tonight, we can do that.

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:39.780
The actual video that pans around the studio and also goes on for like two minutes.

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:44.500
So technically if Jason wanted to have like a two minute intro, we could do it, but I'm

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.380
careful what you wish for.

01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:51.220
I have, I have thought about things and yeah, you're not wrong.

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.260
Be careful what you wish for.

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.340
Some of these days, uh, I, uh, geez, I think it was the last time I was in the studio.

01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:00.580
I made the, I made the joke that one of these days, the intro you're going to get is it

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:06.580
was a colder and stormy night on December 5th in Sacramento, California, when the leaves

01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.620
were changing color.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:07.860
Yeah.

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:08.580
Anyways.

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:11.780
Uh, I just, I agree with pod culture for an April fool intro.

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:14.580
I think you just, you should just start the show in the intro.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.500
Anyway, uh, we can have an extended conversation now though.

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:21.620
What did you want to talk about tonight?

01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:22.420
Yeah.

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:27.460
So I actually wanted to, I wanted, I did want to give an opinion and I wanted to expand

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.980
on the dig that I put in the very, very start of the intro.

01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:36.260
Um, basically like the, the point that I'm making, and I'm gonna explain it a little

01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:37.060
bit more broadly.

01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.300
The point I played, should I play the intro again?

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.660
But if you have it on, if you have it on, yeah, absolutely.

01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.140
I do.

01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.420
I'm just going to warn you actually won't hear it, but the listeners will.

01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.780
So I'll tell you when we're on the other side.

01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:48.980
So here's a reminder here.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.100
Oh my God.

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:51.380
The show's starting over.

01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:51.620
No.

01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:04.900
It's another week and another groundswell launch with rampant service issues.

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:09.300
But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe, mashups,

01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:13.060
ongoing social sagas, new release, strife, remasters, and rereleases, and a couple of

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:13.620
glitches.

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:17.300
It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums and video games.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.140
The things we hold near and dear to our hearts.

01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:23.860
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:24.740
of all this and more.

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:26.980
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:29.460
All right, there you go.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.780
Hello, everybody out there on the internet.

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:35.780
And I'm going to, I'm going to let this video keep playing so you can see how long it is

01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:36.900
while Jason gives his thoughts.

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:37.780
So there's the intro.

01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:43.060
Groundswell launch was my two big words.

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:46.660
What were the two big words also saying that like, this isn't news.

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:50.500
Because it's not, you know, every multiplayer launch.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:51.540
Diablo 3.

01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:55.380
I mean, I guess No Man's Sky wasn't exactly live multiplayer.

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.100
I don't remember them having server issues at launch.

01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.500
But like this, and I said this, you read out the comment when I said it when we were talking

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:03.620
in the intro in chat.

01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.820
This problem will not be solved.

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:07.300
Period.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.260
It is not going to be.

01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:10.820
Like there's always going to be a reason given for it.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:11.860
You had your opinion.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:16.740
Yoshi P had Yoshi T.

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.660
Yoshi P right.

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:19.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.340
He had his opinion about the supply chain aspect of it, which is true.

01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:27.060
But it doesn't explain why every other one in the past is hard.

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.300
Scaling is hard.

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:30.500
I mean, look at Twitter.

01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:36.500
The fail whale was such a prominent thing in history because scale is hard.

01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:44.420
Yeah, like you can you can point to any service growing up or just launching this is what

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:47.300
Final Fantasy 14 fifth expansion.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:53.060
It depends if you count Realm Reborn as an expansion or the base game.

01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.180
Well, it's true.

01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.820
I consider Realm Reborn the base game.

01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.940
Because that is what everything else is built on now.

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:04.340
But anyway, computing follows human analogs.

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.860
Computing is not different.

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:06.820
It's just another medium.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:11.700
I've talked about social networks in the past and Facebook is having all of these social

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:16.100
problems because of the large public town square problem that every single community

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:16.500
happens.

01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:18.740
Final Fantasy 14.

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:20.900
Picture it as a mall.

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:26.660
It has tons of entrances to individual stores, to general common areas.

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:28.340
When does it suck the most?

01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:31.860
Black Friday and December 24th.

01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:38.180
And all of the summer days when the kids can just come in at will, you know, like every

01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:40.900
critical mass is difficult everywhere.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:43.700
These problems will not go away.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.380
And if they are like it's going to it's going to fucking bankrupt the company that finally

01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:51.300
doesn't write because they're going to be so severely over provisioned that, you know,

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:56.980
they're going to blow they're going to blow all their profit and then some because and

01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:02.740
if it's and even even if they over provision, especially in computing, even if Square Enix

01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:09.700
set up three more data centers filled with 500 more servers to do everything.

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:12.580
Some other component in the middle is going to break down.

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:16.740
DNS is going to break and some some players aren't going to be able to connect.

01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:21.060
Interconnection is going to is going to break between data servers and some segment of players

01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:21.860
are going to get dropped off.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:26.100
Some servers are going to go down like these are not solved problems.

01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:31.300
Servers a service is a mall service is the stores.

01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:37.700
You have everybody jamming into a single store and they have to queue up to pay for their

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:43.460
items and you have, you know, one or few cash registers that everybody has to go through.

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.220
Some people leave because they have time commitments and they didn't anticipate the line.

01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.620
You have rabble rousers that's put the put the line to a stop because they complain incessantly

01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:54.420
about everything and all the other people immediately after.

01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.060
Well, I'm just not going to be around for the conflict, so they peace out.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.340
There are too many things that happen down in the weeds.

01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:08.340
That means that this can just be solved by just, oh, let's just have three more stores

01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:09.860
in the mall that are all Macy's.

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.980
That's probably a bad example.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.500
How how relevant is Macy's?

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.340
Let's let's have the dial turn up the graphics on level three, right?

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:20.500
That doesn't fix it for for every possible reason.

01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:26.420
So like it's a I don't have an answer this because like I said, my answer is that it's

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:27.700
not it's non-resolvable.

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:33.380
These are things we deal with at scale in excess and it is a fact of life.

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:34.180
What does that mean?

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:40.020
That means you get in on day one and have a subpar experience or don't get in on day

01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:46.820
one and let the traffic die down, which is the solution in all cases unless they do so

01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.540
that the company does something critically wrong and just folds up to that point.

01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:52.500
But this is this will not be a solved problem ever.

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:58.900
And if it is, they lied about thousands of people beating down the front door when it

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.220
was maybe 50 that they had to cater to.

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:04.180
Like that's I do not see a third option.

01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:05.620
That is the way I see it.

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:10.340
They lie about the demand or it or you will have problems.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.140
Period.

01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:11.640
Yeah.

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:12.500
Yeah.

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:15.380
And Zen Monkey 11 in chat says it will be solved with more servers.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:20.100
And I think that that is but then it's funny because then when you put then you get Wow's

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:24.100
problem, you have too many servers, then the population starts dying and the servers feel

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:24.580
empty.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:29.460
Now Wow did a really smart thing with the whole like cross server thing that is so seamless

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:32.020
in that game, which Final Fantasy 14 has really struggled with.

01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:36.660
Like they're just now getting to data center travel, hopefully in 6.1.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:40.420
But after this whole mess, I would not be surprised if that gets put off a little bit

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.180
because here's something that's very interesting.

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:47.940
And they were touting this feature that was supposed to be in the 6.0 thing that within

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:53.700
your data center, you could automatically queue for the world with the lowest pop with

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:56.340
the lowest queue, lowest line to get in.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.100
But here's the hilarious part.

01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:02.900
That feature doesn't work right now because when it consistently tries to load your character

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:08.340
data, which is needed for that future feature, it keeps timing out because there are literally

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:12.100
like everybody else requesting their player data.

01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:15.940
And that's exactly my point of these auxiliary things.

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:22.580
Like the DNS system has to work out the centralized storage of something that spans multiple stores

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:31.060
like iPhone launches, you know, new phone launches, like those all boil down to physical

01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:36.660
stock and what, you know, three large tier providers and maybe all of these other little

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:42.740
offshoots, US Cellular and I mean, Ting is just a sub to Verizon and all that kind of

01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:42.820
thing.

01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:45.060
How about a fucking PlayStation 5?

01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:46.980
Why don't we just use that as an example?

01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:49.620
I still can't get one, you know, like.

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:51.620
Yeah.

01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:55.220
And that's, I don't want to draw that comparison.

01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:00.500
I mean, I do because it's not like, yes, digital is digital and you can just copy and paste

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:03.460
infinitely, but those all take storage somewhere.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.740
Those all take bandwidth.

02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.660
That all takes routing power.

02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:09.780
Yeah, it is not ultimately all that different.

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:10.820
Common denominator.

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.140
Yeah.

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:16.900
Is that the superconductor shortage is screwing the PlayStation 5 and the superconductor shortage

02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:22.340
screwed the contingency plans that, you know, to basically turn up the graphics and turn

02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:24.740
up the server space that they had in place.

02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:28.660
So basically gaming is fucked right now because a crypto coin.

02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:32.420
That is all true for this year.

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:34.580
It's going to happen on Final Fantasy.

02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:39.060
Let's call it 17 or the next or the next expansion.

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:45.060
Like it's going to happen again, even with society getting back to a, you know, surplus

02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:49.700
possible situation because it happened in all years prior to coin mining and everything

02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:51.540
else like scaling.

02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:57.060
Scaling is hard for everyone ever always, period.

02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:59.700
There is no ifs, ands or buts about it.

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:05.700
This is, I have this thing that I say whenever I can distill it down this concretely.

02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:12.020
Technology doesn't fix social problems and scaling is a social problem.

02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.420
It's just in the service and technical world.

02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:19.780
It's very highly a technological problem, but it underpins people, society and social

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:20.500
events.

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:22.420
Technology does not fix social problems.

02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:24.660
These are evergreen problems.

02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:26.100
They will not be resolved.

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:27.620
And what does that mean?

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:34.660
That means that we're going to complain and suffer and we will perpetually have to deal

02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:35.140
with it.

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:38.180
And, you know, I'm not saying don't have the conversation about it.

02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.420
I'm just saying don't be surprised by it.

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:44.820
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they can also solve it for the time being by giving every player

02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.980
or server a set play time, like a two hour long log or whatever.

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:50.100
Then they log you out.

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:52.020
You know, there's that noise.

02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:53.860
Yeah, there's a part of that I get.

02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:57.140
But at the same time, like what if you're in the middle of an instance playing with

02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:59.620
other people when you hit your two hours is up, you know?

02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:03.140
And what if the timer starts when you queue and not when you actually start playing?

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:03.780
Whoops.

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:06.180
There'd be a lot of like I get that solution.

02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:08.100
It does seem like on paper that's a good way to do it.

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:12.660
But I just think in practice, it's going to cause even more frustration and that whole

02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:13.540
type of thing.

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:19.620
I really think the answer here and I think what Yoshi P and Square need to take a good

02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:20.100
look at.

02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:23.620
Is it a good idea to release so much content at once?

02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:29.860
And I think maybe I know that is such a weird thing that I'm saying, but maybe the answer

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:31.300
is maybe they should.

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.180
That's why that's why I'm saying delay the raid.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:38.900
Do not add to this issue by making people feel like they got a gun so fast to get to

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.180
that raid and all this stuff.

02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:44.820
I think if they had, you know, I said earlier, they probably should have delayed Endwalker

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:45.540
again.

02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:49.220
But you know what they could have done that might have helped a little bit with this?

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:53.300
And maybe if as they're sitting down looking at their lessons learned, what if they had

02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.860
released the new jobs Reaper and Sage on Friday?

02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.580
And then you know what?

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:02.420
We'll release the story in January.

02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:07.380
It's just about the people like that may that may have softened.

02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:10.260
Anything can soften the blue.

02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:14.100
Anything can soften the blow and incremental solutions should be possible, but it's not

02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.380
going to fix it.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:22.660
Rocket League, Rocket League's season five under Epic just started two weeks ago.

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:28.500
And like the skill level at the start of the season is completely different than the skill

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.940
level at the end of the season.

02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:38.340
The queuing times for matches, despite a despite a healthier population to match make against

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:43.700
is a little bit slower because of the higher levels of communication and arrangement that

02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:44.340
has to happen.

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.820
You know, like you're going to go into the first game you get, but when there's so many

02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:53.700
more queuing at the same time, first come first serve, the line is longer.

02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:55.860
So it takes a little bit longer.

02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:59.060
Granted, that means I'm waiting like five or 10 more seconds.

02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:04.020
I'm not complaining for Rocket League capacity at all by comparison.

02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:12.820
But like I am in favor of optimizations because that is what it always will be.

02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:14.660
Like I said, don't stop.

02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.340
Don't stop attempting to improve.

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:16.980
Don't stop.

02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:19.060
Don't stop talking about it.

02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:23.700
Like I'm not the don't don't don't avoid chasing the solution.

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:26.020
Just don't be surprised by it.

02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:30.260
It's going to be quite a day and probably a lie when somebody says that they prevented

02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:32.660
these launch catastrophes.

02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:32.900
Yeah.

02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:38.420
And honestly, like I'm sure Yoshi P and his team are looking for that solution, but until

02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:41.060
they find it, they're going to have to keep doling out free game time.

02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:42.260
Let's be real.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:43.780
Let's call it like it is.

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:47.380
The frontline developers are doing all of that work.

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:52.900
And Yoshi P is, you know, finagling leadership.

02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:53.940
Leadership is leading.

02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:55.380
Frontline developers are doing.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:02.260
But yes, yes, the team is absolutely doing everything they can within reasonable human

02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:07.220
capacity and waking hours and energy and mind actually functioning appropriately.

02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:11.860
There is an element of this, though, where I think Yoshi P and really Square, and this

02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:15.220
would go outside the frontline developers, is really try to address this question.

02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:18.260
Where can we get the servers without the superconductors?

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:23.540
Like and I this is ridiculous, and I wouldn't say they actually do this, but can we pull

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:28.740
Final Fantasy 11 servers and make them 14 servers to handle this load?

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:29.780
Now, obviously, I would.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:33.380
And there's folks that play Final Fantasy 11 that would it would stab me if I said that

02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:35.060
with seriousness.

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:41.460
But, you know, can we allocate the resources from somewhere else, even if that's Tomb Raider

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:44.660
or some other game that is under Square's watch?

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.300
Can we allocate those resources to 14 somehow?

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.020
And I don't know.

02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:51.620
Yeah, again, but I think those are the types of questions they have to kind of look at.

02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:54.100
How can we get superconductors if we can't get new ones?

02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:59.860
But by the time they do that, social, you know, demand will probably drop enough that

02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:02.980
it will be less important.

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:03.700
Yeah.

02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:06.260
A lot of people will have canceled their subscriptions because they're sick of dealing

02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:07.140
with it.

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.220
But if the game is strong enough, they'll come back.

02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:09.720
We'll see.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:10.780
Yeah.

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.160
Jason, I really appreciate the perspective, of course.

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:15.080
Thank you for calling in.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:15.720
Appreciate it.

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.280
Anything else?

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:17.720
Anything else on your mind before we let you go?

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:18.840
No, sir.

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:19.960
Enjoy the rest of the night, everyone.

02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:23.180
All right.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.880
He cracked up for me a little bit there at the end.

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:30.040
I don't know if it was just my headphones or whatever, but yeah, a good goodbye and

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:30.840
farewell to Jason.

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.000
We'll hear him in the intro for next week.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.160
Let me peek back at the green room.

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:36.520
OK, I don't see anybody else in there.

02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:39.960
So I think we are about where we can wrap up.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.200
Loki, you said you had no last minute stories, right?

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:42.680
Not at all.

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:45.400
So then I think we can wrap up.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.600
So I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight, whether you were watching

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.760
us live on Twitch here on Sunday night, or you were checking us out on the podcast feed.

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:56.680
Appreciate you being here, checking us out and being with our show.

02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:00.040
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, help us spread the word because

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:03.560
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to participate

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:04.200
on air.

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:06.120
So please tell a friend about the show.

02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:11.720
A five-star review on a place like iTunes, a social share on Spotify, or wherever it

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:13.320
is that you listen to the show.

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:14.840
All of it goes a long way.

02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:15.640
Thank you very much.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.720
There is no shop currently.

02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.920
It's down for maintenance, but we're hoping to get that resolved relatively soon.

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.360
And that is, I think, it for me.

02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:26.840
Join our Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:29.240
Let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:34.360
I will start with DarkSakura as I know she's going to get ready for her post-party here

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:35.480
live tonight on Twitch.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.400
That's a good way to phrase it.

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:40.200
I don't really have anything.

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:43.880
I'm kind of in meh mode for right now.

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:49.960
So tune in, see what happens on stuff.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:53.000
Watch me break down live on the internet and everything's good.

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.800
We'll feel better and hang in there, DarkSakura.

02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:56.760
I feel all right.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:57.480
All right.

02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:58.040
Have a great night.

02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.080
We'll talk to you next week.

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:00.520
Later, Tater.

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:01.000
All right.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.280
And we will go to Loki.

02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.240
Your final thought tonight.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:09.240
My final thought is I hope our season two of NerdCraft gets started here pretty soon.

02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.560
It's just waiting on the Ram to arrive.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.640
It's a long wait.

02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:19.320
I'm just, I'm very much anticipating that getting started soon.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.600
And my final thought is I'm seeing a lot of positive changes from everything I've had

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.640
to change in my life with everything that happened a month ago.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:35.880
And yeah, my weight loss is starting to show up on the scale, which I like.

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:41.000
Not that you should let your weight define you, but the reality is I'm gonna have to

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.440
lose a little bit if I want to get around everything that's kind of happened lately.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.280
So it's very nice that things are moving in that positive direction.

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:49.320
I'm very happy about it.

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.600
So cross your fingers.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:52.040
I can keep it going for another couple months.

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.000
It'd be great.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.200
So hopefully someday a skinny legend again, like I was when I was 18.

02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.240
All right.

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:02.680
But being a little twunk is okay too.

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.440
I have a good night, everybody.

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.160
We'll see you next time for more Orange Launch Radio.

02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.520
We'll be back in seven days to talk about the game awards this week.

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:13.960
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of stuff and reveals we'll want to talk about.

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.320
Maybe some surprises, whether that be reveals or something someone does or says at the show.

02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.800
We'll talk about all that and whatever else comes up in the news.

02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:25.720
And I hope to God our lead story next week is Bobby Kotick's resignation.

02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:27.880
But if it's not, we'll keep asking for it.

02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:29.960
So we'll be here next week to do it all again.

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:30.680
Happy gaming.

02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:33.320
May the odds be ever in your favor.

02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:36.760
If you're battling the Q's and Final Fantasy 14, I hope you're having a lot of fun.

02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.040
Even if you're playing a classic like Minecraft or whatever it is you're playing.

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:40.840
Happy gaming.

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.320
Enjoy the holidays, everybody.

02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:45.560
We'll see you next week here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:46.360
