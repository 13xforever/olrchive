00:19.820 --> 00:23.440
you to play games away from your keyboard and outside of your home. Are you a fan of

00:23.440 --> 00:29.240

00:29.240 --> 00:32.720
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about at least

00:32.720 --> 00:36.120
two of these J-15 drops and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on

00:36.120 --> 00:37.800
the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.800 --> 00:45.880
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.880 --> 00:52.760
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode

00:52.760 --> 01:00.800
number 876 of our show for this July the 18th of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and

01:00.800 --> 01:05.740
I am joined with you live as I am every week by my co-hosts. First off, say hello to the

01:05.740 --> 01:08.000
one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh, hi.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Hi, how are you?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.400
I'm alright. How are you?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.840
Good. It was good to see you today.

01:13.840 --> 01:19.120
Yeah, it was good to see you. I was up too early, but y'all were worth it.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.960
So Pokemon GO Fest was this weekend. I guess I'll get into it now. So, you know, even though

01:24.960 --> 01:29.220
I know some of y'all say dead game, it did celebrate its five year anniversary and it

01:29.220 --> 01:33.960
does seem to have a lot of people still playing it and I'm one of them. And so those of you

01:33.960 --> 01:38.160
that listen to the show, if it's your first episode of OLR, hi, welcome. We talk about

01:38.160 --> 01:42.480
video games, but we talk about a lot of our lives and a lot of tangent trains and stuff

01:42.480 --> 01:46.720
too. So it happens sometimes. And one of the conductors of a lot of those tangent trains

01:46.720 --> 01:51.520
is our friend Shane, uh, that comes up on the show a lot. So, um, he was actually here

01:51.520 --> 01:57.640
this weekend because the purpose was to go play Pokemon GO in San Francisco. And you

01:57.640 --> 02:01.560
might wonder why on earth would somebody drive all the way from Idaho to San Francisco to

02:01.560 --> 02:07.360
play Pokemon GO? Well, number one, it's Shane. He does things like that. Number two, it was

02:07.360 --> 02:12.320
a nice, cool 65 degrees in San Francisco yesterday. Ask how hot it was.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.440
Nice to meet his hubby too.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.120
Yeah. Ask how hot it was here in Sacramento or Boise. It was not quite 97. Yeah. It was

02:19.120 --> 02:23.720
very hot yesterday. So, uh, it was, it was great. Yeah. So this morning, uh, before they

02:23.720 --> 02:30.440
set out back home, uh, we met up with dark Sakura for some, uh, crepes. It was good.

02:30.440 --> 02:36.120
So uh, yes. And I still have my leftovers. Yes. And the nice thing about that too is

02:36.120 --> 02:40.560
that if you notice for those, uh, listening or watching, I should say live on Twitch because

02:40.560 --> 02:45.160
we are a podcast. We've had a podcast for a very long time on our podcast feed at orange

02:45.160 --> 02:49.680
songs, radio.com. But, uh, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific

02:49.680 --> 02:54.440
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show at vog network, twitch.tv

02:54.440 --> 02:59.840
slash vog network. And if you are watching on Twitch, then when I hold up this little

02:59.840 --> 03:06.040
present that dark Sakura got for me, you can see what it is there. And maybe those of you

03:06.040 --> 03:10.380
that have been listening to show for a little bit know why this is really funny. Um, because

03:10.380 --> 03:17.280
I am holding up a figure of ketchup from animal crossing who was my BFF, uh, during the pandemic

03:17.280 --> 03:21.640
because I had no other friends besides Alan during the pandemic. And I bought this for

03:21.640 --> 03:26.560
you like last year. Yes. So you were finally able to give it to me today. Um, so that was

03:26.560 --> 03:31.960
great. Love that. So let me put her back up here next to me. It's a delicate balancing

03:31.960 --> 03:36.320
act there with sobble right next to her. Okay. There we go. Anyway, so yeah, it was

03:36.320 --> 03:41.120
good to see you today. Um, and I see in chat over there, uh, there's a lot of cute and

03:41.120 --> 03:46.360
so forth. Uh, darted CS says, OMG, ketchup plushie. I need one. Well, they're there,

03:46.360 --> 03:52.920
you know, the internet is a big place and there's lots of things on it. All right. You're

03:52.920 --> 03:57.600
welcome to DM me. One of those other things you will find on the internet is tech master

03:57.600 --> 04:03.360
Loki also joining us. Hi Loki. I'm here on the internet. You are on the internet. What

04:03.360 --> 04:06.960
you have quite a bit of internet playing behind you tonight. What in the world is that? It's

04:06.960 --> 04:12.120
all of the internet, the entire internet. It's it's Marvel versus Capcom three because

04:12.120 --> 04:17.440
we don't talk about infinite. That doesn't exist. You're right. What is that game? I've

04:17.440 --> 04:25.600
never heard of it. Okay. So I thought I was good. Marvel versus Capcom game. You think

04:25.600 --> 04:29.920
they'll do another one of those eventually? I hope it doesn't suck like infinite. Yeah,

04:29.920 --> 04:33.400
but there's always those rumors that they're going to cook up another one for the current

04:33.400 --> 04:38.600
generation of consoles. It got weird though. See like with infinite, like it got weird

04:38.600 --> 04:44.520
because it was a lot of the MCU characters that they brought in there. So like I prefer

04:44.520 --> 04:49.760
more some of these obscure characters in there. Like if they were like, for example, if they

04:49.760 --> 04:55.320
were going to do like a, well, Marvel would, they would never do a Capcom DC fighting game

04:55.320 --> 04:59.880
that would still be really awesome though. But like, you know, we want like star row

04:59.880 --> 05:06.580
in there or something like that for a DC Capcom fighting game. But like, like, I like a like

05:06.580 --> 05:12.080
Shuma graph and like all the, like even a lot of the Capcom characters are really awesome.

05:12.080 --> 05:17.040
Like I, I liked that mix of those characters. I think that's great. So I would like, I would

05:17.040 --> 05:23.720
like to see one more kind of akin to the Marvel versus Capcom three where it was still two

05:23.760 --> 05:30.760
D ish and stuff, and maybe not, not do what they did with infinite. Yeah. A Marvel versus

05:30.760 --> 05:36.240
DC fighting game is just never going to happen. It's literally see that it's literally as

05:36.240 --> 05:39.920
likely as a street fighter versus mortal combat. In fact, I would argue street fighter versus

05:39.920 --> 05:43.840
mortal combat is more likely because at least you're dealing with the studio's original

05:43.840 --> 05:50.040
creations with those. But I, I always, I always have appreciated the irony that the studio

05:50.080 --> 05:56.160
behind street fighter has Marvel and the studio behind mortal combat has DC injustice. Right.

05:56.160 --> 06:00.000
So I've, I've always appreciated that irony. That's a good, and I, I like the injustice

06:00.000 --> 06:05.480
games actually. That's probably, yeah. Ironically though, that is kind of just like how they

06:05.480 --> 06:09.480
work with their movies as well. Like more as Marvel and a lot of their movies are kind

06:09.480 --> 06:13.800
of tongue in cheek a little bit. Like some of them know how ridiculous they are and they

06:13.800 --> 06:20.360
kind of throw a bit of comedy in there. Whereas DC takes their movies way too serious and

06:20.360 --> 06:28.480
a little too dark sometimes, which is just like, um, so that's kind of like how they

06:28.480 --> 06:32.520
were treated a little bit with like their, you know, injustice games and stuff like that.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.640
It's, it's less funny and more like this is serious fighting. You know, it, it needs to

06:37.640 --> 06:42.440
be a little ridiculous. We need to go more suicide squad, like a suicide squad fighting

06:42.440 --> 06:46.360
game would be a great game, but like, those are some of the characters I'd like to see

06:46.360 --> 06:50.280
in a fighting game, something like that, you know, a bit more ridiculous. There was very

06:50.280 --> 06:54.320
recently a tweet by, I think it was Ed Boon or something. Maybe it was the studio itself

06:54.320 --> 07:01.160
that pretty much said mortal combat 11 is done. It we're now at the end of, uh, I don't

07:01.160 --> 07:05.960
want to say support, but end of a cycle basically for Mortal Kombat 11, meaning no more DLC,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.840
no more costumes, no more. There's no more to look forward to Mortal Kombat 11. It's

07:08.840 --> 07:12.920
all out there, but I bring that up because that makes it very obvious that nether realms

07:12.920 --> 07:19.480
move on to their next game, which we all assume is injustice three, but there's other directions

07:19.480 --> 07:24.840
they could go. Um, they haven't announced anything official yet, so who knows? Right.

07:24.840 --> 07:30.520
Um, going into our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, a pod culture says the injustice

07:30.520 --> 07:35.880
games are awesome. Uh, break man says injustice are good games. The justice justice league

07:35.920 --> 07:40.920
fighting game was so bad. Uh, break man also says, I want someone to make celebrity death

07:40.920 --> 07:45.560
match into a video game. I think it was, wasn't off. They did. It was on the PlayStation.

07:45.560 --> 07:49.980
Yeah. Early on. It wasn't very good. It's PlayStation or PlayStation two, but they did

07:49.980 --> 07:54.500
have a celebrity death match game. They did. And they, they had to get only certain celebrities

07:54.500 --> 07:58.960
that would release their likenesses. So they kinda, they were, they were really a scraping

07:58.960 --> 08:05.000
by on that, but yeah, it's, it's not a good game. So you forgetting it is okay. Um, and

08:05.040 --> 08:08.600
then tiger class pointing out, there is a teenage mutant Ninja turtles versus justice

08:08.600 --> 08:13.160
league fan game. And I was going to say, as far as the mortal combat and street fighter

08:13.160 --> 08:18.160
game collides go, um, that fan games, that's what you're going to get. Uh, what is that

08:18.160 --> 08:23.520
Mugen or what is that thing? Everybody like the fighting game multiverse. Yeah. That's,

08:23.520 --> 08:28.360
that's as good as you're going to get for that stuff is actually a really good emulator.

08:28.360 --> 08:34.160
And I would say Mugen probably is better than some of like the, what you'll get with some

08:34.160 --> 08:38.560
of these other games, as far as like Marvel versus Capcom infinite. I think they would,

08:38.560 --> 08:42.600
yes, I would think that they would treat their character like, cause you have fans making

08:42.600 --> 08:47.000
these characters. So I think they would treat them, you know, with a little bit more respect.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.640
Um, just, you know, never go up against any fast food mascots or anything like that. Cause

08:51.640 --> 08:55.040
you're just going to get destroyed though. And Superman has nothing on Ronald McDonald.

08:55.040 --> 09:01.480
So that's right. I remember that. Yikes. All right. Anyway, uh, let's talk about, uh, the

09:01.480 --> 09:06.480
news. There was a surprising amount of news this week. So, um, Jason very tongue in cheek

09:06.480 --> 09:09.960
there in the intro, there was talking about J 15 and we were kind of texting before the

09:09.960 --> 09:16.240
show and he said, you know, it's like E3, but on July 15th, it's J 15. And I'm like,

09:16.240 --> 09:21.240
honestly, I get it. Like there was a surprising amount of like just big news drops all in

09:21.240 --> 09:24.960
the same day this week. And I don't know what that's about. I don't know if that's just

09:24.960 --> 09:29.040
companies that didn't really participate in E3 kind of doing their own thing. If it's

09:29.040 --> 09:33.840
just, this is, you know, mid July seems like a good time as any to announce stuff is that

09:33.840 --> 09:38.480
as they, their project planning it out there, their Microsoft project document that tracks

09:38.480 --> 09:43.480
them from, you know, the, the concept to release, they just all landed on July 15th. But there

09:43.480 --> 09:48.360
was just a lot of stuff this week. Let's start off tonight talking about the big one. And

09:48.360 --> 09:51.280
I think a lot of people are talking about this and, uh, whether they're going to get

09:51.280 --> 09:55.960
one or not. Uh, Loki, please, what was the big unveil this week?

09:55.960 --> 10:01.840
So the big unveil this week was the steam deck. It is a, Oh, I have a stream deck right

10:01.840 --> 10:08.000
here. I'm ahead of the curve. Oh no, not the stream deck, a steam deck. So it is a handheld

10:08.000 --> 10:13.360
PC that kind of resembles a little bit of the form factor of a Nintendo switch. It's

10:13.360 --> 10:18.920
got, you know, built in, uh, joy six and it's got a, I think it was like a seven inch screen,

10:18.920 --> 10:24.960
um, with, uh, it's an OLED screen as well. So, uh, you've got that and then it's unpacking

10:24.960 --> 10:32.360
an AMD processor and APU. It's a Zen to our DNA to, uh, processor. And, uh, they've also

10:32.360 --> 10:36.600
got this cool, unique kind of a combination of thumbsticks. And then they add these like

10:36.600 --> 10:42.800
micro track pads underneath the thumbsticks, which is kind of cool. Um, so yeah, they've

10:42.800 --> 10:47.480
got that altogether. Uh, they're offering it with three different like storage sizes

10:47.480 --> 10:52.560
and stuff like that. So you can get, I think 64 words to, I think maybe half a terabyte

10:52.560 --> 11:00.460
or two 56, um, gigabytes, but yeah, it's, um, looks pretty cool. Uh, yes, we've, we've

11:00.460 --> 11:06.160
all heard that joke by now that valve has announced the, um, switch pro. So yes it is.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.840
But um, when it comes to competing with Nintendo, which is the instant comparison people want

11:10.840 --> 11:14.640
to make is that, Ooh, valve wants to throw down with the Nintendo switch. I'm kind of

11:14.640 --> 11:22.120
like act. I honestly don't see two different companies doing such different things. I think

11:22.120 --> 11:26.680
there's something to be said about the success of the switch leading valve down this road

11:26.680 --> 11:32.840
of could we maybe possibly, but let's also be real. This isn't the first time that a

11:32.840 --> 11:36.840
company has taken a look at doing like a portable PC like this, right?

11:36.840 --> 11:40.920
This is like this right here though. I'm going to tell you, I didn't mention this on Twitter,

11:40.920 --> 11:47.640
but I wanted to, this right here is going to be a fan. Well, hopefully a fantastic because

11:47.640 --> 11:52.240
I don't know how the, all the games are going to rent, but potentially a very fantastic

11:52.240 --> 11:59.240
game pass X cloud system, a portable X cloud system, because I mean, really all that's

11:59.240 --> 12:03.520
going to be streaming anyways, at least with X cloud. And I'm not really sure how much

12:03.520 --> 12:10.760
of the game pass stuff that this will be able to run, but I mean, it's pretty good at least

12:10.760 --> 12:14.960
potentially on paper. It could be good. Yeah. You know, um, we were having a little discussion

12:14.960 --> 12:19.800
on Twitter and my kind of initial reaction to it is, you know, in theory, it sounds really

12:19.800 --> 12:24.600
good. I want to see how it really performs. Like I need to get my hands on one personally

12:24.600 --> 12:29.480
to try it because I really want to see like, how well do those games perform on this device?

12:29.480 --> 12:33.660
And there's, I have a lot of questions in that regard. Um, I'm also not sure this is

12:33.660 --> 12:39.640
really for me because I don't play a lot like on my switch 95% of the time I'm playing docked,

12:39.640 --> 12:43.500
I'm not playing portable. I already have a docked PC. You know what I mean? So I'm not

12:43.500 --> 12:48.020
sure this is for me, but that's, that doesn't mean I'm a hater. Cause I think there's a

12:48.020 --> 12:55.260
lot of unique concepts here where I do have some concerns is that a lot of steam's comparable

12:55.260 --> 13:00.260
hardware is kind of flopped out the gate. I'm talking about steam machines. I'm talking

13:00.260 --> 13:04.820
about the steam link was a huge flop. Uh, the steam controller, it was actually giving

13:04.820 --> 13:10.900
those away. It was the controller was great, but it flopped. Yeah. And the steam controller

13:10.900 --> 13:15.060
was a bit odd. This is a little bit more traditional, like layout wise. They do have

13:15.060 --> 13:19.180
the additional track guys, which are kind of cool, um, that you can optionally use if

13:19.180 --> 13:24.340
you want. Um, the additional thumb or the additional buttons on the back of the controller

13:24.340 --> 13:28.020
are pretty cool. Uh, kind of like a lot of the pro controllers that they have out now,

13:28.020 --> 13:31.300
I think where this differs from, like say the steam link is the steam link was kind

13:31.300 --> 13:35.700
of ridiculous in the sense that you needed a PC running this. This is more of like, I'm

13:35.700 --> 13:40.820
going to set up, you know, this on my TV in the living room and play games from my

13:40.820 --> 13:47.260
PC on my TV in the living room. And not a lot of people really did that. Um, whereas

13:47.260 --> 13:52.980
this is its own thing. It's its own PC. And not only that, they're like, listen, it's

13:52.980 --> 13:56.700
meant for steam, but you can do whatever you want with it. It's a PC. I mean, if you want

13:56.700 --> 14:00.660
to put Epic games store on there, go right ahead. Go put GOG on there, go right ahead.

14:00.660 --> 14:04.900
You want to, you know, dump the steam OS on there and throw windows on there. Do whatever

14:04.900 --> 14:08.820
you want, like put emulators on it. We don't really care. I mean like that. It's just,

14:08.820 --> 14:13.060
it's a PC. Well, dark Sakura, you and I were chatting before the show that there's, there's

14:13.060 --> 14:19.340
some things this device can't do that people are finding, right? Yeah. So basically there

14:19.340 --> 14:26.860
are some, uh, games that aren't going to run at all, or if not, if they do run the not

14:26.860 --> 14:35.300
very well. Um, and the thing is, is, I mean, this is basically a Linux machine, right?

14:35.300 --> 14:42.620
Linux hasn't always had the best track record for video games either. Right. Um, they're

14:42.620 --> 14:48.900
using, um, this, uh, this feature that's called proton. Um, that's basically like a combination

14:48.900 --> 14:55.700
of wine and DXV, VK, sorry, that are basically emulators writers to play through the Linux

14:55.700 --> 15:02.220
ecosystem. So it prevents you from having the port, the game to Linux. It just makes

15:02.220 --> 15:06.320
it run. But of course it's far from flawless. And I mean, keep in mind, remember when I

15:06.320 --> 15:11.100
had my little net book that was running Linux and I used to play Ragnarok on it? Yeah. That

15:11.100 --> 15:16.060
was a pain in the ass to set up. I still use wine on my Mac. You were really big on that

15:16.060 --> 15:19.700
Linux mint for awhile. I had never heard of that until you came to this show and you were

15:19.700 --> 15:23.940
like, Oh, Linux, man, I love it. You should get a laptop and run it. It was really friendly.

15:23.940 --> 15:27.280
And the good thing about it is if, you know, your hard drive goes out on your machine,

15:27.280 --> 15:33.420
you can always plug in a flash drive with Linux on it and run it off that. Um, but anyway,

15:33.420 --> 15:42.820
um, there, uh, there's a group called proton, uh, that, uh, they basically track proton

15:42.820 --> 15:49.460
instances called proton DB. It says four of steam's 10 biggest games, uh, won't, won't

15:49.460 --> 15:55.600
work or they'll, they'll start up and crash or they'll play for a bit and fail or they

15:55.600 --> 16:01.420
just won't launch. Um, and those games are destiny to apex legends, rainbow six siege

16:01.420 --> 16:08.820
and, uh, uh, uh, player in a battleground. Um, and the direct quote is that they are

16:08.820 --> 16:14.980
borked. Um, um, go ahead. There's a good chat comment though, on all of these same lines.

16:14.980 --> 16:21.340
Well, the, according to the reports, it happens because the anti cheat systems in those games

16:21.340 --> 16:28.140
don't play well with photon. And so they're getting, um, instantly booted for multiplayer

16:28.140 --> 16:35.300
servers. So, and of course valve is saying, um, we're vastly improving protons game compatibility,

16:35.300 --> 16:39.900
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So that would that impact dead by daylight? Cause I know

16:39.900 --> 16:45.940
that's the game you'd want to play on this. Uh, well, yes, along those same lines. So

16:45.940 --> 16:49.620
we have a comment here from chief tattooed officer, which I don't think I've seen. Uh,

16:49.620 --> 16:53.440
so welcome, uh, in chat who says I'm a Linux user, so I'm pretty familiar with what will

16:53.440 --> 16:59.180
and won't run. The biggest issues are the two anti-cheat vendors, battle eye and EAC.

16:59.180 --> 17:03.180
So, and I bet, I bet Danuvo was on that list too. Let's just put them on the list cause

17:03.180 --> 17:07.920
I'm sure it's screwing everything up as well. Uh, a chief tattooed officer continues valve

17:07.920 --> 17:11.840
is working with battle eye and EAC to try to get them to support proton, but nobody's

17:11.840 --> 17:16.160
sure if it'll be out by the time it releases. So, and those, you know, those games you named,

17:16.160 --> 17:22.120
those are all pretty big deals there, at least as far as like, you know, the, the big, uh,

17:22.120 --> 17:26.480
multiplayer bonanza type of games. So you can assume any of those big multiplayer bonanza

17:26.480 --> 17:30.520
games are gonna have some type of anti-cheat in it. And that's the thing. Yeah, they've

17:30.520 --> 17:35.920
got to work out. Um, that all being said, you know, again, I said this thing isn't for

17:35.920 --> 17:41.300
me, but I have friends who plunked down that five bucks in a heartbeat because, you know,

17:41.300 --> 17:45.880
they're on transit an hour a day, you know, they, their lives are just configured differently

17:45.880 --> 17:52.400
where they do have more time for portable gaming. And honestly, yeah, if that were me,

17:52.400 --> 17:58.480
hell yeah, to be able to play my PC games on the go, that would be incredible. Um, it's

17:58.480 --> 18:03.600
like, and in that way, sorry, in that way, it compliments the switch to me. It's kind

18:03.600 --> 18:07.760
of like why you own a switch and a X-Box or in a place, a PlayStation or whatever in

18:07.760 --> 18:12.400
the first place is that you're not going to get Nintendo games on a steam deck, but there's

18:12.400 --> 18:15.520
a lot of stuff on a steam deck. You're not going to get on the switch. Anyway, sorry,

18:15.520 --> 18:20.940
Jamie. I'm wondering that since it's basically running, um, in Linux, if there's not going

18:20.940 --> 18:28.040
to be like an OS port for that build, you know, that I could install on a partition

18:28.040 --> 18:37.520
somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. You know, um, or if I would be able to, I guess like window link

18:37.520 --> 18:45.240
so that I could, you know, it's just different things. It makes me think that the virtualizers

18:45.240 --> 18:53.080
that are being used once they are up to, up to par, if I would be able to run something

18:53.080 --> 19:00.600
like that on my Mac, because Mac and Linux are both built on Unix and therefore are

19:00.600 --> 19:05.500
basically cousins of each other by operating system. You can probably just partition and

19:05.500 --> 19:11.560
run dual operating systems. You can't, not on an M1 Mac. No, I'm talking about on the

19:11.560 --> 19:18.180
steam link. On the steam link? Still wouldn't suit my purposes. Well, but, um, we, we were

19:18.180 --> 19:21.640
talking, um, earlier in the week after this was announced and you, you kind of thought

19:21.640 --> 19:25.760
that, you know, I, I was very much of the mindset, like, ah, I got to wait until I get

19:25.760 --> 19:29.760
my hands on one myself to make the use case scenario. I'm not going to go in, um, sight

19:29.760 --> 19:34.640
unseen on this, but I think it's interesting. And so I want to see more, but I want to actually

19:34.640 --> 19:39.640
see one, but dark soccer, you weren't kind of like, Hmm, Hmm. I can see, Hmm. You know,

19:39.640 --> 19:43.360
at least, you know, I don't know if that's still your mindset when it comes to, if you

19:43.360 --> 19:50.320
personally might get one of these or not, but, um, my perspective on it shifted a little

19:50.320 --> 19:59.640
bit when, um, this, uh, lovely motherboard arrived, wink, wink, you know who you are.

19:59.640 --> 20:06.760
Um, so I'm actually still considering, um, rebuilding my, um, my piece. I mean, my PC

20:06.760 --> 20:14.280
works. It just doesn't work well. Um, so I'm going to gut it, rebuild it, um, and probably

20:14.280 --> 20:22.280
hook it on a KVM switch so that I can run what I need to, to stream off of that one.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.360
Like if I want to play Mass Effect, but already Mass Effect is starting to work on windows

20:26.360 --> 20:32.640
arm. So I might not need to do much with that PC right now. I'm still having the best time

20:32.640 --> 20:36.160
playing dead by daylight on stadia. It would just be nice to be able to change my name

20:36.160 --> 20:42.400
at random. Um, chief tattooed officer continues in chat. The biggest thing I think is if someone

20:42.400 --> 20:47.080
wants to do a triple a multiplayer game, uh, like apex anti cheat is going to kill

20:47.080 --> 20:52.080
that market and I don't personally think it'll be fixed. I agree with you on the first half.

20:52.080 --> 20:56.600
I'm not sure I completely agree with you on the second half. Like I, I get that train

20:56.600 --> 21:02.320
of thought, but I'm also of the mindset where it's like if this thing sells cuckoo bananas

21:02.320 --> 21:06.040
and let's say tons of people want to pick up the steam deck and tons of them end up

21:06.040 --> 21:12.280
selling, then you know what? If the companies want to sell their games on steam for the,

21:12.280 --> 21:16.160
you know, to be played on these things, they're going to find a way to make it work and they

21:16.160 --> 21:19.640
may push back with the anti cheat companies. I, that's not something that's going to happen

21:19.640 --> 21:24.540
overnight and I think that is, that is definitely where I agree in this concept is that that's

21:24.540 --> 21:29.840
going to take time and I think steam deck perspective owners should be well aware to

21:29.840 --> 21:35.240
play things like apex, et cetera. You could be talking a couple of years before all that

21:35.240 --> 21:41.200
shit is sorted out for the record. Yeah. Mass Effect legendary edition does play in proton

21:41.240 --> 21:47.040
6.8 g two. Huh? How about that? I went looking it up so I, because I was still going to see

21:47.040 --> 21:53.720
if I could play it through wine and uh, it says that it plays in proton. So we'll see.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.400
Um, Zen monkey 11 and chat says valve sucks at mass production, so they'll never have

21:57.400 --> 22:01.720
enough of them. Yeah. I was looking on the, it said the preorder, like if I wanted one

22:01.720 --> 22:06.280
is already out to quarter two of 2022. So it's, you know, it's going to be awhile if

22:06.280 --> 22:10.960
I decide if this is for me or not and that's okay. Um, how about the way they all set that

22:10.960 --> 22:15.240
up though? Because I've been seeing a lot of articles about, Oh, there's already people

22:15.240 --> 22:20.360
on eBay that are trying to scout these things for a shit ton of money. I feel like as far

22:20.360 --> 22:25.220
as how they did the preorder, like everything again. Yeah. Like how you have to have an

22:25.220 --> 22:30.280
existing account, how they charged you $5 upfront and limited you to one. I thought

22:30.280 --> 22:35.440
that was a pretty intelligent way to do it. Um, now granted, I understand the system really

22:35.440 --> 22:39.040
shit the bed as everybody was trying to get in there. One of my friends said he was on

22:39.040 --> 22:43.440
that reloading screen for like nine hours before it finally went through. Like it was

22:43.440 --> 22:49.040
crazy. Um, but so that part could have been better as you know, but maybe that also speaks

22:49.040 --> 22:54.780
to valve really underestimated the demand for this thing. Um, so that, that could be

22:54.780 --> 23:00.000
very interesting in that regard, but I, you know, of course there's going to be, you know,

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
scalpers and, and opportunities, Caesars that sneak through. Um, and so that's where the

23:05.000 --> 23:11.200
eBay stuff comes from. But you know, I do like that you can still go and get one on

23:11.200 --> 23:17.720
steam at the retail price. You just will be waiting a little bit. I, I don't hate that.

23:17.720 --> 23:23.200
I think that's, I wish they did graphics cards that way. I wish they did Nintendo Amiibo

23:23.200 --> 23:27.120
that way. There's a lot of things I wish they would do that way so that, you know, if I'm

23:27.120 --> 23:31.040
willing to wait, at least I'll get one of it. I wish PS fives have been done that way,

23:31.040 --> 23:38.620
quite frankly. So I don't, I can't really knock what steam is doing outside of, okay,

23:38.620 --> 23:44.000
it shit the bed the day they unveiled it. But you know, I, I'm sure you could prepare

23:44.000 --> 23:48.740
for worst case scenario and it still is somehow even worse. So I'm going to give them a tiny

23:48.740 --> 23:51.400
bit of slack on that. Uh, Loki, I know you're trying to chime in.

23:51.400 --> 23:58.360
No, not really. I mean, I, I didn't end up bidding or not bidding, uh, going in for a

23:58.360 --> 24:03.560
pre-order on one, just because I don't know what I'd even run on it. I mean, like I've

24:03.560 --> 24:07.680
got a PC that I pretty much use all the time. It would just be like, I guess, playing games

24:07.680 --> 24:14.800
of the living room, which is like 10 feet away. Um, it would probably just be Minecraft.

24:14.800 --> 24:21.440
So like, I don't know, like, I don't know, like why it would spend $600 for another device

24:21.440 --> 24:27.600
to play Minecraft. Not as good as my computer. This, um, I don't know. I mean, I have a huge

24:27.600 --> 24:31.900
library of games. I could definitely play on it. It's just, I thought about like my

24:31.900 --> 24:37.540
son's looking for a computer, but like, yeah, I just, I I'd rather get like a laptop or

24:37.540 --> 24:38.880
something for that kind of money.

24:38.880 --> 24:44.480
Hmm. Uh, did your MS and chat points out steam deck listings have been pulled from eBay due

24:44.480 --> 24:48.240
to the fact that they violated the TOS. Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Follow up. That's

24:48.240 --> 24:53.680
interesting. Uh, meanwhile, Metroid dream listings are still up. Well, it's like whack-a-mole.

24:53.680 --> 24:58.140
You knock them down and they come right back up. So it's, it's that, uh, as Joe and Hunter

24:58.140 --> 25:01.120
Matt says, I thought it was interesting that Gabe Newell said his biggest issue with the

25:01.120 --> 25:05.680
steam deck is the price. They really wanted it to be a consumer friendly price, but they

25:05.680 --> 25:09.920
wanted to provide a good amount of performance for this, that the consumer will enjoy. And

25:09.920 --> 25:14.120
is it par with current high powered tablets and gaming devices, which I respect. Yeah.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.920
I think they did all right with the price, you know, maybe they were, I think they did

25:17.920 --> 25:22.240
fine with the price. They might've wanted to be a little more competitive. Um, you can't

25:22.240 --> 25:27.360
have it the same price as like a Nintendo switch and expect a performance that it has

25:27.360 --> 25:33.520
in there. Like you just can't have both worlds there. You have to have, you know, what it's,

25:33.520 --> 25:37.920
it's got to cost what it's going to cost. I mean, I think the timing though, that the

25:37.920 --> 25:42.400
announce was great. It's like you get this announcement about the Nintendo switch OLED.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.680
Everyone's disappointed and it's like, Oh, Hey, well, we got this. If you're interested

25:45.680 --> 25:50.920
in something a little more powerful. Um, so that timing was great, but I really think

25:50.920 --> 25:54.400
that was coincidental though. I don't think valve could have planned that. That may have

25:54.400 --> 26:00.040
been, um, it had to be because they, they were preparing their system, their backend

26:00.040 --> 26:06.720
for something, even if, again, it didn't hold up, they had to prepare it for this, you know,

26:06.720 --> 26:11.560
so I, this isn't something where Gabe is sitting in his evil lair at the top of valve headquarters

26:11.560 --> 26:18.320
going, I see the Nintendo pre-orders were a failure. What? Said scratching off all the

26:18.320 --> 26:22.720
threes on the calendar. Exactly. Like, I, I just don't think that's how it played out.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.800
I think it was a bit coincidental in that regard. So, um, yeah. And I said, you want

26:27.800 --> 26:31.640
her, Matt also points out, especially in the chip shortage era we're in. I wonder how many

26:31.640 --> 26:37.480
people are buying these machines to farm a doge coin and Bitcoin and all that stuff.

26:37.480 --> 26:44.260
There's no GPU. I mean, there's an APU, but there's no like there's it. That would not

26:44.260 --> 26:50.540
be a very good use of that. Uh, all right. Uh, any other comments on the steam deck before

26:50.540 --> 26:55.100
we move on with the show? I it's, it's, it's interesting. Oh, I actually, there was one

26:55.100 --> 26:58.500
of the little thing I want to get into because it is interesting to see valve. Like it's

26:58.500 --> 27:05.100
like, oh, there's what about valves been up to outside of VR. So here's that steam deck.

27:05.100 --> 27:10.200
And I still kind of firmly believe this point is that if valve really wanted to push that

27:10.200 --> 27:15.800
steam deck one step further, I really think they should have announced a game with it.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.620
I think they really should have announced like that new valve product. That's going

27:19.620 --> 27:23.040
to be playable on the steam deck. And I'm not saying they have to make it exclusive

27:23.040 --> 27:27.080
to the steam deck. I think that would have pissed a lot of people off, but just imagine

27:27.080 --> 27:34.200
the power of the first portal three, I'm completely making shit up. We all know valve is allergic

27:34.200 --> 27:40.600
to three. Hear me out here. Imagine the power of the first portal three screenshots being

27:40.600 --> 27:46.340
in the context of a steam deck and what that would do for demand. That would sell so many

27:46.340 --> 27:53.040
of them. Exactly. So I'm kind of shocked valve didn't take that easy opportunity because

27:53.040 --> 27:56.240
again, and I guess portal three is one of those things, you know, again, obviously I

27:56.240 --> 28:01.880
love portal. I want to see that series continue. Portal is also something that I truly believe

28:01.880 --> 28:07.040
is impossible in VR and should not happen in VR. So it's not something where I'm like,

28:07.040 --> 28:12.640
I still want it to happen. I know you do, but I, I think realistically it shouldn't.

28:12.640 --> 28:17.360
So I don't know. Like, like you have to try some of the like more, like there's a lot

28:17.360 --> 28:21.640
of VR games that like where you think like an FPS or something like that wouldn't work,

28:21.640 --> 28:28.040
but they do like, I don't know. But I think the steam deck would have been a great place

28:28.040 --> 28:32.020
for a portal three type of thing. And again, I'm not saying make it exclusive. I don't,

28:32.020 --> 28:35.340
and I don't think Val's interested in going down that route, but again, I'm just saying

28:35.340 --> 28:41.640
the power of the messaging. Imagine that, you know, it's, it's like how steam launched

28:41.640 --> 28:46.160
alongside half-life two. Now granted that pissed a lot of people off at the time, but

28:46.160 --> 28:51.420
people have generally gotten used to it. So there are, and portal two was kind of coupled

28:51.420 --> 28:57.100
with that thing where steam was on PlayStation. Like a lot of people forgot that was a thing

28:57.100 --> 29:02.460
that happened is that your steam account kind of ran on PlayStation, but it kind of

29:02.460 --> 29:07.060
quickly disappeared, you know, um, that a whole thing, that whole mess got screwed by

29:07.060 --> 29:11.740
what the PlayStation hack had happened right around that same time. And so a lot of that

29:11.740 --> 29:18.240
got lost. So, um, yeah, so I just, I, I really think that was a missed opportunity by valve.

29:18.240 --> 29:25.600
And I'm just curious, like, where's the software, although there was half-life Alex, which is

29:25.600 --> 29:30.800
as many folks have pointed out that that is half-life three. It's just, they weren't

29:30.800 --> 29:36.820
willing to put the number three next to VR only. And I understand and respect that decision,

29:36.820 --> 29:41.800
but for all intents and purposes, half-life Alex is half-life three. Um, and they put

29:41.800 --> 29:46.760
that with the VR. So I'm just, again, I'm just kind of surprised we're not seeing software,

29:46.760 --> 29:52.160
you know, especially because it has been such a dry well out of valve in the software department.

29:52.160 --> 29:57.520
So of course then people are going to say, but the card game, but Dota 2, but it's kind

29:57.520 --> 30:05.340
of like, but the stuff, that stuff I'm interested in. So, all right. That was the only other

30:05.340 --> 30:10.400
thought I wanted to get out was, you know, what about the software and you know, what

30:10.400 --> 30:16.200
else is valve working on over there? But it is nice to at least see this. Yeah. All right.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.400
Let's get into how was our gaming weeks? What have we been playing portal this week or what

30:20.440 --> 30:25.920
have we been playing? Let's get into our gaming weeks and we'll start with dark Sakura. Um,

30:25.920 --> 30:31.600
dead by daylight and word scapes and my world cup soccer is back home. So I played world

30:31.600 --> 30:38.280
cup soccer. The pinball machine. Yes. Nice. Like there's no other world cup soccer that's

30:38.280 --> 30:41.920
worth talking about. I still want to come over and play pinball sometime. It's been

30:41.920 --> 30:47.640
too long. Okay. I need to do that. Hey, I should be, well, I'm streaming tomorrow night,

30:47.720 --> 30:50.760
but if you want to play pinball while I'm streaming, feel free. We'll figure it out.

30:50.760 --> 30:55.600
We'll figure it out. So yeah. Um, yeah. And I'm going to be gone this weekend, but we'll,

30:55.600 --> 31:01.280
we'll figure out a weeknight or something. Have a play date. It'll be fun. Um, all right.

31:01.280 --> 31:07.280
Uh, so Loki, how was your gaming week? Uh, it's all Minecraft. That's what it was. No,

31:07.280 --> 31:12.400
it's still working on issues with the service. Still trying to get my latest episode out. Um,

31:12.880 --> 31:19.360
I've been going through just, um, I have to change and pivot a little bit on what I want to do for

31:19.360 --> 31:27.920
content wise, just because of the lack of people on the server. And I've been exploring options

31:27.920 --> 31:33.760
at the end of the season where I may be going. And, uh, but in the meantime though, I want to

31:33.760 --> 31:41.920
get into more, um, complex things with my content. And so that's kind of slowed things down a little

31:41.920 --> 31:48.080
bit, unfortunately, I'm still going through and also hardware issues because since everything

31:48.080 --> 31:55.120
updated the one 17 one and one 17, um, a lot of the mod makers out there, especially the stuff

31:55.120 --> 32:00.080
that has to do with performance, like off the fine and all those they're kinda, it takes time

32:00.080 --> 32:05.600
to get that all updated. And so things haven't been running as great, but I finally Iris updated

32:05.600 --> 32:09.520
and I was able to update to that. And so now I have shaders and it looks nice and everything,

32:09.520 --> 32:15.680
but it doesn't play nice with, um, replay mod, which is what I use. And so if I want to render

32:15.680 --> 32:24.000
with shaders, it's extremely slow. Like I, it took normally it takes about like 10, 15 minutes

32:24.000 --> 32:31.040
to render out a, a time-lapse or whatever of, you know, several hours, um, obviously sped up,

32:31.040 --> 32:36.960
but it took like two hours to render it out instead because just off the fine is just garbage

32:36.960 --> 32:44.640
right now. Um, so it, I don't know, we had more people leave the server, so that was fun. Um,

32:44.640 --> 32:50.720
so I'm taking over some shops, I think. So that'll be coming soon, but there's to kind of

32:50.720 --> 32:54.720
not spoil it too much. Cause I only tease at the end or I'm planning to tease at the end of this

32:54.720 --> 33:00.240
next episode. Um, I think my content is going to get a little bit more into like the role-play

33:00.240 --> 33:04.640
type of scenario. So going to be introducing like a storyline that goes along with everything

33:04.640 --> 33:10.560
because I don't have people to interact with on the server. Like everyone's on vacation and it

33:10.560 --> 33:14.720
like literally the last two weeks, it's been just myself on there for a lot of it.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.720
Um, there's some people coming back and playing and stuff, but I never interact with these people

33:19.600 --> 33:24.640
at any point. They're like AF Kane or something like that. So I need to become creative and figure

33:24.640 --> 33:28.480
something out. So I want to get into, um, more of a storyline things. I think that'll be more

33:28.480 --> 33:36.880
engaging with my audience. And then also, uh, animation would be kind of cool. I don't know

33:36.880 --> 33:41.120
how come, how hard that's going to be. So I, that's something I need to explore as well,

33:41.120 --> 33:46.480
which will also take some time. Um, but I do have some ideas of content I'm going to be working on.

33:46.480 --> 33:52.240
I really am trying to get this last episode out. It just took so long to like build everything in

33:52.240 --> 33:56.960
over the last couple of weeks that that's all the content is just a time-lapse of that. And

33:56.960 --> 34:01.440
so I need to kind of build it up a little bit for this episode to come out, but I'm trying to

34:01.440 --> 34:07.520
get it down to one week at, you know, per episode, but it's, it's been about two weeks now and that's

34:07.520 --> 34:13.760
frustrating because I want it to be quicker, but I'm figuring out new ways to advertise and stuff

34:13.760 --> 34:19.120
like that. New places to kind of promote myself. So it's just been all content creation stuff,

34:19.120 --> 34:23.600
really. That's what I've been doing this week, but, um, mainly Minecraft. I haven't really

34:23.600 --> 34:29.120
been playing anything else. Got my kids, um, the new Zelda game, but, uh, yeah, I really want to

34:29.120 --> 34:33.440
check that out. That's that's what all my friends are doing right now. It's all like my social media

34:33.440 --> 34:38.240
feeds are all Skyward sword. And I'm sorry to say that that was not a part of my week this week,

34:38.240 --> 34:42.640
but maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll jump into it next week, but I kind of, I want to finish

34:42.640 --> 34:48.640
the koozas still. So I don't know. Yeah. I need to go and play games other than Minecraft at some

34:48.640 --> 34:54.480
point, but like, um, that's all right. I know I like it. I like what I'm doing, but like,

34:54.480 --> 34:59.920
it is frustrating. YouTube's are in some ways harder than Twitch because it's not just

34:59.920 --> 35:05.680
broadcasting it live. It's recording it. Then you got to go back and edit it. That's the thing.

35:06.480 --> 35:11.440
And the problem with the stuff I'm, I'm still over scoping everything again. So like,

35:11.440 --> 35:16.720
I look at like, I kind of compare myself to a lot of like what the Hermitcraft folks are doing. So

35:16.720 --> 35:22.800
like their projects aren't nearly as the size that I'm doing. Like the, the build I just did

35:22.800 --> 35:28.080
this week was like something that they would have taken four to six episodes to probably complete,

35:28.080 --> 35:33.280
or, you know, worked on it a little bit at a time. Like it is too large, but I needed it to

35:33.280 --> 35:38.160
be large because I need to get exposure and I need to do grand things in order to get everybody's

35:38.160 --> 35:41.920
attention. And that's the problem is I'm pushing myself too hard to do that. So because all my

35:41.920 --> 35:48.000
builds are really huge and really complex and the redstone's only going to get more complex.

35:48.560 --> 35:53.760
So it's, it's hard to cram that all in there. Plus also like these guys are doing it full time.

35:53.760 --> 35:59.760
Like I, I I'm restricted with the amount of time I can work on it. And so that's also another thing

35:59.760 --> 36:04.960
that sets me back. So I can't, can't do all that. Now, if I just did live stream stuff, that works

36:04.960 --> 36:09.280
for some things. And I know the type of scenarios that I could live stream and start getting into

36:09.280 --> 36:16.000
that as well, but it's just, I just, I, I can't really do that right now. So I'm just gonna keep

36:16.000 --> 36:21.680
working at it. All right. Going to our chat, cause sometimes over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

36:21.680 --> 36:26.960
when we are broadcasting our recording on Sunday nights, some of you like to share your gaming

36:26.960 --> 36:32.160
weeks. And I see Black and Pat has responded, which by the way, do me a favor, click on Black

36:32.160 --> 36:36.320
and Pat, and please ensure that you are following that channel. Thank you very much. Black and Pat

36:36.320 --> 36:40.480
says I've been playing Hella Slime Rancher. See, that's another one of those games. And I do,

36:40.480 --> 36:44.320
I have watched people play that on Twitch and I'm like, oh, I should play this. This looks fun.

36:44.320 --> 36:49.200
And then I just, oh, but shiny something else gets my, oh, I need to grind in Dead by Daylight

36:49.200 --> 36:55.440
or whatever it is. It's something else. I know I do. I know I have it. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So

36:56.080 --> 37:01.520
anyway, um, that's Joan Hunter Matt lending some video editing expertise here. When making a video,

37:01.520 --> 37:06.080
you have to produce a ton of footage to edit down to video that is consumable. 15 minute video,

37:06.080 --> 37:10.560
you need over an hour of footage to work with video editing is a daunting thing. Yeah, no,

37:10.560 --> 37:14.320
that's the, that's the problem. I have too much footage. Like, and I get that you have to edit it

37:14.320 --> 37:19.280
down. It's easier if there is dialogue because like, for example, when like an average, like,

37:19.280 --> 37:23.520
you know, once again, I'm comparing myself to hermitcraft, um, their videos they have, they,

37:24.160 --> 37:28.400
they consider a lot is when they have like two hours worth of dialogue and footage.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.600
I'm cutting down like 10 to 20 hours worth of footage.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.080
Oh no. Too much footage.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.920
That's, that's what you've got to work on for sure.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.720
You don't even want to see what it takes to go into my Twitch videos.

37:41.680 --> 37:46.480
I save a clip. I add an intro and outro and put my own music on it and done.

37:46.480 --> 37:51.520
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I get that. And there's, and there's some folks that that's what they do is

37:51.520 --> 37:57.360
they just broadcast on Twitch and then dump their stuff into YouTube and that works for them. That's

37:57.360 --> 37:59.760
fine. Uh, I can't do that. I do some editing.

38:01.760 --> 38:06.160
I, I don't, I hardly ever do editing. It's, it's also a difference between us,

38:06.160 --> 38:10.960
even in Bobby Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, his shows go up later in the week because he

38:10.960 --> 38:16.400
likes to edit, to take out some of his pauses and um's and ah's and things that happen that are

38:16.400 --> 38:21.520
live. And I usually have this show up later in the night on Sunday. Why? Because I'm like,

38:21.520 --> 38:27.440
it's, it warts and all, here it is. Like I, it's just, it is, it's a, it feels like a live

38:27.440 --> 38:33.280
presentation, but it's recorded for the podcast. And, uh, it's just, it's just differences in what

38:33.280 --> 38:38.720
we're doing, but it takes, it takes a lot to edit where, where editing for me is more cropping,

38:38.720 --> 38:42.640
you know, it's like, okay, take out the stuff before the intro, take everything out after the

38:42.640 --> 38:49.360
outro, uh, in, in extreme circumstances, bleep something where I accidentally like

38:49.360 --> 38:52.960
dock somebody by saying their last name. Like I know that happened once on the show

38:53.680 --> 38:58.880
weeks ago. I was, I was talking about a grandpa and I said his real name because a lot of us call

38:58.880 --> 39:03.840
him by his last name. So I bleeped it. I took it out. You know, that's very, very rare that I will

39:03.840 --> 39:08.240
do that, but for those types of circumstances, yes, I will edit. But, um, yeah, it takes,

39:08.240 --> 39:14.160
it takes a big, uh, thing to get me to edit the show. I would reckon though that using my Twitch

39:14.240 --> 39:19.520
clips means I've already edited. Yeah. That is the nice thing about Twitch too,

39:19.520 --> 39:24.720
is that you can kind of like stamp where the good stuff was and then go back and like do the clips.

39:24.720 --> 39:28.400
The highlight feature has actually been really helpful because then that saves me from having

39:28.400 --> 39:34.960
to download the entire VOD. Yeah. And then I can save just what I want to, but then again,

39:34.960 --> 39:39.360
you know, you could, um, what are you capturing through? Are you using OBS?

39:40.320 --> 39:46.480
Yeah, I'm using Streamlabs OBS. So it Yuck. Slobs is terrible.

39:47.200 --> 39:52.240
I have no problem with it. It works just fine for what I'm doing. Um, so it's, it's really,

39:52.240 --> 39:58.640
a lot of it is time lapses take a lot. Cause I have to replay mod. I have to go back and I have

39:58.640 --> 40:04.240
to, uh, basically pick the camera path and, and do all the adjustments through there. So it's,

40:04.240 --> 40:10.240
it's cutting that out. And because it took so long to build what I built, I have,

40:11.280 --> 40:16.960
it's about a week's worth of time-lapse to go through. So I've gone through two of the two,

40:16.960 --> 40:22.720
like two or three hours worth of clips right now to time-lapse and, and I have to time-lapse the

40:22.720 --> 40:28.000
whole thing and do the camera sweeps and stuff like that. Um, even though I'm going to cut that

40:28.000 --> 40:33.200
down significantly, that's, you know, the, what ends up being probably an hour. Cause it's,

40:33.200 --> 40:38.720
it's an eight time speed. So an hour worth of clips is going to be down to like three minutes,

40:38.720 --> 40:43.360
but I still have to process the whole thing to get it down to that three minutes. And it's just

40:43.360 --> 40:49.840
taking a long time. So plus now that I'm going to be doing some other things involved, creating some

40:49.840 --> 40:54.960
data packs and actual mods for Minecraft as well, in order to tell the story that I'm going to be

40:54.960 --> 41:01.760
telling. So there's other work that's going into it now too. All right. Um, by the way,

41:01.760 --> 41:06.080
this whole talk about streaming and recording at the same time, that's actually powering OLR

41:06.080 --> 41:10.880
right now. So of course we're streaming to Twitch, but then there is a local recording of the movie

41:10.880 --> 41:16.080
made, um, on the Mac mini. Um, I don't know if everybody knows, but the video and the Twitch

41:16.080 --> 41:21.760
stuff is all powered by Mac mini. So we, uh, uh, uh, end up saving the local recording there. We

41:21.760 --> 41:26.080
pass it through garage band and that will cause garage band will actually read movies and strip

41:26.080 --> 41:30.560
out that audio and make the MP3. And that's basically. You and I need to sit down so I can

41:30.560 --> 41:35.120
give you the crash course in logic. Well, I mean, but for, again, I'm cropping, not editing for

41:35.120 --> 41:39.760
what I'm doing. I don't need the Primo materials. You know, I could, I could use audacity if that

41:39.760 --> 41:43.920
was the thing, you know, so it's, it's good enough, but yeah, if we ever did want to get fancier,

41:43.920 --> 41:51.440
sure. But, um, I don't know if I have time to get fancier. All right. There's some other things that

41:52.400 --> 41:57.120
we'll talk offline. Fair enough. All right. My gaming week, other stuff. Um, so let's see for

41:57.120 --> 42:01.920
my gaming week. So I talked a little bit about Pokemon go. So Pokemon go Fest was this weekend

42:01.920 --> 42:06.000
and it was to celebrate the five-year anniversary of the game. And they did a whole thing where the

42:06.000 --> 42:12.720
virtual it's all virtual. So all that talk about, you know, the Chicago, uh, festival and how

42:12.720 --> 42:17.760
everything clogged the network there that, that, that has been gone for two years now because of

42:17.760 --> 42:22.720
the pandemic. So last year, and now this year were Pokemon go Fest everywhere. They cut the

42:22.720 --> 42:27.600
price way down this year. It was $5 in honor of the fifth anniversary. I also kind of think

42:28.320 --> 42:32.640
they heard some of the feedback last year that it wasn't really justified what they were charging

42:32.640 --> 42:38.240
last year. And I think $5 was a little more appropriate for this year. Um, and, uh, yeah,

42:38.240 --> 42:43.920
there were lots of different types of spawns. You got a couple things like sock and chatot that

42:43.920 --> 42:47.600
don't usually spawn in this part of the world that you were able to catch. They released some

42:47.600 --> 42:52.960
new shinies. Um, today was all about raids. And if you're newer to the game, it was a really

42:52.960 --> 42:56.560
good chance to catch up on a lot of legendaries you may have missed because they had put out

42:56.560 --> 43:01.360
literally every legendary was available today. If you were able to find it, um, just not the

43:01.360 --> 43:05.520
mythical stuff, there is a difference there. Um, but there was a lot like, apparently I never got

43:05.520 --> 43:11.040
a Zekrom, uh, for whatever reason, I just missed that. So I got one today thanks to, uh, the day

43:11.040 --> 43:16.720
two. So it was, it was fine. It was a fun event. I honestly, it was just more about the people.

43:16.720 --> 43:23.120
So we went out to San Francisco, as I mentioned, and we, uh, to avoid crazy traffic, we took Bart

43:23.120 --> 43:28.880
in to Embarcadero and we played around that part of market, which was really dead. But when we

43:28.880 --> 43:34.080
went out to Embarcadero street and walked down from there to Pier 39, yes, that is a long walk.

43:34.080 --> 43:40.400
I did 12 miles worth of walking yesterday, 23,000 steps. Uh, because that's just how much

43:41.040 --> 43:44.960
there was going on with the games. That's why I'm so tired today and a little sunburned,

43:44.960 --> 43:49.520
even though I used sunscreen, it wasn't enough. Um, but anyway, that stuff helped though, right?

43:49.520 --> 43:54.000
What's that? The stuff I used helped, right? Oh yeah. The, yeah, that we were talking about

43:54.000 --> 43:58.160
at breakfast. Yeah, it did. In fact, I could use a little more, but it's all right. I have

43:58.160 --> 44:03.600
multiple containers and it's all over the counter. No worries. No worries. Um, but anyway, uh, so

44:03.600 --> 44:09.760
there was tons, my point is there were tons of people like walking from Embarcadero to, uh,

44:10.320 --> 44:15.600
the pier and you know, a ton of them were playing Pokemon Go. I would say half the people on the

44:15.600 --> 44:19.680
street were playing Pokemon Go and the other half were going, why are all these people looking at

44:19.680 --> 44:25.760
their phones? And I heard people ask that out loud and all of that. And, uh, it was also very

44:25.760 --> 44:29.760
easy to spot people because they were giving away those little Pikachu hats. I didn't get one,

44:29.760 --> 44:34.720
but there were a lot of, um, uh, if you were curious, what were they doing in the cities at

44:34.720 --> 44:40.480
those locations? Cause certain cities had like special locations. Um, they had, uh, I don't know

44:40.480 --> 44:45.040
if they were Niantic employees. I doubt it. They were probably contractors that were either setting

44:45.040 --> 44:49.600
up a little photo op type things, or they were just giving away little Pikachu hats to people,

44:49.600 --> 44:53.760
which is fun for the kids and stuff like that. And that's pretty much all they were doing,

44:53.760 --> 44:59.200
but there were just so many people in San Francisco playing the game. It was quite a

44:59.200 --> 45:07.520
thing to behold also to put it into perspective. There's a badge now in Pokemon Go for, if you use

45:07.520 --> 45:15.600
a lure, how many, um, Pokemon get caught with your lure. That's one of the badges that you get.

45:16.160 --> 45:22.320
So I think my badge for that, thanks to community days and stuff like that was at about 500

45:22.320 --> 45:30.800
yesterday. Or when I started yesterday, after I put one lure down off the beaten path, it was

45:30.800 --> 45:34.960
near one of the photo opportunities, but it was still kind of off the beaten path a little bit.

45:34.960 --> 45:46.640
So after one lure yesterday, my stat is now 2,146 caught off a lure. So that means 1600 Pokemon were

45:46.640 --> 45:51.360
caught off one lure off the beaten path yesterday. So that's, that's how many people were playing

45:51.360 --> 45:57.440
Pokemon Go in San Francisco. Uh, so yeah, it's pretty crazy, but I had fun. Uh, it was honestly,

45:57.440 --> 46:04.720
it was more just about the people, the experience, the game is whatever it honestly is. I didn't get

46:04.720 --> 46:10.320
nearly as many shinies as Shane did. Um, because I, he's, I don't, I don't know what it is with

46:10.320 --> 46:15.840
that boy's luck. He got, he walked out of Go Fest with like 43 shinies. And I was like, I got,

46:15.840 --> 46:21.680
I remember when I caught the shiny sock and like the second hour of the day, I was like, well,

46:21.680 --> 46:25.040
that's it. My day is not going to get any better than this. I got the shiny sock. That's like the

46:25.040 --> 46:30.720
best thing you can get today. I guess I'm done. Uh, and I was right. I didn't really know. I got

46:30.720 --> 46:35.920
two of the, uh, Ching Cho, Chime Cho. I don't remember the name. It's a little like wind chime

46:35.920 --> 46:42.560
thing. Chime Cho. I don't remember what it's called. Uh, but that is the, uh, yeah, that is the,

46:42.880 --> 46:49.200
uh, Pokemon that I was able to catch two shinies of yesterday. So, uh, I guess that was cool. Yeah,

46:49.200 --> 46:55.920
I didn't get a dino shiny. I'm sorry to say it. So, Oh, Chimecho. Oh, I didn't know. Oh,

46:55.920 --> 47:01.280
that makes sense though. I'm, I look, I horribly mispronounced some, I have mispronounced all

47:01.280 --> 47:05.840
your names on this show. Of course I'm going to mispronounce Pokemon as well. So it happens.

47:05.920 --> 47:13.440
All right. Anyway. Um, so that was Pokemon Go. What else did I do in my gaming week? Uh, I did,

47:13.440 --> 47:17.840
uh, Dead by Daylight, of course, cause the anniversary event is still going on.

47:17.840 --> 47:22.800
Uh, trying to get some cakes. I finally prestige the character. Give us some more, uh,

47:23.360 --> 47:28.880
blood points though. That would be nice. Yeah. Blood points, but, uh, um, iridescent shards.

47:28.880 --> 47:34.720
Oh yeah. That too. That would be nice. Um, so, uh, yeah, I played a little bit of that,

47:34.720 --> 47:40.080
but not a lot. I played a little more Yakuza, uh, like a dragon. I got up to chapter five on

47:40.080 --> 47:44.560
that. So I'm still moving on with that story. Uh, and then randomly, this is super random.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.640
I decided to, uh, play blaster master zero again. Cause I was just in the mood. Well,

47:48.640 --> 47:53.360
I was reading stuff. I had forgot the third game in that series is coming out.

47:53.920 --> 47:59.920
I knew there was a two. I never, I, I, I, maybe we had briefly mentioned three on this show,

47:59.920 --> 48:04.480
but I'd forgot. And like, it's coming out very soon. Um, so I was like, I should play through

48:04.480 --> 48:10.880
that series again. So I started playing blaster master zero again. Um, cause it's fun. So there's

48:10.880 --> 48:20.240
that too. Tay plays games and chat says playing DBD in 2021 cringe, which by the way is another

48:20.240 --> 48:24.160
stream y'all should be following. Uh, Tay is saying, um, you're, you're talking about

48:24.160 --> 48:28.960
playing DBD in 2021. You play a lot of, although I think now, now, now he's an Overwatch main,

48:28.960 --> 48:37.840
I think actually. So in watching some of the recent streams, but, um, well, a few other

48:38.720 --> 48:42.720
typically DVD streamers have been switching on to some other things lately too.

48:43.520 --> 48:50.240
I, a lot of, um, feedback that the anniversary event is not having the positive effect on the

48:50.240 --> 48:57.440
game that people thought it would, that people are playing DC thing to where they start. Yeah,

48:57.440 --> 49:03.520
there's that too. Holding people accountable for being assholes. Anyway, shout out to Tay. Um,

49:03.520 --> 49:08.640
everything, everything I needed to learn about looping, uh, and teabagging in dead by daylight.

49:08.640 --> 49:16.640
I learned no teabagging in my game. All right. Uh, anyway, let's, uh, let's move on. Uh, I think

49:16.640 --> 49:22.880
that was it for my game. Let's get into some more news and, uh, I love, I love this one that we're

49:22.880 --> 49:28.720
going to get into here. Loki, please start us off. So there is a brand new, uh, we kind of talked,

49:28.720 --> 49:34.800
we briefly mentioned it last episode, but there is a brand new fighting game, uh, kind of akin to

49:34.800 --> 49:42.080
smash brothers called Nickelodeon. All-star brawl is coming out by the developer, uh,

49:42.080 --> 49:48.560
lewd last Luda city. And they said that, um, you know, it's going to be out on pretty much

49:48.560 --> 49:51.680
all the different platforms that are out there right now, all the console platforms.

49:51.680 --> 49:56.960
Um, but it's just, it's drawing characters from like all of like Nickelodeon shows all

49:56.960 --> 50:01.200
these different Nickelodeon shows. So there's like, you know, stuff you would normally expect

50:01.200 --> 50:06.480
to be in there and then like other things as well. Not only that. So aside from the characters,

50:06.480 --> 50:12.640
we'll get to those in just a sec, but there's also, um, you know, it's actually a decent

50:12.640 --> 50:17.600
fighting game based on like some of the features that they're implementing, including roll, roll

50:17.600 --> 50:24.160
back net code as well, which is actually a little bit better than, uh, the part that slays me is

50:24.160 --> 50:29.520
that the internet code is going to be better than smash brothers. Yeah. So that's, that's kind of

50:29.520 --> 50:35.760
funny. Um, so, so the characters announced so far, um, and this is pretty awesome. So

50:35.760 --> 50:41.840
you have from Ninja turtles and this is the 1980s Ninja turtles, Leonardo and Michelangelo.

50:41.840 --> 50:46.320
That's the one most people, why is there no Raphael? Well, they've only announced some of

50:46.320 --> 50:49.680
the characters yet. They haven't announced everybody yet. So this is just what was featured

50:49.680 --> 50:53.840
in that first trailer. I assume that all of them will be in there. I mean, come on,

50:53.840 --> 50:58.240
Tiger, Tiger, you're just going to have to humor me here. The eighties Ninja turtles are the ones

50:58.240 --> 51:01.840
people remember and want to see in these things. Okay. Cause that was the arcade game too,

51:01.840 --> 51:06.720
is the eighties version of the Ninja turtles. Yeah. So you have a Nigel Thornberry from the

51:06.720 --> 51:14.960
wild Thornberry, um, Ren and Stimpy from Ren Stimpy also powdered toast man, uh, from SpongeBob

51:14.960 --> 51:19.520
square pants, which I expected SpongeBob characters in there. SpongeBob, Patrick star

51:19.520 --> 51:26.720
and Sandy cheeks. Uh, we have a Blina from our real monsters, uh, the loud house,

51:26.720 --> 51:32.480
Lincoln loud and Lucy loud. Also a cartoon. I haven't watched, uh, Helga from Hey Arnold.

51:33.040 --> 51:39.760
We have Reptar from Rugrats from invaders in which sold me the game right there. Um,

51:40.000 --> 51:48.320
um, Danny from Danny Phantom cat, dog, um, Ang and Cora from, you know, avatar. So,

51:49.360 --> 51:55.840
um, that's just pretty awesome. Okay. And then in case, in case you're wondering, um,

51:57.200 --> 52:02.400
for those who are hesitant, uh, John K Chris Savino and Butch Hartman will not be paid for

52:02.400 --> 52:08.720
royalties for this game. Cause you know, I guess they're questionable. Um, I mean,

52:08.720 --> 52:11.840
there's other characters you can probably assume are going to be in there. Obviously

52:11.840 --> 52:17.440
Reptar is probably not going to be the only Rugrats character. Um, but we need Angelica

52:17.440 --> 52:21.920
with princess powers. Okay. So hold on before y'all shout out the characters we need. It was

52:21.920 --> 52:26.960
suggested. We do a list list on this topic. Now I don't, I don't have everything set up for a list

52:26.960 --> 52:32.400
list, but I think we could do an informal list list here. I need to read some of the suggestions

52:32.400 --> 52:36.720
from chat though, because you all are fucking slaying me right now. I'm dying. So, okay. Some

52:36.720 --> 52:42.400
of the chat, uh, comments here from chat, we have, um, uh, Tay plays games, uh, says,

52:42.400 --> 52:50.320
do I get to play Lori Beth Denberg from all that I love her. Fun fact, Alan and I actually looked

52:50.320 --> 52:54.400
into cause she actually will do weddings. Now we looked into it. That's all I'm going to say. We

52:54.400 --> 52:58.720
didn't do it, but we looked into it cause I, I would have loved that. Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt

52:58.720 --> 53:07.440
says, so is Linda Ellerby from Nick news, master and, or the final boss. I love that. Uh, some

53:07.440 --> 53:11.680
folks say Mr. Wizard. Okay. You guys are, you guys are going to say, so here we go. I would like to

53:11.680 --> 53:20.400
know informally three suggestions you have for the Nickelodeon fighting game. Um, Loki, clearly

53:20.400 --> 53:24.000
you've been stewing on this. I need to give Jamie a little, maybe she's been doing that too. I'll

53:24.000 --> 53:27.760
give her a little time to brainstorm, but, uh, Loki we'll go to you. What, what would be like

53:27.760 --> 53:34.800
your top three suggestions for the game? Um, so, and I had to dig deep, um, for some of these.

53:35.440 --> 53:41.200
So, um, starting with number three, David, the gnome, you gotta be in there. Um,

53:42.320 --> 53:51.520
I think we have to have, uh, was it barf from, um, you can't do that on television. And then gosh,

53:51.600 --> 53:58.000
um, I mean, Mr. Wizard would be pretty good too. I think that'd be funny just cause he's so mean

53:58.000 --> 54:04.560
to the children sometimes. Uh, or he's, he's harsh with them. Um, gosh, I don't know. Um,

54:04.560 --> 54:10.560
there's so much you could do. Like they could really tap into so many things. Like, um, you

54:10.560 --> 54:15.120
know, if they want to get like into like the live action stuff, you know, already the strongest man

54:15.120 --> 54:20.400
in the universe, you know, something like that, like just all sorts of crazy. All right. I'll do

54:20.400 --> 54:25.920
my top three. Um, so my number three would be the sec. I'm going to show my age here. I don't give

54:25.920 --> 54:32.400
a fuck. My number three would be the security guard from today's special. Um, I love today's

54:32.400 --> 54:38.480
special. Me too. That was my jam back in the day. So I don't remember the dude's name, but, uh, he

54:38.480 --> 54:42.960
was, he was, Oh no, it was the other one was the mannequin that would only, it was like straight

54:42.960 --> 54:47.200
out of that lady. The lady would only come to life when looked at or whatever, but I think the

54:47.200 --> 54:52.640
security guard was the one I remember. So, um, uh, let's see dark to see it says, Sam, I think

54:52.640 --> 54:57.760
I will go from that. Okay. So, uh, that would be my number three. My number two would be the giant

54:57.760 --> 55:02.960
nose from double dare. Um, that was always part of the obstacle course and they would have to like,

55:02.960 --> 55:07.200
you know, dig through the nostril to find the flag. And it was really gross. So that's my

55:07.200 --> 55:11.840
number two is the giant nose from double dare. And then my number one would be, and somebody had

55:11.840 --> 55:15.520
already said this in discord. I don't care. I'm stealing this joke. My number one would be Alanis

55:15.520 --> 55:21.360
Morissette because I stand and be, she, she was, as everybody knows, part of the cast of you can't

55:21.360 --> 55:26.960
do that on television for a short time back in the day. So, uh, Alanis Morissette would be fair game

55:26.960 --> 55:35.520
to be in the Nickelodeon fighting game. Uh, so dark, uh, dark, dark Sakura, so many people with

55:35.520 --> 55:42.000
dark in their names, dark Sakura, what is your top three? So my name, uh, starting with number three,

55:42.400 --> 55:52.000
I would reckon Moira Quirk from guts. She was a referee. The Astro Craig has to be the stage.

55:52.000 --> 55:58.960
Absolutely. She's she's still, you know, uh, done a lot of voice acting. So she's been in stuff like

55:58.960 --> 56:04.320
recently and she's even worked in Skyrim and everything. So would get really great voice

56:04.320 --> 56:16.560
acting from her. All right. Love it. What else? All right. So, um, Hmm. Eureka from Eureka's castle.

56:16.560 --> 56:27.600
Yes. Yes. Okay. Um, and then the, uh, the era of drama actually, no, I take that back. One of the

56:27.600 --> 56:34.080
tomorrow people. Oh, shit. Okay. Well, I forgot that was on Nickelodeon for a short time. Who

56:34.080 --> 56:40.880
was the redheaded guy from, from the nineties tomorrow people. Oh, that's a good one. All

56:40.880 --> 56:45.760
right. Um, you guys in chat are killing me. Okay. You ready for some more chat suggestions? Here

56:45.760 --> 56:51.760
we go. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says the pinwheel. That's it. Just the pinwheel. I was actually

56:51.760 --> 56:56.640
looking at the stuff on pin on pinwheel house. Cause I almost thought about the, uh, the hat

56:56.640 --> 57:02.880
people. Um, and I mean, we've got also fairly, there's like so many good things, fairly odd

57:02.880 --> 57:08.640
parents, you know, Timmy Turner or something like that. Um, nobody came so close to saying

57:08.640 --> 57:13.600
Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but Phineas and Ferb is on Disney. I'm actually super disappointed. Nobody

57:13.600 --> 57:19.360
brought up any of the characters from, Hey dude, like the dude ranch should be a stage going to say

57:19.360 --> 57:25.360
the boxers from salute your shorts. Okay. Um, other comments in chat, you guys are going off.

57:25.360 --> 57:31.120
I love it. Um, why no record in chat says need someone from wild and crazy kids. Yes. There were,

57:31.120 --> 57:36.080
they had the same host for years. Uh, and then, oh, our voiceover guy, Jason is in chat. The

57:36.080 --> 57:42.560
xj6 V says game over the bully from Nick arcade. That's a good one. Tiger class suggests danger

57:42.560 --> 57:50.000
mouse. Yes. Yeah. Or a banana man. What was his little pinfold? Was his friend? No, remember

57:50.000 --> 57:58.960
Penfold. Penfold. Shush. Uh, let's see. I'm dying. Oh my God. Those are all the, the Thames

57:58.960 --> 58:06.000
production ones. And when Nickelodeon used to go off the air, if you remember those days, I do,

58:06.000 --> 58:11.680
I do. I was really young, but I do. They would always show after danger mouse or count

58:11.680 --> 58:17.440
Dracula, depending on the day, they would show, um, banana man. I also remember for a short time,

58:17.440 --> 58:22.640
it would be the A and E channel at night. It was Nick in the day. That was before Nick at night,

58:22.640 --> 58:27.520
if you can believe it. Yeah. We don't think at night's going to have to be its own fighting

58:27.520 --> 58:35.920
game. Like we can't. Hey, Rob, what did you know that, um, in the third season of the nineties,

58:35.920 --> 58:41.120
tomorrow people, Christopher Lee was the villain in it. No, I'm going to have to go back and find

58:41.120 --> 58:46.400
all of these. Cause I missed a bunch of the ones before they canceled it. Honorable mention to

58:46.400 --> 58:51.360
powdered toast man from Ren and Stimpy by the way, now that it's on my mind anyway. Oh, uh,

58:51.360 --> 59:00.400
character log. Okay. So, um, near Muse says I beat you by seconds with a dude while they are,

59:00.400 --> 59:05.440
uh, subscribing again to the channel. Thank you for that. Uh, you guys it's, it's very obvious.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.080
A lot of people, especially in their thirties and forties, go in some in their twenties,

59:10.080 --> 59:16.160
go figure. A lot of people have a lot of passion around the Nickelodeon franchise. There is a lot

59:16.160 --> 59:22.080
of potential here for an amazing game. So I really can't stress this enough or stress this

59:22.080 --> 59:28.960
enough. Excuse me. So do not fuck this game up. No, no, no, no. To go into that, let's talk a

59:28.960 --> 59:34.160
little bit about how this actually came about. So, uh, developer actually put out a game called

59:34.160 --> 59:39.840
slap city, which is kind of a similar type of genre and game. So after they were put,

59:39.840 --> 59:45.840
they put that game out, they were approached by Nintendo to make this game. So, um, you know,

59:46.080 --> 59:50.640
they do have, you know, Lisa track record of putting out, you know, some decent fighting games.

59:51.200 --> 59:57.520
Um, but yeah, right now they said, you know, they, they don't want to talk about the full roster,

59:57.520 --> 01:00:04.080
but like, I I'm, I'm hoping that it's going to be like, I'll pay for DLC for all, all this obscure

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.800
shit. I mean, like, seriously, like if, if, Hey dude, and you know, all that stuff's gotta be

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:15.120
deals. Get a single, you can't do that on television reference in there. I will lose my shit.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:20.800
Like I, or even as a stage, I'll take a stage. Like the locker jokes as a stage would be great.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:27.040
Oh my God. That'd be amazing. And the lockers open up and they're telling jokes to each other.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.320
Oh, that would be great. Oh, I love it. I hope, I hope their boardroom conversations on making

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:40.160
this game are as lively. Um, uh, I'm sorry. Take place games and chat says slap city has

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.400
insanely good reviews on steam for what it's worth. So let's not hype this up too much,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:58.800
but on the other hand, too late. All right. What was that? You want to know what sucks is I've

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.640
been going to see if I can find blue rays of the tomorrow people. No, I think that's great. That

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.560
was an awesome show. Didn't they try to do a reboot of that a few years ago? They did actually,

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.920
and they got really great reviews, but they didn't renew it. It was on CW thing. Yeah. I remember

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.720
that anyway. All right, let's move on and talk about other awesome ideas out there. Maybe,

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.520
I don't know. We don't know a lot about this idea, but we do know final fantasy 10, three,

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.320
maybe there was a 10 and a 10, two, of course. And, uh, many people are aware of these games

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.560
from the remasters that they made, uh, on PlayStation three and PlayStation four.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.920
And I think these did pretty well. I know a lot of people revisited the games. Uh, they ended up

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.840
coming out on Xbox game pass. So I'm sure 10 and 10, two, the remasters did pretty well for square

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.760
and it probably, it could have them discussing like what might a 10, three look like someday.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:58.240
And as it turns out, uh, Tetsuya Nomura, who, uh, was character designer mentions,

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:05.440
if we are to make 10, three, we somehow have a synopsis written by no Jima-san it's sleeping

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:13.600
right now, but the plot itself does exist. Um, not Kazushige Nojima ads. I had the opportunity

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.680
to work with people who entered the game industry after playing final fantasy seven,

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.160
but now the phase has moved and I'm, I'm going with people who entered after playing final

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:29.840
fantasy 10. Um, Toriyama commented the probability is not zero, but we are not in a phase

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.400
where we can talk about it unless we have finished producing the final fantasy seven remake,

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.720
which I, I respect that don't bite off more than you can chew. And there's already a lot

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.400
to still be done with the final fantasy seven remake. We don't even know how many more parts

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.080
there are. Are they going to try to wrap it up in a second game or are they going to spread?

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.760
Because I I'm going to argue they, everybody expects it's going to follow the template of

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.920
final fantasy seven. I don't think it might. I think it could wrap it up in a second game if

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.000
they wanted to. I think it better not separate my, my OTP again, but, uh, we'll, we'll see anyway.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.840
But, uh, so there may be, you know, one or two more games, fall fast. You see if in remake series,

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.760
but it is interesting. They're leaving that door open to attend three and it's really the

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.480
equivalent of, so you're saying there's a chance is really where we're left when it comes to final

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.400
fantasy 10 three, but it is, it's, they did write the story for it. And also, you know,

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.720
there's probably stories and treatments that have been written for a lot of games

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.440
that never came to fruition. So it's, it's interesting to think what might that look like?

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.520
Uh, and even if they, even if they didn't make it a game, they can fancy 10 three oops, all blitz

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:44.160
ball. Oh God, no, I hated all the blitz ball stuff. There were rumors that blitz ball was

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.000
supposed to be added to the final fantasy 14 expansion, but for better or worse,

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:54.560
that didn't seem to come to fruition. So, um, dark Tetsuya in chat says, I still want a six

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.360
two. Yeah. There's lots of final fantasy games that people would like to see, especially,

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.560
you know, for a long time, the idea of sequels to final fantasy games didn't really exist.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.280
It wasn't until 10 two when it was like, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.640
They're doing 10 two. Why aren't they calling it 11? Oh, it's a direct sequel to 10. Oh,

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.920
11 is the online game. So it's, it's interesting. And then after that was when we got the final

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:30.000
fantasy four sequel folks forget about that. And I understand, cause it's really not a great game,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.640
but the after years was a sequel to final fantasy four. So it'd be, it'd be interesting.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.800
I'd love to see a 12 two, but what I really want to see is just a remaster of the 13 trilogy for

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.240
current consoles, because I think it's time to revisit that. And for, um, justice to be served

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.840
a little bit for Final Fantasy 13 in retrospect, cause I don't think it's as bad as everyone says

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:59.120
it was. Um, Tay plays games and chat is wondering who is 10 three made for most of the kids haven't

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:06.160
played anything other than 14 or the seven remake. I don't see a 10 three superseding a, a 16 and a

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.080
seven team. I'm not sure one has to cancel the other because square does have multiple development

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.640
teams and obviously they are capable of producing multiple final fantasy projects at a time.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.120
Uh, and I think that is best demonstrated by the fact that creative division three

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:28.960
is currently making final fantasy 14 and final fantasy 16. That is a huge undertaking and that's

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.360
just one studio at square. Granted one studio that has made square a lot of money. Uh,

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.960
thanks to Final Fantasy 14. And it's, but, you know, we could get into the whole thing about

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.240
how final fantasy 14 is only getting bigger right this second, which is, is interesting,

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.840
but I'm not, I'm not going to go there right this moment, but to answer the question that

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:53.920
Tay poses about who is 10 three made for, I think it's because of the remasters.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:59.040
It's not the original PlayStation two release. I think it's because of the remasters

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.800
that we do have another generation visiting those games. It's kind of like, and this is random,

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:11.360
but I don't give a fuck. You know, one of my favorite movie of all time period is clue the

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:17.280
movie from the 1980s. That movie fucking bombed at the box office. People did not understand the

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.760
multiple ending thing. Uh, it did not make a lot of money at the box office. It was way ahead of

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:28.400
its time. It was very much ahead of its time, but now people hold that in such a high regard.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.600
Even if they were born much later, you see a lot of, you know, people in their twenties and thirties

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:40.880
that love clue the movie, where did they find it? They found it in reruns on basic cable in the

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.680
nineties, because you guys might remember, do you guys remember channel 31, which is one of the

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.440
stations here locally. I don't care. I'm going to shout it out. Channel 31 used to play clue

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.920
the movie in the afternoon, all the fucking time. And there's a lot of stations around the country

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.840
where they did that. So a lot of people discovered clue when it was broadcast during the day on TV.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.280
Now, my point with that is I think there is a younger generation that's discovering 10 and

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.120
10 two because of the remasters. It, and the fact that these remasters are only like 20 bucks now.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.960
And so I, and you know, especially with the pandemic and people playing more games,

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.800
I think probably more people were playing these games now than probably did in the beginning.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.480
So I think that's why the conversation about 10 three is happening now in particular.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:31.200
So it's very interesting. Bobby Blackwolf says, is this the right time for me to profess my love

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:38.320
for speed racer 2008? Why not? I think a lot of people really shit on the matrix sequels when

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:44.400
they came out, but now look what's happening. Another matrix sequel. Like sometimes things

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:51.600
just age a certain way and people want to see them back. Jason and chat, literally the definition

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.480
of a cult classic. Absolutely. It's hard to call 10 and 10 to a cult classic because they,

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.160
unlike clue the movie, unlike the Rocky or a picture show, unlike some video games that

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:11.440
are cult classics, 10 did well when it released. Yeah, but I get it. I, I, I, I'm not saying that

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:18.560
label is inappropriate. It's just a little different. Um, but an excellent aside here,

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.960
Jason says, I discovered earthbound because it was the cheapest game at Walmart.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.040
Fifth dream does point out it's tens 20th anniversary. That's a good point too.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:37.680
So, wow. Wow. I would be all about a 10 three, but I understand there's only so many games that

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:43.840
square can do without compromising the quality. And I also realize that doing a game now with

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:49.920
the 4k textures and the PlayStation fives and all that stuff, it takes a lot more than it did on the

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.360
Atari 2,600 than the NES. It takes a lot more resources. It's a bigger industry. So I understand

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:01.280
they can only do so many games at once, but maybe someday never say never. You remember I imported

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.240
10 too. I do. I do remember that. I think the first time I ever saw it was you playing it.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.080
Yeah. Cause I had to, well, I knew it was going to have an English release, but I had to have

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.240
Kotokumi doing the music. All right. Let's move on to our next story because again, another thing

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:24.960
from this week that I think is huge news. So dark soccer. I can get my camera to not fall over.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:33.920
There we go. So, now I'm going to say this as someone who plays most of my games through a

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.600
streaming service. I love streaming my video games. That's how I get to play PC stuff on my Mac

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.360
and they look good. And people seem to be pretty surprised by it. Well,

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:48.640
it looks like Netflix is actually trying to get in on that action now too.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.520
You are the official Dead by Daylight Stadia streamer on Twitch.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.240
I don't know any other bitch that streams that game on Stadia. You are,

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.720
you have that market fucking cornered, honey. Well, yeah, but they won't let me put Stadia

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.160
in my keywords or Mac gaming in my keywords because whatever people don't think people

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.640
play on Macs and hello. Y'all should see my setup. Okay. My setup is pretty.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:26.240
What was that taste? Sakura is single-handedly keeping Stadia going. Huge. Yep. Anyway,

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.760
so Netflix wants to get on on that action. They are looking to offer video games through

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.920
their streaming service as reported to Bloomberg. They said that the games will appear as a new

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.760
genre on the platform. Kind of like how their documentaries and standups and other things go.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.520
They're not really putting too much out into specifics on that, but Netflix doesn't plan on

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:58.880
charging any extra for access. Oh, wow. And then there's also, I mean, some of the others are

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.080
looking into it too. Like Disney plus is, is trying to do it, you know, but I, uh, Disney

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:14.400
Comcast, NBC universal. Um, they have other outlets though, but Netflix is just Netflix.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:24.080
Right. Right. So they're looking to, to add more to, uh, their user base. Um, maybe right now,

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:32.000
as of well, as of April of this year, um, it, uh, uh, reported 208 million subscribers globally,

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.480
which added another 4 million after the first quarter of 2021. Um, they thought it was going to

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:45.360
go, uh, get higher, but it still grew decently. It was just a little bit less than they thought

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:52.640
it would, you know? And so they're really looking to diversify. Um, and I mean, and it's not like

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.760
they haven't had ties with the video game industry. Um, there's a strange, there was,

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.280
uh, that stranger things video game that came out in 2019 and stranger things was licensed to dead

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.160
by daylight. We keep bringing up. Yes, but that is true because the demo doggy is cute.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:20.640
He's a cool little woofer. Um, but also, um, they they've had Castlevania. Um, there's other,

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.280
other video game related stuff that's been around. That is an interesting full cycle thing

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.040
is that like, Oh, Netflix really became this booming place for video game media. And now they

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:38.080
might want to take that back to actually having video games or choose your own adventure content

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.840
as well. So like, yeah, yeah. Um, what limited gaming exists now? Yeah. Netflix just had the

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.240
rentals. You could rent some games, but you couldn't play when the streaming service replaced

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.320
the rental service. You of course, at the time technology didn't exist to stream a game like

01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:00.560
that, right? Because there were closest I had to a streaming game was like playing tetranet.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.400
There were, um, folks like game fly that were trying to sneak into that market about being

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.640
the Netflix games in that regard, like literally when we're talking about discs and that service

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.720
still exists. Actually, Bobby talks about using it still to this day. Um, I'm just curious like

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.040
to what, what intensity of games are we talking about? And that's, I feel like the wildcard here,

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.320
because yeah, when you think of Netflix games today, you think about, okay,

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.440
Minecraft story mode is there. It's it's different, but it's there. Uh, the Netflix said the

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.760
bandersnatch black mirror, which is very, it's choose your own event, but it is a game. It

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.760
qualifies a game, but it's very limited. Are we talking about those sort of limited experiences?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.720
Or is it something that's really meant to be done on your PC? Because when I think about Netflix,

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.440
I think about logging on on my Xbox logging on to my PlayStation logging on on my television.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.960
And what's, I mean, a, are Microsoft and Sony going to allow Netflix to get into this space?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.520
Well, they also had Minecraft story mode as well. That was,

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.800
I know I mentioned them. Yeah. Keep in mind as well. I mean, now we're,

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:05.680
I'm going to take a little touch on politics. Okay. We just had that executive order issued

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.800
for a higher competition in business markets. I doubt very seriously that the other, the,

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.560
the competition is going to be able to say much about it. Thanks to the new legislation.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.360
And, and to be fair, only to get a replacement for a GPI still though, which they haven't

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.200
filled that position yet. So right now they can't do anything until that happens.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.680
And at least in Microsoft space, I remember I was playing ant stream on the Xbox one and ant

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:37.680
stream is a cloud service for retro games. So that whole concept of like, I guess streaming games,

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:43.840
even if it's not necessarily a Microsoft product, at least in the X Microsoft space,

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.000
we've seen it happen before for some weird reason that client's been unavailable for a while.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.080
I'm not sure what's going on with ant stream because my subscription finally ran out and

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.000
I don't plan on re-upping until I can get it on Xbox again specifically the Xbox series X.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:06.400
But I, I think it's interesting, at least there, that sort of precedence is there. So Bobby,

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.680
I think in their discord, the Xbox one client is even unavailable at the moment. It was there

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.680
before, but I remember them saying there was some issues or something like that. I could be wrong,

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.440
but I would want them to have it on series X and S and all that stuff.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.480
For the record, by the way, I did also just real quick take a peek because there's a fairly recent

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:35.200
article about Stadia as well from gamesindustry.biz which is a pretty good site for some general news.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:42.480
But they were talking about how, of course, Epic has sued Google for the way that their

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:50.000
revenue models work. And they're supposed to be readjusting their revenue models.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.320
So that's coming up a little later in the show, actually.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.920
Is it? Oh, I wasn't aware.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.680
We'll talk about that later. Yeah.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.440
Okay. But at any rate, according to everything here, it does look like they're alive and well.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.600
Yeah. So I-

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.840
Didn't see any point in doing their own development.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.840
I'm just curious, again, what types of games are we talking about on Netflix?

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.600
And I want to see a little more about what that looks like before I really try to

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.280
put on the crystal ball and all that and really try to predict anything.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.080
Okay, sorry. Go ahead.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.440
Okay. They hired Mike Verdu to be the vice president of game development.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.120
Huh?

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.720
I was just saying, I did hear that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.600
Yeah. But basically, he was the VP of content for Facebook reality labs

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:44.560
and a senior VP of mobile for EA. So he's got a good resume behind him.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:54.720
His CV is looking pretty decently. And then the one I would have more of a worry about

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.760
is Amazon's. I don't think it's going to do very well.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.400
You know, that kind of plays into a comment that Tay plays games,

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.880
says in our chat is that GeForce Now and Stadia are already struggling.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.680
Why not capitalize on it? And you're right. Amazon's,

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.040
I don't remember what it's called, Luma, Luna, something like that.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.440
We've barely heard a blip. Luna.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.160
We've barely heard a blip about that. So that really only leaves

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.200
Microsoft's entry, which they really haven't fully gotten into yet.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.760
Like I still feel like Microsoft's still kind of like teasing it and

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.840
dipping their toe in the water with the whole X cloud stuff.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.200
And, you know, so so I agree that like if Netflix is going with a cloud based strategy,

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.880
that could be very interesting. And, you know, again, especially

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:46.240
if they are bundling it in with their movie part, it means it's going to open it up to all these

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.680
people who already have Netflix. And I think Netflix has to kind of look at how do we get

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.680
pretty much everybody who's going to sign up for Netflix for movies and TV has already done it.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.160
How do we keep expanding beyond that? I don't really think that right now that

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:07.120
Stadia or GeForce are really struggling because they've got a decent market.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.920
I mean, I personally know more people on GeForce than on Stadia, but.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:19.040
I mean, everything's been kept up to date and Stadia, Google has more relationship deals with

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.560
these companies that they're offering the game to space through.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.080
But I mean, like neither is that unbeatable Goliath yet.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.640
No, not yet. Not yet. But I think that because they got the head start on it,

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.480
that I think they're going to stay. They've already got their names behind them.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:46.000
And GeForce probably like if you're going to think of a tech company, you know, Google is

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.920
going to be up there above Nvidia because you're thinking of Nvidia when you're thinking of parts.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:57.680
And lack of graphics cards, we're looking at the ability. Yeah, but but at any rate.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.200
I think.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.440
I think Netflix has a good chance. I don't think Amazon does.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.920
We'll see. I still need to know more about Netflix, but I think it's I think the fact

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:23.040
that they can essentially Trojan horse their service to millions of people that already have

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.400
Netflix is going to give them something that these other companies, all of them that you've named,

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.440
don't have. And I think that's going to be fascinating.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.160
I should tell you what the deciding factor for Stadia was for me,

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.040
was that because keep in mind now it was strictly for Dead by Daylight, right?

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.600
Right. But I have a bunch of other games because I pay for the the pro.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.440
And I've got lots of good stuff on there that I can play that I have played.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.200
I mean, I've never had any lag or any problem with it. Just, you know,

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.680
if the server goes down, the server goes down and that's all it is.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.280
But what I like is that the thing that really cemented it for me was the fact that

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.960
Behaviour had that thing to link my Stadia account to my Steam account.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:13.920
So that my achievements and everything will cross over, even if it's by the DLC again,

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.280
which I already had a bunch of the DLC anyway, and we bought them on Stadia.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.800
So that was my deciding factor. The fact that Google has relationships

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.760
like this with other companies sort of speaks to me.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.120
Yeah. All right. Well, a good discussion. And I think this is really just the first

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.880
of many nights we're going to be talking about this in the coming months as we start to see

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.720
more of what this looks like. Well, and one last little thing.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.120
Yes, of course. I'm hoping that this ends up being healthy competition.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.280
Oh, yeah. That it encourages these other

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:55.520
companies to make their models more attractive. To maybe offer like tiered subscriptions,

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:02.320
for example. I mean, Amethyst Rose, which, you know, my friend and coworker,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.840
she uses the G4 service and pays like five bucks a month. I pay nine for Stadia Pro.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.120
But, you know, Stadia Pro is also going to give you like a bunch of free games while you're at it.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.560
Just saying, yeah. And Tae plays games and chat says,

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.360
hi, Timmy, we already pay $17.99 a month for Netflix. Now you can stream games.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.480
That is absolutely going to be what gives Netflix a competitive edge if they're not shit games.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.920
And that's obviously and here we go again, back to that OLR golden rule we've been saying for

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.160
years and years. The system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.400
That is exactly it. So if Netflix goes into gaming and it's just a bunch of shit,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.360
Android games that are, you know, ported for streaming service or whatever, not saying that

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.400
every Android game is bad, but we know there's a lot of garbage out there.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.920
I don't think they'd go that way, though. I'm not people. I'm I'm hoping so. I'm hoping you're

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.360
right. Let's see what they have in store when they start announcing what the games are for sure.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.080
DJ Rama S and I'll let this be the last comment says the NES, the Netflix entertainment system.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.880
We'll see. We'll see. All right. Moving on, Loki.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah. So this is at least a rumor of a brand new IP being worked on by the coalition,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.520
the folks behind Gears of War, of course, leaked from a linked in

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:35.200
profile, basically saying that someone is a level designer on brand new IP at coalition.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.560
So I mean, yeah, Gears of War is not going to go on forever. So it makes sense that they'd

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.720
be working on something new. What are we going to hear about that new IP? Who knows?

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.880
I don't know. It's not surprising.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:55.840
I'm curious to see what they're cooking up. It's nice. It's nice when you can kind of get

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:02.080
away from that franchise that you've like people don't think you can make anything else with that

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.240
game. So I think it'll be nice for them to kind of get away from that and make something different.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.560
Yeah, I'm sure. I don't know. I'm sure it'll be cool.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:16.080
Yeah. All right. Something I think is going to be pretty cool. I hope so.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.760
And is also going to be competition in the MOBA space is Pokemon Unite. And now we know

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.960
when Pokemon Unite is coming out. That's right. It's a Pokemon MOBA. So it's League of Legends,

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.600
Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2, but it's Pokemon.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.560
Oh boy.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.080
Yeah. This is the game that will get Shane to play MOBAs. And I actually know I'm

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:42.080
I'll shade aside. I'm actually excited to try this because I've really sucked at other MOBAs

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.280
like League of Legends. I've been bullied off of that game. Heroes of the Storm. I will only

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.920
play PvE because I was bullied off of that game. Dota 2. I'm not sure I still completely

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:59.440
understand. So I kind of love the idea that there's going to be a Nintendo MOBA because

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.520
hopefully I won't be bullied off of the Switch, but I might be. I don't know. We'll see.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.760
So is it is it Nintendota?

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.560
I'm leaving now.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:16.400
Why are you like this? All right. Anyway, I've been this way for a long time.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.640
Pokemon Unite. We know the date. It's going to be the 21st next week. So by the next show,

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.320
this will probably be a part of my gaming week. It will come out on the Switch.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.720
So this is in advance of the mobile release. They're going to have a mobile version of this

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:37.360
as well. And if you get into the Switch version early before August 31st, you will get a mythical

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.400
Zeraora, which will let you use that Pokemon, which I imagine they're going to be. It's free

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.440
to play, but they're probably going to sell characters like a lot of games do and items

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.160
and things like that. It will have cross-play capabilities with mobile. And yeah, we've known

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.040
about this for about a year now. In general, two teams of five Pokemon are going to try to kick

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.920
each other's butt. There are different scoring areas on each side. You score points by capturing

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.400
wild Pokemon on the field. You want to score more points than the other during the time period,

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.680
you get to level evolve and learn new moves by defeating wild Pokemon. I think that is an

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.160
interesting concept that none of these other MOBAs that I know of anyway, have is that like,

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.520
let's say you play a Charmander. I don't even remember if that's one of them in the game,

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.680
but as you play the game, you evolve into Charmeleon Charizard. And I think that's kind

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.080
of neat. The concept of like an evolving character. What about Charmander Shepherd?

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:38.080
Um, probably a DLC that will cost you $20,000. Um, it'll be like that Dead by Daylight DLC

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.000
where you're paying more for a fucking Kriskin than you did for the Resident Evil DLC.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:50.160
So I paid for the Kriskin as did I because and the Claire and the other Leon and all of them,

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.720
because I paid for survivors, Rob. And guess who doesn't play survivor?

01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:04.240
Okay. Repeat after me, Dark Sakura. I, I am a consumer whore. There you go. You got it.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.400
That's how, you know, we've known each other forever. We finish each other's sentences.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.000
We finish each other's sandwiches.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:27.520
Uh, Mike Deft is pointing out the Unite beta in Japan was actually fun says Mike Deft. Um,

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:31.920
and, uh, half the chat has left the chat after Loki's joke. Thanks for that, Loki. You know

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:39.040
how to keep the ratings going. Good, good job. All right. And, uh, the mod bot just triggered

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:45.920
on the word whores. So now we've, we have now allowed the word whores so you can free

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:53.200
refer to them as sex workers, Rob. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh,

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.640
I think this next story is kind of interesting. Uh, Dark Sakura.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:06.480
Well, the man, the myth, the legend, Kojima Hideo, the man who gave us Metal Gear,

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.600
the man who gave us Silent Hill and more recently has given us Death Stranding.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.680
He doesn't like them calling the new release of it a director's cut. This is assuming that

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.560
there were things that were cut from the movie from the movie, from the game that are being

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:29.280
put back into the game because he's the director. And he said, so no, he says that this is a little

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.440
bit more, in fact, I'll just read his quote about it in the game. It is not what was cut,

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:41.120
but what was additionally produced that was included, uh, directors plus.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:51.120
So in my opinion, I don't like to call directors cut. Um, and so yeah, he, he,

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:59.120
it's just more content for the game. It's like a special edition. So it's yeah. Um, so at any rate,

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:06.000
um, calling it a director's cut was more, is more of like a marketing decision. The marketing team

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.040
did it. They did the same thing for, uh, the, uh, re-release of Ghosts of Tsushima, uh, Tsushima,

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.400
sorry, I can pronounce words, the director's cut for August 20th. Um, but basically what they have

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:26.000
going on, uh, for Death Stranding quote, quote, director's cut, quote, quote, quote, um, is that

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.560
it has new story missions, more combat exploration, a firing range or racing mode.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:41.600
Um, and 4k HDR options to launch on September 24th or an upgrade if you have the original.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:53.280
Um, but yeah, Kojima doesn't like it and we support the decisions of our Lord and Master Kojima.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.280
It is weird to hear somebody so openly defying. Like, I don't like what they did to this before

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.080
the fucking thing even releases. But at the same time, like I feel like Hideo Kojima can literally

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.480
do whatever he wants in this industry. There are very few people, I would say Miyamoto's another

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.280
one. There are very few people in this industry that are allowed to do literally whatever they

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:21.200
want. And people will be like, yes, Kojima, yes. You know, people will still, uh, eat it up. Uh,

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.600
and it's, it's interesting that he makes the movie comparisons when Death Stranding really

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:32.000
is cinematic in so many ways and in some ways has been razzed for not being much of a game.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.880
I disagree with that, but I understand that Death Stranding is very cinematic in its ways and that

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:44.320
the game part is not necessarily what people look forward to and playing that game, if that makes

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:50.240
sense. Well, and I think it's just his point that calling it a director's cut is, uh,

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.760
a misnomer of sorts. Yes. Yes. I know. And more special edition or whatever. Yeah.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:02.080
Right. Like a director's cut would like be like, say the Superman to Donner's cut.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:09.280
That's a director's cut. Right. Or going back and watching the original run of a Blade Runner

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.000
without the narration over the end. Cause Harrison Ford hated that.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.560
Now, what would you call watching legend with the superior tangerine dream soundtrack?

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.560
So it's not really a director's cut. I don't know. That's more bonus. All right. Anyway,

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.560
uh, Tay plays games and chat says, I read Kojima statement, but I was a bit confused.

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.800
Was he trying to say the additions fundamentally interfered with his creative vision or was it just

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:40.080
semantics? Um, I think it was just semantics, but you raised an interesting point. Could there,

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.720
could you read between the lines here and wonder, did Kojima even want to do this?

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:50.960
Or was he kinda asked extremely nicely, maybe not so nicely to do it.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.840
I sort of think Kojima again can do whatever he wants. So if they came to him and said,

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.160
we'd like you to do this, he had every right to say no, but maybe he's like,

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.680
but it could be more money for my next project. So let's just do it.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.560
Maybe it wasn't necessarily that he didn't want to do it, but it was more of like, Hey, we need

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.400
you to do a PS five port. He's like, Oh cool. I'm going to do that. And I'm going to add some

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.840
more things to the game. And they're like, we're going to put director's cut on. And he's like,

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:29.120
well, and don't forget that Kojima is talking with, uh, Microsoft about, uh, a potential deal.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.800
Right. There's that little buzz, buzz, buzz going around, right?

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.640
Well, don't forget Phil Spencer had the little Kojima pro figure.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:47.360
Oh, Microsoft on his desk. Microsoft's just Microsoft is Phil. Spencer is so fucking good.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.680
Like I, I couldn't have, we had him for the Sega Saturn. Why, why could I, I'm just,

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.440
I'm excited. He's in this industry now and I'm excited. He's leading Microsoft. He's just,

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:04.320
he's so fucking good. All right. Yeah. Although I, I, what I hope is that we get something

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.400
that is what silent Hills was supposed to have been.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.680
You know, it's just having this discussion in the car with, um, Shane and Dustin on the

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.840
drive back from SF last night, we were talking a little bit about like the PT demo and how,

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:22.400
you know, it just kinda, you know, it's people still talk about the PT demo to say, hello,

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:27.280
here we go. You want to know what I have a Mac version of it called punity.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.080
Well, and well, and just the fact, okay. But there's lots of versions of PT because that

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:37.600
has inspired people to make all of these clones, knockoffs, emulate, like.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:46.000
Well, the assets exported for this. Yeah. Um, well it had the assets, uh,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.120
exported for the build that I have. Um, but there's also, I mean,

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.280
people are still talking about it. We had boundary break, uh, episodes of it just last year.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.120
Yeah. Well, and my, my whole thing that, you know, the discussion was,

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.760
was how many elements of that maybe ended up in death stranding since they were, you know,

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.480
they both had Norman Reedus and a lot of the other guests, you know, you kind of wonder how many of

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.920
the ideas maybe really were in death stranding. And we just don't know. It may have been a thing

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.680
that was in Kojima's original silent Hill vision. Cause we didn't get to see much of it sadly.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.840
Now I'm not saying death stranding is like what silent Hill would have been no,

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.640
but you got to wonder how many concepts may have been a part of it.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:31.040
I think that death stranding is far larger in scope than the narrative of silent Hill.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:36.640
I think that whole concept of the baby providing guidance and all that,

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.160
I think there's something there that ties to the silent Hill concept.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.360
Because remember in the PT demo, when you've got that, like really

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.400
that thing talking to you in the sink and all that stuff.

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.840
What the fetus? Yes.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.640
Like I think there, I feel like there might be a connection.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.440
So I don't know. All right.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:02.080
I don't at all. I think that the PT itself was to, was to be something to build the buzz

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:08.480
for silent Hills. I think that what happened in that house probably had nothing to do with

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.880
what silent Hills was going to be. And, you know, because that seems like a Kojima thing to do.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:20.080
All right. You know, like, I mean, look at, look at metal gear, solid,

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.360
uh, uh, three. What, what was right in there for?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.360
Uh, it's been forever. Yeah. Or was that two? I don't remember.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.200
Yeah. It was the one with right in it

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.240
where he was pretty and I liked him and he ran around naked holding his crotch

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.640
while the guy yelled, we need scissors 62. Mike deaf says that was two.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:46.640
That was two. Okay. Um, I just, that part will always just stick in my head forever.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.600
We need scissors. All right. Let's move on to, uh,

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.600
our next story here, which, uh, we kind of referenced a little bit ago, but Loki.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:03.920
My bad. Yeah. So, uh, say is going to be giving developers and publishers, um, more of the cut

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:10.720
of the sales. So starting October 1st, they're going to receive 85% of the sales revenue. Um,

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.640
and then the split applies to only the, the first 3 million of sales. And then it will

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:22.560
only be in place until the end of 2023, in which case it'll go back to the current revenue split

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:30.880
as it is on top of that. They're also going to be splitting the, uh, stadia pro subscription

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:38.800
fees as well. Um, assuming that the publisher puts their title into the stadia pro lineup,

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:44.000
which is that game library that you get, you know, free with your membership. And then based

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.640
on the engagement with those, they will get a cut of that as well. So it depends. So it's

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.920
good to be involved with it. And also the game has to be played by people. You can't just like,

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.080
you know, put crappy game in there and just get a cut of it. Right. Um, there's some people that

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.320
are reacting to this news going, Ooh, she's desperate, but, um, I'm not sure it's really

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.080
that. I think it's just, this is competition kind of playing off a little bit because now

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.560
Amazon is in this space. Now, you know, the G force and all these other now Netflix,

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.320
even though this decision was made before, I'm sure the Netflix thing came out, maybe they were

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:25.120
reading some tea leaves. Um, but I think this is more about the lawsuit though. Also with like,

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.280
say Apple in that whole thing going on because of the cuts that they're taking from their storefront.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.480
They're trying to like hard to say when you're not in the boardroom, but, um, anything's possible.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:43.280
Sure. Yeah. So, all right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, we gotta keep it moving here. Uh,

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.840
we're going to talk about this next story, which I think is really funny when a company leaks its own

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.200
game. Uh, let's talk about Neo. The world ends with you. How many of you guys are looking forward

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.960
to that game? Cause I know a lot of people have been rediscovering the original world ends with

01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.120
you game with the switch port and everything like that stylish. Yeah. Well now you can play

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:06.400
the stylish sequel Neo. The world ends with you except, um, some folks got to, uh, check it out

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.640
a little bit early. Here's the thing. Um, if you pre-ordered a physical switch copy on the square

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.640
Enoch store, they acts at the square Enoch store accidentally started sending out digital codes on

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:26.080
July 16th. The game's not out until the 27th. So somebody hit the fire button early on those emails.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:33.600
So oopsie, but it's kind of hard to like a feel bad for square Enochs. They did it themselves.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.760
We're not talking about like, Oh, it got hacked and leaked that way. Nope. They just sent out.

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.080
And for whatever reason, the codes worked that you'd think that would be the other thing is that,

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:47.440
okay, the codes just don't work till the 27th. But whoops anyway. Well, the other thing too,

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.560
which is kind of weird with that is like, typically with digital games on like even

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.320
the switch storefront, like you can, you can preload them, but they won't let you unlock

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.080
it until the night. So it's like, they just, they whoopsie the few times they're like,

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.440
it's not going to be it's fine. It's also important to point out they were getting

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.200
digital copies of the full game and it was, they they're getting physical copies. That's

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.400
what they pre-ordered. So folks are thinking the digital codes were probably supposed to be for

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:26.720
like a soundtrack, some bonus DLC, cosmetics, something like that. And oops, all retail codes.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:34.320
Just send them codes, like reviewer codes instead of like soundtrack codes or something.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.880
So people really could, if they wanted to, they could just keep that digital code they've redeemed

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:42.960
and sell their physical edition and they'll still have access. Nothing's going to, I mean,

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.760
I guess technically in the rules that you agree to when you sign up for these online things,

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.400
and this is part of the controversy of digital stores, Square, if they wanted to,

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.440
could pull access to those codes. Because I've seen that, I've seen that happen with

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.800
preview and early release and types of things before is that they pull the codes so they no

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.800
longer work after a certain day. But I don't know if it would be a good idea for Square to do it.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.600
It would depend on probably how many people this affects. Like if it's only several hundred people,

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.160
they're probably just going to write it off. They're going to have to.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.400
So we'll see. But I just, I think that's hilarious that the company themselves

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.200
accidentally sent out the game, but these mistakes happen. It's a complicated industry, you guys.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.760
Tay plays games and chat says, is always hard to feel bad for Square Enix. Well,

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.440
they are a very big company. That is true. So, all right.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.560
I still think more of the Enix, they should be bringing back some of the old Enix titles,

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.280
like Bust-A-Move. That's right. No Forgiveness for Square Enix until Bust-A-Move part three.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.000
Or four, I guess. Dance Summit.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.520
Four. Hey, Dance Summit is fun. Don't knock it.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:01.840
No, I know. I know. But all right. Anyway, since Dark Soccer has brought up some older games,

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.520
I think it's a good time for an old favorite here at OLR.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:22.800
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.760
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:31.440
And what did you pick this week, Dark Soccer?

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:45.120
I picked Sakura Taisen from 1996 for Sega Saturn. And this game is fairly unique and

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:56.720
it was multiple genre combining. And it really was, I mean, something that spawned several sequels

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:06.160
and so much, so many manga. And remember my Cardcaptor Sakura that I have on Dreamcast?

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.360
They came with the plate and the fork and the clock and everything.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:09.840
Oh, yes.

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.240
And the pillowcase. They did a Sakura Taisen for Dreamcast that came with some of the

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.320
same stuff. And yeah, the music in Sakura Taisen is absolutely great.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:31.040
So it was the first installment created by Hiroi Oji. It came out on the Sega Saturn and then was

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:37.120
later ported to Dreamcast and had a remake for PlayStation 2. And Sega defined it as a dramatic

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:45.120
adventure game. And what happened is that it was an overlay of three different genre. You had

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:54.400
tactical role-playing, you had a dating sim and a visual novel. So it was set in 1923 during the

01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:01.360
Taisho era. And it follows this group called the Imperial Combat Review, which is a military unit

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.480
that fights supernatural threats against Tokyo. And they have a cover as a theater troupe.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:11.680
Um, one of the ensigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy,

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.960
Ogami Ichiro, was assigned to lead the flower division, which was all women with magical

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:26.720
abilities. And they use steam-powered armor. So it's sort of like turn, well, I'd say early,

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:35.680
early 20th century, um, steampunk-ish magical Japan. That seems pretty okay.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:44.240
Um, so the concept for it began in 1990. Um, the team that, um, Hiroi had, uh,

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:50.880
sort of working on his concept and then got approval, uh, by Sega. And then it brought in,

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:58.880
um, some pretty good, uh, writers, character designers and composers, like the composer was,

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:07.520
um, Tanaka Kohei. Um, and among some of this stuff that, that he did, um, he did some stuff

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:15.600
it will in, uh, uh, anime, he did the arrangement opening and ending for Dragon Ball. He did, uh,

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.160
some stuff. He did, uh, some stuff for Patlabor, you know, where I'm talking like, like the awesome

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:26.160
eighties anime, he did stuff for bastard. He did stuff for a spirit of wonder dragon half,

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:33.040
you know, so, uh, Tenshi Mujo GXP, he also did, I'm trying to think of some more recent stuff.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:41.760
Um, he did the Sakura Taisen animation that just came out in 2020. Um, Hayate the combat

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.240
butler, if anyone else has watched that, he did a bunch of, uh, full length movies. So I'm just

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:54.160
saying he's got a lot of good, he did the music for Gravity Rush and Alundra. So anyway, I just

01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:03.840
wanted to, to point out the music was very good. Um, so going back into this, um, like I said,

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:11.040
it's cross genre. So you have the two gameplay modes. One is an adventure mode and the other is

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.400
your battle mode. The adventure mode is between, uh, these different periods where you navigate

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.640
the grand Imperial theater and interact with the characters. And then the battle mode is a

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.640
turn-based battle system on a tile grid kind of, you know, it's tactics, it's a tactics style game.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.760
And so your progress is saved at the end of each episode. So the episodes go like you're watching,

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:38.240
um, uh, an anime. They, they have, uh, each different episode as you're going through the story.

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:47.360
Um, so, uh, you have an adventure mode, you can walk through the theater. I kind of thought it

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.120
was a little bit like Danganronpa a little bit for the walking around. Um, and then you have

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.680
these critical conversations that you can have with the flower division and the supporting

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.400
characters. Um, and they give you a time limit for you to put in your input. So depending on

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.920
how you respond, the character may respond positively or negatively, and it affects your

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:16.320
future interactions. Um, and then there's also, uh, you can hold like your cursor over the character's

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.080
portrait to hear their inner monologue, which is fairly interesting. Um, and then of course,

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.560
each of the main, uh, heroines have their own different quirk that you have to remember so

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:34.560
that you can raise their trust level with you. So dating sim. Um, and so, uh, for the, the battle

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:43.360
mode, you have, uh, each unit has their turn and each has two actions. Um, you can do two actions

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.800
during, during your turn. So you have attack, defend, move, and death blow, which is a one hit

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:54.800
kill. Um, you also have some charging. You also have healing, um, which those are done to like

01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:01.840
the unit. Um, and if you, if you lose, you can rematch. Um, and it's got animated cut scenes and

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:12.560
musical numbers and all kinds of fun stuff. Um, so the game in and of itself was partly proposed

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:20.320
um, by way of tabletop role-playing games. Um, the, he called, uh, Hiroi and the team called

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:27.440
them Sakura 1 and Sakura 2, which were the strategy elements came into the game from this

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:32.240
and as well as the story came in and they were also, you know, took a lot of influence from the

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:40.400
Fire Emblem series, you know, with the turn-based, uh, combat using that grid. Um, and then once

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.280
it was, you know, they had a full idea together, they, you know, the project will make a great

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:52.640
game. He proposed Sakura to, uh, different companies and none of them was interested in it.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:00.240
And so he, he put the game aside and then, um, the vice-president of Sega at the time, um,

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:09.440
Iri, I'm going to mispronounce this, Iri Maigeri Suichiro, um, had contacted him about the, uh,

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:16.240
possibility of doing a game with a mascot for, you know, to develop a mascot for the Sega Saturn.

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:26.320
Um, and Hiroi had some different suggestions, um, but it was eventually, this is what led to

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:39.360
Sakura Taisen coming out on Saturn. Um, so at any rate, it has a lot of things in common. Um,

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:48.560
it basically is a bishoujo game, meaning pretty girl, you know, um, as, as opposed to bishounen

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:53.120
for pretty boy, but you have, you know, anyway, going, going back. So there were lots of things

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.880
in the battle scenes were, um, that were, uh, influenced by, uh, TV of an earlier era,

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:06.000
like the common writer series and Ultraman, um, by having like the larger mecha fight.

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:15.680
Um, and so the art design of going into the art design on this one, um, the, uh, the art

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.080
had some, there were some placeholders on there, but it was finally, uh, designed, fully designed

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:30.320
and finalized by Fujishima Kosuke, who did Oh My Goddess or Amigami Sama. Um, you know,

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.920
I'd say the anime probably had a lot more popularity in the nineties. Um, but, uh,

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.760
but his work was like the glue that held the project together. And so he came up with all

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:48.320
kinds of outfits and everything for them. And then, um, the supporting cast and general animation

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:55.440
was done by, uh, Matsubara Hidenori. Um, so they, they really had, you know, they,

01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.160
they also did a little bit of the basis for their general style, like for the uniforms,

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:12.720
sort of loosely based off of, um, uh, early British soldier uniforms a little bit. Um,

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:19.520
and now Hiroi was going to do this in Meiji era Japan, but it looked like it was going to

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.080
be better to do it during the Taisho era, which is when Japan was integrating Western culture

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.840
more so, and hence the designs of the uniforms. So, um, and also though in the original draft,

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.960
it was supposed to be a lot darker because it brought into account the great Kanto earthquake

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.560
and then the breaking down of the Taisho period, but they threw that out totally and just kept

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.920
certain elements that were gonna, uh, you know, just keep it a little bit more light and

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:51.680
lighthearted. Um, and so, I mean, basically that, that's it. It had some great voice actors. I mean,

01:49:51.680 --> 01:50:00.000
first of all, um, Sakura was voiced by, uh, Yokoyama Chisa. Um, she, uh, she's been voice

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.920
acting those since eight 87, like that, uh, black magic M66. That was like a, what I really liked

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:11.920
back then robot carnival. Um, I'm trying to think of something that more people might've

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:23.840
heard her in Rojin Z, uh, Miki Momo, um, golf horse. Uh, she was, uh, uh, Murugu and Yu Yu Hakusho,

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:30.320
uh, Himechan no ribbon. She did some stuff in there anyway. Um, so yeah, uh, you know,

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:38.480
they got some pretty great voice talent in there. Um, they have, uh, had some singers who were also,

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:44.480
uh, um, doing some of the voice acting roles because they had to be able to sing as well.

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:51.040
Uh, you know, uh, a couple of, um, the, uh, actress, the actor actor who is actually, um,

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:57.600
Ogami, the, the main guy had almost no voice acting. Um, he was in training for a voice actor

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:05.840
and they, they took him in and he did really well and he was the last, uh, character to be cast.

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.320
So, yeah. Um, I'm, I'm going to get a little bit past some of the background on this. It had a

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:18.400
great soundtrack, the Sakura, uh, Tyson soundtrack, steam gramophone 51 tracks from the game published

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:26.480
by BMG Japan. Um, and then, um, there was the vocal collection also done by BMG and then the

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:35.200
2003 remake, um, was released by, uh, Avex mode. Hmm. So, um, so yeah, for releases, it was, um,

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:41.200
a special Sega presentation in 1995, uh, for release in April, 1996 for the Sega Genesis,

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:47.360
not Genesis one missing Genesis, the Sega Saturn. Um, and it was dubbed a dramatic adventure. Um,

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:54.080
the port for Dreamcast came out May 25th, uh, 2000 with a version for I mode mobile devices.

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:59.760
Um, and of course that was the special edition that had also plates and saucers and all kinds

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:10.000
of goodies. It had windows ports, um, for windows, Emmy and windows 2000, um, uh, windows 95 and

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:18.240
windows 98 as well. It had a sequel on PSP. Uh, there was also the DVD ROM version out for windows

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:25.680
2000 XP and Vista, um, ASCII core did, um, some, uh, guidebooks for them. Um,

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:36.320
but it never did get an English release. Um, they, uh, he really wanted it to be released in,

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:44.800
in the U S um, but there is a patch, a translation patch out for Saturn. Um, as we can see from the,

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.200
the playthrough that we have going on, I think we're seeing a Twitch. Yeah. Yeah.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.960
Yeah. It's a fan translation. Um, so there was a PS two remake. Um, it was a 3d remake

01:52:54.960 --> 01:53:00.080
called Sakura Tyson in hot blood, and it was announced as part of the Sakura Tyson world

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:09.520
project, which was an effort to bring it to a new audience. Um, and they did lots of reworks. They,

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:18.560
uh, changed the, the functions in the, uh, the, the story mode part of it. Um, they brought back,

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:26.640
um, all of the original, uh, actresses recorded new voice acting for it. Um, and there you go.

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:32.640
It came out in February 22nd, 2003 first prints came out with a special DVD that had a documentary

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.320
dealing with the development process of Sakura Tyson and mobile tie-in stuff. Many games,

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:45.840
other stuff came out, but, um, they, uh, they were going to have access to be content through

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.400
a direct cable connection, but because of driver capacity issues, they did a password system

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:59.280
instead. The game was wonderfully received. It got a, uh, 33 out of 40 from Famitsu,

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:08.800
um, a 35 out of 40 for the PS2 version. Um, it did get, um, uh, a couple of English language

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:16.400
reviews, including a game fan, um, Dreamcast magazine, uh, had their own, uh, review of it.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:26.320
The sales were amazing. Um, it was, he promised that it would sell 200,000 units and, um, it

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:38.480
actually sold 2005, sorry, 205,270 units in the first week. So it is considered to be one of the

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:47.120
best-selling, uh, titles of all time. Um, it's like 40, 54th as of 2003 for the, for the remake.

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:53.760
Um, the only thing that outsold it in its timeframe was Star Ocean till the end of time by

01:54:53.760 --> 01:55:00.800
Enix and Dynasty Warriors 4 from Toei. That's with that, uh, that version. Um, so it also had

01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:06.640
other, uh, releases. There were three sequels, Sakura Taisen 2, Thou Shalt Not Die for Saturn,

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.480
Sakura, uh, Sakura Taisen 3 is Paris Burning, which makes me laugh for other reasons.

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.800
Right. Yeah. Sakura Taisen 4, Fall in Love Maidens for the Dreamcast.

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.880
That's the one that came with this stuff, by the way. Um, there was supposed to be, um,

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:29.600
there's a fourth sequel for PS2 called Sakura Wars 5, Farewell My Lovely. Um, it was published

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:39.600
as Sakura Wars So Long My Love outside of Japan. Um, it had, uh, anime, manga, uh, you know,

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:50.240
character CDs. Um, it had, uh, some of the characters showed up in Project X Zone on 3DS.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.920
Um, there's the OAV series, uh, Sakura Taisen, The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms.

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:03.760
Um, Studio Madhouse, um, was behind, uh, well, actually, um,

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:09.760
it was co-produced by Red Company that did Sakura Taisen, Madhouse, and Studio Matrix.

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:17.040
Um, and it basically expanded upon the first game. It had a few more things behind the scenes. And

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:22.320
there was, of course, the manga, um, that was serialized in Monthly Magazine, uh, Zedd. Um,

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:29.600
and then it has since been released in Tankoban, um, afterwards. And so, uh, published by Kodansha.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.800
And that's it. That is everything. Well, not everything you should know, but it's a lot.

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.920
Sakura Taisen is one of the ones I've been holding off on for a while because so much.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.080
But it's also interesting because I would bet a lot of listeners out there, I mean,

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.680
I'm sure plenty do know about this series, but I bet there's a lot that don't, um, and just how

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.360
much of this there has been. And, you know, kind of, as you pointed out, it's really kind of unique

01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.840
to the Japanese gaming audience because they really have resisted, you know, putting this out,

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:05.520
uh, for, you know, our local, yeah, our localized, uh, audience for some time. And it took fan

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.600
translations and stuff to make that happen. But, um, obviously this is a huge franchise,

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:14.480
just maybe not here in this country and musicals, according to yes.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:25.920
To, uh, there is, uh, Shin Sakura Taisen. Um, and yeah, I, I, uh, I, I wasn't going to go too much

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.840
into what else the, uh, the voice actress had done, but the voice cast is really, really top.

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.160
I mean, even this guy for this, having been his first role to play the main character,

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.120
he did really well. I thought it was great. All right. So there it is your classic game

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.040
of the week, Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars. All right. Uh, let's move on actually quickly before

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.640
we get into rapid fire news. I remembered I left something out of my gaming week and I thought this

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:56.240
would be kind of funny. Um, since we were out doing Pokemon go yesterday, uh, we, we had taken

01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.800
the Bart over there and we'd, we'd, uh, written, which is the train basically in the Bay area.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:07.360
So we, um, exactly. Um, and so we had parked at Concord, you know, that area. So we actually

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:13.520
ended up going over to the Concord mall to eat and, uh, we went around one. So I, I haven't

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.960
been around one since, you know, before the pandemic. So, um, I saw a lot of folks playing

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.360
DDR and that stuff, which I wasn't going to get on there in a mat with a mask and everything.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.800
People play DDR to mask and all that stuff now. And I'm like, ah, I just don't, I don't have the

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.600
stamina for it, you know, and so forth, but there's a 2d X machine in the corner.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:39.840
They had the latest one. It was the, um, the B B's Bistro. I don't know what the cooking one,

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:44.080
cause it has a little cooking mini game at the end. So I, I just sat in the corner and played

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.280
that over. That's it then. Thank you. Beast over. I sat in the corner and played that all night.

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.040
Now I was definitely grandpa on the machine because I was like, I'm going to play songs

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:59.440
from third style. Jamie, I played, I played the Safari. I did be me. Uh, but I did try,

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.120
but I was, do you agree the best version of Safari is the original version and not the fast one?

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:10.000
Yes. The original is much better. Um, but I, you know, the fast one was what was on the machine,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.640
but I did unlock through that mini game. I unlocked some song that I tried. It was a

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:19.600
nine star song though. So I flopped. I did as my last stage and I flopped. It was really good song.

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.560
I played some of the new songs and I was into them, the ones that I picked. Um, so I, yes,

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:28.160
I tried to mix up my classics with some contemporary stuff, but yeah, I thought some

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.840
you might get a kick out of that as a, Oh yeah, I played two DX this week. And it's, it's actually

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:39.600
where I was at the arcade and I played nothing but two DX. I didn't, uh, the, um,

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:43.520
Shane was playing the one that looks like the, the washing machine where you hit the edge on

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:48.800
the outside and it's all bright. I can't remember the name. Oh, um, my, my, is that it? No, I thought

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:54.880
I had a different name. Is there another game like that? Waka it's Waka. Oh, Waka. Oh, that's

01:59:54.880 --> 02:00:02.480
what he was playing. Um, I like my, my, and like groove coaster was playing, uh, that a lot, but,

02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:07.600
um, Oh, Jason says, you can see your play history on the EMU's portal. I need to log in and set up

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:12.880
my card and all that stuff. Um, I really need Roseville to get the round one up and going,

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:18.480
I would play more two DX in the arcade. If we're like kind of coming soon for a long time now,

02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:24.000
like I understand, you know, COVID fucked everything up. Like I get it. So I'm not like,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.160
why isn't it out? But I'm still like, Oh, hurry up and open. Cause I want to play so bad.

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:36.560
So one of these days, um, let's see, what was, uh, I was trying to think of it along with the

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:41.280
music games. Oh, you know, what's interesting. A friend of mine here locally bought a theater,

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:46.320
the machine and has it in his house now. And I want to go over and play it so bad. Cause I love

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:50.560
like theater isms. One of my favorite music cabs. Cause the DS game is no dance rush.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:56.640
Lots of fun. I love theater them. The arcade version's really cool. And he has it in his

02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:01.760
house. He had the money and, and setting up a little arcade in his spare room. And he really,

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.000
cause he's a huge final fantasy fan. So he really liked it too. Um, so yeah, I'm hoping to go over

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.920
there and play that. So that'd be fun. I don't know if he has it hooked up on EMU's or, or

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.920
it's not EMU's, but you know, a comparable system. I don't know if he has, cause I have a card for

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:20.320
that. So anyway, uh, Bobby Blackwell says I have considered getting a used 2DX cabinet for my

02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.120
arcade. They are lots of fun. They are big and make a lot of noise. The only problem is at round

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.520
one, everything makes noise. And so sometimes it's really hard to hear, but I get, I have a

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.720
hard time there. Well, if I think ahead, you can plug in headphones into these newer machines,

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:40.480
but I just, I don't plan right for this stuff. So my bad. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.320
Let's get into some other rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:52.480
in the industry. Uh, Loki. Yeah. So like we, um, we've talked about some of the different Bethesda

02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.200
games and stuff coming out and different exclusives and timed exclusives. Well, one of

02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:02.000
the other games that was also supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation five ghost wire Tokyo

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:10.320
has been delayed to 2022, but, um, not a huge surprise and, you know, obviously

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:16.320
COVID did play a big part of that. So we'll just have to wait longer. It's fine.

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.440
And then, uh, apparently there's going to be an update to, uh, Android with Android 12,

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:29.760
that'll actually allow you to play games as they download. So they said some titles that support

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:35.040
that they'll be able to play within seconds, which is pretty cool, especially for some larger

02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:39.680
download games. And if you're downloading in a spotty cell signal area or something as opposed

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:47.200
to weekly. So, yeah, they said, for example, you know, like a 20, 127 megabyte game, um,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.280
can be played after about 20% of it's downloaded. That's getting very common these days too. Cause,

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.480
um, you know, some PC and I'm sure Mac stuff, you know, it's kind of like that. And then, um,

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:03.440
Microsoft X-Box is doing that stuff too, where it's like, when you download game pass games,

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.880
you probably only be a third of the way in the download and it's ready to run.

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:15.280
So it's kind of nice. We like that. Yeah. All right. Uh, so, um, it seems like almost

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.760
every week I have something about someone found a really good copy of this old game and it sold

02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:26.960
for a bunch of money that happened again. Um, now super Mario 64 is the world's most expensive

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:34.240
video game. It just sold for 1.56 million, which broke the record set by the legend of

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:41.520
Zelda two days before. Um, and, uh, it was again by put up by heritage auctions. Um,

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:53.360
and it was purchased after 16, uh, 16 bids. And, uh, this particular, uh, copy is, you know, nice

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:03.120
new in the box. Really pretty. Yeah. Um, but also it was, I mean, the game has significance

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:14.000
because it was, uh, uh, you know, the first, you know, real 3d Mario game. And it was kind of weird

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.120
because I think it signaled a transition away from cartridge based gaming because it wasn't

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:28.080
too long that CD and DVD and then blue Ray replaced everything. Although we had our moment

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:36.080
with the, with the giga desk. Good job, Sega. True thumbs up. Um, so yeah, there you go. Um, it,

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:44.800
it sold for a lot, a lot of money. It was, um, in near perfect condition. Um, it had a plastic case

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:52.560
and was still factory sealed and shrink wrapped. And it rated a 9.8 or an eight plus plus rating

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:59.520
on the water scale. So it was practically undamaged. It was near perfect. Um, and they

02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:06.320
said they found no notable, uh, imperfections. So good deal. All right. And moving forward, um,

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:13.360
now we're getting into more Mario and a little bit more luxury. Now I thought that I was,

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:19.120
I had my eyes set really high when I went in my Hermes, uh, Apple watch still kind of want one,

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:27.440
at least want the band, but now, uh, uh, Tug Hauer, which is like one of the top luxury

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:36.800
watchmakers in the world, um, has a limited edition super Mario watch. Um, and, uh, it's,

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:47.680
it's a smartwatch. Um, and its price is $2,150. Um, sheesh. Yeah. Actually I take that back

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:53.040
because there's a typo on this. It shouldn't be dollars. That's, uh, 2,150 pounds.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:04.480
So it's even more in the dollars. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, it looks cool. It's got a red band.

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:11.680
It comes with a nice case, you know, and you pretty much, I think get like lifetimes of

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:21.520
repairs on it because, uh, Tug Hauer is like, yeah. Yeah. When they talk about Swiss precision,

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:30.640
this is some fucking Swiss, uh, precision from a Swiss watchmaker thumbs. So anyway, um, yeah,

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:37.200
go buy me one. Thank you. I still want my Hermes. Uh, I'm going to seek something in here real

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:41.360
quick, uh, before we get to world release dates, um, because it was mentioned in our intro tonight

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:46.400
by Jason, but one other announcement that came out on July 15th has to do with path of exile.

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:50.160
You know, that game has been around since 2010. That's like an 11 year old game at this point,

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:55.520
kind of the free to play answer to Diablo three, uh, path of exile had a new expansion announced

02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:01.200
called expedition and it's out very soon. It's out, I believe on the 23rd was the day for that.

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.600
Um, so it's coming out very soon and it's going to be doing some different things to the game.

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:11.760
Uh, so you have to excavate relics in the game and, uh, you are doing this to, uh, you know,

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:18.160
make peace with new merchants, uh, in the world. Uh, but there are also new support and skill gems

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:22.560
that are going to be added to the game. So that means you'll get to see some new skills. Uh,

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:28.240
there's a skill called spectral helix and something called explosive concoction also.

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.560
And this is also very interesting, I think, because this might be a reason to revisit

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:38.800
path of exile. If you haven't done it in a while, uh, balance changes as well as a rework of the

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:43.760
first act is coming as well. And then I think they're talking about the flask system is also

02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:48.240
going to be changed. So this is some pretty hefty changes in advance of path of exile too, which is

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:52.720
still a thing that's happening. Um, so yeah, I'd be curious to check this out. I think it's the

02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:58.000
23rd on PC and I think the 28th on consoles. So, um, you can check that out in the coming week,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.160
uh, cause remember path of exile is a free to play, uh, type of game. So pretty cool.

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:07.120
All right. Uh, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:13.280
Yeah. So in the U S we've got a few things coming out this week, starting with Akiba's

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:18.320
trip, hell bound and debriefed coming on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:25.040
We have Ender Lily's quietus of the nights and that's on PlayStation four,

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:34.560
a cotton reboot on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four. Uh, Chris tales on PC,

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.000
Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, and stadia

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:47.680
deaths door on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series X, uh, Pokemon unite also on

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:54.480
Nintendo switch this week. Last stop on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation

02:08:54.480 --> 02:09:01.280
five, Xbox one and Xbox series X. And last but not least forks must die three on PC,

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.760
PlayStation four, Xbox one and Xbox series X. All right. Going to Japan and looking at some of the

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:14.720
releases there on the switch this week, we have Sengoku Kohime Otome Kenran Sengoku Imaki comes

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:20.080
out in a regular and limited edition this week for the Nintendo switch. And, uh, it's kind of

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:25.680
a slower week in Japan. This week is the only other release we have here is a Renai, uh, Kari

02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:30.720
Chamimashita, uh, is out as well on the switch this week. Uh, trying to see if things are a

02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:36.800
little more exciting on the PlayStation four or five. Uh, we do have Utawari Umono,

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:43.280
Zan two is, uh, out in a regular and a premium edition, uh, this week on the PlayStation five

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:50.320
and the PlayStation four also has that same game coming out on that. Um, but that is really it.

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:54.480
It's, uh, somewhat of a slower week. I think last week there was a ton in Japan. So it's

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:59.760
a little slower this week, but, um, still some stuff. Well, we have some stuff for the UK.

02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:09.280
Um, on the 20th, we have blasphemous deluxe edition. Um, Chris tales also on the 20th on

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:17.440
the 21st, right in four. I love the right end games. Um, the Sims cottage living, uh,

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:24.080
Akiba's trip, hell, uh, hell bound and debriefed on the 23rd further on the 23rd. We also have

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:31.360
cooking mama cook star. There's still cooking mama, um, lost words. Is that the one that mines

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:38.320
your Bitcoin on your, uh, on the switch? Remember that old wacky thing? I think it came out that

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.560
actually wasn't true, but still is hilarious headlines. Sorry, Jamie. I had to go and then

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:50.800
Peter's going to make another version of it. Um, so, uh, urban trial tricky. Um, the keep

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:59.040
also comes out. Um, we have necromunda hired gun and blue fire. Blue fire looks kind of cool.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:07.360
All right. We have some more stories and then we'll get to your emails if there are any,

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:13.520
or some of your discord posts and drag talk, your chat comments as well. We'll get to all

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.880
that in just a moment, but first some more stories. Loki. Yes. So everybody's still

02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:27.360
frustrated with the Nintendo switch joy con controllers drifting. Um, so there has been a new

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:33.280
kind of fixed proposed online. If you don't want to send your joy cons into Nintendo,

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:39.600
they have them repaired, um, using some cardboard and basically throwing that in there. I think it's

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:48.400
on top of the battery and basically applying some more pressure to the actual, um, joystick itself

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:56.640
to, uh, prevent it from drifting. So I probably going to try that at some point because I know

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:04.240
I've replaced the analog six in most of the joy cons that we have, although it broke one of them

02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:13.600
doing that. So that was fun. Um, but I still have a future to fix. And so it means worth a shot,

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:20.000
I guess it's been working for people. It's interesting that valve was actually asked

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.840
about that steam deck thing they're doing. Does do the, do the joysticks drift. Somebody actually

02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:29.600
fucking asked them that. And I thought that was a very hilarious question. They wouldn't,

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:34.880
they wouldn't know like until, because it's not something that would appear until like months

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:40.800
later. I wouldn't tell anybody anyway. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh, it's our joysticks are garbage,

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.120
you know? Yeah. Do you, I think it's also, Nintendo was asked that about the OLED model

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:51.840
and they declined to comment like they're not done shit. Well, because class action is either

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:55.680
happening already or it's going to happen. And so Nintendo is not going to say a goddamn thing

02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:02.320
about it. That's why they can't do it. They're not obviously not it. Obviously it is. And it's, um,

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:09.600
well, and also for them to comment on it with the OLED would be for them to acknowledge it exists

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.600
on the regular one. Although I don't disagree with you. It's probably going to be a problem

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:20.640
on the OLED, but that's the real issue for them to say yes, the OLED is fine is in, in also kind

02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.400
of conversely saying it's not fine. And that's just going to add fire to the class action.

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:30.400
That's why they won't answer it. Well, yeah. And the worst part about it too, is like even on,

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:39.840
um, was it the, um, was it the switch light is they, those dripped as well. And that you can't

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.360
replace those only can't, you know, replace them easily. You have to take it apart or,

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:51.360
you know, send it to Nintendo. So yeah. Oh boy. All right. Until then car,

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.800
I love that the chat is lighting up about cardboard. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says,

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:58.560
Nintendo Labo to the rescue. There you go. Since Nintendo just said, you know,

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:03.360
fuck Labo at this point, you can, uh, repurpose it there to fix your joy cons. Perfect. Uh,

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.560
orange. Right. And chat says cardboard. It can fix joy cons and 2d X controllers.

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.560
Do you remember your machines? Do you remember when folks would have to shave down the keys on

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:18.720
their 2d X controllers to get them to work better? I remember that was the thing. Hey,

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:25.200
that was the best part. I still have cardboard. Yeah. In my 2d X controllers in that closet,

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.560
the best part of the U S beat mania release was those controllers. Everybody wanted those

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.640
controllers because they were so much better, even though they didn't really change that much,

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.360
but they fixed the sticky key problem. Yeah. It's crazy. Hey Rob. I still have both of mine.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.920
Oh, that's nice. That's good. I, my, uh, beat media controller should be around somewhere,

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.760
but, um, I've got two Japanese ones and two us ones. That's awesome. And I have,

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:57.680
I still have an official five key controller. Oh, fine. And an off-market five key controller.

02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.240
I wish we had a pop and music controller. I wish we could revisit this stuff on home console,

02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:08.160
but you know, I can't find my copy of Para Para. I have, I have my biscuits. I don't have a game.

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:15.840
I'm sure you could find a way to play it. All right. Some other announcements from this week,

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.800
like we said it earlier in the show, it was a busy week. We had some announcements from El Gato. Um,

02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:25.520
because, um, you know, more and more people are getting into streaming and influencing and that

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:28.800
sort of thing. Um, you know, and I was talking about this a little bit with Bobby on our,

02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:33.440
our call tonight, but, um, you know, there's even whole sections at stores like Best Buy that are

02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:39.120
dedicated to, so you want to be an influencer and some of the tech equipment that you need

02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:43.280
for that. Well, no, I should actually, I promptly skipped that session, that section.

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:49.920
It's important. I reword this that they say you need, you don't need anything as you need drive.

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:56.480
You need a habit. You need, those are the things you need, but you do kind of need a computer.

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.600
Uh, if you have a phone, uh, if you had, there's other ways to do stuff. It just depends on what

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:05.760
you want to do. You don't necessarily like, and that's the thing about like the Best Buy

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:12.400
these things. It's not just about, uh, Twitch streaming. Maybe you want to do makeup tutorials

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:20.080
for YouTube. Maybe you want to, uh, film sketch comedy. Maybe you want to do the Tic Tac. Is that

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.360
what the kids are calling it? The Tic Tacs? You want to be a Tic Tac star? Uh, that's all along

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.240
with this too. So anyway, El Gato is kind of really trying to make itself like the, the

02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:35.120
community, like four streamers. So they're releasing a lot of this, uh, stuff that's

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.400
branded for this. And they, they did a lot of announcements this week. They announced a new

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:43.520
mic arm. That's like a hundred dollars. That'll make your, uh, mic cable transparent and all that

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:48.320
stuff by hiding it inside the arm. Uh, they announced a new version of the stream deck with

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:54.160
customizable faceplates. Woo. Pop them on and off and change them. Sure. I do want the new stream

02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:00.880
deck because I'm using the mini. Yeah. Um, and, uh, one of the other announcements they made

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:06.640
though, and I do think this is interesting is their own new webcam. So an El Gato branded

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.880
webcam. And what I think is interesting about, so they're calling it the face cam.

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:16.960
And what's interesting about this is it's taking cues from why a lot of people buy the really

02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:22.640
expensive 500, $600 cameras, and then hook them up as webcams on their computer, even though that's

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:28.240
not what they're really for. So what they're trying to do, it's not 4k. So it is missing that,

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:33.280
but, uh, through this El Gato software, which we have to remember is also a big part of what

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:39.360
El Gato does is all the software to support what it does, um, is that through the camera hub,

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:45.520
you can do contrast, exposure, white balance. Uh, you basically, you can format and like the

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.760
lighting and the way it's reading and all that stuff. You can make it kind of look like a really

02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:57.840
expensive camera through like the software and through the face cam. So kind of interesting,

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.280
although it should be noted, it has to be plugged in your system directly. It doesn't seem to work

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:05.760
through a hub. That's what a lot of the early reviews are saying, uh, is that, uh, and also,

02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:12.320
um, you, it needs, it's going to meet, you need USB-C for the high speed. Um, so something to

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:19.840
look at there. I think it's interesting though. It's $200, but it's a higher end webcam. So,

02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:25.680
um, yeah, I mean, I don't know how well they'd run on the, well, no, it's, it's just a camera,

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.520
so it should run fine as long as the software works on the Mac, but I would consider getting

02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:36.000
one for the studio. So it'd be interesting. Um, Bobby in chat says I stream in 720 P so it's

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.320
fine. Oh, talking about like the whole 4k and all that. Yeah. Yeah. Unless you're doing like full

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:45.360
face cam face stuff, like, you know, on YouTube or something like that, you know, but even then

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:49.760
you'd probably have a DSLR anyway. So for most things it's going to be fine. You're not going

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:55.360
to be 4k shrunken down to like a tiny little thing in the corner. I know people that use 4k cameras

02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:00.800
and it looks great. It looks really good. Like not going to lie. Um, but it's probably not,

02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:04.480
I would say you'd probably get more value out of that. If you double it up, like you're using it

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:09.520
as like, not just your webcam, but you do other kinds of shoots with it too. I'm using a 4k camera,

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:18.560
your phone using my phone. Yeah. So the quality is even better because I paid for the app for,

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:23.840
um, to link it up to OBS and it looks even better because it'll do it in full 4k on OBS. I mean,

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.800
my streaming isn't that high, but it will do it. But even though discord, you know, squishes it

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.040
down just because that's the nature of how we have to record it. If you were sending me a 4k image

02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:37.120
that I, I, my system wouldn't be able to keep up. So, um, but it still looks good.

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:45.520
I'm using one called camo studio to do for a discord. And I mean, it's, it's 720 P,

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:52.000
but it's, uh, you know, HD, it looks good. It's 30 frames per second, which is fine for discord.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:00.480
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, speaking of new releases, I think this one's great. Dark Sakura.

02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:11.360
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Um, wait. Oh yeah. You know what? I completely didn't open the story.

02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:19.200
My bad. It's all right. I need one. You want to tell us about it? No,

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:22.960
I'm going to go buy one now. Bye. You want competition on the pre-orders.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:27.760
So LG is doing

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:37.120
a great brand new TV that, you know, everyone's going to need it. Everyone's going to want this.

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:52.320
Um, it's, uh, a 17 inch, uh, four, three CRT television. It is the LG Siri S E R I E one.

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:59.600
Um, and yeah, it's a, it's classic CRT. It has a Famicom hookup hooked up to it in the picture.

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:04.960
Oh, that's awesome. See, finally, somebody coming to the rescue of all of these old CRTs,

02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.800
which if you don't know what that is, that, that talks about the tube that's inside those

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:12.880
old televisions. That's what they have. The fat backs that are very heavy. Those are all

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:19.840
which all your old arcade machines have them, all our old retro systems ran on them.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:24.640
And so, you know, as those CRTs are dying and nobody makes them anymore until now,

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:30.080
you know, they're very hard to replace and some people don't, especially with retro.

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.320
What? This story is from 2010. What?

02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:42.480
Who put this in for this week? I went back and looked at the date.

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:51.520
And yeah. All right. Sorry guys. Somebody put it in there, sold out. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:57.200
the webpage is gone. Somebody, uh, put it in the pool for this week. So that's, uh,

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:03.280
an oops on our part. How did that get dug up all these years later? Well, that happens.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:09.920
You know what? Old news circulates sometimes comes back up because I'm sure somebody must've

02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:17.040
pulled it from social media or something like that. Well, um, Hey, Ubisoft is, uh, doing a

02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:22.640
brand new Tom Clancy game. Yeah. See, so not to throw anybody under the bus, but dark to see a

02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:28.720
posted it on our forums or on our little thing and says, I came across this on Twitter.

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:35.360
So it's still floating around right now. As this is what I tell people on Facebook,

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:42.000
on Twitter, on everything, check the date. I'm with Tay announced in 2010,

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.680
but due to global supply chain issues, it'll be released next month.

02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:53.760
That I'm mad because I want one Nintendo TV. Maybe it is with a Famicom attached to it, but

02:22:54.720 --> 02:23:00.560
yeah. All right. Things happen. And you know what, again, if it was making the rounds on

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.080
Twitter, here's some really notable news. Hmm. Among Us has been translated into Irish Gaelic.

02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:13.440
Oh, that's random, but cool. Yeah. All right. Uh, I think we have another story here and I

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:20.560
think this is Loki's. Yeah. So, um, we can, I guess, talk a little bit about how

02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:28.880
Mario is got this unique version that's been donated now to, uh, a museum. So there was a

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:36.240
rare PC port of super Mario brothers three, uh, that was being worked on by its software,

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:42.960
or I guess in this case, it's ideas from the deep and, um, it never came to fruition,

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:48.480
but they did put a demo out or like start working on a demo. And now it's in the Strong National

02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:55.920
Museum of Play, which is in Rochester, New York. Um, but yeah, it says the individual who donated

02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:02.400
it was a game developer and it was something that they didn't expect to see, but, um, something that

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.760
at least they'd heard was rumored to be a thing. Um, what's interesting though is since the

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:13.920
development didn't go forward with it, they use the effort that they put into it. And, um,

02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:20.720
I guess maybe even some of the code or whatever to develop to commander keen. I knew it. I knew

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:25.040
the first time I played that commander keen, I'm like, this is just super Mario brothers three,

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:30.480
but like, you know, and this is back in, back in the day, but is it, you know, and again,

02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:35.840
the Mario PC thing isn't new news because again, that, that I know, uh, the video was out, you know,

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:40.080
several years ago when this was first brought up and everything. But, um, the news here is that

02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:45.280
now other people will get to see it in a museum. It's not just this, you know, kind of secret thing

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:50.640
that is like one video of it exists that was put out there. Um, that's just kind of cool, but like,

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:56.880
I, and even if you go back and watch that video now, you hear so much of like commander keen in

02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:04.080
it. It's so interesting. Yeah. Um, pretty cool. Yeah. As Joe and Hunter Matt says,

02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:07.440
I'm like an hour from this museum. Now I'll have to go there at some point.

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:15.280
Yeah. Give us the scoop. Tell us what it's all about. Uh, I made a bad dad joke. Yes, I saw,

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:21.280
I saw. And for more of that, you can join our chat. All right. Yeah. No one special in chat

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:30.000
says commander. Keen was one of my first steam purchases in 2013. Hmm. Interesting. All right.

02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:34.240
Let's move on. I got one more story for you guys, and then we're going to wrap up for the night.

02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:41.840
Uh, and that has to do with a classic game called chips challenge and chips challenge. A lot of

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:49.440
folks know from, uh, I think it was in like an old windows expansion thing. Uh, for a classic game

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.040
while I was out once. Yeah. I'm pretty sure we had to have, yeah. It was a windows game collection

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.000
or something like that. I can't remember what it was called, but I had it. I remember there's like

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:05.280
a windows 95 or one of those, like a game expansion thing. Yeah. Well, there's a console

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:10.160
port coming for this game. Uh, it's coming for the super Nintendo and I believe the Genesis as well.

02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:16.480
Yeah. A company called retro room games is remaking the Microsoft entertainment pack. That's

02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:22.640
it. That's it. Uh, it was originally on the links in 1989. I knew it was like an early game for one

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:27.040
of those. I think I have a copy for links. I think everybody has a copy of this game somewhere. And

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.240
again, I've mentioned this on the show before the guy who originally made this game is actually

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:36.880
somebody I know through other like games where he lives here. So I need to, I need not here,

02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.160
but he lives in the area. So I need to have him on the show at some point. Cause now,

02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:44.560
especially that this is news, uh, I'd be very curious to get his take on all this thing.

02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:48.480
So maybe I'll have to do that. I'll have to send him an email or a message and see if he's willing

02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:56.960
to come on the show. Um, but yeah. Uh, so, uh, let's see. This is going to, uh, of course. Oh,

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:01.760
yeah. The chips challenge had the, uh, re-release on steam in 2015. And then there was a chips

02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:09.520
challenge too as well. Um, so yeah, now you can get a new pal or NTSC format, super Nintendo and

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.400
Sega Genesis version of this. Uh, there is a box and instruction manual, just like the way games

02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:20.160
used to be. Uh, and then a 49 99, if you want to get the box, the instructions and all that

02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:25.040
good stuff, 24 99, if you just want the cart by itself, which I think is an interesting option

02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:30.800
in a way to do it. So they're still making super Nintendo games in the year 2021. How about that?

02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:38.320
And a classic at that. Pretty cool. All right. Any other old ass games you want to see ported

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:48.800
to an old ass system? Uh, maybe, maybe, uh, doctor says they gave it away on steam. I have

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.480
it in my collection. I remember playing it as abandonware, but I really like it. Yeah.

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:58.080
So it's a fun game. It's a classic. All right. Let's get to our next segment,

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:02.640
which is the listener round table. Uh, so every week we invite your questions via our chat room

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:08.960
over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And we also appreciate your emails over at participate at

02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:15.840
orange lounge, radio.com is the place to send your emails. Um, so we'd like to, uh, welcome that now,

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.240
except I don't think we have any emails this week, right? Nope. Well, that's unfortunate.

02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.720
You should send us more emails. Um, but that's all right. I understand. Uh, usually when we

02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:28.640
don't get any emails, uh, it's an excuse for dark soccer and I to talk about drag race.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:34.880
I'm still behind. I don't. Yeah. I don't think I have a lot to say. You do that. I will say

02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:38.960
this current season, this all-star six is, you know, for as much shit as it got for being on

02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:44.000
paramount plus as opposed to VH one. I think I understand now why they did this season,

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.480
because it's a really good season. It's probably the best all-star since two. I mean,

02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:52.240
ask me again when it's over. Cause it could have a shitty ending like all-stars three.

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:57.120
Uh, although I love the queen that won all stars three. I, we all hate how that last episode went

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.160
down. We all know it was, it just made everything look bad. Um, I think it took away from that

02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:07.280
queen's win, which is unfortunate. Um, but anyway, uh, so ask me when all-stars six is over,

02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:11.200
but so far it's on track to be one of like the better seasons, uh, of all-stars.

02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:15.440
So you'll have to check it out. All right. We'll make that quick discussion tonight.

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.320
Let's talk about other stuff. Uh, how about last minute stories? If you have any, um,

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:28.400
I do. So take two is removing some old grand theft auto mods using DMZ take down notices.

02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:34.960
This showed up on our discord. Yeah. Yeah. So they're doing that on mod DB. Um, there's several

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:40.320
pretty big and yet pretty old mods. Like for example, GTA Liberty city, which was a

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:46.160
toll conversion of vice city that brought, um, Liberty city from GTA three into the vice city

02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:51.360
engine, uh, GTA underground, which merged, I guess, several of the maps from different

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:58.800
games together. And those had received different takedown notices. Basically, it sounds like that

02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:03.840
the re they're going to re-release these games is what it sounds like to me, but, um, they've tried

02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:10.160
to do this in the past with other things. There was that whole, um, I think where they re reverse

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:16.720
engineered the code for, I think it was vice city or grant without three and basically, um,

02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:22.000
you know, where you built the games and poured on the different things. Um, so they had taken

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.080
it down at one time. And since the code was original, it was all based off of like kind

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:30.720
of figuring it out that, you know, they really couldn't do anything. So they put that back

02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:36.640
online. Um, but yeah, this isn't, this isn't the first time that they've tried to swing that

02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:41.200
around, but I mean, this stuff's been on the internet forever. It's probably not going to go

02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:48.160
away. All right. Not on a mod DB. So I'm going to do something a little different here that I

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:53.440
haven't done in a very long time. And maybe you can consider this a pilot of sorts for a particular

02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:59.200
feature here on the show to come back. Um, I'm going to do this live, but somebody wanted to

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:03.840
call in and talk to us tonight. And I think that is a lovely idea. So I would like to welcome to

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:09.520
the show tonight, our voiceover man, mr. Jason is with us tonight. Hi, Jason.

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.880
One of the few times that I get more than 13 seconds to endlessly,

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:21.360
uh, are you going on cam tonight or no? I did not think about it. No. For the sake of time. No.

02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:25.600
Then let me go back. Okay. Well, that's gonna, all right. That's fine. That's the joy of doing

02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:29.280
this live is that you have, uh, all that. All right. That's all right. We'll figure it out.

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:34.800
Uh, hi. Uh, so what is on your mind? Yes. I, I, and the listeners need to understand

02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:43.040
you. Thanklessly do the intro, the outro and all that stuff every week here on the show.

02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:46.720
So, you know what, if you've got something to say, well, God damn it, I'm going to make sure

02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:51.200
you get to come in here and say it because you know, you do so much for OLR. And I really hope

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:56.800
people understand that, um, O O L R really wouldn't happen the way it does if it wasn't for you. So

02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:03.120
yeah, I absolutely appreciate that. And I'm always willing to throw in however possible. And

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:07.120
a lot of my participation has been exactly that it's like, Hey, I want to see this thing better.

02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:13.600
So boom, let's do that. Um, I, I wanted to talk about, uh, a theme, like a lot of,

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:19.120
a lot of the intros I do are typically just for fun and I tend to avoid the headline because the

02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:22.480
headline is the most obvious thing. You're going to spend the most time on it. Everybody's heard

02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:25.600
about it. I don't need to use my time in that. So let's do something a little bit different.

02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:33.120
This week is the, uh, exactly as I said for E3, uh, you know, last month, the, uh, the,

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:37.760
the very quiet intro, making the joke about how I don't like repeating myself, which is a hundred

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:44.000
percent true thing about myself. Um, E3 is happening. Well, uh, you know, completely

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:49.280
unsurprising news of the week. Um, but like the theme of this night that was kind of running

02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:53.920
around my head has been really interesting too, because we talk that the continual evolution of

02:32:53.920 --> 02:33:01.520
gaming platforms and systems and everything else and our particular arrangement on it, you, Rob,

02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:08.400
you said the very same thing that I, that, that, that applies to me. I work from home.

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:18.160
If I commute, it's me driving. Um, I am intensely interested in the steam deck, but I don't know

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:24.240
where it fits in in my life. Um, because yeah, like my, my switch is generally docked. I don't

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:30.880
take it with me when I go somewhere because I'm the driver. Same. I'm I'm with you obviously.

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:36.480
Yeah. We're on the same page there. It's like, I don't do a lot. The most portable gaming I do

02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:41.520
is when I'm flying, when I'm on airplanes, when was the last time I got on a plane here in the

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:47.760
year 2021, it's been a long time. Now I am planning to attend dragon con. Um, that is still

02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:53.440
on the table. Um, as a vaccinated individual, I know what my risks are. I don't have children.

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:58.480
I'm not worried that if I were to somehow catch COVID during all this, you know, as a, again,

02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:04.000
being vaccinated, I'm going to be fine. I don't have any kids to pass it to. Um, I plan to hang

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.080
out with other vaccinated individuals at dragon con. I'm going to cut back on some of the big,

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:13.200
big stuff, uh, that usually happens. But anyway, my point is I'm going out there. I do plan to fly.

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:17.360
That's the only time I'll probably actually play the switch, not in docked mode. Uh,

02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:24.960
he's doing, and to sync sync multiple hundreds of dollars in for, uh, you know, not, not a one-off

02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:30.320
use, but by no means a regular use as a heck of an investment to make in that kind of a situation.

02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:33.760
Yeah. And so like, as I've gotten, as I've gotten more and more into, uh,

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:42.480
uh, big daddy businessman pants, um, it, it frustrates me to, to have the adult mentality

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:48.320
about it, that I want to know what steam's expectations are. And I think like, this is,

02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:53.520
this is why, um, journalists, non-investing journalists getting in and investor calls has

02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.880
been such a big thing. I want to know what their targets are because the actual number of people

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:07.920
that I expect to buy the steam, uh, the, uh, the steam deck at a given price point off being offset

02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:13.520
with how much of a certain skew they produce, uh, if they're taking a loss on the hardware,

02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:18.080
which they do because they have, you know, they have their, their cut of all of the gobs and gobs

02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:23.040
of software they sell. Um, like I want to know where their expectation is in order to

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:32.320
you expect the longevity of this device, because it is a subset of a subset PC gamers have PCs.

02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:39.280
I, you know, some people may, you know, uh, families, multiple kids, all this kind of stuff.

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:44.480
There's a, there's a place for playing it on TV and a big group playing it on the TV when the

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:50.400
computers otherwise in use, uh, school children, for example, those sorts of things. But that's a,

02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:56.880
you know, that's, that's a subset. And the second subset is people that don't already have

02:35:56.880 --> 02:36:02.560
consistent means of accessing something. Those people that today would go to a library,

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:07.520
which isn't conducive to gaming a land center, which is, but is less, you know, less available

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:15.280
around the U S and around the world. Um, it's, it's the target seems so small, but it is such

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:23.120
a compelling idea. You know, I do really like the concept of that. It's basically like an,

02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:26.960
especially in this day and age where we live in now where it's, it's impossible to get new graphics

02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:31.840
cards and some of these things, I kind of like that. It's almost like a, a, a entry-level PC

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:38.000
of sorts. Like I almost wonder if the steam deck wouldn't have a purpose as being a kid's computer

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:44.320
to do their homework on a relatively cheap way of doing that. I mean, okay. Yeah, you have,

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:49.040
you know, you can get a really cheap Chromebook to do a lot of that, I'm sure. But I like this

02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:52.960
as kind of like the net. Like we all know, like you get what you pay for with a hundred dollar

02:36:52.960 --> 02:37:00.080
laptop, you get a hundred dollar laptop. You're going to have the web Skype. You're not really

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:04.400
gonna play games on it, right? I like, this is kind of like a middle ground where it's like,

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:09.520
and you can play quite a few games too on this. It may not be top of the line. It may not be the

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:16.560
biggest graphics fidelity, but it kind of works as like a basic PC for a college kid or a high

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:22.480
school kid. I think that is very fascinating to me. Yeah. And then Jamie said the same thing,

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:29.040
me and her are completely in agreement about this. That like we being Linux using technically

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.760
sophisticated, technically, technically, technically broad and experimental individuals

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:40.720
could absolutely go to town on this for that particular. Yeah. And I've given some thought

02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:46.640
to SteamOS again today in lieu of these announcements, because I knew it used to be

02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:53.040
Debian based. I always mix up if it was Debian Ubuntu, but I only recently learned that they

02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.160
moved to Arch, which everybody is figuring is going to be what's going to be backing,

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:01.680
what's going to be backing the device physically when it comes out, assuming there is no big

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.240
other change since then in as much as a Linux distribution actually matters, blah, blah, blah,

02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:13.840
blah, blah. And so I completely agree with you with everything that you said, Rob, but reiterate

02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:19.440
that that's a subset of a subset. This is advertised to gamers. So for somebody to realize,

02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:24.400
oh, I can use this couple hundred dollar gaming thing for all of these other purposes.

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:28.080
If you would still need to buy a keyboard, you could, you probably are only going to use

02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:35.280
schoolwork stuff when docked on a screen to which conversely, yes, those cheaper laptops that are

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:42.640
actually laptops, general advertisers, general purpose exist. The pie for hundreds in particular,

02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:47.440
the the computer in the keyboard models, I have one. Those things are friggin superb.

02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:52.800
And they're even cheaper. I think it's important to say, though, that is all in the marketing.

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.960
And that would be things that they could bring up in year two and year three. For example,

02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:03.680
Beyonce did not appear in ads for the Nintendo 3DS the first year. No, they got her to do those

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:10.400
ads when that thing was already four or five years old to try to reach more people. In other words,

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:15.360
anybody who likes any type of music, because Beyonce is, you know, universal in the music world.

02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:19.680
But you get what I'm saying, like, you know, those types of like celebrity endorsements and things

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:23.920
like that, those don't come until you usually I mean, of course, I'm sure and chat, you're

02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:27.040
probably gonna say, but what about this? What about this? Yes, of course, there's exceptions

02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:31.520
to every rule. But usually those types of big celebrity endorsements and that expansion of,

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:38.320
you know, what is this for comes later in the cycle. So I think it's it's subcultural. It's

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:44.720
subcultural endorsement. Let's take an example. Tommy Tallarico. It's subcultural before it's

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:49.760
mainstream cultural when you have demonstrated your success, the value that you can provide in

02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:54.320
both directions. Yeah, absolutely. And that's that's the give and take like valve. What is

02:39:54.320 --> 02:40:01.280
when has valve ever marketed that you conversely to that valve markets through steam like have they

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:07.760
ever had a TV commercial like they could have a banner ad but outside of their service like where

02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:16.000
else do you hear about steam? Where else do you hear about valves products by valve outside of

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.880
steam? Um, I wonder there could there there could legitimately be answers to this. I don't

02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:28.320
I don't watch TVs. I use ad blockers. You know, I'm I'm actually I'm actually I'm legitimately

02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:33.200
asking this at large. I'm not expecting the direct answer from you. But like because I avoid

02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:38.320
advertisements like the plague. I am actually just not exposed to this kind of thing. And I'm a bad

02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:44.720
barometer for mainstream advertising. Um, I guess my quick answer to that is but you know about it.

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:48.400
So they got you somehow. No, they didn't get you through advertising. But you know about

02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:54.320
as I read because I read these new right. I'm in this community. They have the techies. They need

02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:59.440
to advertise in the non techie spaces when they're ready to recruit those people. I think that's my

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:04.080
short and sweet kind of response to that, I guess. All right. Um, I do want to answer this, though,

02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:09.520
because I actually you know, I love your chatters. The part of why you guys are here is so that we

02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:13.600
have diverse opinions and discussion and things like that. I'm going to say to this comment,

02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:20.320
I really disagree. And Rama, sorry, but it's you. Rama says, Oh, dang, I scrolled it off the

02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:23.360
screen. Now I've called them out. And then I don't even have the receipts here to read.

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:29.360
How did Oh, there it is. The steam deck is just Gabe thumbing his nose at Nintendo. Nothing else

02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:35.040
more. I super disagree with that statement, actually. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:42.080
And Rama, I will give you this. I do it is the steam deck a response of sorts to the Nintendo

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:48.560
Switch. Yes, that part I will agree. Did they think about the steam deck before they ever

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:53.120
saw a Nintendo Switch? I doubt it. Not in this form that it's in now anyway, they might have

02:41:53.120 --> 02:42:00.880
thought about like portable, you know, but they I think the switch paved the way for this to exist.

02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:07.280
That being said, go ahead, Jimmy. Just bear in mind also to research and development time.

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:13.200
Yes, that so it can't be a reaction to this new switch, it had to have been in process for a

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:20.320
while. That being said, if I'm at Nintendo, and I'm seeing this right now, I don't give a shit.

02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.520
Like I'm looking at this going, that's really interesting. But I remember they ever at the

02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:29.920
end of the day, they're not going to give a shit like and they didn't do that with the PSP or any

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:36.160
that other stuff. And the reason why is because let's not forget what Nintendo is very good at

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:43.200
making games. And Nintendo Switch is always going to be the only place you can play Mario,

02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:52.320
Zelda, Metroid, and all of those Pokemon. That is why now going back to what you are, you know,

02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:56.480
and giving again, I'm not like saying like, everything you say is wrong. I there there

02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:02.000
are elements of this that I do think work here, going back to what I said earlier. Now,

02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:09.760
this is why I am surprised. And if valve really was trying to punch Nintendo in the face here,

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:16.240
this is what you would have seen. This is why I'm surprised valve did not have the valve game

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:23.680
that is better on this thing that is not going to come out on Nintendo Switch ie portal three ie

02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:29.840
left for dead three ie half life three. There is no half life three you stupid slut.

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:43.120
Yeah, this whole this whole especially for for three hosts that have been doing a show for a

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:51.920
human's entire developmental life. Like we can we can take this conversation back endlessly. People

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:58.960
people see a steam link. Jesus. They see a stream dreck. Oh, I mean, God, these freaking words this

02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.880
week have been a nightmare. People see a steam deck and visually draw an immediate contrast to

02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:13.360
the switch. But the only thing that a steam deck is, is a steam controller and an untethered steam

02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:21.280
machine. This is not like, you know, a completely a completely copy paste job or new in the making

02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:26.880
development of valves own products. This isn't a new like this isn't a new development in the PC

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:34.720
series. There was a series of PCs back in the mid aughts. I think I even remember it in high school.

02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:40.800
There was a computer that was basically like a T T mobile sidekick a hip top sidekick called the

02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:48.320
O Q O. That was the same fucking thing with a physical keyboard. Even to this day, I saw

02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:54.240
somebody saying, hey, to to to denounce to downplay the oh, they're they're doing they're targeting

02:44:54.240 --> 02:45:01.040
Nintendo. The GPD win has existed for I actually don't even know how long I'm gonna I'm gonna say I

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:06.720
think they're already on the third iteration of that. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, so and Rama Rama's

02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:11.520
pushing back a little bit here and I understand I get it. And I want to bring in some of the same

02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:16.000
stuff you're bringing up Jason. So says Rama says in chat when the switch became this popular,

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
let's not forget that there are other manufacturers doing the same thing. I present

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.360
the Aya Neo and the GPD win two and three. So you're wrong, my friend. So here's the thing and

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.560
then goes on to say same thing, man, Nintendo created others want to copy. In that kind of

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:36.000
context, I think we do have some similar ground. But there's a difference in my opinion between

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:41.120
that and doing something to kind of like get at Nintendo or challenge Nintendo. Here's the

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:47.760
parallel that comes to my mind. I don't know who did it first. In my mind, it was Oreo that did it

02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:53.760
first. And let me explain what that is. What Oreo did first, I think, was they started putting out

02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.440
all of those fucking flavors. And I mean, a lot of fucking flavors. I mean, there's the Oreo

02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.240
peanut butter. There's the Oreo strawberry. There's the Oreos that taste like

02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:10.720
a s'mores. There's the Oreos that taste like carrot cake. They probably have ass Oreos at

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:17.680
this point for those. If you if you love ass, have an ass Oreo. That is probably a thing that exists.

02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:24.480
My point. Everybody saw what was happening with Oreo and was like, huh, that's a pretty good idea.

02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:29.280
Let's try that our way. They're not necessarily doing it to compete with Oreo. They're doing it

02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.960
to expand their own longevity. And what I'm talking about is breakfast cereals. Now you

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.760
go into the store and granted, of course, Nabisco is one of the cereal makers, so they probably

02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:43.520
stole from themselves. But you also have General Mills and other companies. And now it's oops,

02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:50.080
all berries, which is memed all the time now. Right. As a flavor or banana frosted flakes,

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:55.280
which is the fucking yummiest flavor thing I have ever had. Does it does it taste like the

02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:02.320
extinct Cavendish or like current bananas? It it tastes good. That's all I know is that

02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:09.520
and all of those other banana flavoring. Right. Yes. Now there's now there's wheat thins in all

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:15.600
sorts of different flavors. You name it. There's a million different flavors. And I kind of so. So

02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:21.920
my my comparison here is that I think it's more that valve saw Nintendo making a new,

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:27.280
making a new flavor here and going, huh, we should try doing what we do in a similar flavor.

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:32.880
But that's not to say that, oh, now you're no longer going to buy Oreos because you're going

02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:38.480
to buy this. I think it's that both can actually kind of coexist side by side for a lot of people.

02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:47.440
Say nothing of the DSP, the PS Vita. Yes. If you don't have if you've got the disposable income

02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:53.120
for it, buy whatever the fuck you want. End of story. Yeah. Yeah. Whoever, whoever,

02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:57.360
whoever was first, whoever was best, like all those arguments are always going to happen.

02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:01.920
And they're, they're, they're moot because in the grand scheme of things,

02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:08.960
the grand scheme of things is made up of every individual story and exactly as Jamie just said,

02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:15.600
get in it for you. Do what it is for you. You do have to calculate, you know,

02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.520
you do have to consider the longevity, you know, if this flops and steam discontinues it,

02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:27.680
what does that mean for breakage and repair? How long did I link my Engage? Let my Engage along.

02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:36.960
How long did Loki keep Azuya before he sold it off? Not long. I got it. I got to wrap up because

02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.840
we're almost to midnight, but I think that this steam deck conversation is certainly not going

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:46.160
away at the end of the day. I want to play one. I feel like there is a lot I'm saying here. That's

02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:51.360
just kind of like feeling, um, because I haven't had my hands on one yet. I feel like I can answer

02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:55.760
a lot more about how does it really compare to a switch once I actually play it right now. It's

02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.560
just thoughts anyway, Jason, great topic. Anything else you want to say before we let you go and wrap

02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:06.320
up the show tonight? We opine because we can't opine and we are here to provide insight and

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:13.120
consideration to people. A system is only good as the games that are on it. Your choice is your

02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:18.400
choice for your own reasons. You do the research. Jason, thanks so much for being on the show and

02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:24.240
thanks again for all you do. And I would say this pilot was a bit of a success. So for those of you

02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.160
that have been asking for this to come back, I think we'll have to look into that. So thanks,

02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.880
Jason. You take care. Are we making a note here? Huge success. All right. I'm going to pull you

02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:38.800
out of the chat. Take care, Jason. Later. All right. There we go. That worked out very well.

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:45.840
And at the end of the day, I only play fight with Rama. It's not a real fight. I play fight with

02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:51.680
Rama because he's one of my favorite people and I know I can do that with him. Let's see. Lots of

02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.800
great stuff in chat right now. The one other comment I wanted to read, because it is also

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:04.560
topical. It has to do with that comment about the Microsoft tweet as Joe and her map

02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:10.960
says. God damn it, it keeps going on the screen. Listen, the official Xbox Twitter account said

02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:16.560
this week to the people in our replies saying PS five is better. The best console is the one

02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:25.280
you enjoy playing. Have fun. That's a very. Exactly. It's such a different perspective

02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:32.400
on things than the days of Genesis does what Nintendo don't. It's now I feel like everybody's

02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.760
holding hands and singing. We're all in this together. And maybe that has to do. This has

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:44.160
to do something with maybe the state of the games industry where unfortunately layoffs, closures

02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:49.600
and change in the industry is so common that people really do create a big family of sorts in

02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:54.800
the game development industry where it's really about, you know, holding hands with each other

02:50:54.880 --> 02:51:05.760
and not necessarily. Wanting to fight. So anyway. Good, good discussion. I did see one other

02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:08.880
question chat that I thought was worth a quick, quick discussion before we wrap up tonight.

02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:12.960
No one special had asked, and I'm going to paraphrase here because it scrolled off the

02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:18.800
screen. But what is the worst game you have ever played? The worst video game you've ever played.

02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:24.000
And I thought that was a cute question. So WCW Thunder. And why was it the worst?

02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:29.440
Well, it was so bad that an hour after bringing it home,

02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:33.920
Dan and I turned around and took it back to blockbuster. It was that bad.

02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:36.720
Oh, yes, I remember that. I do. Hey, you stop it.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:48.560
Don't confuse the PC version with mobile, OK? The point I do taste isn't a lot of people I

02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:53.440
watch stream dead by daylight say this is that behavior gets away with a lot of shit.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:00.320
Like behavior is sometimes resting on those licenses that they have that, you know,

02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:05.120
create the multiverse of horror films and that that game is so fucking buggy. Sometimes they

02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:09.440
really do get away with a lot. So, yeah. Right. It's a crazy addiction.

02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:15.360
Tay says, I hate that fucking cursed game, but I can't stop playing it. That's a discussion for

02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:21.840
another week. What is a fucking cursed thing you can't stop doing? Whether that's playing a game

02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:28.880
or whatever it is. All right. Let's see. So so dark soccer, I know you're going to bow out so

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.840
you can set up for the post stream. Yeah. Anything last you thought you want to get

02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:39.120
out here while we give our own worst games and then wrap up here. Have your neighbors

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:44.320
spayed and neutered. All right. Thank you, Jamie. I wish I could sometimes,

02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:52.640
but it's already too late. No, just just find one person, just one person that you interact with

02:52:53.440 --> 02:53:00.000
and say something really kind to them. That's all do one kind act. OK, I want to see where it goes.

02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:05.040
All right. Take care, Jamie. Thanks for being here. We'll see you in a little bit.

02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.840
All right. Loki, do you have a worst game you've ever played?

02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:17.120
I'm sure I blocked it from my memory if I did. The only thing that sort of

02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:21.600
I can kind of vaguely remember Bullet Witch and that was terrible.

02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.160
That's the only one I could think of right now, because if it was so bad, I wouldn't remember it.

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:38.800
Fusion Frenzy two on the Xbox 360. Yeah, that is very terrible. Fucking garbage, hot Mario party.

02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:45.120
I thought it was going to be, but it was not garbage. That was a bad game. I remember some

02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:50.240
eight bit knockoff games, too, like from the companies that couldn't even get the actual

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:56.320
Nintendo seal of approval. I like Back to the Future two and three, because like I bought

02:53:56.320 --> 02:54:00.560
Back to the Future two and three because I saw like Nintendo Power Cover, like the original

02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:06.640
Back to the Future NES game. And those games were not like the Back to the Future one game.

02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:13.600
They were very different and not very good. My other answer and all my music game fans out there

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:16.480
and the roots of our show and everything, listen up, because I know you're going to agree with

02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:22.560
this answer. Worst game I've ever played? Beat and Groovy, the American version of pop music

02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:29.440
on the Xbox 360. Fucking terrible. Oh, yeah. Pop culture says Lollipop Chainsaw. You know,

02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:36.240
that game had it looked like it had potential, but yeah. All right. Let's wrap up and get

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:39.840
final thoughts and close up shop here tonight. Or actually, I don't know if you have any other

02:54:39.840 --> 02:54:42.320
last minute stories quickly, Loki? I don't.

02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.000
Okay. We're after nine o'clock anyway, which is midnight on the East Coast. So we do want

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.320
to wrap up. Final thoughts. We are at the end of the show. Thank you very much for tuning in.

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:57.200
And whether you participated with us live on Twitch, or if you downloaded our podcast on

02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:01.360
Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is you listen to podcasts, please help us spread the word.

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:04.640
Tell a friend about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:11.040
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, auto hosts on Twitch, they go an awful long way

02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:15.440
as well. And we really appreciate those. You don't have to, but if you feel so inclined,

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:20.640
check out the shop over at vognetwork.com slash shop. We have some Orange Dance Radio t-shirts

02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:24.320
and you can get some other merch for the Bobby Black Wolf show and VOG Network in general.

02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:28.720
And I'm sure more to come in the future. So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash

02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:33.520
shop if you are wanting some new threads or some stickers, lots of things in there.

02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:39.040
That's it. Let's get final thoughts tonight. Loki, your final thoughts.

02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:43.760
That's SSJ100. Matt says I got mad at some of the newer Saints Row games.

02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:47.680
I was more disappointed in them. Like they could have been so much better.

02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:54.960
Not necessarily mad. Now, probably if I played Agents of Mayhem, maybe I'd get mad. But no,

02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.760
it's just that they had so much potential. I'm so I'm very like, let me put it this way, the next

02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:03.920
Saints Row game Volition announces. I mean, I'm gonna buy it day one.

02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.680
I don't care what four turned out like. I'm obviously going to drop money for that whenever

02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:15.840
they announce that. And I will be happy to answer this question from Tay. What is the best way to

02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:20.160
financially support the show directly? Thank you for that. That's very kind that people would want

02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:24.480
to do that word of mouth and spreading the word. That's the number one thing we want. We've never

02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:28.320
asked for money from the beginning. But yes, I know there's still people that say, but we want

02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:33.520
to. And I really appreciate that. So yes, biddies and subs here on Twitch, like a lot of other

02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:38.480
streamers on that does go back into the network. And especially as we're talking about sponsoring

02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:45.120
conventions such as I believe VOG Network is sponsoring again, the Southern Fried Gaming Expo

02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:48.640
that's coming back in a few weeks as I know Bobby brought it up on his show tonight. And he's doing

02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:53.840
some panels there. And then as things start to come back on the West Coast, I'm hoping we can

02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:59.520
do that as well. And that's going to really get the word out as well. That goes a long way. So

02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:03.680
yes, biddies and subs and the shop is great too, because we do get a portion of those proceeds.

02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.840
And then what I like about that is that you get something too. You get a shirt, you get a sticker,

02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:12.400
you get whatever it is you want to buy. So honestly, any of those things we appreciate.

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:18.240
But yeah, word of mouth, bits, subs, it's all great. And we really appreciate it.

02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:24.720
VOG Network is a legit business and that isn't cheap to do if you believe it or not. So it's

02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:31.760
all because you have to pay for all the registration of your LLC and the PO box

02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:37.120
that we have and all the stuff that kind of goes into it. So appreciate that very much.

02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:41.120
And I'm really excited to get back out there and spread the word live at live events again.

02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:46.800
I cannot wait for the next TwitchCon, which is interesting because I haven't been in years. The

02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:50.720
first TwitchCon I went to kind of got me into wanting to do more Twitch streaming and live

02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:55.920
streaming. I can't wait to go again. So anyway, we really do need to wrap up. My final thought,

02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:02.080
that really kind of was a very long final thought, but I will also say I'm going to have, I will say

02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:07.440
this is the final thought. I'm having surgery in about 10 days. It's nothing major. It's nothing

02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:12.240
for you guys to be concerned about. I almost want to say it's a cosmetic procedure, but it's not.

02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:17.040
It's not like I'm getting Botox or anything. You can't really see it here, but I have a thing on

02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:21.200
the back of my neck and I've had it for years. And it's finally gotten to a point where it's

02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:25.040
a little bit sore. And so we're going to get rid of it. So it's a, it's an IC, but it's an easy

02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:28.560
thing. It's nothing to be concerned about, but still anytime you have surgery, it's kind of a

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:34.320
scary thing. So I appreciate any happy thoughts and all those sorts of things that you can send

02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:40.640
my way. So I appreciate that. All right. That's it. We're going to be back in seven days to do

02:58:40.640 --> 02:58:44.640
all again. Okay. Sound good. Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.
