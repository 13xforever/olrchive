16280	19820	has some new and improved accessories for you. Are you a gamer? Valve has a way for
19820	23440	you to play games away from your keyboard and outside of your home. Are you a fan of
23440	29240	Path of Exile? New content! Why does one have to win? Because life is a competition!
29240	32720	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about at least
32720	36120	two of these J-15 drops and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on
36120	37800	the show where every gamer has a voice.
37800	45880	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45880	52760	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again with episode
52760	60800	number 876 of our show for this July the 18th of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and
60800	65740	I am joined with you live as I am every week by my co-hosts. First off, say hello to the
65740	68000	one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68000	69000	Oh, hi.
69000	71000	Hi, how are you?
71000	72400	I'm alright. How are you?
72400	73840	Good. It was good to see you today.
73840	79120	Yeah, it was good to see you. I was up too early, but y'all were worth it.
79120	84960	So Pokemon GO Fest was this weekend. I guess I'll get into it now. So, you know, even though
84960	89220	I know some of y'all say dead game, it did celebrate its five year anniversary and it
89220	93960	does seem to have a lot of people still playing it and I'm one of them. And so those of you
93960	98160	that listen to the show, if it's your first episode of OLR, hi, welcome. We talk about
98160	102480	video games, but we talk about a lot of our lives and a lot of tangent trains and stuff
102480	106720	too. So it happens sometimes. And one of the conductors of a lot of those tangent trains
106720	111520	is our friend Shane, uh, that comes up on the show a lot. So, um, he was actually here
111520	117640	this weekend because the purpose was to go play Pokemon GO in San Francisco. And you
117640	121560	might wonder why on earth would somebody drive all the way from Idaho to San Francisco to
121560	127360	play Pokemon GO? Well, number one, it's Shane. He does things like that. Number two, it was
127360	132320	a nice, cool 65 degrees in San Francisco yesterday. Ask how hot it was.
132320	134440	Nice to meet his hubby too.
134440	139120	Yeah. Ask how hot it was here in Sacramento or Boise. It was not quite 97. Yeah. It was
139120	143720	very hot yesterday. So, uh, it was, it was great. Yeah. So this morning, uh, before they
143720	150440	set out back home, uh, we met up with dark Sakura for some, uh, crepes. It was good.
150440	156120	So uh, yes. And I still have my leftovers. Yes. And the nice thing about that too is
156120	160560	that if you notice for those, uh, listening or watching, I should say live on Twitch because
160560	165160	we are a podcast. We've had a podcast for a very long time on our podcast feed at orange
165160	169680	songs, radio.com. But, uh, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific
169680	174440	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black Wolf show at vog network, twitch.tv
174440	179840	slash vog network. And if you are watching on Twitch, then when I hold up this little
179840	186040	present that dark Sakura got for me, you can see what it is there. And maybe those of you
186040	190380	that have been listening to show for a little bit know why this is really funny. Um, because
190380	197280	I am holding up a figure of ketchup from animal crossing who was my BFF, uh, during the pandemic
197280	201640	because I had no other friends besides Alan during the pandemic. And I bought this for
201640	206560	you like last year. Yes. So you were finally able to give it to me today. Um, so that was
206560	211960	great. Love that. So let me put her back up here next to me. It's a delicate balancing
211960	216320	act there with sobble right next to her. Okay. There we go. Anyway, so yeah, it was
216320	221120	good to see you today. Um, and I see in chat over there, uh, there's a lot of cute and
221120	226360	so forth. Uh, darted CS says, OMG, ketchup plushie. I need one. Well, they're there,
226360	232920	you know, the internet is a big place and there's lots of things on it. All right. You're
232920	237600	welcome to DM me. One of those other things you will find on the internet is tech master
237600	243360	Loki also joining us. Hi Loki. I'm here on the internet. You are on the internet. What
243360	246960	you have quite a bit of internet playing behind you tonight. What in the world is that? It's
246960	252120	all of the internet, the entire internet. It's it's Marvel versus Capcom three because
252120	257440	we don't talk about infinite. That doesn't exist. You're right. What is that game? I've
257440	265600	never heard of it. Okay. So I thought I was good. Marvel versus Capcom game. You think
265600	269920	they'll do another one of those eventually? I hope it doesn't suck like infinite. Yeah,
269920	273400	but there's always those rumors that they're going to cook up another one for the current
273400	278600	generation of consoles. It got weird though. See like with infinite, like it got weird
278600	284520	because it was a lot of the MCU characters that they brought in there. So like I prefer
284520	289760	more some of these obscure characters in there. Like if they were like, for example, if they
289760	295320	were going to do like a, well, Marvel would, they would never do a Capcom DC fighting game
295320	299880	that would still be really awesome though. But like, you know, we want like star row
299880	306580	in there or something like that for a DC Capcom fighting game. But like, like, I like a like
306580	312080	Shuma graph and like all the, like even a lot of the Capcom characters are really awesome.
312080	317040	Like I, I liked that mix of those characters. I think that's great. So I would like, I would
317040	323720	like to see one more kind of akin to the Marvel versus Capcom three where it was still two
323760	330760	D ish and stuff, and maybe not, not do what they did with infinite. Yeah. A Marvel versus
330760	336240	DC fighting game is just never going to happen. It's literally see that it's literally as
336240	339920	likely as a street fighter versus mortal combat. In fact, I would argue street fighter versus
339920	343840	mortal combat is more likely because at least you're dealing with the studio's original
343840	350040	creations with those. But I, I always, I always have appreciated the irony that the studio
350080	356160	behind street fighter has Marvel and the studio behind mortal combat has DC injustice. Right.
356160	360000	So I've, I've always appreciated that irony. That's a good, and I, I like the injustice
360000	365480	games actually. That's probably, yeah. Ironically though, that is kind of just like how they
365480	369480	work with their movies as well. Like more as Marvel and a lot of their movies are kind
369480	373800	of tongue in cheek a little bit. Like some of them know how ridiculous they are and they
373800	380360	kind of throw a bit of comedy in there. Whereas DC takes their movies way too serious and
380360	388480	a little too dark sometimes, which is just like, um, so that's kind of like how they
388480	392520	were treated a little bit with like their, you know, injustice games and stuff like that.
392520	397640	It's, it's less funny and more like this is serious fighting. You know, it, it needs to
397640	402440	be a little ridiculous. We need to go more suicide squad, like a suicide squad fighting
402440	406360	game would be a great game, but like, those are some of the characters I'd like to see
406360	410280	in a fighting game, something like that, you know, a bit more ridiculous. There was very
410280	414320	recently a tweet by, I think it was Ed Boon or something. Maybe it was the studio itself
414320	421160	that pretty much said mortal combat 11 is done. It we're now at the end of, uh, I don't
421160	425960	want to say support, but end of a cycle basically for Mortal Kombat 11, meaning no more DLC,
425960	428840	no more costumes, no more. There's no more to look forward to Mortal Kombat 11. It's
428840	432920	all out there, but I bring that up because that makes it very obvious that nether realms
432920	439480	move on to their next game, which we all assume is injustice three, but there's other directions
439480	444840	they could go. Um, they haven't announced anything official yet, so who knows? Right.
444840	450520	Um, going into our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, a pod culture says the injustice
450520	455880	games are awesome. Uh, break man says injustice are good games. The justice justice league
455920	460920	fighting game was so bad. Uh, break man also says, I want someone to make celebrity death
460920	465560	match into a video game. I think it was, wasn't off. They did. It was on the PlayStation.
465560	469980	Yeah. Early on. It wasn't very good. It's PlayStation or PlayStation two, but they did
469980	474500	have a celebrity death match game. They did. And they, they had to get only certain celebrities
474500	478960	that would release their likenesses. So they kinda, they were, they were really a scraping
478960	485000	by on that, but yeah, it's, it's not a good game. So you forgetting it is okay. Um, and
485040	488600	then tiger class pointing out, there is a teenage mutant Ninja turtles versus justice
488600	493160	league fan game. And I was going to say, as far as the mortal combat and street fighter
493160	498160	game collides go, um, that fan games, that's what you're going to get. Uh, what is that
498160	503520	Mugen or what is that thing? Everybody like the fighting game multiverse. Yeah. That's,
503520	508360	that's as good as you're going to get for that stuff is actually a really good emulator.
508360	514160	And I would say Mugen probably is better than some of like the, what you'll get with some
514160	518560	of these other games, as far as like Marvel versus Capcom infinite. I think they would,
518560	522600	yes, I would think that they would treat their character like, cause you have fans making
522600	527000	these characters. So I think they would treat them, you know, with a little bit more respect.
527000	531640	Um, just, you know, never go up against any fast food mascots or anything like that. Cause
531640	535040	you're just going to get destroyed though. And Superman has nothing on Ronald McDonald.
535040	541480	So that's right. I remember that. Yikes. All right. Anyway, uh, let's talk about, uh, the
541480	546480	news. There was a surprising amount of news this week. So, um, Jason very tongue in cheek
546480	549960	there in the intro, there was talking about J 15 and we were kind of texting before the
549960	556240	show and he said, you know, it's like E3, but on July 15th, it's J 15. And I'm like,
556240	561240	honestly, I get it. Like there was a surprising amount of like just big news drops all in
561240	564960	the same day this week. And I don't know what that's about. I don't know if that's just
564960	569040	companies that didn't really participate in E3 kind of doing their own thing. If it's
569040	573840	just, this is, you know, mid July seems like a good time as any to announce stuff is that
573840	578480	as they, their project planning it out there, their Microsoft project document that tracks
578480	583480	them from, you know, the, the concept to release, they just all landed on July 15th. But there
583480	588360	was just a lot of stuff this week. Let's start off tonight talking about the big one. And
588360	591280	I think a lot of people are talking about this and, uh, whether they're going to get
591280	595960	one or not. Uh, Loki, please, what was the big unveil this week?
595960	601840	So the big unveil this week was the steam deck. It is a, Oh, I have a stream deck right
601840	608000	here. I'm ahead of the curve. Oh no, not the stream deck, a steam deck. So it is a handheld
608000	613360	PC that kind of resembles a little bit of the form factor of a Nintendo switch. It's
613360	618920	got, you know, built in, uh, joy six and it's got a, I think it was like a seven inch screen,
618920	624960	um, with, uh, it's an OLED screen as well. So, uh, you've got that and then it's unpacking
624960	632360	an AMD processor and APU. It's a Zen to our DNA to, uh, processor. And, uh, they've also
632360	636600	got this cool, unique kind of a combination of thumbsticks. And then they add these like
636600	642800	micro track pads underneath the thumbsticks, which is kind of cool. Um, so yeah, they've
642800	647480	got that altogether. Uh, they're offering it with three different like storage sizes
647480	652560	and stuff like that. So you can get, I think 64 words to, I think maybe half a terabyte
652560	660460	or two 56, um, gigabytes, but yeah, it's, um, looks pretty cool. Uh, yes, we've, we've
660460	666160	all heard that joke by now that valve has announced the, um, switch pro. So yes it is.
666160	670840	But um, when it comes to competing with Nintendo, which is the instant comparison people want
670840	674640	to make is that, Ooh, valve wants to throw down with the Nintendo switch. I'm kind of
674640	682120	like act. I honestly don't see two different companies doing such different things. I think
682120	686680	there's something to be said about the success of the switch leading valve down this road
686680	692840	of could we maybe possibly, but let's also be real. This isn't the first time that a
692840	696840	company has taken a look at doing like a portable PC like this, right?
696840	700920	This is like this right here though. I'm going to tell you, I didn't mention this on Twitter,
700920	707640	but I wanted to, this right here is going to be a fan. Well, hopefully a fantastic because
707640	712240	I don't know how the, all the games are going to rent, but potentially a very fantastic
712240	719240	game pass X cloud system, a portable X cloud system, because I mean, really all that's
719240	723520	going to be streaming anyways, at least with X cloud. And I'm not really sure how much
723520	730760	of the game pass stuff that this will be able to run, but I mean, it's pretty good at least
730760	734960	potentially on paper. It could be good. Yeah. You know, um, we were having a little discussion
734960	739800	on Twitter and my kind of initial reaction to it is, you know, in theory, it sounds really
739800	744600	good. I want to see how it really performs. Like I need to get my hands on one personally
744600	749480	to try it because I really want to see like, how well do those games perform on this device?
749480	753660	And there's, I have a lot of questions in that regard. Um, I'm also not sure this is
753660	759640	really for me because I don't play a lot like on my switch 95% of the time I'm playing docked,
759640	763500	I'm not playing portable. I already have a docked PC. You know what I mean? So I'm not
763500	768020	sure this is for me, but that's, that doesn't mean I'm a hater. Cause I think there's a
768020	775260	lot of unique concepts here where I do have some concerns is that a lot of steam's comparable
775260	780260	hardware is kind of flopped out the gate. I'm talking about steam machines. I'm talking
780260	784820	about the steam link was a huge flop. Uh, the steam controller, it was actually giving
784820	790900	those away. It was the controller was great, but it flopped. Yeah. And the steam controller
790900	795060	was a bit odd. This is a little bit more traditional, like layout wise. They do have
795060	799180	the additional track guys, which are kind of cool, um, that you can optionally use if
799180	804340	you want. Um, the additional thumb or the additional buttons on the back of the controller
804340	808020	are pretty cool. Uh, kind of like a lot of the pro controllers that they have out now,
808020	811300	I think where this differs from, like say the steam link is the steam link was kind
811300	815700	of ridiculous in the sense that you needed a PC running this. This is more of like, I'm
815700	820820	going to set up, you know, this on my TV in the living room and play games from my
820820	827260	PC on my TV in the living room. And not a lot of people really did that. Um, whereas
827260	832980	this is its own thing. It's its own PC. And not only that, they're like, listen, it's
832980	836700	meant for steam, but you can do whatever you want with it. It's a PC. I mean, if you want
836700	840660	to put Epic games store on there, go right ahead. Go put GOG on there, go right ahead.
840660	844900	You want to, you know, dump the steam OS on there and throw windows on there. Do whatever
844900	848820	you want, like put emulators on it. We don't really care. I mean like that. It's just,
848820	853060	it's a PC. Well, dark Sakura, you and I were chatting before the show that there's, there's
853060	859340	some things this device can't do that people are finding, right? Yeah. So basically there
859340	866860	are some, uh, games that aren't going to run at all, or if not, if they do run the not
866860	875300	very well. Um, and the thing is, is, I mean, this is basically a Linux machine, right?
875300	882620	Linux hasn't always had the best track record for video games either. Right. Um, they're
882620	888900	using, um, this, uh, this feature that's called proton. Um, that's basically like a combination
888900	895700	of wine and DXV, VK, sorry, that are basically emulators writers to play through the Linux
895700	902220	ecosystem. So it prevents you from having the port, the game to Linux. It just makes
902220	906320	it run. But of course it's far from flawless. And I mean, keep in mind, remember when I
906320	911100	had my little net book that was running Linux and I used to play Ragnarok on it? Yeah. That
911100	916060	was a pain in the ass to set up. I still use wine on my Mac. You were really big on that
916060	919700	Linux mint for awhile. I had never heard of that until you came to this show and you were
919700	923940	like, Oh, Linux, man, I love it. You should get a laptop and run it. It was really friendly.
923940	927280	And the good thing about it is if, you know, your hard drive goes out on your machine,
927280	933420	you can always plug in a flash drive with Linux on it and run it off that. Um, but anyway,
933420	942820	um, there, uh, there's a group called proton, uh, that, uh, they basically track proton
942820	949460	instances called proton DB. It says four of steam's 10 biggest games, uh, won't, won't
949460	955600	work or they'll, they'll start up and crash or they'll play for a bit and fail or they
955600	961420	just won't launch. Um, and those games are destiny to apex legends, rainbow six siege
961420	968820	and, uh, uh, uh, player in a battleground. Um, and the direct quote is that they are
968820	974980	borked. Um, um, go ahead. There's a good chat comment though, on all of these same lines.
974980	981340	Well, the, according to the reports, it happens because the anti cheat systems in those games
981340	988140	don't play well with photon. And so they're getting, um, instantly booted for multiplayer
988140	995300	servers. So, and of course valve is saying, um, we're vastly improving protons game compatibility,
995300	999900	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So that would that impact dead by daylight? Cause I know
999900	1005940	that's the game you'd want to play on this. Uh, well, yes, along those same lines. So
1005940	1009620	we have a comment here from chief tattooed officer, which I don't think I've seen. Uh,
1009620	1013440	so welcome, uh, in chat who says I'm a Linux user, so I'm pretty familiar with what will
1013440	1019180	and won't run. The biggest issues are the two anti-cheat vendors, battle eye and EAC.
1019180	1023180	So, and I bet, I bet Danuvo was on that list too. Let's just put them on the list cause
1023180	1027920	I'm sure it's screwing everything up as well. Uh, a chief tattooed officer continues valve
1027920	1031840	is working with battle eye and EAC to try to get them to support proton, but nobody's
1031840	1036160	sure if it'll be out by the time it releases. So, and those, you know, those games you named,
1036160	1042120	those are all pretty big deals there, at least as far as like, you know, the, the big, uh,
1042120	1046480	multiplayer bonanza type of games. So you can assume any of those big multiplayer bonanza
1046480	1050520	games are gonna have some type of anti-cheat in it. And that's the thing. Yeah, they've
1050520	1055920	got to work out. Um, that all being said, you know, again, I said this thing isn't for
1055920	1061300	me, but I have friends who plunked down that five bucks in a heartbeat because, you know,
1061300	1065880	they're on transit an hour a day, you know, they, their lives are just configured differently
1065880	1072400	where they do have more time for portable gaming. And honestly, yeah, if that were me,
1072400	1078480	hell yeah, to be able to play my PC games on the go, that would be incredible. Um, it's
1078480	1083600	like, and in that way, sorry, in that way, it compliments the switch to me. It's kind
1083600	1087760	of like why you own a switch and a X-Box or in a place, a PlayStation or whatever in
1087760	1092400	the first place is that you're not going to get Nintendo games on a steam deck, but there's
1092400	1095520	a lot of stuff on a steam deck. You're not going to get on the switch. Anyway, sorry,
1095520	1100940	Jamie. I'm wondering that since it's basically running, um, in Linux, if there's not going
1100940	1108040	to be like an OS port for that build, you know, that I could install on a partition
1108040	1117520	somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. You know, um, or if I would be able to, I guess like window link
1117520	1125240	so that I could, you know, it's just different things. It makes me think that the virtualizers
1125240	1133080	that are being used once they are up to, up to par, if I would be able to run something
1133080	1140600	like that on my Mac, because Mac and Linux are both built on Unix and therefore are
1140600	1145500	basically cousins of each other by operating system. You can probably just partition and
1145500	1151560	run dual operating systems. You can't, not on an M1 Mac. No, I'm talking about on the
1151560	1158180	steam link. On the steam link? Still wouldn't suit my purposes. Well, but, um, we, we were
1158180	1161640	talking, um, earlier in the week after this was announced and you, you kind of thought
1161640	1165760	that, you know, I, I was very much of the mindset, like, ah, I got to wait until I get
1165760	1169760	my hands on one myself to make the use case scenario. I'm not going to go in, um, sight
1169760	1174640	unseen on this, but I think it's interesting. And so I want to see more, but I want to actually
1174640	1179640	see one, but dark soccer, you weren't kind of like, Hmm, Hmm. I can see, Hmm. You know,
1179640	1183360	at least, you know, I don't know if that's still your mindset when it comes to, if you
1183360	1190320	personally might get one of these or not, but, um, my perspective on it shifted a little
1190320	1199640	bit when, um, this, uh, lovely motherboard arrived, wink, wink, you know who you are.
1199640	1206760	Um, so I'm actually still considering, um, rebuilding my, um, my piece. I mean, my PC
1206760	1214280	works. It just doesn't work well. Um, so I'm going to gut it, rebuild it, um, and probably
1214280	1222280	hook it on a KVM switch so that I can run what I need to, to stream off of that one.
1222280	1226360	Like if I want to play Mass Effect, but already Mass Effect is starting to work on windows
1226360	1232640	arm. So I might not need to do much with that PC right now. I'm still having the best time
1232640	1236160	playing dead by daylight on stadia. It would just be nice to be able to change my name
1236160	1242400	at random. Um, chief tattooed officer continues in chat. The biggest thing I think is if someone
1242400	1247080	wants to do a triple a multiplayer game, uh, like apex anti cheat is going to kill
1247080	1252080	that market and I don't personally think it'll be fixed. I agree with you on the first half.
1252080	1256600	I'm not sure I completely agree with you on the second half. Like I, I get that train
1256600	1262320	of thought, but I'm also of the mindset where it's like if this thing sells cuckoo bananas
1262320	1266040	and let's say tons of people want to pick up the steam deck and tons of them end up
1266040	1272280	selling, then you know what? If the companies want to sell their games on steam for the,
1272280	1276160	you know, to be played on these things, they're going to find a way to make it work and they
1276160	1279640	may push back with the anti cheat companies. I, that's not something that's going to happen
1279640	1284540	overnight and I think that is, that is definitely where I agree in this concept is that that's
1284540	1289840	going to take time and I think steam deck perspective owners should be well aware to
1289840	1295240	play things like apex, et cetera. You could be talking a couple of years before all that
1295240	1301200	shit is sorted out for the record. Yeah. Mass Effect legendary edition does play in proton
1301240	1307040	6.8 g two. Huh? How about that? I went looking it up so I, because I was still going to see
1307040	1313720	if I could play it through wine and uh, it says that it plays in proton. So we'll see.
1313720	1317400	Um, Zen monkey 11 and chat says valve sucks at mass production, so they'll never have
1317400	1321720	enough of them. Yeah. I was looking on the, it said the preorder, like if I wanted one
1321720	1326280	is already out to quarter two of 2022. So it's, you know, it's going to be awhile if
1326280	1330960	I decide if this is for me or not and that's okay. Um, how about the way they all set that
1330960	1335240	up though? Because I've been seeing a lot of articles about, Oh, there's already people
1335240	1340360	on eBay that are trying to scout these things for a shit ton of money. I feel like as far
1340360	1345220	as how they did the preorder, like everything again. Yeah. Like how you have to have an
1345220	1350280	existing account, how they charged you $5 upfront and limited you to one. I thought
1350280	1355440	that was a pretty intelligent way to do it. Um, now granted, I understand the system really
1355440	1359040	shit the bed as everybody was trying to get in there. One of my friends said he was on
1359040	1363440	that reloading screen for like nine hours before it finally went through. Like it was
1363440	1369040	crazy. Um, but so that part could have been better as you know, but maybe that also speaks
1369040	1374780	to valve really underestimated the demand for this thing. Um, so that, that could be
1374780	1380000	very interesting in that regard, but I, you know, of course there's going to be, you know,
1380000	1385000	scalpers and, and opportunities, Caesars that sneak through. Um, and so that's where the
1385000	1391200	eBay stuff comes from. But you know, I do like that you can still go and get one on
1391200	1397720	steam at the retail price. You just will be waiting a little bit. I, I don't hate that.
1397720	1403200	I think that's, I wish they did graphics cards that way. I wish they did Nintendo Amiibo
1403200	1407120	that way. There's a lot of things I wish they would do that way so that, you know, if I'm
1407120	1411040	willing to wait, at least I'll get one of it. I wish PS fives have been done that way,
1411040	1418620	quite frankly. So I don't, I can't really knock what steam is doing outside of, okay,
1418620	1424000	it shit the bed the day they unveiled it. But you know, I, I'm sure you could prepare
1424000	1428740	for worst case scenario and it still is somehow even worse. So I'm going to give them a tiny
1428740	1431400	bit of slack on that. Uh, Loki, I know you're trying to chime in.
1431400	1438360	No, not really. I mean, I, I didn't end up bidding or not bidding, uh, going in for a
1438360	1443560	pre-order on one, just because I don't know what I'd even run on it. I mean, like I've
1443560	1447680	got a PC that I pretty much use all the time. It would just be like, I guess, playing games
1447680	1454800	of the living room, which is like 10 feet away. Um, it would probably just be Minecraft.
1454800	1461440	So like, I don't know, like, I don't know, like why it would spend $600 for another device
1461440	1467600	to play Minecraft. Not as good as my computer. This, um, I don't know. I mean, I have a huge
1467600	1471900	library of games. I could definitely play on it. It's just, I thought about like my
1471900	1477540	son's looking for a computer, but like, yeah, I just, I I'd rather get like a laptop or
1477540	1478880	something for that kind of money.
1478880	1484480	Hmm. Uh, did your MS and chat points out steam deck listings have been pulled from eBay due
1484480	1488240	to the fact that they violated the TOS. Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Follow up. That's
1488240	1493680	interesting. Uh, meanwhile, Metroid dream listings are still up. Well, it's like whack-a-mole.
1493680	1498140	You knock them down and they come right back up. So it's, it's that, uh, as Joe and Hunter
1498140	1501120	Matt says, I thought it was interesting that Gabe Newell said his biggest issue with the
1501120	1505680	steam deck is the price. They really wanted it to be a consumer friendly price, but they
1505680	1509920	wanted to provide a good amount of performance for this, that the consumer will enjoy. And
1509920	1514120	is it par with current high powered tablets and gaming devices, which I respect. Yeah.
1514120	1517920	I think they did all right with the price, you know, maybe they were, I think they did
1517920	1522240	fine with the price. They might've wanted to be a little more competitive. Um, you can't
1522240	1527360	have it the same price as like a Nintendo switch and expect a performance that it has
1527360	1533520	in there. Like you just can't have both worlds there. You have to have, you know, what it's,
1533520	1537920	it's got to cost what it's going to cost. I mean, I think the timing though, that the
1537920	1542400	announce was great. It's like you get this announcement about the Nintendo switch OLED.
1542400	1545680	Everyone's disappointed and it's like, Oh, Hey, well, we got this. If you're interested
1545680	1550920	in something a little more powerful. Um, so that timing was great, but I really think
1550920	1554400	that was coincidental though. I don't think valve could have planned that. That may have
1554400	1560040	been, um, it had to be because they, they were preparing their system, their backend
1560040	1566720	for something, even if, again, it didn't hold up, they had to prepare it for this, you know,
1566720	1571560	so I, this isn't something where Gabe is sitting in his evil lair at the top of valve headquarters
1571560	1578320	going, I see the Nintendo pre-orders were a failure. What? Said scratching off all the
1578320	1582720	threes on the calendar. Exactly. Like, I, I just don't think that's how it played out.
1582720	1587800	I think it was a bit coincidental in that regard. So, um, yeah. And I said, you want
1587800	1591640	her, Matt also points out, especially in the chip shortage era we're in. I wonder how many
1591640	1597480	people are buying these machines to farm a doge coin and Bitcoin and all that stuff.
1597480	1604260	There's no GPU. I mean, there's an APU, but there's no like there's it. That would not
1604260	1610540	be a very good use of that. Uh, all right. Uh, any other comments on the steam deck before
1610540	1615100	we move on with the show? I it's, it's, it's interesting. Oh, I actually, there was one
1615100	1618500	of the little thing I want to get into because it is interesting to see valve. Like it's
1618500	1625100	like, oh, there's what about valves been up to outside of VR. So here's that steam deck.
1625100	1630200	And I still kind of firmly believe this point is that if valve really wanted to push that
1630200	1635800	steam deck one step further, I really think they should have announced a game with it.
1635800	1639620	I think they really should have announced like that new valve product. That's going
1639620	1643040	to be playable on the steam deck. And I'm not saying they have to make it exclusive
1643040	1647080	to the steam deck. I think that would have pissed a lot of people off, but just imagine
1647080	1654200	the power of the first portal three, I'm completely making shit up. We all know valve is allergic
1654200	1660600	to three. Hear me out here. Imagine the power of the first portal three screenshots being
1660600	1666340	in the context of a steam deck and what that would do for demand. That would sell so many
1666340	1673040	of them. Exactly. So I'm kind of shocked valve didn't take that easy opportunity because
1673040	1676240	again, and I guess portal three is one of those things, you know, again, obviously I
1676240	1681880	love portal. I want to see that series continue. Portal is also something that I truly believe
1681880	1687040	is impossible in VR and should not happen in VR. So it's not something where I'm like,
1687040	1692640	I still want it to happen. I know you do, but I, I think realistically it shouldn't.
1692640	1697360	So I don't know. Like, like you have to try some of the like more, like there's a lot
1697360	1701640	of VR games that like where you think like an FPS or something like that wouldn't work,
1701640	1708040	but they do like, I don't know. But I think the steam deck would have been a great place
1708040	1712020	for a portal three type of thing. And again, I'm not saying make it exclusive. I don't,
1712020	1715340	and I don't think Val's interested in going down that route, but again, I'm just saying
1715340	1721640	the power of the messaging. Imagine that, you know, it's, it's like how steam launched
1721640	1726160	alongside half-life two. Now granted that pissed a lot of people off at the time, but
1726160	1731420	people have generally gotten used to it. So there are, and portal two was kind of coupled
1731420	1737100	with that thing where steam was on PlayStation. Like a lot of people forgot that was a thing
1737100	1742460	that happened is that your steam account kind of ran on PlayStation, but it kind of
1742460	1747060	quickly disappeared, you know, um, that a whole thing, that whole mess got screwed by
1747060	1751740	what the PlayStation hack had happened right around that same time. And so a lot of that
1751740	1758240	got lost. So, um, yeah, so I just, I, I really think that was a missed opportunity by valve.
1758240	1765600	And I'm just curious, like, where's the software, although there was half-life Alex, which is
1765600	1770800	as many folks have pointed out that that is half-life three. It's just, they weren't
1770800	1776820	willing to put the number three next to VR only. And I understand and respect that decision,
1776820	1781800	but for all intents and purposes, half-life Alex is half-life three. Um, and they put
1781800	1786760	that with the VR. So I'm just, again, I'm just kind of surprised we're not seeing software,
1786760	1792160	you know, especially because it has been such a dry well out of valve in the software department.
1792160	1797520	So of course then people are going to say, but the card game, but Dota 2, but it's kind
1797520	1805340	of like, but the stuff, that stuff I'm interested in. So, all right. That was the only other
1805340	1810400	thought I wanted to get out was, you know, what about the software and you know, what
1810400	1816200	else is valve working on over there? But it is nice to at least see this. Yeah. All right.
1816200	1820400	Let's get into how was our gaming weeks? What have we been playing portal this week or what
1820440	1825920	have we been playing? Let's get into our gaming weeks and we'll start with dark Sakura. Um,
1825920	1831600	dead by daylight and word scapes and my world cup soccer is back home. So I played world
1831600	1838280	cup soccer. The pinball machine. Yes. Nice. Like there's no other world cup soccer that's
1838280	1841920	worth talking about. I still want to come over and play pinball sometime. It's been
1841920	1847640	too long. Okay. I need to do that. Hey, I should be, well, I'm streaming tomorrow night,
1847720	1850760	but if you want to play pinball while I'm streaming, feel free. We'll figure it out.
1850760	1855600	We'll figure it out. So yeah. Um, yeah. And I'm going to be gone this weekend, but we'll,
1855600	1861280	we'll figure out a weeknight or something. Have a play date. It'll be fun. Um, all right.
1861280	1867280	Uh, so Loki, how was your gaming week? Uh, it's all Minecraft. That's what it was. No,
1867280	1872400	it's still working on issues with the service. Still trying to get my latest episode out. Um,
1872880	1879360	I've been going through just, um, I have to change and pivot a little bit on what I want to do for
1879360	1887920	content wise, just because of the lack of people on the server. And I've been exploring options
1887920	1893760	at the end of the season where I may be going. And, uh, but in the meantime though, I want to
1893760	1901920	get into more, um, complex things with my content. And so that's kind of slowed things down a little
1901920	1908080	bit, unfortunately, I'm still going through and also hardware issues because since everything
1908080	1915120	updated the one 17 one and one 17, um, a lot of the mod makers out there, especially the stuff
1915120	1920080	that has to do with performance, like off the fine and all those they're kinda, it takes time
1920080	1925600	to get that all updated. And so things haven't been running as great, but I finally Iris updated
1925600	1929520	and I was able to update to that. And so now I have shaders and it looks nice and everything,
1929520	1935680	but it doesn't play nice with, um, replay mod, which is what I use. And so if I want to render
1935680	1944000	with shaders, it's extremely slow. Like I, it took normally it takes about like 10, 15 minutes
1944000	1951040	to render out a, a time-lapse or whatever of, you know, several hours, um, obviously sped up,
1951040	1956960	but it took like two hours to render it out instead because just off the fine is just garbage
1956960	1964640	right now. Um, so it, I don't know, we had more people leave the server, so that was fun. Um,
1964640	1970720	so I'm taking over some shops, I think. So that'll be coming soon, but there's to kind of
1970720	1974720	not spoil it too much. Cause I only tease at the end or I'm planning to tease at the end of this
1974720	1980240	next episode. Um, I think my content is going to get a little bit more into like the role-play
1980240	1984640	type of scenario. So going to be introducing like a storyline that goes along with everything
1984640	1990560	because I don't have people to interact with on the server. Like everyone's on vacation and it
1990560	1994720	like literally the last two weeks, it's been just myself on there for a lot of it.
1994720	1998720	Um, there's some people coming back and playing and stuff, but I never interact with these people
1999600	2004640	at any point. They're like AF Kane or something like that. So I need to become creative and figure
2004640	2008480	something out. So I want to get into, um, more of a storyline things. I think that'll be more
2008480	2016880	engaging with my audience. And then also, uh, animation would be kind of cool. I don't know
2016880	2021120	how come, how hard that's going to be. So I, that's something I need to explore as well,
2021120	2026480	which will also take some time. Um, but I do have some ideas of content I'm going to be working on.
2026480	2032240	I really am trying to get this last episode out. It just took so long to like build everything in
2032240	2036960	over the last couple of weeks that that's all the content is just a time-lapse of that. And
2036960	2041440	so I need to kind of build it up a little bit for this episode to come out, but I'm trying to
2041440	2047520	get it down to one week at, you know, per episode, but it's, it's been about two weeks now and that's
2047520	2053760	frustrating because I want it to be quicker, but I'm figuring out new ways to advertise and stuff
2053760	2059120	like that. New places to kind of promote myself. So it's just been all content creation stuff,
2059120	2063600	really. That's what I've been doing this week, but, um, mainly Minecraft. I haven't really
2063600	2069120	been playing anything else. Got my kids, um, the new Zelda game, but, uh, yeah, I really want to
2069120	2073440	check that out. That's that's what all my friends are doing right now. It's all like my social media
2073440	2078240	feeds are all Skyward sword. And I'm sorry to say that that was not a part of my week this week,
2078240	2082640	but maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll jump into it next week, but I kind of, I want to finish
2082640	2088640	the koozas still. So I don't know. Yeah. I need to go and play games other than Minecraft at some
2088640	2094480	point, but like, um, that's all right. I know I like it. I like what I'm doing, but like,
2094480	2099920	it is frustrating. YouTube's are in some ways harder than Twitch because it's not just
2099920	2105680	broadcasting it live. It's recording it. Then you got to go back and edit it. That's the thing.
2106480	2111440	And the problem with the stuff I'm, I'm still over scoping everything again. So like,
2111440	2116720	I look at like, I kind of compare myself to a lot of like what the Hermitcraft folks are doing. So
2116720	2122800	like their projects aren't nearly as the size that I'm doing. Like the, the build I just did
2122800	2128080	this week was like something that they would have taken four to six episodes to probably complete,
2128080	2133280	or, you know, worked on it a little bit at a time. Like it is too large, but I needed it to
2133280	2138160	be large because I need to get exposure and I need to do grand things in order to get everybody's
2138160	2141920	attention. And that's the problem is I'm pushing myself too hard to do that. So because all my
2141920	2148000	builds are really huge and really complex and the redstone's only going to get more complex.
2148560	2153760	So it's, it's hard to cram that all in there. Plus also like these guys are doing it full time.
2153760	2159760	Like I, I I'm restricted with the amount of time I can work on it. And so that's also another thing
2159760	2164960	that sets me back. So I can't, can't do all that. Now, if I just did live stream stuff, that works
2164960	2169280	for some things. And I know the type of scenarios that I could live stream and start getting into
2169280	2176000	that as well, but it's just, I just, I, I can't really do that right now. So I'm just gonna keep
2176000	2181680	working at it. All right. Going to our chat, cause sometimes over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
2181680	2186960	when we are broadcasting our recording on Sunday nights, some of you like to share your gaming
2186960	2192160	weeks. And I see Black and Pat has responded, which by the way, do me a favor, click on Black
2192160	2196320	and Pat, and please ensure that you are following that channel. Thank you very much. Black and Pat
2196320	2200480	says I've been playing Hella Slime Rancher. See, that's another one of those games. And I do,
2200480	2204320	I have watched people play that on Twitch and I'm like, oh, I should play this. This looks fun.
2204320	2209200	And then I just, oh, but shiny something else gets my, oh, I need to grind in Dead by Daylight
2209200	2215440	or whatever it is. It's something else. I know I do. I know I have it. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So
2216080	2221520	anyway, um, that's Joan Hunter Matt lending some video editing expertise here. When making a video,
2221520	2226080	you have to produce a ton of footage to edit down to video that is consumable. 15 minute video,
2226080	2230560	you need over an hour of footage to work with video editing is a daunting thing. Yeah, no,
2230560	2234320	that's the, that's the problem. I have too much footage. Like, and I get that you have to edit it
2234320	2239280	down. It's easier if there is dialogue because like, for example, when like an average, like,
2239280	2243520	you know, once again, I'm comparing myself to hermitcraft, um, their videos they have, they,
2244160	2248400	they consider a lot is when they have like two hours worth of dialogue and footage.
2249200	2253600	I'm cutting down like 10 to 20 hours worth of footage.
2253600	2256080	Oh no. Too much footage.
2256080	2257920	That's, that's what you've got to work on for sure.
2257920	2260720	You don't even want to see what it takes to go into my Twitch videos.
2261680	2266480	I save a clip. I add an intro and outro and put my own music on it and done.
2266480	2271520	Yeah, yeah, no, no, I get that. And there's, and there's some folks that that's what they do is
2271520	2277360	they just broadcast on Twitch and then dump their stuff into YouTube and that works for them. That's
2277360	2279760	fine. Uh, I can't do that. I do some editing.
2281760	2286160	I, I don't, I hardly ever do editing. It's, it's also a difference between us,
2286160	2290960	even in Bobby Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, his shows go up later in the week because he
2290960	2296400	likes to edit, to take out some of his pauses and um's and ah's and things that happen that are
2296400	2301520	live. And I usually have this show up later in the night on Sunday. Why? Because I'm like,
2301520	2307440	it's, it warts and all, here it is. Like I, it's just, it is, it's a, it feels like a live
2307440	2313280	presentation, but it's recorded for the podcast. And, uh, it's just, it's just differences in what
2313280	2318720	we're doing, but it takes, it takes a lot to edit where, where editing for me is more cropping,
2318720	2322640	you know, it's like, okay, take out the stuff before the intro, take everything out after the
2322640	2329360	outro, uh, in, in extreme circumstances, bleep something where I accidentally like
2329360	2332960	dock somebody by saying their last name. Like I know that happened once on the show
2333680	2338880	weeks ago. I was, I was talking about a grandpa and I said his real name because a lot of us call
2338880	2343840	him by his last name. So I bleeped it. I took it out. You know, that's very, very rare that I will
2343840	2348240	do that, but for those types of circumstances, yes, I will edit. But, um, yeah, it takes,
2348240	2354160	it takes a big, uh, thing to get me to edit the show. I would reckon though that using my Twitch
2354240	2359520	clips means I've already edited. Yeah. That is the nice thing about Twitch too,
2359520	2364720	is that you can kind of like stamp where the good stuff was and then go back and like do the clips.
2364720	2368400	The highlight feature has actually been really helpful because then that saves me from having
2368400	2374960	to download the entire VOD. Yeah. And then I can save just what I want to, but then again,
2374960	2379360	you know, you could, um, what are you capturing through? Are you using OBS?
2380320	2386480	Yeah, I'm using Streamlabs OBS. So it Yuck. Slobs is terrible.
2387200	2392240	I have no problem with it. It works just fine for what I'm doing. Um, so it's, it's really,
2392240	2398640	a lot of it is time lapses take a lot. Cause I have to replay mod. I have to go back and I have
2398640	2404240	to, uh, basically pick the camera path and, and do all the adjustments through there. So it's,
2404240	2410240	it's cutting that out. And because it took so long to build what I built, I have,
2411280	2416960	it's about a week's worth of time-lapse to go through. So I've gone through two of the two,
2416960	2422720	like two or three hours worth of clips right now to time-lapse and, and I have to time-lapse the
2422720	2428000	whole thing and do the camera sweeps and stuff like that. Um, even though I'm going to cut that
2428000	2433200	down significantly, that's, you know, the, what ends up being probably an hour. Cause it's,
2433200	2438720	it's an eight time speed. So an hour worth of clips is going to be down to like three minutes,
2438720	2443360	but I still have to process the whole thing to get it down to that three minutes. And it's just
2443360	2449840	taking a long time. So plus now that I'm going to be doing some other things involved, creating some
2449840	2454960	data packs and actual mods for Minecraft as well, in order to tell the story that I'm going to be
2454960	2461760	telling. So there's other work that's going into it now too. All right. Um, by the way,
2461760	2466080	this whole talk about streaming and recording at the same time, that's actually powering OLR
2466080	2470880	right now. So of course we're streaming to Twitch, but then there is a local recording of the movie
2470880	2476080	made, um, on the Mac mini. Um, I don't know if everybody knows, but the video and the Twitch
2476080	2481760	stuff is all powered by Mac mini. So we, uh, uh, uh, end up saving the local recording there. We
2481760	2486080	pass it through garage band and that will cause garage band will actually read movies and strip
2486080	2490560	out that audio and make the MP3. And that's basically. You and I need to sit down so I can
2490560	2495120	give you the crash course in logic. Well, I mean, but for, again, I'm cropping, not editing for
2495120	2499760	what I'm doing. I don't need the Primo materials. You know, I could, I could use audacity if that
2499760	2503920	was the thing, you know, so it's, it's good enough, but yeah, if we ever did want to get fancier,
2503920	2511440	sure. But, um, I don't know if I have time to get fancier. All right. There's some other things that
2512400	2517120	we'll talk offline. Fair enough. All right. My gaming week, other stuff. Um, so let's see for
2517120	2521920	my gaming week. So I talked a little bit about Pokemon go. So Pokemon go Fest was this weekend
2521920	2526000	and it was to celebrate the five-year anniversary of the game. And they did a whole thing where the
2526000	2532720	virtual it's all virtual. So all that talk about, you know, the Chicago, uh, festival and how
2532720	2537760	everything clogged the network there that, that, that has been gone for two years now because of
2537760	2542720	the pandemic. So last year, and now this year were Pokemon go Fest everywhere. They cut the
2542720	2547600	price way down this year. It was $5 in honor of the fifth anniversary. I also kind of think
2548320	2552640	they heard some of the feedback last year that it wasn't really justified what they were charging
2552640	2558240	last year. And I think $5 was a little more appropriate for this year. Um, and, uh, yeah,
2558240	2563920	there were lots of different types of spawns. You got a couple things like sock and chatot that
2563920	2567600	don't usually spawn in this part of the world that you were able to catch. They released some
2567600	2572960	new shinies. Um, today was all about raids. And if you're newer to the game, it was a really
2572960	2576560	good chance to catch up on a lot of legendaries you may have missed because they had put out
2576560	2581360	literally every legendary was available today. If you were able to find it, um, just not the
2581360	2585520	mythical stuff, there is a difference there. Um, but there was a lot like, apparently I never got
2585520	2591040	a Zekrom, uh, for whatever reason, I just missed that. So I got one today thanks to, uh, the day
2591040	2596720	two. So it was, it was fine. It was a fun event. I honestly, it was just more about the people.
2596720	2603120	So we went out to San Francisco, as I mentioned, and we, uh, to avoid crazy traffic, we took Bart
2603120	2608880	in to Embarcadero and we played around that part of market, which was really dead. But when we
2608880	2614080	went out to Embarcadero street and walked down from there to Pier 39, yes, that is a long walk.
2614080	2620400	I did 12 miles worth of walking yesterday, 23,000 steps. Uh, because that's just how much
2621040	2624960	there was going on with the games. That's why I'm so tired today and a little sunburned,
2624960	2629520	even though I used sunscreen, it wasn't enough. Um, but anyway, that stuff helped though, right?
2629520	2634000	What's that? The stuff I used helped, right? Oh yeah. The, yeah, that we were talking about
2634000	2638160	at breakfast. Yeah, it did. In fact, I could use a little more, but it's all right. I have
2638160	2643600	multiple containers and it's all over the counter. No worries. No worries. Um, but anyway, uh, so
2643600	2649760	there was tons, my point is there were tons of people like walking from Embarcadero to, uh,
2650320	2655600	the pier and you know, a ton of them were playing Pokemon Go. I would say half the people on the
2655600	2659680	street were playing Pokemon Go and the other half were going, why are all these people looking at
2659680	2665760	their phones? And I heard people ask that out loud and all of that. And, uh, it was also very
2665760	2669760	easy to spot people because they were giving away those little Pikachu hats. I didn't get one,
2669760	2674720	but there were a lot of, um, uh, if you were curious, what were they doing in the cities at
2674720	2680480	those locations? Cause certain cities had like special locations. Um, they had, uh, I don't know
2680480	2685040	if they were Niantic employees. I doubt it. They were probably contractors that were either setting
2685040	2689600	up a little photo op type things, or they were just giving away little Pikachu hats to people,
2689600	2693760	which is fun for the kids and stuff like that. And that's pretty much all they were doing,
2693760	2699200	but there were just so many people in San Francisco playing the game. It was quite a
2699200	2707520	thing to behold also to put it into perspective. There's a badge now in Pokemon Go for, if you use
2707520	2715600	a lure, how many, um, Pokemon get caught with your lure. That's one of the badges that you get.
2716160	2722320	So I think my badge for that, thanks to community days and stuff like that was at about 500
2722320	2730800	yesterday. Or when I started yesterday, after I put one lure down off the beaten path, it was
2730800	2734960	near one of the photo opportunities, but it was still kind of off the beaten path a little bit.
2734960	2746640	So after one lure yesterday, my stat is now 2,146 caught off a lure. So that means 1600 Pokemon were
2746640	2751360	caught off one lure off the beaten path yesterday. So that's, that's how many people were playing
2751360	2757440	Pokemon Go in San Francisco. Uh, so yeah, it's pretty crazy, but I had fun. Uh, it was honestly,
2757440	2764720	it was more just about the people, the experience, the game is whatever it honestly is. I didn't get
2764720	2770320	nearly as many shinies as Shane did. Um, because I, he's, I don't, I don't know what it is with
2770320	2775840	that boy's luck. He got, he walked out of Go Fest with like 43 shinies. And I was like, I got,
2775840	2781680	I remember when I caught the shiny sock and like the second hour of the day, I was like, well,
2781680	2785040	that's it. My day is not going to get any better than this. I got the shiny sock. That's like the
2785040	2790720	best thing you can get today. I guess I'm done. Uh, and I was right. I didn't really know. I got
2790720	2795920	two of the, uh, Ching Cho, Chime Cho. I don't remember the name. It's a little like wind chime
2795920	2802560	thing. Chime Cho. I don't remember what it's called. Uh, but that is the, uh, yeah, that is the,
2802880	2809200	uh, Pokemon that I was able to catch two shinies of yesterday. So, uh, I guess that was cool. Yeah,
2809200	2815920	I didn't get a dino shiny. I'm sorry to say it. So, Oh, Chimecho. Oh, I didn't know. Oh,
2815920	2821280	that makes sense though. I'm, I look, I horribly mispronounced some, I have mispronounced all
2821280	2825840	your names on this show. Of course I'm going to mispronounce Pokemon as well. So it happens.
2825920	2833440	All right. Anyway. Um, so that was Pokemon Go. What else did I do in my gaming week? Uh, I did,
2833440	2837840	uh, Dead by Daylight, of course, cause the anniversary event is still going on.
2837840	2842800	Uh, trying to get some cakes. I finally prestige the character. Give us some more, uh,
2843360	2848880	blood points though. That would be nice. Yeah. Blood points, but, uh, um, iridescent shards.
2848880	2854720	Oh yeah. That too. That would be nice. Um, so, uh, yeah, I played a little bit of that,
2854720	2860080	but not a lot. I played a little more Yakuza, uh, like a dragon. I got up to chapter five on
2860080	2864560	that. So I'm still moving on with that story. Uh, and then randomly, this is super random.
2864560	2868640	I decided to, uh, play blaster master zero again. Cause I was just in the mood. Well,
2868640	2873360	I was reading stuff. I had forgot the third game in that series is coming out.
2873920	2879920	I knew there was a two. I never, I, I, I, maybe we had briefly mentioned three on this show,
2879920	2884480	but I'd forgot. And like, it's coming out very soon. Um, so I was like, I should play through
2884480	2890880	that series again. So I started playing blaster master zero again. Um, cause it's fun. So there's
2890880	2900240	that too. Tay plays games and chat says playing DBD in 2021 cringe, which by the way is another
2900240	2904160	stream y'all should be following. Uh, Tay is saying, um, you're, you're talking about
2904160	2908960	playing DBD in 2021. You play a lot of, although I think now, now, now he's an Overwatch main,
2908960	2917840	I think actually. So in watching some of the recent streams, but, um, well, a few other
2918720	2922720	typically DVD streamers have been switching on to some other things lately too.
2923520	2930240	I, a lot of, um, feedback that the anniversary event is not having the positive effect on the
2930240	2937440	game that people thought it would, that people are playing DC thing to where they start. Yeah,
2937440	2943520	there's that too. Holding people accountable for being assholes. Anyway, shout out to Tay. Um,
2943520	2948640	everything, everything I needed to learn about looping, uh, and teabagging in dead by daylight.
2948640	2956640	I learned no teabagging in my game. All right. Uh, anyway, let's, uh, let's move on. Uh, I think
2956640	2962880	that was it for my game. Let's get into some more news and, uh, I love, I love this one that we're
2962880	2968720	going to get into here. Loki, please start us off. So there is a brand new, uh, we kind of talked,
2968720	2974800	we briefly mentioned it last episode, but there is a brand new fighting game, uh, kind of akin to
2974800	2982080	smash brothers called Nickelodeon. All-star brawl is coming out by the developer, uh,
2982080	2988560	lewd last Luda city. And they said that, um, you know, it's going to be out on pretty much
2988560	2991680	all the different platforms that are out there right now, all the console platforms.
2991680	2996960	Um, but it's just, it's drawing characters from like all of like Nickelodeon shows all
2996960	3001200	these different Nickelodeon shows. So there's like, you know, stuff you would normally expect
3001200	3006480	to be in there and then like other things as well. Not only that. So aside from the characters,
3006480	3012640	we'll get to those in just a sec, but there's also, um, you know, it's actually a decent
3012640	3017600	fighting game based on like some of the features that they're implementing, including roll, roll
3017600	3024160	back net code as well, which is actually a little bit better than, uh, the part that slays me is
3024160	3029520	that the internet code is going to be better than smash brothers. Yeah. So that's, that's kind of
3029520	3035760	funny. Um, so, so the characters announced so far, um, and this is pretty awesome. So
3035760	3041840	you have from Ninja turtles and this is the 1980s Ninja turtles, Leonardo and Michelangelo.
3041840	3046320	That's the one most people, why is there no Raphael? Well, they've only announced some of
3046320	3049680	the characters yet. They haven't announced everybody yet. So this is just what was featured
3049680	3053840	in that first trailer. I assume that all of them will be in there. I mean, come on,
3053840	3058240	Tiger, Tiger, you're just going to have to humor me here. The eighties Ninja turtles are the ones
3058240	3061840	people remember and want to see in these things. Okay. Cause that was the arcade game too,
3061840	3066720	is the eighties version of the Ninja turtles. Yeah. So you have a Nigel Thornberry from the
3066720	3074960	wild Thornberry, um, Ren and Stimpy from Ren Stimpy also powdered toast man, uh, from SpongeBob
3074960	3079520	square pants, which I expected SpongeBob characters in there. SpongeBob, Patrick star
3079520	3086720	and Sandy cheeks. Uh, we have a Blina from our real monsters, uh, the loud house,
3086720	3092480	Lincoln loud and Lucy loud. Also a cartoon. I haven't watched, uh, Helga from Hey Arnold.
3093040	3099760	We have Reptar from Rugrats from invaders in which sold me the game right there. Um,
3100000	3108320	um, Danny from Danny Phantom cat, dog, um, Ang and Cora from, you know, avatar. So,
3109360	3115840	um, that's just pretty awesome. Okay. And then in case, in case you're wondering, um,
3117200	3122400	for those who are hesitant, uh, John K Chris Savino and Butch Hartman will not be paid for
3122400	3128720	royalties for this game. Cause you know, I guess they're questionable. Um, I mean,
3128720	3131840	there's other characters you can probably assume are going to be in there. Obviously
3131840	3137440	Reptar is probably not going to be the only Rugrats character. Um, but we need Angelica
3137440	3141920	with princess powers. Okay. So hold on before y'all shout out the characters we need. It was
3141920	3146960	suggested. We do a list list on this topic. Now I don't, I don't have everything set up for a list
3146960	3152400	list, but I think we could do an informal list list here. I need to read some of the suggestions
3152400	3156720	from chat though, because you all are fucking slaying me right now. I'm dying. So, okay. Some
3156720	3162400	of the chat, uh, comments here from chat, we have, um, uh, Tay plays games, uh, says,
3162400	3170320	do I get to play Lori Beth Denberg from all that I love her. Fun fact, Alan and I actually looked
3170320	3174400	into cause she actually will do weddings. Now we looked into it. That's all I'm going to say. We
3174400	3178720	didn't do it, but we looked into it cause I, I would have loved that. Uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt
3178720	3187440	says, so is Linda Ellerby from Nick news, master and, or the final boss. I love that. Uh, some
3187440	3191680	folks say Mr. Wizard. Okay. You guys are, you guys are going to say, so here we go. I would like to
3191680	3200400	know informally three suggestions you have for the Nickelodeon fighting game. Um, Loki, clearly
3200400	3204000	you've been stewing on this. I need to give Jamie a little, maybe she's been doing that too. I'll
3204000	3207760	give her a little time to brainstorm, but, uh, Loki we'll go to you. What, what would be like
3207760	3214800	your top three suggestions for the game? Um, so, and I had to dig deep, um, for some of these.
3215440	3221200	So, um, starting with number three, David, the gnome, you gotta be in there. Um,
3222320	3231520	I think we have to have, uh, was it barf from, um, you can't do that on television. And then gosh,
3231600	3238000	um, I mean, Mr. Wizard would be pretty good too. I think that'd be funny just cause he's so mean
3238000	3244560	to the children sometimes. Uh, or he's, he's harsh with them. Um, gosh, I don't know. Um,
3244560	3250560	there's so much you could do. Like they could really tap into so many things. Like, um, you
3250560	3255120	know, if they want to get like into like the live action stuff, you know, already the strongest man
3255120	3260400	in the universe, you know, something like that, like just all sorts of crazy. All right. I'll do
3260400	3265920	my top three. Um, so my number three would be the sec. I'm going to show my age here. I don't give
3265920	3272400	a fuck. My number three would be the security guard from today's special. Um, I love today's
3272400	3278480	special. Me too. That was my jam back in the day. So I don't remember the dude's name, but, uh, he
3278480	3282960	was, he was, Oh no, it was the other one was the mannequin that would only, it was like straight
3282960	3287200	out of that lady. The lady would only come to life when looked at or whatever, but I think the
3287200	3292640	security guard was the one I remember. So, um, uh, let's see dark to see it says, Sam, I think
3292640	3297760	I will go from that. Okay. So, uh, that would be my number three. My number two would be the giant
3297760	3302960	nose from double dare. Um, that was always part of the obstacle course and they would have to like,
3302960	3307200	you know, dig through the nostril to find the flag. And it was really gross. So that's my
3307200	3311840	number two is the giant nose from double dare. And then my number one would be, and somebody had
3311840	3315520	already said this in discord. I don't care. I'm stealing this joke. My number one would be Alanis
3315520	3321360	Morissette because I stand and be, she, she was, as everybody knows, part of the cast of you can't
3321360	3326960	do that on television for a short time back in the day. So, uh, Alanis Morissette would be fair game
3326960	3335520	to be in the Nickelodeon fighting game. Uh, so dark, uh, dark, dark Sakura, so many people with
3335520	3342000	dark in their names, dark Sakura, what is your top three? So my name, uh, starting with number three,
3342400	3352000	I would reckon Moira Quirk from guts. She was a referee. The Astro Craig has to be the stage.
3352000	3358960	Absolutely. She's she's still, you know, uh, done a lot of voice acting. So she's been in stuff like
3358960	3364320	recently and she's even worked in Skyrim and everything. So would get really great voice
3364320	3376560	acting from her. All right. Love it. What else? All right. So, um, Hmm. Eureka from Eureka's castle.
3376560	3387600	Yes. Yes. Okay. Um, and then the, uh, the era of drama actually, no, I take that back. One of the
3387600	3394080	tomorrow people. Oh, shit. Okay. Well, I forgot that was on Nickelodeon for a short time. Who
3394080	3400880	was the redheaded guy from, from the nineties tomorrow people. Oh, that's a good one. All
3400880	3405760	right. Um, you guys in chat are killing me. Okay. You ready for some more chat suggestions? Here
3405760	3411760	we go. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says the pinwheel. That's it. Just the pinwheel. I was actually
3411760	3416640	looking at the stuff on pin on pinwheel house. Cause I almost thought about the, uh, the hat
3416640	3422880	people. Um, and I mean, we've got also fairly, there's like so many good things, fairly odd
3422880	3428640	parents, you know, Timmy Turner or something like that. Um, nobody came so close to saying
3428640	3433600	Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but Phineas and Ferb is on Disney. I'm actually super disappointed. Nobody
3433600	3439360	brought up any of the characters from, Hey dude, like the dude ranch should be a stage going to say
3439360	3445360	the boxers from salute your shorts. Okay. Um, other comments in chat, you guys are going off.
3445360	3451120	I love it. Um, why no record in chat says need someone from wild and crazy kids. Yes. There were,
3451120	3456080	they had the same host for years. Uh, and then, oh, our voiceover guy, Jason is in chat. The
3456080	3462560	xj6 V says game over the bully from Nick arcade. That's a good one. Tiger class suggests danger
3462560	3470000	mouse. Yes. Yeah. Or a banana man. What was his little pinfold? Was his friend? No, remember
3470000	3478960	Penfold. Penfold. Shush. Uh, let's see. I'm dying. Oh my God. Those are all the, the Thames
3478960	3486000	production ones. And when Nickelodeon used to go off the air, if you remember those days, I do,
3486000	3491680	I do. I was really young, but I do. They would always show after danger mouse or count
3491680	3497440	Dracula, depending on the day, they would show, um, banana man. I also remember for a short time,
3497440	3502640	it would be the A and E channel at night. It was Nick in the day. That was before Nick at night,
3502640	3507520	if you can believe it. Yeah. We don't think at night's going to have to be its own fighting
3507520	3515920	game. Like we can't. Hey, Rob, what did you know that, um, in the third season of the nineties,
3515920	3521120	tomorrow people, Christopher Lee was the villain in it. No, I'm going to have to go back and find
3521120	3526400	all of these. Cause I missed a bunch of the ones before they canceled it. Honorable mention to
3526400	3531360	powdered toast man from Ren and Stimpy by the way, now that it's on my mind anyway. Oh, uh,
3531360	3540400	character log. Okay. So, um, near Muse says I beat you by seconds with a dude while they are,
3540400	3545440	uh, subscribing again to the channel. Thank you for that. Uh, you guys it's, it's very obvious.
3546000	3550080	A lot of people, especially in their thirties and forties, go in some in their twenties,
3550080	3556160	go figure. A lot of people have a lot of passion around the Nickelodeon franchise. There is a lot
3556160	3562080	of potential here for an amazing game. So I really can't stress this enough or stress this
3562080	3568960	enough. Excuse me. So do not fuck this game up. No, no, no, no. To go into that, let's talk a
3568960	3574160	little bit about how this actually came about. So, uh, developer actually put out a game called
3574160	3579840	slap city, which is kind of a similar type of genre and game. So after they were put,
3579840	3585840	they put that game out, they were approached by Nintendo to make this game. So, um, you know,
3586080	3590640	they do have, you know, Lisa track record of putting out, you know, some decent fighting games.
3591200	3597520	Um, but yeah, right now they said, you know, they, they don't want to talk about the full roster,
3597520	3604080	but like, I I'm, I'm hoping that it's going to be like, I'll pay for DLC for all, all this obscure
3604080	3608800	shit. I mean, like, seriously, like if, if, Hey dude, and you know, all that stuff's gotta be
3608800	3615120	deals. Get a single, you can't do that on television reference in there. I will lose my shit.
3615120	3620800	Like I, or even as a stage, I'll take a stage. Like the locker jokes as a stage would be great.
3620800	3627040	Oh my God. That'd be amazing. And the lockers open up and they're telling jokes to each other.
3628240	3634320	Oh, that would be great. Oh, I love it. I hope, I hope their boardroom conversations on making
3634320	3640160	this game are as lively. Um, uh, I'm sorry. Take place games and chat says slap city has
3640160	3646400	insanely good reviews on steam for what it's worth. So let's not hype this up too much,
3646400	3658800	but on the other hand, too late. All right. What was that? You want to know what sucks is I've
3658800	3664640	been going to see if I can find blue rays of the tomorrow people. No, I think that's great. That
3664640	3668560	was an awesome show. Didn't they try to do a reboot of that a few years ago? They did actually,
3668560	3673920	and they got really great reviews, but they didn't renew it. It was on CW thing. Yeah. I remember
3673920	3678720	that anyway. All right, let's move on and talk about other awesome ideas out there. Maybe,
3678720	3683520	I don't know. We don't know a lot about this idea, but we do know final fantasy 10, three,
3684400	3690320	maybe there was a 10 and a 10, two, of course. And, uh, many people are aware of these games
3690320	3694560	from the remasters that they made, uh, on PlayStation three and PlayStation four.
3694800	3699920	And I think these did pretty well. I know a lot of people revisited the games. Uh, they ended up
3699920	3705840	coming out on Xbox game pass. So I'm sure 10 and 10, two, the remasters did pretty well for square
3705840	3711760	and it probably, it could have them discussing like what might a 10, three look like someday.
3711760	3718240	And as it turns out, uh, Tetsuya Nomura, who, uh, was character designer mentions,
3718240	3725440	if we are to make 10, three, we somehow have a synopsis written by no Jima-san it's sleeping
3725440	3733600	right now, but the plot itself does exist. Um, not Kazushige Nojima ads. I had the opportunity
3733600	3737680	to work with people who entered the game industry after playing final fantasy seven,
3737680	3742160	but now the phase has moved and I'm, I'm going with people who entered after playing final
3742160	3749840	fantasy 10. Um, Toriyama commented the probability is not zero, but we are not in a phase
3749840	3754400	where we can talk about it unless we have finished producing the final fantasy seven remake,
3754400	3758720	which I, I respect that don't bite off more than you can chew. And there's already a lot
3758720	3762400	to still be done with the final fantasy seven remake. We don't even know how many more parts
3762400	3766080	there are. Are they going to try to wrap it up in a second game or are they going to spread?
3766080	3771760	Because I I'm going to argue they, everybody expects it's going to follow the template of
3771760	3777920	final fantasy seven. I don't think it might. I think it could wrap it up in a second game if
3777920	3784000	they wanted to. I think it better not separate my, my OTP again, but, uh, we'll, we'll see anyway.
3784000	3787840	But, uh, so there may be, you know, one or two more games, fall fast. You see if in remake series,
3787840	3791760	but it is interesting. They're leaving that door open to attend three and it's really the
3791760	3798480	equivalent of, so you're saying there's a chance is really where we're left when it comes to final
3798480	3802400	fantasy 10 three, but it is, it's, they did write the story for it. And also, you know,
3802400	3806720	there's probably stories and treatments that have been written for a lot of games
3806720	3811440	that never came to fruition. So it's, it's interesting to think what might that look like?
3811440	3817520	Uh, and even if they, even if they didn't make it a game, they can fancy 10 three oops, all blitz
3817520	3824160	ball. Oh God, no, I hated all the blitz ball stuff. There were rumors that blitz ball was
3824160	3828000	supposed to be added to the final fantasy 14 expansion, but for better or worse,
3828080	3834560	that didn't seem to come to fruition. So, um, dark Tetsuya in chat says, I still want a six
3834560	3839360	two. Yeah. There's lots of final fantasy games that people would like to see, especially,
3839920	3846560	you know, for a long time, the idea of sequels to final fantasy games didn't really exist.
3847200	3851280	It wasn't until 10 two when it was like, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3851280	3856640	They're doing 10 two. Why aren't they calling it 11? Oh, it's a direct sequel to 10. Oh,
3856640	3863920	11 is the online game. So it's, it's interesting. And then after that was when we got the final
3863920	3870000	fantasy four sequel folks forget about that. And I understand, cause it's really not a great game,
3870000	3876640	but the after years was a sequel to final fantasy four. So it'd be, it'd be interesting.
3876640	3882800	I'd love to see a 12 two, but what I really want to see is just a remaster of the 13 trilogy for
3882800	3888240	current consoles, because I think it's time to revisit that. And for, um, justice to be served
3888240	3891840	a little bit for Final Fantasy 13 in retrospect, cause I don't think it's as bad as everyone says
3891840	3899120	it was. Um, Tay plays games and chat is wondering who is 10 three made for most of the kids haven't
3899120	3906160	played anything other than 14 or the seven remake. I don't see a 10 three superseding a, a 16 and a
3906160	3912080	seven team. I'm not sure one has to cancel the other because square does have multiple development
3912080	3916640	teams and obviously they are capable of producing multiple final fantasy projects at a time.
3916640	3921120	Uh, and I think that is best demonstrated by the fact that creative division three
3921120	3928960	is currently making final fantasy 14 and final fantasy 16. That is a huge undertaking and that's
3928960	3935360	just one studio at square. Granted one studio that has made square a lot of money. Uh,
3935360	3938960	thanks to Final Fantasy 14. And it's, but, you know, we could get into the whole thing about
3938960	3944240	how final fantasy 14 is only getting bigger right this second, which is, is interesting,
3944240	3947840	but I'm not, I'm not going to go there right this moment, but to answer the question that
3947840	3953920	Tay poses about who is 10 three made for, I think it's because of the remasters.
3953920	3959040	It's not the original PlayStation two release. I think it's because of the remasters
3959040	3964800	that we do have another generation visiting those games. It's kind of like, and this is random,
3964880	3971360	but I don't give a fuck. You know, one of my favorite movie of all time period is clue the
3971360	3977280	movie from the 1980s. That movie fucking bombed at the box office. People did not understand the
3977280	3981760	multiple ending thing. Uh, it did not make a lot of money at the box office. It was way ahead of
3981760	3988400	its time. It was very much ahead of its time, but now people hold that in such a high regard.
3988400	3993600	Even if they were born much later, you see a lot of, you know, people in their twenties and thirties
3993600	4000880	that love clue the movie, where did they find it? They found it in reruns on basic cable in the
4000880	4005680	nineties, because you guys might remember, do you guys remember channel 31, which is one of the
4005680	4009440	stations here locally. I don't care. I'm going to shout it out. Channel 31 used to play clue
4009440	4013920	the movie in the afternoon, all the fucking time. And there's a lot of stations around the country
4013920	4019840	where they did that. So a lot of people discovered clue when it was broadcast during the day on TV.
4019840	4025280	Now, my point with that is I think there is a younger generation that's discovering 10 and
4025280	4031120	10 two because of the remasters. It, and the fact that these remasters are only like 20 bucks now.
4031120	4034960	And so I, and you know, especially with the pandemic and people playing more games,
4034960	4038800	I think probably more people were playing these games now than probably did in the beginning.
4039440	4044480	So I think that's why the conversation about 10 three is happening now in particular.
4044480	4051200	So it's very interesting. Bobby Blackwolf says, is this the right time for me to profess my love
4051200	4058320	for speed racer 2008? Why not? I think a lot of people really shit on the matrix sequels when
4058320	4064400	they came out, but now look what's happening. Another matrix sequel. Like sometimes things
4064400	4071600	just age a certain way and people want to see them back. Jason and chat, literally the definition
4071680	4078480	of a cult classic. Absolutely. It's hard to call 10 and 10 to a cult classic because they,
4079120	4084160	unlike clue the movie, unlike the Rocky or a picture show, unlike some video games that
4084160	4091440	are cult classics, 10 did well when it released. Yeah, but I get it. I, I, I, I'm not saying that
4091440	4098560	label is inappropriate. It's just a little different. Um, but an excellent aside here,
4098560	4102960	Jason says, I discovered earthbound because it was the cheapest game at Walmart.
4104240	4109040	Fifth dream does point out it's tens 20th anniversary. That's a good point too.
4110080	4117680	So, wow. Wow. I would be all about a 10 three, but I understand there's only so many games that
4117680	4123840	square can do without compromising the quality. And I also realize that doing a game now with
4123840	4129920	the 4k textures and the PlayStation fives and all that stuff, it takes a lot more than it did on the
4129920	4135360	Atari 2,600 than the NES. It takes a lot more resources. It's a bigger industry. So I understand
4135360	4141280	they can only do so many games at once, but maybe someday never say never. You remember I imported
4141280	4146240	10 too. I do. I do remember that. I think the first time I ever saw it was you playing it.
4147200	4152080	Yeah. Cause I had to, well, I knew it was going to have an English release, but I had to have
4152080	4158240	Kotokumi doing the music. All right. Let's move on to our next story because again, another thing
4158240	4164960	from this week that I think is huge news. So dark soccer. I can get my camera to not fall over.
4164960	4173920	There we go. So, now I'm going to say this as someone who plays most of my games through a
4173920	4179600	streaming service. I love streaming my video games. That's how I get to play PC stuff on my Mac
4180400	4185360	and they look good. And people seem to be pretty surprised by it. Well,
4185360	4188640	it looks like Netflix is actually trying to get in on that action now too.
4188640	4193520	You are the official Dead by Daylight Stadia streamer on Twitch.
4195520	4200240	I don't know any other bitch that streams that game on Stadia. You are,
4200240	4204720	you have that market fucking cornered, honey. Well, yeah, but they won't let me put Stadia
4204800	4210160	in my keywords or Mac gaming in my keywords because whatever people don't think people
4210160	4216640	play on Macs and hello. Y'all should see my setup. Okay. My setup is pretty.
4219200	4226240	What was that taste? Sakura is single-handedly keeping Stadia going. Huge. Yep. Anyway,
4227200	4233760	so Netflix wants to get on on that action. They are looking to offer video games through
4233760	4239920	their streaming service as reported to Bloomberg. They said that the games will appear as a new
4239920	4245760	genre on the platform. Kind of like how their documentaries and standups and other things go.
4245760	4251520	They're not really putting too much out into specifics on that, but Netflix doesn't plan on
4251520	4258880	charging any extra for access. Oh, wow. And then there's also, I mean, some of the others are
4258880	4266080	looking into it too. Like Disney plus is, is trying to do it, you know, but I, uh, Disney
4266880	4274400	Comcast, NBC universal. Um, they have other outlets though, but Netflix is just Netflix.
4274400	4284080	Right. Right. So they're looking to, to add more to, uh, their user base. Um, maybe right now,
4284080	4292000	as of well, as of April of this year, um, it, uh, uh, reported 208 million subscribers globally,
4292880	4298480	which added another 4 million after the first quarter of 2021. Um, they thought it was going to
4298480	4305360	go, uh, get higher, but it still grew decently. It was just a little bit less than they thought
4305360	4312640	it would, you know? And so they're really looking to diversify. Um, and I mean, and it's not like
4313600	4319760	they haven't had ties with the video game industry. Um, there's a strange, there was,
4319760	4325280	uh, that stranger things video game that came out in 2019 and stranger things was licensed to dead
4325280	4330160	by daylight. We keep bringing up. Yes, but that is true because the demo doggy is cute.
4330800	4340640	He's a cool little woofer. Um, but also, um, they they've had Castlevania. Um, there's other,
4341280	4345280	other video game related stuff that's been around. That is an interesting full cycle thing
4345280	4351040	is that like, Oh, Netflix really became this booming place for video game media. And now they
4351040	4358080	might want to take that back to actually having video games or choose your own adventure content
4358080	4363840	as well. So like, yeah, yeah. Um, what limited gaming exists now? Yeah. Netflix just had the
4363840	4370240	rentals. You could rent some games, but you couldn't play when the streaming service replaced
4370240	4374320	the rental service. You of course, at the time technology didn't exist to stream a game like
4374320	4380560	that, right? Because there were closest I had to a streaming game was like playing tetranet.
4380560	4384400	There were, um, folks like game fly that were trying to sneak into that market about being
4384400	4388640	the Netflix games in that regard, like literally when we're talking about discs and that service
4388640	4394720	still exists. Actually, Bobby talks about using it still to this day. Um, I'm just curious like
4394720	4399040	to what, what intensity of games are we talking about? And that's, I feel like the wildcard here,
4399040	4402320	because yeah, when you think of Netflix games today, you think about, okay,
4402320	4407440	Minecraft story mode is there. It's it's different, but it's there. Uh, the Netflix said the
4407440	4411760	bandersnatch black mirror, which is very, it's choose your own event, but it is a game. It
4411760	4415760	qualifies a game, but it's very limited. Are we talking about those sort of limited experiences?
4416640	4420720	Or is it something that's really meant to be done on your PC? Because when I think about Netflix,
4420720	4427440	I think about logging on on my Xbox logging on to my PlayStation logging on on my television.
4427440	4432960	And what's, I mean, a, are Microsoft and Sony going to allow Netflix to get into this space?
4432960	4435520	Well, they also had Minecraft story mode as well. That was,
4435520	4438800	I know I mentioned them. Yeah. Keep in mind as well. I mean, now we're,
4438800	4445680	I'm going to take a little touch on politics. Okay. We just had that executive order issued
4446640	4452800	for a higher competition in business markets. I doubt very seriously that the other, the,
4452800	4456560	the competition is going to be able to say much about it. Thanks to the new legislation.
4456560	4461360	And, and to be fair, only to get a replacement for a GPI still though, which they haven't
4461360	4465200	filled that position yet. So right now they can't do anything until that happens.
4465200	4471680	And at least in Microsoft space, I remember I was playing ant stream on the Xbox one and ant
4471680	4477680	stream is a cloud service for retro games. So that whole concept of like, I guess streaming games,
4477680	4483840	even if it's not necessarily a Microsoft product, at least in the X Microsoft space,
4483840	4488000	we've seen it happen before for some weird reason that client's been unavailable for a while.
4488000	4492080	I'm not sure what's going on with ant stream because my subscription finally ran out and
4492080	4498000	I don't plan on re-upping until I can get it on Xbox again specifically the Xbox series X.
4498880	4506400	But I, I think it's interesting, at least there, that sort of precedence is there. So Bobby,
4506400	4511680	I think in their discord, the Xbox one client is even unavailable at the moment. It was there
4511680	4515680	before, but I remember them saying there was some issues or something like that. I could be wrong,
4515680	4519440	but I would want them to have it on series X and S and all that stuff.
4521200	4526480	For the record, by the way, I did also just real quick take a peek because there's a fairly recent
4526480	4535200	article about Stadia as well from gamesindustry.biz which is a pretty good site for some general news.
4535840	4542480	But they were talking about how, of course, Epic has sued Google for the way that their
4543040	4550000	revenue models work. And they're supposed to be readjusting their revenue models.
4550000	4552320	So that's coming up a little later in the show, actually.
4552320	4553920	Is it? Oh, I wasn't aware.
4553920	4555680	We'll talk about that later. Yeah.
4555680	4561440	Okay. But at any rate, according to everything here, it does look like they're alive and well.
4562640	4563600	Yeah. So I-
4563600	4565840	Didn't see any point in doing their own development.
4565840	4571840	I'm just curious, again, what types of games are we talking about on Netflix?
4571840	4575600	And I want to see a little more about what that looks like before I really try to
4576160	4579280	put on the crystal ball and all that and really try to predict anything.
4579280	4580080	Okay, sorry. Go ahead.
4580640	4585440	Okay. They hired Mike Verdu to be the vice president of game development.
4586560	4587120	Huh?
4587120	4588720	I was just saying, I did hear that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4589280	4595600	Yeah. But basically, he was the VP of content for Facebook reality labs
4597440	4604560	and a senior VP of mobile for EA. So he's got a good resume behind him.
4604560	4614720	His CV is looking pretty decently. And then the one I would have more of a worry about
4614720	4617760	is Amazon's. I don't think it's going to do very well.
4619440	4622400	You know, that kind of plays into a comment that Tay plays games,
4622400	4626880	says in our chat is that GeForce Now and Stadia are already struggling.
4626880	4629680	Why not capitalize on it? And you're right. Amazon's,
4630320	4633040	I don't remember what it's called, Luma, Luna, something like that.
4633760	4635440	We've barely heard a blip. Luna.
4635440	4638160	We've barely heard a blip about that. So that really only leaves
4638720	4643200	Microsoft's entry, which they really haven't fully gotten into yet.
4643200	4645760	Like I still feel like Microsoft's still kind of like teasing it and
4645760	4647840	dipping their toe in the water with the whole X cloud stuff.
4649200	4655200	And, you know, so so I agree that like if Netflix is going with a cloud based strategy,
4655200	4658880	that could be very interesting. And, you know, again, especially
4659600	4666240	if they are bundling it in with their movie part, it means it's going to open it up to all these
4666240	4671680	people who already have Netflix. And I think Netflix has to kind of look at how do we get
4671680	4675680	pretty much everybody who's going to sign up for Netflix for movies and TV has already done it.
4675680	4680160	How do we keep expanding beyond that? I don't really think that right now that
4680160	4687120	Stadia or GeForce are really struggling because they've got a decent market.
4687120	4691920	I mean, I personally know more people on GeForce than on Stadia, but.
4693120	4699040	I mean, everything's been kept up to date and Stadia, Google has more relationship deals with
4699040	4702560	these companies that they're offering the game to space through.
4702640	4706080	But I mean, like neither is that unbeatable Goliath yet.
4706960	4712640	No, not yet. Not yet. But I think that because they got the head start on it,
4713600	4718480	that I think they're going to stay. They've already got their names behind them.
4718480	4726000	And GeForce probably like if you're going to think of a tech company, you know, Google is
4726000	4729920	going to be up there above Nvidia because you're thinking of Nvidia when you're thinking of parts.
4729920	4737680	And lack of graphics cards, we're looking at the ability. Yeah, but but at any rate.
4742400	4743200	I think.
4746320	4749440	I think Netflix has a good chance. I don't think Amazon does.
4751440	4755920	We'll see. I still need to know more about Netflix, but I think it's I think the fact
4755920	4763040	that they can essentially Trojan horse their service to millions of people that already have
4763040	4768400	Netflix is going to give them something that these other companies, all of them that you've named,
4768400	4771440	don't have. And I think that's going to be fascinating.
4771440	4774160	I should tell you what the deciding factor for Stadia was for me,
4774960	4779040	was that because keep in mind now it was strictly for Dead by Daylight, right?
4779040	4783600	Right. But I have a bunch of other games because I pay for the the pro.
4784160	4787440	And I've got lots of good stuff on there that I can play that I have played.
4787440	4791200	I mean, I've never had any lag or any problem with it. Just, you know,
4791200	4793680	if the server goes down, the server goes down and that's all it is.
4795360	4801280	But what I like is that the thing that really cemented it for me was the fact that
4801280	4806960	Behaviour had that thing to link my Stadia account to my Steam account.
4806960	4813920	So that my achievements and everything will cross over, even if it's by the DLC again,
4813920	4817280	which I already had a bunch of the DLC anyway, and we bought them on Stadia.
4817920	4822800	So that was my deciding factor. The fact that Google has relationships
4822800	4825760	like this with other companies sort of speaks to me.
4825760	4831120	Yeah. All right. Well, a good discussion. And I think this is really just the first
4831120	4834880	of many nights we're going to be talking about this in the coming months as we start to see
4834880	4838720	more of what this looks like. Well, and one last little thing.
4838720	4843120	Yes, of course. I'm hoping that this ends up being healthy competition.
4843840	4847280	Oh, yeah. That it encourages these other
4847840	4855520	companies to make their models more attractive. To maybe offer like tiered subscriptions,
4855520	4862320	for example. I mean, Amethyst Rose, which, you know, my friend and coworker,
4863280	4869840	she uses the G4 service and pays like five bucks a month. I pay nine for Stadia Pro.
4870880	4875120	But, you know, Stadia Pro is also going to give you like a bunch of free games while you're at it.
4876240	4880560	Just saying, yeah. And Tae plays games and chat says,
4880560	4885360	hi, Timmy, we already pay $17.99 a month for Netflix. Now you can stream games.
4885360	4890480	That is absolutely going to be what gives Netflix a competitive edge if they're not shit games.
4891040	4895920	And that's obviously and here we go again, back to that OLR golden rule we've been saying for
4895920	4900160	years and years. The system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4900160	4904400	That is exactly it. So if Netflix goes into gaming and it's just a bunch of shit,
4904400	4909360	Android games that are, you know, ported for streaming service or whatever, not saying that
4909360	4912400	every Android game is bad, but we know there's a lot of garbage out there.
4912400	4917920	I don't think they'd go that way, though. I'm not people. I'm I'm hoping so. I'm hoping you're
4917920	4923360	right. Let's see what they have in store when they start announcing what the games are for sure.
4924000	4930080	DJ Rama S and I'll let this be the last comment says the NES, the Netflix entertainment system.
4930080	4932880	We'll see. We'll see. All right. Moving on, Loki.
4934240	4942000	Yeah. So this is at least a rumor of a brand new IP being worked on by the coalition,
4942000	4947520	the folks behind Gears of War, of course, leaked from a linked in
4949120	4955200	profile, basically saying that someone is a level designer on brand new IP at coalition.
4955200	4960560	So I mean, yeah, Gears of War is not going to go on forever. So it makes sense that they'd
4960560	4964720	be working on something new. What are we going to hear about that new IP? Who knows?
4967440	4968880	I don't know. It's not surprising.
4968880	4975840	I'm curious to see what they're cooking up. It's nice. It's nice when you can kind of get
4975840	4982080	away from that franchise that you've like people don't think you can make anything else with that
4982080	4986240	game. So I think it'll be nice for them to kind of get away from that and make something different.
4987280	4990560	Yeah, I'm sure. I don't know. I'm sure it'll be cool.
4991360	4996080	Yeah. All right. Something I think is going to be pretty cool. I hope so.
4996080	5001760	And is also going to be competition in the MOBA space is Pokemon Unite. And now we know
5001760	5006960	when Pokemon Unite is coming out. That's right. It's a Pokemon MOBA. So it's League of Legends,
5006960	5009600	Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2, but it's Pokemon.
5011600	5012560	Oh boy.
5012560	5016080	Yeah. This is the game that will get Shane to play MOBAs. And I actually know I'm
5016080	5022080	I'll shade aside. I'm actually excited to try this because I've really sucked at other MOBAs
5022080	5027280	like League of Legends. I've been bullied off of that game. Heroes of the Storm. I will only
5027280	5031920	play PvE because I was bullied off of that game. Dota 2. I'm not sure I still completely
5031920	5039440	understand. So I kind of love the idea that there's going to be a Nintendo MOBA because
5040080	5043520	hopefully I won't be bullied off of the Switch, but I might be. I don't know. We'll see.
5043520	5045760	So is it is it Nintendota?
5049840	5050560	I'm leaving now.
5050560	5056400	Why are you like this? All right. Anyway, I've been this way for a long time.
5057520	5062640	Pokemon Unite. We know the date. It's going to be the 21st next week. So by the next show,
5062640	5066320	this will probably be a part of my gaming week. It will come out on the Switch.
5066320	5070720	So this is in advance of the mobile release. They're going to have a mobile version of this
5070720	5077360	as well. And if you get into the Switch version early before August 31st, you will get a mythical
5077360	5082400	Zeraora, which will let you use that Pokemon, which I imagine they're going to be. It's free
5082400	5087440	to play, but they're probably going to sell characters like a lot of games do and items
5087440	5092160	and things like that. It will have cross-play capabilities with mobile. And yeah, we've known
5092160	5097040	about this for about a year now. In general, two teams of five Pokemon are going to try to kick
5097040	5101920	each other's butt. There are different scoring areas on each side. You score points by capturing
5101920	5106400	wild Pokemon on the field. You want to score more points than the other during the time period,
5106400	5111680	you get to level evolve and learn new moves by defeating wild Pokemon. I think that is an
5111680	5116160	interesting concept that none of these other MOBAs that I know of anyway, have is that like,
5116160	5119520	let's say you play a Charmander. I don't even remember if that's one of them in the game,
5119520	5125680	but as you play the game, you evolve into Charmeleon Charizard. And I think that's kind
5125680	5128080	of neat. The concept of like an evolving character. What about Charmander Shepherd?
5128720	5138080	Um, probably a DLC that will cost you $20,000. Um, it'll be like that Dead by Daylight DLC
5138080	5142000	where you're paying more for a fucking Kriskin than you did for the Resident Evil DLC.
5142560	5150160	So I paid for the Kriskin as did I because and the Claire and the other Leon and all of them,
5151040	5154720	because I paid for survivors, Rob. And guess who doesn't play survivor?
5155440	5164240	Okay. Repeat after me, Dark Sakura. I, I am a consumer whore. There you go. You got it.
5170000	5174400	That's how, you know, we've known each other forever. We finish each other's sentences.
5174400	5176000	We finish each other's sandwiches.
5176800	5187520	Uh, Mike Deft is pointing out the Unite beta in Japan was actually fun says Mike Deft. Um,
5187520	5191920	and, uh, half the chat has left the chat after Loki's joke. Thanks for that, Loki. You know
5191920	5199040	how to keep the ratings going. Good, good job. All right. And, uh, the mod bot just triggered
5199040	5205920	on the word whores. So now we've, we have now allowed the word whores so you can free
5206880	5213200	refer to them as sex workers, Rob. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh,
5213200	5216640	I think this next story is kind of interesting. Uh, Dark Sakura.
5218080	5226480	Well, the man, the myth, the legend, Kojima Hideo, the man who gave us Metal Gear,
5226480	5231600	the man who gave us Silent Hill and more recently has given us Death Stranding.
5231600	5237680	He doesn't like them calling the new release of it a director's cut. This is assuming that
5237680	5242560	there were things that were cut from the movie from the movie, from the game that are being
5242560	5249280	put back into the game because he's the director. And he said, so no, he says that this is a little
5249280	5255440	bit more, in fact, I'll just read his quote about it in the game. It is not what was cut,
5255440	5261120	but what was additionally produced that was included, uh, directors plus.
5261760	5271120	So in my opinion, I don't like to call directors cut. Um, and so yeah, he, he,
5271120	5279120	it's just more content for the game. It's like a special edition. So it's yeah. Um, so at any rate,
5279120	5286000	um, calling it a director's cut was more, is more of like a marketing decision. The marketing team
5286000	5293040	did it. They did the same thing for, uh, the, uh, re-release of Ghosts of Tsushima, uh, Tsushima,
5293040	5298400	sorry, I can pronounce words, the director's cut for August 20th. Um, but basically what they have
5298400	5306000	going on, uh, for Death Stranding quote, quote, director's cut, quote, quote, quote, um, is that
5306000	5312560	it has new story missions, more combat exploration, a firing range or racing mode.
5313600	5321600	Um, and 4k HDR options to launch on September 24th or an upgrade if you have the original.
5322400	5333280	Um, but yeah, Kojima doesn't like it and we support the decisions of our Lord and Master Kojima.
5333280	5339280	It is weird to hear somebody so openly defying. Like, I don't like what they did to this before
5339280	5344080	the fucking thing even releases. But at the same time, like I feel like Hideo Kojima can literally
5344080	5348480	do whatever he wants in this industry. There are very few people, I would say Miyamoto's another
5348480	5353280	one. There are very few people in this industry that are allowed to do literally whatever they
5353280	5361200	want. And people will be like, yes, Kojima, yes. You know, people will still, uh, eat it up. Uh,
5361200	5365600	and it's, it's interesting that he makes the movie comparisons when Death Stranding really
5365600	5372000	is cinematic in so many ways and in some ways has been razzed for not being much of a game.
5372000	5378880	I disagree with that, but I understand that Death Stranding is very cinematic in its ways and that
5378880	5384320	the game part is not necessarily what people look forward to and playing that game, if that makes
5384320	5390240	sense. Well, and I think it's just his point that calling it a director's cut is, uh,
5390880	5395760	a misnomer of sorts. Yes. Yes. I know. And more special edition or whatever. Yeah.
5396400	5402080	Right. Like a director's cut would like be like, say the Superman to Donner's cut.
5403280	5409280	That's a director's cut. Right. Or going back and watching the original run of a Blade Runner
5409920	5414000	without the narration over the end. Cause Harrison Ford hated that.
5414000	5418560	Now, what would you call watching legend with the superior tangerine dream soundtrack?
5419200	5424560	So it's not really a director's cut. I don't know. That's more bonus. All right. Anyway,
5424560	5428560	uh, Tay plays games and chat says, I read Kojima statement, but I was a bit confused.
5428560	5432800	Was he trying to say the additions fundamentally interfered with his creative vision or was it just
5432800	5440080	semantics? Um, I think it was just semantics, but you raised an interesting point. Could there,
5440080	5444720	could you read between the lines here and wonder, did Kojima even want to do this?
5445520	5450960	Or was he kinda asked extremely nicely, maybe not so nicely to do it.
5453200	5457840	I sort of think Kojima again can do whatever he wants. So if they came to him and said,
5457840	5462160	we'd like you to do this, he had every right to say no, but maybe he's like,
5462160	5465680	but it could be more money for my next project. So let's just do it.
5466400	5470560	Maybe it wasn't necessarily that he didn't want to do it, but it was more of like, Hey, we need
5470560	5474400	you to do a PS five port. He's like, Oh cool. I'm going to do that. And I'm going to add some
5474400	5477840	more things to the game. And they're like, we're going to put director's cut on. And he's like,
5481360	5489120	well, and don't forget that Kojima is talking with, uh, Microsoft about, uh, a potential deal.
5489920	5494800	Right. There's that little buzz, buzz, buzz going around, right?
5494800	5498640	Well, don't forget Phil Spencer had the little Kojima pro figure.
5499520	5507360	Oh, Microsoft on his desk. Microsoft's just Microsoft is Phil. Spencer is so fucking good.
5508000	5513680	Like I, I couldn't have, we had him for the Sega Saturn. Why, why could I, I'm just,
5513680	5517440	I'm excited. He's in this industry now and I'm excited. He's leading Microsoft. He's just,
5517440	5524320	he's so fucking good. All right. Yeah. Although I, I, what I hope is that we get something
5525280	5528400	that is what silent Hills was supposed to have been.
5530000	5533680	You know, it's just having this discussion in the car with, um, Shane and Dustin on the
5533680	5537840	drive back from SF last night, we were talking a little bit about like the PT demo and how,
5537840	5542400	you know, it just kinda, you know, it's people still talk about the PT demo to say, hello,
5542400	5547280	here we go. You want to know what I have a Mac version of it called punity.
5547280	5552080	Well, and well, and just the fact, okay. But there's lots of versions of PT because that
5552080	5557600	has inspired people to make all of these clones, knockoffs, emulate, like.
5559280	5566000	Well, the assets exported for this. Yeah. Um, well it had the assets, uh,
5566000	5571120	exported for the build that I have. Um, but there's also, I mean,
5571120	5575280	people are still talking about it. We had boundary break, uh, episodes of it just last year.
5575280	5579120	Yeah. Well, and my, my whole thing that, you know, the discussion was,
5579120	5583760	was how many elements of that maybe ended up in death stranding since they were, you know,
5583760	5588480	they both had Norman Reedus and a lot of the other guests, you know, you kind of wonder how many of
5588480	5593920	the ideas maybe really were in death stranding. And we just don't know. It may have been a thing
5593920	5597680	that was in Kojima's original silent Hill vision. Cause we didn't get to see much of it sadly.
5598240	5601840	Now I'm not saying death stranding is like what silent Hill would have been no,
5601840	5604640	but you got to wonder how many concepts may have been a part of it.
5605200	5611040	I think that death stranding is far larger in scope than the narrative of silent Hill.
5611040	5616640	I think that whole concept of the baby providing guidance and all that,
5616640	5620160	I think there's something there that ties to the silent Hill concept.
5620160	5623360	Because remember in the PT demo, when you've got that, like really
5624080	5626400	that thing talking to you in the sink and all that stuff.
5626400	5627840	What the fetus? Yes.
5627840	5630640	Like I think there, I feel like there might be a connection.
5631200	5633440	So I don't know. All right.
5633440	5642080	I don't at all. I think that the PT itself was to, was to be something to build the buzz
5642080	5648480	for silent Hills. I think that what happened in that house probably had nothing to do with
5648480	5654880	what silent Hills was going to be. And, you know, because that seems like a Kojima thing to do.
5656400	5660080	All right. You know, like, I mean, look at, look at metal gear, solid,
5660080	5663360	uh, uh, three. What, what was right in there for?
5666160	5669360	Uh, it's been forever. Yeah. Or was that two? I don't remember.
5669360	5671200	Yeah. It was the one with right in it
5671840	5676240	where he was pretty and I liked him and he ran around naked holding his crotch
5676240	5680640	while the guy yelled, we need scissors 62. Mike deaf says that was two.
5681200	5686640	That was two. Okay. Um, I just, that part will always just stick in my head forever.
5687520	5691600	We need scissors. All right. Let's move on to, uh,
5691600	5695600	our next story here, which, uh, we kind of referenced a little bit ago, but Loki.
5696480	5703920	My bad. Yeah. So, uh, say is going to be giving developers and publishers, um, more of the cut
5703920	5710720	of the sales. So starting October 1st, they're going to receive 85% of the sales revenue. Um,
5711280	5716640	and then the split applies to only the, the first 3 million of sales. And then it will
5716640	5722560	only be in place until the end of 2023, in which case it'll go back to the current revenue split
5722560	5730880	as it is on top of that. They're also going to be splitting the, uh, stadia pro subscription
5730880	5738800	fees as well. Um, assuming that the publisher puts their title into the stadia pro lineup,
5738800	5744000	which is that game library that you get, you know, free with your membership. And then based
5744000	5750640	on the engagement with those, they will get a cut of that as well. So it depends. So it's
5750640	5755920	good to be involved with it. And also the game has to be played by people. You can't just like,
5755920	5762080	you know, put crappy game in there and just get a cut of it. Right. Um, there's some people that
5762080	5766320	are reacting to this news going, Ooh, she's desperate, but, um, I'm not sure it's really
5766320	5770080	that. I think it's just, this is competition kind of playing off a little bit because now
5770080	5774560	Amazon is in this space. Now, you know, the G force and all these other now Netflix,
5774560	5778320	even though this decision was made before, I'm sure the Netflix thing came out, maybe they were
5778320	5785120	reading some tea leaves. Um, but I think this is more about the lawsuit though. Also with like,
5785120	5791280	say Apple in that whole thing going on because of the cuts that they're taking from their storefront.
5792000	5796480	They're trying to like hard to say when you're not in the boardroom, but, um, anything's possible.
5796480	5803280	Sure. Yeah. So, all right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, we gotta keep it moving here. Uh,
5803280	5807840	we're going to talk about this next story, which I think is really funny when a company leaks its own
5807840	5813200	game. Uh, let's talk about Neo. The world ends with you. How many of you guys are looking forward
5813200	5816960	to that game? Cause I know a lot of people have been rediscovering the original world ends with
5816960	5821120	you game with the switch port and everything like that stylish. Yeah. Well now you can play
5821120	5826400	the stylish sequel Neo. The world ends with you except, um, some folks got to, uh, check it out
5826400	5832640	a little bit early. Here's the thing. Um, if you pre-ordered a physical switch copy on the square
5832640	5838640	Enoch store, they acts at the square Enoch store accidentally started sending out digital codes on
5838640	5846080	July 16th. The game's not out until the 27th. So somebody hit the fire button early on those emails.
5846080	5853600	So oopsie, but it's kind of hard to like a feel bad for square Enochs. They did it themselves.
5853600	5857760	We're not talking about like, Oh, it got hacked and leaked that way. Nope. They just sent out.
5857760	5862080	And for whatever reason, the codes worked that you'd think that would be the other thing is that,
5862080	5867440	okay, the codes just don't work till the 27th. But whoops anyway. Well, the other thing too,
5867440	5872560	which is kind of weird with that is like, typically with digital games on like even
5872560	5878320	the switch storefront, like you can, you can preload them, but they won't let you unlock
5878320	5882080	it until the night. So it's like, they just, they whoopsie the few times they're like,
5882880	5889440	it's not going to be it's fine. It's also important to point out they were getting
5889440	5893200	digital copies of the full game and it was, they they're getting physical copies. That's
5893200	5898400	what they pre-ordered. So folks are thinking the digital codes were probably supposed to be for
5898400	5906720	like a soundtrack, some bonus DLC, cosmetics, something like that. And oops, all retail codes.
5908560	5914320	Just send them codes, like reviewer codes instead of like soundtrack codes or something.
5914320	5918880	So people really could, if they wanted to, they could just keep that digital code they've redeemed
5918880	5922960	and sell their physical edition and they'll still have access. Nothing's going to, I mean,
5923760	5929760	I guess technically in the rules that you agree to when you sign up for these online things,
5929760	5934400	and this is part of the controversy of digital stores, Square, if they wanted to,
5934400	5939440	could pull access to those codes. Because I've seen that, I've seen that happen with
5939440	5944800	preview and early release and types of things before is that they pull the codes so they no
5944800	5950800	longer work after a certain day. But I don't know if it would be a good idea for Square to do it.
5950800	5955600	It would depend on probably how many people this affects. Like if it's only several hundred people,
5955600	5958160	they're probably just going to write it off. They're going to have to.
5959760	5964400	So we'll see. But I just, I think that's hilarious that the company themselves
5964400	5969200	accidentally sent out the game, but these mistakes happen. It's a complicated industry, you guys.
5970560	5975760	Tay plays games and chat says, is always hard to feel bad for Square Enix. Well,
5975760	5979440	they are a very big company. That is true. So, all right.
5979440	5984560	I still think more of the Enix, they should be bringing back some of the old Enix titles,
5984560	5989280	like Bust-A-Move. That's right. No Forgiveness for Square Enix until Bust-A-Move part three.
5989920	5992000	Or four, I guess. Dance Summit.
5992000	5995520	Four. Hey, Dance Summit is fun. Don't knock it.
5995520	6001840	No, I know. I know. But all right. Anyway, since Dark Soccer has brought up some older games,
6001840	6005520	I think it's a good time for an old favorite here at OLR.
6009440	6022800	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull
6022800	6027760	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
6028880	6031440	And what did you pick this week, Dark Soccer?
6031440	6045120	I picked Sakura Taisen from 1996 for Sega Saturn. And this game is fairly unique and
6047360	6056720	it was multiple genre combining. And it really was, I mean, something that spawned several sequels
6056720	6066160	and so much, so many manga. And remember my Cardcaptor Sakura that I have on Dreamcast?
6066160	6069360	They came with the plate and the fork and the clock and everything.
6069360	6069840	Oh, yes.
6069840	6076240	And the pillowcase. They did a Sakura Taisen for Dreamcast that came with some of the
6077200	6082320	same stuff. And yeah, the music in Sakura Taisen is absolutely great.
6083200	6091040	So it was the first installment created by Hiroi Oji. It came out on the Sega Saturn and then was
6091040	6097120	later ported to Dreamcast and had a remake for PlayStation 2. And Sega defined it as a dramatic
6097120	6105120	adventure game. And what happened is that it was an overlay of three different genre. You had
6105360	6114400	tactical role-playing, you had a dating sim and a visual novel. So it was set in 1923 during the
6114400	6121360	Taisho era. And it follows this group called the Imperial Combat Review, which is a military unit
6121360	6126480	that fights supernatural threats against Tokyo. And they have a cover as a theater troupe.
6127280	6131680	Um, one of the ensigns of the Imperial Japanese Navy,
6131680	6136960	Ogami Ichiro, was assigned to lead the flower division, which was all women with magical
6136960	6146720	abilities. And they use steam-powered armor. So it's sort of like turn, well, I'd say early,
6147520	6155680	early 20th century, um, steampunk-ish magical Japan. That seems pretty okay.
6156320	6164240	Um, so the concept for it began in 1990. Um, the team that, um, Hiroi had, uh,
6164240	6170880	sort of working on his concept and then got approval, uh, by Sega. And then it brought in,
6170880	6178880	um, some pretty good, uh, writers, character designers and composers, like the composer was,
6178880	6187520	um, Tanaka Kohei. Um, and among some of this stuff that, that he did, um, he did some stuff
6187520	6195600	it will in, uh, uh, anime, he did the arrangement opening and ending for Dragon Ball. He did, uh,
6195600	6200160	some stuff. He did, uh, some stuff for Patlabor, you know, where I'm talking like, like the awesome
6200160	6206160	eighties anime, he did stuff for bastard. He did stuff for a spirit of wonder dragon half,
6206880	6213040	you know, so, uh, Tenshi Mujo GXP, he also did, I'm trying to think of some more recent stuff.
6213680	6221760	Um, he did the Sakura Taisen animation that just came out in 2020. Um, Hayate the combat
6221760	6226240	butler, if anyone else has watched that, he did a bunch of, uh, full length movies. So I'm just
6226240	6234160	saying he's got a lot of good, he did the music for Gravity Rush and Alundra. So anyway, I just
6234160	6243840	wanted to, to point out the music was very good. Um, so going back into this, um, like I said,
6243840	6251040	it's cross genre. So you have the two gameplay modes. One is an adventure mode and the other is
6251040	6256400	your battle mode. The adventure mode is between, uh, these different periods where you navigate
6256400	6260640	the grand Imperial theater and interact with the characters. And then the battle mode is a
6260640	6266640	turn-based battle system on a tile grid kind of, you know, it's tactics, it's a tactics style game.
6266640	6271760	And so your progress is saved at the end of each episode. So the episodes go like you're watching,
6271760	6278240	um, uh, an anime. They, they have, uh, each different episode as you're going through the story.
6279040	6287360	Um, so, uh, you have an adventure mode, you can walk through the theater. I kind of thought it
6287360	6293120	was a little bit like Danganronpa a little bit for the walking around. Um, and then you have
6293120	6297680	these critical conversations that you can have with the flower division and the supporting
6297680	6302400	characters. Um, and they give you a time limit for you to put in your input. So depending on
6302400	6307920	how you respond, the character may respond positively or negatively, and it affects your
6307920	6316320	future interactions. Um, and then there's also, uh, you can hold like your cursor over the character's
6316320	6322080	portrait to hear their inner monologue, which is fairly interesting. Um, and then of course,
6322080	6326560	each of the main, uh, heroines have their own different quirk that you have to remember so
6326560	6334560	that you can raise their trust level with you. So dating sim. Um, and so, uh, for the, the battle
6334560	6343360	mode, you have, uh, each unit has their turn and each has two actions. Um, you can do two actions
6343360	6348800	during, during your turn. So you have attack, defend, move, and death blow, which is a one hit
6348800	6354800	kill. Um, you also have some charging. You also have healing, um, which those are done to like
6354800	6361840	the unit. Um, and if you, if you lose, you can rematch. Um, and it's got animated cut scenes and
6361840	6372560	musical numbers and all kinds of fun stuff. Um, so the game in and of itself was partly proposed
6373520	6380320	um, by way of tabletop role-playing games. Um, the, he called, uh, Hiroi and the team called
6380320	6387440	them Sakura 1 and Sakura 2, which were the strategy elements came into the game from this
6387440	6392240	and as well as the story came in and they were also, you know, took a lot of influence from the
6392240	6400400	Fire Emblem series, you know, with the turn-based, uh, combat using that grid. Um, and then once
6400400	6405280	it was, you know, they had a full idea together, they, you know, the project will make a great
6405280	6412640	game. He proposed Sakura to, uh, different companies and none of them was interested in it.
6412640	6420240	And so he, he put the game aside and then, um, the vice-president of Sega at the time, um,
6421200	6429440	Iri, I'm going to mispronounce this, Iri Maigeri Suichiro, um, had contacted him about the, uh,
6429440	6436240	possibility of doing a game with a mascot for, you know, to develop a mascot for the Sega Saturn.
6436240	6446320	Um, and Hiroi had some different suggestions, um, but it was eventually, this is what led to
6446720	6459360	Sakura Taisen coming out on Saturn. Um, so at any rate, it has a lot of things in common. Um,
6459360	6468560	it basically is a bishoujo game, meaning pretty girl, you know, um, as, as opposed to bishounen
6468560	6473120	for pretty boy, but you have, you know, anyway, going, going back. So there were lots of things
6473120	6478880	in the battle scenes were, um, that were, uh, influenced by, uh, TV of an earlier era,
6478880	6486000	like the common writer series and Ultraman, um, by having like the larger mecha fight.
6486800	6495680	Um, and so the art design of going into the art design on this one, um, the, uh, the art
6496480	6502080	had some, there were some placeholders on there, but it was finally, uh, designed, fully designed
6502080	6510320	and finalized by Fujishima Kosuke, who did Oh My Goddess or Amigami Sama. Um, you know,
6510320	6515920	I'd say the anime probably had a lot more popularity in the nineties. Um, but, uh,
6515920	6521760	but his work was like the glue that held the project together. And so he came up with all
6521760	6528320	kinds of outfits and everything for them. And then, um, the supporting cast and general animation
6528320	6535440	was done by, uh, Matsubara Hidenori. Um, so they, they really had, you know, they,
6535440	6540160	they also did a little bit of the basis for their general style, like for the uniforms,
6540960	6552720	sort of loosely based off of, um, uh, early British soldier uniforms a little bit. Um,
6552720	6559520	and now Hiroi was going to do this in Meiji era Japan, but it looked like it was going to
6559520	6564080	be better to do it during the Taisho era, which is when Japan was integrating Western culture
6564080	6569840	more so, and hence the designs of the uniforms. So, um, and also though in the original draft,
6569840	6572960	it was supposed to be a lot darker because it brought into account the great Kanto earthquake
6573520	6578560	and then the breaking down of the Taisho period, but they threw that out totally and just kept
6578560	6583920	certain elements that were gonna, uh, you know, just keep it a little bit more light and
6583920	6591680	lighthearted. Um, and so, I mean, basically that, that's it. It had some great voice actors. I mean,
6591680	6600000	first of all, um, Sakura was voiced by, uh, Yokoyama Chisa. Um, she, uh, she's been voice
6600000	6605920	acting those since eight 87, like that, uh, black magic M66. That was like a, what I really liked
6605920	6611920	back then robot carnival. Um, I'm trying to think of something that more people might've
6611920	6623840	heard her in Rojin Z, uh, Miki Momo, um, golf horse. Uh, she was, uh, uh, Murugu and Yu Yu Hakusho,
6623840	6630320	uh, Himechan no ribbon. She did some stuff in there anyway. Um, so yeah, uh, you know,
6630400	6638480	they got some pretty great voice talent in there. Um, they have, uh, had some singers who were also,
6638480	6644480	uh, um, doing some of the voice acting roles because they had to be able to sing as well.
6644480	6651040	Uh, you know, uh, a couple of, um, the, uh, actress, the actor actor who is actually, um,
6651040	6657600	Ogami, the, the main guy had almost no voice acting. Um, he was in training for a voice actor
6657680	6665840	and they, they took him in and he did really well and he was the last, uh, character to be cast.
6666880	6672320	So, yeah. Um, I'm, I'm going to get a little bit past some of the background on this. It had a
6672320	6678400	great soundtrack, the Sakura, uh, Tyson soundtrack, steam gramophone 51 tracks from the game published
6678400	6686480	by BMG Japan. Um, and then, um, there was the vocal collection also done by BMG and then the
6686480	6695200	2003 remake, um, was released by, uh, Avex mode. Hmm. So, um, so yeah, for releases, it was, um,
6695200	6701200	a special Sega presentation in 1995, uh, for release in April, 1996 for the Sega Genesis,
6701200	6707360	not Genesis one missing Genesis, the Sega Saturn. Um, and it was dubbed a dramatic adventure. Um,
6707360	6714080	the port for Dreamcast came out May 25th, uh, 2000 with a version for I mode mobile devices.
6714720	6719760	Um, and of course that was the special edition that had also plates and saucers and all kinds
6719760	6730000	of goodies. It had windows ports, um, for windows, Emmy and windows 2000, um, uh, windows 95 and
6730000	6738240	windows 98 as well. It had a sequel on PSP. Uh, there was also the DVD ROM version out for windows
6738240	6745680	2000 XP and Vista, um, ASCII core did, um, some, uh, guidebooks for them. Um,
6746800	6756320	but it never did get an English release. Um, they, uh, he really wanted it to be released in,
6756320	6764800	in the U S um, but there is a patch, a translation patch out for Saturn. Um, as we can see from the,
6765360	6769200	the playthrough that we have going on, I think we're seeing a Twitch. Yeah. Yeah.
6769200	6774960	Yeah. It's a fan translation. Um, so there was a PS two remake. Um, it was a 3d remake
6774960	6780080	called Sakura Tyson in hot blood, and it was announced as part of the Sakura Tyson world
6780080	6789520	project, which was an effort to bring it to a new audience. Um, and they did lots of reworks. They,
6789520	6798560	uh, changed the, the functions in the, uh, the, the story mode part of it. Um, they brought back,
6798560	6806640	um, all of the original, uh, actresses recorded new voice acting for it. Um, and there you go.
6806640	6812640	It came out in February 22nd, 2003 first prints came out with a special DVD that had a documentary
6812640	6818320	dealing with the development process of Sakura Tyson and mobile tie-in stuff. Many games,
6818320	6825840	other stuff came out, but, um, they, uh, they were going to have access to be content through
6825840	6830400	a direct cable connection, but because of driver capacity issues, they did a password system
6830400	6839280	instead. The game was wonderfully received. It got a, uh, 33 out of 40 from Famitsu,
6840240	6848800	um, a 35 out of 40 for the PS2 version. Um, it did get, um, uh, a couple of English language
6848800	6856400	reviews, including a game fan, um, Dreamcast magazine, uh, had their own, uh, review of it.
6856400	6866320	The sales were amazing. Um, it was, he promised that it would sell 200,000 units and, um, it
6866320	6878480	actually sold 2005, sorry, 205,270 units in the first week. So it is considered to be one of the
6878480	6887120	best-selling, uh, titles of all time. Um, it's like 40, 54th as of 2003 for the, for the remake.
6887920	6893760	Um, the only thing that outsold it in its timeframe was Star Ocean till the end of time by
6893760	6900800	Enix and Dynasty Warriors 4 from Toei. That's with that, uh, that version. Um, so it also had
6900800	6906640	other, uh, releases. There were three sequels, Sakura Taisen 2, Thou Shalt Not Die for Saturn,
6907200	6912480	Sakura, uh, Sakura Taisen 3 is Paris Burning, which makes me laugh for other reasons.
6913520	6918800	Right. Yeah. Sakura Taisen 4, Fall in Love Maidens for the Dreamcast.
6918800	6922880	That's the one that came with this stuff, by the way. Um, there was supposed to be, um,
6922880	6929600	there's a fourth sequel for PS2 called Sakura Wars 5, Farewell My Lovely. Um, it was published
6929600	6939600	as Sakura Wars So Long My Love outside of Japan. Um, it had, uh, anime, manga, uh, you know,
6939600	6950240	character CDs. Um, it had, uh, some of the characters showed up in Project X Zone on 3DS.
6951200	6955920	Um, there's the OAV series, uh, Sakura Taisen, The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms.
6956640	6963760	Um, Studio Madhouse, um, was behind, uh, well, actually, um,
6965200	6969760	it was co-produced by Red Company that did Sakura Taisen, Madhouse, and Studio Matrix.
6970400	6977040	Um, and it basically expanded upon the first game. It had a few more things behind the scenes. And
6977040	6982320	there was, of course, the manga, um, that was serialized in Monthly Magazine, uh, Zedd. Um,
6982320	6989600	and then it has since been released in Tankoban, um, afterwards. And so, uh, published by Kodansha.
6989600	6994800	And that's it. That is everything. Well, not everything you should know, but it's a lot.
6994800	6999920	Sakura Taisen is one of the ones I've been holding off on for a while because so much.
6999920	7004080	But it's also interesting because I would bet a lot of listeners out there, I mean,
7004080	7009680	I'm sure plenty do know about this series, but I bet there's a lot that don't, um, and just how
7010240	7015360	much of this there has been. And, you know, kind of, as you pointed out, it's really kind of unique
7015360	7019840	to the Japanese gaming audience because they really have resisted, you know, putting this out,
7019840	7025520	uh, for, you know, our local, yeah, our localized, uh, audience for some time. And it took fan
7025520	7029600	translations and stuff to make that happen. But, um, obviously this is a huge franchise,
7029600	7034480	just maybe not here in this country and musicals, according to yes.
7035280	7045920	To, uh, there is, uh, Shin Sakura Taisen. Um, and yeah, I, I, uh, I, I wasn't going to go too much
7045920	7051840	into what else the, uh, the voice actress had done, but the voice cast is really, really top.
7051840	7056160	I mean, even this guy for this, having been his first role to play the main character,
7056960	7061120	he did really well. I thought it was great. All right. So there it is your classic game
7061120	7067040	of the week, Sakura Taisen or Sakura Wars. All right. Uh, let's move on actually quickly before
7067040	7070640	we get into rapid fire news. I remembered I left something out of my gaming week and I thought this
7070640	7076240	would be kind of funny. Um, since we were out doing Pokemon go yesterday, uh, we, we had taken
7076240	7080800	the Bart over there and we'd, we'd, uh, written, which is the train basically in the Bay area.
7080800	7087360	So we, um, exactly. Um, and so we had parked at Concord, you know, that area. So we actually
7087360	7093520	ended up going over to the Concord mall to eat and, uh, we went around one. So I, I haven't
7093520	7098960	been around one since, you know, before the pandemic. So, um, I saw a lot of folks playing
7098960	7103360	DDR and that stuff, which I wasn't going to get on there in a mat with a mask and everything.
7103360	7106800	People play DDR to mask and all that stuff now. And I'm like, ah, I just don't, I don't have the
7106800	7111600	stamina for it, you know, and so forth, but there's a 2d X machine in the corner.
7111600	7119840	They had the latest one. It was the, um, the B B's Bistro. I don't know what the cooking one,
7119840	7124080	cause it has a little cooking mini game at the end. So I, I just sat in the corner and played
7124080	7129280	that over. That's it then. Thank you. Beast over. I sat in the corner and played that all night.
7129280	7133040	Now I was definitely grandpa on the machine because I was like, I'm going to play songs
7133040	7139440	from third style. Jamie, I played, I played the Safari. I did be me. Uh, but I did try,
7139440	7145120	but I was, do you agree the best version of Safari is the original version and not the fast one?
7145920	7150000	Yes. The original is much better. Um, but I, you know, the fast one was what was on the machine,
7150000	7154640	but I did unlock through that mini game. I unlocked some song that I tried. It was a
7154640	7159600	nine star song though. So I flopped. I did as my last stage and I flopped. It was really good song.
7159600	7164560	I played some of the new songs and I was into them, the ones that I picked. Um, so I, yes,
7164560	7168160	I tried to mix up my classics with some contemporary stuff, but yeah, I thought some
7168160	7171840	you might get a kick out of that as a, Oh yeah, I played two DX this week. And it's, it's actually
7172400	7179600	where I was at the arcade and I played nothing but two DX. I didn't, uh, the, um,
7179600	7183520	Shane was playing the one that looks like the, the washing machine where you hit the edge on
7183520	7188800	the outside and it's all bright. I can't remember the name. Oh, um, my, my, is that it? No, I thought
7188800	7194880	I had a different name. Is there another game like that? Waka it's Waka. Oh, Waka. Oh, that's
7194880	7202480	what he was playing. Um, I like my, my, and like groove coaster was playing, uh, that a lot, but,
7202480	7207600	um, Oh, Jason says, you can see your play history on the EMU's portal. I need to log in and set up
7207600	7212880	my card and all that stuff. Um, I really need Roseville to get the round one up and going,
7212880	7218480	I would play more two DX in the arcade. If we're like kind of coming soon for a long time now,
7218480	7224000	like I understand, you know, COVID fucked everything up. Like I get it. So I'm not like,
7224000	7228160	why isn't it out? But I'm still like, Oh, hurry up and open. Cause I want to play so bad.
7230320	7236560	So one of these days, um, let's see, what was, uh, I was trying to think of it along with the
7236560	7241280	music games. Oh, you know, what's interesting. A friend of mine here locally bought a theater,
7241280	7246320	the machine and has it in his house now. And I want to go over and play it so bad. Cause I love
7246320	7250560	like theater isms. One of my favorite music cabs. Cause the DS game is no dance rush.
7252240	7256640	Lots of fun. I love theater them. The arcade version's really cool. And he has it in his
7256640	7261760	house. He had the money and, and setting up a little arcade in his spare room. And he really,
7261760	7266000	cause he's a huge final fantasy fan. So he really liked it too. Um, so yeah, I'm hoping to go over
7266000	7269920	there and play that. So that'd be fun. I don't know if he has it hooked up on EMU's or, or
7269920	7273920	it's not EMU's, but you know, a comparable system. I don't know if he has, cause I have a card for
7273920	7280320	that. So anyway, uh, Bobby Blackwell says I have considered getting a used 2DX cabinet for my
7280320	7285120	arcade. They are lots of fun. They are big and make a lot of noise. The only problem is at round
7285120	7289520	one, everything makes noise. And so sometimes it's really hard to hear, but I get, I have a
7289520	7294720	hard time there. Well, if I think ahead, you can plug in headphones into these newer machines,
7294720	7300480	but I just, I don't plan right for this stuff. So my bad. All right. Anyway, let's move on.
7300480	7304320	Let's get into some other rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other things going on
7304320	7312480	in the industry. Uh, Loki. Yeah. So like we, um, we've talked about some of the different Bethesda
7312480	7317200	games and stuff coming out and different exclusives and timed exclusives. Well, one of
7317200	7322000	the other games that was also supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation five ghost wire Tokyo
7322000	7330320	has been delayed to 2022, but, um, not a huge surprise and, you know, obviously
7330320	7336320	COVID did play a big part of that. So we'll just have to wait longer. It's fine.
7338400	7343440	And then, uh, apparently there's going to be an update to, uh, Android with Android 12,
7343440	7349760	that'll actually allow you to play games as they download. So they said some titles that support
7349760	7355040	that they'll be able to play within seconds, which is pretty cool, especially for some larger
7355040	7359680	download games. And if you're downloading in a spotty cell signal area or something as opposed
7359680	7367200	to weekly. So, yeah, they said, for example, you know, like a 20, 127 megabyte game, um,
7368000	7373280	can be played after about 20% of it's downloaded. That's getting very common these days too. Cause,
7373280	7378480	um, you know, some PC and I'm sure Mac stuff, you know, it's kind of like that. And then, um,
7378960	7383440	Microsoft X-Box is doing that stuff too, where it's like, when you download game pass games,
7383440	7386880	you probably only be a third of the way in the download and it's ready to run.
7386880	7395280	So it's kind of nice. We like that. Yeah. All right. Uh, so, um, it seems like almost
7395280	7399760	every week I have something about someone found a really good copy of this old game and it sold
7399760	7406960	for a bunch of money that happened again. Um, now super Mario 64 is the world's most expensive
7406960	7414240	video game. It just sold for 1.56 million, which broke the record set by the legend of
7414240	7421520	Zelda two days before. Um, and, uh, it was again by put up by heritage auctions. Um,
7422400	7433360	and it was purchased after 16, uh, 16 bids. And, uh, this particular, uh, copy is, you know, nice
7434000	7443120	new in the box. Really pretty. Yeah. Um, but also it was, I mean, the game has significance
7443120	7454000	because it was, uh, uh, you know, the first, you know, real 3d Mario game. And it was kind of weird
7454000	7461120	because I think it signaled a transition away from cartridge based gaming because it wasn't
7461120	7468080	too long that CD and DVD and then blue Ray replaced everything. Although we had our moment
7468080	7476080	with the, with the giga desk. Good job, Sega. True thumbs up. Um, so yeah, there you go. Um, it,
7476080	7484800	it sold for a lot, a lot of money. It was, um, in near perfect condition. Um, it had a plastic case
7484800	7492560	and was still factory sealed and shrink wrapped. And it rated a 9.8 or an eight plus plus rating
7492560	7499520	on the water scale. So it was practically undamaged. It was near perfect. Um, and they
7499520	7506320	said they found no notable, uh, imperfections. So good deal. All right. And moving forward, um,
7507600	7513360	now we're getting into more Mario and a little bit more luxury. Now I thought that I was,
7513360	7519120	I had my eyes set really high when I went in my Hermes, uh, Apple watch still kind of want one,
7519120	7527440	at least want the band, but now, uh, uh, Tug Hauer, which is like one of the top luxury
7527440	7536800	watchmakers in the world, um, has a limited edition super Mario watch. Um, and, uh, it's,
7536800	7547680	it's a smartwatch. Um, and its price is $2,150. Um, sheesh. Yeah. Actually I take that back
7547680	7553040	because there's a typo on this. It shouldn't be dollars. That's, uh, 2,150 pounds.
7555440	7564480	So it's even more in the dollars. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, it looks cool. It's got a red band.
7564480	7571680	It comes with a nice case, you know, and you pretty much, I think get like lifetimes of
7571680	7581520	repairs on it because, uh, Tug Hauer is like, yeah. Yeah. When they talk about Swiss precision,
7581520	7590640	this is some fucking Swiss, uh, precision from a Swiss watchmaker thumbs. So anyway, um, yeah,
7590800	7597200	go buy me one. Thank you. I still want my Hermes. Uh, I'm going to seek something in here real
7597200	7601360	quick, uh, before we get to world release dates, um, because it was mentioned in our intro tonight
7601360	7606400	by Jason, but one other announcement that came out on July 15th has to do with path of exile.
7606400	7610160	You know, that game has been around since 2010. That's like an 11 year old game at this point,
7610160	7615520	kind of the free to play answer to Diablo three, uh, path of exile had a new expansion announced
7615520	7621200	called expedition and it's out very soon. It's out, I believe on the 23rd was the day for that.
7621200	7625600	Um, so it's coming out very soon and it's going to be doing some different things to the game.
7625600	7631760	Uh, so you have to excavate relics in the game and, uh, you are doing this to, uh, you know,
7631760	7638160	make peace with new merchants, uh, in the world. Uh, but there are also new support and skill gems
7638160	7642560	that are going to be added to the game. So that means you'll get to see some new skills. Uh,
7642560	7648240	there's a skill called spectral helix and something called explosive concoction also.
7648240	7652560	And this is also very interesting, I think, because this might be a reason to revisit
7652560	7658800	path of exile. If you haven't done it in a while, uh, balance changes as well as a rework of the
7658800	7663760	first act is coming as well. And then I think they're talking about the flask system is also
7663760	7668240	going to be changed. So this is some pretty hefty changes in advance of path of exile too, which is
7668320	7672720	still a thing that's happening. Um, so yeah, I'd be curious to check this out. I think it's the
7672720	7678000	23rd on PC and I think the 28th on consoles. So, um, you can check that out in the coming week,
7678000	7682160	uh, cause remember path of exile is a free to play, uh, type of game. So pretty cool.
7683040	7687120	All right. Uh, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7688720	7693280	Yeah. So in the U S we've got a few things coming out this week, starting with Akiba's
7693280	7698320	trip, hell bound and debriefed coming on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.
7699280	7705040	We have Ender Lily's quietus of the nights and that's on PlayStation four,

7754720	7760080	out in a regular and limited edition this week for the Nintendo switch. And, uh, it's kind of
7760080	7765680	a slower week in Japan. This week is the only other release we have here is a Renai, uh, Kari
7765680	7770720	Chamimashita, uh, is out as well on the switch this week. Uh, trying to see if things are a
7770720	7776800	little more exciting on the PlayStation four or five. Uh, we do have Utawari Umono,
7776800	7783280	Zan two is, uh, out in a regular and a premium edition, uh, this week on the PlayStation five
7783280	7790320	and the PlayStation four also has that same game coming out on that. Um, but that is really it.
7791120	7794480	It's, uh, somewhat of a slower week. I think last week there was a ton in Japan. So it's
7794480	7799760	a little slower this week, but, um, still some stuff. Well, we have some stuff for the UK.
7800720	7809280	Um, on the 20th, we have blasphemous deluxe edition. Um, Chris tales also on the 20th on
7809280	7817440	the 21st, right in four. I love the right end games. Um, the Sims cottage living, uh,
7817440	7824080	Akiba's trip, hell, uh, hell bound and debriefed on the 23rd further on the 23rd. We also have
7824080	7831360	cooking mama cook star. There's still cooking mama, um, lost words. Is that the one that mines
7831360	7838320	your Bitcoin on your, uh, on the switch? Remember that old wacky thing? I think it came out that
7838320	7842560	actually wasn't true, but still is hilarious headlines. Sorry, Jamie. I had to go and then
7842560	7850800	Peter's going to make another version of it. Um, so, uh, urban trial tricky. Um, the keep
7850800	7859040	also comes out. Um, we have necromunda hired gun and blue fire. Blue fire looks kind of cool.
7860000	7867360	All right. We have some more stories and then we'll get to your emails if there are any,
7867360	7873520	or some of your discord posts and drag talk, your chat comments as well. We'll get to all
7873520	7878880	that in just a moment, but first some more stories. Loki. Yes. So everybody's still
7878880	7887360	frustrated with the Nintendo switch joy con controllers drifting. Um, so there has been a new
7887920	7893280	kind of fixed proposed online. If you don't want to send your joy cons into Nintendo,
7893280	7899600	they have them repaired, um, using some cardboard and basically throwing that in there. I think it's
7899600	7908400	on top of the battery and basically applying some more pressure to the actual, um, joystick itself
7908480	7916640	to, uh, prevent it from drifting. So I probably going to try that at some point because I know
7917600	7924240	I've replaced the analog six in most of the joy cons that we have, although it broke one of them
7924240	7933600	doing that. So that was fun. Um, but I still have a future to fix. And so it means worth a shot,
7933600	7940000	I guess it's been working for people. It's interesting that valve was actually asked
7940000	7945840	about that steam deck thing they're doing. Does do the, do the joysticks drift. Somebody actually
7945840	7949600	fucking asked them that. And I thought that was a very hilarious question. They wouldn't,
7949600	7954880	they wouldn't know like until, because it's not something that would appear until like months
7954880	7960800	later. I wouldn't tell anybody anyway. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh, it's our joysticks are garbage,
7960880	7965120	you know? Yeah. Do you, I think it's also, Nintendo was asked that about the OLED model
7965120	7971840	and they declined to comment like they're not done shit. Well, because class action is either
7971840	7975680	happening already or it's going to happen. And so Nintendo is not going to say a goddamn thing
7975680	7982320	about it. That's why they can't do it. They're not obviously not it. Obviously it is. And it's, um,
7983200	7989600	well, and also for them to comment on it with the OLED would be for them to acknowledge it exists
7989600	7993600	on the regular one. Although I don't disagree with you. It's probably going to be a problem
7993600	8000640	on the OLED, but that's the real issue for them to say yes, the OLED is fine is in, in also kind
8000640	8004400	of conversely saying it's not fine. And that's just going to add fire to the class action.
8004400	8010400	That's why they won't answer it. Well, yeah. And the worst part about it too, is like even on,
8010400	8019840	um, was it the, um, was it the switch light is they, those dripped as well. And that you can't
8019840	8025360	replace those only can't, you know, replace them easily. You have to take it apart or,
8025360	8031360	you know, send it to Nintendo. So yeah. Oh boy. All right. Until then car,
8031360	8034800	I love that the chat is lighting up about cardboard. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says,
8034800	8038560	Nintendo Labo to the rescue. There you go. Since Nintendo just said, you know,
8038640	8043360	fuck Labo at this point, you can, uh, repurpose it there to fix your joy cons. Perfect. Uh,
8043360	8048560	orange. Right. And chat says cardboard. It can fix joy cons and 2d X controllers.
8048560	8054560	Do you remember your machines? Do you remember when folks would have to shave down the keys on
8054560	8058720	their 2d X controllers to get them to work better? I remember that was the thing. Hey,
8058720	8065200	that was the best part. I still have cardboard. Yeah. In my 2d X controllers in that closet,
8065200	8070560	the best part of the U S beat mania release was those controllers. Everybody wanted those
8070560	8074640	controllers because they were so much better, even though they didn't really change that much,
8074640	8081360	but they fixed the sticky key problem. Yeah. It's crazy. Hey Rob. I still have both of mine.
8082080	8085920	Oh, that's nice. That's good. I, my, uh, beat media controller should be around somewhere,
8085920	8091760	but, um, I've got two Japanese ones and two us ones. That's awesome. And I have,
8091760	8097680	I still have an official five key controller. Oh, fine. And an off-market five key controller.
8097680	8102240	I wish we had a pop and music controller. I wish we could revisit this stuff on home console,
8102240	8108160	but you know, I can't find my copy of Para Para. I have, I have my biscuits. I don't have a game.
8108800	8115840	I'm sure you could find a way to play it. All right. Some other announcements from this week,
8115840	8120800	like we said it earlier in the show, it was a busy week. We had some announcements from El Gato. Um,
8120800	8125520	because, um, you know, more and more people are getting into streaming and influencing and that
8125520	8128800	sort of thing. Um, you know, and I was talking about this a little bit with Bobby on our,
8128800	8133440	our call tonight, but, um, you know, there's even whole sections at stores like Best Buy that are
8133440	8139120	dedicated to, so you want to be an influencer and some of the tech equipment that you need
8139120	8143280	for that. Well, no, I should actually, I promptly skipped that session, that section.
8144080	8149920	It's important. I reword this that they say you need, you don't need anything as you need drive.
8149920	8156480	You need a habit. You need, those are the things you need, but you do kind of need a computer.
8157360	8161600	Uh, if you have a phone, uh, if you had, there's other ways to do stuff. It just depends on what
8161600	8165760	you want to do. You don't necessarily like, and that's the thing about like the Best Buy
8165760	8172400	these things. It's not just about, uh, Twitch streaming. Maybe you want to do makeup tutorials
8172400	8180080	for YouTube. Maybe you want to, uh, film sketch comedy. Maybe you want to do the Tic Tac. Is that
8180080	8185360	what the kids are calling it? The Tic Tacs? You want to be a Tic Tac star? Uh, that's all along
8185360	8190240	with this too. So anyway, El Gato is kind of really trying to make itself like the, the
8190240	8195120	community, like four streamers. So they're releasing a lot of this, uh, stuff that's
8195120	8198400	branded for this. And they, they did a lot of announcements this week. They announced a new
8198400	8203520	mic arm. That's like a hundred dollars. That'll make your, uh, mic cable transparent and all that
8203520	8208320	stuff by hiding it inside the arm. Uh, they announced a new version of the stream deck with
8208320	8214160	customizable faceplates. Woo. Pop them on and off and change them. Sure. I do want the new stream
8214160	8220880	deck because I'm using the mini. Yeah. Um, and, uh, one of the other announcements they made
8220880	8226640	though, and I do think this is interesting is their own new webcam. So an El Gato branded
8226640	8230880	webcam. And what I think is interesting about, so they're calling it the face cam.
8230880	8236960	And what's interesting about this is it's taking cues from why a lot of people buy the really
8236960	8242640	expensive 500, $600 cameras, and then hook them up as webcams on their computer, even though that's
8242640	8248240	not what they're really for. So what they're trying to do, it's not 4k. So it is missing that,
8248240	8253280	but, uh, through this El Gato software, which we have to remember is also a big part of what
8253280	8259360	El Gato does is all the software to support what it does, um, is that through the camera hub,
8259360	8265520	you can do contrast, exposure, white balance. Uh, you basically, you can format and like the
8265520	8271760	lighting and the way it's reading and all that stuff. You can make it kind of look like a really
8271760	8277840	expensive camera through like the software and through the face cam. So kind of interesting,
8277840	8281280	although it should be noted, it has to be plugged in your system directly. It doesn't seem to work
8281360	8285760	through a hub. That's what a lot of the early reviews are saying, uh, is that, uh, and also,
8285760	8292320	um, you, it needs, it's going to meet, you need USB-C for the high speed. Um, so something to
8292320	8299840	look at there. I think it's interesting though. It's $200, but it's a higher end webcam. So,
8299840	8305680	um, yeah, I mean, I don't know how well they'd run on the, well, no, it's, it's just a camera,
8305680	8309520	so it should run fine as long as the software works on the Mac, but I would consider getting
8309520	8316000	one for the studio. So it'd be interesting. Um, Bobby in chat says I stream in 720 P so it's
8316000	8320320	fine. Oh, talking about like the whole 4k and all that. Yeah. Yeah. Unless you're doing like full
8320320	8325360	face cam face stuff, like, you know, on YouTube or something like that, you know, but even then
8325360	8329760	you'd probably have a DSLR anyway. So for most things it's going to be fine. You're not going
8329760	8335360	to be 4k shrunken down to like a tiny little thing in the corner. I know people that use 4k cameras
8335360	8340800	and it looks great. It looks really good. Like not going to lie. Um, but it's probably not,
8340800	8344480	I would say you'd probably get more value out of that. If you double it up, like you're using it
8344480	8349520	as like, not just your webcam, but you do other kinds of shoots with it too. I'm using a 4k camera,
8350320	8358560	your phone using my phone. Yeah. So the quality is even better because I paid for the app for,
8358560	8363840	um, to link it up to OBS and it looks even better because it'll do it in full 4k on OBS. I mean,
8363840	8368800	my streaming isn't that high, but it will do it. But even though discord, you know, squishes it
8368800	8373040	down just because that's the nature of how we have to record it. If you were sending me a 4k image
8373040	8377120	that I, I, my system wouldn't be able to keep up. So, um, but it still looks good.
8377760	8385520	I'm using one called camo studio to do for a discord. And I mean, it's, it's 720 P,
8385520	8392000	but it's, uh, you know, HD, it looks good. It's 30 frames per second, which is fine for discord.
8392000	8400480	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, speaking of new releases, I think this one's great. Dark Sakura.
8403680	8411360	Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Um, wait. Oh yeah. You know what? I completely didn't open the story.
8412480	8419200	My bad. It's all right. I need one. You want to tell us about it? No,
8419200	8422960	I'm going to go buy one now. Bye. You want competition on the pre-orders.
8424320	8427760	So LG is doing
8429920	8437120	a great brand new TV that, you know, everyone's going to need it. Everyone's going to want this.
8437680	8452320	Um, it's, uh, a 17 inch, uh, four, three CRT television. It is the LG Siri S E R I E one.
8453120	8459600	Um, and yeah, it's a, it's classic CRT. It has a Famicom hookup hooked up to it in the picture.
8459600	8464960	Oh, that's awesome. See, finally, somebody coming to the rescue of all of these old CRTs,
8464960	8468800	which if you don't know what that is, that, that talks about the tube that's inside those
8468800	8472880	old televisions. That's what they have. The fat backs that are very heavy. Those are all
8474400	8479840	which all your old arcade machines have them, all our old retro systems ran on them.
8479840	8484640	And so, you know, as those CRTs are dying and nobody makes them anymore until now,
8485440	8490080	you know, they're very hard to replace and some people don't, especially with retro.
8490080	8494320	What? This story is from 2010. What?
8497040	8502480	Who put this in for this week? I went back and looked at the date.
8504720	8511520	And yeah. All right. Sorry guys. Somebody put it in there, sold out. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
8511520	8517200	the webpage is gone. Somebody, uh, put it in the pool for this week. So that's, uh,
8517200	8523280	an oops on our part. How did that get dug up all these years later? Well, that happens.
8523280	8529920	You know what? Old news circulates sometimes comes back up because I'm sure somebody must've
8529920	8537040	pulled it from social media or something like that. Well, um, Hey, Ubisoft is, uh, doing a
8537040	8542640	brand new Tom Clancy game. Yeah. See, so not to throw anybody under the bus, but dark to see a
8542640	8548720	posted it on our forums or on our little thing and says, I came across this on Twitter.
8549360	8555360	So it's still floating around right now. As this is what I tell people on Facebook,
8555360	8562000	on Twitter, on everything, check the date. I'm with Tay announced in 2010,
8562000	8565680	but due to global supply chain issues, it'll be released next month.
8565840	8573760	That I'm mad because I want one Nintendo TV. Maybe it is with a Famicom attached to it, but
8574720	8580560	yeah. All right. Things happen. And you know what, again, if it was making the rounds on
8580560	8586080	Twitter, here's some really notable news. Hmm. Among Us has been translated into Irish Gaelic.
8586640	8593440	Oh, that's random, but cool. Yeah. All right. Uh, I think we have another story here and I
8593520	8600560	think this is Loki's. Yeah. So, um, we can, I guess, talk a little bit about how
8601440	8608880	Mario is got this unique version that's been donated now to, uh, a museum. So there was a
8608880	8616240	rare PC port of super Mario brothers three, uh, that was being worked on by its software,
8616240	8622960	or I guess in this case, it's ideas from the deep and, um, it never came to fruition,
8622960	8628480	but they did put a demo out or like start working on a demo. And now it's in the Strong National
8628480	8635920	Museum of Play, which is in Rochester, New York. Um, but yeah, it says the individual who donated
8635920	8642400	it was a game developer and it was something that they didn't expect to see, but, um, something that
8642400	8647760	at least they'd heard was rumored to be a thing. Um, what's interesting though is since the
8647760	8653920	development didn't go forward with it, they use the effort that they put into it. And, um,
8655040	8660720	I guess maybe even some of the code or whatever to develop to commander keen. I knew it. I knew
8660720	8665040	the first time I played that commander keen, I'm like, this is just super Mario brothers three,
8665760	8670480	but like, you know, and this is back in, back in the day, but is it, you know, and again,
8670480	8675840	the Mario PC thing isn't new news because again, that, that I know, uh, the video was out, you know,
8675920	8680080	several years ago when this was first brought up and everything. But, um, the news here is that
8680080	8685280	now other people will get to see it in a museum. It's not just this, you know, kind of secret thing
8685280	8690640	that is like one video of it exists that was put out there. Um, that's just kind of cool, but like,
8690640	8696880	I, and even if you go back and watch that video now, you hear so much of like commander keen in
8696880	8704080	it. It's so interesting. Yeah. Um, pretty cool. Yeah. As Joe and Hunter Matt says,
8704080	8707440	I'm like an hour from this museum. Now I'll have to go there at some point.
8707440	8715280	Yeah. Give us the scoop. Tell us what it's all about. Uh, I made a bad dad joke. Yes, I saw,
8715280	8721280	I saw. And for more of that, you can join our chat. All right. Yeah. No one special in chat
8721280	8730000	says commander. Keen was one of my first steam purchases in 2013. Hmm. Interesting. All right.
8730800	8734240	Let's move on. I got one more story for you guys, and then we're going to wrap up for the night.
8734880	8741840	Uh, and that has to do with a classic game called chips challenge and chips challenge. A lot of
8741840	8749440	folks know from, uh, I think it was in like an old windows expansion thing. Uh, for a classic game
8749440	8755040	while I was out once. Yeah. I'm pretty sure we had to have, yeah. It was a windows game collection
8755040	8758000	or something like that. I can't remember what it was called, but I had it. I remember there's like
8758000	8765280	a windows 95 or one of those, like a game expansion thing. Yeah. Well, there's a console
8765280	8770160	port coming for this game. Uh, it's coming for the super Nintendo and I believe the Genesis as well.
8770160	8776480	Yeah. A company called retro room games is remaking the Microsoft entertainment pack. That's
8776480	8782640	it. That's it. Uh, it was originally on the links in 1989. I knew it was like an early game for one
8782640	8787040	of those. I think I have a copy for links. I think everybody has a copy of this game somewhere. And
8787040	8792240	again, I've mentioned this on the show before the guy who originally made this game is actually
8792240	8796880	somebody I know through other like games where he lives here. So I need to, I need not here,
8796880	8800160	but he lives in the area. So I need to have him on the show at some point. Cause now,
8800160	8804560	especially that this is news, uh, I'd be very curious to get his take on all this thing.
8804560	8808480	So maybe I'll have to do that. I'll have to send him an email or a message and see if he's willing
8808480	8816960	to come on the show. Um, but yeah. Uh, so, uh, let's see. This is going to, uh, of course. Oh,
8816960	8821760	yeah. The chips challenge had the, uh, re-release on steam in 2015. And then there was a chips
8821760	8829520	challenge too as well. Um, so yeah, now you can get a new pal or NTSC format, super Nintendo and
8829520	8834400	Sega Genesis version of this. Uh, there is a box and instruction manual, just like the way games
8834400	8840160	used to be. Uh, and then a 49 99, if you want to get the box, the instructions and all that
8840160	8845040	good stuff, 24 99, if you just want the cart by itself, which I think is an interesting option
8845040	8850800	in a way to do it. So they're still making super Nintendo games in the year 2021. How about that?
8850800	8858320	And a classic at that. Pretty cool. All right. Any other old ass games you want to see ported
8858320	8868800	to an old ass system? Uh, maybe, maybe, uh, doctor says they gave it away on steam. I have
8868800	8872480	it in my collection. I remember playing it as abandonware, but I really like it. Yeah.
8873040	8878080	So it's a fun game. It's a classic. All right. Let's get to our next segment,
8878080	8882640	which is the listener round table. Uh, so every week we invite your questions via our chat room
8882640	8888960	over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And we also appreciate your emails over at participate at
8888960	8895840	orange lounge, radio.com is the place to send your emails. Um, so we'd like to, uh, welcome that now,
8895840	8900240	except I don't think we have any emails this week, right? Nope. Well, that's unfortunate.
8900240	8904720	You should send us more emails. Um, but that's all right. I understand. Uh, usually when we
8904720	8908640	don't get any emails, uh, it's an excuse for dark soccer and I to talk about drag race.
8909200	8914880	I'm still behind. I don't. Yeah. I don't think I have a lot to say. You do that. I will say
8914880	8918960	this current season, this all-star six is, you know, for as much shit as it got for being on
8918960	8924000	paramount plus as opposed to VH one. I think I understand now why they did this season,
8924000	8928480	because it's a really good season. It's probably the best all-star since two. I mean,
8928480	8932240	ask me again when it's over. Cause it could have a shitty ending like all-stars three.
8932240	8937120	Uh, although I love the queen that won all stars three. I, we all hate how that last episode went
8937120	8942160	down. We all know it was, it just made everything look bad. Um, I think it took away from that
8942160	8947280	queen's win, which is unfortunate. Um, but anyway, uh, so ask me when all-stars six is over,
8947280	8951200	but so far it's on track to be one of like the better seasons, uh, of all-stars.
8951200	8955440	So you'll have to check it out. All right. We'll make that quick discussion tonight.
8955440	8960320	Let's talk about other stuff. Uh, how about last minute stories? If you have any, um,
8960400	8968400	I do. So take two is removing some old grand theft auto mods using DMZ take down notices.
8968400	8974960	This showed up on our discord. Yeah. Yeah. So they're doing that on mod DB. Um, there's several
8974960	8980320	pretty big and yet pretty old mods. Like for example, GTA Liberty city, which was a
8980320	8986160	toll conversion of vice city that brought, um, Liberty city from GTA three into the vice city
8986160	8991360	engine, uh, GTA underground, which merged, I guess, several of the maps from different
8991360	8998800	games together. And those had received different takedown notices. Basically, it sounds like that
8998800	9003840	the re they're going to re-release these games is what it sounds like to me, but, um, they've tried
9003840	9010160	to do this in the past with other things. There was that whole, um, I think where they re reverse
9010160	9016720	engineered the code for, I think it was vice city or grant without three and basically, um,
9017280	9022000	you know, where you built the games and poured on the different things. Um, so they had taken
9022000	9026080	it down at one time. And since the code was original, it was all based off of like kind
9026080	9030720	of figuring it out that, you know, they really couldn't do anything. So they put that back
9030720	9036640	online. Um, but yeah, this isn't, this isn't the first time that they've tried to swing that
9036640	9041200	around, but I mean, this stuff's been on the internet forever. It's probably not going to go
9041200	9048160	away. All right. Not on a mod DB. So I'm going to do something a little different here that I
9048160	9053440	haven't done in a very long time. And maybe you can consider this a pilot of sorts for a particular
9053440	9059200	feature here on the show to come back. Um, I'm going to do this live, but somebody wanted to
9059200	9063840	call in and talk to us tonight. And I think that is a lovely idea. So I would like to welcome to
9063840	9069520	the show tonight, our voiceover man, mr. Jason is with us tonight. Hi, Jason.
9070160	9074880	One of the few times that I get more than 13 seconds to endlessly,
9074880	9081360	uh, are you going on cam tonight or no? I did not think about it. No. For the sake of time. No.
9081360	9085600	Then let me go back. Okay. Well, that's gonna, all right. That's fine. That's the joy of doing
9085600	9089280	this live is that you have, uh, all that. All right. That's all right. We'll figure it out.
9089280	9094800	Uh, hi. Uh, so what is on your mind? Yes. I, I, and the listeners need to understand
9095680	9103040	you. Thanklessly do the intro, the outro and all that stuff every week here on the show.
9103040	9106720	So, you know what, if you've got something to say, well, God damn it, I'm going to make sure
9106720	9111200	you get to come in here and say it because you know, you do so much for OLR. And I really hope
9111200	9116800	people understand that, um, O O L R really wouldn't happen the way it does if it wasn't for you. So
9116800	9123120	yeah, I absolutely appreciate that. And I'm always willing to throw in however possible. And
9123120	9127120	a lot of my participation has been exactly that it's like, Hey, I want to see this thing better.
9127120	9133600	So boom, let's do that. Um, I, I wanted to talk about, uh, a theme, like a lot of,
9133600	9139120	a lot of the intros I do are typically just for fun and I tend to avoid the headline because the
9139120	9142480	headline is the most obvious thing. You're going to spend the most time on it. Everybody's heard
9142480	9145600	about it. I don't need to use my time in that. So let's do something a little bit different.
9146400	9153120	This week is the, uh, exactly as I said for E3, uh, you know, last month, the, uh, the,
9153120	9157760	the very quiet intro, making the joke about how I don't like repeating myself, which is a hundred
9157760	9164000	percent true thing about myself. Um, E3 is happening. Well, uh, you know, completely
9164000	9169280	unsurprising news of the week. Um, but like the theme of this night that was kind of running
9169280	9173920	around my head has been really interesting too, because we talk that the continual evolution of
9173920	9181520	gaming platforms and systems and everything else and our particular arrangement on it, you, Rob,
9181520	9188400	you said the very same thing that I, that, that, that applies to me. I work from home.
9188400	9198160	If I commute, it's me driving. Um, I am intensely interested in the steam deck, but I don't know
9198160	9204240	where it fits in in my life. Um, because yeah, like my, my switch is generally docked. I don't
9204240	9210880	take it with me when I go somewhere because I'm the driver. Same. I'm I'm with you obviously.
9210880	9216480	Yeah. We're on the same page there. It's like, I don't do a lot. The most portable gaming I do
9216480	9221520	is when I'm flying, when I'm on airplanes, when was the last time I got on a plane here in the
9221520	9227760	year 2021, it's been a long time. Now I am planning to attend dragon con. Um, that is still
9227760	9233440	on the table. Um, as a vaccinated individual, I know what my risks are. I don't have children.
9233440	9238480	I'm not worried that if I were to somehow catch COVID during all this, you know, as a, again,
9238480	9244000	being vaccinated, I'm going to be fine. I don't have any kids to pass it to. Um, I plan to hang
9244000	9248080	out with other vaccinated individuals at dragon con. I'm going to cut back on some of the big,
9248080	9253200	big stuff, uh, that usually happens. But anyway, my point is I'm going out there. I do plan to fly.
9253200	9257360	That's the only time I'll probably actually play the switch, not in docked mode. Uh,
9257360	9264960	he's doing, and to sync sync multiple hundreds of dollars in for, uh, you know, not, not a one-off
9264960	9270320	use, but by no means a regular use as a heck of an investment to make in that kind of a situation.
9270320	9273760	Yeah. And so like, as I've gotten, as I've gotten more and more into, uh,
9274000	9282480	uh, big daddy businessman pants, um, it, it frustrates me to, to have the adult mentality
9282480	9288320	about it, that I want to know what steam's expectations are. And I think like, this is,
9288320	9293520	this is why, um, journalists, non-investing journalists getting in and investor calls has
9293520	9298880	been such a big thing. I want to know what their targets are because the actual number of people
9298960	9307920	that I expect to buy the steam, uh, the, uh, the steam deck at a given price point off being offset
9307920	9313520	with how much of a certain skew they produce, uh, if they're taking a loss on the hardware,
9313520	9318080	which they do because they have, you know, they have their, their cut of all of the gobs and gobs
9318080	9323040	of software they sell. Um, like I want to know where their expectation is in order to
9323040	9332320	you expect the longevity of this device, because it is a subset of a subset PC gamers have PCs.
9332320	9339280	I, you know, some people may, you know, uh, families, multiple kids, all this kind of stuff.
9339280	9344480	There's a, there's a place for playing it on TV and a big group playing it on the TV when the
9344480	9350400	computers otherwise in use, uh, school children, for example, those sorts of things. But that's a,
9350400	9356880	you know, that's, that's a subset. And the second subset is people that don't already have
9356880	9362560	consistent means of accessing something. Those people that today would go to a library,
9362560	9367520	which isn't conducive to gaming a land center, which is, but is less, you know, less available
9367520	9375280	around the U S and around the world. Um, it's, it's the target seems so small, but it is such
9375280	9383120	a compelling idea. You know, I do really like the concept of that. It's basically like an,
9383120	9386960	especially in this day and age where we live in now where it's, it's impossible to get new graphics
9386960	9391840	cards and some of these things, I kind of like that. It's almost like a, a, a entry-level PC
9391840	9398000	of sorts. Like I almost wonder if the steam deck wouldn't have a purpose as being a kid's computer
9398000	9404320	to do their homework on a relatively cheap way of doing that. I mean, okay. Yeah, you have,
9404320	9409040	you know, you can get a really cheap Chromebook to do a lot of that, I'm sure. But I like this
9409040	9412960	as kind of like the net. Like we all know, like you get what you pay for with a hundred dollar
9412960	9420080	laptop, you get a hundred dollar laptop. You're going to have the web Skype. You're not really
9420080	9424400	gonna play games on it, right? I like, this is kind of like a middle ground where it's like,
9424400	9429520	and you can play quite a few games too on this. It may not be top of the line. It may not be the
9429520	9436560	biggest graphics fidelity, but it kind of works as like a basic PC for a college kid or a high
9436560	9442480	school kid. I think that is very fascinating to me. Yeah. And then Jamie said the same thing,
9442480	9449040	me and her are completely in agreement about this. That like we being Linux using technically
9449040	9453760	sophisticated, technically, technically, technically broad and experimental individuals
9453760	9460720	could absolutely go to town on this for that particular. Yeah. And I've given some thought
9460720	9466640	to SteamOS again today in lieu of these announcements, because I knew it used to be
9467200	9473040	Debian based. I always mix up if it was Debian Ubuntu, but I only recently learned that they
9473040	9478160	moved to Arch, which everybody is figuring is going to be what's going to be backing,
9478160	9481680	what's going to be backing the device physically when it comes out, assuming there is no big
9481680	9486240	other change since then in as much as a Linux distribution actually matters, blah, blah, blah,
9486240	9493840	blah, blah. And so I completely agree with you with everything that you said, Rob, but reiterate
9493840	9499440	that that's a subset of a subset. This is advertised to gamers. So for somebody to realize,
9499440	9504400	oh, I can use this couple hundred dollar gaming thing for all of these other purposes.
9504400	9508080	If you would still need to buy a keyboard, you could, you probably are only going to use
9508080	9515280	schoolwork stuff when docked on a screen to which conversely, yes, those cheaper laptops that are
9515280	9522640	actually laptops, general advertisers, general purpose exist. The pie for hundreds in particular,
9522640	9527440	the the computer in the keyboard models, I have one. Those things are friggin superb.
9528560	9532800	And they're even cheaper. I think it's important to say, though, that is all in the marketing.
9532800	9536960	And that would be things that they could bring up in year two and year three. For example,
9537680	9543680	Beyonce did not appear in ads for the Nintendo 3DS the first year. No, they got her to do those
9543680	9550400	ads when that thing was already four or five years old to try to reach more people. In other words,
9550400	9555360	anybody who likes any type of music, because Beyonce is, you know, universal in the music world.
9556320	9559680	But you get what I'm saying, like, you know, those types of like celebrity endorsements and things
9559680	9563920	like that, those don't come until you usually I mean, of course, I'm sure and chat, you're
9563920	9567040	probably gonna say, but what about this? What about this? Yes, of course, there's exceptions
9567040	9571520	to every rule. But usually those types of big celebrity endorsements and that expansion of,
9571520	9578320	you know, what is this for comes later in the cycle. So I think it's it's subcultural. It's
9578320	9584720	subcultural endorsement. Let's take an example. Tommy Tallarico. It's subcultural before it's
9584720	9589760	mainstream cultural when you have demonstrated your success, the value that you can provide in
9589760	9594320	both directions. Yeah, absolutely. And that's that's the give and take like valve. What is
9594320	9601280	when has valve ever marketed that you conversely to that valve markets through steam like have they
9601280	9607760	ever had a TV commercial like they could have a banner ad but outside of their service like where
9607760	9616000	else do you hear about steam? Where else do you hear about valves products by valve outside of
9616000	9620880	steam? Um, I wonder there could there there could legitimately be answers to this. I don't
9620880	9628320	I don't watch TVs. I use ad blockers. You know, I'm I'm actually I'm actually I'm legitimately
9628320	9633200	asking this at large. I'm not expecting the direct answer from you. But like because I avoid
9633200	9638320	advertisements like the plague. I am actually just not exposed to this kind of thing. And I'm a bad
9638320	9644720	barometer for mainstream advertising. Um, I guess my quick answer to that is but you know about it.
9644720	9648400	So they got you somehow. No, they didn't get you through advertising. But you know about
9648400	9654320	as I read because I read these new right. I'm in this community. They have the techies. They need
9654320	9659440	to advertise in the non techie spaces when they're ready to recruit those people. I think that's my
9659440	9664080	short and sweet kind of response to that, I guess. All right. Um, I do want to answer this, though,
9664080	9669520	because I actually you know, I love your chatters. The part of why you guys are here is so that we
9669520	9673600	have diverse opinions and discussion and things like that. I'm going to say to this comment,
9673600	9680320	I really disagree. And Rama, sorry, but it's you. Rama says, Oh, dang, I scrolled it off the
9680320	9683360	screen. Now I've called them out. And then I don't even have the receipts here to read.
9683360	9689360	How did Oh, there it is. The steam deck is just Gabe thumbing his nose at Nintendo. Nothing else
9689360	9695040	more. I super disagree with that statement, actually. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.
9695040	9702080	And Rama, I will give you this. I do it is the steam deck a response of sorts to the Nintendo
9702080	9708560	Switch. Yes, that part I will agree. Did they think about the steam deck before they ever
9708560	9713120	saw a Nintendo Switch? I doubt it. Not in this form that it's in now anyway, they might have
9713120	9720880	thought about like portable, you know, but they I think the switch paved the way for this to exist.
9720880	9727280	That being said, go ahead, Jimmy. Just bear in mind also to research and development time.
9727280	9733200	Yes, that so it can't be a reaction to this new switch, it had to have been in process for a
9733200	9740320	while. That being said, if I'm at Nintendo, and I'm seeing this right now, I don't give a shit.
9740880	9745520	Like I'm looking at this going, that's really interesting. But I remember they ever at the
9745520	9749920	end of the day, they're not going to give a shit like and they didn't do that with the PSP or any
9749920	9756160	that other stuff. And the reason why is because let's not forget what Nintendo is very good at
9756960	9763200	making games. And Nintendo Switch is always going to be the only place you can play Mario,
9764080	9772320	Zelda, Metroid, and all of those Pokemon. That is why now going back to what you are, you know,
9772320	9776480	and giving again, I'm not like saying like, everything you say is wrong. I there there
9776480	9782000	are elements of this that I do think work here, going back to what I said earlier. Now,
9782960	9789760	this is why I am surprised. And if valve really was trying to punch Nintendo in the face here,
9790320	9796240	this is what you would have seen. This is why I'm surprised valve did not have the valve game
9796800	9803680	that is better on this thing that is not going to come out on Nintendo Switch ie portal three ie
9803680	9809840	left for dead three ie half life three. There is no half life three you stupid slut.
9812640	9823120	Yeah, this whole this whole especially for for three hosts that have been doing a show for a
9823120	9831920	human's entire developmental life. Like we can we can take this conversation back endlessly. People
9831920	9838960	people see a steam link. Jesus. They see a stream dreck. Oh, I mean, God, these freaking words this
9838960	9844880	week have been a nightmare. People see a steam deck and visually draw an immediate contrast to
9844880	9853360	the switch. But the only thing that a steam deck is, is a steam controller and an untethered steam
9853360	9861280	machine. This is not like, you know, a completely a completely copy paste job or new in the making
9861280	9866880	development of valves own products. This isn't a new like this isn't a new development in the PC
9866880	9874720	series. There was a series of PCs back in the mid aughts. I think I even remember it in high school.
9874720	9880800	There was a computer that was basically like a T T mobile sidekick a hip top sidekick called the
9880800	9888320	O Q O. That was the same fucking thing with a physical keyboard. Even to this day, I saw
9888320	9894240	somebody saying, hey, to to to denounce to downplay the oh, they're they're doing they're targeting
9894240	9901040	Nintendo. The GPD win has existed for I actually don't even know how long I'm gonna I'm gonna say I
9901040	9906720	think they're already on the third iteration of that. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, so and Rama Rama's
9906720	9911520	pushing back a little bit here and I understand I get it. And I want to bring in some of the same
9911520	9916000	stuff you're bringing up Jason. So says Rama says in chat when the switch became this popular,
9916000	9920000	let's not forget that there are other manufacturers doing the same thing. I present
9920000	9925360	the Aya Neo and the GPD win two and three. So you're wrong, my friend. So here's the thing and
9925360	9930560	then goes on to say same thing, man, Nintendo created others want to copy. In that kind of
9930560	9936000	context, I think we do have some similar ground. But there's a difference in my opinion between
9936000	9941120	that and doing something to kind of like get at Nintendo or challenge Nintendo. Here's the
9941120	9947760	parallel that comes to my mind. I don't know who did it first. In my mind, it was Oreo that did it
9947760	9953760	first. And let me explain what that is. What Oreo did first, I think, was they started putting out
9953760	9959440	all of those fucking flavors. And I mean, a lot of fucking flavors. I mean, there's the Oreo
9960240	9964240	peanut butter. There's the Oreo strawberry. There's the Oreos that taste like
9964480	9970720	a s'mores. There's the Oreos that taste like carrot cake. They probably have ass Oreos at
9970720	9977680	this point for those. If you if you love ass, have an ass Oreo. That is probably a thing that exists.
9977680	9984480	My point. Everybody saw what was happening with Oreo and was like, huh, that's a pretty good idea.
9984480	9989280	Let's try that our way. They're not necessarily doing it to compete with Oreo. They're doing it
9989360	9994960	to expand their own longevity. And what I'm talking about is breakfast cereals. Now you
9994960	9999760	go into the store and granted, of course, Nabisco is one of the cereal makers, so they probably
9999760	10003520	stole from themselves. But you also have General Mills and other companies. And now it's oops,
10003520	10010080	all berries, which is memed all the time now. Right. As a flavor or banana frosted flakes,
10010080	10015280	which is the fucking yummiest flavor thing I have ever had. Does it does it taste like the
10015440	10022320	extinct Cavendish or like current bananas? It it tastes good. That's all I know is that
10023280	10029520	and all of those other banana flavoring. Right. Yes. Now there's now there's wheat thins in all
10029520	10035600	sorts of different flavors. You name it. There's a million different flavors. And I kind of so. So
10035600	10041920	my my comparison here is that I think it's more that valve saw Nintendo making a new,
10041920	10047280	making a new flavor here and going, huh, we should try doing what we do in a similar flavor.
10048160	10052880	But that's not to say that, oh, now you're no longer going to buy Oreos because you're going
10052880	10058480	to buy this. I think it's that both can actually kind of coexist side by side for a lot of people.
10059520	10067440	Say nothing of the DSP, the PS Vita. Yes. If you don't have if you've got the disposable income
10067440	10073120	for it, buy whatever the fuck you want. End of story. Yeah. Yeah. Whoever, whoever,
10073120	10077360	whoever was first, whoever was best, like all those arguments are always going to happen.
10077360	10081920	And they're, they're, they're moot because in the grand scheme of things,
10083520	10088960	the grand scheme of things is made up of every individual story and exactly as Jamie just said,
10090080	10095600	get in it for you. Do what it is for you. You do have to calculate, you know,
10095600	10099520	you do have to consider the longevity, you know, if this flops and steam discontinues it,
10099520	10107680	what does that mean for breakage and repair? How long did I link my Engage? Let my Engage along.
10111120	10116960	How long did Loki keep Azuya before he sold it off? Not long. I got it. I got to wrap up because
10116960	10121840	we're almost to midnight, but I think that this steam deck conversation is certainly not going
10121840	10126160	away at the end of the day. I want to play one. I feel like there is a lot I'm saying here. That's
10126160	10131360	just kind of like feeling, um, because I haven't had my hands on one yet. I feel like I can answer
10131360	10135760	a lot more about how does it really compare to a switch once I actually play it right now. It's
10135760	10140560	just thoughts anyway, Jason, great topic. Anything else you want to say before we let you go and wrap
10140560	10146320	up the show tonight? We opine because we can't opine and we are here to provide insight and
10146320	10153120	consideration to people. A system is only good as the games that are on it. Your choice is your
10153120	10158400	choice for your own reasons. You do the research. Jason, thanks so much for being on the show and
10158400	10164240	thanks again for all you do. And I would say this pilot was a bit of a success. So for those of you
10164240	10168160	that have been asking for this to come back, I think we'll have to look into that. So thanks,
10168160	10172880	Jason. You take care. Are we making a note here? Huge success. All right. I'm going to pull you
10172880	10178800	out of the chat. Take care, Jason. Later. All right. There we go. That worked out very well.
10180880	10185840	And at the end of the day, I only play fight with Rama. It's not a real fight. I play fight with
10185840	10191680	Rama because he's one of my favorite people and I know I can do that with him. Let's see. Lots of
10191680	10196800	great stuff in chat right now. The one other comment I wanted to read, because it is also
10196880	10204560	topical. It has to do with that comment about the Microsoft tweet as Joe and her map
10205520	10210960	says. God damn it, it keeps going on the screen. Listen, the official Xbox Twitter account said
10210960	10216560	this week to the people in our replies saying PS five is better. The best console is the one
10216560	10225280	you enjoy playing. Have fun. That's a very. Exactly. It's such a different perspective
10225280	10232400	on things than the days of Genesis does what Nintendo don't. It's now I feel like everybody's
10232400	10237760	holding hands and singing. We're all in this together. And maybe that has to do. This has
10237760	10244160	to do something with maybe the state of the games industry where unfortunately layoffs, closures
10244160	10249600	and change in the industry is so common that people really do create a big family of sorts in
10249600	10254800	the game development industry where it's really about, you know, holding hands with each other
10254880	10265760	and not necessarily. Wanting to fight. So anyway. Good, good discussion. I did see one other
10265760	10268880	question chat that I thought was worth a quick, quick discussion before we wrap up tonight.
10269440	10272960	No one special had asked, and I'm going to paraphrase here because it scrolled off the
10272960	10278800	screen. But what is the worst game you have ever played? The worst video game you've ever played.
10278800	10284000	And I thought that was a cute question. So WCW Thunder. And why was it the worst?
10285280	10289440	Well, it was so bad that an hour after bringing it home,
10289440	10293920	Dan and I turned around and took it back to blockbuster. It was that bad.
10293920	10296720	Oh, yes, I remember that. I do. Hey, you stop it.
10300000	10308560	Don't confuse the PC version with mobile, OK? The point I do taste isn't a lot of people I
10308560	10313440	watch stream dead by daylight say this is that behavior gets away with a lot of shit.
10314000	10320320	Like behavior is sometimes resting on those licenses that they have that, you know,
10320320	10325120	create the multiverse of horror films and that that game is so fucking buggy. Sometimes they
10325120	10329440	really do get away with a lot. So, yeah. Right. It's a crazy addiction.
10330080	10335360	Tay says, I hate that fucking cursed game, but I can't stop playing it. That's a discussion for
10335360	10341840	another week. What is a fucking cursed thing you can't stop doing? Whether that's playing a game
10341840	10348880	or whatever it is. All right. Let's see. So so dark soccer, I know you're going to bow out so
10348880	10353840	you can set up for the post stream. Yeah. Anything last you thought you want to get
10353840	10359120	out here while we give our own worst games and then wrap up here. Have your neighbors
10359120	10364320	spayed and neutered. All right. Thank you, Jamie. I wish I could sometimes,
10364320	10372640	but it's already too late. No, just just find one person, just one person that you interact with
10373440	10380000	and say something really kind to them. That's all do one kind act. OK, I want to see where it goes.
10381120	10385040	All right. Take care, Jamie. Thanks for being here. We'll see you in a little bit.
10385680	10389840	All right. Loki, do you have a worst game you've ever played?
10389840	10397120	I'm sure I blocked it from my memory if I did. The only thing that sort of
10398240	10401600	I can kind of vaguely remember Bullet Witch and that was terrible.
10406160	10410160	That's the only one I could think of right now, because if it was so bad, I wouldn't remember it.
10410720	10418800	Fusion Frenzy two on the Xbox 360. Yeah, that is very terrible. Fucking garbage, hot Mario party.
10418800	10425120	I thought it was going to be, but it was not garbage. That was a bad game. I remember some
10425120	10430240	eight bit knockoff games, too, like from the companies that couldn't even get the actual
10430240	10436320	Nintendo seal of approval. I like Back to the Future two and three, because like I bought
10436320	10440560	Back to the Future two and three because I saw like Nintendo Power Cover, like the original
10440560	10446640	Back to the Future NES game. And those games were not like the Back to the Future one game.
10447200	10453600	They were very different and not very good. My other answer and all my music game fans out there
10453600	10456480	and the roots of our show and everything, listen up, because I know you're going to agree with
10456480	10462560	this answer. Worst game I've ever played? Beat and Groovy, the American version of pop music
10462560	10469440	on the Xbox 360. Fucking terrible. Oh, yeah. Pop culture says Lollipop Chainsaw. You know,
10469440	10476240	that game had it looked like it had potential, but yeah. All right. Let's wrap up and get
10476240	10479840	final thoughts and close up shop here tonight. Or actually, I don't know if you have any other
10479840	10482320	last minute stories quickly, Loki? I don't.
10482320	10486000	Okay. We're after nine o'clock anyway, which is midnight on the East Coast. So we do want
10486000	10492320	to wrap up. Final thoughts. We are at the end of the show. Thank you very much for tuning in.
10492320	10497200	And whether you participated with us live on Twitch, or if you downloaded our podcast on
10497200	10501360	Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is you listen to podcasts, please help us spread the word.
10501360	10504640	Tell a friend about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10504640	10511040	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, auto hosts on Twitch, they go an awful long way
10511040	10515440	as well. And we really appreciate those. You don't have to, but if you feel so inclined,
10515440	10520640	check out the shop over at vognetwork.com slash shop. We have some Orange Dance Radio t-shirts
10520640	10524320	and you can get some other merch for the Bobby Black Wolf show and VOG Network in general.
10524880	10528720	And I'm sure more to come in the future. So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash
10528720	10533520	shop if you are wanting some new threads or some stickers, lots of things in there.
10534640	10539040	That's it. Let's get final thoughts tonight. Loki, your final thoughts.
10539040	10543760	That's SSJ100. Matt says I got mad at some of the newer Saints Row games.
10543760	10547680	I was more disappointed in them. Like they could have been so much better.
10548240	10554960	Not necessarily mad. Now, probably if I played Agents of Mayhem, maybe I'd get mad. But no,
10554960	10559760	it's just that they had so much potential. I'm so I'm very like, let me put it this way, the next
10560320	10563920	Saints Row game Volition announces. I mean, I'm gonna buy it day one.
10564640	10569680	I don't care what four turned out like. I'm obviously going to drop money for that whenever
10569680	10575840	they announce that. And I will be happy to answer this question from Tay. What is the best way to
10575840	10580160	financially support the show directly? Thank you for that. That's very kind that people would want
10580160	10584480	to do that word of mouth and spreading the word. That's the number one thing we want. We've never
10584480	10588320	asked for money from the beginning. But yes, I know there's still people that say, but we want
10588320	10593520	to. And I really appreciate that. So yes, biddies and subs here on Twitch, like a lot of other
10593520	10598480	streamers on that does go back into the network. And especially as we're talking about sponsoring
10598480	10605120	conventions such as I believe VOG Network is sponsoring again, the Southern Fried Gaming Expo
10605120	10608640	that's coming back in a few weeks as I know Bobby brought it up on his show tonight. And he's doing
10608640	10613840	some panels there. And then as things start to come back on the West Coast, I'm hoping we can
10613840	10619520	do that as well. And that's going to really get the word out as well. That goes a long way. So
10619520	10623680	yes, biddies and subs and the shop is great too, because we do get a portion of those proceeds.
10623680	10627840	And then what I like about that is that you get something too. You get a shirt, you get a sticker,
10627840	10632400	you get whatever it is you want to buy. So honestly, any of those things we appreciate.
10632400	10638240	But yeah, word of mouth, bits, subs, it's all great. And we really appreciate it.
10638960	10644720	VOG Network is a legit business and that isn't cheap to do if you believe it or not. So it's
10644720	10651760	all because you have to pay for all the registration of your LLC and the PO box
10651760	10657120	that we have and all the stuff that kind of goes into it. So appreciate that very much.
10657120	10661120	And I'm really excited to get back out there and spread the word live at live events again.
10661120	10666800	I cannot wait for the next TwitchCon, which is interesting because I haven't been in years. The
10666800	10670720	first TwitchCon I went to kind of got me into wanting to do more Twitch streaming and live
10670720	10675920	streaming. I can't wait to go again. So anyway, we really do need to wrap up. My final thought,
10675920	10682080	that really kind of was a very long final thought, but I will also say I'm going to have, I will say
10682080	10687440	this is the final thought. I'm having surgery in about 10 days. It's nothing major. It's nothing
10687440	10692240	for you guys to be concerned about. I almost want to say it's a cosmetic procedure, but it's not.
10692240	10697040	It's not like I'm getting Botox or anything. You can't really see it here, but I have a thing on
10697040	10701200	the back of my neck and I've had it for years. And it's finally gotten to a point where it's
10701200	10705040	a little bit sore. And so we're going to get rid of it. So it's a, it's an IC, but it's an easy
10705040	10708560	thing. It's nothing to be concerned about, but still anytime you have surgery, it's kind of a
10708560	10714320	scary thing. So I appreciate any happy thoughts and all those sorts of things that you can send
10714320	10720640	my way. So I appreciate that. All right. That's it. We're going to be back in seven days to do
10720640	10724640	all again. Okay. Sound good. Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.
