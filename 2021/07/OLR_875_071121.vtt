WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
We're back and we're bringing you news from around the game universe while we bake

00:12.960 --> 00:14.840
in the 2021 heat dome.

00:14.840 --> 00:18.280
Cooking in the oven we have some evergreen stories of cheating, piracy, piracy being

00:18.280 --> 00:22.000
better than the official release and the unsurprising news that a Pokemon game nets billions of

00:22.000 --> 00:23.640
dollars during its existence.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.640
Also there's more Assassin's Creed coming, you get such a clock to news about that in

00:26.640 --> 00:27.640
Call of Duty.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.280
This is the non-exhaustive list of stories we're set to cover tonight and now it's time

00:30.280 --> 00:33.560
for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Logie to provide you with the details

00:33.560 --> 00:36.160
of these and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet.

00:38.160 --> 00:47.520
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.520 --> 00:53.200
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back after a little break for the holiday last

00:53.200 --> 01:00.120
week once again, live with episode number 875 of our show for tonight, July the 11th

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
of 2021.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.960
It has been a heck of a week.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.760
We'll talk all about that in just a moment, but first let me say hello.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.000
I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Hello.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.520
Hi, how are you?

01:14.520 --> 01:18.160
I have decided to be natural today.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.160
Yes.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
So that...

01:20.160 --> 01:26.040
I was just saying, you're going the natural makeup free, but you have an upgraded camera

01:26.040 --> 01:29.600
thing going on for those watching on Twitch, because I have to say this every week, we

01:29.600 --> 01:35.920
do tape live every Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network,

01:35.920 --> 01:39.720
the voice of geeks network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.800
Shout out to Bobby Black Wolf for an excellent job hosting that SGDQ, Summer Games Done Quick

01:44.800 --> 01:46.040
finale last night.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.940
We'll talk more about that in a little bit.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.700
Shout out to the raid we just got as well before we went live tonight.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.700
Thank you for that.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.940
He who is Steve, allegedly, supposedly Steve, if that is Steve's real name.

01:56.940 --> 01:57.940
No, thank you very much for the raid.

01:57.940 --> 02:01.940
Anyway, I was just saying your camera is all nice and fancy.

02:01.940 --> 02:06.580
Well, I was using like this knockoff GoPro looking thing.

02:06.580 --> 02:07.980
You ordered it off Wish.

02:07.980 --> 02:08.980
Just say it.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.280
You ordered it off Wish.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.460
I didn't order it off Wish, I ordered it on AliExpress.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.540
I thought it might be Wish.

02:14.540 --> 02:17.060
Which is only a step up.

02:17.060 --> 02:25.700
But I was doing some research and I was looking at getting a Logitech Brio, lots of money,

02:25.700 --> 02:26.700
right?

02:26.700 --> 02:28.740
And then I thought about it.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.140
It works so good.

02:30.140 --> 02:33.860
Loki, you be quiet till I introduce you.

02:33.860 --> 02:38.060
That's my turn.

02:38.060 --> 02:45.140
So what I ended up doing is I was looking at reviews of cameras and people were actually

02:45.140 --> 02:49.180
showing about using your iPhone as a camera.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.460
And I was like, why I have an iPhone?

02:52.460 --> 02:55.620
Why I have a Mac?

02:55.620 --> 03:01.300
And I can tell you that, first of all, I have two different apps that I'm using and one

03:01.300 --> 03:06.500
of them I use for OBS that has an even higher resolution and even less latency.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.380
The one I have to use for this, and this is just like the free version.

03:10.380 --> 03:15.580
So it's only 720p, but it looks great.

03:15.580 --> 03:26.420
The iPhone camera is miles above any on the market capture device short of using a professional

03:26.420 --> 03:28.820
4K camera with a conversion.

03:28.820 --> 03:31.900
And this is basically the equivalent of doing it.

03:31.900 --> 03:36.540
So I have this rig set up that has my phone on it.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.500
And right now I'm running through camo, which again, all the reviews of using an iPhone

03:41.500 --> 03:47.340
versus a Logitech Brio, this blows the Brio out of the water.

03:47.340 --> 03:49.600
So I've got my apps all set up.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.380
You don't need an IP for the record.

03:53.380 --> 04:00.740
There's an OBS, iPhone for OBS app that does it natively for OBS.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.140
So you don't need to have an IP or an address or anything like that.

04:04.140 --> 04:10.940
You just straight up hook up, install the link plugin and you're set.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.220
The same with camo.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.700
It works the same way.

04:13.700 --> 04:21.140
I am incredibly happy with it and well, I can charge my phone and do stuff at the same

04:21.140 --> 04:22.140
time.

04:22.140 --> 04:27.100
So yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.300
Depending on how this goes, I may actually pay for this one.

04:31.300 --> 04:35.980
You know, I'm going to have to re-listen to this and take notes seriously or try to

04:35.980 --> 04:39.460
get some links from you for some of this, because this is really good for the whole

04:39.460 --> 04:45.260
discussion about, you know, anybody can have a Twitch channel or anybody can have a YouTube.

04:45.260 --> 04:47.060
Anybody can do a podcast.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.660
You know, we want to get more voices out there.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.400
We want to get, you know, a lot of diversity and a lot of different people out there.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.580
And a lot of folks think they have to buy this big, fancy technical equipment to get

04:55.580 --> 04:56.640
started.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.900
And it turns out, you can probably just use your phone.

04:58.900 --> 05:03.460
I mean, you might have to pay a small fee for, you know, the converter thing or whatever,

05:03.460 --> 05:04.660
but that's pretty awesome.

05:04.660 --> 05:09.140
Well, and the thing is just to point out something that Tiger Claw is saying is to use like an

05:09.140 --> 05:10.140
IP one.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.140
No, don't use an IP.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.140
Anything that uses an IP.

05:13.140 --> 05:16.300
Use something that's going to use plugins and your USB cable.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.020
You will get far less latency that way.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.540
Oh, good to know.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.540
All right.

05:20.540 --> 05:21.540
Yeah.

05:21.540 --> 05:22.540
And usually a higher image quality.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.040
Before I go to Loki, how did you, did you have a good week off?

05:26.040 --> 05:30.040
I think you were here streaming that night, right?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
I don't remember.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.000
The 4th of July we had off here at O.L.R. because the holiday in the States at my normal

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
time.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Gotcha.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
OK.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
We went swimming.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
OK.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Nice.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Nice.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I spent I spent the day up in the.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.320
So for those of you that remember an old, old show, I used to host here on Vaga called

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Horde House.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.440
It was about like Warcraft and other online games.

05:51.440 --> 05:56.000
So or if you ever heard Starboard Power Coupling, that was Captain Matt or Grandpa Matt, depending

05:56.000 --> 05:57.880
what show it was, his show.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.040
And he has a cabin out in the woods literally now.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.440
So he has a cabin out in the woods.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.880
And so he invited us up for the fourth.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.440
And it was great because you know what?

06:04.440 --> 06:09.320
No fireworks because they are all banned up there because that is primo.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.360
You know, unfortunately, forest fire territory.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.360
So fireworks are huge.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
No, no.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.360
It was so quiet and so peaceful.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.520
I had a great fourth.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.520
Lovely.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.560
Anyway, high tech master Loki, how are you?

06:21.560 --> 06:25.020
You could get around that band by just saying that you're doing a gender reveal and then

06:25.060 --> 06:27.060
it's OK.

06:27.060 --> 06:30.220
No, that's even worse.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.740
Those stupid parties have even more disaster than anything else.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.580
It's just, oh, my gosh, ridiculous anyway.

06:37.580 --> 06:38.580
How was your holiday?

06:38.580 --> 06:39.580
How was your break?

06:39.580 --> 06:40.580
It was fine.

06:40.580 --> 06:46.820
We just went over to my mom's house because my niece is born on the Fourth of July.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.140
So it was her birthday as well.

06:49.140 --> 06:54.540
So we went over there, just did pizza and lit up some fireworks.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.060
Nice.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.020
Sounds like you had a nice, nice little break.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.020
How's that?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.060
How's the YouTube channel going?

07:01.060 --> 07:03.460
You posted another video in the past few days, right?

07:03.460 --> 07:04.460
I'm not.

07:04.460 --> 07:08.220
Well, I posted one last week, I think.

07:08.220 --> 07:13.500
It's been a struggle because we've been having weird server issue things.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.100
Also, the build I'm doing right now is very big.

07:17.100 --> 07:22.660
And so it's taken a long time to get to the point where I can do a time lapse and actually

07:22.660 --> 07:23.660
build it.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.780
I'm finished with the design stuff right now because I'm finishing what I started with

07:26.780 --> 07:30.780
Tango, kind of the build inspired by that.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.640
It's enormous.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.840
So I've been just kind of working to get there and we just updated the 117.1.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.680
So with that came other things that are breaking.

07:40.680 --> 07:46.460
So I got stuff to work, though, finally, but it's just been a little bit of a struggle.

07:46.460 --> 07:47.460
All right.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.060
Yeah, I did release a video, I think, last week.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.760
I wanted to release one this week.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.920
I will try to get it out as early as I can.

07:55.920 --> 08:03.040
We've had people leave the server as well, and they've gone to other SMP servers, which

08:03.040 --> 08:05.200
looked pretty fun.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.520
But I'm sticking with this one until the end of the season.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.440
So we'll see what happens.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.440
All right.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.440
Sounds good.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.360
So we're going to get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.040
But first, I thought I'd kind of reintroduce the show since we were off last week.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.640
It's been a little while since I've done a little reintroduction.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.640
And we got that nice little raid here at the top of the show tonight between Bobby's

08:23.640 --> 08:25.480
show going off air and us coming on air.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.480
So hi.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.480
Hi.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
That's our intro.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
Hi.

08:29.480 --> 08:33.920
We're Orange Lawns Radio, and we have just entered our 20th year of internet broadcasting,

08:33.920 --> 08:34.920
if you can believe it.

08:34.920 --> 08:39.000
We celebrated our 19th birthday, that was our last live episode two weeks ago.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.720
So we've been doing this show for a long time.

08:40.720 --> 08:46.640
We all met as frenzies playing Dance Dance Revolution and other music games at the arcade.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.720
That's how we met.

08:48.720 --> 08:49.720
Which is great.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.520
So to kind of talk a little bit about Summer Games Done Quick a little bit, which our pal

08:53.520 --> 08:58.480
Bobby was involved with, they had a really cute run of some music games that they did.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.080
And they were doing Dance Rush Stardom, which is what they do online.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.160
That's the new one they do, which has no...

09:05.160 --> 09:08.800
It's funny because that's what we used to talk about back in the day was, imagine if

09:08.800 --> 09:11.420
it was just one giant pad and it could reach...

09:11.420 --> 09:14.800
That's literally what Dance Rush Stardom is, but it was really cute because they got the

09:14.800 --> 09:16.320
whole community involved at the end.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.240
And I was like, oh, that is something we would have done back in the day.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.240
It's adorable.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.840
So anyway, that's the whole...

09:21.840 --> 09:24.800
Those music games have been around forever and that's where we were all kind of born

09:24.800 --> 09:25.820
out of.

09:25.820 --> 09:30.720
We did a show on Live 365 for a long time and then time passes and for us, there was

09:30.720 --> 09:36.800
a long break in music games between the last DDR they really did and then the rock band.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.320
So kind of in that interim, we decided we're going to talk about all video games and make

09:40.320 --> 09:42.220
our show about all types of games.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.880
And that's where we've been at ever since.

09:43.880 --> 09:44.920
It's been a very long time.

09:44.920 --> 09:50.280
So we were live on Shoutcast for a long time and we made the switch to Twitch about two

09:50.280 --> 09:52.360
years ago and it's been working great.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.880
We get to meet a lot more people, you get to see our faces for better or for worse.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.880
But remember, we are recording a podcast.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.920
So sometimes our video interactions are a little bit minimal because we have had this

10:03.920 --> 10:10.400
podcast pretty much before iTunes launched podcasting, so a very, very long time.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.720
So we mainly do this for the folks listening on the podcast feed.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.000
But of course, we love the folks that join us live on Sunday nights as well.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You know what, Rob?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Yes.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.360
I'll just say real quick, Orange Wright shared that clip from episode one where we predicted

10:25.360 --> 10:26.360
Dance Rush.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
Sorry.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.360
Yes.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
Yes, Jamie.

10:29.360 --> 10:34.640
So I was thinking that when I submitted us for a Guinness World Record, I said longest

10:34.640 --> 10:36.840
running internet video game show.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
Yeah.

10:37.840 --> 10:43.240
I should have actually said longest running video game show.

10:43.240 --> 10:48.280
Because yeah, I don't know what on TV or traditional radio would be longer.

10:48.280 --> 10:52.000
Well, I mean, really just any sort of video game program.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I can't think of...

10:54.000 --> 10:55.400
You know, non-print.

10:55.400 --> 11:01.240
We've outlasted and gone longer than just about anything that's been on TV.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.000
Oh, Bobby says Electric Playground still exists.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.060
They started in the 90s in Canada and they're still on today.

11:07.100 --> 11:12.820
No big break because I wouldn't count X-Play because there's going to be a big break there

11:12.820 --> 11:15.060
between all that.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.060
But if that's...

11:16.060 --> 11:17.060
Then it is what it is.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.060
When are they coming back?

11:18.060 --> 11:21.580
They keep talking about G-Force coming back, G-Force coming back.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.580
When?

11:22.580 --> 11:24.060
When is that happening?

11:24.060 --> 11:29.140
Because I hear all the hype about it's coming back, but I don't see it coming back.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.780
To be clear, I know they are different shows, I'm aware.

11:31.780 --> 11:34.540
But I'm just saying, I was using X-Play as an example.

11:34.540 --> 11:37.460
They are at a big break and so that wouldn't count.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.460
So anyway.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.740
Yeah, because they did like a thing back in Thanksgiving.

11:41.740 --> 11:45.780
That was like eight months ago.

11:45.780 --> 11:49.300
Where is G-Force?

11:49.300 --> 11:50.300
It's still...

11:50.300 --> 11:53.020
Well, back to the Guinness World Record.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.340
Yes, please.

11:56.340 --> 12:02.120
I'm glad that I submitted it in the category that I did because it is a first.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.320
And I'm feeling very confident that we're going to get it.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.320
That's exciting.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.320
Very, very confident.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
That's exciting.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.200
So I don't think we're going to get it because everything goes...

12:10.200 --> 12:12.760
Everything is unfortunately bad for me.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.920
So I'm going to expect we don't get it.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.400
I'm just bringing the whole show down.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.720
Who says I'm doing it for you?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.200
I'm doing it for me.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
It's just by association.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.800
Have you ever seen the movie The Cooler?

12:22.800 --> 12:27.760
Yeah, I'm the cooler, but just in the sense of like reality and yeah.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.760
And I'm an apothesis.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.940
So my thought is, eh.

12:30.940 --> 12:31.940
Don't you dare.

12:31.940 --> 12:32.940
I don't need this.

12:32.940 --> 12:33.940
No, it'll be awesome.

12:33.940 --> 12:34.940
It'll be awesome.

12:34.940 --> 12:35.940
All right.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.940
Yeah.

12:36.940 --> 12:40.540
Let's get into it before we get accused of not ever talking about video games.

12:40.540 --> 12:46.260
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and talk about a big story that's going around

12:46.260 --> 12:47.940
the gaming world this week.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.180
And that is Nintendo unveiled a new Switch.

12:51.180 --> 12:52.180
Switch Pro!

12:52.180 --> 12:53.180
Wait.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.180
Yawn.

12:54.180 --> 12:55.180
Yawn.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.180
Gotcha.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.180
Okay, so...

12:57.180 --> 12:58.180
Major yawn.

12:58.180 --> 13:07.020
The thing is that I don't want to say I told you so, but we set our expectations, not we,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.020
but you.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.460
I'm saying we to be nice.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.820
Set your expectations a little high.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.500
By we, we mean you.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.100
Yeah, by we, we mean you.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.180
I had no expectations, so they've met none of that.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.300
This is a relationship.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.660
When I say it's not you, it's me.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.580
It's actually you.

13:23.580 --> 13:28.540
The problem is y'all set your expectations too high on social media for that Switch Pro

13:28.540 --> 13:33.860
because Bloomberg and all these other clickbait sites that exist to generate revenue based

13:33.860 --> 13:34.860
off clicks.

13:34.860 --> 13:35.860
I don't want to say they lied.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.900
I actually don't think they lied.

13:37.900 --> 13:44.900
But they hyped up some rumors and whispers and things written on bathroom stalls that

13:44.900 --> 13:50.300
perhaps were not ready for prime time just yet.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.740
So we found out we are getting a new Switch.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.140
So let's talk about what we are getting.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.700
It's an OLED model.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.900
So in a nutshell, it's going to be a different handheld unit.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.900
It will be a seven inch handheld with the OLED screen.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.660
That's going to be the biggest change.

14:03.660 --> 14:06.260
So basically it's going to look more like a PlayStation Vita because I think the Vita

14:06.260 --> 14:07.860
used OLED, if I'm not mistaken.

14:07.860 --> 14:08.860
Right.

14:08.860 --> 14:09.860
That's a gorgeous screen.

14:09.860 --> 14:12.300
Like that's that's the reason to still play again.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.720
Final Fantasy four.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.380
My favorite to play it on is the Vita, the PSP version on the Vita.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.060
That is my favorite way to play that game.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.300
And these new little remakes they're doing.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.660
I know we're not going to be as good.

14:22.660 --> 14:27.340
So anyway, there's also going to be a wired LAN port in the dock, if that's a thing that's

14:27.340 --> 14:28.340
of interest to you.

14:28.340 --> 14:32.940
And oh, a boost in internal storage to 64 gigabytes.

14:32.940 --> 14:37.500
That we're getting there.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.740
That will all be coming out the same day as Metroid Dread.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.780
That's October the 8th.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.880
And it's going to set you back three hundred and fifty dollars for the system.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.100
Now look, if I were to play most of my time in handheld, I'd probably think this is pretty

14:50.100 --> 14:51.100
cool.

14:51.100 --> 14:57.080
I might consider getting one, although since I already have a Switch, I'm not sure I'm

14:57.080 --> 14:59.380
really into it.

14:59.380 --> 15:03.000
But this is going to be great for people who, for whatever reason, still haven't got on

15:03.000 --> 15:05.020
board with the Switch yet.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.140
This is going to be a sweet upgrade for those folks, I think.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.980
But you know, for folks like me who play 95 percent of the time in docked mode, there's

15:11.980 --> 15:13.180
really nothing here.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.580
I mean, one could argue maybe the wired LAN.

15:15.580 --> 15:20.980
You can you can you can get that like as an accessory or whatever.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.940
You can find it separately, too.

15:22.940 --> 15:23.940
Yeah, exactly.

15:23.940 --> 15:31.600
So the biggest surprise in that is that it's not a 4K system and it's not a pro.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.180
It's not a buffed up system.

15:33.180 --> 15:39.860
It's not going to get you more frames on Breath of the Wild or Breath of the Wild 2.

15:39.860 --> 15:43.800
I kind of think, you know, and I said this before a few shows ago, I kind of think what

15:43.800 --> 15:49.820
happened here is that I said this when Nintendo didn't announce anything leading up to E3

15:49.820 --> 15:53.340
and then they came out and said their E3 presentation was specifically they specifically

15:53.340 --> 15:58.680
said software only, no hardware, and then they kind of lied because they had that Zelda

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Game and Watch.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.220
But we'll let that one slide.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.420
They very clearly made it known there's not going to be any Switch announcements.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.260
And that was the point where I think I was saying and to be fair, other people, too,

16:07.260 --> 16:09.580
were saying, you know what?

16:09.580 --> 16:13.780
This chip shortage that's going on in the world right now, you you still can't get a

16:13.780 --> 16:15.900
fucking PlayStation five.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.420
Does Nintendo really want to get?

16:17.980 --> 16:24.880
Do you want Nintendo and their hardware folks, which, oh, that can be exhausting sometimes

16:24.880 --> 16:26.700
to try to find Nintendo hardware, right?

16:26.700 --> 16:29.540
Do you want Nintendo to try to release a Switch Pro right now?

16:29.540 --> 16:34.540
Because to be honest, with the chip shortages still going around and stuff, I kind of don't.

16:34.540 --> 16:39.380
I kind of think this is great news that we're not getting a Switch Pro this year because

16:39.380 --> 16:41.280
I don't want to fight people for one.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.800
And I think deep down, most of you don't want to fight people for one either, as much as

16:44.800 --> 16:47.600
you may have liked the four K and all that stuff.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
You know what?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.640
Let it bake in the oven for another year.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.400
Maybe we'll see something next year instead.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.280
Maybe at this point, they just say, screw it.

16:56.280 --> 17:02.960
And we get a Switch two or a, you know, a real successor to the Switch console.

17:02.960 --> 17:07.320
I oh, my, the Switch, you were getting in the switch.

17:07.320 --> 17:12.840
I kind of think I kind of, you know, not to get too far off topic with that, but I kind

17:12.880 --> 17:16.080
of think Nintendo is going to stick with the Switch for a while.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.800
I think everybody's talking about what would they'll go from the Switch Pro to the next

17:19.800 --> 17:20.800
Nintendo console.

17:20.800 --> 17:26.460
And I'm kind of like the next Nintendo console will be a switch of some sort.

17:26.460 --> 17:27.460
It would.

17:27.460 --> 17:30.060
They're going to keep this handheld dock thing going for a while.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.060
It might look different.

17:31.060 --> 17:36.540
It might have some radical changes, but the whole concept of switch and that that is staying.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.400
I would be shocked if they went away from that.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.800
But then again, they kind of did that with Wii U, didn't they?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.880
They walked away from those motion controllers and look where that got them.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.960
So I don't know.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.420
Pod Culture in chat says the Super Switch.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.840
I think that would be a great name for it.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.640
I hope they name the successor better, whatever they do.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.060
I think Super Switch is the way to go.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.120
It's very clear, very plain.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.800
And you know what you're going to get with something like that.

18:01.800 --> 18:07.480
But anyway, I digress because that is going to be at least a year down the line at this

18:07.480 --> 18:08.480
point.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.300
The Super Switch is all we got this year and Nintendo is not going to do something new

18:11.300 --> 18:13.040
for this holiday.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.440
Let's get to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.600
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Shane wants to fight people for one.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.960
Now, I'm not going to try to speak for Shane, but I do talk to him a lot.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.840
I don't think he's as like I think he kind of got to the point where he's like, all right,

18:26.840 --> 18:28.080
I'll get one.

18:28.080 --> 18:32.480
But it wasn't something where he was like, oh, like when it was first revealed, he was

18:32.480 --> 18:35.920
like, oh, I got to go get in line right now or I don't.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.120
And Shane, if you're out there, feel free to text or chat.

18:39.120 --> 18:43.360
But that was the impression I got anyway.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
Let's see.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.840
OK, I thought that was I thought that was Shane texting me and that was actually Dark

18:48.840 --> 18:50.840
Sakura saying why she went afk.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.120
I was like, wow, that was quick.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.120
Other comments in chat.

18:55.120 --> 19:00.400
S2100 Matt says, to be fair, Nintendo has done well with their IPs, indie titles and

19:00.400 --> 19:03.920
so forth that they don't need a Switch Pro this year or even next.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.800
See, I'm kind of with you there.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.560
Animal Crossing was bananas, and I think they're going to have another great holiday for the

19:10.560 --> 19:12.560
system they've got.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.900
S2100 Matt continues, a year ago, we were talking about how Animal Crossing was the

19:15.900 --> 19:18.000
highest sold game of the pandemic.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.880
That game wasn't in 4K, 120 FPS, BBQ.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.400
Nintendo can strike gold again on this current hardware.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.640
Yeah, I agree.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.560
I think it would be even better if I could play Breath of the Wild in 4K.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.440
But again, I don't want to fight people for that right now.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.000
I still can't get a PlayStation 5 easily.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.880
I mean, if I really wanted to work at it and really wanted to camp on websites, like, I guess I

19:42.880 --> 19:44.440
could go and get a PlayStation 5.

19:44.440 --> 19:51.720
But like, I don't know any other industry, maybe concert tickets where I have to beg to buy one.

19:51.720 --> 19:56.200
Like, I will get a PlayStation 5 when I can walk into Target and pick one up off the shelf.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.320
Although that's that's that's kind of what I did with Xbox Series X.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.040
So, you know, that's why I have one of those.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.400
So there is that.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.960
Yeah, I'm getting so much use out of my Series X too.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.360
So, yeah, I got to be honest.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.840
I'm I'm loving the Series X right now for meeting the needs of this current generation.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.800
That's not don't don't label Rob Roberts, Xbox fanboy.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.640
No, I love all.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.680
I want to see everybody succeed.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.280
I'm like mean girls when she's splitting up the crown and want to give everybody a piece.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.640
OK, that's me with the gaming industry.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.760
I want to see everybody succeed.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.160
But just as it is right now, the PlayStation 5 is kind of a pain to get.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.440
And I don't feel like there's anything.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.800
I kind of I really did want to play Returnal.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.680
I was at the first game where I was like, oh, I really need.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.600
And I think once some more of these games start coming out, like Final Fantasy 16, that's

20:40.600 --> 20:43.080
going to come out eventually, but not this year.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.760
But if it's out next holiday, oh, I'm fucking buying a PlayStation 5 because you better

20:46.760 --> 20:51.320
believe you better believe I'm playing Final Fantasy 16 when it's by the folks who did

20:51.320 --> 20:58.120
14, which I think is probably the best Final Fantasy game they've made at this point.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.600
It's just incredible.

20:59.600 --> 21:06.040
So let's see, Pod Culture in chat says, if I could find someone willing to pay full boat

21:06.040 --> 21:10.280
for my Mario Switch, I'd consider upgrading since I mainly play in handheld.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.640
But otherwise, nope.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.440
You might be surprised, Pod Culture.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.160
People want to still buy those old hardware things.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.360
I don't know if you've used it.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.440
It might be a little harder.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.600
You might not get the full value from it, but you never know.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.280
Take a look.

21:25.280 --> 21:30.880
And let's say SSG100Matt says, you have better odds winning two of those PlayStation 5s on

21:30.880 --> 21:33.240
Summer Game Stunt Quick's giveaway.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.440
They even joke on stream most of the staff of GDQ can't get a PS5.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.760
Well, I entered because I donated at the end of the Summer Game Stunt Quick there yesterday.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.440
So who knows?

21:44.440 --> 21:49.040
Maybe I will be lucky enough to win one, but I'm not going to count on it.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.740
Questbuster says you can also sign up using your PlayStation account on Sony site and

21:52.740 --> 21:56.780
for a chance and an invite reserving your spot for you in a virtual queue.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.620
I did that like a year and a half ago.

21:59.620 --> 22:00.620
Still.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.820
Yeah, I remember that back in September.

22:02.820 --> 22:05.940
Never got an email, so.

22:05.940 --> 22:06.940
But it's honest.

22:06.940 --> 22:11.740
Honestly, if they sent me an invite, I would just say, I don't want one right now.

22:11.740 --> 22:12.740
I don't know.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.740
I'm saving money.

22:13.740 --> 22:17.220
I can't plunk 500 on a console right now, but maybe give it to me.

22:17.220 --> 22:22.500
I don't give me $500 and sure, I'll give you a PS5.

22:22.780 --> 22:24.580
I would be down for that.

22:24.580 --> 22:28.140
You're going to give me $500 and I'll get you a PS5?

22:28.140 --> 22:30.620
Yeah, with the $500 I give you.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.620
OK.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.620
Oh, yeah.

22:32.620 --> 22:33.620
If I get my cordial invite.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.620
OK.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.620
All right.

22:35.620 --> 22:36.620
Yes.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.620
We'll talk offline.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.620
We'll talk.

22:38.620 --> 22:39.620
All right.

22:39.620 --> 22:40.620
Questbuster says I got an invite, but they ran out.

22:40.620 --> 22:41.620
So.

22:41.620 --> 22:42.620
Oh, my God.

22:42.620 --> 22:46.420
Can you imagine getting invited to like Disneyland to ride a new ride or something and then you

22:46.420 --> 22:49.180
get all the way down there and they're like, it broke.

22:49.180 --> 22:53.100
So is this like the reservation for the car from Seinfeld?

22:53.100 --> 22:58.780
You know, it's like I don't think you understand what a reservation means.

22:58.780 --> 23:01.500
Or it's oh, oh, oh, what's the other terrible one?

23:01.500 --> 23:02.580
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:02.580 --> 23:03.740
I've never watched that show.

23:03.740 --> 23:05.500
No, I can relate, though.

23:05.500 --> 23:10.420
You book a seat on a flight and you don't actually have a seat on the flight.

23:10.420 --> 23:15.320
And then they're like, sorry, we're bumping you because we oversold the flight.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.820
It's that.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.260
Gross.

23:18.260 --> 23:25.300
Anyway, that's when I turn into Major Karen and raise some hell.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.220
At least we have a kitty on stream now.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.220
It's nice to see.

23:28.220 --> 23:29.220
Anyway.

23:29.220 --> 23:31.020
It was staring me down.

23:31.020 --> 23:35.580
Any anyone here on the hosting panel considering a Nintendo OLED switch?

23:35.580 --> 23:36.580
No.

23:36.580 --> 23:37.580
OK.

23:37.580 --> 23:38.580
No.

23:38.580 --> 23:42.140
Unless the kids break mine, which is a distinct possibility.

23:42.140 --> 23:43.260
Don't encourage them, Loki.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.940
If they overhear that, they don't have to encourage them.

23:45.940 --> 23:49.260
Thankfully they've been playing mostly Roblox stuff.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.900
So they haven't really been playing the switch.

23:50.900 --> 23:56.900
But I'm sure we'll get the new Zelda game and the remastered Zelda game.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.700
So yeah.

23:58.700 --> 23:59.700
Hold up.

23:59.700 --> 24:03.960
Mike Defton chat says PlayStation fives here cost fifteen thousand Mexican pesos.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.340
That's about seven hundred and fifty dollars USD.

24:06.340 --> 24:08.300
But at least you can find them more easily.

24:08.300 --> 24:13.260
So you mean I can walk into I don't know what the big electronic stores are in Mexico.

24:13.260 --> 24:16.540
I'll assume we live in a world where fries still exist in Mexico.

24:16.540 --> 24:21.520
So I can still walk into fries Mexico and pick up a PlayStation five off the shelf.

24:21.520 --> 24:26.660
I just have to pay like, you know, 250 extra dollars for it, which totally goes against

24:26.660 --> 24:28.900
everything I believe in when it comes to scalpers anyway.

24:28.900 --> 24:32.180
But at least at least in that scenario where they're kind of importing things, it makes

24:32.180 --> 24:33.540
a little more sense.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.060
Mike Defton says maybe.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.060
Wow.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.060
Wow.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.060
All right.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.060
Interesting.

24:39.060 --> 24:43.660
Well, Tiger cloud does remind us the switch OLED is not going to make the games play better.

24:43.660 --> 24:47.220
Sure it has a better screen, but it's not going to improve the quality of the games,

24:47.220 --> 24:49.120
but they'll look better.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.540
That's what's not on your TV, though, won't affect us.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.540
Look at that.

24:53.540 --> 24:54.540
That's true.

24:54.540 --> 24:55.540
Not on your TV.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.100
And the Tiger also brings up the joy cons.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.300
They're the same as the original switch.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.740
So they didn't fix the drift problem.

25:00.740 --> 25:01.740
Oh, yes.

25:01.740 --> 25:03.820
I heard somebody would have learned by now.

25:03.820 --> 25:08.740
I heard somebody asked Nintendo directly about that and got like a no comment in response,

25:08.740 --> 25:10.260
which means, yes, it's the same.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.260
And they haven't.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.540
How how have they not fixed the same?

25:13.540 --> 25:14.540
That's setting themselves.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.460
Oh, oh, that's a choice.

25:16.460 --> 25:17.460
That is a choice.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.460
Nintendo.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.460
That is a choice.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
All right.

25:20.460 --> 25:26.340
Speaking of choices, I made a very good choice by having Alan go to Costco before the show

25:26.340 --> 25:29.740
because he put down in front of me earlier a churro from Costco.

25:29.740 --> 25:36.180
So I have a Costco churro that I'm going to chow down on while Dark Soccer tells us about

25:36.180 --> 25:37.180
her gaming week.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.180
So how was your get?

25:38.180 --> 25:41.140
What are the choices you made with your gaming week this week, Dark Soccer?

25:41.140 --> 25:44.680
Still no Animal Crossing.

25:44.680 --> 25:51.700
Basically it's been Dead by Daylight and Fantasian, but when I was streaming Fantasian, my Internet

25:51.700 --> 25:53.340
cut out was sad.

25:53.340 --> 25:57.860
I'm really in that grindy part where I need to buff up a couple of my characters so I

25:57.860 --> 26:03.740
may not play it on stream anymore for a little bit until I finish the buffing.

26:03.740 --> 26:08.340
So it's really been mostly Dead by Daylight.

26:08.340 --> 26:17.780
I've been participating in the event and bringing out my cake and I have not yet gotten a five

26:17.780 --> 26:19.640
cake match.

26:19.640 --> 26:27.020
I got a four cake match and some jackass brought escape cake, which doesn't help me at all.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.780
How very dare they?

26:28.780 --> 26:35.420
I'm playing my worst games and of course we have pinball going on, so that's it.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.420
All right.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.500
Have you gotten some killer crowns?

26:38.500 --> 26:46.180
Oh, I got all the killer crowns, which I mean, for the characters that you can get them.

26:46.180 --> 26:50.760
I did pick up a couple of survivor perks just in case it happens.

26:50.760 --> 26:56.260
So I got like live and dead hard because everyone either uses live or dead hard.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.260
So I figured, huh?

26:58.740 --> 27:09.780
Um, but other than that, um, I, I've just been, I got my crown on twins and it's enough

27:09.780 --> 27:13.020
to know that I hate playing twins.

27:13.020 --> 27:18.980
I hate playing Blort, who will always be called Blort to me.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.100
Oh, he is hard.

27:20.100 --> 27:22.660
He's harder than nurse in many ways.

27:22.660 --> 27:23.660
Yeah.

27:23.660 --> 27:24.660
Yeah.

27:25.060 --> 27:29.820
As a nurse, it's just a matter of getting, uh, getting used to how the blinks work, which

27:29.820 --> 27:30.820
I do have to show.

27:30.820 --> 27:37.420
I don't remember their names, but these, uh, I, I think that they realized that I was legit

27:37.420 --> 27:41.900
a baby nurse and it was right before end game collapse.

27:41.900 --> 27:47.420
A couple of, uh, a couple of, uh, survivors actually just, I could tell that's what they

27:47.420 --> 27:48.420
were doing.

27:48.420 --> 27:52.340
They were letting me practice my blinks.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.880
And I thought that was really nice.

27:54.100 --> 27:58.640
You know, usually I get nothing but, you know, sweaty, toxic survivors who like to do the

27:58.640 --> 28:01.520
butt dance and, you know, act like children.

28:01.520 --> 28:08.640
Um, which to me I think is unnecessary and probably a skilled player shouldn't do that

28:08.640 --> 28:09.960
if they're mature.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.640
Um, but at any rate, um, they were really nice.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.760
They just let me run around.

28:16.760 --> 28:20.480
They seem to know I got a couple of hits in, it was pretty cool.

28:20.520 --> 28:26.360
I would just let one run off and go after the other and let, you know, we just run around

28:26.360 --> 28:29.400
all of the Yamaoka estate and it was pretty cool.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
Yeah.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.920
Um, I had some interesting matches.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.880
I was playing as killer as well.

28:33.880 --> 28:39.480
And um, you know, some were like, I played a few pyramid head matches and in one match,

28:39.480 --> 28:40.480
like they did not want it.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.600
Like it was a five cake match.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.000
They did not want to farm.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.120
I was like, I was out in the middle drawing circles.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.000
I'm like, come here and let's farm.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.700
They didn't want to do it.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.860
And so, but then I got another one where some idiot DC'd right.

28:52.860 --> 28:56.780
Well, maybe it wasn't their fault, but they DC'd right when the match started and I ended

28:56.780 --> 28:59.260
up unintentionally slugging the other three.

28:59.260 --> 29:04.220
I didn't mean to, but I actually, I picked one up and let them get out so they could

29:04.220 --> 29:05.220
go pick somebody up.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.860
And I was like, all right, we're going to farm.

29:06.860 --> 29:07.860
Then here's the punchline.

29:07.860 --> 29:10.980
So they finally get the door open and then I get booted from the game.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.120
I think my game freezes and I get DC'd.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.300
So you know how many blood points I got?

29:14.300 --> 29:15.300
Zero.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
I'm so mad.

29:16.300 --> 29:20.140
I'm going to play the DVD for the rest of the day because behavior has made a great

29:20.140 --> 29:23.700
game that runs like garbage.

29:23.700 --> 29:29.940
You know, I did, I did actually have an interesting match and it was actually one of the, it was,

29:29.940 --> 29:34.580
I think my third time playing Freddy and I actually had a really good one.

29:34.580 --> 29:42.660
I had, uh, one DC, two kills and I was about to get a Meg and I closed the hatch by accident.

29:42.660 --> 29:44.780
I was going to let her go.

29:44.780 --> 29:49.180
And so she's slugged, no one to heal her.

29:49.180 --> 29:54.180
And I can't open the gate once the apparently once the hatches closed, you can't open the

29:54.180 --> 29:55.180
gate.

29:55.180 --> 29:56.180
Right.

29:56.180 --> 30:02.580
So what I did is I picked her up and ran around until she got down and then we went and hung

30:02.580 --> 30:06.900
back over by the gate so I could let her out or she could let herself out.

30:06.900 --> 30:12.660
But you know, it was, it was, that also had like one of the most annoying Dwight's ever.

30:13.060 --> 30:14.060
It was great.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.060
Hanging that guy.

30:15.060 --> 30:16.060
All right, I'm done.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.060
All right.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.060
Enough dead by daylight.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.060
Let's go to somebody who doesn't play that game.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.060
Let's go to Loki.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.060
Loki, how was your game?

30:21.060 --> 30:22.060
I don't play that game.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.060
You don't play that game.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.060
What do you play?

30:24.060 --> 30:25.060
It's just Minecraft.

30:25.060 --> 30:29.500
And so that's what I've been doing, just still playing on the server.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.760
Mainly this week was just finishing up the design of the build that I'm going to be working

30:32.760 --> 30:34.780
on here pretty soon.

30:34.780 --> 30:38.140
I think also gathering resources for that as well.

30:38.140 --> 30:46.020
So there was actually a lot of mining being done and harassing the server admins about

30:46.020 --> 30:50.100
our spawn rates because we were, we've had an issue and I brought it up in my last video

30:50.100 --> 30:57.860
where no mobs were spawning, which kind of makes it hard to run a mob farm that requires

30:57.860 --> 30:59.380
those mobs to be spawning.

30:59.380 --> 31:03.000
And so it's been like fixed and broken all throughout the week.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.660
So I think it's now finally actually working again.

31:05.660 --> 31:14.020
But that kind of put a lot of my plans I had to make other mob farms on hold for a while.

31:14.020 --> 31:19.020
Also with my new shop they have, which sells axolotls, they have the rare blue one, which

31:19.020 --> 31:23.860
prior to 117.1, you could actually just find those in the wild.

31:23.860 --> 31:30.020
And so I was actually planning on building a upgraded farm to farm those because otherwise

31:30.020 --> 31:36.700
you have to breed them and it's like a one in 1200 chance of getting one and it's a real

31:36.700 --> 31:38.420
pain in the ass to do that.

31:38.420 --> 31:42.860
So unfortunately, now that we've updated the 117.1, that is my only option.

31:42.860 --> 31:47.300
So I'm going to raise the price on those.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.340
But yeah, it's mainly been just Minecraft.

31:49.340 --> 31:55.540
So now I'm finally getting to the point where I'm going to start that build for my new video.

31:55.540 --> 31:56.880
Had to terraform a bunch of stuff.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.860
So that's taken a long time because it's a massive build.

31:59.900 --> 32:07.020
It's like 40 blocks by 42 and I think 70 tall, just this massive factory.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.860
So I'm going to be doing that.

32:08.860 --> 32:15.260
And then I don't know from there, I've been trying to get more people involved with like

32:15.260 --> 32:21.540
doing streaming or like content creation, but it's like it's not happening, which is

32:21.540 --> 32:27.560
very disappointing, especially not to complain, but I'm going to.

32:27.560 --> 32:33.600
We had somebody leave our server and apparently they're an admin or they run their own other

32:33.600 --> 32:39.640
another SMP and the guy started off his brand new YouTube channel and it's already getting

32:39.640 --> 32:47.160
like 1000 views per video, just a brand new thing, which is frustrating when you have

32:47.160 --> 32:53.440
a hermit from hermitcraft in your episode and you can't pull more than 200 views.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.640
A little frustrating.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.200
So I will keep at it, stick at it.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.160
You just, you never know the one that's going to catch fire.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.420
You just have to stick with it.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.560
That's all it is.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.760
It's hard because I gotta put the cat down.

33:05.760 --> 33:06.760
It's hard.

33:06.760 --> 33:07.760
Put the cat in the video.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.600
I bet you'll get a lot of hits for that.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Oh, gosh.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Stella plays Minecraft.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.400
She's shedding like crazy.

33:14.400 --> 33:20.400
So it's hard because like a server like that, where you have a lot of people on that server

33:20.400 --> 33:24.280
actually doing content creation, they share their view, their audience.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.800
And so each person may bring in like a hundred people or so, and then you're sharing audiences

33:28.800 --> 33:31.000
and that's how you grow grandically.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.600
That was the hope when I joined the server that, Oh, Hey, there's multiple people making

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
content.

33:35.600 --> 33:39.240
And when I came on, that was the case, there was a few people had a couple episodes.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.000
Now there's nobody, it's just like, it's just me.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.720
And so the only con the only audience I can grow is the people that are on the server

33:46.720 --> 33:48.440
watching themselves.

33:48.440 --> 33:54.640
And then maybe anybody else I can try to like get in with advertising on a bunch, like on

33:54.640 --> 33:58.140
different discords, like I'm on a bunch of the hermit's discord.

33:58.140 --> 33:59.740
So they have like media sharing things.

33:59.740 --> 34:04.000
So I posted in there, I posted forums, I posted on Twitter, social media, like everywhere.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.120
And it's just nothing like, it's just nothing, but I'm going to keep at it.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.820
It's just, it's frustrating.

34:09.820 --> 34:10.820
Change your server.

34:10.820 --> 34:14.920
If it, if it isn't, if everybody abandoned ship, then yeah, but I can't, I don't want

34:14.920 --> 34:19.760
to right now, but just because they like the other server, it would have like had that

34:19.760 --> 34:24.720
sort of been in existence at the time, I probably would have joined something like that, but

34:24.720 --> 34:29.240
there's like so many, it's hard to say like how it would have even gone, but we'll see.

34:29.240 --> 34:34.760
I just am a little frustrated seeing like, cause not to like dog on like people and in

34:34.760 --> 34:39.760
the quality of their content, but like his video was bad.

34:39.760 --> 34:44.760
His audio was terrible and yeah, he's pulling in 900 reviews on this first feels like that's

34:44.800 --> 34:45.800
frustrating.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.840
Like that is absolutely frustrating.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
Aren't you?

34:48.840 --> 34:51.040
Aren't you used to it by now from this podcast?

34:51.040 --> 34:57.080
Like I'm not, I'm not saying high quality podcast or anything, but I heard some of the

34:57.080 --> 34:58.080
ones that have caught fire though.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.720
I will never forget the one I listened to and this is a very popular show and no, I'm

35:01.720 --> 35:06.280
not going to name it because I am not that kind of person, but I listened to it and I'm

35:06.280 --> 35:10.280
like, this guy sounds like he's being held prisoner and doesn't want to be here talking

35:10.280 --> 35:13.460
about these retro games.

35:13.460 --> 35:18.540
This guy does not sound like he wants to be here at all and I just, I was so bored because

35:18.540 --> 35:21.640
he was bored and it was like infectious and all that stuff.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.020
So I don't understand sometimes how some of these like bigger names and things that catch

35:25.020 --> 35:28.260
fire, uh, do as well as they do.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.260
So yeah.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.940
And I don't know either lucky to have what we have and I do mean it.

35:32.940 --> 35:33.940
We do.

35:33.940 --> 35:35.860
I just, I, I understand that.

35:35.860 --> 35:40.700
I just wish the community that I played with would stop leaving the server and I wish that

35:40.700 --> 35:45.640
they would actually play and like check cause like this entire week when I was playing,

35:45.640 --> 35:49.580
there was nobody on and I get it like fourth of July holiday and stuff like that.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.940
Probably people were gone during the week or vacationing during the summer, but like

35:52.940 --> 35:56.340
nobody was on, it was just me period.

35:56.340 --> 36:03.300
Like it's starting to, it's starting to look like the VoG Minecraft server where it's just

36:03.300 --> 36:04.300
like started off.

36:04.300 --> 36:08.300
I got like a few people playing and it was like doing all that and then nobody.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.300
So it's like,

36:09.300 --> 36:15.300
I need a button for that shade sound from RuPaul's drag race.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.340
I have a button actually.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.340
It's frustrating.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.140
I just, I wish we got more engagement.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.660
I wish we had more people playing and stuff like that.

36:23.660 --> 36:29.460
And I know like I get individuals on the server reaching out and saying, Hey, you know, you

36:29.460 --> 36:30.600
know, we want to do voice chat.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.820
We can do that or something like that.

36:31.820 --> 36:33.660
But like these people are never on it.

36:33.660 --> 36:34.660
I don't know.

36:34.660 --> 36:35.660
We'll see.

36:35.660 --> 36:39.060
I just have to stick it with it for now, but like it's getting frustrating.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.580
For what it's worth, you have some nice folks in chat.

36:41.580 --> 36:45.100
Bobby Blackwell says you're the only Minecraft YouTuber I watch.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.660
And Mike Deft uses the arrow to kind of indicate the same thing there.

36:48.660 --> 36:51.860
She Hulk suggests get a cat cam and the money will pour in.

36:51.860 --> 36:54.660
That's that's what I'm saying, you know.

36:54.660 --> 36:59.660
And again, to get a cat cam or a hot tub, hot tub Minecraft stream, Loki.

36:59.660 --> 37:02.460
I'm going to sink money in for a hot tub.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.460
Why don't you?

37:03.460 --> 37:04.460
Okay.

37:04.460 --> 37:09.260
Build a hot tub in Minecraft and call it your Minecraft hot tubs video.

37:09.260 --> 37:15.260
And then make the thumbnail something completely different.

37:15.260 --> 37:25.100
Well, it's like on TikTok, my highest hitting my two highest videos is one where I'm watching

37:25.100 --> 37:32.260
Oscar, you know, a WWE talk about her TikTok channel and one of me petting Midna.

37:32.860 --> 37:37.060
The OK, I'm a little older, so I just turned 43.

37:37.060 --> 37:39.660
I'm having a hard time understanding the tic tac.

37:39.660 --> 37:44.300
But all I know is that somebody older than you, somebody somebody told me to start one

37:44.300 --> 37:45.860
the last time I was at Rocky Horror.

37:45.860 --> 37:51.660
So pre pandemic and I did a really dumb little video on there and it has like 550 views.

37:51.660 --> 37:58.660
I'm like, OK, for like not I was like, so maybe I need to explore the taktaks a little

37:58.660 --> 37:59.660
more.

37:59.660 --> 38:05.660
I've been I've been putting up like some of my my clips from my channel and sometimes

38:05.660 --> 38:11.460
I'll like set them to an intro outro with some of my own music on it.

38:11.460 --> 38:14.060
I've seen that come through my feet, actually.

38:14.060 --> 38:17.060
So it gets it gets seen.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.660
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I joined TikTok.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.860
I haven't posted yet.

38:20.860 --> 38:27.060
I'm telling you, Bobby, post that little rap that you did or Micro Machines spiel that

38:27.060 --> 38:30.360
you did at Games Done Quick on TikTok.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.860
And that would probably get a lot of views, although to be fair, since it's really about

38:33.860 --> 38:37.460
the charity, I don't know if Games Done Quick runs a TikTok, but maybe they should have

38:37.460 --> 38:38.460
it.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.660
But I that would spread, I bet, because that was really good.

38:41.660 --> 38:42.660
All right.

38:42.660 --> 38:43.660
Well, I'll stop.

38:43.660 --> 38:44.660
I'll stop complaining.

38:44.660 --> 38:48.120
But like, yeah, so that that video will be coming very soon, depending on how long it

38:48.120 --> 38:54.660
takes to build this thing, because it's it's big, but it's pretty cool, I thought.

38:55.260 --> 38:59.260
And this is J100 Matt giving some advice, saying if your goal is to get rich quick with

38:59.260 --> 39:02.560
YouTube, it's going to take a while and a lot of dedication.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.760
Just got to keep grinding and you will get the hits.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.060
The key is posting consistently.

39:06.060 --> 39:09.060
Well, not to speak for Loki because he's right there, but I don't think it's about getting

39:09.060 --> 39:10.060
rich quick.

39:10.060 --> 39:14.960
I think it's just about can we find some new people to, you know, can we can we get more,

39:14.960 --> 39:16.120
you know, people to see this stuff?

39:16.120 --> 39:18.660
It's about visibility, I guess, maybe a better word.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.660
Yeah, it's visibility.

39:19.660 --> 39:20.660
Yeah.

39:20.660 --> 39:21.660
Yeah.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.460
I'm not looking to get rich.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.560
I mean, that's not going to happen anytime soon.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.560
No, it's just to get visibility.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.560
I basically just like I want to see like more organic growth.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.560
I do want to I'm trying to post consistently.

39:35.560 --> 39:40.160
I think I need to scale well, over scoping again, you know, I need to scale back your

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
project size.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.160
Yeah, me.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.160
Yeah.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.960
But I've been trying to like, do like stuff that's interesting, you know, and I get a

39:46.960 --> 39:47.960
lot.

39:47.960 --> 39:48.960
It depends on the style.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.460
Like there's some people that will do large builds each video.

39:52.460 --> 39:57.460
There's some people they'll just like kinda more old school where it's like, okay, and

39:57.460 --> 39:58.660
I'm wandering around.

39:58.660 --> 40:02.960
It depends on like, I have to do large builds because I have no one to interact with that.

40:02.960 --> 40:08.460
That's why if it was just like, I'm going to goof off with this person, then yeah, I

40:08.460 --> 40:09.460
could do that.

40:09.460 --> 40:13.760
But you have to have other people to interact with in order to be able to do that type of

40:13.760 --> 40:19.160
content that's I don't have that and it's it's just all me I've got to I've got to build

40:19.160 --> 40:20.160
big things.

40:20.160 --> 40:24.560
Somebody wants to goof off with Loki and Minecraft and have some fun.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.560
Hit him up on Twitter at Loki O.L.R.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.560
Yes.

40:27.560 --> 40:32.560
And we'll we'll have you join the server because there's people there's people coming in every

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
day.

40:33.560 --> 40:39.460
There's got to be somebody listening here who still plays Minecraft who would enjoy

40:39.460 --> 40:44.160
just spending an hour playing with you and doing stupid builds building the hot tub in

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
Minecraft.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.160
Yeah.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
All right.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.060
My gaming week.

40:49.060 --> 40:51.260
So I already played Dead by Daylight.

40:51.260 --> 40:52.260
I talked about that.

40:52.260 --> 40:54.960
I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14 because of course this is me.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.560
They just released a benchmark for Endwalker the next expansion.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.960
That was some big news from this weekend that I don't think is on our show roll.

41:01.960 --> 41:06.400
So you can check that out on the official Final Fantasy 14 website if you just want

41:06.400 --> 41:08.700
to play around with the character creator.

41:08.700 --> 41:13.420
So I've actually made my male Viera or my boy bunny who I've just well should I say

41:13.420 --> 41:14.420
that?

41:14.420 --> 41:15.420
No I'm not going to say the name.

41:15.420 --> 41:17.500
I'm going to have to wait because I need to make sure I can get the name before I say

41:17.500 --> 41:19.380
it because sometimes people will steal it.

41:19.380 --> 41:21.740
But I have a really good name picked out.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.860
So we'll have that.

41:23.860 --> 41:25.560
And yeah my character looks really cool.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.700
So I like the benchmark and otherwise still just trying to get all my characters to 80

41:29.700 --> 41:33.440
before the expansion comes out in Final Fantasy 14.

41:33.440 --> 41:38.520
Another game I ever played when I'd name I'd name her little bunny boo boo little walking

41:38.520 --> 41:39.700
through the forest scooping up.

41:39.700 --> 41:44.420
I like that right.

41:44.420 --> 41:51.500
So I found I found another game to play this week and it's just I don't know how I found

41:51.500 --> 41:57.020
this game all by myself completely unprovoked or told that I should check this out just

41:57.020 --> 41:58.020
out of the blue.

41:58.020 --> 42:01.120
I found myself checking out Yakuza like a dragon.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.980
I checked out on Xbox Game Pass.

42:02.980 --> 42:03.980
OK.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.100
Obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because people have been yelling at

42:06.100 --> 42:11.500
me for a very long time that I need to a play the Yakuza series B specifically this

42:11.500 --> 42:13.440
entry in the Yakuza series.

42:13.440 --> 42:18.040
So I finally around the Fourth of July holiday downloaded it because finally the bandwidth

42:18.040 --> 42:19.140
rolled over.

42:19.140 --> 42:23.000
And since we were out of town for a couple of days we didn't use bandwidth.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.040
So I was like OK this is a good time for me to download Yakuza.

42:26.040 --> 42:33.240
So I did and I've been playing it a lot since the fourth I'm already like 10 hours into

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
the game.

42:34.380 --> 42:38.980
Somewhere into like Chapter 4 at this point and I'm having a good time.

42:38.980 --> 42:44.980
Like it's it's it's I was not prepared for I knew the Yakuza was very story heavy.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.700
I wasn't really prepared for how story heavy it is.

42:47.700 --> 42:53.220
I was very like wow there is like a lot going on here and there's a lot of especially in

42:53.220 --> 42:55.020
the first chapter.

42:55.020 --> 43:00.260
It's a lot of just watching it's like a very persona kind of intro where it's like or Kingdom

43:00.260 --> 43:01.740
Hearts 2.

43:01.740 --> 43:07.380
You're just watching cut scene after cut scene after cut scene with like maybe three battles

43:07.380 --> 43:09.040
in the entire chapter.

43:09.040 --> 43:13.080
But it wasn't bad like I found myself kind of like fascinated like what's going on what's

43:13.080 --> 43:14.080
going to happen.

43:14.080 --> 43:18.800
What's you know and all this there's already like twists and things like that happening.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.480
So yeah I'm not going to spoil anything but yes I played enough to get to Chapter 4 where

43:23.480 --> 43:26.460
things start to open up and there's side quests.

43:26.460 --> 43:30.800
And because I think because this is a Sega game or whatever there are some crazy ass

43:30.800 --> 43:32.660
side quests like I laughed my ass off.

43:32.660 --> 43:38.100
There's one where you get in a little bicycle and you drive around collecting cans and it's

43:38.100 --> 43:41.180
like a little racer game that's built into it.

43:41.180 --> 43:45.460
I haven't really dinked around at the Sega arcades or pachinko machines but I know that's

43:45.460 --> 43:48.580
a full other thing too that's in the game.

43:48.580 --> 43:53.020
And then there's just like all these weird little side things that you can do.

43:53.020 --> 43:55.040
That's pretty cool.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.980
The game is dirty as hell.

43:57.420 --> 44:03.200
This is basically an NC-17 rated Final Fantasy game is what it is.

44:03.200 --> 44:12.660
It's Final Fantasy 15 and that bro quest if it was NC-17 rated is kind of what it is honestly.

44:12.660 --> 44:14.000
It's dirty.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.720
It's violent.

44:18.720 --> 44:25.920
It's got sex sex sex sex all over it and everything is boring.

44:25.920 --> 44:30.120
There's violence and a lot of uses of the F word as well.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
It's everything.

44:31.120 --> 44:37.340
All the nasty stuff you can think of it's there.

44:37.340 --> 44:42.140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's a Japanese crime drama continually interrupted by episodes

44:42.140 --> 44:43.500
of The Simpsons.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
That's a very good way of putting it.

44:45.500 --> 44:52.840
So on my Twitter I put a game capture because like I was doing a side quest and I was like

44:52.840 --> 44:57.800
look I've hosted the Rocky Horror Picture Show for like years and years and years.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.180
I've done a lot of you know other cult cinema.

45:00.180 --> 45:03.180
I've even hosted a horror movie fest and everything.

45:03.180 --> 45:06.780
It takes a lot to like make me go what the fuck is this.

45:06.780 --> 45:11.380
But there was a scene that happened in Yakuza where I was like what the fuck is this.

45:11.380 --> 45:12.960
Like what in the act.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.780
This is in my video game.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.320
This is happening.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.620
And it was it was basically a side quest in this economy.

45:19.620 --> 45:23.520
It was a side quest where you hear like a baby crying.

45:23.520 --> 45:27.160
And so it's a really short quest and this does not spoil the main story whatsoever.

45:27.160 --> 45:30.920
If you are really going to be hurt that I'm spoiling one tiny little side quest then I'm

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
sorry.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.580
That was also done in a speed run.

45:34.580 --> 45:38.240
But so what happened on the side quest you hear a baby cry.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
No this is not rugby baby.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
That's different Yakuza game.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
Oh that was different.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.240
OK.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
Yeah.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.600
There's a baby crying upstairs or something.

45:44.600 --> 45:48.840
And you have a guy who has baby formula.

45:48.840 --> 45:52.020
Long story short you decide you're going to take the baby formula up to the crying

45:52.020 --> 45:53.980
baby but you need hot water.

45:53.980 --> 45:57.420
So the side quest is you got to go to the cafe get the hot water come back and then

45:57.420 --> 46:03.020
you go upstairs and you find out that the babies that are crying are grown men and they're

46:03.020 --> 46:09.500
wearing diapers and they're being it's a fetish studio or something that you just walked in

46:09.500 --> 46:10.500
and crash.

46:10.500 --> 46:15.060
And because these guys happen to be rival Yakuza then the surprise in the side quest

46:15.060 --> 46:18.300
is these babies want to kick your ass basically.

46:18.300 --> 46:23.180
So you have to fight these man babies and then at the end you get to make a very Bioware

46:23.180 --> 46:30.320
esque choice on do you want to run out of there.

46:30.320 --> 46:35.240
Do you want to tell them off or whatever or do you want to join them and have a bottle

46:35.240 --> 46:38.080
together with them.

46:38.080 --> 46:41.800
And so of course I picked the option where I wanted to have a bottle with them and the

46:41.800 --> 46:43.760
screen just fades to black at that point.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.680
So there was that.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.340
And Bobby Blackwell says yes and then he becomes a summon.

46:49.340 --> 46:54.060
So that is a whole other thing is that instead of summons like Final Fantasy you have people

46:54.060 --> 46:58.180
you call on your phone that show up for money and kick people's ass.

46:58.180 --> 47:05.780
And so a man baby fetish dude is one of the people that you can call when you're in trouble.

47:05.780 --> 47:11.740
Let's see Mike Defton chat says that's an actual thing in Japan not not just Japan.

47:11.740 --> 47:12.740
Did you see my response.

47:12.740 --> 47:14.080
Yes I did.

47:14.080 --> 47:19.020
There's a Web site called Craigslist and there's a there's a well not sadly not anymore.

47:19.020 --> 47:22.320
There's other where one Web site goes down others go up.

47:22.320 --> 47:28.320
So yes there's there's players and kink Web sites out there that are for networking and

47:28.320 --> 47:29.680
yes it's a thing.

47:29.680 --> 47:35.120
And I'm not here to shame nobody and what they want to do consensually behind closed

47:35.120 --> 47:36.160
doors.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.620
I just was not expecting to see that in a video game like you know there's a lot of

47:40.620 --> 47:43.920
plot twists and I can call a lot of plot twists.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.600
That was not a plot twist I was prepared for OK.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.720
That's just all I'm saying.

47:47.720 --> 47:52.740
But yeah yeah whatever you want to do consensually behind closed door y'all's business.

47:52.740 --> 47:58.860
That is that is y'all all right anyway.

47:58.860 --> 48:02.400
So that's my long story about my experience of the Yakuza like a dragon.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.840
But I am I am enjoying it and the story is is good.

48:05.840 --> 48:09.480
And yeah now I'm curious to go back and check out other Yakuza games.

48:09.660 --> 48:14.460
Although I hear that the other get zero through six.

48:14.460 --> 48:15.460
Is it.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.900
And this this would kind of be seven I guess.

48:16.900 --> 48:20.180
So zero through six are like beat them ups.

48:20.180 --> 48:21.900
So they're different.

48:21.900 --> 48:27.220
But but I think the main part of it with the crazy story twists the things I'm talking

48:27.220 --> 48:30.260
about that part is still all the same.

48:30.260 --> 48:34.440
It's just the actual what happens when you get in the encounters with band dude bad dudes

48:34.440 --> 48:35.440
is a little bit.

48:36.100 --> 48:41.700
Didn't a couple of them have Kitano Takeshi doing some roles.

48:41.700 --> 48:42.700
I think so.

48:42.700 --> 48:45.460
I think he's in that rugby baby scene.

48:45.460 --> 48:46.460
Yeah he was.

48:46.460 --> 48:53.100
But he's also been like one of his big claims to fame was doing you know Yakuza movies.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.100
You know.

48:54.100 --> 48:55.100
Yeah.

48:55.100 --> 48:56.860
So anyway it's it's a fascinating game.

48:56.860 --> 49:02.820
Actually Jamie if you could you know just look away at some of the nasty stuff.

49:02.820 --> 49:04.220
Well you're you're in a grown adult.

49:04.220 --> 49:05.220
You can look right at it.

49:05.220 --> 49:08.200
It's just one of those things where it's like I think if you can kind of get through some

49:08.200 --> 49:13.360
of the weird shit there's a lot of lore in the game and I know you love lore and there's

49:13.360 --> 49:16.440
a lot to the story there are some interesting shit in it.

49:16.440 --> 49:20.140
So I got to say it might be worth your time especially if you have game pass.

49:20.140 --> 49:21.220
It's worth checking out.

49:21.220 --> 49:25.160
So yeah and I don't and I don't really touch our PS4.

49:25.160 --> 49:30.720
Oh this is actually I'm playing on Xbox but yeah I don't have a new Xbox plus when I have

49:30.720 --> 49:31.720
was a 360.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.720
I don't.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.500
It's not on 360 bummer.

49:35.500 --> 49:39.140
I don't know if I honestly I haven't cared.

49:39.140 --> 49:40.140
I'll be honest.

49:40.140 --> 49:42.020
Well that's not the kind of game I'm into.

49:42.020 --> 49:45.580
I put it off for a long time too and then I was like oh this is kind of fun.

49:45.580 --> 49:47.260
Oh PC version is coming.

49:47.260 --> 49:48.260
Got it.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.260
Got it.

49:49.260 --> 49:50.260
Well who's on the PC.

49:50.260 --> 49:51.260
I'm not.

49:51.260 --> 49:52.260
That's right.

49:52.260 --> 49:53.260
That's right.

49:53.260 --> 49:54.260
I keep forgetting you.

49:54.260 --> 49:58.060
Well you still play stuff through.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.060
I'm going to put it this way.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.480
I don't even like to watch many Yakuza movies.

50:02.480 --> 50:03.480
All right.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.480
Fair enough.

50:04.480 --> 50:08.520
It's not something I am interested in at all.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.560
But thank you.

50:10.560 --> 50:15.120
But for it to clarify for others out there who may be curious Mike Deaf does say it is

50:15.120 --> 50:16.440
on X cloud.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.360
So their their version of that.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.240
So that would allow you to play it on pretty much any any device there.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
So interesting.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
Interesting.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.240
Yeah.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.320
Questmaster says the protagonist zero through six is more serious.

50:26.320 --> 50:29.560
His persona only makes the bizarre side quests and activities even better.

50:29.560 --> 50:34.100
That would be my one read on the game is the one my one little thing is that I do get

50:34.100 --> 50:39.380
very frustrated that the main character is to put it bluntly like an idiot a dumbass.

50:39.380 --> 50:42.500
He's completely wow.

50:42.500 --> 50:46.220
And I get very frustrated sometimes I'm watching these cut scenes where I'm like let me have

50:46.220 --> 50:52.380
a human bowling ball what like playing a human bowling ball much pretty much.

50:52.380 --> 50:57.060
He's just yeah he's he gets very frustrating in some situations.

50:57.060 --> 51:02.640
But my my hope is because I'm because I already kind of see it a little bit that I'm early

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
on in the game.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.600
I'm supposed to get irritated with that.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.120
But then there's like redemption towards the end of the game where you know he becomes

51:09.120 --> 51:10.480
a lot more tolerable.

51:10.480 --> 51:18.400
But that's the one little thing where I'm like anyway all right yeah as Joe and Matt

51:18.400 --> 51:22.440
says each bonds the lovable idiot I guess his name is number one.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.600
Yeah yeah.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.760
And people call him out on that in game two which is really funny.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.540
They're like no really what's your name.

51:28.540 --> 51:31.060
I think it does get funny.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.060
It doesn't get funny.

51:32.060 --> 51:33.060
All right.

51:33.060 --> 51:34.060
Enough enough about that game.

51:34.060 --> 51:35.060
Let's talk about other stuff.

51:35.060 --> 51:38.600
Oh actually before we get into other news I do want to shout it out like four times

51:38.600 --> 51:44.300
now but I want to give officially a shout out to Vogue Network's own Bobby Black Wolf

51:44.300 --> 51:48.340
and all the other folks behind the scenes who made summer games done quick that speed

51:48.340 --> 51:49.760
running marathon happened.

51:49.760 --> 51:55.780
They raised right around two point nine million dollars for Doctors Without Borders a wonderful

51:55.780 --> 51:59.720
charity and just lots of great speed runs that were played throughout the week.

51:59.720 --> 52:02.760
And of course as you've been hearing on Vogue Network throughout the past few weeks Bobby

52:02.760 --> 52:06.360
Black Wolf he's one of the hosts during the event so he's reading donations and things

52:06.360 --> 52:11.420
and he was the host with the very last thing that you saw which was that Kingdom Hearts

52:11.420 --> 52:14.400
2 speed run where they ran that entire game.

52:14.400 --> 52:19.520
I think it was about three hours 12 minutes when all was said and I think the estimate

52:19.520 --> 52:23.760
was three hours 15 minutes and it got in right under the estimate.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.760
And it was really impressive.

52:24.760 --> 52:26.780
And the Sephiroth battle and that other one.

52:26.780 --> 52:32.580
Yeah there were those extra battles that he did too which were really all at level one

52:32.580 --> 52:35.060
which was the fascinating thing too.

52:35.060 --> 52:39.020
And it was great to watch some of the donations come in and hear some of those getting read

52:39.020 --> 52:43.100
because my favorite donation that was read they were trying to do the incentive to unlock

52:43.100 --> 52:50.220
that Sephiroth battle and somebody donated as Sephiroth and said one v one me.

52:50.220 --> 52:51.320
I thought that was really funny.

52:51.320 --> 52:54.220
And then the second one that says never mind don't can I have my money back.

52:54.220 --> 52:55.220
I did.

52:55.220 --> 52:56.220
I heard that one too.

52:56.220 --> 52:57.220
That was funny.

52:57.220 --> 52:59.340
But I laughed out loud and I heard that whole one v one me.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.340
You won't.

53:00.340 --> 53:01.340
Yeah.

53:01.340 --> 53:02.900
Dan and I had a laugh.

53:02.900 --> 53:04.140
That was pretty good.

53:04.140 --> 53:05.140
So yeah.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.140
No.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.140
Great.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.140
Great job.

53:08.140 --> 53:09.140
Great speed runs.

53:09.140 --> 53:10.140
It was it was a good time.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.140
So yeah.

53:11.140 --> 53:14.920
Looking forward to awesome games done quick which maybe they're going to do in person.

53:14.920 --> 53:19.220
They're kind of not committing to that yet which I completely understand because they

53:19.220 --> 53:22.400
got to see how things play out in the coming months I'm sure.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.600
But they're going to it is on their radar to try to get it back in person in January

53:26.600 --> 53:28.220
which they kind of mentioned there at the end.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.760
So that would be great if that can happen.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.760
So yeah.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.420
Dan and I did our donation last night.

53:32.420 --> 53:33.420
It didn't get read.

53:33.420 --> 53:34.420
But I understand.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.420
You know it happens.

53:35.420 --> 53:36.420
It happens.

53:36.420 --> 53:40.920
But I did say that I love games that have Tron levels in them.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.920
Oh there you go.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
Yeah.

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
Nice.

53:44.920 --> 53:47.920
I was waiting the whole thing for the Tron level and it was like over in five minutes.

53:48.920 --> 53:49.920
I did.

53:49.920 --> 53:55.360
I did have a donation read last night but like the first year I didn't have mine read.

53:55.360 --> 53:58.300
So it just depends on what gets through and what doesn't.

53:58.300 --> 54:01.140
And you know it all happens.

54:01.140 --> 54:02.400
All right.

54:02.400 --> 54:07.100
But if you want to hear more about the behind the scenes stuff on what they're looking for

54:07.100 --> 54:11.000
and all that stuff I will send you over to the Bobby Blackwell show and given his show

54:11.000 --> 54:15.380
a nice cheap plug there which comes on live right before us here at VOG Network or of

54:15.420 --> 54:20.140
course he has a robust part podcast archive with lots of stories behind the scenes and

54:20.140 --> 54:23.060
all of that as well over at the Bobby Black Wolf show.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.060
OK.

54:24.060 --> 54:33.780
I want to give Bobby a thank you by the way for doing the debut of my little remix.

54:33.780 --> 54:36.300
My my Sanic.

54:36.300 --> 54:38.660
So there's another reason to check out a show this week.

54:38.660 --> 54:41.820
You'll hear a lot about Summer Games done quick and you get to hear that world premiere

54:41.820 --> 54:48.620
of your Sanic Green Hill Zone remix which is which I love the Green Hill Zone music

54:48.620 --> 54:55.340
so much that I wanted to pretty much keep it like as the Green Hill Zone music but enhanced

54:55.340 --> 54:57.340
if that makes sense.

54:57.340 --> 55:00.820
It's Green Hill Zone OLED version.

55:00.820 --> 55:01.820
No.

55:01.820 --> 55:04.140
All right.

55:04.140 --> 55:05.140
Green Hill Zone Pro.

55:05.140 --> 55:06.140
It was good.

55:06.140 --> 55:07.140
It was good.

55:07.140 --> 55:08.140
All right.

55:08.140 --> 55:09.140
Let's move on.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.220
Let's get into some other gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.

55:11.620 --> 55:12.620
OK.

55:12.620 --> 55:13.620
We'll start with you.

55:13.620 --> 55:14.620
Yeah.

55:14.620 --> 55:20.580
So there is actually one of those PlayStation state of play is this week as well.

55:20.580 --> 55:25.580
And we got to see some more footage of different games some that we already knew were coming.

55:25.580 --> 55:31.220
For example we have a date now for the Death Stranding director's cut which is gonna be

55:31.220 --> 55:36.060
September 24th and they kind of showed off some new modes in there as well including

55:36.060 --> 55:41.100
a racing mode and also they announced that there's gonna be a $10 upgrade if you have

55:41.100 --> 55:44.260
the PlayStation 4 version already and that cross saves will be supported.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.340
So that's kind of cool.

55:46.340 --> 55:48.900
More footage of Deathloop.

55:48.900 --> 55:54.860
I mean we see that almost every single time so that game still looks cool.

55:54.860 --> 55:59.700
Lost Judgment looks awesome since we were just talking about Yakuza.

55:59.700 --> 56:04.020
Really looking forward to checking that one out when that comes out.

56:04.020 --> 56:05.020
What else?

56:05.020 --> 56:14.580
We have a new trailer for Jet which looks interesting Jet the Far Shore.

56:14.580 --> 56:19.260
It's kind of like a sci-fi adventure game.

56:19.260 --> 56:24.220
Fist which you know it's funny it's like I have this game confused with there's another

56:24.220 --> 56:29.460
one that just came out about like anthropomorphic animals and stuff like that in like a post

56:29.460 --> 56:31.320
apocalyptic setting.

56:31.320 --> 56:35.400
I actually thought the one that came out now was this game already but this is a little

56:35.400 --> 56:36.400
bit different.

56:36.400 --> 56:40.560
This is actually coming out now on PlayStation 4 and 5 and on September 7th.

56:40.560 --> 56:45.000
It's a side scroller game but it looks pretty awesome it's about this like rabbit character

56:45.000 --> 56:47.760
with this giant mechanical fist he fights with.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.280
Oh so it's not Watership Down.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.480
No not Watership Down.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.160
This Watership Down is like part Bionic Commando I mean that's what it kind of looks like.

56:55.160 --> 56:57.360
Watership Down the fighting game.

56:57.360 --> 56:58.960
But it looks really cool.

56:58.960 --> 57:03.000
So this looks much better than the one that just came out.

57:03.000 --> 57:09.520
A new hero shooter called Arcade or Arcade Geddon and that's something that was actually

57:09.520 --> 57:16.680
out now in early access so you can check that out and there's a new Moss game coming out

57:16.680 --> 57:22.720
so Moss Book 2 which was a game that was originally out on the PlayStation VR.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.480
So now that's getting a sequel which is pretty cool.

57:25.480 --> 57:32.160
They showed Tribes of Midgard a little bit and a new game called Hunter's Arena Legends

57:32.160 --> 57:35.920
which is another battle royale game.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
What else?

57:36.920 --> 57:37.920
Demon Slayer.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.200
I don't even know how to pronounce this.

57:40.200 --> 57:48.000
The Hinokami Chronicles and yeah I think that's about it.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.720
I noticed Seafood Flight Club.

57:50.720 --> 57:54.560
That was another game but that's been delayed till 2022 but I know that's something that

57:54.560 --> 57:57.120
showed off before.

57:57.120 --> 58:04.080
Looks a lot like what was the other I don't remember the name of the game now but yeah

58:04.080 --> 58:05.760
it looks familiar.

58:05.760 --> 58:11.620
I noticed that even though we had you know a lot of kind of newer IPs and newer ideas

58:11.620 --> 58:15.760
and maybe not AAA games but still you know they're games that are on their way out and

58:15.760 --> 58:16.960
you know a lot of them look fun.

58:16.960 --> 58:21.960
I still noticed that the state of play kind of got a very meh reaction from people online

58:21.960 --> 58:26.280
but I kind of again I think this is a case of gamers were setting their expectations

58:26.280 --> 58:31.040
a little too high because for yeah I don't know how the fuck this got this started that

58:31.040 --> 58:34.440
people were saying oh Final Fantasy 16 has to show up in the state of play.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.440
I think people were kind of making the jump.

58:37.440 --> 58:44.560
Well because Sony didn't do an E3 presentation this is Sony's E3 presentation.

58:44.560 --> 58:45.560
Oh yeah.

58:45.560 --> 58:48.520
Therefore they must show Final Fantasy 16.

58:49.480 --> 58:55.160
That's where the logic train was going on social media and this really is not what so

58:55.160 --> 59:01.080
like again Sony said it was going to be Deathloop footage and some other things.

59:01.080 --> 59:05.480
If they were going to show Final Fantasy 16 that would they were not going to bury that

59:05.480 --> 59:08.160
lead right.

59:08.160 --> 59:13.400
Well yeah exactly and also like I think these are like monthly that they do these state

59:13.400 --> 59:17.320
of plays I'm pretty sure that they did one before E3 as well.

59:17.360 --> 59:21.960
They've been doing it more regularly than Nintendo Directs to be quite honest.

59:21.960 --> 59:26.560
I don't yeah I had no expectations unless you count the indies if you count the indies

59:26.560 --> 59:32.620
then they're about the same probably sure but like I don't know it's fine I had no expectations

59:32.620 --> 59:39.800
of it I definitely wasn't expecting them announcing major new titles but yeah Deathloop is cool

59:39.800 --> 59:47.360
and all but like like I don't I feel like we're we're kind of getting into you know

59:47.360 --> 59:53.760
No Man's Sky territory it's not necessarily No Man's Sky but like Last of Us 2 and stuff

59:53.760 --> 59:58.020
like we're just like we're we're just shoving the footage down your throat it's like okay

59:58.020 --> 01:00:02.480
dude I've seen Deathloop I get the concept of the game yeah it looks cool I don't need

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.180
to see 10 minutes of footage every single state of play yeah like it's a little like

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.620
I get it it's gonna be awesome but I don't need to see it every time like we could have

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.820
cut that 10 minutes short or like spent 10 minutes promoting something else you know

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:25.080
yeah yeah I'm I think there is such a such thing as like too much promotion although

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:30.580
Sony did warn you but I think I would say that you know if Sony wanted to do a deep

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:36.140
dive on Deathloop then have a state of play or whatever be only that I think maybe the

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:41.100
problem there was that they said it was gonna be Deathloop and other stuff so because that

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.580
other stuff was so vague even though I don't think anybody should have set their bar for

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.300
Final Fantasy 16 you know if you want to see indies or you want to see you know what are

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.860
some new games that are PlayStation you know you're gonna tune in and then it's like I

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.820
have to sit through more of this game I've already seen a million I already pre-ordered

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:03.460
it you know but I guess for other people it's hype you know if it was Final Fantasy 16 I'd

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.540
probably be sitting there gobbling up each and every minute with a spoon so people are

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:12.820
into what they're into but I also speaking of that coincidentally there was an interview

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.100
very recent I think it was actually maybe during the live stream they were doing for

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:22.620
Final Fantasy 14 now Kiyoshita who's the producer director of 14 as you all know is

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:29.180
also gonna be overseeing 16 because creative unit 3 is working on both and he did say a

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.860
little bit about 16 and he did say I think he's I don't want to misquote him but it was something

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:40.020
along the lines of they may not be at Tokyo Game Show because they don't want to show the game

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:47.320
again until basically it's ready and I'm kind of like another example of how Naoki

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.580
Ashita just like gets it like he just they've announced it and now he doesn't he doesn't want

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:57.340
to do the continuous hype for the game he just wants to when it's ready here's the launch trailer

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:03.220
type of thing and and then go come out swinging and I think that's a brilliant way to do it but

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.580
should also kind of set people's expectations now he said that after the state of play but that

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.220
should also kind of set people's expectations that like you're not gonna see Final Fantasy 16

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.380
until they're ready to tell you what what day it's coming out well yeah and it's also it makes sense

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:21.140
because it's probably a lot of work for them to keep building vertical slices that show off in

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:26.300
different trailers of the game just let them develop it without having to constantly put

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:35.660
something out that you know the public can consume for sure all right um let's move on

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:41.460
and talk about something that will probably not surprise anybody but the fact that they are doing

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:47.260
another Assassin's Creed game but it might surprise you how this got unveiled Assassin's

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:54.780
Creed infinity is the new game that is coming out and it was leaked out actually at first so

01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:01.140
what happened is that Bloomberg oh you kids at Bloomberg here you go again but this one they

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.020
got right so they reported that there is a new entry in the Assassin's Creed series it was going

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:13.180
to be a live service game so it kind of cornered Ubisoft into actually confirming this it is called

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:17.940
Assassin's Creed infinity internally so I'm sorry I didn't say that I'm specifically earlier this is

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.860
a code name so it may not be the actual name of the game it's gonna be a collaboration between

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:28.940
Ubisoft Montreal and Quebec and Ubisoft in a blog post said rather than continuing to pass the baton

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.820
from game to game we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft's most beloved

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:38.820
franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner there's really no other

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.460
details from this so Ubisoft did not respond to anything else that was in the Bloomberg report

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:51.900
including that whole live service so that part also still is a rumor at this time such as Grand

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:57.500
Theft Auto five anthem those types of games usually of course Assassin's Creed games are

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.860
single-player even though they're full of DLC so this would be a little bit different the Bloomberg

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:07.580
reports isn't there for yeah they have like like almost all of their games are like live service

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:16.020
games nowadays you know with what all of their Tom Clancy games right I mean they've got so many live

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:25.740
service games it's kind of yuck also Ubisoft is yuck because you know they they basically don't

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.700
address any of the harassment that's going on their company I was actually gonna follow up with

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:36.180
that and kind of say that yeah there's all this news on Assassin's Creed infinity but the deal

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:42.540
breaker for a lot of people here is that there's still a lot of really bad stuff trademark patent

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:50.340
pending coming out of Ubisoft that seems to show that they perhaps are not addressing some of these

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:56.460
issues that have been brought to light prior and that is that is very disappointing and at this

01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:02.900
point I'm starting to wonder if Eve's given is much longer for the company because this is

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:08.860
clearly a problem that's trickling down from the top of course I have sat here and said all these

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:14.580
CEOs need to be fired not all of them but a lot of them do and it doesn't seem to happen because

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.820
I guess the money keeps coming in so I could sit here all day and go Eve's go on needs to go and

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:29.140
it probably is not going to happen however it probably should so if you want us to take some

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:34.660
of these and it does suck because of course at the end of the day there's a lot of people working

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:40.060
very hard on this who are not a part of all of that who are just trying to do what they want to

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.340
do for a living and that is make a fun video game and they're not a part of all that so it really

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:53.140
sucks that you know all this other stuff brings it down but that also highlights the reason why a

01:05:53.260 --> 01:06:05.820
figure like easy wall needs to go yeah if he really likes his employees he'll resign um let's

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:11.460
see going yeah DJ Rama s and chat says friend of mine works at Ubisoft she helped worked on I'm

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:16.420
gonna redact that just so that nobody can be identified I hope she doesn't have to deal with

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:22.140
this BS I hope not either and again like I said hopefully there's many people within the company

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:26.940
who again are just trying to make a good video game and see out their passion of designing video

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:31.700
games for a living so it sucks that this has to exist from the company or that this exists within

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:37.780
the company and that's why it is the responsibility of the management and the boardroom and the

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:46.820
shareholders at this point to cut that out surgically without anesthesia it has gone on

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:57.860
too long get in there get it out pod culture says fire them all and start over Mike deaf says

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.620
Ubisoft but not really Ubisoft more like a subsidiary of them which I think would be game

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:09.420
loft oh I think talking about something else sorry let's see Zen monkey says just do battle

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.500
royale Assassin's Creed and call it a day Ubisoft likes to make their solo play games always online

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:21.500
so why not Zen monkey says also Assassin's Creed should do what Grand Theft Auto 5 online is doing

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.980
just do an online mode and milk it for a few years they honestly don't know what to do with

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:35.420
those games um Grand Theft Auto 5 a few years 5 has been going on for it's it's gonna be a few

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:42.940
decades by the time they pull the plug on that right Loki right yeah it's been eight years now

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.660
or almost eight years it's they're not gonna pull the plug on that anytime soon I'm just

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.860
razzing you and I obviously you had a great comment there I'm just poking fun Zen monkey

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:59.620
says yeah more like a decade okay okay we agreed in let's speaking of decades and decades let's

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:06.380
throw it back with our next story Dark Sakura so I don't know if anyone remembers this because it's

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:14.740
been about 20 years rumored you know now but does anyone remember having heard of the SNK

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:22.340
millennium it was supposed to be a console that SNK was working on in theory to complete with the

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:32.620
Dreamcast and it had been mentioned around well the rumors came out around 1999 and there was

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:41.380
even some mention of it you know that like a couple of statements that there was a home

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:52.940
console SNK was working on but someone believes that they found a SNK motherboard that may have

01:08:52.940 --> 01:09:00.300
belonged to what was becoming the system Anthony Bacon who runs a YouTube channel called video game

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:09.020
esoterica did some digging with this PC motherboard and found that it was supposed to be the

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:18.020
successor to the hyper neo geo 64 but it doesn't really do a whole lot it has like a very rudimentary

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:25.860
BIOS that has the word zombie repeatedly in the code maybe that was like a a work name I guess

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:35.420
work in progress project name but with this one yeah like the president of SNK at the time

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.420
reference that they were working on the SNK millennium and there were some rumors in magazines

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:50.420
it was going to license existing CPU technology married to a matrix graph graphics card anyway

01:09:50.460 --> 01:10:04.700
what he has here is a board that is dated early 1998 and I'm just looking at some of the the

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:11.740
pieces on it just to see what was those actually yeah this was writer right before they had to sell

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:18.580
the rights to play more so anyway the board takes power doesn't do a lot else the BIOS

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:25.060
has like a bunch of just gibberish in it except for the word zombies and plain text every so often

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:31.540
but there's no games no files no software development kit no documentation if it runs

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:41.340
they don't know what operating system it would run it does use a Hitachi sh4 CPU they think it

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:48.380
might just you know run like a hello world message and then that's about it but it is though a nod

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:56.100
back to an earlier portion of SNK's history so maybe maybe one day some information will come

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:02.700
out about it maybe someone will step in and go hey I know what this is but right now all we have

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:11.700
is a kind of a unworking motherboard yeah that's okay made this must have been pulled and stopped

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.940
working on really really early on for this for so little to really exist on it but it is interesting

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:23.820
to think you know well they were thinking that direction and maybe you know especially because

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.500
you know consoles take so long to develop you know PlayStation Sony is working on PlayStation

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:41.580
6 right now it's just you know it's just a matter of you know in 98 99 this would have been close to

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:51.100
the time when the Dreamcast launched in Japan okay I mean because the the US release was in

01:11:51.100 --> 01:12:02.540
99 September 99 99 yeah so it seems to me that they were really thinking ambitiously maybe ahead

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:11.780
of themselves we know where that you know left the company ended up I mean I think that it's

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:21.580
only more in recent years that SNK is you know done a pretty decent recovery right well we'll

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:26.980
see what if maybe somebody will spill the deets on what was going on there and but probably sad

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:30.940
we're never gonna see a game I bet I don't think it was really ready for that but you never know

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:40.180
all right moving on let's talk about our next story Loki yes as if this was any surprise but

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:49.340
we knew that once the acquisition of Bethesda by Microsoft happened that all exclusive deals with

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:55.820
Bethesda titles on some platforms were definitely in question I know with like for example the next

01:12:55.820 --> 01:13:03.700
Elder Scrolls game that will be exclusive on the Xbox platforms as far as consoles go well now of

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:10.140
course the one title that they're touting over and over Deathloop is only going to be exclusive on

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:19.580
PlayStation for one year so September 14 2022 it'll be out on the Xbox platforms as well but at least

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:31.100
they have that one year allegedly allegedly yes on game pass allegedly yeah so we'll see I'm not

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:37.700
surprised really if that's the case well most of these exclusive agreements really are for just one

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:43.140
year in fact you know kind of going to another Sony exclusive still for now that Final Fantasy

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:48.940
7 remake I think many people expected that we would see that on Microsoft's platform now that

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:54.620
it's been a year but then oh now we have the PlayStation 5 version and that you know you fee

01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:01.260
DLC that possibly possibly extended the deal or something we don't really know you know we don't

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:08.180
know all the ins and outs of how that worked but it's not on Xbox yet now that story doesn't involve

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:14.580
a Microsoft own company like the Deathloop thing does now so I think it's all but certain Deathloop

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:21.180
will show up on Xbox eventually but it is interesting to kind of hear the specifics on

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:25.940
when you know and you got to wonder if that's gonna make some people wait I don't know I don't

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:31.580
know you know do we know how many like PlayStation fives versus Xbox X's are out there I felt like I

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.420
heard that there's more PlayStation fives but I don't know if that's just because it's adding

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.740
Japan into it where we know Microsoft is a non factor like I don't know is it pretty even here

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:46.860
in the u.s. or is PlayStation still ahead I don't yeah I have no idea honestly like I don't know and

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:51.220
it's not really a factor for me though because we can't get PlayStation fives and there's yeah

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:57.500
there's a handful of games that are exclusive on there that look pretty awesome but like I mean I

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:02.980
was looking forward to the next Elder Scrolls game so I'm glad I have an Xbox why have PC too

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:08.460
I guess I could definitely played on that but like you you do bring up an interesting point though

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:13.700
where it's like that exclusive window kind of dwindles down when you consider that everybody

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:21.260
who can't who wants a ps5 still can't get one and so it makes that window even smaller for when

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:26.980
people finally do get a ps5 if you know what I mean true and then deathly balls is also gonna

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:33.980
be available on PC so it's really just we're talking console exclusivity so if you want to

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:39.300
play to me you can play it on PC as well and I guess to be fair series X's aren't exactly easy

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:45.340
to come by either I'm my understanding is they are also having a hard time staying in stock and

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.940
so forth and I think that's why my brain kind of goes I think they're selling more Playstations

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:56.060
because I think they I think I just kind of I feel like most people that wanted an Xbox got one by

01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:02.220
now but I mean with games pass in the next cloud and stuff like that oh yeah yeah we have to

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.180
remember Microsoft playing a different game now that's right yeah it's very true so I mean that

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:14.740
so let's see what happens so I do want to take a small tangent and I did mention this in chat a

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:20.700
little bit yeah sure I'm wondering how future acquisitions and mergers like this are going to

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.100
go down under the new executive order who I haven't given it much thought I in fact it was

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:34.380
the first thing I thought about when I saw the the buyouts and you know when the executive order

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.900
was announced I was reading through it and I was like this is really gonna stop some of these big

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:44.820
video game companies from acquiring the smaller guys just absorbing them I'm sure they'll find

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:50.740
loopholes it's I mean they'll find loopholes I'm not familiar enough with the executive order to

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.260
admittedly I heard that it was going on and I was I was certainly interested in the parts to talk

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.580
about net neutrality and getting that back and everything but would it seemed like it was meant

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.740
to close a lot of those loopholes that people have been getting through lately what if it was

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:09.620
a Japanese company though that wouldn't it well it would affect business dealings in the US this

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:17.180
is though I mean but Microsoft is a US company true true so it would certainly affect them I

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:23.300
guess my brain goes to all those you know people that love to have those rumors about Microsoft's

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.740
gonna buy a Japanese company with all these with all these buyouts they keep doing they're good

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:34.660
they're gonna buy Konami you hear that you know way too often sure Konami would love someone to

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:45.500
buy them but you know well so the other awesome thing though is the whole elimination of Internet

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:51.380
cancellation fees and that one's really big for me mm-hmm so that they'll be better competition

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:57.220
for internet providers so people can get basically access to better internet oh so companies can't

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:03.900
lock you into two-year agreements anymore I think that it's it's if they do have a contract for it

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:09.460
that the what they can charge you would be greatly reduced interesting and that they have to be a

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:15.780
hundred percent transparent for each area what their services entail and all of the costs hmm

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:24.220
I should read up on this I'm not you'd absolutely read up on it I'll find you the link yeah I also

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:29.940
I also I also can Google I don't need I don't need I am one of those people who doesn't need

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.980
someone else to Google it for me so I wanted to put a link in the chat anyway yeah fair enough

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:40.460
all right okay let's move on let's talk about the next story which I'm sorry there's a misspelling

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:45.660
there on the sidebar let's talk about The Witcher 3 not Wither 3 that's a different game

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:54.900
that's how people feel in front of that actor withered okay so I was just making a pun all

01:18:54.900 --> 01:19:02.260
right anyway so let's talk about Witcher 3 DLC yes Witcher 3 I think many of us thought that that

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:07.340
game is done they're not going back to it why would they cyberpunk is the all the rage now so

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.780
why would they go back to The Witcher 3 well guess what they are going back to The Witcher 3 they're

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:18.140
going to be doing a free next-gen update later this year so that'll be kind of nice I imagine

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.980
they're not gonna totally you know revamp everything but they'll probably just make

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:26.620
it run a little better on the maybe better frame rate maybe some better textures or something

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:34.260
lighting ray tracing maybe on the new consoles we'll see but this is all part of Witcher con they

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:38.500
did announce that there will be a free next-gen updates that is kind of cool too is that you know

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.060
because many of you probably picked up The Witcher 3 for like 20 bucks for everything or God maybe

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:49.420
even cheaper at some point so it'll be a free upgrade and there's going to be DLC and it's

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:56.380
going to also be free and it's going to be inspired by the Netflix version of the series

01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:00.620
which is really about the books and not the games but they didn't say a little more about like what

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:09.980
that's all gonna look like or whatever they just say ooh extra items hmm interesting so yeah and

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.780
there's actually a whole little teaser thing that says The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt complete edition

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:20.740
extra items inspired by the Netflix series with a little Netflix logo there so and then I think

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:27.300
they also dated season two of the Netflix series for this fall at some point right sorry I didn't

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.780
catch a specific date I'm sure somebody will shout it out in chat because they didn't really

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:36.340
follow season one sorry it's on my to-do list so yeah there's lots of stuff and then they also have

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:41.940
an anime that's coming to do they really I miss that yeah boy Netflix loves their video game

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:46.900
anime don't they well again I guess witchers technically books but we know we know the video

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:55.340
games helped that's for sure yeah I just wish the ingress anime was good yeah true you know I

01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:00.100
skipped an ingress event today to be here with y'all on the show just because it would have

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:06.100
been appreciate your sacrifice yes thank you yes there was a thing in the Bay Area and I really

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:11.980
wanted to go to get my badge tick but I didn't because I didn't want to miss the show actually

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:18.500
I probably could have made the show but I didn't want to deal with the traffic to be honest so all

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:25.060
right um DJ Rama S and chat says Rob speaking of anime did you watch Sanrio boys yet no I need to

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:31.540
I need to I've seen y'all have sent me the pictures and everything I need to see it that's for sure

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:39.700
and my deft Oh interesting also brings this up my deft brings up go that Pokemon go fest is next

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:47.180
weekend and yeah that's a pretty big deal too I will be here for olr because thankfully they did

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:57.620
that Sunday is just the raids and I'm less like needy on those as I am the Saturday stuff where

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:02.060
they actually have all the different Pokemon and the collection challenges and all that they kind

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:07.260
of made Sunday really a footnote but we're actually gonna drive into San Francisco on

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:14.300
Saturday to play there because it'll only be like 60 some odd degrees in San Francisco on Saturday

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:19.860
where it's here it's gonna be like in the 90s again so yeah so go fast to Saturday I'll be

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:25.620
doing that but Sunday I'll be back in time for olr cuz I'm not gonna raid all day long so all right

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:35.740
let's move on Dara Sagra sure so well hackers gonna hack people are gonna try to make profit

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:43.260
off of whatever they can this a 27 year old guy in Japan was arrested after he was caught trying

01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:54.780
to sell modified Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild save files he was advertising them as quote

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:01.700
describing it as the strongest software and provide modded save files that would give players

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:09.780
different improved abilities and difficult to obtain items the whatever the customer would

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:18.820
request he was requesting 3500 yen about 31 bucks for this service and so it was spotted by the

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:25.940
Niigata prefecture police and they arrested him on July 8th for violating the unfair competition

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:32.660
prevention law and after he was arrested he admitted to selling more modded saves and

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:40.460
software's in the past and that he had sold about 10 million yen about $90,000 in the last year and

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:47.220
a half and well the judicial system in Japan is quite a bit different than it is here it's usually

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:56.540
you're accused you're guilty that's how it works so like with very few exceptions so I don't know

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.660
what's gonna happen with this guy he's gonna have to pay a lot of fines if he's actually gonna go

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:09.100
to jail or what have you but hey don't don't do it don't sell modded files it's really not a new

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:21.140
thing anyway I mean people have modified a video game software for ages there's more Nintendo

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:31.100
actually used that law to sue a go-kart company in 2017 and a different man in Japan was arrested

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:44.340
for selling cheats for Alliance of valiant arms an online shooter the the deputy director his name is

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.940
Ozakawa he's of the cybercrime countermeasures division of the Niigata prefectural police he

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:59.060
asked folks not to create sell or buy modified save data or software it's I mean here you

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:04.340
wouldn't get a smackdown for it there it's a pretty big deal and like I said the judicial

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:12.380
system is pretty tough yeah it is very interesting how that's something that is so frowned on there

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:18.140
but here I don't I mean I don't know a lot of people that kind of like buy save files as it

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:22.980
is I don't know if there's a huge market for that here I mean it's the internet whatever but yeah

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:28.780
it's interesting how I mean it would have to be dealt with more of it in a civil manner here where

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:34.380
Nintendo would take somebody to court for selling like modified versions or whatever like if that

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.540
if that were something they were gonna even chase which they I don't think they really do unless

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:46.620
they tack it on to something else so yeah and did your own ass and chat brings up oh yeah Mari

01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.780
car we talked about that on anime jam session shout out Tuesday nights yeah that's a little

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:56.100
different though that's more of like you know stealing your intellectual property versus like

01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.100
I modified a game save I mean I guess I guess it's my intellectual property because it's a

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:09.100
game safe but like yeah that's like it's the same law ridiculous same law though yeah so so if I if

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.380
if just if I accuse them then they're guilty right so then I'm just gonna accuse them of

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:22.700
perpetuating joy-con drift then where's my billions of dollars you'd really need to look

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:28.100
there's actually a really good documentary about prisons in Japan that talks a lot about the

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:32.500
prosecution that if something actually goes to a prosecution you're pretty much gonna get put away

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:42.020
hmm all right well let's move on to something that may end up in a court somewhere Loki

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:50.060
yeah so this is interesting there's a brand new set of like cheap programs or software or

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:55.020
something like that that this cheat maker is basically saying is undetectable on consoles

01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:01.620
and PC the reason it's undetectable it's at least that's what they're alleging is because

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:09.980
it actually involves like a separate PC so basically taking video from your console or

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:17.580
your PC and then kind of running that through a separate PC with this program that then I guess

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:25.780
adjust I don't know if it's I would assume it's connected to your input somehow but it allows

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:34.060
they basically to do all the aim botting and stuff like that via AI and machine learning and stuff

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:44.060
like that so interesting of course the game that they're promoting with this right now is Call of

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:52.060
Duty and you know Activision is not having that so they actually were advertising this on YouTube

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:59.780
and they've taken the ad down now it's been struck with a copyright claim by Activision Publishing

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:08.140
so yeah I can only imagine this is gonna end well but it is they're building better cheat software

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:13.900
you know they're getting around stuff like that it stuff like that is gonna be harder to detect

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:21.260
especially when it's not directly modifying the console it's basically like an in-between the

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:32.060
console and you know the player so good luck yeah but it's like I can I give the YouTube and

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.860
copyright strike stuff a lot of shit because it's it's way overused and it never is seems to be on

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:42.860
the side of the creators but I'll give them this one like that's a pretty clever way to get the

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.940
ad down for you know your game which you know again if you're gonna use these aim bot things

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.140
and you're using if you're using them in multiplayer environments like Call of Duty

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:58.380
I'm sorry you're the bad person here not Activision not YouTube you're the bad person here if you're

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:02.580
using them in single-player mode go off I don't give a fuck do whatever you want to do in

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:07.860
single-player mode it's when you use this stuff to intentionally try to grief other people or get a

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:13.700
leg up on something that to feel like you're good at something when you're not and you're just

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.740
cheating and everybody knows you're cheating and the more you get up the ladder the more that

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:23.460
that shit always comes out at the end of the day always comes out at the end of the day yes it

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:28.900
especially when you see like you know streamers and stuff like that getting caught with some of

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:36.100
this stuff it's it's ridiculous but yeah I don't I don't get the point of cheating to make it way

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:40.980
up a ladder to brag about how good you are the game because you you're not suck at the game you

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:46.980
suck at it you're quite bad yeah I think these people they just can't really they don't really

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:52.780
care they just know I know but but I beat you so you're just mad you know like yeah cry more

01:29:52.780 --> 01:30:00.260
cry more nerd yeah that whole thing exactly yeah it's it's silly yeah I mean you know there's

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:05.540
people in you know the online game obviously dark soccer and I both I'm in both play wait

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:11.740
way too much of his dead by daylight and I see hackers in that game once in a great while but

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:17.540
I don't I don't give them the kindness of a reaction I give them a swift right-click block

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:24.420
I don't want to see this bitch again that's what that's it for me so all right yeah Alan had a

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:32.100
match yesterday where there were seven people in the match somehow yeah okay so I've seen videos

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:39.500
of like there was there was a thing going on for a little while where people were getting two

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:49.780
killers that's wild is this was I think a couple of releases ago but I was in fact as I think I was

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:58.660
seeing this on like a polyester video hmm where they were trying to figure out which killer had

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:05.740
the act of terror radius because only one of them did but both were affected by survivor actions

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:10.020
it was really crazy but this is actually a glitch but I think that there's something in there that

01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:16.900
people have been exploiting yeah and I want no part of that like again if you're just gonna cheat

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:24.980
at a game like congrats you did nothing like you just you just wasted everybody's time congratulations

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:30.780
including yours yeah all right all right let's move on while dark soccer continues to give us

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:36.060
kiddie shots let's move on and talk about one more story here before we get into our classic of the

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.820
week will you can see there on the side that maybe we're doing something special tonight but we'll

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:47.660
get into that in a minute first we'll talk about Atari why not let's talk about who how many out

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:55.900
there got your Atari VCS no exactly but anyway that you see I've already got a PC so I didn't

01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.900
buy one well guess what Atari is gonna be getting even more into PC stuff because Atari is said that

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:05.340
they are going to be getting away from mobile gaming a little bit this is a recent report from

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:12.540
games industry dot biz a statement by the new CEO Wade Rosen of Atari says quote our intent with give

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.620
with any gaming experiences to provide accessible and joyful moments of meaningful play that's

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:22.380
the core of Atari and what binds our history with our future to that end we feel that premium

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:28.220
gaming is better representative of this type of gaming experience and the Atari DNA so they're

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:33.100
going to be reducing the free-to-play mobile gaming stuff and concentrate instant on premium

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:39.540
PC and console gaming of course I we get like a new IP Atari I mean because like honestly they've

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:45.380
just been re-releasing their old stuff I'll take to death I'll take new games out of the old stuff

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:53.480
if they're good like right well I take a castle crystal castles like remade hell yeah but it

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:59.180
better be awesome you know there be ray-traced crystal castles I want to shine in those crystals

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:04.100
hell yeah exactly see that would be fun crystal castles I bet would make kind of an awesome

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:12.060
platformer type of game but what do I know anyway I guess there's let's see they're gonna sell or

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:17.860
shut down some of their mobile IPs including roller coaster tycoon stories crystal castles

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:24.500
I guess is on mobile I didn't even know that Atari combat tank theory and ninja golf didn't know that

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:28.420
wasn't it I guess that's one of those new IPs you can look forward to from Atari I don't think

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:35.940
no it is like the game was very good ninja golf was on this the 70 70 800 oh wow okay it was a

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:41.220
joke gone bad all right I didn't know it even dated back there Wow all right no word on the

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:47.660
Atari hotel though I'm still waiting on that one there is that by the way since we brought up Atari

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:55.700
y'all want to bring up in television sure it's been an interesting thing here's the thing so

01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:03.180
they've had an interesting week on Twitter because Tommy's Tommy likes to talk and he'll of course

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:10.260
talk about top CEO of in television and now in the amico and all that stuff and he's he's kind of

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:16.620
he's cooked himself a little bit on Twitter by engaging in conversations he probably shouldn't

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:21.780
be having and he kind of knows this so look I'm gonna I'm gonna make this long story short not

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:26.740
that I think that Tommy listens to this show but I also kind of believe if you say his name three

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:32.420
times in the mirror he does have a tendency to show up to defend the amico so I will I will try

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:37.380
to risk here and here's my honest-to-god advice with Tommy and I'm not this isn't to like knock

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:42.340
him or anything we've had him on this show before I think he's a fascinating interviewer I think he

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:47.820
really are a fascinating interviewee I think he really believes in the product I I still I'm I

01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:54.380
pre-ordered that amico I'm interested in it I'm curious what it's gonna do my honest advice though

01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:01.460
in television needs to have some more spokespeople and not just one because when you put everything

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:07.900
in the hands of one person that's when things can make or break for everybody if you know what

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:13.460
I mean right look at a company like Nintendo Nintendo didn't just have Reggie Fils-Aime

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:19.700
or intent Nintendo had Satoru Iwata rest in peace by the way I believe today is the anniversary of

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:28.780
his passing if I'm not mistaken Nintendo had Miyamoto Nintendo had other vote now they have

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:34.860
Doug Bowser of course Nintendo has Nintendo also has Sakurai you know and I you know and all that

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:40.300
and the memes the great memes of please do not ask me for this again a good gaming company has

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:45.860
lots of different spokespeople to promote the product and I think this is something in television

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:51.980
if the events of the past week and everything I think really shows they really need that and if

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:58.380
Tommy's not willing to have that I think that's and here's the thing I'm sure the response would

01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:04.060
be something like but but but we have these developers over here we have this over and this

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:11.580
goes back to one of our big golden rules here at OLR and that is the truth doesn't matter it's

01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:16.460
what's perceived that matters and there's only one person out there doing interviews on Amico

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:24.700
right now as far as we can all see so my strong advice get some other people out there to really

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:32.700
show that this system is for more than one person all right anyhow let's Oh see dark to see you says

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.700
I do love the ideas he was bringing to the table yeah I'm not knocking the system or anything like

01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:43.580
ice I and I do think when he argues you should try it before you knock it I think that is a fair

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:50.980
request 100% and I I completely agree there's probably a lot of youtubers out there who want

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:56.260
to see this thing fail who have no intention of ever trying it or giving it a chance which again

01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:05.500
hurts developers at the end of the day so again that's why my my suggestion is show more of those

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:11.900
people show some of these other people contributing to this system success and I think maybe you'll

01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:16.860
get a different result a little bit there but dark to see it does agree everything that I'm

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:22.460
saying tire con chat says in television needs a PR agent unfortunately they probably have one but

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.660
it's also one of those things where it's like sometimes you hire the person that lets you do

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:35.980
whatever you want hmm right yeah like such as I'm sorry I'm sorry to bring this individual up but

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:41.020
such as our former president you know he only hired people and surrounded that we're gonna

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:49.340
agree to everything you wanted anyway well until they absolutely couldn't yeah and until finally

01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:55.580
you know it was all taken away but anyway let's move on let's let's move on to another let's let's

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.980
look back on fonder times let's go way way way back and look on some fonder times in our next

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:17.380
segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:29.020
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of something special it is a lot

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:36.860
more special and it is indeed a very special game we're doing a flag which is the fucking weird

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:45.460
arcade game and this one and I'm actually encompassing two together they're ones at sequel

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:55.660
but the game is called Sonic blast man and then the sequel Sonic blast heroes and I'm bringing up

01:38:55.700 --> 01:39:05.580
specifically the arcade version because the arcade version is the weird one so basically you have a

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:16.460
setup where it's you've got this target in front of you that you punch and you punch it at certain

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:22.740
intervals in the game imagine like a reverse punch mania I guess for people who have actually played

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:36.540
a punch mania so it's you basically are playing a superhero and you have different well different

01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:43.580
rescues that you have to perform and so you have to basically hit the enemies and different targets

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:51.260
and you in each target has a number of tons of resistance and so once you've depleted that ton

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:58.220
of resistance they'll be defeated so you have a pair of gloves and this mechanical punch pad so

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:04.100
you have to wear the gloves and punch strongly enough to deal the damage only three hits are

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:13.340
allowed so you have five stages and then they're like mostly typical rescuing of people scenarios

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:22.100
you have a woman who is being assaulted by a thug you have a baby carriage pushed into the middle of

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:29.900
the freeway by accident and that a truck will run over an armed group that takes control of the

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.860
building and is now the center of operations you have a giant crab terrorizing a cruise ship and

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:42.420
an asteroid that's set to crash into the earth now an interesting thing about this and if you're

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:55.820
watching the the video this is a words this one is a sonic blast heroes that we're watching but

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:03.140
it the in 1995 the original was recalled because of players who sustained injuries by playing the

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.420
game and then the Consumer Product Safety Commission said that Taito had to pay a fine

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:16.300
a fifty thousand US dollars for failing to disclose the injuries and of course what we're

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:26.740
seeing here is that we are looking at now the the the official sequel sonic blast heroes with

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:31.740
new touched-up graphics and you know that's basically still the same the same kind of game

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:42.660
so it did get a console release and who knows maybe this will get its own classic game segment

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:52.060
but it came out on the SNES as a beat-em-up and in this one you have to save earth from different

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:58.460
kinds of forces like street gangs and terrorists and aliens and robots and evil clone called heavy

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:09.020
blast man and it's a one player only I mean it's a beat-em-up there are also bonus levels that are

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:16.620
adaptations of the arcade version so since there's no like punch pad for strength you have to repeat

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:27.020
repeatedly rotate the d-pad it was it was definitely censored for the u.s. in Japan you

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:36.300
had female enemies in the u.s. you did not and it actually had a sequel as well on SNES sonic

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:44.540
blast man to you with different player characters that you had so actually there is the actual

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:51.420
sequel to sonic blast man is called it's more like a spiritual sequel called real puncher very

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:57.660
similar to the original game that has like a photo mode for the places for the faces of people in

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:06.460
each of the levels and it was released outside the side of Japan as a ticket redemption game so so

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:12.100
yes and then there's the other sequel so yeah there were more than one sequel so sonic blast

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:21.700
heroes was announced in 2010 in February and it hit the arcades around the same time and outside

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:31.340
of Japan it was called real puncher 2 and that's it weird-ass game they should make a one punch

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:40.620
band spin off of this game they should I mean it would fit since but for him you could only get one

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:47.020
punch you've got timing yeah I I apologize as I ran away to the restroom while you're talking

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:52.100
about this game but if you have you actually played this game out of curiosity this one yeah

01:43:52.100 --> 01:44:03.940
yes nice what I feel like I've seen it and it hurt my wrist oh no all right all right well there

01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:10.380
it is your plan oh go ahead and to answer gg around my ass and I don't know if he sent this

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:15.740
comment before I read that it was um wasn't sonic blast man one of the first games for super

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:23.460
Nintendo and yeah and that's the one I was talking about it was pretty early for the system it wasn't

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.980
one of my favorites to play out of the end of the beat em up so I was more of a final fight person

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:34.820
but it wasn't bad and I was glad that they could at the time that I played it I didn't know that it

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:44.340
was an arcade game I got to play one at it was at some little indie arcade that happened to have

01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:50.900
one and then like I hurt myself after I played it and I decided not to play it again the end

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:58.340
all right we'll keep those flags coming that was a fun one so yeah there it is your classic flag

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:06.500
of the month all right a pair a pair a matching pair this this month all right let's get in excuse

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:12.940
me hiccups let's get into our rapid-fire news segment here I have some coffee brewing so I'm

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:19.340
gonna go grab that so let's get right to Loki and some rapid-fire news so Pokemon go is making lots

01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:26.340
of money they've ranked are rigged in so far five billion dollars since launch so I'd say the game

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:32.020
successful I guess or maybe it's dead you know Pokemon goes dead that's what really we should be

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:40.500
taken away from this and then there was a new world or a couple of world records set for a

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:51.540
collection of old retro I guess LCD games so Linda Gilroy's she's got two different records

01:45:51.540 --> 01:46:00.020
for one for having a collection of almost 1600 LCD gaming systems which is pretty awesome and

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:06.740
then also two thousand four hundred and thirty playable gaming systems so I'm assuming consoles

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:16.700
outside of that she's uh she's got more than love than Jamie's vault there so no I don't know

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:27.820
where's your world record for that but yeah so it's pretty cool to see the collection that she

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:32.860
has they have a video on YouTube about it and stuff so definitely worth checking out but yeah

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:39.660
those LCD games are pretty awesome group on that stuff so yeah I remember playing a I used to have

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:46.340
a Castlevania to Simon's Quest LCD game not as old as some of the like relaxing and stuff that

01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:53.980
they're showing but fun stuff I used to love those LCD games I don't think I owned a lot of them

01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:58.940
myself but I love those games and that's an impressive I didn't even know they made that

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:03.260
many of them so very impressive collection we just have to collect all those little mini

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:07.740
cabs now they can get a world record for that yeah I'm sure somebody's got me beat there

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:13.140
because there's too many of them now like somebody sent me a little um like it's like the tiny arcade

01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:17.540
and it was like I was Hello Kitty pac-man or something like that and as neat as it looked

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:21.700
those really really tiny ones that are almost like keychain size they're not my favorite but

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:28.740
I guess when you're collecting things you still want them all you know so you know so because I

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:34.620
have a few of them so but yeah I didn't I didn't want to go seek out one of these Hello Kitty ones

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.980
but I like like the one that Alan got me a few weeks ago live on the show you know they're they're

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:47.100
pretty impressive now yeah the Galaga tabletop arcade went up oh really I don't know you guys

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:52.700
got yeah I think we got it like way dirt cheap you probably when when Loki was on here going

01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:56.780
there 50 bucks at Walmart right now you probably jumped on one of those yeah I think Dan got it

01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:03.940
somewhere else but but yeah it was it's pretty cool that's awesome yeah I'm hoping I'll have

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:10.580
some more space soon to expand those a little bit but I'll talk about that later all right let's

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.940
move on and travel around the world and check out some really oh I'm sorry we've been I'm sorry no

01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:23.900
we need to do dark soccer's rapid-fire news then we do really dark soccer yeah that's okay um so

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:33.340
there is these pictures have been posted of an Animal Crossing monopoly and I mean it looks

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:42.700
pretty legit I mean it's got all the right stuff on the boxes it said that it was I mean some people

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:50.940
are saying that it's a rumor but I mean apparently Hasbro released one but Nintendo Hasbro or

01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:58.340
Nintendo hasn't said anything about it yet there is a list for the game on Zato games UK website

01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:05.380
for it but the reddit user that talked about it posted some pictures of the game and so we have

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:13.140
like Isabel inside the box welcome to your deserted island getaway and it has the cards

01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:18.980
has a little punch outs for bells and coins and fruit and fossils you have four little figures

01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:27.300
which there's only one girl and she's wearing pink which is terrible but the box looks really

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:37.060
cute the the back of it looks really cute I mean it seems fairly likely so I guess that you're

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:47.100
using your your fossils and whatnot little tokens instead of houses and whatnot so oh yeah probably

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:55.340
yeah SSG 100 Matt suggests is mr. Resetti jail you know I didn't look hold on because I'm gonna

01:49:55.340 --> 01:50:00.580
look at the I'm looking at the play field no they know they he's not on there they cheaped

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:07.020
out by having just the traditional go-to-jail thing but it really should have been poor

01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:13.060
Resetti yeah he really got a raw deal in this latest he's traumatized an entire series of

01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:22.180
childhoods you know yeah and I love him for it mm-hmm so the other story here there you know we

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:26.780
we've every so often brought up different unopened games we have an unopened Legend

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:34.460
of Zelda from 1997 and it does look like it's a gold cartridge sold for 87 hunt no sorry for

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:43.460
eight hundred seventy thousand dollars and of course heritage auctions in Dallas put the is

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:51.540
what hosted the sale and the same auction house is the same one that sold the unopened copy of

01:50:51.540 --> 01:51:01.740
Super Mario Brothers that someone forgotten his desk drawer since 1986 but yeah I mean if you

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:06.140
maybe I should never have removed the shrink shrink wrap from my copy of guitar ooh man

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:18.980
maybe we should sell an NFT of episode one let's do it well so we'll sell just enough so that we

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:23.820
can get pizza that's probably that's probably how much it would ultimately go for would just

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:30.500
buy a pizza maybe two we should hey if someone buys us a pizza we'll give you the first episode

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:39.940
no no no no I'm kidding I do not send you do not we'll send you a screenshot from the old webcam

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:49.540
you are not Homer Simpson and you are not selling the show for a forbidden donut I'm joking I mean

01:51:49.540 --> 01:52:00.460
like just like an audio clip I'm like audio clips that would be NFT worthy but I forbid those from

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:06.980
ever happening did your MS says you can actually do that it's called treat stream no we're not

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:11.900
we're not getting any NFT business I don't until until it makes sense to me we're not getting into

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:23.860
that you want to really impress us get people to listen to the show I'll sell a pair of my

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:29.940
socks for like a good pizza I'm so excited for conventions to come back so I can actually like

01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:34.980
tell people about this show again that'd be very nice we can maybe get some more listeners well

01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:45.060
um next year though I mean I'm planning a derpy con and and dragon con although I really want to

01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:51.140
do twitch con now oh yeah twitch con would be a lot oh my god twitch con would be off the hook I

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:56.300
really now I really want to do that yeah yeah I doubt it's gonna happen this year because that

01:52:56.300 --> 01:53:01.900
would be a little soon because yeah that usually that was in like October November I think and I

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:07.220
think we would have heard by now if they plan on doing that but yeah 2022 for sure that'd be great

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:13.820
and I know some local cons are starting back up like there's gonna be a I think there's a sinister

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:19.940
con out in Roseville in August and I'll probably just show up say hey I don't think I'm doing it

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:28.020
official capacity there but November 14th is glitch con oh where's that at it's online okay

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:37.900
yeah nice let's see pod culture says trying to suss out how to get that click out which I think

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:42.540
is actually a response to editing a particular past episode of our show but I think it's a good

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:47.180
we're trying to suss out and get the click out that is exactly what we're trying to do for OLR

01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:56.660
as well so I read it anyway there it is Carlos spanak topia a spin spin a copita sorry I'm

01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:25.220
good the DC one is DC which which DC one twitchcon no I think just maybe a convention I don't cuz I

01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:37.900

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:06.100
attention this week but we'll see all right let's move on we have some more stories for you and then

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:10.180
we'll get to your feedback in the listener roundtable I don't know if we have emails

02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:14.900
tonight though I haven't checked there I haven't looked actually all right we'll find out meanwhile

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:23.100
Loki though there is a rumor that the PlayStation Vita store is going to be I don't know if it's

02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:29.700
closed down or at least not releasing new games after July 20th this is coming from the developer

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:38.020
of a game called Russian subway dogs who is basically porting his game from PC to the Vita

02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:44.940
but basically the developer Miguel Cerber has been rushing to finish it because he had heard

02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:53.380
a rumor said it's gonna be switched off in 2021 but basically saying that you know right now it's

02:00:53.380 --> 02:01:00.380
kind of a passion project of his to get it translated but yeah I don't know where the

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:07.740
July 20th date necessarily gets mentioned here but I do know that at least he's trying to rush

02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:12.820
to get it done but that's the rumor date for right now so we'll have to see what happens with that

02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:18.540
you know wasn't this the whole wasn't this the whole thing like about a year ago that Sony was

02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:23.380
threatening to close down this store in the PlayStation 3 store and people really were up

02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:29.460
in arms about it because there wouldn't be a way to play a lot of those classics if the store goes

02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:34.580
down there's still a lot on PlayStation 3 you can't get anywhere else so it's interesting that

02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:41.700
this is coming back now yeah I'm still trying to like the developer doesn't necessarily mention

02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:50.300
the July 20th date so I'm just trying to figure out where they get that from so I don't know but

02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:59.260
we'll see we'll see what happens it's not that long from now all right well a game I never shut

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:03.700
up about here on OLR is Final Fantasy 14 and I never shut up about it because I really enjoy it

02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:08.700
I don't know if I enjoy it this much but I bet other people do to the extent that they would buy

02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:15.140
a cookbook based on Final Fantasy 14 it's interesting the cookbook is for 14 and not 15 15

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:21.860
yeah exactly but to be I kind of think there already is one for 15 to be honest what so there

02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:28.620
is that going on so yeah a Final Fantasy 14 cookbook was spotted and I guess it was named

02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:33.780
something a little bit more generic but some digging from good old warrior of 64 on Twitter

02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:39.700
found out that this book is slated to launch on November 9th 2021 it has a forward written by

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:45.500
Naoki Ishida and it's gonna cost about $35 of course we don't know what recipes if popoto soup

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:51.780
or whatever are going to be in there but I guess stay tuned for all the details on that sometimes

02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:56.300
these things come with like a special code for an in-game item as well and that'll make it more

02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:00.980
desirable this was also a reminder to myself to bring up the benchmark that just came out over

02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.580
the weekend for Endwalker but I already talked about that earlier in the show so I guess I don't

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.780
need to say that again but dark soccer this might be something that interests you maybe maybe I mean

02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:16.980
I like I like video game cookbooks a whole lot so it is a it is a fun little niche right like it's

02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:23.500
like not something you see a lot but it's kind of funny when it's there so no one special 77 in

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:30.180
chat says if it isn't in the cookbook there should be a recipe for KFC Kentucky fried chocobo not

02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:35.220
funny anyway fifth dream says who wrote the cookbook I was helping the author of the Wow

02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:42.340
cookbook the GOT cookbook gather recipes from 14 and 15 but nothing came of it yet she wrote a

02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:47.380
Star Wars cookbook too I don't have the name in front of me I'm sorry I cuz I don't know if I

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:52.140
think it's they're finding figuring this all out from the Amazon description for an untitled

02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:56.580
project so I don't know if they actually know who the author of it is yet but that would be

02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:07.180
really interesting if the same person so all right let's move on dark soccer so I'm saying

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:13.540
this with with the hope that we don't get into the big police discussion but it is going to touch

02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:21.500
on it so I'm leaving a trigger warning for that right now so there the the New York Police

02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:27.140
Department is rolling out this thing called a game truck they've already done it once but they want

02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:34.940
us there there say their goal is to connect with youth particularly in low-income neighborhoods so

02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:44.620
they said it's like a like an olive branch of sorts to sort of repair a relationship because

02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:53.340
there's been so much deserved mistrust so the chief of community affairs for the department

02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:58.580
has said and I'm just gonna read the the quote we're coming to your block we're coming out to

02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:03.260
your neighborhood make sure our young people have a safe summer a safe place and know that

02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:11.620
NYPD is here to support them so the truck has different gaming consoles including switches

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:18.060
ps5s Xbox Series X and they just want to connect to the young people that's what they said it's

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:24.260
painted with various Marvel characters and the word NYPD game truck I don't know what comic book

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:27.740
characters really have to do with video games apart from there being video games that contain

02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:32.940
comic book characters but whatever you know that's when you let non gamers decide you know

02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:45.820
do your marketing well it was free candy anyway they're they're saying that this is trying to

02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:51.700
engage with the youth for extracurricular activities the first truck was spotted over

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:58.340
the July 4th weekend in the north end of Manhattan's East River Park near several of

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:04.500
the New York City Housing Authority buildings there's another truck in Bushwick neighborhood

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:14.220
it there now here's what the critics are saying is that there are people who want to think that

02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:20.320
this is well-intentioned but it's another reflection and it's actually stated by

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:29.780
oleami olorian has a public defender with the Legal Aid Society not AIDS but Aid Society that

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:36.180
they try to intertwine themselves into the communities quote it's really it's really

02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:40.420
just another means of indoctrinating people into believing the police are necessary and have to be

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:45.500
around and it's another way in which the same communities are forced to have constant police

02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:57.860
presence end quote there's also some practices they like for example in 2018 they were questioning

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:03.540
a 12 year old boy suspected of committing a felony they gave him a soda from McDonald's the

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:09.700
interview was over the boy was let to go but they recovered the straw and entered his DNA into a

02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:17.220
database it didn't link him to any crimes the family had to petition a court to have it removed

02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:23.700
but I mean they're breaking laws so they're thinking that because of incidents like this

02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:36.220
that they might be using these kids going into the the vans or whatever as a means to collect

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:44.620
DNA another quote by Marianne Kyshian who is a senior policy counsel with Brooklyn Defender

02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:51.460
Services her quote says for decades the NYPD has aggressively sought to target and serve survey

02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:57.620
New Yorkers particularly young black and brown people and to harvest and catalog their DNA in

02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:06.300
the secretive internal archives such as the gang database and rogue DNA database it it may seem a

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:14.220
little bit what's what I'm thinking of almost conspiracy theory is except the fact that they

02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:22.300
have done it before they're over survey survey doing over surveillance basically taking up some

02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:35.380
predatory practices at least according to a lot of people NYPD didn't respond to any requests for

02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:45.500
comments on this and none of the associated facilities have but there was I mean but it was

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:52.700
you know said by at the time the chief of detectives German Shay night in 2018 that there

02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:58.980
is the NYPD criminal group database or quote gang database that was made up of 99% non-white people

02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:04.140
particularly black and Latino young men with children as young as 13 years old being added

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:14.940
into it so there is definitely precedent for it however I'm going to go on the fence with this

02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:24.660
one I think that it is a well intentioned plan you know and I think trust does need to be rebuilt

02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:32.340
but I think they have to earn that trust you know they have to do more to earn the trust and I don't

02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:38.940
think putting out a truck with video games to get some kids into play is gonna do it they need to be

02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:45.020
massive overhauls yep I'm gonna I'm gonna just say agree and I'm gonna read some chat comments

02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:50.060
that I think are pretty please please read Ron was our yeah our New York fam is lighting up on this

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:55.740
so yes of course I'll start with Rama so Rama says so let me say this since I live in NYC and

02:09:55.740 --> 02:10:01.940
I'm a targeted person lol I think this is a good idea because the NYPD does have community

02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:06.900
initiatives some are saying that this is a trap to suss out gang members I don't defend the NYPD

02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:13.780
but I feel they're trying we just need better people in the NYPD to help with this I want to

02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:18.700
read SHO 100 Matt's comment as well basically you got to go a long way to gaining trust in

02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:23.980
communities gaming truck is nice and all but you got to have decades of trust to regain for some

02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:29.060
folks and that's kinda that's kind of where my head is out with it is I and I think the the

02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:34.380
well-intentioned part is is accurate it's one of those it's a especially when you paint Marvel

02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:38.700
characters on the side of it and somebody in Chad had also said how do you do fellow kids with that

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:45.180
whole thing yeah there is a part of me that kind of like gold star you tried you get the you tried

02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:51.780
start you it's well-intentioned you tried but it doesn't address the real issues it makes me think

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:59.300
of I'm gonna put it this way imagine you have a diabetic foot with neck necrotic tissue on it

02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:04.700
now imagine just putting a band-aid and send me a spore and on it that's what this feels like to

02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:09.060
me you might feel better for a little bit and that one little part might get a little bit better but

02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:14.540
there's still a big festering necrotic wound underneath it that needs to well and when you

02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:21.220
get to that point you need to cut some things out of it and replace things with good good tissue or

02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:27.100
packaging or you know prosthetics at that point that's my thought about it is that it might not

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:37.860
be enough you've got to get and I know this is very broad and generalized you need to get the the

02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:43.900
damaged tissue removed you need to remove the people who are going along with it who are

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:50.620
silencing others and are focusing on their own personal gain and personal power and we need to

02:11:50.620 --> 02:12:00.140
bring back a police that is held accountable and also fairly holds itself accountable so that's my

02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:07.300
two cents on it this is this is a very small this is a little bit of gauze and Neosporin where what

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:16.980
you need is like debridement and yeah um deejirama s in chat saying basically agreeing with what you

02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:21.660
said but also wanting to say Marvel is popular and Marvel is in NYC so in a way it does make

02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:27.500
sense that way all right I'll give you that bonds 006 was to chime in to saying also living here in

02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:32.660
NYC Rama and I can speak volumes I have literally seen one of those gaming trucks six doors down

02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:40.980
from my door right across a basketball court and slash school building interesting and Rama wanted

02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:45.860
to add we'll get one more comment here from Rama and then we'll move on saying and I grew up in the

02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:50.620
projects you know the bad part of town the parts of town where the cops are a lot which causes a

02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:56.740
lot of these issues all I can say is that you have to live here to understand it so yeah but even if

02:12:56.740 --> 02:13:02.140
you can you can listen to people as well and learn some stuff from the people that are there

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:09.580
and stuff that's why y'all's comments please bear in mind that Marvel is a lot more than just the

02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:16.300
films where they're filmed has nothing to do with the comics all right just saying um let's go ahead

02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:22.180
and move on to our next story because this is uh this is one of those things where I'm like wow

02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:27.940
but also not surprised Loki I don't know how to set this up for you but it's all I have to say

02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:35.900
is the word is de nouveau and so you know it makes sense that one we had a cracking group called

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:41.820
Empress remove the DRM including Dean nouveau from Resident Evil 8 they're doing the Lord's work

02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:49.300
it not only allowed them to play it without DRM but also allowed them to play without the

02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:57.220
stuttering issues that they've been having in the game since back in May and apparently like all the

02:13:57.220 --> 02:14:03.260
game in-game stutters when you kill zombies or whatever been fixed because cap comes DRM entry

02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:08.180
points have been patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore this results

02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:16.980
in a much smoother gameplay experience like that that's a problem when your DRM causes performance

02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:22.660
in game and the pirates are having a better game experience than your actual paid customers that's

02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:33.100
how you that's how you get more pirates Capcom so maybe cut it out yeah this this whole thing speaks

02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:37.620
volumes you know and I can't stop laughing at dark soccer saying they're doing the Lord's work

02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:43.580
but in a way they are because it's one of those things where if the game runs better without it

02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:49.620
it just encourages people to look into these types of things that perhaps they would have wouldn't

02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:55.300
have looked into otherwise that's bad especially if Capcom can't lock that shit up now like now

02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:59.860
then this story is just gonna spread and people are gonna see this headline oh how do I get

02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:08.060
Resident Evil 8 to run better on my system oh I just steal it I see this is not a great situation

02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:14.340
for Capcom and it's a really not great thing for due to ovo or whatever but people need to stop new

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:22.060
oh yeah new vote to get get out oh that's I it's it's terrible and I know we've never heard a good

02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:28.180
story about it look I understand that companies want to protect their shit and I do not endorse

02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:36.540
piracy here but when this types of stuff happens it is very embarrassing for all these companies

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:42.100
that it's like it's it's so obviously shines a spotlight on what the flaw is in the game when

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:46.300
it's impacting performance like that yeah and we're not seeing that people are pirating the

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:52.660
game necessarily with the cracked version you can crack a paid version as well and you know if your

02:15:52.660 --> 02:16:00.620
consumer that wants to play the game you know not broken ethic ethically and ethically too yeah

02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:06.620
yeah fifth dream in chat says I wonder how many other crappy ports of stuff was caused by the

02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:14.460
copy protection well in this case it seems to be most of the blame is the Capcom DRM but didn't

02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:21.620
have also sucks man how I sometimes miss the days I've turned to page 5 in the manual and type the

02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:28.820
third word on the fourth line that would be defeated I guess that doesn't anymore these days

02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:34.820
nope or the or the god what was it some of the Sierra games had the copy proof paper it was like

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:38.420
the dark red paper maybe was a Sierra I don't know but there's some company that had like the

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:47.940
I know dark red you couldn't copy it this is funny all right let's move on orange right in

02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:55.900
chat says dial-a-pirate I love dial-a-pirate all right moving on let's talk about oh I think this

02:16:55.900 --> 02:17:00.220
is actually last story we have tonight for our listener roundtable it's a story about robot

02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:07.140
wrote not roadblocks but roblox they've just formed a deal with Sony to help with some of

02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.780
the music issues now remember this was a thing that was starting to sneak up on on roblox was

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:17.540
how they were getting dragged off over all these copyright problems I'm sure it's snuck up on them

02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:23.220
they weren't totally aware of all of the rampant piracy and copyright theft on their service maybe

02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:29.780
okay the courts are sneaking up on them and the legal stuff is starting to okay so anyway now

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:35.220
they are on their way to get some music deals because of the 200 million dollar lawsuit over

02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:41.540
copyright violations so roblox has unveiled a team-up with Sony music so this will allow the

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:47.300
label artists to be on the game platform the two will collaborate in innovative music experiences

02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:53.060
apparently there's going to be a Lil Nas X concert in November can I just pause the show to

02:17:53.060 --> 02:18:01.780
have a appreciation moment for Lil Nas X I realize I realize um what he's doing is is uh very um you

02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:06.100
know it's it's causing some people to go that's a little much for television that's a little much

02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:15.700
but you know what it is fucking fascinating to me fucking fascinating to me that when Lil Nas X

02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:20.180
kisses a dude during a performance on the BET awards or whatever that was that happened was

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.780
certainly alive where that happened too I don't know but in his live performances where that is

02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:30.980
happening they will show that clip and stop it right before that moment happens and then

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:36.980
immediately run the clip from the video music awards from like 15 years ago when Madonna kissed

02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:44.260
Britney and Christina Aguilera but they don't censor that one what's the difference what's

02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:48.740
the difference one makes the straight white males uncomfortable

02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:57.460
does does Lil Nas X make you uncomfortable no I don't care I'm insane and and why not

02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:03.460
I think he's super cute I and why does Lil Nas X not make you uncomfortable this is and this I'm

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:08.340
not interrogating you I I think you actually are a model you're a model heterosexual I want other

02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:15.540
heterosexuals to hear this what why are you not bothered by Lil Nas X who cares who he's kissing

02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:23.460
he's not kissing me I don't care that's a TV oh my god a lot what a logical conclusion Loki that

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:29.620
is very you're right you're right it doesn't affect you you're right it's amazing outstanding

02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:34.980
it's like I seriously think like some of the like mindset people have about this like stupid people

02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:41.060
let's be clear it's absolute stupid people it's just like oh my god if I watch this I'm gonna be

02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:47.460
gay you know like it's it's stupid people I'm sorry and there's a lot of stupid people in this

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:53.380
country unfortunately and around the world yeah you want to know what makes you gay mass effect

02:19:54.980 --> 02:20:02.980
kidding so look I just but I will say all that I I think Lil Nas X like the way he's responding

02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:08.180
to his critics is on point and I wish there was somebody like him that I had when I was younger

02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:15.220
because when I was younger all we had was Madonna and that's why Madonna is such a gay icon for

02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:23.860
people around my age is because she was the person that was basically like I'm gonna you know do this

02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:29.060
stuff and be unapologetic I'm gonna be unapologetically me whether you like it or not

02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:35.780
mm-hmm so anyway sorry little bit I didn't mean for a Roblox story to get me on this tangent

02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:42.420
but here we are it is a well are all right that's what we do that's true I'm gonna go on a tangent

02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:48.180
so my kids or my my son's actually taking the class a coding class for Roblox this week which

02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:54.260
is kind of fun these are excited about that but they've been knee deep in uh Brookhaven which is

02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:58.420
a game on Roblox and tell me about all the lore and stuff that happens it's like some

02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:05.700
roleplay game thing where you get to pretend to be like rich people or kids or I don't know

02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:11.940
something hmm now I know who Lil Nas X is and that's who's doing the concert in Roblox in

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:18.180
November I do not know who Zara Larsson is can a young person explain this to me who is who's

02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:25.620
Zari Larsson that is a they are getting a launch party in May whoever that is sorry um I'm getting

02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:30.500
to that age y'all I need do we have some 20-somethings out there in the audience can

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:36.660
somebody explain to me who is that who should now I feel like I'm the Dionne Warwick talk show and

02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:42.180
I'm inviting the guest on who are you and why should I care about you like what have you seen

02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:47.460
that sketch of Saturday Night Live because that's like my favorite thing anyway uh oh see see the

02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:55.300
chat is already lighting up I don't know who this is I'm sorry she's a Swedish pop icon oh no wonder

02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:58.100
no wonder my comment just rubbed you the wrong way

02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:09.700
let's see bonds 006 says Rob we need a younger audience to connect with uh I guess I just can't

02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:15.540
listen to all of the music in the world like sorry especially pop music I'm not listening to any of

02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:21.540
that but if it's Swedish I'll honestly if it's Swedish pop I will probably there's a larger

02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:26.820
chance I'll probably like it like to be to be fair and you know what there was there was a date so

02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:31.380
there Carlos there was a date and time when I didn't know who Carly Rae Jepsen was

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:36.260
but then I had it explained to me and I listened to some of the songs I was like oh

02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:41.780
yes queen go off sis I guess all of that

02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:50.260
so maybe I'll do this she won she won one of the Got Talent shows oh did she uh okay okay

02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:55.220
all right um moving on let's see what else I want to see about the Roblox store this really wasn't

02:22:55.220 --> 02:23:03.060
supposed to be old man yells at cloud but here we are he said it not me and I'm older uh they

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:09.380
you do but you're you're young you're young at heart and hip anyway um yes this is not yeah

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:17.540
along with my broken hip I'm uh this is not the first deal Roblox is made there was a deal with

02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:23.300
bmg and warner as well uh so universal is the only big label that hasn't signed an agreement

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:30.100
yet so this could bode well for Roblox um why doesn't like youtube do something like this or

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:40.900
why doesn't twitch yeah I think that would be great there you go um Carlos says Rob you'll

02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:45.860
like it I need to get you on the Nordic pop queens um I already listened to Robin what else do I need

02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:47.220
really

02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:54.500
I love Robin all right excuse me I'll keep dancing on my own and like it

02:23:56.340 --> 02:24:01.300
actually and legit um before the pandemic actually it was probably about a year before the pandemic

02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:07.380
I saw Robin live in Oakland on the tour for her latest album that is not Swedish that is legit

02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:14.820
one of the who said she's Irish and it's not Swedish no bonds 006 is

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:20.820
listening like pop music I'm like uh no that's she's she's Irish

02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:28.820
Carlos uh says I mean Robin was your era since she started glowing up in the 90s

02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:34.420
was that shade was that do we need the shade button was that shade I don't think it was

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:39.620
intended shade it was more like a passing cloud I don't read it as such it's fine

02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:45.940
it was a little bit of fog rolling in that's fine no one special 77 says

02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:52.580
Roxette and ace of base yo now we're fucking talking now we're fucking talking Roxette

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:59.780
that was my era that oh and mine too there's plenty to go around share you know it was funny

02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:09.060
those like Roxette and ace of base were my guilty pleasures because I was still like radio head

02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:16.820
Pearl Jam you know Soundgarden all of the stuff that came out of the grunge revolution and then

02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:22.820
I was also listening to Ace of Base I'm living proof you can have one foot in goth industrial

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:28.180
and you can have the other foot in DDR music okay I'm living proof there's nothing wrong with it

02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:40.020
well and also like like mid-90s j-pop um Carlos and chat says if I recall correctly members of

02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:46.420
Ace of Base are problematic now yeah some things happen one of them had a problematic past yeah

02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:52.580
I'm trying to just uh remember what I remember in the 90s so that's uh that's how I look at that

02:25:53.460 --> 02:26:00.180
um and then um well it's like I own some jeffree star makeup that I bought before I knew what a

02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:04.660
piece of shit he was I'm not selling it because it was expensive I'm not throwing it away because

02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:09.140
I paid money for it but I'm not gonna buy anymore I'm just gonna transition this to listener

02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:13.780
roundtable because that's essentially what we're doing right now uh we have other comments in

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:21.540
chat bonds 006 says Soundgarden Radiohead P.O.D. Chevelle Rob Zombie Tattoo I stopped now that is

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:30.180
okay like like at least half of those I at least own one album by them for sure um let's see um

02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:39.940
uh moving on uh shad star six in chat saying the new world ends with you has this goth synth pop

02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:44.900
song and it's one of my favorites from the demo that okay but speaking of like goth and

02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:50.660
synth pop coming together that's why I love echo image so much that's what that band is

02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:56.420
echo a different drum was kind of a goth label like I guess I know a lot of synth pop it was

02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:01.860
it would that blend was like that so I that's why they're one of my favorites

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:11.940
I mean and there is goth synthwave I mean the whole uh uh retro new wave movement which is

02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:18.980
kind of like sort of my thing right now there's a lot of crossover into like the goth uh uh

02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:27.780
I'd say uh what's the word I'm thinking of like the umbrella of goth yeah it branches out to so

02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.260
many different things I mean because you have your old industrial I mean

02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:41.380
it it's always been married absolutely that's what the cure is to me the cure is

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:47.460
I'm thinking really like they're not you're probably the synth pop I know you're talking

02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:52.820
more like a epoxy berserk and things like that and um the other one okay so before we did olr

02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:57.140
um I used to go to goth club all the time no I've told this story before that was my Sunday night

02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:02.180
was goth nights at the rage which is doesn't even there anymore I went to the other one this is

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:07.860
funny but yeah in midtown but I remember the asylum was what they called it asylum always

02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:12.340
closed out every night the lat one of the last songs they would play was wilsham once in a

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:21.540
lifetime that you remember that that's where my bachelorette party ended up oh yeah yeah yeah

02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:29.140
at asylum uh-huh that was my bachelorette party yeah but there was um they got the

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:35.380
dj to play echo image right when yeah I remember that I think that was Jessica that did that too

02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:40.420
got the dj to play echo image like and and um the guy actually liked it and put it in his rotation

02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:43.780
for a couple months which I thought was yeah it just that was right around the time a ddr

02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:50.500
ultra mix 2 came out so yeah it's awesome oh love that um let's see uh fifth dream says I

02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:56.740
miss goth night but the pandemic puts so many goth nights on twitch um bonds 006 says no love

02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:02.980
for grunge music no I just I didn't maybe follow it as much yeah no just say that I did yeah um

02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:09.780
I don't I probably didn't listen to as much of it but you kind of you you listen to it I don't

02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:14.340
know when I was growing up in the 90s I was doing a little bit of everything honestly you know you

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:23.380
go to my collection and you would see things like like pm dawn and radio head elanis uh just any

02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:28.980
anything and everything anyhow um let's see

02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:37.460
um by the way shane help us answer an earlier question in the show uh the oled switch somebody

02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:41.620
asked if you like were gonna fight people to pre-order it and I was kind of like I think

02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:46.500
shane is gonna get it but he had to kind of talk himself into it a little bit he wasn't like

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:50.020
oh my god I gotta get one right away after seeing the trailer

02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:58.580
um fifth dream says stone temple pilots pj ten oh I thought you were gonna say pj harvey

02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:04.340
now that was up my alley in the 90s so you know my other 90s group though that I was like way into

02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:11.540
and still am um luscious jackson oh I love luscious jackson heck yeah well I mean like my

02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:18.340
two like personal theme songs I'd say from them is uh lady fingers and daughters of the chaos

02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:26.740
uh such a such a good group um fifth dream said nick cave fuck yes cave oh my god that

02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:33.060
nick and the duet he did with kylie yes so actually oh legit though my favorite

02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:38.660
nick cave song is the ship song which is like a slow bow I love that song anyway all right

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:46.660
you know you know who I always had like this mental impression of the most interesting duet

02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:53.300
ever would have been leonard cohen and nick cave could you just imagine surprised that

02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:59.220
ever happened yeah um okay now lady fingers does like my personal theme song just to tell

02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:04.820
shad stars like that um and shane's in chat and wants to say I will be getting it the oled switch

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:09.060
yes I went back and forth because it's only a screen upgrade but then I realized I barely play

02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:12.900
it docked so there was so okay so I didn't mischaracterize that there was a little back

02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:17.380
and forth he didn't just say oh I'm getting it because it's new and shiny uh he had to

02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:23.060
talk himself into it a little bit all right anyway uh moving on uh I was gonna get to our email I

02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:27.540
don't think we have any tonight we don't have any let me shout let me shout it out anyway participate

02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:32.260
at orange lounge radio.com but sadly there are no emails to read tonight but maybe we'll get some in

02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:38.500
the future that means I get to have a quick drag race tangent because I'm watching all star six

02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:45.060
I'm actually watching it I need to buy it is it any good um buy it oh oh yeah because you that's

02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:50.420
right you download by episode I have paramount plus but um actually yes because give me your

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:57.060
login okay I will just remind me and I will um the thing I like about it is that it's not

02:31:57.620 --> 02:32:02.100
like what I was really starting to get turned off with with drag race was it was just drama drama

02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:07.140
drama drama manufactured drama and all star six is surprising considering this is a cast that has

02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:12.020
eureka silky nutmeg ganache and some of the queens that are kind of known for that stuff

02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:18.980
like honestly redemption is a very strong theme this season and people like silky nutmeg ganache

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:22.820
know exactly how they were received by the public and they are doing everything they can to change

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:29.540
it does she still draw her brows on with a sharpie um I just I just prefer to talk about the milk and

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:36.180
cookies in her titties but anyway that is okay that is uh that that's that's my quick tangent

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:40.180
on drag race is that I'm actually enjoying all star six and what's really surprised me is some

02:32:40.180 --> 02:32:44.980
of the queens that are doing well were not the ones I was expecting to so it's very very

02:32:44.980 --> 02:32:50.740
interesting yeah this is a very redemption based season so message me and I'll I'll do a little

02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:55.940
marathon um yeah you you just you I'll call you later but you have to you have to because you're

02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:59.140
going to probably stream after the show tonight so I'll probably do it tomorrow yeah but you have

02:32:59.140 --> 02:33:03.220
to go and log in and then you get an activation code and then I put in the code that's how got

02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:08.660
you yeah all right cool all right I'll uh I'll tell Dan we'll get that set up okay cool yeah I

02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:12.820
don't care just watch whatever you want I just uh don't do it on Thursdays when they release them

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:17.780
because that's when I watch them but okay I think we're the only other person I'm sharing with is

02:33:17.780 --> 02:33:23.140
only on it for Star Trek so I don't think that's a problem right now so I want to watch that too so

02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:30.740
binge away have fun all right all right anyway uh let's move on um oh I there was a big old

02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:34.820
question here from no one special I want to make sure I get that here no one special always tries

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:39.540
to come up with a good question for the listener round table and I think I skimmed it ah yes okay

02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:44.260
so this is about video game movies uh no one special says as you all know video game movies

02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:48.100
are nothing new and have been around for ages they run the gamut from terrible see the blood

02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:52.980
rain movies well just honestly anything with ue bowl right uh to fairly good the silent hill

02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:57.540
movies and have been in multiple genres documentaries fictional stories etc all that

02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:02.820
being said is there any video game movie that stands out for you that you particularly enjoy

02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:07.700
even if it may be an unpopular choice for me I especially love the first two final

02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:15.300
fantasy movies and the king of arcades so video game movies you uh enjoyed even if the masses

02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:20.020
didn't see I would I love silent hill that's what I'd say is silent hill the masses didn't

02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:25.220
really like that movie I liked the first resident evil that really had nothing to do with it

02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:31.780
yeah to me yeah um I am so jazzed see now now it's interesting because it's not just movies

02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:38.500
now it's going to be tv shows because again we have the witcher which okay yeah book you know

02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:44.900
whatever it's kind of on the line um but I could I even I wonder if I could answer this question

02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:50.420
with something like because you said um Mortal Kombat the very first one well I was gonna say

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:56.180
what about something like stranger things I know that isn't rooted in gaming but I'll be damned if

02:34:56.180 --> 02:35:00.900
that show doesn't feel like a video game plot and kind of tickle a lot of the same like retro stuff

02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:08.580
that video games kind of do for me I don't know oh I also like to warcraft oh SSJ100 Matt says

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:12.660
Scott Pilgrim while not a gaming movie per se didn't get the props it should have at the box

02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:18.980
office I'm gonna I had a lot of fun we did a um a cult hosting of that um right before the pandemic

02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:23.860
no I mean it was about a year before um but we I remember hosting it in a double feature with

02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:30.900
Kung Fury here locally and that was a lot of fun that showing was a ton of fun and to get to watch

02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:36.020
Scott Pilgrim with other nerds and stuff that enjoy the movie that was a lot of fun Shane

02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:40.500
actually went to that I guess that was a while ago because Shane was actually here so uh it must

02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:46.020
have been several years ago I'm just losing track of time um but yeah that was uh that was a lot of

02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:51.700
fun to host that one um there's also all of the Pokemon movies but those are a little bit more

02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:58.820
related to the anime Carlos said Detective Pikachu though which I I think that's a good choice that

02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:03.780
was a good movie I like that so yeah I feel like the gaming but now now we're going to be talking

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.900
about gaming tv shows too I can't wait for that Final Fantasy 14 show I'm gonna I'm gonna eat that

02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:13.140
up whenever that comes out I mean I know that's been slowed down because the pandemic um you know

02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:17.380
I did also kind of like House of the Dead but only kind of liked it it was more like I need

02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:23.140
something completely mindless and violent to watch it's okay to like things in a cheesy kind of way

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:31.060
too yeah well I mean I love Xanadu so whatever um oh Bobby Blackwood legacy is not a video game

02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:36.660
movie but but I get it I get it and I I think that is an answer that would qualify because

02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:42.260
no it's not directly a video game movie but it did kind of spawn the video games like especially

02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:47.380
the early the Tron from the 80s especially you know spawned the the actual arcade machine discs

02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:52.500
of Tron and I think it was more about like arcade culture was definitely like a part of that so I

02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:58.500
I would I would count Tron legacy um but Bobby Blackwolf I like this move answer too not a video

02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:02.500
game movie but looks like a video game if someone asks me what's your favorite movie that most

02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:08.180
people hate or never give a chance it's Speed Racer I feel like that's that game that movie

02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:13.940
was great it's actually well it's also a game too but um yeah the movie was amazing that's

02:37:13.940 --> 02:37:20.420
one of those movies I feel like time is being very kind too and like a lot of people like I

02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:25.700
hear more about that movie now and people looking back on that fondly than I did when the movie came

02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:31.700
out you know how like there's a lot of movies that end up aging pretty well and then people kind of

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:36.420
look back on it more fondly than when it was originally out it's definitely one of those so

02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:43.860
love that all right um I think that's it for uh the the movie chat and the the round table stuff

02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:47.780
let's check in to see if there's any last minute stories and then we'll close up shop tonight I'm

02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:51.300
sorry I didn't go to discord tonight but we are running we're almost to nine o'clock so I want

02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:55.380
to make sure we kind of wrap up here in the coming moments so let me go to the last minute stories

02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:59.220
oh I will shout out the discord though because I do read it and I know I pulled some stories

02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:04.500
for tonight from it so vog network.com discord I enjoy seeing the chatter and the story suggestions

02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:11.060
throughout the week um Loki do you have any last minute stories not really I mean there's um a

02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:18.340
rumor of a game was it a fighting game based off of Nicktoons that I think they've already had an

02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:24.500
ios and android version of that's being ported to the switch in October so that's it all right

02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:30.340
well then we will go around and get everybody's final thoughts um yeah tiger claws saying the

02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:36.900
movie was directed by the directors of the the matrix um so uh yeah the Wachowskis uh and that is

02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:45.380
uh are are they both doing the new matrix movie or just they are I think so I think it might be just

02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:51.460
Lana that's doing the matrix I don't know but they're um but yeah um I'm I'm I'm gonna sound

02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:56.180
like Loki here but I really want to see that new matrix movie me too it looks like it's gonna be

02:38:56.180 --> 02:39:03.380
awesome they have now amazing yeah and plus I loved Sensei I need to actually I only got like

02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:07.860
halfway through the second season I just was bad timing for me I need to go back and finish that

02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:13.460
because that was uh that was an awesome show and that was the Wachowskis as well so awesome all

02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:19.140
right and Bobby Blackwolf confirms it's just Lana so I I don't know but it's other projects or

02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:25.940
something going on all right um anyhow let's wrap it up with final thoughts and then we will uh

02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:31.140
be out of here for tonight but I believe dark soccer is doing some uh some some dead by daylight

02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:48.020

02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:00.180

02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:21.300
opinions a little bit and just get more words out there and and bring more people into this

02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:27.380
crazy family we formed here on sunday nights over the last 19 plus years um I also want to

02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:41.220
some olr specific shirts um so uh and a pretty cool new vog network logo logo that's a very

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:47.540
retro inspired so dark soccer good job vog network.com slash shop if you want to go shopping

02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:52.740
and check out some of the merch there um thank you thank you again a nice five-star review on

02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:57.780
a site like itunes or wherever it is you found this podcast um spotify google play or whatever

02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:03.700
um thank you thank you and uh you share uh auto hosts on uh twitch they go a long way as well so

02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:08.500
thank you to everybody who helps us out with all of that um now I think I'll go to final thoughts

02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:12.740
now that I said that that mandatory part that we always have to say um because it's fully good

02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:19.460
information so dark soccer what is your final thought tonight um uh I'm gonna I might play

02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:27.860
pyramid head for the first time so I need help um my advice is don't overdo the trail but remember

02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:34.420
that trail will help you out like crazy in chases so chase where palette or uh use the trail where

02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:41.060
pallets used to be use the uh trail by windows I do it little blips by the um places that because

02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:44.980
then they act more if you leave a big old line survivors will see it and they'll duck under it

02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:48.980
but if you leave little blips it'll function more like trapper traps and you're more likely to hit

02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:55.140
people with it um and then the other but I found that that was that other move that's the projectile

02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:59.460
kind of attack I found that goes through walls the laser yes laser beam I don't know the real name

02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:05.940
laser beam is great but don't rely on it I in my opinion the laser here's where the laser beam is

02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:11.220
going to be the best um if you know and you you've played enough killer now dark soccer you know

02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:16.180
when a survivor is about to palette you right pretty much you will be shocked at how many

02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:21.300
survivors forget the pyramid head has a laser beam so when you know you're about to get palleted

02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:25.700
hold the right mouse button to start drawing your lines and as soon as they throw the palette down

02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:30.580
do your laser and you'll hit them every single time that sounds delightful I might enjoy him

02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:35.780
I enjoyed Freddie more than I thought I would Freddie's a lot of fun so yeah anyway all right

02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:41.380
um so okay well have a did I get your final thought I don't oh that was my final thought

02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:45.540
I'm gonna I might play pyramid head and I need help I could I didn't know if it was just another

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:49.700
tangent or a final thought I couldn't remember sorry all right have a great story and but I am

02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:54.420
going to gracefully see myself out for now I will not be on cam tonight just because these bright

02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:58.980
lights are giving me a fucking headache all right sorry for the migraine all right feel better

02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:03.780
hey no I am I don't have a migraine I'm just like they're they're finally starting to get to my eyes

02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:08.420
so that's okay all right uh all right so Loki we'll go to you and your final thought

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:13.860
um hopefully I'll get a new video out this week like I said the

02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:20.500
build I'm doing is pretty large so look for that hopefully this week all right um my final thought

02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:26.020
um I don't usually talk about this type of stuff on the show but I had some really good news this

02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:32.100
past week um at my day job so um really really good stuff and I'm just very thankful and um the

02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:37.940
I've had a lot of good news lately and uh fingers crossed it keeps coming and I don't get walloped

02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:44.500
with bad news um but uh yeah just thanks to everybody who has uh supported me not just here

02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:48.900

02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:10.500
not vaccinated please consider getting the vaccine please read up on the facts about the vaccine and

02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:13.460
not a lot of the myths that are out there on the internet because the more people that get

02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:17.220
vaccinated the less chance these other things are going to spread around and the more chance we can

02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:21.620
get back to doing all this normal stuff that we're used to doing so please please consider doing that

02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:26.740
