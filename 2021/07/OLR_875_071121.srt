1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
We're back and we're bringing you news from around the game universe while we bake

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
in the 2021 heat dome.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,280
Cooking in the oven we have some evergreen stories of cheating, piracy, piracy being

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,000
better than the official release and the unsurprising news that a Pokemon game nets billions of

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,640
dollars during its existence.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Also there's more Assassin's Creed coming, you get such a clock to news about that in

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Call of Duty.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,280
This is the non-exhaustive list of stories we're set to cover tonight and now it's time

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,560
for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Logie to provide you with the details

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,160
of these and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:47,520
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,200
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back after a little break for the holiday last

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,120
week once again, live with episode number 875 of our show for tonight, July the 11th

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
of 2021.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,960
It has been a heck of a week.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,760
We'll talk all about that in just a moment, but first let me say hello.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,000
I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
Hi, how are you?

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,160
I have decided to be natural today.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Yes.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
So that...

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,040
I was just saying, you're going the natural makeup free, but you have an upgraded camera

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,600
thing going on for those watching on Twitch, because I have to say this every week, we

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,920
do tape live every Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network,

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,720
the voice of geeks network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,800
Shout out to Bobby Black Wolf for an excellent job hosting that SGDQ, Summer Games Done Quick

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,040
finale last night.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,940
We'll talk more about that in a little bit.

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,700
Shout out to the raid we just got as well before we went live tonight.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Thank you for that.

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,940
He who is Steve, allegedly, supposedly Steve, if that is Steve's real name.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
No, thank you very much for the raid.

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Anyway, I was just saying your camera is all nice and fancy.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,580
Well, I was using like this knockoff GoPro looking thing.

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,980
You ordered it off Wish.

39
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Just say it.

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,280
You ordered it off Wish.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,460
I didn't order it off Wish, I ordered it on AliExpress.

42
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,540
I thought it might be Wish.

43
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Which is only a step up.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:25,700
But I was doing some research and I was looking at getting a Logitech Brio, lots of money,

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
right?

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,740
And then I thought about it.

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,140
It works so good.

48
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,860
Loki, you be quiet till I introduce you.

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,060
That's my turn.

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:45,140
So what I ended up doing is I was looking at reviews of cameras and people were actually

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,180
showing about using your iPhone as a camera.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,460
And I was like, why I have an iPhone?

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,620
Why I have a Mac?

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,300
And I can tell you that, first of all, I have two different apps that I'm using and one

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,500
of them I use for OBS that has an even higher resolution and even less latency.

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,380
The one I have to use for this, and this is just like the free version.

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,580
So it's only 720p, but it looks great.

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:26,420
The iPhone camera is miles above any on the market capture device short of using a professional

59
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,820
4K camera with a conversion.

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,900
And this is basically the equivalent of doing it.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,540
So I have this rig set up that has my phone on it.

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,500
And right now I'm running through camo, which again, all the reviews of using an iPhone

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,340
versus a Logitech Brio, this blows the Brio out of the water.

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,600
So I've got my apps all set up.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,380
You don't need an IP for the record.

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:00,740
There's an OBS, iPhone for OBS app that does it natively for OBS.

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,140
So you don't need to have an IP or an address or anything like that.

68
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,940
You just straight up hook up, install the link plugin and you're set.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,220
The same with camo.

70
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,700
It works the same way.

71
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:21,140
I am incredibly happy with it and well, I can charge my phone and do stuff at the same

72
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
time.

73
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,100
So yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,300
Depending on how this goes, I may actually pay for this one.

75
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,980
You know, I'm going to have to re-listen to this and take notes seriously or try to

76
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,460
get some links from you for some of this, because this is really good for the whole

77
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,260
discussion about, you know, anybody can have a Twitch channel or anybody can have a YouTube.

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,060
Anybody can do a podcast.

79
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,660
You know, we want to get more voices out there.

80
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,400
We want to get, you know, a lot of diversity and a lot of different people out there.

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,580
And a lot of folks think they have to buy this big, fancy technical equipment to get

82
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,640
started.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,900
And it turns out, you can probably just use your phone.

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,460
I mean, you might have to pay a small fee for, you know, the converter thing or whatever,

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,660
but that's pretty awesome.

86
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,140
Well, and the thing is just to point out something that Tiger Claw is saying is to use like an

87
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
IP one.

88
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
No, don't use an IP.

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Anything that uses an IP.

90
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,300
Use something that's going to use plugins and your USB cable.

91
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,020
You will get far less latency that way.

92
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,540
Oh, good to know.

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
All right.

94
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
Yeah.

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
And usually a higher image quality.

96
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,040
Before I go to Loki, how did you, did you have a good week off?

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I think you were here streaming that night, right?

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I don't remember.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,000
The 4th of July we had off here at O.L.R. because the holiday in the States at my normal

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
time.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Gotcha.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OK.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We went swimming.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OK.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Nice.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Nice.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I spent I spent the day up in the.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
So for those of you that remember an old, old show, I used to host here on Vaga called

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Horde House.

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,440
It was about like Warcraft and other online games.

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,000
So or if you ever heard Starboard Power Coupling, that was Captain Matt or Grandpa Matt, depending

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,880
what show it was, his show.

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,040
And he has a cabin out in the woods literally now.

115
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,440
So he has a cabin out in the woods.

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
And so he invited us up for the fourth.

117
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,440
And it was great because you know what?

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,320
No fireworks because they are all banned up there because that is primo.

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,360
You know, unfortunately, forest fire territory.

120
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
So fireworks are huge.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
No, no.

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
It was so quiet and so peaceful.

123
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,520
I had a great fourth.

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Lovely.

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,560
Anyway, high tech master Loki, how are you?

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,020
You could get around that band by just saying that you're doing a gender reveal and then

127
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
it's OK.

128
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,220
No, that's even worse.

129
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,740
Those stupid parties have even more disaster than anything else.

130
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,580
It's just, oh, my gosh, ridiculous anyway.

131
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
How was your holiday?

132
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,580
How was your break?

133
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,580
It was fine.

134
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,820
We just went over to my mom's house because my niece is born on the Fourth of July.

135
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,140
So it was her birthday as well.

136
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,540
So we went over there, just did pizza and lit up some fireworks.

137
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,060
Nice.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,020
Sounds like you had a nice, nice little break.

139
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
How's that?

140
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,060
How's the YouTube channel going?

141
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,460
You posted another video in the past few days, right?

142
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm not.

143
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,220
Well, I posted one last week, I think.

144
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,500
It's been a struggle because we've been having weird server issue things.

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,100
Also, the build I'm doing right now is very big.

146
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,660
And so it's taken a long time to get to the point where I can do a time lapse and actually

147
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
build it.

148
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm finished with the design stuff right now because I'm finishing what I started with

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Tango, kind of the build inspired by that.

150
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,640
It's enormous.

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,840
So I've been just kind of working to get there and we just updated the 117.1.

152
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,680
So with that came other things that are breaking.

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,460
So I got stuff to work, though, finally, but it's just been a little bit of a struggle.

154
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
All right.

155
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah, I did release a video, I think, last week.

156
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,760
I wanted to release one this week.

157
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,920
I will try to get it out as early as I can.

158
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,040
We've had people leave the server as well, and they've gone to other SMP servers, which

159
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,200
looked pretty fun.

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,520
But I'm sticking with this one until the end of the season.

161
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
So we'll see what happens.

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
All right.

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Sounds good.

164
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
So we're going to get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

165
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,040
But first, I thought I'd kind of reintroduce the show since we were off last week.

166
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
It's been a little while since I've done a little reintroduction.

167
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,640
And we got that nice little raid here at the top of the show tonight between Bobby's

168
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,480
show going off air and us coming on air.

169
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
So hi.

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Hi.

171
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
That's our intro.

172
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Hi.

173
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,920
We're Orange Lawns Radio, and we have just entered our 20th year of internet broadcasting,

174
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
if you can believe it.

175
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,000
We celebrated our 19th birthday, that was our last live episode two weeks ago.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
So we've been doing this show for a long time.

177
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,640
We all met as frenzies playing Dance Dance Revolution and other music games at the arcade.

178
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
That's how we met.

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Which is great.

180
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,520
So to kind of talk a little bit about Summer Games Done Quick a little bit, which our pal

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Bobby was involved with, they had a really cute run of some music games that they did.

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
And they were doing Dance Rush Stardom, which is what they do online.

183
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,160
That's the new one they do, which has no...

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,800
It's funny because that's what we used to talk about back in the day was, imagine if

185
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,420
it was just one giant pad and it could reach...

186
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,800
That's literally what Dance Rush Stardom is, but it was really cute because they got the

187
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
whole community involved at the end.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,240
And I was like, oh, that is something we would have done back in the day.

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
It's adorable.

190
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
So anyway, that's the whole...

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,800
Those music games have been around forever and that's where we were all kind of born

192
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,820
out of.

193
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,720
We did a show on Live 365 for a long time and then time passes and for us, there was

194
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,800
a long break in music games between the last DDR they really did and then the rock band.

195
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
So kind of in that interim, we decided we're going to talk about all video games and make

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,220
our show about all types of games.

197
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,880
And that's where we've been at ever since.

198
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
It's been a very long time.

199
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,280
So we were live on Shoutcast for a long time and we made the switch to Twitch about two

200
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,360
years ago and it's been working great.

201
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,880
We get to meet a lot more people, you get to see our faces for better or for worse.

202
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
But remember, we are recording a podcast.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
So sometimes our video interactions are a little bit minimal because we have had this

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,400
podcast pretty much before iTunes launched podcasting, so a very, very long time.

205
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,720
So we mainly do this for the folks listening on the podcast feed.

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
But of course, we love the folks that join us live on Sunday nights as well.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know what, Rob?

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,360
I'll just say real quick, Orange Wright shared that clip from episode one where we predicted

210
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Dance Rush.

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Sorry.

212
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Yes.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes, Jamie.

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,640
So I was thinking that when I submitted us for a Guinness World Record, I said longest

215
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,840
running internet video game show.

216
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeah.

217
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,240
I should have actually said longest running video game show.

218
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,280
Because yeah, I don't know what on TV or traditional radio would be longer.

219
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, I mean, really just any sort of video game program.

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can't think of...

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
You know, non-print.

223
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,240
We've outlasted and gone longer than just about anything that's been on TV.

224
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, Bobby says Electric Playground still exists.

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,060
They started in the 90s in Canada and they're still on today.

226
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,820
No big break because I wouldn't count X-Play because there's going to be a big break there

227
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,060
between all that.

228
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
But if that's...

229
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Then it is what it is.

230
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
When are they coming back?

231
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,580
They keep talking about G-Force coming back, G-Force coming back.

232
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
When?

233
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,060
When is that happening?

234
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,140
Because I hear all the hype about it's coming back, but I don't see it coming back.

235
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,780
To be clear, I know they are different shows, I'm aware.

236
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,540
But I'm just saying, I was using X-Play as an example.

237
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,460
They are at a big break and so that wouldn't count.

238
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
So anyway.

239
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,740
Yeah, because they did like a thing back in Thanksgiving.

240
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,780
That was like eight months ago.

241
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,300
Where is G-Force?

242
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
It's still...

243
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,020
Well, back to the Guinness World Record.

244
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,340
Yes, please.

245
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm glad that I submitted it in the category that I did because it is a first.

246
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,320
And I'm feeling very confident that we're going to get it.

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
That's exciting.

248
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Very, very confident.

249
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
That's exciting.

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,200
So I don't think we're going to get it because everything goes...

251
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,760
Everything is unfortunately bad for me.

252
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,920
So I'm going to expect we don't get it.

253
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm just bringing the whole show down.

254
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,720
Who says I'm doing it for you?

255
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm doing it for me.

256
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
It's just by association.

257
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Have you ever seen the movie The Cooler?

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,760
Yeah, I'm the cooler, but just in the sense of like reality and yeah.

259
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
And I'm an apothesis.

260
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,940
So my thought is, eh.

261
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Don't you dare.

262
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I don't need this.

263
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
No, it'll be awesome.

264
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
It'll be awesome.

265
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
All right.

266
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Yeah.

267
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,540
Let's get into it before we get accused of not ever talking about video games.

268
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,260
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and talk about a big story that's going around

269
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,940
the gaming world this week.

270
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,180
And that is Nintendo unveiled a new Switch.

271
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,180
Switch Pro!

272
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Wait.

273
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Yawn.

274
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Yawn.

275
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Gotcha.

276
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Okay, so...

277
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Major yawn.

278
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:07,020
The thing is that I don't want to say I told you so, but we set our expectations, not we,

279
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,020
but you.

280
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm saying we to be nice.

281
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,820
Set your expectations a little high.

282
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
By we, we mean you.

283
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
Yeah, by we, we mean you.

284
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,180
I had no expectations, so they've met none of that.

285
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,300
This is a relationship.

286
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,660
When I say it's not you, it's me.

287
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,580
It's actually you.

288
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,540
The problem is y'all set your expectations too high on social media for that Switch Pro

289
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,860
because Bloomberg and all these other clickbait sites that exist to generate revenue based

290
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
off clicks.

291
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,860
I don't want to say they lied.

292
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,900
I actually don't think they lied.

293
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:44,900
But they hyped up some rumors and whispers and things written on bathroom stalls that

294
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,300
perhaps were not ready for prime time just yet.

295
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,740
So we found out we are getting a new Switch.

296
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,140
So let's talk about what we are getting.

297
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,700
It's an OLED model.

298
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,900
So in a nutshell, it's going to be a different handheld unit.

299
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
It will be a seven inch handheld with the OLED screen.

300
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,660
That's going to be the biggest change.

301
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,260
So basically it's going to look more like a PlayStation Vita because I think the Vita

302
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,860
used OLED, if I'm not mistaken.

303
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Right.

304
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
That's a gorgeous screen.

305
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,300
Like that's that's the reason to still play again.

306
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,720
Final Fantasy four.

307
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,380
My favorite to play it on is the Vita, the PSP version on the Vita.

308
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,060
That is my favorite way to play that game.

309
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,300
And these new little remakes they're doing.

310
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,660
I know we're not going to be as good.

311
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,340
So anyway, there's also going to be a wired LAN port in the dock, if that's a thing that's

312
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
of interest to you.

313
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,940
And oh, a boost in internal storage to 64 gigabytes.

314
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,500
That we're getting there.

315
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,740
That will all be coming out the same day as Metroid Dread.

316
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,780
That's October the 8th.

317
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,880
And it's going to set you back three hundred and fifty dollars for the system.

318
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,100
Now look, if I were to play most of my time in handheld, I'd probably think this is pretty

319
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
cool.

320
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,080
I might consider getting one, although since I already have a Switch, I'm not sure I'm

321
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,380
really into it.

322
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,000
But this is going to be great for people who, for whatever reason, still haven't got on

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,020
board with the Switch yet.

324
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,140
This is going to be a sweet upgrade for those folks, I think.

325
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,980
But you know, for folks like me who play 95 percent of the time in docked mode, there's

326
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,180
really nothing here.

327
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,580
I mean, one could argue maybe the wired LAN.

328
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,980
You can you can you can get that like as an accessory or whatever.

329
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,940
You can find it separately, too.

330
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Yeah, exactly.

331
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:31,600
So the biggest surprise in that is that it's not a 4K system and it's not a pro.

332
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,180
It's not a buffed up system.

333
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,860
It's not going to get you more frames on Breath of the Wild or Breath of the Wild 2.

334
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,800
I kind of think, you know, and I said this before a few shows ago, I kind of think what

335
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,820
happened here is that I said this when Nintendo didn't announce anything leading up to E3

336
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,340
and then they came out and said their E3 presentation was specifically they specifically

337
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,680
said software only, no hardware, and then they kind of lied because they had that Zelda

338
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Game and Watch.

339
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,220
But we'll let that one slide.

340
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,420
They very clearly made it known there's not going to be any Switch announcements.

341
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,260
And that was the point where I think I was saying and to be fair, other people, too,

342
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,580
were saying, you know what?

343
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,780
This chip shortage that's going on in the world right now, you you still can't get a

344
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,900
fucking PlayStation five.

345
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,420
Does Nintendo really want to get?

346
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,880
Do you want Nintendo and their hardware folks, which, oh, that can be exhausting sometimes

347
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,700
to try to find Nintendo hardware, right?

348
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,540
Do you want Nintendo to try to release a Switch Pro right now?

349
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,540
Because to be honest, with the chip shortages still going around and stuff, I kind of don't.

350
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,380
I kind of think this is great news that we're not getting a Switch Pro this year because

351
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,280
I don't want to fight people for one.

352
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,800
And I think deep down, most of you don't want to fight people for one either, as much as

353
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
you may have liked the four K and all that stuff.

354
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You know what?

355
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
Let it bake in the oven for another year.

356
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,400
Maybe we'll see something next year instead.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,280
Maybe at this point, they just say, screw it.

358
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,960
And we get a Switch two or a, you know, a real successor to the Switch console.

359
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,320
I oh, my, the Switch, you were getting in the switch.

360
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,840
I kind of think I kind of, you know, not to get too far off topic with that, but I kind

361
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,080
of think Nintendo is going to stick with the Switch for a while.

362
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,800
I think everybody's talking about what would they'll go from the Switch Pro to the next

363
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Nintendo console.

364
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,460
And I'm kind of like the next Nintendo console will be a switch of some sort.

365
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
It would.

366
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,060
They're going to keep this handheld dock thing going for a while.

367
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
It might look different.

368
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,540
It might have some radical changes, but the whole concept of switch and that that is staying.

369
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,400
I would be shocked if they went away from that.

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,800
But then again, they kind of did that with Wii U, didn't they?

371
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,880
They walked away from those motion controllers and look where that got them.

372
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,960
So I don't know.

373
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,420
Pod Culture in chat says the Super Switch.

374
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,840
I think that would be a great name for it.

375
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,640
I hope they name the successor better, whatever they do.

376
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,060
I think Super Switch is the way to go.

377
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,120
It's very clear, very plain.

378
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,800
And you know what you're going to get with something like that.

379
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,480
But anyway, I digress because that is going to be at least a year down the line at this

380
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
point.

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,300
The Super Switch is all we got this year and Nintendo is not going to do something new

382
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,040
for this holiday.

383
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,440
Let's get to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

384
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,600
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Shane wants to fight people for one.

385
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,960
Now, I'm not going to try to speak for Shane, but I do talk to him a lot.

386
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,840
I don't think he's as like I think he kind of got to the point where he's like, all right,

387
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
I'll get one.

388
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,480
But it wasn't something where he was like, oh, like when it was first revealed, he was

389
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,920
like, oh, I got to go get in line right now or I don't.

390
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,120
And Shane, if you're out there, feel free to text or chat.

391
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,360
But that was the impression I got anyway.

392
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Let's see.

393
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,840
OK, I thought that was I thought that was Shane texting me and that was actually Dark

394
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Sakura saying why she went afk.

395
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,120
I was like, wow, that was quick.

396
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Other comments in chat.

397
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,400
S2100 Matt says, to be fair, Nintendo has done well with their IPs, indie titles and

398
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,920
so forth that they don't need a Switch Pro this year or even next.

399
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,800
See, I'm kind of with you there.

400
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,560
Animal Crossing was bananas, and I think they're going to have another great holiday for the

401
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
system they've got.

402
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,900
S2100 Matt continues, a year ago, we were talking about how Animal Crossing was the

403
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,000
highest sold game of the pandemic.

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,880
That game wasn't in 4K, 120 FPS, BBQ.

405
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,400
Nintendo can strike gold again on this current hardware.

406
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
Yeah, I agree.

407
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,560
I think it would be even better if I could play Breath of the Wild in 4K.

408
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,440
But again, I don't want to fight people for that right now.

409
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,000
I still can't get a PlayStation 5 easily.

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,880
I mean, if I really wanted to work at it and really wanted to camp on websites, like, I guess I

411
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,440
could go and get a PlayStation 5.

412
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,720
But like, I don't know any other industry, maybe concert tickets where I have to beg to buy one.

413
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,200
Like, I will get a PlayStation 5 when I can walk into Target and pick one up off the shelf.

414
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,320
Although that's that's that's kind of what I did with Xbox Series X.

415
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,040
So, you know, that's why I have one of those.

416
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,400
So there is that.

417
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,960
Yeah, I'm getting so much use out of my Series X too.

418
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,360
So, yeah, I got to be honest.

419
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,840
I'm I'm loving the Series X right now for meeting the needs of this current generation.

420
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,800
That's not don't don't label Rob Roberts, Xbox fanboy.

421
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,640
No, I love all.

422
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,680
I want to see everybody succeed.

423
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm like mean girls when she's splitting up the crown and want to give everybody a piece.

424
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,640
OK, that's me with the gaming industry.

425
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,760
I want to see everybody succeed.

426
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,160
But just as it is right now, the PlayStation 5 is kind of a pain to get.

427
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,440
And I don't feel like there's anything.

428
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,800
I kind of I really did want to play Returnal.

429
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,680
I was at the first game where I was like, oh, I really need.

430
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,600
And I think once some more of these games start coming out, like Final Fantasy 16, that's

431
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,080
going to come out eventually, but not this year.

432
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,760
But if it's out next holiday, oh, I'm fucking buying a PlayStation 5 because you better

433
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,320
believe you better believe I'm playing Final Fantasy 16 when it's by the folks who did

434
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,120
14, which I think is probably the best Final Fantasy game they've made at this point.

435
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,600
It's just incredible.

436
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,040
So let's see, Pod Culture in chat says, if I could find someone willing to pay full boat

437
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,280
for my Mario Switch, I'd consider upgrading since I mainly play in handheld.

438
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,640
But otherwise, nope.

439
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,440
You might be surprised, Pod Culture.

440
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,160
People want to still buy those old hardware things.

441
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
I don't know if you've used it.

442
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,440
It might be a little harder.

443
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,600
You might not get the full value from it, but you never know.

444
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
Take a look.

445
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,880
And let's say SSG100Matt says, you have better odds winning two of those PlayStation 5s on

446
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,240
Summer Game Stunt Quick's giveaway.

447
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,440
They even joke on stream most of the staff of GDQ can't get a PS5.

448
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,760
Well, I entered because I donated at the end of the Summer Game Stunt Quick there yesterday.

449
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,440
So who knows?

450
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,040
Maybe I will be lucky enough to win one, but I'm not going to count on it.

451
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,740
Questbuster says you can also sign up using your PlayStation account on Sony site and

452
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,780
for a chance and an invite reserving your spot for you in a virtual queue.

453
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,620
I did that like a year and a half ago.

454
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Still.

455
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,820
Yeah, I remember that back in September.

456
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,940
Never got an email, so.

457
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
But it's honest.

458
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,740
Honestly, if they sent me an invite, I would just say, I don't want one right now.

459
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
I don't know.

460
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
I'm saving money.

461
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,220
I can't plunk 500 on a console right now, but maybe give it to me.

462
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,500
I don't give me $500 and sure, I'll give you a PS5.

463
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,580
I would be down for that.

464
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,140
You're going to give me $500 and I'll get you a PS5?

465
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,620
Yeah, with the $500 I give you.

466
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
OK.

467
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
Oh, yeah.

468
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,620
If I get my cordial invite.

469
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
OK.

470
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,620
All right.

471
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Yes.

472
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
We'll talk offline.

473
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
We'll talk.

474
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
All right.

475
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Questbuster says I got an invite, but they ran out.

476
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
So.

477
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Oh, my God.

478
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,420
Can you imagine getting invited to like Disneyland to ride a new ride or something and then you

479
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,180
get all the way down there and they're like, it broke.

480
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,100
So is this like the reservation for the car from Seinfeld?

481
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,780
You know, it's like I don't think you understand what a reservation means.

482
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,500
Or it's oh, oh, oh, what's the other terrible one?

483
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,740
I've never watched that show.

485
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,500
No, I can relate, though.

486
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,420
You book a seat on a flight and you don't actually have a seat on the flight.

487
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,320
And then they're like, sorry, we're bumping you because we oversold the flight.

488
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,820
It's that.

489
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,260
Gross.

490
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,300
Anyway, that's when I turn into Major Karen and raise some hell.

491
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,220
At least we have a kitty on stream now.

492
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
It's nice to see.

493
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Anyway.

494
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,020
It was staring me down.

495
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,580
Any anyone here on the hosting panel considering a Nintendo OLED switch?

496
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
No.

497
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
OK.

498
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
No.

499
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,140
Unless the kids break mine, which is a distinct possibility.

500
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,260
Don't encourage them, Loki.

501
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,940
If they overhear that, they don't have to encourage them.

502
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,260
Thankfully they've been playing mostly Roblox stuff.

503
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,900
So they haven't really been playing the switch.

504
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,900
But I'm sure we'll get the new Zelda game and the remastered Zelda game.

505
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,700
So yeah.

506
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Hold up.

507
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,960
Mike Defton chat says PlayStation fives here cost fifteen thousand Mexican pesos.

508
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,340
That's about seven hundred and fifty dollars USD.

509
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,300
But at least you can find them more easily.

510
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,260
So you mean I can walk into I don't know what the big electronic stores are in Mexico.

511
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,540
I'll assume we live in a world where fries still exist in Mexico.

512
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,520
So I can still walk into fries Mexico and pick up a PlayStation five off the shelf.

513
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,660
I just have to pay like, you know, 250 extra dollars for it, which totally goes against

514
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,900
everything I believe in when it comes to scalpers anyway.

515
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,180
But at least at least in that scenario where they're kind of importing things, it makes

516
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,540
a little more sense.

517
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,060
Mike Defton says maybe.

518
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Wow.

519
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Wow.

520
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
All right.

521
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Interesting.

522
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,660
Well, Tiger cloud does remind us the switch OLED is not going to make the games play better.

523
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,220
Sure it has a better screen, but it's not going to improve the quality of the games,

524
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,120
but they'll look better.

525
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,540
That's what's not on your TV, though, won't affect us.

526
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Look at that.

527
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
That's true.

528
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Not on your TV.

529
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,100
And the Tiger also brings up the joy cons.

530
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,300
They're the same as the original switch.

531
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,740
So they didn't fix the drift problem.

532
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Oh, yes.

533
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,820
I heard somebody would have learned by now.

534
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,740
I heard somebody asked Nintendo directly about that and got like a no comment in response,

535
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,260
which means, yes, it's the same.

536
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
And they haven't.

537
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,540
How how have they not fixed the same?

538
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
That's setting themselves.

539
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,460
Oh, oh, that's a choice.

540
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
That is a choice.

541
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Nintendo.

542
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
That is a choice.

543
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
All right.

544
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,340
Speaking of choices, I made a very good choice by having Alan go to Costco before the show

545
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,740
because he put down in front of me earlier a churro from Costco.

546
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:36,180
So I have a Costco churro that I'm going to chow down on while Dark Soccer tells us about

547
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
her gaming week.

548
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
So how was your get?

549
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,140
What are the choices you made with your gaming week this week, Dark Soccer?

550
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,680
Still no Animal Crossing.

551
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,700
Basically it's been Dead by Daylight and Fantasian, but when I was streaming Fantasian, my Internet

552
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,340
cut out was sad.

553
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,860
I'm really in that grindy part where I need to buff up a couple of my characters so I

554
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,740
may not play it on stream anymore for a little bit until I finish the buffing.

555
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,340
So it's really been mostly Dead by Daylight.

556
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:17,780
I've been participating in the event and bringing out my cake and I have not yet gotten a five

557
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,640
cake match.

558
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:27,020
I got a four cake match and some jackass brought escape cake, which doesn't help me at all.

559
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,780
How very dare they?

560
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm playing my worst games and of course we have pinball going on, so that's it.

561
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
All right.

562
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,500
Have you gotten some killer crowns?

563
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:46,180
Oh, I got all the killer crowns, which I mean, for the characters that you can get them.

564
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,760
I did pick up a couple of survivor perks just in case it happens.

565
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,260
So I got like live and dead hard because everyone either uses live or dead hard.

566
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
So I figured, huh?

567
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:09,780
Um, but other than that, um, I, I've just been, I got my crown on twins and it's enough

568
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,020
to know that I hate playing twins.

569
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,980
I hate playing Blort, who will always be called Blort to me.

570
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,100
Oh, he is hard.

571
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,660
He's harder than nurse in many ways.

572
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Yeah.

573
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,660
Yeah.

574
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,820
As a nurse, it's just a matter of getting, uh, getting used to how the blinks work, which

575
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
I do have to show.

576
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:37,420
I don't remember their names, but these, uh, I, I think that they realized that I was legit

577
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,900
a baby nurse and it was right before end game collapse.

578
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,420
A couple of, uh, a couple of, uh, survivors actually just, I could tell that's what they

579
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
were doing.

580
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,340
They were letting me practice my blinks.

581
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,880
And I thought that was really nice.

582
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,640
You know, usually I get nothing but, you know, sweaty, toxic survivors who like to do the

583
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,520
butt dance and, you know, act like children.

584
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,640
Um, which to me I think is unnecessary and probably a skilled player shouldn't do that

585
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,960
if they're mature.

586
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,640
Um, but at any rate, um, they were really nice.

587
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,760
They just let me run around.

588
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,480
They seem to know I got a couple of hits in, it was pretty cool.

589
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,360
I would just let one run off and go after the other and let, you know, we just run around

590
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,400
all of the Yamaoka estate and it was pretty cool.

591
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Yeah.

592
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Um, I had some interesting matches.

593
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,880
I was playing as killer as well.

594
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,480
And um, you know, some were like, I played a few pyramid head matches and in one match,

595
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
like they did not want it.

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
Like it was a five cake match.

597
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,000
They did not want to farm.

598
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,120
I was like, I was out in the middle drawing circles.

599
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm like, come here and let's farm.

600
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,700
They didn't want to do it.

601
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,860
And so, but then I got another one where some idiot DC'd right.

602
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,780
Well, maybe it wasn't their fault, but they DC'd right when the match started and I ended

603
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,260
up unintentionally slugging the other three.

604
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,220
I didn't mean to, but I actually, I picked one up and let them get out so they could

605
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
go pick somebody up.

606
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,860
And I was like, all right, we're going to farm.

607
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Then here's the punchline.

608
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,980
So they finally get the door open and then I get booted from the game.

609
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,120
I think my game freezes and I get DC'd.

610
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,300
So you know how many blood points I got?

611
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Zero.

612
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm so mad.

613
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,140
I'm going to play the DVD for the rest of the day because behavior has made a great

614
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,700
game that runs like garbage.

615
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,940
You know, I did, I did actually have an interesting match and it was actually one of the, it was,

616
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,580
I think my third time playing Freddy and I actually had a really good one.

617
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:42,660
I had, uh, one DC, two kills and I was about to get a Meg and I closed the hatch by accident.

618
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,780
I was going to let her go.

619
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,180
And so she's slugged, no one to heal her.

620
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,180
And I can't open the gate once the apparently once the hatches closed, you can't open the

621
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
gate.

622
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Right.

623
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,580
So what I did is I picked her up and ran around until she got down and then we went and hung

624
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,900
back over by the gate so I could let her out or she could let herself out.

625
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,660
But you know, it was, it was, that also had like one of the most annoying Dwight's ever.

626
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
It was great.

627
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Hanging that guy.

628
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
All right, I'm done.

629
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
All right.

630
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Enough dead by daylight.

631
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Let's go to somebody who doesn't play that game.

632
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
Let's go to Loki.

633
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Loki, how was your game?

634
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
I don't play that game.

635
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
You don't play that game.

636
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
What do you play?

637
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
It's just Minecraft.

638
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,500
And so that's what I've been doing, just still playing on the server.

639
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,760
Mainly this week was just finishing up the design of the build that I'm going to be working

640
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,780
on here pretty soon.

641
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,140
I think also gathering resources for that as well.

642
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:46,020
So there was actually a lot of mining being done and harassing the server admins about

643
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,100
our spawn rates because we were, we've had an issue and I brought it up in my last video

644
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,860
where no mobs were spawning, which kind of makes it hard to run a mob farm that requires

645
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,380
those mobs to be spawning.

646
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,000
And so it's been like fixed and broken all throughout the week.

647
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,660
So I think it's now finally actually working again.

648
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:14,020
But that kind of put a lot of my plans I had to make other mob farms on hold for a while.

649
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Also with my new shop they have, which sells axolotls, they have the rare blue one, which

650
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,860
prior to 117.1, you could actually just find those in the wild.

651
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:30,020
And so I was actually planning on building a upgraded farm to farm those because otherwise

652
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,700
you have to breed them and it's like a one in 1200 chance of getting one and it's a real

653
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,420
pain in the ass to do that.

654
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,860
So unfortunately, now that we've updated the 117.1, that is my only option.

655
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,300
So I'm going to raise the price on those.

656
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,340
But yeah, it's mainly been just Minecraft.

657
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,540
So now I'm finally getting to the point where I'm going to start that build for my new video.

658
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,880
Had to terraform a bunch of stuff.

659
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,860
So that's taken a long time because it's a massive build.

660
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:07,020
It's like 40 blocks by 42 and I think 70 tall, just this massive factory.

661
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,860
So I'm going to be doing that.

662
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,260
And then I don't know from there, I've been trying to get more people involved with like

663
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,540
doing streaming or like content creation, but it's like it's not happening, which is

664
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,560
very disappointing, especially not to complain, but I'm going to.

665
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,600
We had somebody leave our server and apparently they're an admin or they run their own other

666
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,640
another SMP and the guy started off his brand new YouTube channel and it's already getting

667
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:47,160
like 1000 views per video, just a brand new thing, which is frustrating when you have

668
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,440
a hermit from hermitcraft in your episode and you can't pull more than 200 views.

669
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
A little frustrating.

670
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,200
So I will keep at it, stick at it.

671
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,160
You just, you never know the one that's going to catch fire.

672
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,420
You just have to stick with it.

673
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,560
That's all it is.

674
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,760
It's hard because I gotta put the cat down.

675
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
It's hard.

676
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Put the cat in the video.

677
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
I bet you'll get a lot of hits for that.

678
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Oh, gosh.

679
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Stella plays Minecraft.

680
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
She's shedding like crazy.

681
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,400
So it's hard because like a server like that, where you have a lot of people on that server

682
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,280
actually doing content creation, they share their view, their audience.

683
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,800
And so each person may bring in like a hundred people or so, and then you're sharing audiences

684
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
and that's how you grow grandically.

685
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,600
That was the hope when I joined the server that, Oh, Hey, there's multiple people making

686
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
content.

687
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,240
And when I came on, that was the case, there was a few people had a couple episodes.

688
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
Now there's nobody, it's just like, it's just me.

689
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,720
And so the only con the only audience I can grow is the people that are on the server

690
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,440
watching themselves.

691
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,640
And then maybe anybody else I can try to like get in with advertising on a bunch, like on

692
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,140
different discords, like I'm on a bunch of the hermit's discord.

693
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,740
So they have like media sharing things.

694
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,000
So I posted in there, I posted forums, I posted on Twitter, social media, like everywhere.

695
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,120
And it's just nothing like, it's just nothing, but I'm going to keep at it.

696
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,820
It's just, it's frustrating.

697
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
Change your server.

698
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,920
If it, if it isn't, if everybody abandoned ship, then yeah, but I can't, I don't want

699
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,760
to right now, but just because they like the other server, it would have like had that

700
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,720
sort of been in existence at the time, I probably would have joined something like that, but

701
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,240
there's like so many, it's hard to say like how it would have even gone, but we'll see.

702
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,760
I just am a little frustrated seeing like, cause not to like dog on like people and in

703
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,760
the quality of their content, but like his video was bad.

704
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,760
His audio was terrible and yeah, he's pulling in 900 reviews on this first feels like that's

705
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
frustrating.

706
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,840
Like that is absolutely frustrating.

707
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Aren't you?

708
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,040
Aren't you used to it by now from this podcast?

709
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,080
Like I'm not, I'm not saying high quality podcast or anything, but I heard some of the

710
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
ones that have caught fire though.

711
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,720
I will never forget the one I listened to and this is a very popular show and no, I'm

712
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,280
not going to name it because I am not that kind of person, but I listened to it and I'm

713
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,280
like, this guy sounds like he's being held prisoner and doesn't want to be here talking

714
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,460
about these retro games.

715
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,540
This guy does not sound like he wants to be here at all and I just, I was so bored because

716
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,640
he was bored and it was like infectious and all that stuff.

717
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,020
So I don't understand sometimes how some of these like bigger names and things that catch

718
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,260
fire, uh, do as well as they do.

719
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
So yeah.

720
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,940
And I don't know either lucky to have what we have and I do mean it.

721
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
We do.

722
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,860
I just, I, I understand that.

723
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,700
I just wish the community that I played with would stop leaving the server and I wish that

724
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,640
they would actually play and like check cause like this entire week when I was playing,

725
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,580
there was nobody on and I get it like fourth of July holiday and stuff like that.

726
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,940
Probably people were gone during the week or vacationing during the summer, but like

727
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,340
nobody was on, it was just me period.

728
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:03,300
Like it's starting to, it's starting to look like the VoG Minecraft server where it's just

729
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
like started off.

730
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,300
I got like a few people playing and it was like doing all that and then nobody.

731
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
So it's like,

732
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,300
I need a button for that shade sound from RuPaul's drag race.

733
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,340
I have a button actually.

734
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
It's frustrating.

735
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,140
I just, I wish we got more engagement.

736
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,660
I wish we had more people playing and stuff like that.

737
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:29,460
And I know like I get individuals on the server reaching out and saying, Hey, you know, you

738
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,600
know, we want to do voice chat.

739
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,820
We can do that or something like that.

740
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,660
But like these people are never on it.

741
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
I don't know.

742
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,660
We'll see.

743
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,060
I just have to stick it with it for now, but like it's getting frustrating.

744
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,580
For what it's worth, you have some nice folks in chat.

745
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,100
Bobby Blackwell says you're the only Minecraft YouTuber I watch.

746
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,660
And Mike Deft uses the arrow to kind of indicate the same thing there.

747
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,860
She Hulk suggests get a cat cam and the money will pour in.

748
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,660
That's that's what I'm saying, you know.

749
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,660
And again, to get a cat cam or a hot tub, hot tub Minecraft stream, Loki.

750
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,460
I'm going to sink money in for a hot tub.

751
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Why don't you?

752
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Okay.

753
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,260
Build a hot tub in Minecraft and call it your Minecraft hot tubs video.

754
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,260
And then make the thumbnail something completely different.

755
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:25,100
Well, it's like on TikTok, my highest hitting my two highest videos is one where I'm watching

756
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:32,260
Oscar, you know, a WWE talk about her TikTok channel and one of me petting Midna.

757
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,060
The OK, I'm a little older, so I just turned 43.

758
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm having a hard time understanding the tic tac.

759
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,300
But all I know is that somebody older than you, somebody somebody told me to start one

760
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,860
the last time I was at Rocky Horror.

761
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,660
So pre pandemic and I did a really dumb little video on there and it has like 550 views.

762
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,660
I'm like, OK, for like not I was like, so maybe I need to explore the taktaks a little

763
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
more.

764
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:05,660
I've been I've been putting up like some of my my clips from my channel and sometimes

765
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,460
I'll like set them to an intro outro with some of my own music on it.

766
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,060
I've seen that come through my feet, actually.

767
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,060
So it gets it gets seen.

768
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,660
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I joined TikTok.

769
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,860
I haven't posted yet.

770
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:27,060
I'm telling you, Bobby, post that little rap that you did or Micro Machines spiel that

771
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,360
you did at Games Done Quick on TikTok.

772
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,860
And that would probably get a lot of views, although to be fair, since it's really about

773
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,460
the charity, I don't know if Games Done Quick runs a TikTok, but maybe they should have

774
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
it.

775
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,660
But I that would spread, I bet, because that was really good.

776
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
All right.

777
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Well, I'll stop.

778
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,660
I'll stop complaining.

779
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,120
But like, yeah, so that that video will be coming very soon, depending on how long it

780
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,660
takes to build this thing, because it's it's big, but it's pretty cool, I thought.

781
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,260
And this is J100 Matt giving some advice, saying if your goal is to get rich quick with

782
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,560
YouTube, it's going to take a while and a lot of dedication.

783
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,760
Just got to keep grinding and you will get the hits.

784
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,060
The key is posting consistently.

785
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Well, not to speak for Loki because he's right there, but I don't think it's about getting

786
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
rich quick.

787
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,960
I think it's just about can we find some new people to, you know, can we can we get more,

788
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,120
you know, people to see this stuff?

789
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,660
It's about visibility, I guess, maybe a better word.

790
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Yeah, it's visibility.

791
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Yeah.

792
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Yeah.

793
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,460
I'm not looking to get rich.

794
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,560
I mean, that's not going to happen anytime soon.

795
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
No, it's just to get visibility.

796
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,560
I basically just like I want to see like more organic growth.

797
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
I do want to I'm trying to post consistently.

798
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,160
I think I need to scale well, over scoping again, you know, I need to scale back your

799
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
project size.

800
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah, me.

801
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Yeah.

802
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,960
But I've been trying to like, do like stuff that's interesting, you know, and I get a

803
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
lot.

804
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
It depends on the style.

805
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,460
Like there's some people that will do large builds each video.

806
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,460
There's some people they'll just like kinda more old school where it's like, okay, and

807
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,660
I'm wandering around.

808
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,960
It depends on like, I have to do large builds because I have no one to interact with that.

809
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,460
That's why if it was just like, I'm going to goof off with this person, then yeah, I

810
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
could do that.

811
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,760
But you have to have other people to interact with in order to be able to do that type of

812
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,160
content that's I don't have that and it's it's just all me I've got to I've got to build

813
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
big things.

814
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,560
Somebody wants to goof off with Loki and Minecraft and have some fun.

815
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
Hit him up on Twitter at Loki O.L.R.

816
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Yes.

817
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,560
And we'll we'll have you join the server because there's people there's people coming in every

818
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
day.

819
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,460
There's got to be somebody listening here who still plays Minecraft who would enjoy

820
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,160
just spending an hour playing with you and doing stupid builds building the hot tub in

821
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Minecraft.

822
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Yeah.

823
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
All right.

824
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,060
My gaming week.

825
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,260
So I already played Dead by Daylight.

826
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
I talked about that.

827
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,960
I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14 because of course this is me.

828
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,560
They just released a benchmark for Endwalker the next expansion.

829
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,960
That was some big news from this weekend that I don't think is on our show roll.

830
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,400
So you can check that out on the official Final Fantasy 14 website if you just want

831
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,700
to play around with the character creator.

832
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,420
So I've actually made my male Viera or my boy bunny who I've just well should I say

833
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
that?

834
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
No I'm not going to say the name.

835
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,500
I'm going to have to wait because I need to make sure I can get the name before I say

836
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,380
it because sometimes people will steal it.

837
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,740
But I have a really good name picked out.

838
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,860
So we'll have that.

839
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,560
And yeah my character looks really cool.

840
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,700
So I like the benchmark and otherwise still just trying to get all my characters to 80

841
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,440
before the expansion comes out in Final Fantasy 14.

842
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,520
Another game I ever played when I'd name I'd name her little bunny boo boo little walking

843
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,700
through the forest scooping up.

844
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,420
I like that right.

845
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:51,500
So I found I found another game to play this week and it's just I don't know how I found

846
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,020
this game all by myself completely unprovoked or told that I should check this out just

847
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
out of the blue.

848
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,120
I found myself checking out Yakuza like a dragon.

849
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,980
I checked out on Xbox Game Pass.

850
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
OK.

851
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,100
Obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because people have been yelling at

852
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,500
me for a very long time that I need to a play the Yakuza series B specifically this

853
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,440
entry in the Yakuza series.

854
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,040
So I finally around the Fourth of July holiday downloaded it because finally the bandwidth

855
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,140
rolled over.

856
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,000
And since we were out of town for a couple of days we didn't use bandwidth.

857
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,040
So I was like OK this is a good time for me to download Yakuza.

858
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:33,240
So I did and I've been playing it a lot since the fourth I'm already like 10 hours into

859
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
the game.

860
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,980
Somewhere into like Chapter 4 at this point and I'm having a good time.

861
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:44,980
Like it's it's it's I was not prepared for I knew the Yakuza was very story heavy.

862
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,700
I wasn't really prepared for how story heavy it is.

863
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,220
I was very like wow there is like a lot going on here and there's a lot of especially in

864
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,020
the first chapter.

865
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,260
It's a lot of just watching it's like a very persona kind of intro where it's like or Kingdom

866
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,740
Hearts 2.

867
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,380
You're just watching cut scene after cut scene after cut scene with like maybe three battles

868
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,040
in the entire chapter.

869
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,080
But it wasn't bad like I found myself kind of like fascinated like what's going on what's

870
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
going to happen.

871
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,800
What's you know and all this there's already like twists and things like that happening.

872
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,480
So yeah I'm not going to spoil anything but yes I played enough to get to Chapter 4 where

873
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,460
things start to open up and there's side quests.

874
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,800
And because I think because this is a Sega game or whatever there are some crazy ass

875
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,660
side quests like I laughed my ass off.

876
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,100
There's one where you get in a little bicycle and you drive around collecting cans and it's

877
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,180
like a little racer game that's built into it.

878
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,460
I haven't really dinked around at the Sega arcades or pachinko machines but I know that's

879
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,580
a full other thing too that's in the game.

880
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,020
And then there's just like all these weird little side things that you can do.

881
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,040
That's pretty cool.

882
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,980
The game is dirty as hell.

883
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,200
This is basically an NC-17 rated Final Fantasy game is what it is.

884
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,660
It's Final Fantasy 15 and that bro quest if it was NC-17 rated is kind of what it is honestly.

885
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,000
It's dirty.

886
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,720
It's violent.

887
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,920
It's got sex sex sex sex all over it and everything is boring.

888
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,120
There's violence and a lot of uses of the F word as well.

889
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
It's everything.

890
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:37,340
All the nasty stuff you can think of it's there.

891
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's a Japanese crime drama continually interrupted by episodes

892
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,500
of The Simpsons.

893
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
That's a very good way of putting it.

894
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:52,840
So on my Twitter I put a game capture because like I was doing a side quest and I was like

895
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,800
look I've hosted the Rocky Horror Picture Show for like years and years and years.

896
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,180
I've done a lot of you know other cult cinema.

897
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,180
I've even hosted a horror movie fest and everything.

898
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,780
It takes a lot to like make me go what the fuck is this.

899
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,380
But there was a scene that happened in Yakuza where I was like what the fuck is this.

900
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,960
Like what in the act.

901
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,780
This is in my video game.

902
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,320
This is happening.

903
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,620
And it was it was basically a side quest in this economy.

904
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,520
It was a side quest where you hear like a baby crying.

905
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,160
And so it's a really short quest and this does not spoil the main story whatsoever.

906
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,920
If you are really going to be hurt that I'm spoiling one tiny little side quest then I'm

907
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
sorry.

908
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,580
That was also done in a speed run.

909
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,240
But so what happened on the side quest you hear a baby cry.

910
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
No this is not rugby baby.

911
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
That's different Yakuza game.

912
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Oh that was different.

913
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
OK.

914
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Yeah.

915
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,600
There's a baby crying upstairs or something.

916
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,840
And you have a guy who has baby formula.

917
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,020
Long story short you decide you're going to take the baby formula up to the crying

918
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,980
baby but you need hot water.

919
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,420
So the side quest is you got to go to the cafe get the hot water come back and then

920
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,020
you go upstairs and you find out that the babies that are crying are grown men and they're

921
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:09,500
wearing diapers and they're being it's a fetish studio or something that you just walked in

922
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,500
and crash.

923
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,060
And because these guys happen to be rival Yakuza then the surprise in the side quest

924
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,300
is these babies want to kick your ass basically.

925
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,180
So you have to fight these man babies and then at the end you get to make a very Bioware

926
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:30,320
esque choice on do you want to run out of there.

927
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,240
Do you want to tell them off or whatever or do you want to join them and have a bottle

928
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,080
together with them.

929
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,800
And so of course I picked the option where I wanted to have a bottle with them and the

930
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,760
screen just fades to black at that point.

931
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,680
So there was that.

932
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,340
And Bobby Blackwell says yes and then he becomes a summon.

933
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,060
So that is a whole other thing is that instead of summons like Final Fantasy you have people

934
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,180
you call on your phone that show up for money and kick people's ass.

935
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:05,780
And so a man baby fetish dude is one of the people that you can call when you're in trouble.

936
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:11,740
Let's see Mike Defton chat says that's an actual thing in Japan not not just Japan.

937
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,740
Did you see my response.

938
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,080
Yes I did.

939
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,020
There's a Web site called Craigslist and there's a there's a well not sadly not anymore.

940
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,320
There's other where one Web site goes down others go up.

941
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,320
So yes there's there's players and kink Web sites out there that are for networking and

942
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,680
yes it's a thing.

943
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,120
And I'm not here to shame nobody and what they want to do consensually behind closed

944
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,160
doors.

945
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,620
I just was not expecting to see that in a video game like you know there's a lot of

946
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,920
plot twists and I can call a lot of plot twists.

947
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,600
That was not a plot twist I was prepared for OK.

948
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,720
That's just all I'm saying.

949
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,740
But yeah yeah whatever you want to do consensually behind closed door y'all's business.

950
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:58,860
That is that is y'all all right anyway.

951
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,400
So that's my long story about my experience of the Yakuza like a dragon.

952
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,840
But I am I am enjoying it and the story is is good.

953
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,480
And yeah now I'm curious to go back and check out other Yakuza games.

954
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,460
Although I hear that the other get zero through six.

955
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
Is it.

956
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,900
And this this would kind of be seven I guess.

957
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,180
So zero through six are like beat them ups.

958
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,900
So they're different.

959
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,220
But but I think the main part of it with the crazy story twists the things I'm talking

960
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,260
about that part is still all the same.

961
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,440
It's just the actual what happens when you get in the encounters with band dude bad dudes

962
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
is a little bit.

963
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:41,700
Didn't a couple of them have Kitano Takeshi doing some roles.

964
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,700
I think so.

965
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,460
I think he's in that rugby baby scene.

966
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
Yeah he was.

967
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:53,100
But he's also been like one of his big claims to fame was doing you know Yakuza movies.

968
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,100
You know.

969
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,100
Yeah.

970
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,860
So anyway it's it's a fascinating game.

971
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:02,820
Actually Jamie if you could you know just look away at some of the nasty stuff.

972
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,220
Well you're you're in a grown adult.

973
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
You can look right at it.

974
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,200
It's just one of those things where it's like I think if you can kind of get through some

975
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,360
of the weird shit there's a lot of lore in the game and I know you love lore and there's

976
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,440
a lot to the story there are some interesting shit in it.

977
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,140
So I got to say it might be worth your time especially if you have game pass.

978
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,220
It's worth checking out.

979
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,160
So yeah and I don't and I don't really touch our PS4.

980
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,720
Oh this is actually I'm playing on Xbox but yeah I don't have a new Xbox plus when I have

981
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
was a 360.

982
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,720
I don't.

983
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,500
It's not on 360 bummer.

984
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,140
I don't know if I honestly I haven't cared.

985
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,140
I'll be honest.

986
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,020
Well that's not the kind of game I'm into.

987
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,580
I put it off for a long time too and then I was like oh this is kind of fun.

988
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,260
Oh PC version is coming.

989
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,260
Got it.

990
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,260
Got it.

991
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,260
Well who's on the PC.

992
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,260
I'm not.

993
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,260
That's right.

994
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,260
That's right.

995
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,260
I keep forgetting you.

996
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,060
Well you still play stuff through.

997
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,060
I'm going to put it this way.

998
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,480
I don't even like to watch many Yakuza movies.

999
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
All right.

1000
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
Fair enough.

1001
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,520
It's not something I am interested in at all.

1002
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,560
But thank you.

1003
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,120
But for it to clarify for others out there who may be curious Mike Deaf does say it is

1004
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,440
on X cloud.

1005
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,360
So their their version of that.

1006
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,240
So that would allow you to play it on pretty much any any device there.

1007
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
So interesting.

1008
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Interesting.

1009
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Yeah.

1010
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,320
Questmaster says the protagonist zero through six is more serious.

1011
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,560
His persona only makes the bizarre side quests and activities even better.

1012
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,100
That would be my one read on the game is the one my one little thing is that I do get

1013
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,380
very frustrated that the main character is to put it bluntly like an idiot a dumbass.

1014
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,500
He's completely wow.

1015
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,220
And I get very frustrated sometimes I'm watching these cut scenes where I'm like let me have

1016
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:52,380
a human bowling ball what like playing a human bowling ball much pretty much.

1017
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,060
He's just yeah he's he gets very frustrating in some situations.

1018
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,640
But my my hope is because I'm because I already kind of see it a little bit that I'm early

1019
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,640
on in the game.

1020
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,600
I'm supposed to get irritated with that.

1021
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,120
But then there's like redemption towards the end of the game where you know he becomes

1022
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,480
a lot more tolerable.

1023
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:18,400
But that's the one little thing where I'm like anyway all right yeah as Joe and Matt

1024
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,440
says each bonds the lovable idiot I guess his name is number one.

1025
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah yeah.

1026
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,760
And people call him out on that in game two which is really funny.

1027
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,540
They're like no really what's your name.

1028
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,060
I think it does get funny.

1029
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,060
It doesn't get funny.

1030
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,060
All right.

1031
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,060
Enough enough about that game.

1032
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,060
Let's talk about other stuff.

1033
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,600
Oh actually before we get into other news I do want to shout it out like four times

1034
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:44,300
now but I want to give officially a shout out to Vogue Network's own Bobby Black Wolf

1035
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,340
and all the other folks behind the scenes who made summer games done quick that speed

1036
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,760
running marathon happened.

1037
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,780
They raised right around two point nine million dollars for Doctors Without Borders a wonderful

1038
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,720
charity and just lots of great speed runs that were played throughout the week.

1039
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,760
And of course as you've been hearing on Vogue Network throughout the past few weeks Bobby

1040
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,360
Black Wolf he's one of the hosts during the event so he's reading donations and things

1041
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,420
and he was the host with the very last thing that you saw which was that Kingdom Hearts

1042
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,400
2 speed run where they ran that entire game.

1043
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,520
I think it was about three hours 12 minutes when all was said and I think the estimate

1044
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,760
was three hours 15 minutes and it got in right under the estimate.

1045
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
And it was really impressive.

1046
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,780
And the Sephiroth battle and that other one.

1047
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:32,580
Yeah there were those extra battles that he did too which were really all at level one

1048
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,060
which was the fascinating thing too.

1049
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,020
And it was great to watch some of the donations come in and hear some of those getting read

1050
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,100
because my favorite donation that was read they were trying to do the incentive to unlock

1051
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:50,220
that Sephiroth battle and somebody donated as Sephiroth and said one v one me.

1052
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,320
I thought that was really funny.

1053
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,220
And then the second one that says never mind don't can I have my money back.

1054
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,220
I did.

1055
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,220
I heard that one too.

1056
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,220
That was funny.

1057
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,340
But I laughed out loud and I heard that whole one v one me.

1058
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,340
You won't.

1059
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,340
Yeah.

1060
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,900
Dan and I had a laugh.

1061
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,140
That was pretty good.

1062
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,140
So yeah.

1063
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,140
No.

1064
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,140
Great.

1065
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,140
Great job.

1066
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,140
Great speed runs.

1067
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,140
It was it was a good time.

1068
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,140
So yeah.

1069
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,920
Looking forward to awesome games done quick which maybe they're going to do in person.

1070
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,220
They're kind of not committing to that yet which I completely understand because they

1071
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,400
got to see how things play out in the coming months I'm sure.

1072
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,600
But they're going to it is on their radar to try to get it back in person in January

1073
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,220
which they kind of mentioned there at the end.

1074
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,760
So that would be great if that can happen.

1075
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,760
So yeah.

1076
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,420
Dan and I did our donation last night.

1077
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,420
It didn't get read.

1078
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,420
But I understand.

1079
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,420
You know it happens.

1080
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,420
It happens.

1081
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,920
But I did say that I love games that have Tron levels in them.

1082
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Oh there you go.

1083
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Yeah.

1084
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Nice.

1085
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,920
I was waiting the whole thing for the Tron level and it was like over in five minutes.

1086
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
I did.

1087
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,360
I did have a donation read last night but like the first year I didn't have mine read.

1088
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,300
So it just depends on what gets through and what doesn't.

1089
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,140
And you know it all happens.

1090
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,400
All right.

1091
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,100
But if you want to hear more about the behind the scenes stuff on what they're looking for

1092
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,000
and all that stuff I will send you over to the Bobby Blackwell show and given his show

1093
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,380
a nice cheap plug there which comes on live right before us here at VOG Network or of

1094
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,140
course he has a robust part podcast archive with lots of stories behind the scenes and

1095
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,060
all of that as well over at the Bobby Black Wolf show.

1096
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,060
OK.

1097
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:33,780
I want to give Bobby a thank you by the way for doing the debut of my little remix.

1098
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,300
My my Sanic.

1099
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,660
So there's another reason to check out a show this week.

1100
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,820
You'll hear a lot about Summer Games done quick and you get to hear that world premiere

1101
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:48,620
of your Sanic Green Hill Zone remix which is which I love the Green Hill Zone music

1102
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:55,340
so much that I wanted to pretty much keep it like as the Green Hill Zone music but enhanced

1103
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
if that makes sense.

1104
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,820
It's Green Hill Zone OLED version.

1105
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,820
No.

1106
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,140
All right.

1107
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,140
Green Hill Zone Pro.

1108
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,140
It was good.

1109
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,140
It was good.

1110
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,140
All right.

1111
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,140
Let's move on.

1112
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,220
Let's get into some other gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.

1113
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,620
OK.

1114
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,620
We'll start with you.

1115
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,620
Yeah.

1116
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:20,580
So there is actually one of those PlayStation state of play is this week as well.

1117
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,580
And we got to see some more footage of different games some that we already knew were coming.

1118
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:31,220
For example we have a date now for the Death Stranding director's cut which is gonna be

1119
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,060
September 24th and they kind of showed off some new modes in there as well including

1120
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:41,100
a racing mode and also they announced that there's gonna be a $10 upgrade if you have

1121
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,260
the PlayStation 4 version already and that cross saves will be supported.

1122
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,340
So that's kind of cool.

1123
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,900
More footage of Deathloop.

1124
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,860
I mean we see that almost every single time so that game still looks cool.

1125
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,700
Lost Judgment looks awesome since we were just talking about Yakuza.

1126
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,020
Really looking forward to checking that one out when that comes out.

1127
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,020
What else?

1128
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:14,580
We have a new trailer for Jet which looks interesting Jet the Far Shore.

1129
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:19,260
It's kind of like a sci-fi adventure game.

1130
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,220
Fist which you know it's funny it's like I have this game confused with there's another

1131
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,460
one that just came out about like anthropomorphic animals and stuff like that in like a post

1132
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,320
apocalyptic setting.

1133
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,400
I actually thought the one that came out now was this game already but this is a little

1134
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
bit different.

1135
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,560
This is actually coming out now on PlayStation 4 and 5 and on September 7th.

1136
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,000
It's a side scroller game but it looks pretty awesome it's about this like rabbit character

1137
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,760
with this giant mechanical fist he fights with.

1138
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,280
Oh so it's not Watership Down.

1139
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,480
No not Watership Down.

1140
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,160
This Watership Down is like part Bionic Commando I mean that's what it kind of looks like.

1141
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,360
Watership Down the fighting game.

1142
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,960
But it looks really cool.

1143
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,000
So this looks much better than the one that just came out.

1144
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,520
A new hero shooter called Arcade or Arcade Geddon and that's something that was actually

1145
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:16,680
out now in early access so you can check that out and there's a new Moss game coming out

1146
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,720
so Moss Book 2 which was a game that was originally out on the PlayStation VR.

1147
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,480
So now that's getting a sequel which is pretty cool.

1148
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:32,160
They showed Tribes of Midgard a little bit and a new game called Hunter's Arena Legends

1149
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,920
which is another battle royale game.

1150
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
What else?

1151
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Demon Slayer.

1152
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,200
I don't even know how to pronounce this.

1153
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:48,000
The Hinokami Chronicles and yeah I think that's about it.

1154
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,720
I noticed Seafood Flight Club.

1155
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,560
That was another game but that's been delayed till 2022 but I know that's something that

1156
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,120
showed off before.

1157
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:04,080
Looks a lot like what was the other I don't remember the name of the game now but yeah

1158
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,760
it looks familiar.

1159
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,620
I noticed that even though we had you know a lot of kind of newer IPs and newer ideas

1160
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,760
and maybe not AAA games but still you know they're games that are on their way out and

1161
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,960
you know a lot of them look fun.

1162
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,960
I still noticed that the state of play kind of got a very meh reaction from people online

1163
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,280
but I kind of again I think this is a case of gamers were setting their expectations

1164
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,040
a little too high because for yeah I don't know how the fuck this got this started that

1165
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,440
people were saying oh Final Fantasy 16 has to show up in the state of play.

1166
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,440
I think people were kind of making the jump.

1167
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:44,560
Well because Sony didn't do an E3 presentation this is Sony's E3 presentation.

1168
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
Oh yeah.

1169
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,520
Therefore they must show Final Fantasy 16.

1170
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:55,160
That's where the logic train was going on social media and this really is not what so

1171
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:01,080
like again Sony said it was going to be Deathloop footage and some other things.

1172
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:05,480
If they were going to show Final Fantasy 16 that would they were not going to bury that

1173
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,160
lead right.

1174
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,400
Well yeah exactly and also like I think these are like monthly that they do these state

1175
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,320
of plays I'm pretty sure that they did one before E3 as well.

1176
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,960
They've been doing it more regularly than Nintendo Directs to be quite honest.

1177
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,560
I don't yeah I had no expectations unless you count the indies if you count the indies

1178
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:32,620
then they're about the same probably sure but like I don't know it's fine I had no expectations

1179
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:39,800
of it I definitely wasn't expecting them announcing major new titles but yeah Deathloop is cool

1180
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:47,360
and all but like like I don't I feel like we're we're kind of getting into you know

1181
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:53,760
No Man's Sky territory it's not necessarily No Man's Sky but like Last of Us 2 and stuff

1182
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,020
like we're just like we're we're just shoving the footage down your throat it's like okay

1183
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:02,480
dude I've seen Deathloop I get the concept of the game yeah it looks cool I don't need

1184
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,180
to see 10 minutes of footage every single state of play yeah like it's a little like

1185
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,620
I get it it's gonna be awesome but I don't need to see it every time like we could have

1186
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,820
cut that 10 minutes short or like spent 10 minutes promoting something else you know

1187
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:25,080
yeah yeah I'm I think there is such a such thing as like too much promotion although

1188
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,580
Sony did warn you but I think I would say that you know if Sony wanted to do a deep

1189
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:36,140
dive on Deathloop then have a state of play or whatever be only that I think maybe the

1190
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:41,100
problem there was that they said it was gonna be Deathloop and other stuff so because that

1191
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,580
other stuff was so vague even though I don't think anybody should have set their bar for

1192
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,300
Final Fantasy 16 you know if you want to see indies or you want to see you know what are

1193
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,860
some new games that are PlayStation you know you're gonna tune in and then it's like I

1194
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,820
have to sit through more of this game I've already seen a million I already pre-ordered

1195
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:03,460
it you know but I guess for other people it's hype you know if it was Final Fantasy 16 I'd

1196
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,540
probably be sitting there gobbling up each and every minute with a spoon so people are

1197
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:12,820
into what they're into but I also speaking of that coincidentally there was an interview

1198
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,100
very recent I think it was actually maybe during the live stream they were doing for

1199
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:22,620
Final Fantasy 14 now Kiyoshita who's the producer director of 14 as you all know is

1200
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:29,180
also gonna be overseeing 16 because creative unit 3 is working on both and he did say a

1201
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:34,860
little bit about 16 and he did say I think he's I don't want to misquote him but it was something

1202
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:40,020
along the lines of they may not be at Tokyo Game Show because they don't want to show the game

1203
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:47,320
again until basically it's ready and I'm kind of like another example of how Naoki

1204
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,580
Ashita just like gets it like he just they've announced it and now he doesn't he doesn't want

1205
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,340
to do the continuous hype for the game he just wants to when it's ready here's the launch trailer

1206
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:03,220
type of thing and and then go come out swinging and I think that's a brilliant way to do it but

1207
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,580
should also kind of set people's expectations now he said that after the state of play but that

1208
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,220
should also kind of set people's expectations that like you're not gonna see Final Fantasy 16

1209
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,380
until they're ready to tell you what what day it's coming out well yeah and it's also it makes sense

1210
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,140
because it's probably a lot of work for them to keep building vertical slices that show off in

1211
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:26,300
different trailers of the game just let them develop it without having to constantly put

1212
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:35,660
something out that you know the public can consume for sure all right um let's move on

1213
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:41,460
and talk about something that will probably not surprise anybody but the fact that they are doing

1214
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,260
another Assassin's Creed game but it might surprise you how this got unveiled Assassin's

1215
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:54,780
Creed infinity is the new game that is coming out and it was leaked out actually at first so

1216
01:02:54,860 --> 01:03:01,140
what happened is that Bloomberg oh you kids at Bloomberg here you go again but this one they

1217
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,020
got right so they reported that there is a new entry in the Assassin's Creed series it was going

1218
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:13,180
to be a live service game so it kind of cornered Ubisoft into actually confirming this it is called

1219
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:17,940
Assassin's Creed infinity internally so I'm sorry I didn't say that I'm specifically earlier this is

1220
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,860
a code name so it may not be the actual name of the game it's gonna be a collaboration between

1221
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:28,940
Ubisoft Montreal and Quebec and Ubisoft in a blog post said rather than continuing to pass the baton

1222
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,820
from game to game we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft's most beloved

1223
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:38,820
franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner there's really no other

1224
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,460
details from this so Ubisoft did not respond to anything else that was in the Bloomberg report

1225
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:51,900
including that whole live service so that part also still is a rumor at this time such as Grand

1226
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,500
Theft Auto five anthem those types of games usually of course Assassin's Creed games are

1227
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,860
single-player even though they're full of DLC so this would be a little bit different the Bloomberg

1228
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:07,580
reports isn't there for yeah they have like like almost all of their games are like live service

1229
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:16,020
games nowadays you know with what all of their Tom Clancy games right I mean they've got so many live

1230
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:25,740
service games it's kind of yuck also Ubisoft is yuck because you know they they basically don't

1231
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:30,700
address any of the harassment that's going on their company I was actually gonna follow up with

1232
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:36,180
that and kind of say that yeah there's all this news on Assassin's Creed infinity but the deal

1233
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:42,540
breaker for a lot of people here is that there's still a lot of really bad stuff trademark patent

1234
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:50,340
pending coming out of Ubisoft that seems to show that they perhaps are not addressing some of these

1235
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:56,460
issues that have been brought to light prior and that is that is very disappointing and at this

1236
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:02,900
point I'm starting to wonder if Eve's given is much longer for the company because this is

1237
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:08,860
clearly a problem that's trickling down from the top of course I have sat here and said all these

1238
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:14,580
CEOs need to be fired not all of them but a lot of them do and it doesn't seem to happen because

1239
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,820
I guess the money keeps coming in so I could sit here all day and go Eve's go on needs to go and

1240
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:29,140
it probably is not going to happen however it probably should so if you want us to take some

1241
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,660
of these and it does suck because of course at the end of the day there's a lot of people working

1242
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:40,060
very hard on this who are not a part of all of that who are just trying to do what they want to

1243
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:45,340
do for a living and that is make a fun video game and they're not a part of all that so it really

1244
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:53,140
sucks that you know all this other stuff brings it down but that also highlights the reason why a

1245
01:05:53,260 --> 01:06:05,820
figure like easy wall needs to go yeah if he really likes his employees he'll resign um let's

1246
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:11,460
see going yeah DJ Rama s and chat says friend of mine works at Ubisoft she helped worked on I'm

1247
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:16,420
gonna redact that just so that nobody can be identified I hope she doesn't have to deal with

1248
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:22,140
this BS I hope not either and again like I said hopefully there's many people within the company

1249
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,940
who again are just trying to make a good video game and see out their passion of designing video

1250
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:31,700
games for a living so it sucks that this has to exist from the company or that this exists within

1251
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:37,780
the company and that's why it is the responsibility of the management and the boardroom and the

1252
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:46,820
shareholders at this point to cut that out surgically without anesthesia it has gone on

1253
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:57,860
too long get in there get it out pod culture says fire them all and start over Mike deaf says

1254
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,620
Ubisoft but not really Ubisoft more like a subsidiary of them which I think would be game

1255
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:09,420
loft oh I think talking about something else sorry let's see Zen monkey says just do battle

1256
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:14,500
royale Assassin's Creed and call it a day Ubisoft likes to make their solo play games always online

1257
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:21,500
so why not Zen monkey says also Assassin's Creed should do what Grand Theft Auto 5 online is doing

1258
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,980
just do an online mode and milk it for a few years they honestly don't know what to do with

1259
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:35,420
those games um Grand Theft Auto 5 a few years 5 has been going on for it's it's gonna be a few

1260
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:42,940
decades by the time they pull the plug on that right Loki right yeah it's been eight years now

1261
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,660
or almost eight years it's they're not gonna pull the plug on that anytime soon I'm just

1262
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:52,860
razzing you and I obviously you had a great comment there I'm just poking fun Zen monkey

1263
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:59,620
says yeah more like a decade okay okay we agreed in let's speaking of decades and decades let's

1264
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:06,380
throw it back with our next story Dark Sakura so I don't know if anyone remembers this because it's

1265
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:14,740
been about 20 years rumored you know now but does anyone remember having heard of the SNK

1266
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:22,340
millennium it was supposed to be a console that SNK was working on in theory to complete with the

1267
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:32,620
Dreamcast and it had been mentioned around well the rumors came out around 1999 and there was

1268
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:41,380
even some mention of it you know that like a couple of statements that there was a home

1269
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:52,940
console SNK was working on but someone believes that they found a SNK motherboard that may have

1270
01:08:52,940 --> 01:09:00,300
belonged to what was becoming the system Anthony Bacon who runs a YouTube channel called video game

1271
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:09,020
esoterica did some digging with this PC motherboard and found that it was supposed to be the

1272
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:18,020
successor to the hyper neo geo 64 but it doesn't really do a whole lot it has like a very rudimentary

1273
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:25,860
BIOS that has the word zombie repeatedly in the code maybe that was like a a work name I guess

1274
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:35,420
work in progress project name but with this one yeah like the president of SNK at the time

1275
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:40,420
reference that they were working on the SNK millennium and there were some rumors in magazines

1276
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:50,420
it was going to license existing CPU technology married to a matrix graph graphics card anyway

1277
01:09:50,460 --> 01:10:04,700
what he has here is a board that is dated early 1998 and I'm just looking at some of the the

1278
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:11,740
pieces on it just to see what was those actually yeah this was writer right before they had to sell

1279
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:18,580
the rights to play more so anyway the board takes power doesn't do a lot else the BIOS

1280
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:25,060
has like a bunch of just gibberish in it except for the word zombies and plain text every so often

1281
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:31,540
but there's no games no files no software development kit no documentation if it runs

1282
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:41,340
they don't know what operating system it would run it does use a Hitachi sh4 CPU they think it

1283
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:48,380
might just you know run like a hello world message and then that's about it but it is though a nod

1284
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:56,100
back to an earlier portion of SNK's history so maybe maybe one day some information will come

1285
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:02,700
out about it maybe someone will step in and go hey I know what this is but right now all we have

1286
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:11,700
is a kind of a unworking motherboard yeah that's okay made this must have been pulled and stopped

1287
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:17,940
working on really really early on for this for so little to really exist on it but it is interesting

1288
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:23,820
to think you know well they were thinking that direction and maybe you know especially because

1289
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:28,500
you know consoles take so long to develop you know PlayStation Sony is working on PlayStation

1290
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:41,580
6 right now it's just you know it's just a matter of you know in 98 99 this would have been close to

1291
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:51,100
the time when the Dreamcast launched in Japan okay I mean because the the US release was in

1292
01:11:51,100 --> 01:12:02,540
99 September 99 99 yeah so it seems to me that they were really thinking ambitiously maybe ahead

1293
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:11,780
of themselves we know where that you know left the company ended up I mean I think that it's

1294
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:21,580
only more in recent years that SNK is you know done a pretty decent recovery right well we'll

1295
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:26,980
see what if maybe somebody will spill the deets on what was going on there and but probably sad

1296
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,940
we're never gonna see a game I bet I don't think it was really ready for that but you never know

1297
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:40,180
all right moving on let's talk about our next story Loki yes as if this was any surprise but

1298
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:49,340
we knew that once the acquisition of Bethesda by Microsoft happened that all exclusive deals with

1299
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:55,820
Bethesda titles on some platforms were definitely in question I know with like for example the next

1300
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:03,700
Elder Scrolls game that will be exclusive on the Xbox platforms as far as consoles go well now of

1301
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:10,140
course the one title that they're touting over and over Deathloop is only going to be exclusive on

1302
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:19,580
PlayStation for one year so September 14 2022 it'll be out on the Xbox platforms as well but at least

1303
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:31,100
they have that one year allegedly allegedly yes on game pass allegedly yeah so we'll see I'm not

1304
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:37,700
surprised really if that's the case well most of these exclusive agreements really are for just one

1305
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:43,140
year in fact you know kind of going to another Sony exclusive still for now that Final Fantasy

1306
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:48,940
7 remake I think many people expected that we would see that on Microsoft's platform now that

1307
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:54,620
it's been a year but then oh now we have the PlayStation 5 version and that you know you fee

1308
01:13:54,620 --> 01:14:01,260
DLC that possibly possibly extended the deal or something we don't really know you know we don't

1309
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:08,180
know all the ins and outs of how that worked but it's not on Xbox yet now that story doesn't involve

1310
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:14,580
a Microsoft own company like the Deathloop thing does now so I think it's all but certain Deathloop

1311
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:21,180
will show up on Xbox eventually but it is interesting to kind of hear the specifics on

1312
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:25,940
when you know and you got to wonder if that's gonna make some people wait I don't know I don't

1313
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,580
know you know do we know how many like PlayStation fives versus Xbox X's are out there I felt like I

1314
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,420
heard that there's more PlayStation fives but I don't know if that's just because it's adding

1315
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:40,740
Japan into it where we know Microsoft is a non factor like I don't know is it pretty even here

1316
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:46,860
in the u.s. or is PlayStation still ahead I don't yeah I have no idea honestly like I don't know and

1317
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:51,220
it's not really a factor for me though because we can't get PlayStation fives and there's yeah

1318
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:57,500
there's a handful of games that are exclusive on there that look pretty awesome but like I mean I

1319
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:02,980
was looking forward to the next Elder Scrolls game so I'm glad I have an Xbox why have PC too

1320
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,460
I guess I could definitely played on that but like you you do bring up an interesting point though

1321
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:13,700
where it's like that exclusive window kind of dwindles down when you consider that everybody

1322
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:21,260
who can't who wants a ps5 still can't get one and so it makes that window even smaller for when

1323
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:26,980
people finally do get a ps5 if you know what I mean true and then deathly balls is also gonna

1324
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:33,980
be available on PC so it's really just we're talking console exclusivity so if you want to

1325
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:39,300
play to me you can play it on PC as well and I guess to be fair series X's aren't exactly easy

1326
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:45,340
to come by either I'm my understanding is they are also having a hard time staying in stock and

1327
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,940
so forth and I think that's why my brain kind of goes I think they're selling more Playstations

1328
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:56,060
because I think they I think I just kind of I feel like most people that wanted an Xbox got one by

1329
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:02,220
now but I mean with games pass in the next cloud and stuff like that oh yeah yeah we have to

1330
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:07,180
remember Microsoft playing a different game now that's right yeah it's very true so I mean that

1331
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:14,740
so let's see what happens so I do want to take a small tangent and I did mention this in chat a

1332
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:20,700
little bit yeah sure I'm wondering how future acquisitions and mergers like this are going to

1333
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,100
go down under the new executive order who I haven't given it much thought I in fact it was

1334
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:34,380
the first thing I thought about when I saw the the buyouts and you know when the executive order

1335
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:38,900
was announced I was reading through it and I was like this is really gonna stop some of these big

1336
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:44,820
video game companies from acquiring the smaller guys just absorbing them I'm sure they'll find

1337
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:50,740
loopholes it's I mean they'll find loopholes I'm not familiar enough with the executive order to

1338
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,260
admittedly I heard that it was going on and I was I was certainly interested in the parts to talk

1339
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:58,580
about net neutrality and getting that back and everything but would it seemed like it was meant

1340
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,740
to close a lot of those loopholes that people have been getting through lately what if it was

1341
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:09,620
a Japanese company though that wouldn't it well it would affect business dealings in the US this

1342
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:17,180
is though I mean but Microsoft is a US company true true so it would certainly affect them I

1343
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:23,300
guess my brain goes to all those you know people that love to have those rumors about Microsoft's

1344
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,740
gonna buy a Japanese company with all these with all these buyouts they keep doing they're good

1345
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:34,660
they're gonna buy Konami you hear that you know way too often sure Konami would love someone to

1346
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:45,500
buy them but you know well so the other awesome thing though is the whole elimination of Internet

1347
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:51,380
cancellation fees and that one's really big for me mm-hmm so that they'll be better competition

1348
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:57,220
for internet providers so people can get basically access to better internet oh so companies can't

1349
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:03,900
lock you into two-year agreements anymore I think that it's it's if they do have a contract for it

1350
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:09,460
that the what they can charge you would be greatly reduced interesting and that they have to be a

1351
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:15,780
hundred percent transparent for each area what their services entail and all of the costs hmm

1352
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:24,220
I should read up on this I'm not you'd absolutely read up on it I'll find you the link yeah I also

1353
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:29,940
I also I also can Google I don't need I don't need I am one of those people who doesn't need

1354
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:34,980
someone else to Google it for me so I wanted to put a link in the chat anyway yeah fair enough

1355
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:40,460
all right okay let's move on let's talk about the next story which I'm sorry there's a misspelling

1356
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:45,660
there on the sidebar let's talk about The Witcher 3 not Wither 3 that's a different game

1357
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:54,900
that's how people feel in front of that actor withered okay so I was just making a pun all

1358
01:18:54,900 --> 01:19:02,260
right anyway so let's talk about Witcher 3 DLC yes Witcher 3 I think many of us thought that that

1359
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:07,340
game is done they're not going back to it why would they cyberpunk is the all the rage now so

1360
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:12,780
why would they go back to The Witcher 3 well guess what they are going back to The Witcher 3 they're

1361
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:18,140
going to be doing a free next-gen update later this year so that'll be kind of nice I imagine

1362
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,980
they're not gonna totally you know revamp everything but they'll probably just make

1363
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:26,620
it run a little better on the maybe better frame rate maybe some better textures or something

1364
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:34,260
lighting ray tracing maybe on the new consoles we'll see but this is all part of Witcher con they

1365
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:38,500
did announce that there will be a free next-gen updates that is kind of cool too is that you know

1366
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:43,060
because many of you probably picked up The Witcher 3 for like 20 bucks for everything or God maybe

1367
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:49,420
even cheaper at some point so it'll be a free upgrade and there's going to be DLC and it's

1368
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:56,380
going to also be free and it's going to be inspired by the Netflix version of the series

1369
01:19:56,380 --> 01:20:00,620
which is really about the books and not the games but they didn't say a little more about like what

1370
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:09,980
that's all gonna look like or whatever they just say ooh extra items hmm interesting so yeah and

1371
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:14,780
there's actually a whole little teaser thing that says The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt complete edition

1372
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:20,740
extra items inspired by the Netflix series with a little Netflix logo there so and then I think

1373
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:27,300
they also dated season two of the Netflix series for this fall at some point right sorry I didn't

1374
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,780
catch a specific date I'm sure somebody will shout it out in chat because they didn't really

1375
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:36,340
follow season one sorry it's on my to-do list so yeah there's lots of stuff and then they also have

1376
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:41,940
an anime that's coming to do they really I miss that yeah boy Netflix loves their video game

1377
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:46,900
anime don't they well again I guess witchers technically books but we know we know the video

1378
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:55,340
games helped that's for sure yeah I just wish the ingress anime was good yeah true you know I

1379
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:00,100
skipped an ingress event today to be here with y'all on the show just because it would have

1380
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:06,100
been appreciate your sacrifice yes thank you yes there was a thing in the Bay Area and I really

1381
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:11,980
wanted to go to get my badge tick but I didn't because I didn't want to miss the show actually

1382
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:18,500
I probably could have made the show but I didn't want to deal with the traffic to be honest so all

1383
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:25,060
right um DJ Rama S and chat says Rob speaking of anime did you watch Sanrio boys yet no I need to

1384
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:31,540
I need to I've seen y'all have sent me the pictures and everything I need to see it that's for sure

1385
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:39,700
and my deft Oh interesting also brings this up my deft brings up go that Pokemon go fest is next

1386
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:47,180
weekend and yeah that's a pretty big deal too I will be here for olr because thankfully they did

1387
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:57,620
that Sunday is just the raids and I'm less like needy on those as I am the Saturday stuff where

1388
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:02,060
they actually have all the different Pokemon and the collection challenges and all that they kind

1389
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:07,260
of made Sunday really a footnote but we're actually gonna drive into San Francisco on

1390
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:14,300
Saturday to play there because it'll only be like 60 some odd degrees in San Francisco on Saturday

1391
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,860
where it's here it's gonna be like in the 90s again so yeah so go fast to Saturday I'll be

1392
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:25,620
doing that but Sunday I'll be back in time for olr cuz I'm not gonna raid all day long so all right

1393
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:35,740
let's move on Dara Sagra sure so well hackers gonna hack people are gonna try to make profit

1394
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:43,260
off of whatever they can this a 27 year old guy in Japan was arrested after he was caught trying

1395
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:54,780
to sell modified Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild save files he was advertising them as quote

1396
01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:01,700
describing it as the strongest software and provide modded save files that would give players

1397
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:09,780
different improved abilities and difficult to obtain items the whatever the customer would

1398
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:18,820
request he was requesting 3500 yen about 31 bucks for this service and so it was spotted by the

1399
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:25,940
Niigata prefecture police and they arrested him on July 8th for violating the unfair competition

1400
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:32,660
prevention law and after he was arrested he admitted to selling more modded saves and

1401
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:40,460
software's in the past and that he had sold about 10 million yen about $90,000 in the last year and

1402
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:47,220
a half and well the judicial system in Japan is quite a bit different than it is here it's usually

1403
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:56,540
you're accused you're guilty that's how it works so like with very few exceptions so I don't know

1404
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:59,660
what's gonna happen with this guy he's gonna have to pay a lot of fines if he's actually gonna go

1405
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:09,100
to jail or what have you but hey don't don't do it don't sell modded files it's really not a new

1406
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:21,140
thing anyway I mean people have modified a video game software for ages there's more Nintendo

1407
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:31,100
actually used that law to sue a go-kart company in 2017 and a different man in Japan was arrested

1408
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:44,340
for selling cheats for Alliance of valiant arms an online shooter the the deputy director his name is

1409
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:49,940
Ozakawa he's of the cybercrime countermeasures division of the Niigata prefectural police he

1410
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:59,060
asked folks not to create sell or buy modified save data or software it's I mean here you

1411
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:04,340
wouldn't get a smackdown for it there it's a pretty big deal and like I said the judicial

1412
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:12,380
system is pretty tough yeah it is very interesting how that's something that is so frowned on there

1413
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:18,140
but here I don't I mean I don't know a lot of people that kind of like buy save files as it

1414
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:22,980
is I don't know if there's a huge market for that here I mean it's the internet whatever but yeah

1415
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:28,780
it's interesting how I mean it would have to be dealt with more of it in a civil manner here where

1416
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:34,380
Nintendo would take somebody to court for selling like modified versions or whatever like if that

1417
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:38,540
if that were something they were gonna even chase which they I don't think they really do unless

1418
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:46,620
they tack it on to something else so yeah and did your own ass and chat brings up oh yeah Mari

1419
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,780
car we talked about that on anime jam session shout out Tuesday nights yeah that's a little

1420
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:56,100
different though that's more of like you know stealing your intellectual property versus like

1421
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:01,100
I modified a game save I mean I guess I guess it's my intellectual property because it's a

1422
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:09,100
game safe but like yeah that's like it's the same law ridiculous same law though yeah so so if I if

1423
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:13,380
if just if I accuse them then they're guilty right so then I'm just gonna accuse them of

1424
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:22,700
perpetuating joy-con drift then where's my billions of dollars you'd really need to look

1425
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:28,100
there's actually a really good documentary about prisons in Japan that talks a lot about the

1426
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,500
prosecution that if something actually goes to a prosecution you're pretty much gonna get put away

1427
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:42,020
hmm all right well let's move on to something that may end up in a court somewhere Loki

1428
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:50,060
yeah so this is interesting there's a brand new set of like cheap programs or software or

1429
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:55,020
something like that that this cheat maker is basically saying is undetectable on consoles

1430
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:01,620
and PC the reason it's undetectable it's at least that's what they're alleging is because

1431
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:09,980
it actually involves like a separate PC so basically taking video from your console or

1432
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:17,580
your PC and then kind of running that through a separate PC with this program that then I guess

1433
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:25,780
adjust I don't know if it's I would assume it's connected to your input somehow but it allows

1434
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:34,060
they basically to do all the aim botting and stuff like that via AI and machine learning and stuff

1435
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:44,060
like that so interesting of course the game that they're promoting with this right now is Call of

1436
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:52,060
Duty and you know Activision is not having that so they actually were advertising this on YouTube

1437
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:59,780
and they've taken the ad down now it's been struck with a copyright claim by Activision Publishing

1438
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:08,140
so yeah I can only imagine this is gonna end well but it is they're building better cheat software

1439
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:13,900
you know they're getting around stuff like that it stuff like that is gonna be harder to detect

1440
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:21,260
especially when it's not directly modifying the console it's basically like an in-between the

1441
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:32,060
console and you know the player so good luck yeah but it's like I can I give the YouTube and

1442
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:37,860
copyright strike stuff a lot of shit because it's it's way overused and it never is seems to be on

1443
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:42,860
the side of the creators but I'll give them this one like that's a pretty clever way to get the

1444
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:47,940
ad down for you know your game which you know again if you're gonna use these aim bot things

1445
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,140
and you're using if you're using them in multiplayer environments like Call of Duty

1446
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:58,380
I'm sorry you're the bad person here not Activision not YouTube you're the bad person here if you're

1447
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:02,580
using them in single-player mode go off I don't give a fuck do whatever you want to do in

1448
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:07,860
single-player mode it's when you use this stuff to intentionally try to grief other people or get a

1449
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:13,700
leg up on something that to feel like you're good at something when you're not and you're just

1450
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:17,740
cheating and everybody knows you're cheating and the more you get up the ladder the more that

1451
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:23,460
that shit always comes out at the end of the day always comes out at the end of the day yes it

1452
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:28,900
especially when you see like you know streamers and stuff like that getting caught with some of

1453
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:36,100
this stuff it's it's ridiculous but yeah I don't I don't get the point of cheating to make it way

1454
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:40,980
up a ladder to brag about how good you are the game because you you're not suck at the game you

1455
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:46,980
suck at it you're quite bad yeah I think these people they just can't really they don't really

1456
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:52,780
care they just know I know but but I beat you so you're just mad you know like yeah cry more

1457
01:29:52,780 --> 01:30:00,260
cry more nerd yeah that whole thing exactly yeah it's it's silly yeah I mean you know there's

1458
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:05,540
people in you know the online game obviously dark soccer and I both I'm in both play wait

1459
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:11,740
way too much of his dead by daylight and I see hackers in that game once in a great while but

1460
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:17,540
I don't I don't give them the kindness of a reaction I give them a swift right-click block

1461
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:24,420
I don't want to see this bitch again that's what that's it for me so all right yeah Alan had a

1462
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:32,100
match yesterday where there were seven people in the match somehow yeah okay so I've seen videos

1463
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:39,500
of like there was there was a thing going on for a little while where people were getting two

1464
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:49,780
killers that's wild is this was I think a couple of releases ago but I was in fact as I think I was

1465
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:58,660
seeing this on like a polyester video hmm where they were trying to figure out which killer had

1466
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:05,740
the act of terror radius because only one of them did but both were affected by survivor actions

1467
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:10,020
it was really crazy but this is actually a glitch but I think that there's something in there that

1468
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:16,900
people have been exploiting yeah and I want no part of that like again if you're just gonna cheat

1469
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:24,980
at a game like congrats you did nothing like you just you just wasted everybody's time congratulations

1470
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:30,780
including yours yeah all right all right let's move on while dark soccer continues to give us

1471
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:36,060
kiddie shots let's move on and talk about one more story here before we get into our classic of the

1472
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:40,820
week will you can see there on the side that maybe we're doing something special tonight but we'll

1473
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:47,660
get into that in a minute first we'll talk about Atari why not let's talk about who how many out

1474
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:55,900
there got your Atari VCS no exactly but anyway that you see I've already got a PC so I didn't

1475
01:31:55,900 --> 01:32:00,900
buy one well guess what Atari is gonna be getting even more into PC stuff because Atari is said that

1476
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:05,340
they are going to be getting away from mobile gaming a little bit this is a recent report from

1477
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:12,540
games industry dot biz a statement by the new CEO Wade Rosen of Atari says quote our intent with give

1478
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:17,620
with any gaming experiences to provide accessible and joyful moments of meaningful play that's

1479
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:22,380
the core of Atari and what binds our history with our future to that end we feel that premium

1480
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:28,220
gaming is better representative of this type of gaming experience and the Atari DNA so they're

1481
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:33,100
going to be reducing the free-to-play mobile gaming stuff and concentrate instant on premium

1482
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:39,540
PC and console gaming of course I we get like a new IP Atari I mean because like honestly they've

1483
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:45,380
just been re-releasing their old stuff I'll take to death I'll take new games out of the old stuff

1484
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:53,480
if they're good like right well I take a castle crystal castles like remade hell yeah but it

1485
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:59,180
better be awesome you know there be ray-traced crystal castles I want to shine in those crystals

1486
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:04,100
hell yeah exactly see that would be fun crystal castles I bet would make kind of an awesome

1487
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:12,060
platformer type of game but what do I know anyway I guess there's let's see they're gonna sell or

1488
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:17,860
shut down some of their mobile IPs including roller coaster tycoon stories crystal castles

1489
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:24,500
I guess is on mobile I didn't even know that Atari combat tank theory and ninja golf didn't know that

1490
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:28,420
wasn't it I guess that's one of those new IPs you can look forward to from Atari I don't think

1491
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:35,940
no it is like the game was very good ninja golf was on this the 70 70 800 oh wow okay it was a

1492
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:41,220
joke gone bad all right I didn't know it even dated back there Wow all right no word on the

1493
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:47,660
Atari hotel though I'm still waiting on that one there is that by the way since we brought up Atari

1494
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:55,700
y'all want to bring up in television sure it's been an interesting thing here's the thing so

1495
01:33:55,700 --> 01:34:03,180
they've had an interesting week on Twitter because Tommy's Tommy likes to talk and he'll of course

1496
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:10,260
talk about top CEO of in television and now in the amico and all that stuff and he's he's kind of

1497
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:16,620
he's cooked himself a little bit on Twitter by engaging in conversations he probably shouldn't

1498
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:21,780
be having and he kind of knows this so look I'm gonna I'm gonna make this long story short not

1499
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:26,740
that I think that Tommy listens to this show but I also kind of believe if you say his name three

1500
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:32,420
times in the mirror he does have a tendency to show up to defend the amico so I will I will try

1501
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,380
to risk here and here's my honest-to-god advice with Tommy and I'm not this isn't to like knock

1502
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:42,340
him or anything we've had him on this show before I think he's a fascinating interviewer I think he

1503
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:47,820
really are a fascinating interviewee I think he really believes in the product I I still I'm I

1504
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:54,380
pre-ordered that amico I'm interested in it I'm curious what it's gonna do my honest advice though

1505
01:34:54,380 --> 01:35:01,460
in television needs to have some more spokespeople and not just one because when you put everything

1506
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:07,900
in the hands of one person that's when things can make or break for everybody if you know what

1507
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:13,460
I mean right look at a company like Nintendo Nintendo didn't just have Reggie Fils-Aime

1508
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:19,700
or intent Nintendo had Satoru Iwata rest in peace by the way I believe today is the anniversary of

1509
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:28,780
his passing if I'm not mistaken Nintendo had Miyamoto Nintendo had other vote now they have

1510
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:34,860
Doug Bowser of course Nintendo has Nintendo also has Sakurai you know and I you know and all that

1511
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:40,300
and the memes the great memes of please do not ask me for this again a good gaming company has

1512
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:45,860
lots of different spokespeople to promote the product and I think this is something in television

1513
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:51,980
if the events of the past week and everything I think really shows they really need that and if

1514
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:58,380
Tommy's not willing to have that I think that's and here's the thing I'm sure the response would

1515
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:04,060
be something like but but but we have these developers over here we have this over and this

1516
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:11,580
goes back to one of our big golden rules here at OLR and that is the truth doesn't matter it's

1517
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:16,460
what's perceived that matters and there's only one person out there doing interviews on Amico

1518
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:24,700
right now as far as we can all see so my strong advice get some other people out there to really

1519
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:32,700
show that this system is for more than one person all right anyhow let's Oh see dark to see you says

1520
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,700
I do love the ideas he was bringing to the table yeah I'm not knocking the system or anything like

1521
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:43,580
ice I and I do think when he argues you should try it before you knock it I think that is a fair

1522
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:50,980
request 100% and I I completely agree there's probably a lot of youtubers out there who want

1523
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:56,260
to see this thing fail who have no intention of ever trying it or giving it a chance which again

1524
01:36:56,260 --> 01:37:05,500
hurts developers at the end of the day so again that's why my my suggestion is show more of those

1525
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:11,900
people show some of these other people contributing to this system success and I think maybe you'll

1526
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:16,860
get a different result a little bit there but dark to see it does agree everything that I'm

1527
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:22,460
saying tire con chat says in television needs a PR agent unfortunately they probably have one but

1528
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,660
it's also one of those things where it's like sometimes you hire the person that lets you do

1529
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:35,980
whatever you want hmm right yeah like such as I'm sorry I'm sorry to bring this individual up but

1530
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:41,020
such as our former president you know he only hired people and surrounded that we're gonna

1531
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:49,340
agree to everything you wanted anyway well until they absolutely couldn't yeah and until finally

1532
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:55,580
you know it was all taken away but anyway let's move on let's let's move on to another let's let's

1533
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:59,980
look back on fonder times let's go way way way back and look on some fonder times in our next

1534
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:17,380
segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull

1535
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:29,020
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of something special it is a lot

1536
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:36,860
more special and it is indeed a very special game we're doing a flag which is the fucking weird

1537
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:45,460
arcade game and this one and I'm actually encompassing two together they're ones at sequel

1538
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:55,660
but the game is called Sonic blast man and then the sequel Sonic blast heroes and I'm bringing up

1539
01:38:55,700 --> 01:39:05,580
specifically the arcade version because the arcade version is the weird one so basically you have a

1540
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:16,460
setup where it's you've got this target in front of you that you punch and you punch it at certain

1541
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:22,740
intervals in the game imagine like a reverse punch mania I guess for people who have actually played

1542
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:36,540
a punch mania so it's you basically are playing a superhero and you have different well different

1543
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:43,580
rescues that you have to perform and so you have to basically hit the enemies and different targets

1544
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:51,260
and you in each target has a number of tons of resistance and so once you've depleted that ton

1545
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:58,220
of resistance they'll be defeated so you have a pair of gloves and this mechanical punch pad so

1546
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:04,100
you have to wear the gloves and punch strongly enough to deal the damage only three hits are

1547
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:13,340
allowed so you have five stages and then they're like mostly typical rescuing of people scenarios

1548
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:22,100
you have a woman who is being assaulted by a thug you have a baby carriage pushed into the middle of

1549
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:29,900
the freeway by accident and that a truck will run over an armed group that takes control of the

1550
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:34,860
building and is now the center of operations you have a giant crab terrorizing a cruise ship and

1551
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:42,420
an asteroid that's set to crash into the earth now an interesting thing about this and if you're

1552
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:55,820
watching the the video this is a words this one is a sonic blast heroes that we're watching but

1553
01:40:55,820 --> 01:41:03,140
it the in 1995 the original was recalled because of players who sustained injuries by playing the

1554
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:09,420
game and then the Consumer Product Safety Commission said that Taito had to pay a fine

1555
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:16,300
a fifty thousand US dollars for failing to disclose the injuries and of course what we're

1556
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:26,740
seeing here is that we are looking at now the the the official sequel sonic blast heroes with

1557
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:31,740
new touched-up graphics and you know that's basically still the same the same kind of game

1558
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:42,660
so it did get a console release and who knows maybe this will get its own classic game segment

1559
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:52,060
but it came out on the SNES as a beat-em-up and in this one you have to save earth from different

1560
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:58,460
kinds of forces like street gangs and terrorists and aliens and robots and evil clone called heavy

1561
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:09,020
blast man and it's a one player only I mean it's a beat-em-up there are also bonus levels that are

1562
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:16,620
adaptations of the arcade version so since there's no like punch pad for strength you have to repeat

1563
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:27,020
repeatedly rotate the d-pad it was it was definitely censored for the u.s. in Japan you

1564
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:36,300
had female enemies in the u.s. you did not and it actually had a sequel as well on SNES sonic

1565
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:44,540
blast man to you with different player characters that you had so actually there is the actual

1566
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:51,420
sequel to sonic blast man is called it's more like a spiritual sequel called real puncher very

1567
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:57,660
similar to the original game that has like a photo mode for the places for the faces of people in

1568
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:06,460
each of the levels and it was released outside the side of Japan as a ticket redemption game so so

1569
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:12,100
yes and then there's the other sequel so yeah there were more than one sequel so sonic blast

1570
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:21,700
heroes was announced in 2010 in February and it hit the arcades around the same time and outside

1571
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:31,340
of Japan it was called real puncher 2 and that's it weird-ass game they should make a one punch

1572
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:40,620
band spin off of this game they should I mean it would fit since but for him you could only get one

1573
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:47,020
punch you've got timing yeah I I apologize as I ran away to the restroom while you're talking

1574
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:52,100
about this game but if you have you actually played this game out of curiosity this one yeah

1575
01:43:52,100 --> 01:44:03,940
yes nice what I feel like I've seen it and it hurt my wrist oh no all right all right well there

1576
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:10,380
it is your plan oh go ahead and to answer gg around my ass and I don't know if he sent this

1577
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:15,740
comment before I read that it was um wasn't sonic blast man one of the first games for super

1578
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:23,460
Nintendo and yeah and that's the one I was talking about it was pretty early for the system it wasn't

1579
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:26,980
one of my favorites to play out of the end of the beat em up so I was more of a final fight person

1580
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:34,820
but it wasn't bad and I was glad that they could at the time that I played it I didn't know that it

1581
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:44,340
was an arcade game I got to play one at it was at some little indie arcade that happened to have

1582
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:50,900
one and then like I hurt myself after I played it and I decided not to play it again the end

1583
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:58,340
all right we'll keep those flags coming that was a fun one so yeah there it is your classic flag

1584
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:06,500
of the month all right a pair a pair a matching pair this this month all right let's get in excuse

1585
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:12,940
me hiccups let's get into our rapid-fire news segment here I have some coffee brewing so I'm

1586
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:19,340
gonna go grab that so let's get right to Loki and some rapid-fire news so Pokemon go is making lots

1587
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:26,340
of money they've ranked are rigged in so far five billion dollars since launch so I'd say the game

1588
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:32,020
successful I guess or maybe it's dead you know Pokemon goes dead that's what really we should be

1589
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:40,500
taken away from this and then there was a new world or a couple of world records set for a

1590
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:51,540
collection of old retro I guess LCD games so Linda Gilroy's she's got two different records

1591
01:45:51,540 --> 01:46:00,020
for one for having a collection of almost 1600 LCD gaming systems which is pretty awesome and

1592
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:06,740
then also two thousand four hundred and thirty playable gaming systems so I'm assuming consoles

1593
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:16,700
outside of that she's uh she's got more than love than Jamie's vault there so no I don't know

1594
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:27,820
where's your world record for that but yeah so it's pretty cool to see the collection that she

1595
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:32,860
has they have a video on YouTube about it and stuff so definitely worth checking out but yeah

1596
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:39,660
those LCD games are pretty awesome group on that stuff so yeah I remember playing a I used to have

1597
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:46,340
a Castlevania to Simon's Quest LCD game not as old as some of the like relaxing and stuff that

1598
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:53,980
they're showing but fun stuff I used to love those LCD games I don't think I owned a lot of them

1599
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:58,940
myself but I love those games and that's an impressive I didn't even know they made that

1600
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,260
many of them so very impressive collection we just have to collect all those little mini

1601
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:07,740
cabs now they can get a world record for that yeah I'm sure somebody's got me beat there

1602
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:13,140
because there's too many of them now like somebody sent me a little um like it's like the tiny arcade

1603
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:17,540
and it was like I was Hello Kitty pac-man or something like that and as neat as it looked

1604
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:21,700
those really really tiny ones that are almost like keychain size they're not my favorite but

1605
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:28,740
I guess when you're collecting things you still want them all you know so you know so because I

1606
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:34,620
have a few of them so but yeah I didn't I didn't want to go seek out one of these Hello Kitty ones

1607
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:38,980
but I like like the one that Alan got me a few weeks ago live on the show you know they're they're

1608
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:47,100
pretty impressive now yeah the Galaga tabletop arcade went up oh really I don't know you guys

1609
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:52,700
got yeah I think we got it like way dirt cheap you probably when when Loki was on here going

1610
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:56,780
there 50 bucks at Walmart right now you probably jumped on one of those yeah I think Dan got it

1611
01:47:56,780 --> 01:48:03,940
somewhere else but but yeah it was it's pretty cool that's awesome yeah I'm hoping I'll have

1612
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:10,580
some more space soon to expand those a little bit but I'll talk about that later all right let's

1613
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:14,940
move on and travel around the world and check out some really oh I'm sorry we've been I'm sorry no

1614
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:23,900
we need to do dark soccer's rapid-fire news then we do really dark soccer yeah that's okay um so

1615
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:33,340
there is these pictures have been posted of an Animal Crossing monopoly and I mean it looks

1616
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:42,700
pretty legit I mean it's got all the right stuff on the boxes it said that it was I mean some people

1617
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:50,940
are saying that it's a rumor but I mean apparently Hasbro released one but Nintendo Hasbro or

1618
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:58,340
Nintendo hasn't said anything about it yet there is a list for the game on Zato games UK website

1619
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:05,380
for it but the reddit user that talked about it posted some pictures of the game and so we have

1620
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:13,140
like Isabel inside the box welcome to your deserted island getaway and it has the cards

1621
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:18,980
has a little punch outs for bells and coins and fruit and fossils you have four little figures

1622
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:27,300
which there's only one girl and she's wearing pink which is terrible but the box looks really

1623
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:37,060
cute the the back of it looks really cute I mean it seems fairly likely so I guess that you're

1624
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:47,100
using your your fossils and whatnot little tokens instead of houses and whatnot so oh yeah probably

1625
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:55,340
yeah SSG 100 Matt suggests is mr. Resetti jail you know I didn't look hold on because I'm gonna

1626
01:49:55,340 --> 01:50:00,580
look at the I'm looking at the play field no they know they he's not on there they cheaped

1627
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:07,020
out by having just the traditional go-to-jail thing but it really should have been poor

1628
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:13,060
Resetti yeah he really got a raw deal in this latest he's traumatized an entire series of

1629
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:22,180
childhoods you know yeah and I love him for it mm-hmm so the other story here there you know we

1630
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:26,780
we've every so often brought up different unopened games we have an unopened Legend

1631
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:34,460
of Zelda from 1997 and it does look like it's a gold cartridge sold for 87 hunt no sorry for

1632
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:43,460
eight hundred seventy thousand dollars and of course heritage auctions in Dallas put the is

1633
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:51,540
what hosted the sale and the same auction house is the same one that sold the unopened copy of

1634
01:50:51,540 --> 01:51:01,740
Super Mario Brothers that someone forgotten his desk drawer since 1986 but yeah I mean if you

1635
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:06,140
maybe I should never have removed the shrink shrink wrap from my copy of guitar ooh man

1636
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:18,980
maybe we should sell an NFT of episode one let's do it well so we'll sell just enough so that we

1637
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:23,820
can get pizza that's probably that's probably how much it would ultimately go for would just

1638
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:30,500
buy a pizza maybe two we should hey if someone buys us a pizza we'll give you the first episode

1639
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:39,940
no no no no I'm kidding I do not send you do not we'll send you a screenshot from the old webcam

1640
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:49,540
you are not Homer Simpson and you are not selling the show for a forbidden donut I'm joking I mean

1641
01:51:49,540 --> 01:52:00,460
like just like an audio clip I'm like audio clips that would be NFT worthy but I forbid those from

1642
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:06,980
ever happening did your MS says you can actually do that it's called treat stream no we're not

1643
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:11,900
we're not getting any NFT business I don't until until it makes sense to me we're not getting into

1644
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:23,860
that you want to really impress us get people to listen to the show I'll sell a pair of my

1645
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:29,940
socks for like a good pizza I'm so excited for conventions to come back so I can actually like

1646
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:34,980
tell people about this show again that'd be very nice we can maybe get some more listeners well

1647
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:45,060
um next year though I mean I'm planning a derpy con and and dragon con although I really want to

1648
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:51,140
do twitch con now oh yeah twitch con would be a lot oh my god twitch con would be off the hook I

1649
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:56,300
really now I really want to do that yeah yeah I doubt it's gonna happen this year because that

1650
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:01,900
would be a little soon because yeah that usually that was in like October November I think and I

1651
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:07,220
think we would have heard by now if they plan on doing that but yeah 2022 for sure that'd be great

1652
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:13,820
and I know some local cons are starting back up like there's gonna be a I think there's a sinister

1653
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:19,940
con out in Roseville in August and I'll probably just show up say hey I don't think I'm doing it

1654
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:28,020
official capacity there but November 14th is glitch con oh where's that at it's online okay

1655
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:37,900
yeah nice let's see pod culture says trying to suss out how to get that click out which I think

1656
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:42,540
is actually a response to editing a particular past episode of our show but I think it's a good

1657
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:47,180
we're trying to suss out and get the click out that is exactly what we're trying to do for OLR

1658
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:56,660
as well so I read it anyway there it is Carlos spanak topia a spin spin a copita sorry I'm

1661
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:15,780

1662
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:25,220
good the DC one is DC which which DC one twitchcon no I think just maybe a convention I don't cuz I

1716
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:44,940
but basically the developer Miguel Cerber has been rushing to finish it because he had heard

1717
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:53,380
a rumor said it's gonna be switched off in 2021 but basically saying that you know right now it's

1718
02:00:53,380 --> 02:01:00,380
kind of a passion project of his to get it translated but yeah I don't know where the

1719
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:07,740
July 20th date necessarily gets mentioned here but I do know that at least he's trying to rush

1720
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:12,820
to get it done but that's the rumor date for right now so we'll have to see what happens with that

1721
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:18,540
you know wasn't this the whole wasn't this the whole thing like about a year ago that Sony was

1722
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:23,380
threatening to close down this store in the PlayStation 3 store and people really were up

1723
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:29,460
in arms about it because there wouldn't be a way to play a lot of those classics if the store goes

1724
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:34,580
down there's still a lot on PlayStation 3 you can't get anywhere else so it's interesting that

1725
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:41,700
this is coming back now yeah I'm still trying to like the developer doesn't necessarily mention

1726
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:50,300
the July 20th date so I'm just trying to figure out where they get that from so I don't know but

1727
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:59,260
we'll see we'll see what happens it's not that long from now all right well a game I never shut

1728
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:03,700
up about here on OLR is Final Fantasy 14 and I never shut up about it because I really enjoy it

1729
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:08,700
I don't know if I enjoy it this much but I bet other people do to the extent that they would buy

1730
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:15,140
a cookbook based on Final Fantasy 14 it's interesting the cookbook is for 14 and not 15 15

1731
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:21,860
yeah exactly but to be I kind of think there already is one for 15 to be honest what so there

1732
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:28,620
is that going on so yeah a Final Fantasy 14 cookbook was spotted and I guess it was named

1733
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:33,780
something a little bit more generic but some digging from good old warrior of 64 on Twitter

1734
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:39,700
found out that this book is slated to launch on November 9th 2021 it has a forward written by

1735
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:45,500
Naoki Ishida and it's gonna cost about $35 of course we don't know what recipes if popoto soup

1736
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:51,780
or whatever are going to be in there but I guess stay tuned for all the details on that sometimes

1737
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:56,300
these things come with like a special code for an in-game item as well and that'll make it more

1738
02:02:56,340 --> 02:03:00,980
desirable this was also a reminder to myself to bring up the benchmark that just came out over

1739
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:04,580
the weekend for Endwalker but I already talked about that earlier in the show so I guess I don't

1740
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:09,780
need to say that again but dark soccer this might be something that interests you maybe maybe I mean

1741
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:16,980
I like I like video game cookbooks a whole lot so it is a it is a fun little niche right like it's

1742
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:23,500
like not something you see a lot but it's kind of funny when it's there so no one special 77 in

1743
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:30,180
chat says if it isn't in the cookbook there should be a recipe for KFC Kentucky fried chocobo not

1744
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:35,220
funny anyway fifth dream says who wrote the cookbook I was helping the author of the Wow

1745
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:42,340
cookbook the GOT cookbook gather recipes from 14 and 15 but nothing came of it yet she wrote a

1746
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:47,380
Star Wars cookbook too I don't have the name in front of me I'm sorry I cuz I don't know if I

1747
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:52,140
think it's they're finding figuring this all out from the Amazon description for an untitled

1748
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:56,580
project so I don't know if they actually know who the author of it is yet but that would be

1749
02:03:56,580 --> 02:04:07,180
really interesting if the same person so all right let's move on dark soccer so I'm saying

1750
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:13,540
this with with the hope that we don't get into the big police discussion but it is going to touch

1751
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:21,500
on it so I'm leaving a trigger warning for that right now so there the the New York Police

1752
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:27,140
Department is rolling out this thing called a game truck they've already done it once but they want

1753
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:34,940
us there there say their goal is to connect with youth particularly in low-income neighborhoods so

1754
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:44,620
they said it's like a like an olive branch of sorts to sort of repair a relationship because

1755
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:53,340
there's been so much deserved mistrust so the chief of community affairs for the department

1756
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:58,580
has said and I'm just gonna read the the quote we're coming to your block we're coming out to

1757
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:03,260
your neighborhood make sure our young people have a safe summer a safe place and know that

1758
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:11,620
NYPD is here to support them so the truck has different gaming consoles including switches

1759
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:18,060
ps5s Xbox Series X and they just want to connect to the young people that's what they said it's

1760
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:24,260
painted with various Marvel characters and the word NYPD game truck I don't know what comic book

1761
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:27,740
characters really have to do with video games apart from there being video games that contain

1762
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:32,940
comic book characters but whatever you know that's when you let non gamers decide you know

1763
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:45,820
do your marketing well it was free candy anyway they're they're saying that this is trying to

1764
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:51,700
engage with the youth for extracurricular activities the first truck was spotted over

1765
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:58,340
the July 4th weekend in the north end of Manhattan's East River Park near several of

1766
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:04,500
the New York City Housing Authority buildings there's another truck in Bushwick neighborhood

1767
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:14,220
it there now here's what the critics are saying is that there are people who want to think that

1768
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:20,320
this is well-intentioned but it's another reflection and it's actually stated by

1769
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:29,780
oleami olorian has a public defender with the Legal Aid Society not AIDS but Aid Society that

1770
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:36,180
they try to intertwine themselves into the communities quote it's really it's really

1771
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:40,420
just another means of indoctrinating people into believing the police are necessary and have to be

1772
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:45,500
around and it's another way in which the same communities are forced to have constant police

1773
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:57,860
presence end quote there's also some practices they like for example in 2018 they were questioning

1774
02:06:57,860 --> 02:07:03,540
a 12 year old boy suspected of committing a felony they gave him a soda from McDonald's the

1775
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:09,700
interview was over the boy was let to go but they recovered the straw and entered his DNA into a

1776
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:17,220
database it didn't link him to any crimes the family had to petition a court to have it removed

1777
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:23,700
but I mean they're breaking laws so they're thinking that because of incidents like this

1778
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:36,220
that they might be using these kids going into the the vans or whatever as a means to collect

1779
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:44,620
DNA another quote by Marianne Kyshian who is a senior policy counsel with Brooklyn Defender

1780
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:51,460
Services her quote says for decades the NYPD has aggressively sought to target and serve survey

1781
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:57,620
New Yorkers particularly young black and brown people and to harvest and catalog their DNA in

1782
02:07:57,620 --> 02:08:06,300
the secretive internal archives such as the gang database and rogue DNA database it it may seem a

1783
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:14,220
little bit what's what I'm thinking of almost conspiracy theory is except the fact that they

1784
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:22,300
have done it before they're over survey survey doing over surveillance basically taking up some

1785
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:35,380
predatory practices at least according to a lot of people NYPD didn't respond to any requests for

1786
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:45,500
comments on this and none of the associated facilities have but there was I mean but it was

1787
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:52,700
you know said by at the time the chief of detectives German Shay night in 2018 that there

1788
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:58,980
is the NYPD criminal group database or quote gang database that was made up of 99% non-white people

1789
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:04,140
particularly black and Latino young men with children as young as 13 years old being added

1790
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:14,940
into it so there is definitely precedent for it however I'm going to go on the fence with this

1791
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:24,660
one I think that it is a well intentioned plan you know and I think trust does need to be rebuilt

1792
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:32,340
but I think they have to earn that trust you know they have to do more to earn the trust and I don't

1793
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:38,940
think putting out a truck with video games to get some kids into play is gonna do it they need to be

1794
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:45,020
massive overhauls yep I'm gonna I'm gonna just say agree and I'm gonna read some chat comments

1795
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:50,060
that I think are pretty please please read Ron was our yeah our New York fam is lighting up on this

1796
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:55,740
so yes of course I'll start with Rama so Rama says so let me say this since I live in NYC and

1797
02:09:55,740 --> 02:10:01,940
I'm a targeted person lol I think this is a good idea because the NYPD does have community

1798
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:06,900
initiatives some are saying that this is a trap to suss out gang members I don't defend the NYPD

1799
02:10:06,940 --> 02:10:13,780
but I feel they're trying we just need better people in the NYPD to help with this I want to

1800
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:18,700
read SHO 100 Matt's comment as well basically you got to go a long way to gaining trust in

1801
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:23,980
communities gaming truck is nice and all but you got to have decades of trust to regain for some

1802
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:29,060
folks and that's kinda that's kind of where my head is out with it is I and I think the the

1803
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:34,380
well-intentioned part is is accurate it's one of those it's a especially when you paint Marvel

1804
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:38,700
characters on the side of it and somebody in Chad had also said how do you do fellow kids with that

1805
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:45,180
whole thing yeah there is a part of me that kind of like gold star you tried you get the you tried

1806
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:51,780
start you it's well-intentioned you tried but it doesn't address the real issues it makes me think

1807
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:59,300
of I'm gonna put it this way imagine you have a diabetic foot with neck necrotic tissue on it

1808
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:04,700
now imagine just putting a band-aid and send me a spore and on it that's what this feels like to

1809
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:09,060
me you might feel better for a little bit and that one little part might get a little bit better but

1810
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:14,540
there's still a big festering necrotic wound underneath it that needs to well and when you

1811
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:21,220
get to that point you need to cut some things out of it and replace things with good good tissue or

1812
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:27,100
packaging or you know prosthetics at that point that's my thought about it is that it might not

1813
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:37,860
be enough you've got to get and I know this is very broad and generalized you need to get the the

1814
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:43,900
damaged tissue removed you need to remove the people who are going along with it who are

1815
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:50,620
silencing others and are focusing on their own personal gain and personal power and we need to

1816
02:11:50,620 --> 02:12:00,140
bring back a police that is held accountable and also fairly holds itself accountable so that's my

1817
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:07,300
two cents on it this is this is a very small this is a little bit of gauze and Neosporin where what

1818
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:16,980
you need is like debridement and yeah um deejirama s in chat saying basically agreeing with what you

1819
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:21,660
said but also wanting to say Marvel is popular and Marvel is in NYC so in a way it does make

1820
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:27,500
sense that way all right I'll give you that bonds 006 was to chime in to saying also living here in

1821
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:32,660
NYC Rama and I can speak volumes I have literally seen one of those gaming trucks six doors down

1822
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:40,980
from my door right across a basketball court and slash school building interesting and Rama wanted

1823
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:45,860
to add we'll get one more comment here from Rama and then we'll move on saying and I grew up in the

1824
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:50,620
projects you know the bad part of town the parts of town where the cops are a lot which causes a

1825
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:56,740
lot of these issues all I can say is that you have to live here to understand it so yeah but even if

1826
02:12:56,740 --> 02:13:02,140
you can you can listen to people as well and learn some stuff from the people that are there

1827
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:09,580
and stuff that's why y'all's comments please bear in mind that Marvel is a lot more than just the

1828
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:16,300
films where they're filmed has nothing to do with the comics all right just saying um let's go ahead

1829
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:22,180
and move on to our next story because this is uh this is one of those things where I'm like wow

1830
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:27,940
but also not surprised Loki I don't know how to set this up for you but it's all I have to say

1831
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:35,900
is the word is de nouveau and so you know it makes sense that one we had a cracking group called

1832
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:41,820
Empress remove the DRM including Dean nouveau from Resident Evil 8 they're doing the Lord's work

1833
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:49,300
it not only allowed them to play it without DRM but also allowed them to play without the

1834
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:57,220
stuttering issues that they've been having in the game since back in May and apparently like all the

1835
02:13:57,220 --> 02:14:03,260
game in-game stutters when you kill zombies or whatever been fixed because cap comes DRM entry

1836
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:08,180
points have been patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore this results

1837
02:14:08,180 --> 02:14:16,980
in a much smoother gameplay experience like that that's a problem when your DRM causes performance

1838
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:22,660
in game and the pirates are having a better game experience than your actual paid customers that's

1839
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:33,100
how you that's how you get more pirates Capcom so maybe cut it out yeah this this whole thing speaks

1840
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:37,620
volumes you know and I can't stop laughing at dark soccer saying they're doing the Lord's work

1841
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:43,580
but in a way they are because it's one of those things where if the game runs better without it

1842
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:49,620
it just encourages people to look into these types of things that perhaps they would have wouldn't

1843
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:55,300
have looked into otherwise that's bad especially if Capcom can't lock that shit up now like now

1844
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:59,860
then this story is just gonna spread and people are gonna see this headline oh how do I get

1845
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:08,060
Resident Evil 8 to run better on my system oh I just steal it I see this is not a great situation

1846
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:14,340
for Capcom and it's a really not great thing for due to ovo or whatever but people need to stop new

1847
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:22,060
oh yeah new vote to get get out oh that's I it's it's terrible and I know we've never heard a good

1848
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:28,180
story about it look I understand that companies want to protect their shit and I do not endorse

1849
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:36,540
piracy here but when this types of stuff happens it is very embarrassing for all these companies

1850
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:42,100
that it's like it's it's so obviously shines a spotlight on what the flaw is in the game when

1851
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:46,300
it's impacting performance like that yeah and we're not seeing that people are pirating the

1852
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:52,660
game necessarily with the cracked version you can crack a paid version as well and you know if your

1853
02:15:52,660 --> 02:16:00,620
consumer that wants to play the game you know not broken ethic ethically and ethically too yeah

1854
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:06,620
yeah fifth dream in chat says I wonder how many other crappy ports of stuff was caused by the

1855
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:14,460
copy protection well in this case it seems to be most of the blame is the Capcom DRM but didn't

1856
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:21,620
have also sucks man how I sometimes miss the days I've turned to page 5 in the manual and type the

1857
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:28,820
third word on the fourth line that would be defeated I guess that doesn't anymore these days

1858
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:34,820
nope or the or the god what was it some of the Sierra games had the copy proof paper it was like

1859
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:38,420
the dark red paper maybe was a Sierra I don't know but there's some company that had like the

1860
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:47,940
I know dark red you couldn't copy it this is funny all right let's move on orange right in

1861
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:55,900
chat says dial-a-pirate I love dial-a-pirate all right moving on let's talk about oh I think this

1862
02:16:55,900 --> 02:17:00,220
is actually last story we have tonight for our listener roundtable it's a story about robot

1863
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:07,140
wrote not roadblocks but roblox they've just formed a deal with Sony to help with some of

1864
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:11,780
the music issues now remember this was a thing that was starting to sneak up on on roblox was

1865
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:17,540
how they were getting dragged off over all these copyright problems I'm sure it's snuck up on them

1866
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:23,220
they weren't totally aware of all of the rampant piracy and copyright theft on their service maybe

1867
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:29,780
okay the courts are sneaking up on them and the legal stuff is starting to okay so anyway now

1868
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:35,220
they are on their way to get some music deals because of the 200 million dollar lawsuit over

1869
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:41,540
copyright violations so roblox has unveiled a team-up with Sony music so this will allow the

1870
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:47,300
label artists to be on the game platform the two will collaborate in innovative music experiences

1871
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:53,060
apparently there's going to be a Lil Nas X concert in November can I just pause the show to

1872
02:17:53,060 --> 02:18:01,780
have a appreciation moment for Lil Nas X I realize I realize um what he's doing is is uh very um you

1873
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:06,100
know it's it's causing some people to go that's a little much for television that's a little much

1874
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:15,700
but you know what it is fucking fascinating to me fucking fascinating to me that when Lil Nas X

1875
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:20,180
kisses a dude during a performance on the BET awards or whatever that was that happened was

1876
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:23,780
certainly alive where that happened too I don't know but in his live performances where that is

1877
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:30,980
happening they will show that clip and stop it right before that moment happens and then

1878
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:36,980
immediately run the clip from the video music awards from like 15 years ago when Madonna kissed

1879
02:18:36,980 --> 02:18:44,260
Britney and Christina Aguilera but they don't censor that one what's the difference what's

1880
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:48,740
the difference one makes the straight white males uncomfortable

1881
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:57,460
does does Lil Nas X make you uncomfortable no I don't care I'm insane and and why not

1882
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:03,460
I think he's super cute I and why does Lil Nas X not make you uncomfortable this is and this I'm

1883
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:08,340
not interrogating you I I think you actually are a model you're a model heterosexual I want other

1884
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:15,540
heterosexuals to hear this what why are you not bothered by Lil Nas X who cares who he's kissing

1885
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:23,460
he's not kissing me I don't care that's a TV oh my god a lot what a logical conclusion Loki that

1886
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:29,620
is very you're right you're right it doesn't affect you you're right it's amazing outstanding

1887
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:34,980
it's like I seriously think like some of the like mindset people have about this like stupid people

1888
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:41,060
let's be clear it's absolute stupid people it's just like oh my god if I watch this I'm gonna be

1889
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:47,460
gay you know like it's it's stupid people I'm sorry and there's a lot of stupid people in this

1890
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:53,380
country unfortunately and around the world yeah you want to know what makes you gay mass effect

1891
02:19:54,980 --> 02:20:02,980
kidding so look I just but I will say all that I I think Lil Nas X like the way he's responding

1892
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:08,180
to his critics is on point and I wish there was somebody like him that I had when I was younger

1893
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:15,220
because when I was younger all we had was Madonna and that's why Madonna is such a gay icon for

1894
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:23,860
people around my age is because she was the person that was basically like I'm gonna you know do this

1895
02:20:23,860 --> 02:20:29,060
stuff and be unapologetic I'm gonna be unapologetically me whether you like it or not

1896
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:35,780
mm-hmm so anyway sorry little bit I didn't mean for a Roblox story to get me on this tangent

1897
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:42,420
but here we are it is a well are all right that's what we do that's true I'm gonna go on a tangent

1898
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:48,180
so my kids or my my son's actually taking the class a coding class for Roblox this week which

1899
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:54,260
is kind of fun these are excited about that but they've been knee deep in uh Brookhaven which is

1900
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:58,420
a game on Roblox and tell me about all the lore and stuff that happens it's like some

1901
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:05,700
roleplay game thing where you get to pretend to be like rich people or kids or I don't know

1902
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:11,940
something hmm now I know who Lil Nas X is and that's who's doing the concert in Roblox in

1903
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:18,180
November I do not know who Zara Larsson is can a young person explain this to me who is who's

1904
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:25,620
Zari Larsson that is a they are getting a launch party in May whoever that is sorry um I'm getting

1905
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:30,500
to that age y'all I need do we have some 20-somethings out there in the audience can

1906
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:36,660
somebody explain to me who is that who should now I feel like I'm the Dionne Warwick talk show and

1907
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:42,180
I'm inviting the guest on who are you and why should I care about you like what have you seen

1908
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:47,460
that sketch of Saturday Night Live because that's like my favorite thing anyway uh oh see see the

1909
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:55,300
chat is already lighting up I don't know who this is I'm sorry she's a Swedish pop icon oh no wonder

1910
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:58,100
no wonder my comment just rubbed you the wrong way

1911
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:09,700
let's see bonds 006 says Rob we need a younger audience to connect with uh I guess I just can't

1912
02:22:09,700 --> 02:22:15,540
listen to all of the music in the world like sorry especially pop music I'm not listening to any of

1913
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:21,540
that but if it's Swedish I'll honestly if it's Swedish pop I will probably there's a larger

1914
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:26,820
chance I'll probably like it like to be to be fair and you know what there was there was a date so

1915
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:31,380
there Carlos there was a date and time when I didn't know who Carly Rae Jepsen was

1916
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:36,260
but then I had it explained to me and I listened to some of the songs I was like oh

1917
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:41,780
yes queen go off sis I guess all of that

1918
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:50,260
so maybe I'll do this she won she won one of the Got Talent shows oh did she uh okay okay

1919
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:55,220
all right um moving on let's see what else I want to see about the Roblox store this really wasn't

1920
02:22:55,220 --> 02:23:03,060
supposed to be old man yells at cloud but here we are he said it not me and I'm older uh they

1921
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:09,380
you do but you're you're young you're young at heart and hip anyway um yes this is not yeah

1922
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:17,540
along with my broken hip I'm uh this is not the first deal Roblox is made there was a deal with

1923
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:23,300
bmg and warner as well uh so universal is the only big label that hasn't signed an agreement

1924
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:30,100
yet so this could bode well for Roblox um why doesn't like youtube do something like this or

1925
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:40,900
why doesn't twitch yeah I think that would be great there you go um Carlos says Rob you'll

1926
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:45,860
like it I need to get you on the Nordic pop queens um I already listened to Robin what else do I need

1927
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:47,220
really

1928
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:54,500
I love Robin all right excuse me I'll keep dancing on my own and like it

1929
02:23:56,340 --> 02:24:01,300
actually and legit um before the pandemic actually it was probably about a year before the pandemic

1930
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:07,380
I saw Robin live in Oakland on the tour for her latest album that is not Swedish that is legit

1931
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:14,820
one of the who said she's Irish and it's not Swedish no bonds 006 is

1932
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,820
listening like pop music I'm like uh no that's she's she's Irish

1933
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:28,820
Carlos uh says I mean Robin was your era since she started glowing up in the 90s

1934
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:34,420
was that shade was that do we need the shade button was that shade I don't think it was

1935
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:39,620
intended shade it was more like a passing cloud I don't read it as such it's fine

1936
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:45,940
it was a little bit of fog rolling in that's fine no one special 77 says

1937
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:52,580
Roxette and ace of base yo now we're fucking talking now we're fucking talking Roxette

1938
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:59,780
that was my era that oh and mine too there's plenty to go around share you know it was funny

1939
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:09,060
those like Roxette and ace of base were my guilty pleasures because I was still like radio head

1940
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:16,820
Pearl Jam you know Soundgarden all of the stuff that came out of the grunge revolution and then

1941
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:22,820
I was also listening to Ace of Base I'm living proof you can have one foot in goth industrial

1942
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:28,180
and you can have the other foot in DDR music okay I'm living proof there's nothing wrong with it

1943
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:40,020
well and also like like mid-90s j-pop um Carlos and chat says if I recall correctly members of

1944
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:46,420
Ace of Base are problematic now yeah some things happen one of them had a problematic past yeah

1945
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:52,580
I'm trying to just uh remember what I remember in the 90s so that's uh that's how I look at that

1946
02:25:53,460 --> 02:26:00,180
um and then um well it's like I own some jeffree star makeup that I bought before I knew what a

1947
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:04,660
piece of shit he was I'm not selling it because it was expensive I'm not throwing it away because

1948
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:09,140
I paid money for it but I'm not gonna buy anymore I'm just gonna transition this to listener

1949
02:26:09,140 --> 02:26:13,780
roundtable because that's essentially what we're doing right now uh we have other comments in

1950
02:26:13,780 --> 02:26:21,540
chat bonds 006 says Soundgarden Radiohead P.O.D. Chevelle Rob Zombie Tattoo I stopped now that is

1951
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:30,180
okay like like at least half of those I at least own one album by them for sure um let's see um

1952
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:39,940
uh moving on uh shad star six in chat saying the new world ends with you has this goth synth pop

1953
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:44,900
song and it's one of my favorites from the demo that okay but speaking of like goth and

1954
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:50,660
synth pop coming together that's why I love echo image so much that's what that band is

1955
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:56,420
echo a different drum was kind of a goth label like I guess I know a lot of synth pop it was

1956
02:26:56,420 --> 02:27:01,860
it would that blend was like that so I that's why they're one of my favorites

1957
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:11,940
I mean and there is goth synthwave I mean the whole uh uh retro new wave movement which is

1958
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:18,980
kind of like sort of my thing right now there's a lot of crossover into like the goth uh uh

1959
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:27,780
I'd say uh what's the word I'm thinking of like the umbrella of goth yeah it branches out to so

1960
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:32,260
many different things I mean because you have your old industrial I mean

1961
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:41,380
it it's always been married absolutely that's what the cure is to me the cure is

1962
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:47,460
I'm thinking really like they're not you're probably the synth pop I know you're talking

1963
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:52,820
more like a epoxy berserk and things like that and um the other one okay so before we did olr

1964
02:27:53,540 --> 02:27:57,140
um I used to go to goth club all the time no I've told this story before that was my Sunday night

1965
02:27:57,140 --> 02:28:02,180
was goth nights at the rage which is doesn't even there anymore I went to the other one this is

1966
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:07,860
funny but yeah in midtown but I remember the asylum was what they called it asylum always

1967
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:12,340
closed out every night the lat one of the last songs they would play was wilsham once in a

1968
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:21,540
lifetime that you remember that that's where my bachelorette party ended up oh yeah yeah yeah

1969
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:29,140
at asylum uh-huh that was my bachelorette party yeah but there was um they got the

1970
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:35,380
dj to play echo image right when yeah I remember that I think that was Jessica that did that too

1971
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:40,420
got the dj to play echo image like and and um the guy actually liked it and put it in his rotation

1972
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:43,780
for a couple months which I thought was yeah it just that was right around the time a ddr

1973
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:50,500
ultra mix 2 came out so yeah it's awesome oh love that um let's see uh fifth dream says I

1974
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:56,740
miss goth night but the pandemic puts so many goth nights on twitch um bonds 006 says no love

1975
02:28:56,740 --> 02:29:02,980
for grunge music no I just I didn't maybe follow it as much yeah no just say that I did yeah um

1976
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:09,780
I don't I probably didn't listen to as much of it but you kind of you you listen to it I don't

1977
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:14,340
know when I was growing up in the 90s I was doing a little bit of everything honestly you know you

1978
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:23,380
go to my collection and you would see things like like pm dawn and radio head elanis uh just any

02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:28,980
anything and everything anyhow um let's see

1980

02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:46,500
shane is gonna get it but he had to kind of talk himself into it a little bit he wasn't like

1983
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:50,020
oh my god I gotta get one right away after seeing the trailer

nick cave song is the ship song which is like a slow bow I love that song anyway all right

1991
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:46,660
you know you know who I always had like this mental impression of the most interesting duet

1992
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:53,300
ever would have been leonard cohen and nick cave could you just imagine surprised that

1993
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:59,220
ever happened yeah um okay now lady fingers does like my personal theme song just to tell

1994
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:04,820
shad stars like that um and shane's in chat and wants to say I will be getting it the oled switch

1995
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:09,060
yes I went back and forth because it's only a screen upgrade but then I realized I barely play

1996
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:12,900
it docked so there was so okay so I didn't mischaracterize that there was a little back

1997
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:17,380
and forth he didn't just say oh I'm getting it because it's new and shiny uh he had to

1998
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:23,060
talk himself into it a little bit all right anyway uh moving on uh I was gonna get to our email I

1999
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:27,540
don't think we have any tonight we don't have any let me shout let me shout it out anyway participate

2000
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:32,260
at orange lounge radio.com but sadly there are no emails to read tonight but maybe we'll get some in

2001
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:38,500
the future that means I get to have a quick drag race tangent because I'm watching all star six

2002
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:45,060
I'm actually watching it I need to buy it is it any good um buy it oh oh yeah because you that's

2003
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:50,420
right you download by episode I have paramount plus but um actually yes because give me your

2004
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:57,060
login okay I will just remind me and I will um the thing I like about it is that it's not

2005
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:02,100
like what I was really starting to get turned off with with drag race was it was just drama drama

2006
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:07,140
drama drama manufactured drama and all star six is surprising considering this is a cast that has

2007
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:12,020
eureka silky nutmeg ganache and some of the queens that are kind of known for that stuff

2008
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:18,980
like honestly redemption is a very strong theme this season and people like silky nutmeg ganache

2009
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:22,820
know exactly how they were received by the public and they are doing everything they can to change

2010
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:29,540
it does she still draw her brows on with a sharpie um I just I just prefer to talk about the milk and

2011
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:36,180
cookies in her titties but anyway that is okay that is uh that that's that's my quick tangent

2012
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:40,180
on drag race is that I'm actually enjoying all star six and what's really surprised me is some

2013
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:44,980
of the queens that are doing well were not the ones I was expecting to so it's very very

2014
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:50,740
interesting yeah this is a very redemption based season so message me and I'll I'll do a little

2015
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:55,940
marathon um yeah you you just you I'll call you later but you have to you have to because you're

2016
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:59,140
going to probably stream after the show tonight so I'll probably do it tomorrow yeah but you have

2017
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:03,220
to go and log in and then you get an activation code and then I put in the code that's how got

2018
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:08,660
you yeah all right cool all right I'll uh I'll tell Dan we'll get that set up okay cool yeah I

2019
02:33:08,660 --> 02:33:12,820
don't care just watch whatever you want I just uh don't do it on Thursdays when they release them

2020
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:17,780
because that's when I watch them but okay I think we're the only other person I'm sharing with is

2021
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:23,140
only on it for Star Trek so I don't think that's a problem right now so I want to watch that too so

2022
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:30,740
binge away have fun all right all right anyway uh let's move on um oh I there was a big old

2023
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:34,820
question here from no one special I want to make sure I get that here no one special always tries

2024
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:39,540
to come up with a good question for the listener round table and I think I skimmed it ah yes okay

2025
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:44,260
so this is about video game movies uh no one special says as you all know video game movies

2026
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:48,100
are nothing new and have been around for ages they run the gamut from terrible see the blood

2027
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:52,980
rain movies well just honestly anything with ue bowl right uh to fairly good the silent hill

2028
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:57,540
movies and have been in multiple genres documentaries fictional stories etc all that

2029
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:02,820
being said is there any video game movie that stands out for you that you particularly enjoy

2030
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:07,700
even if it may be an unpopular choice for me I especially love the first two final

2031
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:15,300
fantasy movies and the king of arcades so video game movies you uh enjoyed even if the masses

2032
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:20,020
didn't see I would I love silent hill that's what I'd say is silent hill the masses didn't

2033
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:25,220
really like that movie I liked the first resident evil that really had nothing to do with it

2034
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:31,780
yeah to me yeah um I am so jazzed see now now it's interesting because it's not just movies

2035
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:38,500
now it's going to be tv shows because again we have the witcher which okay yeah book you know

2036
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:44,900
whatever it's kind of on the line um but I could I even I wonder if I could answer this question

2037
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:50,420
with something like because you said um Mortal Kombat the very first one well I was gonna say

2038
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:56,180
what about something like stranger things I know that isn't rooted in gaming but I'll be damned if

2039
02:34:56,180 --> 02:35:00,900
that show doesn't feel like a video game plot and kind of tickle a lot of the same like retro stuff

2040
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:08,580
that video games kind of do for me I don't know oh I also like to warcraft oh SSJ100 Matt says

2041
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:12,660
Scott Pilgrim while not a gaming movie per se didn't get the props it should have at the box

2042
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:18,980
office I'm gonna I had a lot of fun we did a um a cult hosting of that um right before the pandemic

2043
02:35:18,980 --> 02:35:23,860
no I mean it was about a year before um but we I remember hosting it in a double feature with

2044
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:30,900
Kung Fury here locally and that was a lot of fun that showing was a ton of fun and to get to watch

2045
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:36,020
Scott Pilgrim with other nerds and stuff that enjoy the movie that was a lot of fun Shane

2046
02:35:36,020 --> 02:35:40,500
actually went to that I guess that was a while ago because Shane was actually here so uh it must

2047
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:46,020
have been several years ago I'm just losing track of time um but yeah that was uh that was a lot of

2048
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:51,700
fun to host that one um there's also all of the Pokemon movies but those are a little bit more

2049
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:58,820
related to the anime Carlos said Detective Pikachu though which I I think that's a good choice that

2050
02:35:58,820 --> 02:36:03,780
was a good movie I like that so yeah I feel like the gaming but now now we're going to be talking

2051
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:08,900
about gaming tv shows too I can't wait for that Final Fantasy 14 show I'm gonna I'm gonna eat that

2052
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:13,140
up whenever that comes out I mean I know that's been slowed down because the pandemic um you know

2053
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:17,380
I did also kind of like House of the Dead but only kind of liked it it was more like I need

2054
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:23,140
something completely mindless and violent to watch it's okay to like things in a cheesy kind of way

2055
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:31,060
too yeah well I mean I love Xanadu so whatever um oh Bobby Blackwood legacy is not a video game

2056
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:36,660
movie but but I get it I get it and I I think that is an answer that would qualify because

2057
02:36:37,380 --> 02:36:42,260
no it's not directly a video game movie but it did kind of spawn the video games like especially

2058
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:47,380
the early the Tron from the 80s especially you know spawned the the actual arcade machine discs

2059
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:52,500
of Tron and I think it was more about like arcade culture was definitely like a part of that so I

2060
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:58,500
I would I would count Tron legacy um but Bobby Blackwolf I like this move answer too not a video

2061
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:02,500
game movie but looks like a video game if someone asks me what's your favorite movie that most

2062
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:08,180
people hate or never give a chance it's Speed Racer I feel like that's that game that movie

2063
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:13,940
was great it's actually well it's also a game too but um yeah the movie was amazing that's

2064
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:20,420
one of those movies I feel like time is being very kind too and like a lot of people like I

2065
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:25,700
hear more about that movie now and people looking back on that fondly than I did when the movie came

2066
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:31,700
out you know how like there's a lot of movies that end up aging pretty well and then people kind of

2067
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:36,420
look back on it more fondly than when it was originally out it's definitely one of those so

2068
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:43,860
love that all right um I think that's it for uh the the movie chat and the the round table stuff

2069
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:47,780
let's check in to see if there's any last minute stories and then we'll close up shop tonight I'm

2070
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:51,300
sorry I didn't go to discord tonight but we are running we're almost to nine o'clock so I want

2071
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:55,380
to make sure we kind of wrap up here in the coming moments so let me go to the last minute stories

2072
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:59,220
oh I will shout out the discord though because I do read it and I know I pulled some stories

2073
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:04,500
for tonight from it so vog network.com discord I enjoy seeing the chatter and the story suggestions

2074
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:11,060
throughout the week um Loki do you have any last minute stories not really I mean there's um a

2075
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:18,340
rumor of a game was it a fighting game based off of Nicktoons that I think they've already had an

2076
02:38:18,340 --> 02:38:24,500
ios and android version of that's being ported to the switch in October so that's it all right

2077
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:30,340
well then we will go around and get everybody's final thoughts um yeah tiger claws saying the

2078
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:36,900
movie was directed by the directors of the the matrix um so uh yeah the Wachowskis uh and that is

2079
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:45,380
uh are are they both doing the new matrix movie or just they are I think so I think it might be just

2080
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:51,460
Lana that's doing the matrix I don't know but they're um but yeah um I'm I'm I'm gonna sound

2081
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:56,180
like Loki here but I really want to see that new matrix movie me too it looks like it's gonna be

2082
02:38:56,180 --> 02:39:03,380
awesome they have now amazing yeah and plus I loved Sensei I need to actually I only got like

2083
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:07,860
halfway through the second season I just was bad timing for me I need to go back and finish that

2084
02:39:07,860 --> 02:39:13,460
because that was uh that was an awesome show and that was the Wachowskis as well so awesome all

2085
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:19,140
right and Bobby Blackwolf confirms it's just Lana so I I don't know but it's other projects or

2086
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:25,940
something going on all right um anyhow let's wrap it up with final thoughts and then we will uh

2087
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:31,140
be out of here for tonight but I believe dark soccer is doing some uh some some dead by daylight

2090
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:48,020

2104
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:57,780
a site like itunes or wherever it is you found this podcast um spotify google play or whatever

2105
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:03,700
um thank you thank you and uh you share uh auto hosts on uh twitch they go a long way as well so

2106
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:08,500
thank you to everybody who helps us out with all of that um now I think I'll go to final thoughts

2107
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:12,740
now that I said that that mandatory part that we always have to say um because it's fully good

2108
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:19,460
information so dark soccer what is your final thought tonight um uh I'm gonna I might play

2109
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:27,860
pyramid head for the first time so I need help um my advice is don't overdo the trail but remember

2110
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:34,420
that trail will help you out like crazy in chases so chase where palette or uh use the trail where

2111
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:41,060
pallets used to be use the uh trail by windows I do it little blips by the um places that because

2112
02:41:41,060 --> 02:41:44,980
then they act more if you leave a big old line survivors will see it and they'll duck under it

2113
02:41:44,980 --> 02:41:48,980
but if you leave little blips it'll function more like trapper traps and you're more likely to hit

2114
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:55,140
people with it um and then the other but I found that that was that other move that's the projectile

2115
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:59,460
kind of attack I found that goes through walls the laser yes laser beam I don't know the real name

2116
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:05,940
laser beam is great but don't rely on it I in my opinion the laser here's where the laser beam is

2117
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:11,220
going to be the best um if you know and you you've played enough killer now dark soccer you know

2118
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:16,180
when a survivor is about to palette you right pretty much you will be shocked at how many

2119
02:42:16,180 --> 02:42:21,300
survivors forget the pyramid head has a laser beam so when you know you're about to get palleted

2120
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:25,700
hold the right mouse button to start drawing your lines and as soon as they throw the palette down

2121
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:30,580
do your laser and you'll hit them every single time that sounds delightful I might enjoy him

2122
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:35,780
I enjoyed Freddie more than I thought I would Freddie's a lot of fun so yeah anyway all right

2123
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:41,380
um so okay well have a did I get your final thought I don't oh that was my final thought

2124
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:45,540
I'm gonna I might play pyramid head and I need help I could I didn't know if it was just another

2125
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:49,700
tangent or a final thought I couldn't remember sorry all right have a great story and but I am

2126
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:54,420
going to gracefully see myself out for now I will not be on cam tonight just because these bright

2127
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:58,980
lights are giving me a fucking headache all right sorry for the migraine all right feel better

not vaccinated please consider getting the vaccine please read up on the facts about the vaccine and

2141
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:13,460
not a lot of the myths that are out there on the internet because the more people that get

2142
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:17,220
vaccinated the less chance these other things are going to spread around and the more chance we can

2143
