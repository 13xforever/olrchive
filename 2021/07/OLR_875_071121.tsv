0	12960	We're back and we're bringing you news from around the game universe while we bake
12960	14840	in the 2021 heat dome.
14840	18280	Cooking in the oven we have some evergreen stories of cheating, piracy, piracy being
18280	22000	better than the official release and the unsurprising news that a Pokemon game nets billions of
22000	23640	dollars during its existence.
23640	26640	Also there's more Assassin's Creed coming, you get such a clock to news about that in
26640	27640	Call of Duty.
27640	30280	This is the non-exhaustive list of stories we're set to cover tonight and now it's time
30280	33560	for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Logie to provide you with the details
33560	36160	of these and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36160	37160	every gamer has a voice.
37160	38160	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
38160	47520	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47520	53200	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back after a little break for the holiday last
53200	60120	week once again, live with episode number 875 of our show for tonight, July the 11th
60120	61120	of 2021.
61120	63960	It has been a heck of a week.
63960	66760	We'll talk all about that in just a moment, but first let me say hello.
66760	71000	I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
71000	72000	Hello.
72000	74520	Hi, how are you?
74520	78160	I have decided to be natural today.
78160	79160	Yes.
79160	80160	So that...
80160	86040	I was just saying, you're going the natural makeup free, but you have an upgraded camera
86040	89600	thing going on for those watching on Twitch, because I have to say this every week, we
89600	95920	do tape live every Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network,
95920	99720	the voice of geeks network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
99720	104800	Shout out to Bobby Black Wolf for an excellent job hosting that SGDQ, Summer Games Done Quick
104800	106040	finale last night.
106040	107940	We'll talk more about that in a little bit.
107940	110700	Shout out to the raid we just got as well before we went live tonight.
110700	111700	Thank you for that.
111700	116940	He who is Steve, allegedly, supposedly Steve, if that is Steve's real name.
116940	117940	No, thank you very much for the raid.
117940	121940	Anyway, I was just saying your camera is all nice and fancy.
121940	126580	Well, I was using like this knockoff GoPro looking thing.
126580	127980	You ordered it off Wish.
127980	128980	Just say it.
128980	130280	You ordered it off Wish.
130280	132460	I didn't order it off Wish, I ordered it on AliExpress.
132460	134540	I thought it might be Wish.
134540	137060	Which is only a step up.
137060	145700	But I was doing some research and I was looking at getting a Logitech Brio, lots of money,
145700	146700	right?
146700	148740	And then I thought about it.
148740	150140	It works so good.
150140	153860	Loki, you be quiet till I introduce you.
153860	158060	That's my turn.
158060	165140	So what I ended up doing is I was looking at reviews of cameras and people were actually
165140	169180	showing about using your iPhone as a camera.
169180	172460	And I was like, why I have an iPhone?
172460	175620	Why I have a Mac?
175620	181300	And I can tell you that, first of all, I have two different apps that I'm using and one
181300	186500	of them I use for OBS that has an even higher resolution and even less latency.
186500	190380	The one I have to use for this, and this is just like the free version.
190380	195580	So it's only 720p, but it looks great.
195580	206420	The iPhone camera is miles above any on the market capture device short of using a professional
206420	208820	4K camera with a conversion.
208820	211900	And this is basically the equivalent of doing it.
211900	216540	So I have this rig set up that has my phone on it.
216540	221500	And right now I'm running through camo, which again, all the reviews of using an iPhone
221500	227340	versus a Logitech Brio, this blows the Brio out of the water.
227340	229600	So I've got my apps all set up.
229600	233380	You don't need an IP for the record.
233380	240740	There's an OBS, iPhone for OBS app that does it natively for OBS.
240740	244140	So you don't need to have an IP or an address or anything like that.
244140	250940	You just straight up hook up, install the link plugin and you're set.
250940	252220	The same with camo.
252220	253700	It works the same way.
253700	261140	I am incredibly happy with it and well, I can charge my phone and do stuff at the same
261140	262140	time.
262140	267100	So yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.
267100	271300	Depending on how this goes, I may actually pay for this one.
271300	275980	You know, I'm going to have to re-listen to this and take notes seriously or try to
275980	279460	get some links from you for some of this, because this is really good for the whole
279460	285260	discussion about, you know, anybody can have a Twitch channel or anybody can have a YouTube.
285260	287060	Anybody can do a podcast.
287060	288660	You know, we want to get more voices out there.
288660	292400	We want to get, you know, a lot of diversity and a lot of different people out there.
292400	295580	And a lot of folks think they have to buy this big, fancy technical equipment to get
295580	296640	started.
296640	298900	And it turns out, you can probably just use your phone.
298900	303460	I mean, you might have to pay a small fee for, you know, the converter thing or whatever,
303460	304660	but that's pretty awesome.
304660	309140	Well, and the thing is just to point out something that Tiger Claw is saying is to use like an
309140	310140	IP one.
310140	311140	No, don't use an IP.
311140	313140	Anything that uses an IP.
313140	316300	Use something that's going to use plugins and your USB cable.
316300	318020	You will get far less latency that way.
318020	319540	Oh, good to know.
319540	320540	All right.
320540	321540	Yeah.
321540	322540	And usually a higher image quality.
322540	326040	Before I go to Loki, how did you, did you have a good week off?
326040	330040	I think you were here streaming that night, right?
330040	331040	I don't remember.
331040	335000	The 4th of July we had off here at O.L.R. because the holiday in the States at my normal
335000	336000	time.
336000	337000	Gotcha.
337000	338000	OK.
338000	339000	We went swimming.
339000	340000	OK.
340000	341000	Yeah.
341000	342000	Nice.
342000	343000	Nice.
343000	344000	I spent I spent the day up in the.
344000	348320	So for those of you that remember an old, old show, I used to host here on Vaga called
348320	349320	Horde House.
349320	351440	It was about like Warcraft and other online games.
351440	356000	So or if you ever heard Starboard Power Coupling, that was Captain Matt or Grandpa Matt, depending
356000	357880	what show it was, his show.
357880	360040	And he has a cabin out in the woods literally now.
360040	361440	So he has a cabin out in the woods.
361440	362880	And so he invited us up for the fourth.
362880	364440	And it was great because you know what?
364440	369320	No fireworks because they are all banned up there because that is primo.
369320	371360	You know, unfortunately, forest fire territory.
371360	372360	So fireworks are huge.
372360	373360	No, no.
373360	374360	It was so quiet and so peaceful.
374360	376520	I had a great fourth.
376520	377520	Lovely.
377520	381560	Anyway, high tech master Loki, how are you?
381560	385020	You could get around that band by just saying that you're doing a gender reveal and then
385060	387060	it's OK.
387060	390220	No, that's even worse.
390220	394740	Those stupid parties have even more disaster than anything else.
394740	397580	It's just, oh, my gosh, ridiculous anyway.
397580	398580	How was your holiday?
398580	399580	How was your break?
399580	400580	It was fine.
400580	406820	We just went over to my mom's house because my niece is born on the Fourth of July.
406820	409140	So it was her birthday as well.
409140	414540	So we went over there, just did pizza and lit up some fireworks.
415060	416060	Nice.
416060	419020	Sounds like you had a nice, nice little break.
419020	420020	How's that?
420020	421060	How's the YouTube channel going?
421060	423460	You posted another video in the past few days, right?
423460	424460	I'm not.
424460	428220	Well, I posted one last week, I think.
428220	433500	It's been a struggle because we've been having weird server issue things.
433500	437100	Also, the build I'm doing right now is very big.
437100	442660	And so it's taken a long time to get to the point where I can do a time lapse and actually
442660	443660	build it.
443780	446780	I'm finished with the design stuff right now because I'm finishing what I started with
446780	450780	Tango, kind of the build inspired by that.
450780	452640	It's enormous.
452640	456840	So I've been just kind of working to get there and we just updated the 117.1.
456840	460680	So with that came other things that are breaking.
460680	466460	So I got stuff to work, though, finally, but it's just been a little bit of a struggle.
466460	467460	All right.
467460	470060	Yeah, I did release a video, I think, last week.
470060	471760	I wanted to release one this week.
471760	475920	I will try to get it out as early as I can.
475920	483040	We've had people leave the server as well, and they've gone to other SMP servers, which
483040	485200	looked pretty fun.
485200	487520	But I'm sticking with this one until the end of the season.
487520	489440	So we'll see what happens.
489440	490440	All right.
490440	491440	Sounds good.
491440	493360	So we're going to get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
493360	497040	But first, I thought I'd kind of reintroduce the show since we were off last week.
497040	499640	It's been a little while since I've done a little reintroduction.
499640	503640	And we got that nice little raid here at the top of the show tonight between Bobby's
503640	505480	show going off air and us coming on air.
505480	506480	So hi.
506480	507480	Hi.
507480	508480	That's our intro.
508480	509480	Hi.
509480	513920	We're Orange Lawns Radio, and we have just entered our 20th year of internet broadcasting,
513920	514920	if you can believe it.
514920	519000	We celebrated our 19th birthday, that was our last live episode two weeks ago.
519000	520720	So we've been doing this show for a long time.
520720	526640	We all met as frenzies playing Dance Dance Revolution and other music games at the arcade.
526640	528720	That's how we met.
528720	529720	Which is great.
529720	533520	So to kind of talk a little bit about Summer Games Done Quick a little bit, which our pal
533520	538480	Bobby was involved with, they had a really cute run of some music games that they did.
538480	542080	And they were doing Dance Rush Stardom, which is what they do online.
542080	545160	That's the new one they do, which has no...
545160	548800	It's funny because that's what we used to talk about back in the day was, imagine if
548800	551420	it was just one giant pad and it could reach...
551420	554800	That's literally what Dance Rush Stardom is, but it was really cute because they got the
554800	556320	whole community involved at the end.
556320	559240	And I was like, oh, that is something we would have done back in the day.
559240	560240	It's adorable.
560240	561840	So anyway, that's the whole...
561840	564800	Those music games have been around forever and that's where we were all kind of born
564800	565820	out of.
565820	570720	We did a show on Live 365 for a long time and then time passes and for us, there was
570720	576800	a long break in music games between the last DDR they really did and then the rock band.
576800	580320	So kind of in that interim, we decided we're going to talk about all video games and make
580320	582220	our show about all types of games.
582220	583880	And that's where we've been at ever since.
583880	584920	It's been a very long time.
584920	590280	So we were live on Shoutcast for a long time and we made the switch to Twitch about two
590280	592360	years ago and it's been working great.
592360	596880	We get to meet a lot more people, you get to see our faces for better or for worse.
596880	598880	But remember, we are recording a podcast.
598880	603920	So sometimes our video interactions are a little bit minimal because we have had this
603920	610400	podcast pretty much before iTunes launched podcasting, so a very, very long time.
610400	614720	So we mainly do this for the folks listening on the podcast feed.
614720	618000	But of course, we love the folks that join us live on Sunday nights as well.
618000	620000	You know what, Rob?
620000	621000	Yes.
621000	625360	I'll just say real quick, Orange Wright shared that clip from episode one where we predicted
625360	626360	Dance Rush.
626360	627360	Sorry.
627360	628360	Yes.
628360	629360	Yes, Jamie.
629360	634640	So I was thinking that when I submitted us for a Guinness World Record, I said longest
634640	636840	running internet video game show.
636840	637840	Yeah.
637840	643240	I should have actually said longest running video game show.
643240	648280	Because yeah, I don't know what on TV or traditional radio would be longer.
648280	652000	Well, I mean, really just any sort of video game program.
652000	653000	Yeah.
653000	654000	I can't think of...
654000	655400	You know, non-print.
655400	661240	We've outlasted and gone longer than just about anything that's been on TV.
661240	664000	Oh, Bobby says Electric Playground still exists.
664000	667060	They started in the 90s in Canada and they're still on today.
667100	672820	No big break because I wouldn't count X-Play because there's going to be a big break there
672820	675060	between all that.
675060	676060	But if that's...
676060	677060	Then it is what it is.
677060	678060	When are they coming back?
678060	681580	They keep talking about G-Force coming back, G-Force coming back.
681580	682580	When?
682580	684060	When is that happening?
684060	689140	Because I hear all the hype about it's coming back, but I don't see it coming back.
689140	691780	To be clear, I know they are different shows, I'm aware.
691780	694540	But I'm just saying, I was using X-Play as an example.
694540	697460	They are at a big break and so that wouldn't count.
697460	698460	So anyway.
698460	701740	Yeah, because they did like a thing back in Thanksgiving.
701740	705780	That was like eight months ago.
705780	709300	Where is G-Force?
709300	710300	It's still...
710300	713020	Well, back to the Guinness World Record.
713020	716340	Yes, please.
716340	722120	I'm glad that I submitted it in the category that I did because it is a first.
722120	724320	And I'm feeling very confident that we're going to get it.
724320	725320	That's exciting.
725320	726320	Very, very confident.
726320	727320	That's exciting.
727320	730200	So I don't think we're going to get it because everything goes...
730200	732760	Everything is unfortunately bad for me.
732760	734920	So I'm going to expect we don't get it.
734920	737400	I'm just bringing the whole show down.
737400	738720	Who says I'm doing it for you?
738720	740200	I'm doing it for me.
740200	741200	It's just by association.
741200	742800	Have you ever seen the movie The Cooler?
742800	747760	Yeah, I'm the cooler, but just in the sense of like reality and yeah.
747760	748760	And I'm an apothesis.
748760	750940	So my thought is, eh.
750940	751940	Don't you dare.
751940	752940	I don't need this.
752940	753940	No, it'll be awesome.
753940	754940	It'll be awesome.
754940	755940	All right.
755940	756940	Yeah.
756940	760540	Let's get into it before we get accused of not ever talking about video games.
760540	766260	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and talk about a big story that's going around
766260	767940	the gaming world this week.
767940	771180	And that is Nintendo unveiled a new Switch.
771180	772180	Switch Pro!
772180	773180	Wait.
773180	774180	Yawn.
774180	775180	Yawn.
775180	776180	Gotcha.
776180	777180	Okay, so...
777180	778180	Major yawn.
778180	787020	The thing is that I don't want to say I told you so, but we set our expectations, not we,
787020	788020	but you.
788020	789460	I'm saying we to be nice.
789460	791820	Set your expectations a little high.
791820	793500	By we, we mean you.
793500	795100	Yeah, by we, we mean you.
795100	798180	I had no expectations, so they've met none of that.
798180	799300	This is a relationship.
799300	800660	When I say it's not you, it's me.
800660	803580	It's actually you.
803580	808540	The problem is y'all set your expectations too high on social media for that Switch Pro
808540	813860	because Bloomberg and all these other clickbait sites that exist to generate revenue based
813860	814860	off clicks.
814860	815860	I don't want to say they lied.
815860	817900	I actually don't think they lied.
817900	824900	But they hyped up some rumors and whispers and things written on bathroom stalls that
824900	830300	perhaps were not ready for prime time just yet.
830300	831740	So we found out we are getting a new Switch.
831740	833140	So let's talk about what we are getting.
833140	834700	It's an OLED model.
834700	838900	So in a nutshell, it's going to be a different handheld unit.
838900	841900	It will be a seven inch handheld with the OLED screen.
841900	843660	That's going to be the biggest change.
843660	846260	So basically it's going to look more like a PlayStation Vita because I think the Vita
846260	847860	used OLED, if I'm not mistaken.
847860	848860	Right.
848860	849860	That's a gorgeous screen.
849860	852300	Like that's that's the reason to still play again.
852300	853720	Final Fantasy four.
853720	857380	My favorite to play it on is the Vita, the PSP version on the Vita.
857380	859060	That is my favorite way to play that game.
859060	861300	And these new little remakes they're doing.
861300	862660	I know we're not going to be as good.
862660	867340	So anyway, there's also going to be a wired LAN port in the dock, if that's a thing that's
867340	868340	of interest to you.
868340	872940	And oh, a boost in internal storage to 64 gigabytes.
872940	877500	That we're getting there.
877500	880740	That will all be coming out the same day as Metroid Dread.
880740	881780	That's October the 8th.
881780	884880	And it's going to set you back three hundred and fifty dollars for the system.
884880	890100	Now look, if I were to play most of my time in handheld, I'd probably think this is pretty
890100	891100	cool.
891100	897080	I might consider getting one, although since I already have a Switch, I'm not sure I'm
897080	899380	really into it.
899380	903000	But this is going to be great for people who, for whatever reason, still haven't got on
903000	905020	board with the Switch yet.
905020	908140	This is going to be a sweet upgrade for those folks, I think.
908140	911980	But you know, for folks like me who play 95 percent of the time in docked mode, there's
911980	913180	really nothing here.
913180	915580	I mean, one could argue maybe the wired LAN.
915580	920980	You can you can you can get that like as an accessory or whatever.
920980	922940	You can find it separately, too.
922940	923940	Yeah, exactly.
923940	931600	So the biggest surprise in that is that it's not a 4K system and it's not a pro.
931600	933180	It's not a buffed up system.
933180	939860	It's not going to get you more frames on Breath of the Wild or Breath of the Wild 2.
939860	943800	I kind of think, you know, and I said this before a few shows ago, I kind of think what
943800	949820	happened here is that I said this when Nintendo didn't announce anything leading up to E3
949820	953340	and then they came out and said their E3 presentation was specifically they specifically
953340	958680	said software only, no hardware, and then they kind of lied because they had that Zelda
958680	959680	Game and Watch.
959680	961220	But we'll let that one slide.
961220	964420	They very clearly made it known there's not going to be any Switch announcements.
964420	967260	And that was the point where I think I was saying and to be fair, other people, too,
967260	969580	were saying, you know what?
969580	973780	This chip shortage that's going on in the world right now, you you still can't get a
973780	975900	fucking PlayStation five.
975900	977420	Does Nintendo really want to get?
977980	984880	Do you want Nintendo and their hardware folks, which, oh, that can be exhausting sometimes
984880	986700	to try to find Nintendo hardware, right?
986700	989540	Do you want Nintendo to try to release a Switch Pro right now?
989540	994540	Because to be honest, with the chip shortages still going around and stuff, I kind of don't.
994540	999380	I kind of think this is great news that we're not getting a Switch Pro this year because
999380	1001280	I don't want to fight people for one.
1001280	1004800	And I think deep down, most of you don't want to fight people for one either, as much as
1004800	1007600	you may have liked the four K and all that stuff.
1007600	1008600	You know what?
1008600	1010640	Let it bake in the oven for another year.
1010640	1013400	Maybe we'll see something next year instead.
1013400	1016280	Maybe at this point, they just say, screw it.
1016280	1022960	And we get a Switch two or a, you know, a real successor to the Switch console.
1022960	1027320	I oh, my, the Switch, you were getting in the switch.
1027320	1032840	I kind of think I kind of, you know, not to get too far off topic with that, but I kind
1032880	1036080	of think Nintendo is going to stick with the Switch for a while.
1036080	1039800	I think everybody's talking about what would they'll go from the Switch Pro to the next
1039800	1040800	Nintendo console.
1040800	1046460	And I'm kind of like the next Nintendo console will be a switch of some sort.
1046460	1047460	It would.
1047460	1050060	They're going to keep this handheld dock thing going for a while.
1050060	1051060	It might look different.
1051060	1056540	It might have some radical changes, but the whole concept of switch and that that is staying.
1056540	1059400	I would be shocked if they went away from that.
1059400	1062800	But then again, they kind of did that with Wii U, didn't they?
1062800	1065880	They walked away from those motion controllers and look where that got them.
1065880	1067960	So I don't know.
1067960	1070420	Pod Culture in chat says the Super Switch.
1070420	1072840	I think that would be a great name for it.
1072840	1075640	I hope they name the successor better, whatever they do.
1075640	1078060	I think Super Switch is the way to go.
1078060	1080120	It's very clear, very plain.
1080120	1081800	And you know what you're going to get with something like that.
1081800	1087480	But anyway, I digress because that is going to be at least a year down the line at this
1087480	1088480	point.
1088560	1091300	The Super Switch is all we got this year and Nintendo is not going to do something new
1091300	1093040	for this holiday.
1093040	1096440	Let's get to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1096440	1099600	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Shane wants to fight people for one.
1099600	1102960	Now, I'm not going to try to speak for Shane, but I do talk to him a lot.
1102960	1106840	I don't think he's as like I think he kind of got to the point where he's like, all right,
1106840	1108080	I'll get one.
1108080	1112480	But it wasn't something where he was like, oh, like when it was first revealed, he was
1112480	1115920	like, oh, I got to go get in line right now or I don't.
1115920	1119120	And Shane, if you're out there, feel free to text or chat.
1119120	1123360	But that was the impression I got anyway.
1123360	1124360	Let's see.
1124360	1128840	OK, I thought that was I thought that was Shane texting me and that was actually Dark
1128840	1130840	Sakura saying why she went afk.
1130840	1134120	I was like, wow, that was quick.
1134120	1135120	Other comments in chat.
1135120	1140400	S2100 Matt says, to be fair, Nintendo has done well with their IPs, indie titles and
1140400	1143920	so forth that they don't need a Switch Pro this year or even next.
1143920	1145800	See, I'm kind of with you there.
1145800	1150560	Animal Crossing was bananas, and I think they're going to have another great holiday for the
1150560	1152560	system they've got.
1152560	1155900	S2100 Matt continues, a year ago, we were talking about how Animal Crossing was the
1155900	1158000	highest sold game of the pandemic.
1158000	1161880	That game wasn't in 4K, 120 FPS, BBQ.
1161880	1164400	Nintendo can strike gold again on this current hardware.
1164400	1166640	Yeah, I agree.
1166640	1170560	I think it would be even better if I could play Breath of the Wild in 4K.
1170560	1174440	But again, I don't want to fight people for that right now.
1174440	1177000	I still can't get a PlayStation 5 easily.
1177000	1182880	I mean, if I really wanted to work at it and really wanted to camp on websites, like, I guess I
1182880	1184440	could go and get a PlayStation 5.
1184440	1191720	But like, I don't know any other industry, maybe concert tickets where I have to beg to buy one.
1191720	1196200	Like, I will get a PlayStation 5 when I can walk into Target and pick one up off the shelf.
1196200	1200320	Although that's that's that's kind of what I did with Xbox Series X.
1200320	1202040	So, you know, that's why I have one of those.
1202040	1203400	So there is that.
1203400	1205960	Yeah, I'm getting so much use out of my Series X too.
1205960	1208360	So, yeah, I got to be honest.
1208360	1213840	I'm I'm loving the Series X right now for meeting the needs of this current generation.
1213840	1216800	That's not don't don't label Rob Roberts, Xbox fanboy.
1216800	1218640	No, I love all.
1218640	1220680	I want to see everybody succeed.
1220680	1224280	I'm like mean girls when she's splitting up the crown and want to give everybody a piece.
1224280	1225640	OK, that's me with the gaming industry.
1225640	1227760	I want to see everybody succeed.
1227760	1231160	But just as it is right now, the PlayStation 5 is kind of a pain to get.
1231160	1232440	And I don't feel like there's anything.
1232480	1234800	I kind of I really did want to play Returnal.
1234800	1236680	I was at the first game where I was like, oh, I really need.
1236680	1240600	And I think once some more of these games start coming out, like Final Fantasy 16, that's
1240600	1243080	going to come out eventually, but not this year.
1243080	1246760	But if it's out next holiday, oh, I'm fucking buying a PlayStation 5 because you better
1246760	1251320	believe you better believe I'm playing Final Fantasy 16 when it's by the folks who did
1251320	1258120	14, which I think is probably the best Final Fantasy game they've made at this point.
1258120	1259600	It's just incredible.
1259600	1266040	So let's see, Pod Culture in chat says, if I could find someone willing to pay full boat
1266040	1270280	for my Mario Switch, I'd consider upgrading since I mainly play in handheld.
1270280	1271640	But otherwise, nope.
1271640	1275440	You might be surprised, Pod Culture.
1275440	1278160	People want to still buy those old hardware things.
1278160	1279360	I don't know if you've used it.
1279360	1280440	It might be a little harder.
1280440	1283600	You might not get the full value from it, but you never know.
1283600	1285280	Take a look.
1285280	1290880	And let's say SSG100Matt says, you have better odds winning two of those PlayStation 5s on
1290880	1293240	Summer Game Stunt Quick's giveaway.
1293240	1297440	They even joke on stream most of the staff of GDQ can't get a PS5.
1297440	1302760	Well, I entered because I donated at the end of the Summer Game Stunt Quick there yesterday.
1302760	1304440	So who knows?
1304440	1309040	Maybe I will be lucky enough to win one, but I'm not going to count on it.
1309040	1312740	Questbuster says you can also sign up using your PlayStation account on Sony site and
1312740	1316780	for a chance and an invite reserving your spot for you in a virtual queue.
1316780	1319620	I did that like a year and a half ago.
1319620	1320620	Still.
1320620	1322820	Yeah, I remember that back in September.
1322820	1325940	Never got an email, so.
1325940	1326940	But it's honest.
1326940	1331740	Honestly, if they sent me an invite, I would just say, I don't want one right now.
1331740	1332740	I don't know.
1332740	1333740	I'm saving money.
1333740	1337220	I can't plunk 500 on a console right now, but maybe give it to me.
1337220	1342500	I don't give me $500 and sure, I'll give you a PS5.
1342780	1344580	I would be down for that.
1344580	1348140	You're going to give me $500 and I'll get you a PS5?
1348140	1350620	Yeah, with the $500 I give you.
1350620	1351620	OK.
1351620	1352620	Oh, yeah.
1352620	1353620	If I get my cordial invite.
1353620	1354620	OK.
1354620	1355620	All right.
1355620	1356620	Yes.
1356620	1357620	We'll talk offline.
1357620	1358620	We'll talk.
1358620	1359620	All right.
1359620	1360620	Questbuster says I got an invite, but they ran out.
1360620	1361620	So.
1361620	1362620	Oh, my God.
1362620	1366420	Can you imagine getting invited to like Disneyland to ride a new ride or something and then you
1366420	1369180	get all the way down there and they're like, it broke.
1369180	1373100	So is this like the reservation for the car from Seinfeld?
1373100	1378780	You know, it's like I don't think you understand what a reservation means.
1378780	1381500	Or it's oh, oh, oh, what's the other terrible one?
1381500	1382580	I don't know what you're talking about.
1382580	1383740	I've never watched that show.
1383740	1385500	No, I can relate, though.
1385500	1390420	You book a seat on a flight and you don't actually have a seat on the flight.
1390420	1395320	And then they're like, sorry, we're bumping you because we oversold the flight.
1395320	1396820	It's that.
1396820	1398260	Gross.
1398260	1405300	Anyway, that's when I turn into Major Karen and raise some hell.
1405300	1407220	At least we have a kitty on stream now.
1407220	1408220	It's nice to see.
1408220	1409220	Anyway.
1409220	1411020	It was staring me down.
1411020	1415580	Any anyone here on the hosting panel considering a Nintendo OLED switch?
1415580	1416580	No.
1416580	1417580	OK.
1417580	1418580	No.
1418580	1422140	Unless the kids break mine, which is a distinct possibility.
1422140	1423260	Don't encourage them, Loki.
1423260	1425940	If they overhear that, they don't have to encourage them.
1425940	1429260	Thankfully they've been playing mostly Roblox stuff.
1429260	1430900	So they haven't really been playing the switch.
1430900	1436900	But I'm sure we'll get the new Zelda game and the remastered Zelda game.
1436900	1438700	So yeah.
1438700	1439700	Hold up.
1439700	1443960	Mike Defton chat says PlayStation fives here cost fifteen thousand Mexican pesos.
1443960	1446340	That's about seven hundred and fifty dollars USD.
1446340	1448300	But at least you can find them more easily.
1448300	1453260	So you mean I can walk into I don't know what the big electronic stores are in Mexico.
1453260	1456540	I'll assume we live in a world where fries still exist in Mexico.
1456540	1461520	So I can still walk into fries Mexico and pick up a PlayStation five off the shelf.
1461520	1466660	I just have to pay like, you know, 250 extra dollars for it, which totally goes against
1466660	1468900	everything I believe in when it comes to scalpers anyway.
1468900	1472180	But at least at least in that scenario where they're kind of importing things, it makes
1472180	1473540	a little more sense.
1473540	1475060	Mike Defton says maybe.
1475060	1476060	Wow.
1476060	1477060	Wow.
1477060	1478060	All right.
1478060	1479060	Interesting.
1479060	1483660	Well, Tiger cloud does remind us the switch OLED is not going to make the games play better.
1483660	1487220	Sure it has a better screen, but it's not going to improve the quality of the games,
1487220	1489120	but they'll look better.
1489120	1492540	That's what's not on your TV, though, won't affect us.
1492540	1493540	Look at that.
1493540	1494540	That's true.
1494540	1495540	Not on your TV.
1495540	1497100	And the Tiger also brings up the joy cons.
1497100	1499300	They're the same as the original switch.
1499300	1500740	So they didn't fix the drift problem.
1500740	1501740	Oh, yes.
1501740	1503820	I heard somebody would have learned by now.
1503820	1508740	I heard somebody asked Nintendo directly about that and got like a no comment in response,
1508740	1510260	which means, yes, it's the same.
1510260	1511260	And they haven't.
1511260	1513540	How how have they not fixed the same?
1513540	1514540	That's setting themselves.
1514540	1516460	Oh, oh, that's a choice.
1516460	1517460	That is a choice.
1517460	1518460	Nintendo.
1518460	1519460	That is a choice.
1519460	1520460	All right.
1520460	1526340	Speaking of choices, I made a very good choice by having Alan go to Costco before the show
1526340	1529740	because he put down in front of me earlier a churro from Costco.
1529740	1536180	So I have a Costco churro that I'm going to chow down on while Dark Soccer tells us about
1536180	1537180	her gaming week.
1537180	1538180	So how was your get?
1538180	1541140	What are the choices you made with your gaming week this week, Dark Soccer?
1541140	1544680	Still no Animal Crossing.
1544680	1551700	Basically it's been Dead by Daylight and Fantasian, but when I was streaming Fantasian, my Internet
1551700	1553340	cut out was sad.
1553340	1557860	I'm really in that grindy part where I need to buff up a couple of my characters so I
1557860	1563740	may not play it on stream anymore for a little bit until I finish the buffing.
1563740	1568340	So it's really been mostly Dead by Daylight.
1568340	1577780	I've been participating in the event and bringing out my cake and I have not yet gotten a five
1577780	1579640	cake match.
1579640	1587020	I got a four cake match and some jackass brought escape cake, which doesn't help me at all.
1587020	1588780	How very dare they?
1588780	1595420	I'm playing my worst games and of course we have pinball going on, so that's it.
1595420	1596420	All right.
1596420	1598500	Have you gotten some killer crowns?
1598500	1606180	Oh, I got all the killer crowns, which I mean, for the characters that you can get them.
1606180	1610760	I did pick up a couple of survivor perks just in case it happens.
1610760	1616260	So I got like live and dead hard because everyone either uses live or dead hard.
1616260	1618260	So I figured, huh?
1618740	1629780	Um, but other than that, um, I, I've just been, I got my crown on twins and it's enough
1629780	1633020	to know that I hate playing twins.
1633020	1638980	I hate playing Blort, who will always be called Blort to me.
1638980	1640100	Oh, he is hard.
1640100	1642660	He's harder than nurse in many ways.
1642660	1643660	Yeah.
1643660	1644660	Yeah.
1645060	1649820	As a nurse, it's just a matter of getting, uh, getting used to how the blinks work, which
1649820	1650820	I do have to show.
1650820	1657420	I don't remember their names, but these, uh, I, I think that they realized that I was legit
1657420	1661900	a baby nurse and it was right before end game collapse.
1661900	1667420	A couple of, uh, a couple of, uh, survivors actually just, I could tell that's what they
1667420	1668420	were doing.
1668420	1672340	They were letting me practice my blinks.
1672340	1673880	And I thought that was really nice.
1674100	1678640	You know, usually I get nothing but, you know, sweaty, toxic survivors who like to do the
1678640	1681520	butt dance and, you know, act like children.
1681520	1688640	Um, which to me I think is unnecessary and probably a skilled player shouldn't do that
1688640	1689960	if they're mature.
1689960	1694640	Um, but at any rate, um, they were really nice.
1694640	1696760	They just let me run around.
1696760	1700480	They seem to know I got a couple of hits in, it was pretty cool.
1700520	1706360	I would just let one run off and go after the other and let, you know, we just run around
1706360	1709400	all of the Yamaoka estate and it was pretty cool.
1709400	1710400	Yeah.
1710400	1711920	Um, I had some interesting matches.
1711920	1713880	I was playing as killer as well.
1713880	1719480	And um, you know, some were like, I played a few pyramid head matches and in one match,
1719480	1720480	like they did not want it.
1720480	1721600	Like it was a five cake match.
1721600	1723000	They did not want to farm.
1723000	1726120	I was like, I was out in the middle drawing circles.
1726120	1728000	I'm like, come here and let's farm.
1728000	1729700	They didn't want to do it.
1729740	1732860	And so, but then I got another one where some idiot DC'd right.
1732860	1736780	Well, maybe it wasn't their fault, but they DC'd right when the match started and I ended
1736780	1739260	up unintentionally slugging the other three.
1739260	1744220	I didn't mean to, but I actually, I picked one up and let them get out so they could
1744220	1745220	go pick somebody up.
1745220	1746860	And I was like, all right, we're going to farm.
1746860	1747860	Then here's the punchline.
1747860	1750980	So they finally get the door open and then I get booted from the game.
1750980	1753120	I think my game freezes and I get DC'd.
1753120	1754300	So you know how many blood points I got?
1754300	1755300	Zero.
1755300	1756300	I'm so mad.
1756300	1760140	I'm going to play the DVD for the rest of the day because behavior has made a great
1760140	1763700	game that runs like garbage.
1763700	1769940	You know, I did, I did actually have an interesting match and it was actually one of the, it was,
1769940	1774580	I think my third time playing Freddy and I actually had a really good one.
1774580	1782660	I had, uh, one DC, two kills and I was about to get a Meg and I closed the hatch by accident.
1782660	1784780	I was going to let her go.
1784780	1789180	And so she's slugged, no one to heal her.
1789180	1794180	And I can't open the gate once the apparently once the hatches closed, you can't open the
1794180	1795180	gate.
1795180	1796180	Right.
1796180	1802580	So what I did is I picked her up and ran around until she got down and then we went and hung
1802580	1806900	back over by the gate so I could let her out or she could let herself out.
1806900	1812660	But you know, it was, it was, that also had like one of the most annoying Dwight's ever.
1813060	1814060	It was great.
1814060	1815060	Hanging that guy.
1815060	1816060	All right, I'm done.
1816060	1817060	All right.
1817060	1818060	Enough dead by daylight.
1818060	1819060	Let's go to somebody who doesn't play that game.
1819060	1820060	Let's go to Loki.
1820060	1821060	Loki, how was your game?
1821060	1822060	I don't play that game.
1822060	1823060	You don't play that game.
1823060	1824060	What do you play?
1824060	1825060	It's just Minecraft.
1825060	1829500	And so that's what I've been doing, just still playing on the server.
1829500	1832760	Mainly this week was just finishing up the design of the build that I'm going to be working
1832760	1834780	on here pretty soon.
1834780	1838140	I think also gathering resources for that as well.
1838140	1846020	So there was actually a lot of mining being done and harassing the server admins about
1846020	1850100	our spawn rates because we were, we've had an issue and I brought it up in my last video
1850100	1857860	where no mobs were spawning, which kind of makes it hard to run a mob farm that requires
1857860	1859380	those mobs to be spawning.
1859380	1863000	And so it's been like fixed and broken all throughout the week.
1863000	1865660	So I think it's now finally actually working again.
1865660	1874020	But that kind of put a lot of my plans I had to make other mob farms on hold for a while.
1874020	1879020	Also with my new shop they have, which sells axolotls, they have the rare blue one, which
1879020	1883860	prior to 117.1, you could actually just find those in the wild.
1883860	1890020	And so I was actually planning on building a upgraded farm to farm those because otherwise
1890020	1896700	you have to breed them and it's like a one in 1200 chance of getting one and it's a real
1896700	1898420	pain in the ass to do that.
1898420	1902860	So unfortunately, now that we've updated the 117.1, that is my only option.
1902860	1907300	So I'm going to raise the price on those.
1907300	1909340	But yeah, it's mainly been just Minecraft.
1909340	1915540	So now I'm finally getting to the point where I'm going to start that build for my new video.
1915540	1916880	Had to terraform a bunch of stuff.
1916880	1919860	So that's taken a long time because it's a massive build.
1919900	1927020	It's like 40 blocks by 42 and I think 70 tall, just this massive factory.
1927020	1928860	So I'm going to be doing that.
1928860	1935260	And then I don't know from there, I've been trying to get more people involved with like
1935260	1941540	doing streaming or like content creation, but it's like it's not happening, which is
1941540	1947560	very disappointing, especially not to complain, but I'm going to.
1947560	1953600	We had somebody leave our server and apparently they're an admin or they run their own other
1953600	1959640	another SMP and the guy started off his brand new YouTube channel and it's already getting
1959640	1967160	like 1000 views per video, just a brand new thing, which is frustrating when you have
1967160	1973440	a hermit from hermitcraft in your episode and you can't pull more than 200 views.
1973440	1974640	A little frustrating.
1974640	1978200	So I will keep at it, stick at it.
1978200	1981160	You just, you never know the one that's going to catch fire.
1981160	1982420	You just have to stick with it.
1982420	1983560	That's all it is.
1983560	1985760	It's hard because I gotta put the cat down.
1985760	1986760	It's hard.
1986760	1987760	Put the cat in the video.
1987760	1989600	I bet you'll get a lot of hits for that.
1989600	1990600	Oh, gosh.
1990600	1991600	Stella plays Minecraft.
1991600	1994400	She's shedding like crazy.
1994400	2000400	So it's hard because like a server like that, where you have a lot of people on that server
2000400	2004280	actually doing content creation, they share their view, their audience.
2004280	2008800	And so each person may bring in like a hundred people or so, and then you're sharing audiences
2008800	2011000	and that's how you grow grandically.
2011000	2014600	That was the hope when I joined the server that, Oh, Hey, there's multiple people making
2014600	2015600	content.
2015600	2019240	And when I came on, that was the case, there was a few people had a couple episodes.
2019240	2022000	Now there's nobody, it's just like, it's just me.
2022000	2026720	And so the only con the only audience I can grow is the people that are on the server
2026720	2028440	watching themselves.
2028440	2034640	And then maybe anybody else I can try to like get in with advertising on a bunch, like on
2034640	2038140	different discords, like I'm on a bunch of the hermit's discord.
2038140	2039740	So they have like media sharing things.
2039740	2044000	So I posted in there, I posted forums, I posted on Twitter, social media, like everywhere.
2044000	2048120	And it's just nothing like, it's just nothing, but I'm going to keep at it.
2048120	2049820	It's just, it's frustrating.
2049820	2050820	Change your server.
2050820	2054920	If it, if it isn't, if everybody abandoned ship, then yeah, but I can't, I don't want
2054920	2059760	to right now, but just because they like the other server, it would have like had that
2059760	2064720	sort of been in existence at the time, I probably would have joined something like that, but
2064720	2069240	there's like so many, it's hard to say like how it would have even gone, but we'll see.
2069240	2074760	I just am a little frustrated seeing like, cause not to like dog on like people and in
2074760	2079760	the quality of their content, but like his video was bad.
2079760	2084760	His audio was terrible and yeah, he's pulling in 900 reviews on this first feels like that's
2084800	2085800	frustrating.
2085800	2087840	Like that is absolutely frustrating.
2087840	2088840	Aren't you?
2088840	2091040	Aren't you used to it by now from this podcast?
2091040	2097080	Like I'm not, I'm not saying high quality podcast or anything, but I heard some of the
2097080	2098080	ones that have caught fire though.
2098080	2101720	I will never forget the one I listened to and this is a very popular show and no, I'm
2101720	2106280	not going to name it because I am not that kind of person, but I listened to it and I'm
2106280	2110280	like, this guy sounds like he's being held prisoner and doesn't want to be here talking
2110280	2113460	about these retro games.
2113460	2118540	This guy does not sound like he wants to be here at all and I just, I was so bored because
2118540	2121640	he was bored and it was like infectious and all that stuff.
2121640	2125020	So I don't understand sometimes how some of these like bigger names and things that catch
2125020	2128260	fire, uh, do as well as they do.
2128260	2129260	So yeah.
2129260	2132940	And I don't know either lucky to have what we have and I do mean it.
2132940	2133940	We do.
2133940	2135860	I just, I, I understand that.
2135860	2140700	I just wish the community that I played with would stop leaving the server and I wish that
2140700	2145640	they would actually play and like check cause like this entire week when I was playing,
2145640	2149580	there was nobody on and I get it like fourth of July holiday and stuff like that.
2149580	2152940	Probably people were gone during the week or vacationing during the summer, but like
2152940	2156340	nobody was on, it was just me period.
2156340	2163300	Like it's starting to, it's starting to look like the VoG Minecraft server where it's just
2163300	2164300	like started off.
2164300	2168300	I got like a few people playing and it was like doing all that and then nobody.
2168300	2169300	So it's like,
2169300	2175300	I need a button for that shade sound from RuPaul's drag race.
2175300	2178340	I have a button actually.
2178340	2179340	It's frustrating.
2179340	2181140	I just, I wish we got more engagement.
2181140	2183660	I wish we had more people playing and stuff like that.
2183660	2189460	And I know like I get individuals on the server reaching out and saying, Hey, you know, you
2189460	2190600	know, we want to do voice chat.
2190600	2191820	We can do that or something like that.
2191820	2193660	But like these people are never on it.
2193660	2194660	I don't know.
2194660	2195660	We'll see.
2195660	2199060	I just have to stick it with it for now, but like it's getting frustrating.
2199100	2201580	For what it's worth, you have some nice folks in chat.
2201580	2205100	Bobby Blackwell says you're the only Minecraft YouTuber I watch.
2205100	2208660	And Mike Deft uses the arrow to kind of indicate the same thing there.
2208660	2211860	She Hulk suggests get a cat cam and the money will pour in.
2211860	2214660	That's that's what I'm saying, you know.
2214660	2219660	And again, to get a cat cam or a hot tub, hot tub Minecraft stream, Loki.
2219660	2222460	I'm going to sink money in for a hot tub.
2222460	2223460	Why don't you?
2223460	2224460	Okay.
2224460	2229260	Build a hot tub in Minecraft and call it your Minecraft hot tubs video.
2229260	2235260	And then make the thumbnail something completely different.
2235260	2245100	Well, it's like on TikTok, my highest hitting my two highest videos is one where I'm watching
2245100	2252260	Oscar, you know, a WWE talk about her TikTok channel and one of me petting Midna.
2252860	2257060	The OK, I'm a little older, so I just turned 43.
2257060	2259660	I'm having a hard time understanding the tic tac.
2259660	2264300	But all I know is that somebody older than you, somebody somebody told me to start one
2264300	2265860	the last time I was at Rocky Horror.
2265860	2271660	So pre pandemic and I did a really dumb little video on there and it has like 550 views.
2271660	2278660	I'm like, OK, for like not I was like, so maybe I need to explore the taktaks a little
2278660	2279660	more.
2279660	2285660	I've been I've been putting up like some of my my clips from my channel and sometimes
2285660	2291460	I'll like set them to an intro outro with some of my own music on it.
2291460	2294060	I've seen that come through my feet, actually.
2294060	2297060	So it gets it gets seen.
2297060	2299660	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I joined TikTok.
2299660	2300860	I haven't posted yet.
2300860	2307060	I'm telling you, Bobby, post that little rap that you did or Micro Machines spiel that
2307060	2310360	you did at Games Done Quick on TikTok.
2310360	2313860	And that would probably get a lot of views, although to be fair, since it's really about
2313860	2317460	the charity, I don't know if Games Done Quick runs a TikTok, but maybe they should have
2317460	2318460	it.
2318460	2321660	But I that would spread, I bet, because that was really good.
2321660	2322660	All right.
2322660	2323660	Well, I'll stop.
2323660	2324660	I'll stop complaining.
2324660	2328120	But like, yeah, so that that video will be coming very soon, depending on how long it
2328120	2334660	takes to build this thing, because it's it's big, but it's pretty cool, I thought.
2335260	2339260	And this is J100 Matt giving some advice, saying if your goal is to get rich quick with
2339260	2342560	YouTube, it's going to take a while and a lot of dedication.
2342560	2344760	Just got to keep grinding and you will get the hits.
2344760	2346060	The key is posting consistently.
2346060	2349060	Well, not to speak for Loki because he's right there, but I don't think it's about getting
2349060	2350060	rich quick.
2350060	2354960	I think it's just about can we find some new people to, you know, can we can we get more,
2354960	2356120	you know, people to see this stuff?
2356120	2358660	It's about visibility, I guess, maybe a better word.
2358660	2359660	Yeah, it's visibility.
2359660	2360660	Yeah.
2360660	2361660	Yeah.
2361660	2363460	I'm not looking to get rich.
2363460	2366560	I mean, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
2366560	2368560	No, it's just to get visibility.
2368560	2372560	I basically just like I want to see like more organic growth.
2372560	2375560	I do want to I'm trying to post consistently.
2375560	2380160	I think I need to scale well, over scoping again, you know, I need to scale back your
2380160	2381160	project size.
2381160	2382160	Yeah, me.
2382160	2383160	Yeah.
2383160	2386960	But I've been trying to like, do like stuff that's interesting, you know, and I get a
2386960	2387960	lot.
2387960	2388960	It depends on the style.
2388960	2392460	Like there's some people that will do large builds each video.
2392460	2397460	There's some people they'll just like kinda more old school where it's like, okay, and
2397460	2398660	I'm wandering around.
2398660	2402960	It depends on like, I have to do large builds because I have no one to interact with that.
2402960	2408460	That's why if it was just like, I'm going to goof off with this person, then yeah, I
2408460	2409460	could do that.
2409460	2413760	But you have to have other people to interact with in order to be able to do that type of
2413760	2419160	content that's I don't have that and it's it's just all me I've got to I've got to build
2419160	2420160	big things.
2420160	2424560	Somebody wants to goof off with Loki and Minecraft and have some fun.
2424560	2426560	Hit him up on Twitter at Loki O.L.R.
2426560	2427560	Yes.
2427560	2432560	And we'll we'll have you join the server because there's people there's people coming in every
2432560	2433560	day.
2433560	2439460	There's got to be somebody listening here who still plays Minecraft who would enjoy
2439460	2444160	just spending an hour playing with you and doing stupid builds building the hot tub in
2444160	2445160	Minecraft.
2445160	2446160	Yeah.
2446160	2447160	All right.
2447160	2449060	My gaming week.
2449060	2451260	So I already played Dead by Daylight.
2451260	2452260	I talked about that.
2452260	2454960	I've been playing more Final Fantasy 14 because of course this is me.
2454960	2458560	They just released a benchmark for Endwalker the next expansion.
2458560	2461960	That was some big news from this weekend that I don't think is on our show roll.
2461960	2466400	So you can check that out on the official Final Fantasy 14 website if you just want
2466400	2468700	to play around with the character creator.
2468700	2473420	So I've actually made my male Viera or my boy bunny who I've just well should I say
2473420	2474420	that?
2474420	2475420	No I'm not going to say the name.
2475420	2477500	I'm going to have to wait because I need to make sure I can get the name before I say
2477500	2479380	it because sometimes people will steal it.
2479380	2481740	But I have a really good name picked out.
2481740	2483860	So we'll have that.
2483860	2485560	And yeah my character looks really cool.
2485560	2489700	So I like the benchmark and otherwise still just trying to get all my characters to 80
2489700	2493440	before the expansion comes out in Final Fantasy 14.
2493440	2498520	Another game I ever played when I'd name I'd name her little bunny boo boo little walking
2498520	2499700	through the forest scooping up.
2499700	2504420	I like that right.
2504420	2511500	So I found I found another game to play this week and it's just I don't know how I found
2511500	2517020	this game all by myself completely unprovoked or told that I should check this out just
2517020	2518020	out of the blue.
2518020	2521120	I found myself checking out Yakuza like a dragon.
2521120	2522980	I checked out on Xbox Game Pass.
2522980	2523980	OK.
2523980	2526100	Obviously I'm saying that very tongue in cheek because people have been yelling at
2526100	2531500	me for a very long time that I need to a play the Yakuza series B specifically this
2531500	2533440	entry in the Yakuza series.
2533440	2538040	So I finally around the Fourth of July holiday downloaded it because finally the bandwidth
2538040	2539140	rolled over.
2539140	2543000	And since we were out of town for a couple of days we didn't use bandwidth.
2543000	2546040	So I was like OK this is a good time for me to download Yakuza.
2546040	2553240	So I did and I've been playing it a lot since the fourth I'm already like 10 hours into
2553240	2554240	the game.
2554380	2558980	Somewhere into like Chapter 4 at this point and I'm having a good time.
2558980	2564980	Like it's it's it's I was not prepared for I knew the Yakuza was very story heavy.
2564980	2567700	I wasn't really prepared for how story heavy it is.
2567700	2573220	I was very like wow there is like a lot going on here and there's a lot of especially in
2573220	2575020	the first chapter.
2575020	2580260	It's a lot of just watching it's like a very persona kind of intro where it's like or Kingdom
2580260	2581740	Hearts 2.
2581740	2587380	You're just watching cut scene after cut scene after cut scene with like maybe three battles
2587380	2589040	in the entire chapter.
2589040	2593080	But it wasn't bad like I found myself kind of like fascinated like what's going on what's
2593080	2594080	going to happen.
2594080	2598800	What's you know and all this there's already like twists and things like that happening.
2598800	2603480	So yeah I'm not going to spoil anything but yes I played enough to get to Chapter 4 where
2603480	2606460	things start to open up and there's side quests.
2606460	2610800	And because I think because this is a Sega game or whatever there are some crazy ass
2610800	2612660	side quests like I laughed my ass off.
2612660	2618100	There's one where you get in a little bicycle and you drive around collecting cans and it's
2618100	2621180	like a little racer game that's built into it.
2621180	2625460	I haven't really dinked around at the Sega arcades or pachinko machines but I know that's
2625460	2628580	a full other thing too that's in the game.
2628580	2633020	And then there's just like all these weird little side things that you can do.
2633020	2635040	That's pretty cool.
2635040	2636980	The game is dirty as hell.
2637420	2643200	This is basically an NC-17 rated Final Fantasy game is what it is.
2643200	2652660	It's Final Fantasy 15 and that bro quest if it was NC-17 rated is kind of what it is honestly.
2652660	2654000	It's dirty.
2654000	2658720	It's violent.
2658720	2665920	It's got sex sex sex sex all over it and everything is boring.
2665920	2670120	There's violence and a lot of uses of the F word as well.
2670120	2671120	It's everything.
2671120	2677340	All the nasty stuff you can think of it's there.
2677340	2682140	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's a Japanese crime drama continually interrupted by episodes
2682140	2683500	of The Simpsons.
2683500	2685500	That's a very good way of putting it.
2685500	2692840	So on my Twitter I put a game capture because like I was doing a side quest and I was like
2692840	2697800	look I've hosted the Rocky Horror Picture Show for like years and years and years.
2697800	2700180	I've done a lot of you know other cult cinema.
2700180	2703180	I've even hosted a horror movie fest and everything.
2703180	2706780	It takes a lot to like make me go what the fuck is this.
2706780	2711380	But there was a scene that happened in Yakuza where I was like what the fuck is this.
2711380	2712960	Like what in the act.
2712960	2714780	This is in my video game.
2714780	2716320	This is happening.
2716320	2719620	And it was it was basically a side quest in this economy.
2719620	2723520	It was a side quest where you hear like a baby crying.
2723520	2727160	And so it's a really short quest and this does not spoil the main story whatsoever.
2727160	2730920	If you are really going to be hurt that I'm spoiling one tiny little side quest then I'm
2730920	2731920	sorry.
2731920	2734580	That was also done in a speed run.
2734580	2738240	But so what happened on the side quest you hear a baby cry.
2738240	2739240	No this is not rugby baby.
2739240	2740240	That's different Yakuza game.
2740240	2741240	Oh that was different.
2741240	2742240	OK.
2742240	2743240	Yeah.
2743240	2744600	There's a baby crying upstairs or something.
2744600	2748840	And you have a guy who has baby formula.
2748840	2752020	Long story short you decide you're going to take the baby formula up to the crying
2752020	2753980	baby but you need hot water.
2753980	2757420	So the side quest is you got to go to the cafe get the hot water come back and then
2757420	2763020	you go upstairs and you find out that the babies that are crying are grown men and they're
2763020	2769500	wearing diapers and they're being it's a fetish studio or something that you just walked in
2769500	2770500	and crash.
2770500	2775060	And because these guys happen to be rival Yakuza then the surprise in the side quest
2775060	2778300	is these babies want to kick your ass basically.
2778300	2783180	So you have to fight these man babies and then at the end you get to make a very Bioware
2783180	2790320	esque choice on do you want to run out of there.
2790320	2795240	Do you want to tell them off or whatever or do you want to join them and have a bottle
2795240	2798080	together with them.
2798080	2801800	And so of course I picked the option where I wanted to have a bottle with them and the
2801800	2803760	screen just fades to black at that point.
2803760	2805680	So there was that.
2805700	2809340	And Bobby Blackwell says yes and then he becomes a summon.
2809340	2814060	So that is a whole other thing is that instead of summons like Final Fantasy you have people
2814060	2818180	you call on your phone that show up for money and kick people's ass.
2818180	2825780	And so a man baby fetish dude is one of the people that you can call when you're in trouble.
2825780	2831740	Let's see Mike Defton chat says that's an actual thing in Japan not not just Japan.
2831740	2832740	Did you see my response.
2832740	2834080	Yes I did.
2834080	2839020	There's a Web site called Craigslist and there's a there's a well not sadly not anymore.
2839020	2842320	There's other where one Web site goes down others go up.
2842320	2848320	So yes there's there's players and kink Web sites out there that are for networking and
2848320	2849680	yes it's a thing.
2849680	2855120	And I'm not here to shame nobody and what they want to do consensually behind closed
2855120	2856160	doors.
2856160	2860620	I just was not expecting to see that in a video game like you know there's a lot of
2860620	2863920	plot twists and I can call a lot of plot twists.
2863920	2866600	That was not a plot twist I was prepared for OK.
2866600	2867720	That's just all I'm saying.
2867720	2872740	But yeah yeah whatever you want to do consensually behind closed door y'all's business.
2872740	2878860	That is that is y'all all right anyway.
2878860	2882400	So that's my long story about my experience of the Yakuza like a dragon.
2882400	2885840	But I am I am enjoying it and the story is is good.
2885840	2889480	And yeah now I'm curious to go back and check out other Yakuza games.
2889660	2894460	Although I hear that the other get zero through six.
2894460	2895460	Is it.
2895460	2896900	And this this would kind of be seven I guess.
2896900	2900180	So zero through six are like beat them ups.
2900180	2901900	So they're different.
2901900	2907220	But but I think the main part of it with the crazy story twists the things I'm talking
2907220	2910260	about that part is still all the same.
2910260	2914440	It's just the actual what happens when you get in the encounters with band dude bad dudes
2914440	2915440	is a little bit.
2916100	2921700	Didn't a couple of them have Kitano Takeshi doing some roles.
2921700	2922700	I think so.
2922700	2925460	I think he's in that rugby baby scene.
2925460	2926460	Yeah he was.
2926460	2933100	But he's also been like one of his big claims to fame was doing you know Yakuza movies.
2933100	2934100	You know.
2934100	2935100	Yeah.
2935100	2936860	So anyway it's it's a fascinating game.
2936860	2942820	Actually Jamie if you could you know just look away at some of the nasty stuff.
2942820	2944220	Well you're you're in a grown adult.
2944220	2945220	You can look right at it.
2945220	2948200	It's just one of those things where it's like I think if you can kind of get through some
2948200	2953360	of the weird shit there's a lot of lore in the game and I know you love lore and there's
2953360	2956440	a lot to the story there are some interesting shit in it.
2956440	2960140	So I got to say it might be worth your time especially if you have game pass.
2960140	2961220	It's worth checking out.
2961220	2965160	So yeah and I don't and I don't really touch our PS4.
2965160	2970720	Oh this is actually I'm playing on Xbox but yeah I don't have a new Xbox plus when I have
2970720	2971720	was a 360.
2971720	2972720	I don't.
2972720	2975500	It's not on 360 bummer.
2975500	2979140	I don't know if I honestly I haven't cared.
2979140	2980140	I'll be honest.
2980140	2982020	Well that's not the kind of game I'm into.
2982020	2985580	I put it off for a long time too and then I was like oh this is kind of fun.
2985580	2987260	Oh PC version is coming.
2987260	2988260	Got it.
2988260	2989260	Got it.
2989260	2990260	Well who's on the PC.
2990260	2991260	I'm not.
2991260	2992260	That's right.
2992260	2993260	That's right.
2993260	2994260	I keep forgetting you.
2994260	2998060	Well you still play stuff through.
2998060	3000060	I'm going to put it this way.
3000080	3002480	I don't even like to watch many Yakuza movies.
3002480	3003480	All right.
3003480	3004480	Fair enough.
3004480	3008520	It's not something I am interested in at all.
3008520	3010560	But thank you.
3010560	3015120	But for it to clarify for others out there who may be curious Mike Deaf does say it is
3015120	3016440	on X cloud.
3016440	3018360	So their their version of that.
3018360	3021240	So that would allow you to play it on pretty much any any device there.
3021240	3022240	So interesting.
3022240	3023240	Interesting.
3023240	3024240	Yeah.
3024240	3026320	Questmaster says the protagonist zero through six is more serious.
3026320	3029560	His persona only makes the bizarre side quests and activities even better.
3029560	3034100	That would be my one read on the game is the one my one little thing is that I do get
3034100	3039380	very frustrated that the main character is to put it bluntly like an idiot a dumbass.
3039380	3042500	He's completely wow.
3042500	3046220	And I get very frustrated sometimes I'm watching these cut scenes where I'm like let me have
3046220	3052380	a human bowling ball what like playing a human bowling ball much pretty much.
3052380	3057060	He's just yeah he's he gets very frustrating in some situations.
3057060	3062640	But my my hope is because I'm because I already kind of see it a little bit that I'm early
3062640	3063640	on in the game.
3063640	3065600	I'm supposed to get irritated with that.
3065600	3069120	But then there's like redemption towards the end of the game where you know he becomes
3069120	3070480	a lot more tolerable.
3070480	3078400	But that's the one little thing where I'm like anyway all right yeah as Joe and Matt
3078400	3082440	says each bonds the lovable idiot I guess his name is number one.
3082440	3083600	Yeah yeah.
3083600	3086760	And people call him out on that in game two which is really funny.
3086760	3088540	They're like no really what's your name.
3088540	3091060	I think it does get funny.
3091060	3092060	It doesn't get funny.
3092060	3093060	All right.
3093060	3094060	Enough enough about that game.
3094060	3095060	Let's talk about other stuff.
3095060	3098600	Oh actually before we get into other news I do want to shout it out like four times
3098600	3104300	now but I want to give officially a shout out to Vogue Network's own Bobby Black Wolf
3104300	3108340	and all the other folks behind the scenes who made summer games done quick that speed
3108340	3109760	running marathon happened.
3109760	3115780	They raised right around two point nine million dollars for Doctors Without Borders a wonderful
3115780	3119720	charity and just lots of great speed runs that were played throughout the week.
3119720	3122760	And of course as you've been hearing on Vogue Network throughout the past few weeks Bobby
3122760	3126360	Black Wolf he's one of the hosts during the event so he's reading donations and things
3126360	3131420	and he was the host with the very last thing that you saw which was that Kingdom Hearts
3131420	3134400	2 speed run where they ran that entire game.
3134400	3139520	I think it was about three hours 12 minutes when all was said and I think the estimate
3139520	3143760	was three hours 15 minutes and it got in right under the estimate.
3143760	3144760	And it was really impressive.
3144760	3146780	And the Sephiroth battle and that other one.
3146780	3152580	Yeah there were those extra battles that he did too which were really all at level one
3152580	3155060	which was the fascinating thing too.
3155060	3159020	And it was great to watch some of the donations come in and hear some of those getting read
3159020	3163100	because my favorite donation that was read they were trying to do the incentive to unlock
3163100	3170220	that Sephiroth battle and somebody donated as Sephiroth and said one v one me.
3170220	3171320	I thought that was really funny.
3171320	3174220	And then the second one that says never mind don't can I have my money back.
3174220	3175220	I did.
3175220	3176220	I heard that one too.
3176220	3177220	That was funny.
3177220	3179340	But I laughed out loud and I heard that whole one v one me.
3179340	3180340	You won't.
3180340	3181340	Yeah.
3181340	3182900	Dan and I had a laugh.
3182900	3184140	That was pretty good.
3184140	3185140	So yeah.
3185140	3186140	No.
3186140	3187140	Great.
3187140	3188140	Great job.
3188140	3189140	Great speed runs.
3189140	3190140	It was it was a good time.
3190140	3191140	So yeah.
3191140	3194920	Looking forward to awesome games done quick which maybe they're going to do in person.
3194920	3199220	They're kind of not committing to that yet which I completely understand because they
3199220	3202400	got to see how things play out in the coming months I'm sure.
3202400	3206600	But they're going to it is on their radar to try to get it back in person in January
3206600	3208220	which they kind of mentioned there at the end.
3208220	3209760	So that would be great if that can happen.
3209760	3210760	So yeah.
3210760	3212420	Dan and I did our donation last night.
3212420	3213420	It didn't get read.
3213420	3214420	But I understand.
3214420	3215420	You know it happens.
3215420	3216420	It happens.
3216420	3220920	But I did say that I love games that have Tron levels in them.
3220920	3222920	Oh there you go.
3222920	3223920	Yeah.
3223920	3224920	Nice.
3224920	3227920	I was waiting the whole thing for the Tron level and it was like over in five minutes.
3228920	3229920	I did.
3229920	3235360	I did have a donation read last night but like the first year I didn't have mine read.
3235360	3238300	So it just depends on what gets through and what doesn't.
3238300	3241140	And you know it all happens.
3241140	3242400	All right.
3242400	3247100	But if you want to hear more about the behind the scenes stuff on what they're looking for
3247100	3251000	and all that stuff I will send you over to the Bobby Blackwell show and given his show
3251000	3255380	a nice cheap plug there which comes on live right before us here at VOG Network or of
3255420	3260140	course he has a robust part podcast archive with lots of stories behind the scenes and
3260140	3263060	all of that as well over at the Bobby Black Wolf show.
3263060	3264060	OK.
3264060	3273780	I want to give Bobby a thank you by the way for doing the debut of my little remix.
3273780	3276300	My my Sanic.
3276300	3278660	So there's another reason to check out a show this week.
3278660	3281820	You'll hear a lot about Summer Games done quick and you get to hear that world premiere
3281820	3288620	of your Sanic Green Hill Zone remix which is which I love the Green Hill Zone music
3288620	3295340	so much that I wanted to pretty much keep it like as the Green Hill Zone music but enhanced
3295340	3297340	if that makes sense.
3297340	3300820	It's Green Hill Zone OLED version.
3300820	3301820	No.
3301820	3304140	All right.
3304140	3305140	Green Hill Zone Pro.
3305140	3306140	It was good.
3306140	3307140	It was good.
3307140	3308140	All right.
3308140	3309140	Let's move on.
3309140	3311220	Let's get into some other gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.
3311620	3312620	OK.
3312620	3313620	We'll start with you.
3313620	3314620	Yeah.
3314620	3320580	So there is actually one of those PlayStation state of play is this week as well.
3320580	3325580	And we got to see some more footage of different games some that we already knew were coming.
3325580	3331220	For example we have a date now for the Death Stranding director's cut which is gonna be
3331220	3336060	September 24th and they kind of showed off some new modes in there as well including
3336060	3341100	a racing mode and also they announced that there's gonna be a $10 upgrade if you have
3341100	3344260	the PlayStation 4 version already and that cross saves will be supported.
3344260	3346340	So that's kind of cool.
3346340	3348900	More footage of Deathloop.
3348900	3354860	I mean we see that almost every single time so that game still looks cool.
3354860	3359700	Lost Judgment looks awesome since we were just talking about Yakuza.
3359700	3364020	Really looking forward to checking that one out when that comes out.
3364020	3365020	What else?
3365020	3374580	We have a new trailer for Jet which looks interesting Jet the Far Shore.
3374580	3379260	It's kind of like a sci-fi adventure game.
3379260	3384220	Fist which you know it's funny it's like I have this game confused with there's another
3384220	3389460	one that just came out about like anthropomorphic animals and stuff like that in like a post
3389460	3391320	apocalyptic setting.
3391320	3395400	I actually thought the one that came out now was this game already but this is a little
3395400	3396400	bit different.
3396400	3400560	This is actually coming out now on PlayStation 4 and 5 and on September 7th.
3400560	3405000	It's a side scroller game but it looks pretty awesome it's about this like rabbit character
3405000	3407760	with this giant mechanical fist he fights with.
3407760	3410280	Oh so it's not Watership Down.
3410280	3411480	No not Watership Down.
3411480	3415160	This Watership Down is like part Bionic Commando I mean that's what it kind of looks like.
3415160	3417360	Watership Down the fighting game.
3417360	3418960	But it looks really cool.
3418960	3423000	So this looks much better than the one that just came out.
3423000	3429520	A new hero shooter called Arcade or Arcade Geddon and that's something that was actually
3429520	3436680	out now in early access so you can check that out and there's a new Moss game coming out
3436680	3442720	so Moss Book 2 which was a game that was originally out on the PlayStation VR.
3442720	3445480	So now that's getting a sequel which is pretty cool.
3445480	3452160	They showed Tribes of Midgard a little bit and a new game called Hunter's Arena Legends
3452160	3455920	which is another battle royale game.
3455920	3456920	What else?
3456920	3457920	Demon Slayer.
3457920	3460200	I don't even know how to pronounce this.
3460200	3468000	The Hinokami Chronicles and yeah I think that's about it.
3468000	3470720	I noticed Seafood Flight Club.
3470720	3474560	That was another game but that's been delayed till 2022 but I know that's something that
3474560	3477120	showed off before.
3477120	3484080	Looks a lot like what was the other I don't remember the name of the game now but yeah
3484080	3485760	it looks familiar.
3485760	3491620	I noticed that even though we had you know a lot of kind of newer IPs and newer ideas
3491620	3495760	and maybe not AAA games but still you know they're games that are on their way out and
3495760	3496960	you know a lot of them look fun.
3496960	3501960	I still noticed that the state of play kind of got a very meh reaction from people online
3501960	3506280	but I kind of again I think this is a case of gamers were setting their expectations
3506280	3511040	a little too high because for yeah I don't know how the fuck this got this started that
3511040	3514440	people were saying oh Final Fantasy 16 has to show up in the state of play.
3514440	3517440	I think people were kind of making the jump.
3517440	3524560	Well because Sony didn't do an E3 presentation this is Sony's E3 presentation.
3524560	3525560	Oh yeah.
3525560	3528520	Therefore they must show Final Fantasy 16.
3529480	3535160	That's where the logic train was going on social media and this really is not what so
3535160	3541080	like again Sony said it was going to be Deathloop footage and some other things.
3541080	3545480	If they were going to show Final Fantasy 16 that would they were not going to bury that
3545480	3548160	lead right.
3548160	3553400	Well yeah exactly and also like I think these are like monthly that they do these state
3553400	3557320	of plays I'm pretty sure that they did one before E3 as well.
3557360	3561960	They've been doing it more regularly than Nintendo Directs to be quite honest.
3561960	3566560	I don't yeah I had no expectations unless you count the indies if you count the indies
3566560	3572620	then they're about the same probably sure but like I don't know it's fine I had no expectations
3572620	3579800	of it I definitely wasn't expecting them announcing major new titles but yeah Deathloop is cool
3579800	3587360	and all but like like I don't I feel like we're we're kind of getting into you know
3587360	3593760	No Man's Sky territory it's not necessarily No Man's Sky but like Last of Us 2 and stuff
3593760	3598020	like we're just like we're we're just shoving the footage down your throat it's like okay
3598020	3602480	dude I've seen Deathloop I get the concept of the game yeah it looks cool I don't need
3602480	3608180	to see 10 minutes of footage every single state of play yeah like it's a little like
3608180	3613620	I get it it's gonna be awesome but I don't need to see it every time like we could have
3613620	3617820	cut that 10 minutes short or like spent 10 minutes promoting something else you know
3617820	3625080	yeah yeah I'm I think there is such a such thing as like too much promotion although
3625080	3630580	Sony did warn you but I think I would say that you know if Sony wanted to do a deep
3630580	3636140	dive on Deathloop then have a state of play or whatever be only that I think maybe the
3636140	3641100	problem there was that they said it was gonna be Deathloop and other stuff so because that
3641100	3644580	other stuff was so vague even though I don't think anybody should have set their bar for
3644580	3648300	Final Fantasy 16 you know if you want to see indies or you want to see you know what are
3648300	3651860	some new games that are PlayStation you know you're gonna tune in and then it's like I
3651860	3656820	have to sit through more of this game I've already seen a million I already pre-ordered
3656820	3663460	it you know but I guess for other people it's hype you know if it was Final Fantasy 16 I'd
3663500	3667540	probably be sitting there gobbling up each and every minute with a spoon so people are
3667540	3672820	into what they're into but I also speaking of that coincidentally there was an interview
3672820	3677100	very recent I think it was actually maybe during the live stream they were doing for
3677100	3682620	Final Fantasy 14 now Kiyoshita who's the producer director of 14 as you all know is
3682620	3689180	also gonna be overseeing 16 because creative unit 3 is working on both and he did say a
3689220	3694860	little bit about 16 and he did say I think he's I don't want to misquote him but it was something
3694860	3700020	along the lines of they may not be at Tokyo Game Show because they don't want to show the game
3700020	3707320	again until basically it's ready and I'm kind of like another example of how Naoki
3707320	3712580	Ashita just like gets it like he just they've announced it and now he doesn't he doesn't want
3712580	3717340	to do the continuous hype for the game he just wants to when it's ready here's the launch trailer
3717340	3723220	type of thing and and then go come out swinging and I think that's a brilliant way to do it but
3723220	3727580	should also kind of set people's expectations now he said that after the state of play but that
3727580	3731220	should also kind of set people's expectations that like you're not gonna see Final Fantasy 16
3731220	3736380	until they're ready to tell you what what day it's coming out well yeah and it's also it makes sense
3736380	3741140	because it's probably a lot of work for them to keep building vertical slices that show off in
3741140	3746300	different trailers of the game just let them develop it without having to constantly put
3746300	3755660	something out that you know the public can consume for sure all right um let's move on
3755660	3761460	and talk about something that will probably not surprise anybody but the fact that they are doing
3761460	3767260	another Assassin's Creed game but it might surprise you how this got unveiled Assassin's
3767260	3774780	Creed infinity is the new game that is coming out and it was leaked out actually at first so
3774860	3781140	what happened is that Bloomberg oh you kids at Bloomberg here you go again but this one they
3781140	3786020	got right so they reported that there is a new entry in the Assassin's Creed series it was going
3786020	3793180	to be a live service game so it kind of cornered Ubisoft into actually confirming this it is called
3793180	3797940	Assassin's Creed infinity internally so I'm sorry I didn't say that I'm specifically earlier this is
3797940	3802860	a code name so it may not be the actual name of the game it's gonna be a collaboration between
3802860	3808940	Ubisoft Montreal and Quebec and Ubisoft in a blog post said rather than continuing to pass the baton
3808940	3813820	from game to game we profoundly believe this is an opportunity for one of Ubisoft's most beloved
3813820	3818820	franchises to evolve in a more integrated and collaborative manner there's really no other
3818820	3823460	details from this so Ubisoft did not respond to anything else that was in the Bloomberg report
3823460	3831900	including that whole live service so that part also still is a rumor at this time such as Grand
3831940	3837500	Theft Auto five anthem those types of games usually of course Assassin's Creed games are
3837500	3842860	single-player even though they're full of DLC so this would be a little bit different the Bloomberg
3842860	3847580	reports isn't there for yeah they have like like almost all of their games are like live service
3847580	3856020	games nowadays you know with what all of their Tom Clancy games right I mean they've got so many live
3856060	3865740	service games it's kind of yuck also Ubisoft is yuck because you know they they basically don't
3865740	3870700	address any of the harassment that's going on their company I was actually gonna follow up with
3870700	3876180	that and kind of say that yeah there's all this news on Assassin's Creed infinity but the deal
3876180	3882540	breaker for a lot of people here is that there's still a lot of really bad stuff trademark patent
3882540	3890340	pending coming out of Ubisoft that seems to show that they perhaps are not addressing some of these
3890340	3896460	issues that have been brought to light prior and that is that is very disappointing and at this
3896460	3902900	point I'm starting to wonder if Eve's given is much longer for the company because this is
3902900	3908860	clearly a problem that's trickling down from the top of course I have sat here and said all these
3908860	3914580	CEOs need to be fired not all of them but a lot of them do and it doesn't seem to happen because
3914580	3918820	I guess the money keeps coming in so I could sit here all day and go Eve's go on needs to go and
3918820	3929140	it probably is not going to happen however it probably should so if you want us to take some
3929140	3934660	of these and it does suck because of course at the end of the day there's a lot of people working
3934860	3940060	very hard on this who are not a part of all of that who are just trying to do what they want to
3940060	3945340	do for a living and that is make a fun video game and they're not a part of all that so it really
3945340	3953140	sucks that you know all this other stuff brings it down but that also highlights the reason why a
3953260	3965820	figure like easy wall needs to go yeah if he really likes his employees he'll resign um let's
3965820	3971460	see going yeah DJ Rama s and chat says friend of mine works at Ubisoft she helped worked on I'm
3971460	3976420	gonna redact that just so that nobody can be identified I hope she doesn't have to deal with
3976420	3982140	this BS I hope not either and again like I said hopefully there's many people within the company
3982140	3986940	who again are just trying to make a good video game and see out their passion of designing video
3986940	3991700	games for a living so it sucks that this has to exist from the company or that this exists within
3991700	3997780	the company and that's why it is the responsibility of the management and the boardroom and the
3997780	4006820	shareholders at this point to cut that out surgically without anesthesia it has gone on
4006820	4017860	too long get in there get it out pod culture says fire them all and start over Mike deaf says
4017860	4021620	Ubisoft but not really Ubisoft more like a subsidiary of them which I think would be game
4021620	4029420	loft oh I think talking about something else sorry let's see Zen monkey says just do battle
4029420	4034500	royale Assassin's Creed and call it a day Ubisoft likes to make their solo play games always online
4034700	4041500	so why not Zen monkey says also Assassin's Creed should do what Grand Theft Auto 5 online is doing
4041500	4045980	just do an online mode and milk it for a few years they honestly don't know what to do with
4045980	4055420	those games um Grand Theft Auto 5 a few years 5 has been going on for it's it's gonna be a few
4055420	4062940	decades by the time they pull the plug on that right Loki right yeah it's been eight years now
4062940	4067660	or almost eight years it's they're not gonna pull the plug on that anytime soon I'm just
4067660	4072860	razzing you and I obviously you had a great comment there I'm just poking fun Zen monkey
4072860	4079620	says yeah more like a decade okay okay we agreed in let's speaking of decades and decades let's
4079620	4086380	throw it back with our next story Dark Sakura so I don't know if anyone remembers this because it's
4086380	4094740	been about 20 years rumored you know now but does anyone remember having heard of the SNK
4094740	4102340	millennium it was supposed to be a console that SNK was working on in theory to complete with the
4102340	4112620	Dreamcast and it had been mentioned around well the rumors came out around 1999 and there was
4112660	4121380	even some mention of it you know that like a couple of statements that there was a home
4121380	4132940	console SNK was working on but someone believes that they found a SNK motherboard that may have
4132940	4140300	belonged to what was becoming the system Anthony Bacon who runs a YouTube channel called video game
4140300	4149020	esoterica did some digging with this PC motherboard and found that it was supposed to be the
4149020	4158020	successor to the hyper neo geo 64 but it doesn't really do a whole lot it has like a very rudimentary
4158020	4165860	BIOS that has the word zombie repeatedly in the code maybe that was like a a work name I guess
4166580	4175420	work in progress project name but with this one yeah like the president of SNK at the time
4175420	4180420	reference that they were working on the SNK millennium and there were some rumors in magazines
4180420	4190420	it was going to license existing CPU technology married to a matrix graph graphics card anyway
4190460	4204700	what he has here is a board that is dated early 1998 and I'm just looking at some of the the
4204700	4211740	pieces on it just to see what was those actually yeah this was writer right before they had to sell
4211740	4218580	the rights to play more so anyway the board takes power doesn't do a lot else the BIOS
4218580	4225060	has like a bunch of just gibberish in it except for the word zombies and plain text every so often
4225060	4231540	but there's no games no files no software development kit no documentation if it runs
4231540	4241340	they don't know what operating system it would run it does use a Hitachi sh4 CPU they think it
4241340	4248380	might just you know run like a hello world message and then that's about it but it is though a nod
4248380	4256100	back to an earlier portion of SNK's history so maybe maybe one day some information will come
4256100	4262700	out about it maybe someone will step in and go hey I know what this is but right now all we have
4262700	4271700	is a kind of a unworking motherboard yeah that's okay made this must have been pulled and stopped
4271700	4277940	working on really really early on for this for so little to really exist on it but it is interesting
4278140	4283820	to think you know well they were thinking that direction and maybe you know especially because
4283820	4288500	you know consoles take so long to develop you know PlayStation Sony is working on PlayStation
4288500	4301580	6 right now it's just you know it's just a matter of you know in 98 99 this would have been close to
4301580	4311100	the time when the Dreamcast launched in Japan okay I mean because the the US release was in
4311100	4322540	99 September 99 99 yeah so it seems to me that they were really thinking ambitiously maybe ahead
4322540	4331780	of themselves we know where that you know left the company ended up I mean I think that it's
4331780	4341580	only more in recent years that SNK is you know done a pretty decent recovery right well we'll
4341580	4346980	see what if maybe somebody will spill the deets on what was going on there and but probably sad
4346980	4350940	we're never gonna see a game I bet I don't think it was really ready for that but you never know
4351500	4360180	all right moving on let's talk about our next story Loki yes as if this was any surprise but
4360180	4369340	we knew that once the acquisition of Bethesda by Microsoft happened that all exclusive deals with
4369340	4375820	Bethesda titles on some platforms were definitely in question I know with like for example the next
4375820	4383700	Elder Scrolls game that will be exclusive on the Xbox platforms as far as consoles go well now of
4383700	4390140	course the one title that they're touting over and over Deathloop is only going to be exclusive on
4390140	4399580	PlayStation for one year so September 14 2022 it'll be out on the Xbox platforms as well but at least
4399580	4411100	they have that one year allegedly allegedly yes on game pass allegedly yeah so we'll see I'm not
4411100	4417700	surprised really if that's the case well most of these exclusive agreements really are for just one
4417700	4423140	year in fact you know kind of going to another Sony exclusive still for now that Final Fantasy
4423140	4428940	7 remake I think many people expected that we would see that on Microsoft's platform now that
4428940	4434620	it's been a year but then oh now we have the PlayStation 5 version and that you know you fee
4434620	4441260	DLC that possibly possibly extended the deal or something we don't really know you know we don't
4441260	4448180	know all the ins and outs of how that worked but it's not on Xbox yet now that story doesn't involve
4448180	4454580	a Microsoft own company like the Deathloop thing does now so I think it's all but certain Deathloop
4454580	4461180	will show up on Xbox eventually but it is interesting to kind of hear the specifics on
4461180	4465940	when you know and you got to wonder if that's gonna make some people wait I don't know I don't
4465940	4471580	know you know do we know how many like PlayStation fives versus Xbox X's are out there I felt like I
4471580	4475420	heard that there's more PlayStation fives but I don't know if that's just because it's adding
4475420	4480740	Japan into it where we know Microsoft is a non factor like I don't know is it pretty even here
4480740	4486860	in the u.s. or is PlayStation still ahead I don't yeah I have no idea honestly like I don't know and
4486860	4491220	it's not really a factor for me though because we can't get PlayStation fives and there's yeah
4491220	4497500	there's a handful of games that are exclusive on there that look pretty awesome but like I mean I
4497500	4502980	was looking forward to the next Elder Scrolls game so I'm glad I have an Xbox why have PC too
4502980	4508460	I guess I could definitely played on that but like you you do bring up an interesting point though
4508460	4513700	where it's like that exclusive window kind of dwindles down when you consider that everybody
4513700	4521260	who can't who wants a ps5 still can't get one and so it makes that window even smaller for when
4521260	4526980	people finally do get a ps5 if you know what I mean true and then deathly balls is also gonna
4526980	4533980	be available on PC so it's really just we're talking console exclusivity so if you want to
4533980	4539300	play to me you can play it on PC as well and I guess to be fair series X's aren't exactly easy
4539300	4545340	to come by either I'm my understanding is they are also having a hard time staying in stock and
4545340	4549940	so forth and I think that's why my brain kind of goes I think they're selling more Playstations
4549940	4556060	because I think they I think I just kind of I feel like most people that wanted an Xbox got one by
4556060	4562220	now but I mean with games pass in the next cloud and stuff like that oh yeah yeah we have to
4562220	4567180	remember Microsoft playing a different game now that's right yeah it's very true so I mean that
4567180	4574740	so let's see what happens so I do want to take a small tangent and I did mention this in chat a
4574740	4580700	little bit yeah sure I'm wondering how future acquisitions and mergers like this are going to
4580700	4586100	go down under the new executive order who I haven't given it much thought I in fact it was
4586100	4594380	the first thing I thought about when I saw the the buyouts and you know when the executive order
4594380	4598900	was announced I was reading through it and I was like this is really gonna stop some of these big
4598900	4604820	video game companies from acquiring the smaller guys just absorbing them I'm sure they'll find
4604820	4610740	loopholes it's I mean they'll find loopholes I'm not familiar enough with the executive order to
4610740	4614260	admittedly I heard that it was going on and I was I was certainly interested in the parts to talk
4614260	4618580	about net neutrality and getting that back and everything but would it seemed like it was meant
4618580	4622740	to close a lot of those loopholes that people have been getting through lately what if it was
4622740	4629620	a Japanese company though that wouldn't it well it would affect business dealings in the US this
4629620	4637180	is though I mean but Microsoft is a US company true true so it would certainly affect them I
4637180	4643300	guess my brain goes to all those you know people that love to have those rumors about Microsoft's
4643340	4647740	gonna buy a Japanese company with all these with all these buyouts they keep doing they're good
4647740	4654660	they're gonna buy Konami you hear that you know way too often sure Konami would love someone to
4654660	4665500	buy them but you know well so the other awesome thing though is the whole elimination of Internet
4665500	4671380	cancellation fees and that one's really big for me mm-hmm so that they'll be better competition
4671380	4677220	for internet providers so people can get basically access to better internet oh so companies can't
4677220	4683900	lock you into two-year agreements anymore I think that it's it's if they do have a contract for it
4683900	4689460	that the what they can charge you would be greatly reduced interesting and that they have to be a
4689460	4695780	hundred percent transparent for each area what their services entail and all of the costs hmm
4695780	4704220	I should read up on this I'm not you'd absolutely read up on it I'll find you the link yeah I also
4704220	4709940	I also I also can Google I don't need I don't need I am one of those people who doesn't need
4709940	4714980	someone else to Google it for me so I wanted to put a link in the chat anyway yeah fair enough
4714980	4720460	all right okay let's move on let's talk about the next story which I'm sorry there's a misspelling
4720460	4725660	there on the sidebar let's talk about The Witcher 3 not Wither 3 that's a different game
4726660	4734900	that's how people feel in front of that actor withered okay so I was just making a pun all
4734900	4742260	right anyway so let's talk about Witcher 3 DLC yes Witcher 3 I think many of us thought that that
4742260	4747340	game is done they're not going back to it why would they cyberpunk is the all the rage now so
4747340	4752780	why would they go back to The Witcher 3 well guess what they are going back to The Witcher 3 they're
4752820	4758140	going to be doing a free next-gen update later this year so that'll be kind of nice I imagine
4758140	4761980	they're not gonna totally you know revamp everything but they'll probably just make
4761980	4766620	it run a little better on the maybe better frame rate maybe some better textures or something
4766620	4774260	lighting ray tracing maybe on the new consoles we'll see but this is all part of Witcher con they
4774260	4778500	did announce that there will be a free next-gen updates that is kind of cool too is that you know
4778500	4783060	because many of you probably picked up The Witcher 3 for like 20 bucks for everything or God maybe
4783060	4789420	even cheaper at some point so it'll be a free upgrade and there's going to be DLC and it's
4789420	4796380	going to also be free and it's going to be inspired by the Netflix version of the series
4796380	4800620	which is really about the books and not the games but they didn't say a little more about like what
4800620	4809980	that's all gonna look like or whatever they just say ooh extra items hmm interesting so yeah and
4809980	4814780	there's actually a whole little teaser thing that says The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt complete edition
4814780	4820740	extra items inspired by the Netflix series with a little Netflix logo there so and then I think
4820740	4827300	they also dated season two of the Netflix series for this fall at some point right sorry I didn't
4827300	4830780	catch a specific date I'm sure somebody will shout it out in chat because they didn't really
4830780	4836340	follow season one sorry it's on my to-do list so yeah there's lots of stuff and then they also have
4836340	4841940	an anime that's coming to do they really I miss that yeah boy Netflix loves their video game
4841940	4846900	anime don't they well again I guess witchers technically books but we know we know the video
4846900	4855340	games helped that's for sure yeah I just wish the ingress anime was good yeah true you know I
4855420	4860100	skipped an ingress event today to be here with y'all on the show just because it would have
4860100	4866100	been appreciate your sacrifice yes thank you yes there was a thing in the Bay Area and I really
4866100	4871980	wanted to go to get my badge tick but I didn't because I didn't want to miss the show actually
4871980	4878500	I probably could have made the show but I didn't want to deal with the traffic to be honest so all
4878500	4885060	right um DJ Rama S and chat says Rob speaking of anime did you watch Sanrio boys yet no I need to
4885300	4891540	I need to I've seen y'all have sent me the pictures and everything I need to see it that's for sure
4891540	4899700	and my deft Oh interesting also brings this up my deft brings up go that Pokemon go fest is next
4899700	4907180	weekend and yeah that's a pretty big deal too I will be here for olr because thankfully they did
4907220	4917620	that Sunday is just the raids and I'm less like needy on those as I am the Saturday stuff where
4917620	4922060	they actually have all the different Pokemon and the collection challenges and all that they kind
4922060	4927260	of made Sunday really a footnote but we're actually gonna drive into San Francisco on
4927260	4934300	Saturday to play there because it'll only be like 60 some odd degrees in San Francisco on Saturday
4934300	4939860	where it's here it's gonna be like in the 90s again so yeah so go fast to Saturday I'll be
4939860	4945620	doing that but Sunday I'll be back in time for olr cuz I'm not gonna raid all day long so all right
4945620	4955740	let's move on Dara Sagra sure so well hackers gonna hack people are gonna try to make profit
4955740	4963260	off of whatever they can this a 27 year old guy in Japan was arrested after he was caught trying
4963260	4974780	to sell modified Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild save files he was advertising them as quote
4974780	4981700	describing it as the strongest software and provide modded save files that would give players
4981700	4989780	different improved abilities and difficult to obtain items the whatever the customer would
4989780	4998820	request he was requesting 3500 yen about 31 bucks for this service and so it was spotted by the
4998820	5005940	Niigata prefecture police and they arrested him on July 8th for violating the unfair competition
5005940	5012660	prevention law and after he was arrested he admitted to selling more modded saves and
5012660	5020460	software's in the past and that he had sold about 10 million yen about $90,000 in the last year and
5020460	5027220	a half and well the judicial system in Japan is quite a bit different than it is here it's usually
5027220	5036540	you're accused you're guilty that's how it works so like with very few exceptions so I don't know
5036540	5039660	what's gonna happen with this guy he's gonna have to pay a lot of fines if he's actually gonna go
5039660	5049100	to jail or what have you but hey don't don't do it don't sell modded files it's really not a new
5049100	5061140	thing anyway I mean people have modified a video game software for ages there's more Nintendo
5061140	5071100	actually used that law to sue a go-kart company in 2017 and a different man in Japan was arrested
5071100	5084340	for selling cheats for Alliance of valiant arms an online shooter the the deputy director his name is
5084340	5089940	Ozakawa he's of the cybercrime countermeasures division of the Niigata prefectural police he
5089940	5099060	asked folks not to create sell or buy modified save data or software it's I mean here you
5099060	5104340	wouldn't get a smackdown for it there it's a pretty big deal and like I said the judicial
5104340	5112380	system is pretty tough yeah it is very interesting how that's something that is so frowned on there
5112380	5118140	but here I don't I mean I don't know a lot of people that kind of like buy save files as it
5118140	5122980	is I don't know if there's a huge market for that here I mean it's the internet whatever but yeah
5122980	5128780	it's interesting how I mean it would have to be dealt with more of it in a civil manner here where
5128780	5134380	Nintendo would take somebody to court for selling like modified versions or whatever like if that
5134380	5138540	if that were something they were gonna even chase which they I don't think they really do unless
5138540	5146620	they tack it on to something else so yeah and did your own ass and chat brings up oh yeah Mari
5146620	5150780	car we talked about that on anime jam session shout out Tuesday nights yeah that's a little
5150780	5156100	different though that's more of like you know stealing your intellectual property versus like
5156100	5161100	I modified a game save I mean I guess I guess it's my intellectual property because it's a
5161100	5169100	game safe but like yeah that's like it's the same law ridiculous same law though yeah so so if I if
5169100	5173380	if just if I accuse them then they're guilty right so then I'm just gonna accuse them of
5173380	5182700	perpetuating joy-con drift then where's my billions of dollars you'd really need to look
5182700	5188100	there's actually a really good documentary about prisons in Japan that talks a lot about the
5188100	5192500	prosecution that if something actually goes to a prosecution you're pretty much gonna get put away
5192500	5202020	hmm all right well let's move on to something that may end up in a court somewhere Loki
5202020	5210060	yeah so this is interesting there's a brand new set of like cheap programs or software or
5210060	5215020	something like that that this cheat maker is basically saying is undetectable on consoles
5215020	5221620	and PC the reason it's undetectable it's at least that's what they're alleging is because
5221620	5229980	it actually involves like a separate PC so basically taking video from your console or
5229980	5237580	your PC and then kind of running that through a separate PC with this program that then I guess
5237580	5245780	adjust I don't know if it's I would assume it's connected to your input somehow but it allows
5245780	5254060	they basically to do all the aim botting and stuff like that via AI and machine learning and stuff
5254060	5264060	like that so interesting of course the game that they're promoting with this right now is Call of
5264060	5272060	Duty and you know Activision is not having that so they actually were advertising this on YouTube
5272060	5279780	and they've taken the ad down now it's been struck with a copyright claim by Activision Publishing
5279780	5288140	so yeah I can only imagine this is gonna end well but it is they're building better cheat software
5288140	5293900	you know they're getting around stuff like that it stuff like that is gonna be harder to detect
5293900	5301260	especially when it's not directly modifying the console it's basically like an in-between the
5301260	5312060	console and you know the player so good luck yeah but it's like I can I give the YouTube and
5312060	5317860	copyright strike stuff a lot of shit because it's it's way overused and it never is seems to be on
5317860	5322860	the side of the creators but I'll give them this one like that's a pretty clever way to get the
5322860	5327940	ad down for you know your game which you know again if you're gonna use these aim bot things
5328740	5332140	and you're using if you're using them in multiplayer environments like Call of Duty
5332140	5338380	I'm sorry you're the bad person here not Activision not YouTube you're the bad person here if you're
5338380	5342580	using them in single-player mode go off I don't give a fuck do whatever you want to do in
5342580	5347860	single-player mode it's when you use this stuff to intentionally try to grief other people or get a
5347860	5353700	leg up on something that to feel like you're good at something when you're not and you're just
5353700	5357740	cheating and everybody knows you're cheating and the more you get up the ladder the more that
5357740	5363460	that shit always comes out at the end of the day always comes out at the end of the day yes it
5363460	5368900	especially when you see like you know streamers and stuff like that getting caught with some of
5368900	5376100	this stuff it's it's ridiculous but yeah I don't I don't get the point of cheating to make it way
5376100	5380980	up a ladder to brag about how good you are the game because you you're not suck at the game you
5380980	5386980	suck at it you're quite bad yeah I think these people they just can't really they don't really
5386980	5392780	care they just know I know but but I beat you so you're just mad you know like yeah cry more
5392780	5400260	cry more nerd yeah that whole thing exactly yeah it's it's silly yeah I mean you know there's
5400260	5405540	people in you know the online game obviously dark soccer and I both I'm in both play wait
5405860	5411740	way too much of his dead by daylight and I see hackers in that game once in a great while but
5411740	5417540	I don't I don't give them the kindness of a reaction I give them a swift right-click block
5417540	5424420	I don't want to see this bitch again that's what that's it for me so all right yeah Alan had a
5424420	5432100	match yesterday where there were seven people in the match somehow yeah okay so I've seen videos
5432100	5439500	of like there was there was a thing going on for a little while where people were getting two
5439500	5449780	killers that's wild is this was I think a couple of releases ago but I was in fact as I think I was
5449780	5458660	seeing this on like a polyester video hmm where they were trying to figure out which killer had
5458700	5465740	the act of terror radius because only one of them did but both were affected by survivor actions
5465740	5470020	it was really crazy but this is actually a glitch but I think that there's something in there that
5470020	5476900	people have been exploiting yeah and I want no part of that like again if you're just gonna cheat
5476900	5484980	at a game like congrats you did nothing like you just you just wasted everybody's time congratulations
5484980	5490780	including yours yeah all right all right let's move on while dark soccer continues to give us
5490780	5496060	kiddie shots let's move on and talk about one more story here before we get into our classic of the
5496060	5500820	week will you can see there on the side that maybe we're doing something special tonight but we'll
5500820	5507660	get into that in a minute first we'll talk about Atari why not let's talk about who how many out
5507660	5515900	there got your Atari VCS no exactly but anyway that you see I've already got a PC so I didn't
5515900	5520900	buy one well guess what Atari is gonna be getting even more into PC stuff because Atari is said that
5520900	5525340	they are going to be getting away from mobile gaming a little bit this is a recent report from
5525340	5532540	games industry dot biz a statement by the new CEO Wade Rosen of Atari says quote our intent with give
5532540	5537620	with any gaming experiences to provide accessible and joyful moments of meaningful play that's
5537620	5542380	the core of Atari and what binds our history with our future to that end we feel that premium
5542380	5548220	gaming is better representative of this type of gaming experience and the Atari DNA so they're
5548220	5553100	going to be reducing the free-to-play mobile gaming stuff and concentrate instant on premium
5553100	5559540	PC and console gaming of course I we get like a new IP Atari I mean because like honestly they've
5559540	5565380	just been re-releasing their old stuff I'll take to death I'll take new games out of the old stuff
5565380	5573480	if they're good like right well I take a castle crystal castles like remade hell yeah but it
5573480	5579180	better be awesome you know there be ray-traced crystal castles I want to shine in those crystals
5579180	5584100	hell yeah exactly see that would be fun crystal castles I bet would make kind of an awesome
5584100	5592060	platformer type of game but what do I know anyway I guess there's let's see they're gonna sell or
5592060	5597860	shut down some of their mobile IPs including roller coaster tycoon stories crystal castles
5597860	5604500	I guess is on mobile I didn't even know that Atari combat tank theory and ninja golf didn't know that
5604500	5608420	wasn't it I guess that's one of those new IPs you can look forward to from Atari I don't think
5608420	5615940	no it is like the game was very good ninja golf was on this the 70 70 800 oh wow okay it was a
5615940	5621220	joke gone bad all right I didn't know it even dated back there Wow all right no word on the
5621220	5627660	Atari hotel though I'm still waiting on that one there is that by the way since we brought up Atari
5627660	5635700	y'all want to bring up in television sure it's been an interesting thing here's the thing so
5635700	5643180	they've had an interesting week on Twitter because Tommy's Tommy likes to talk and he'll of course
5643220	5650260	talk about top CEO of in television and now in the amico and all that stuff and he's he's kind of
5650260	5656620	he's cooked himself a little bit on Twitter by engaging in conversations he probably shouldn't
5656620	5661780	be having and he kind of knows this so look I'm gonna I'm gonna make this long story short not
5661780	5666740	that I think that Tommy listens to this show but I also kind of believe if you say his name three
5666740	5672420	times in the mirror he does have a tendency to show up to defend the amico so I will I will try
5672460	5677380	to risk here and here's my honest-to-god advice with Tommy and I'm not this isn't to like knock
5677380	5682340	him or anything we've had him on this show before I think he's a fascinating interviewer I think he
5682340	5687820	really are a fascinating interviewee I think he really believes in the product I I still I'm I
5687820	5694380	pre-ordered that amico I'm interested in it I'm curious what it's gonna do my honest advice though
5694380	5701460	in television needs to have some more spokespeople and not just one because when you put everything
5701500	5707900	in the hands of one person that's when things can make or break for everybody if you know what
5707900	5713460	I mean right look at a company like Nintendo Nintendo didn't just have Reggie Fils-Aime
5713460	5719700	or intent Nintendo had Satoru Iwata rest in peace by the way I believe today is the anniversary of
5719700	5728780	his passing if I'm not mistaken Nintendo had Miyamoto Nintendo had other vote now they have
5728780	5734860	Doug Bowser of course Nintendo has Nintendo also has Sakurai you know and I you know and all that
5734860	5740300	and the memes the great memes of please do not ask me for this again a good gaming company has
5740300	5745860	lots of different spokespeople to promote the product and I think this is something in television
5745860	5751980	if the events of the past week and everything I think really shows they really need that and if
5751980	5758380	Tommy's not willing to have that I think that's and here's the thing I'm sure the response would
5758380	5764060	be something like but but but we have these developers over here we have this over and this
5764060	5771580	goes back to one of our big golden rules here at OLR and that is the truth doesn't matter it's
5771580	5776460	what's perceived that matters and there's only one person out there doing interviews on Amico
5776460	5784700	right now as far as we can all see so my strong advice get some other people out there to really
5784700	5792700	show that this system is for more than one person all right anyhow let's Oh see dark to see you says
5792700	5796700	I do love the ideas he was bringing to the table yeah I'm not knocking the system or anything like
5796700	5803580	ice I and I do think when he argues you should try it before you knock it I think that is a fair
5803580	5810980	request 100% and I I completely agree there's probably a lot of youtubers out there who want
5810980	5816260	to see this thing fail who have no intention of ever trying it or giving it a chance which again
5816260	5825500	hurts developers at the end of the day so again that's why my my suggestion is show more of those
5825500	5831900	people show some of these other people contributing to this system success and I think maybe you'll
5831900	5836860	get a different result a little bit there but dark to see it does agree everything that I'm
5836860	5842460	saying tire con chat says in television needs a PR agent unfortunately they probably have one but
5842460	5845660	it's also one of those things where it's like sometimes you hire the person that lets you do
5845660	5855980	whatever you want hmm right yeah like such as I'm sorry I'm sorry to bring this individual up but
5855980	5861020	such as our former president you know he only hired people and surrounded that we're gonna
5861020	5869340	agree to everything you wanted anyway well until they absolutely couldn't yeah and until finally
5869340	5875580	you know it was all taken away but anyway let's move on let's let's move on to another let's let's
5875580	5879980	look back on fonder times let's go way way way back and look on some fonder times in our next
5879980	5897380	segment and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull
5897380	5909020	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of something special it is a lot
5909020	5916860	more special and it is indeed a very special game we're doing a flag which is the fucking weird
5916860	5925460	arcade game and this one and I'm actually encompassing two together they're ones at sequel
5925460	5935660	but the game is called Sonic blast man and then the sequel Sonic blast heroes and I'm bringing up
5935700	5945580	specifically the arcade version because the arcade version is the weird one so basically you have a
5945580	5956460	setup where it's you've got this target in front of you that you punch and you punch it at certain
5956460	5962740	intervals in the game imagine like a reverse punch mania I guess for people who have actually played
5962780	5976540	a punch mania so it's you basically are playing a superhero and you have different well different
5976540	5983580	rescues that you have to perform and so you have to basically hit the enemies and different targets
5983580	5991260	and you in each target has a number of tons of resistance and so once you've depleted that ton
5991260	5998220	of resistance they'll be defeated so you have a pair of gloves and this mechanical punch pad so
5998220	6004100	you have to wear the gloves and punch strongly enough to deal the damage only three hits are
6004100	6013340	allowed so you have five stages and then they're like mostly typical rescuing of people scenarios
6013340	6022100	you have a woman who is being assaulted by a thug you have a baby carriage pushed into the middle of
6022100	6029900	the freeway by accident and that a truck will run over an armed group that takes control of the
6029900	6034860	building and is now the center of operations you have a giant crab terrorizing a cruise ship and
6034860	6042420	an asteroid that's set to crash into the earth now an interesting thing about this and if you're
6042420	6055820	watching the the video this is a words this one is a sonic blast heroes that we're watching but
6055820	6063140	it the in 1995 the original was recalled because of players who sustained injuries by playing the
6063140	6069420	game and then the Consumer Product Safety Commission said that Taito had to pay a fine
6069420	6076300	a fifty thousand US dollars for failing to disclose the injuries and of course what we're
6076300	6086740	seeing here is that we are looking at now the the the official sequel sonic blast heroes with
6086740	6091740	new touched-up graphics and you know that's basically still the same the same kind of game
6091740	6102660	so it did get a console release and who knows maybe this will get its own classic game segment
6102660	6112060	but it came out on the SNES as a beat-em-up and in this one you have to save earth from different
6112060	6118460	kinds of forces like street gangs and terrorists and aliens and robots and evil clone called heavy
6118500	6129020	blast man and it's a one player only I mean it's a beat-em-up there are also bonus levels that are
6129020	6136620	adaptations of the arcade version so since there's no like punch pad for strength you have to repeat
6136620	6147020	repeatedly rotate the d-pad it was it was definitely censored for the u.s. in Japan you
6147020	6156300	had female enemies in the u.s. you did not and it actually had a sequel as well on SNES sonic
6156300	6164540	blast man to you with different player characters that you had so actually there is the actual
6164540	6171420	sequel to sonic blast man is called it's more like a spiritual sequel called real puncher very
6171420	6177660	similar to the original game that has like a photo mode for the places for the faces of people in
6177660	6186460	each of the levels and it was released outside the side of Japan as a ticket redemption game so so
6186460	6192100	yes and then there's the other sequel so yeah there were more than one sequel so sonic blast
6192100	6201700	heroes was announced in 2010 in February and it hit the arcades around the same time and outside
6201700	6211340	of Japan it was called real puncher 2 and that's it weird-ass game they should make a one punch
6211340	6220620	band spin off of this game they should I mean it would fit since but for him you could only get one
6220620	6227020	punch you've got timing yeah I I apologize as I ran away to the restroom while you're talking
6227020	6232100	about this game but if you have you actually played this game out of curiosity this one yeah
6232100	6243940	yes nice what I feel like I've seen it and it hurt my wrist oh no all right all right well there
6243940	6250380	it is your plan oh go ahead and to answer gg around my ass and I don't know if he sent this
6250380	6255740	comment before I read that it was um wasn't sonic blast man one of the first games for super
6255740	6263460	Nintendo and yeah and that's the one I was talking about it was pretty early for the system it wasn't
6263460	6266980	one of my favorites to play out of the end of the beat em up so I was more of a final fight person
6266980	6274820	but it wasn't bad and I was glad that they could at the time that I played it I didn't know that it
6274820	6284340	was an arcade game I got to play one at it was at some little indie arcade that happened to have
6284340	6290900	one and then like I hurt myself after I played it and I decided not to play it again the end
6290900	6298340	all right we'll keep those flags coming that was a fun one so yeah there it is your classic flag
6298340	6306500	of the month all right a pair a pair a matching pair this this month all right let's get in excuse
6306500	6312940	me hiccups let's get into our rapid-fire news segment here I have some coffee brewing so I'm
6312940	6319340	gonna go grab that so let's get right to Loki and some rapid-fire news so Pokemon go is making lots
6319380	6326340	of money they've ranked are rigged in so far five billion dollars since launch so I'd say the game
6326340	6332020	successful I guess or maybe it's dead you know Pokemon goes dead that's what really we should be
6332020	6340500	taken away from this and then there was a new world or a couple of world records set for a
6341060	6351540	collection of old retro I guess LCD games so Linda Gilroy's she's got two different records
6351540	6360020	for one for having a collection of almost 1600 LCD gaming systems which is pretty awesome and
6360020	6366740	then also two thousand four hundred and thirty playable gaming systems so I'm assuming consoles
6366740	6376700	outside of that she's uh she's got more than love than Jamie's vault there so no I don't know
6376700	6387820	where's your world record for that but yeah so it's pretty cool to see the collection that she
6387820	6392860	has they have a video on YouTube about it and stuff so definitely worth checking out but yeah
6393580	6399660	those LCD games are pretty awesome group on that stuff so yeah I remember playing a I used to have
6399660	6406340	a Castlevania to Simon's Quest LCD game not as old as some of the like relaxing and stuff that
6406340	6413980	they're showing but fun stuff I used to love those LCD games I don't think I owned a lot of them
6413980	6418940	myself but I love those games and that's an impressive I didn't even know they made that
6418980	6423260	many of them so very impressive collection we just have to collect all those little mini
6423260	6427740	cabs now they can get a world record for that yeah I'm sure somebody's got me beat there
6427740	6433140	because there's too many of them now like somebody sent me a little um like it's like the tiny arcade
6433140	6437540	and it was like I was Hello Kitty pac-man or something like that and as neat as it looked
6437540	6441700	those really really tiny ones that are almost like keychain size they're not my favorite but
6441700	6448740	I guess when you're collecting things you still want them all you know so you know so because I
6449020	6454620	have a few of them so but yeah I didn't I didn't want to go seek out one of these Hello Kitty ones
6454620	6458980	but I like like the one that Alan got me a few weeks ago live on the show you know they're they're
6458980	6467100	pretty impressive now yeah the Galaga tabletop arcade went up oh really I don't know you guys
6467100	6472700	got yeah I think we got it like way dirt cheap you probably when when Loki was on here going
6472700	6476780	there 50 bucks at Walmart right now you probably jumped on one of those yeah I think Dan got it
6476780	6483940	somewhere else but but yeah it was it's pretty cool that's awesome yeah I'm hoping I'll have
6483940	6490580	some more space soon to expand those a little bit but I'll talk about that later all right let's
6490580	6494940	move on and travel around the world and check out some really oh I'm sorry we've been I'm sorry no
6494940	6503900	we need to do dark soccer's rapid-fire news then we do really dark soccer yeah that's okay um so
6503900	6513340	there is these pictures have been posted of an Animal Crossing monopoly and I mean it looks
6513340	6522700	pretty legit I mean it's got all the right stuff on the boxes it said that it was I mean some people
6522700	6530940	are saying that it's a rumor but I mean apparently Hasbro released one but Nintendo Hasbro or
6530940	6538340	Nintendo hasn't said anything about it yet there is a list for the game on Zato games UK website
6538340	6545380	for it but the reddit user that talked about it posted some pictures of the game and so we have
6545380	6553140	like Isabel inside the box welcome to your deserted island getaway and it has the cards
6553140	6558980	has a little punch outs for bells and coins and fruit and fossils you have four little figures
6559020	6567300	which there's only one girl and she's wearing pink which is terrible but the box looks really
6567300	6577060	cute the the back of it looks really cute I mean it seems fairly likely so I guess that you're
6577060	6587100	using your your fossils and whatnot little tokens instead of houses and whatnot so oh yeah probably
6587340	6595340	yeah SSG 100 Matt suggests is mr. Resetti jail you know I didn't look hold on because I'm gonna
6595340	6600580	look at the I'm looking at the play field no they know they he's not on there they cheaped
6600580	6607020	out by having just the traditional go-to-jail thing but it really should have been poor
6607020	6613060	Resetti yeah he really got a raw deal in this latest he's traumatized an entire series of
6613060	6622180	childhoods you know yeah and I love him for it mm-hmm so the other story here there you know we
6622180	6626780	we've every so often brought up different unopened games we have an unopened Legend
6626780	6634460	of Zelda from 1997 and it does look like it's a gold cartridge sold for 87 hunt no sorry for
6634460	6643460	eight hundred seventy thousand dollars and of course heritage auctions in Dallas put the is
6643460	6651540	what hosted the sale and the same auction house is the same one that sold the unopened copy of
6651540	6661740	Super Mario Brothers that someone forgotten his desk drawer since 1986 but yeah I mean if you
6661780	6666140	maybe I should never have removed the shrink shrink wrap from my copy of guitar ooh man
6666140	6678980	maybe we should sell an NFT of episode one let's do it well so we'll sell just enough so that we
6678980	6683820	can get pizza that's probably that's probably how much it would ultimately go for would just
6683820	6690500	buy a pizza maybe two we should hey if someone buys us a pizza we'll give you the first episode
6690500	6699940	no no no no I'm kidding I do not send you do not we'll send you a screenshot from the old webcam
6699940	6709540	you are not Homer Simpson and you are not selling the show for a forbidden donut I'm joking I mean
6709540	6720460	like just like an audio clip I'm like audio clips that would be NFT worthy but I forbid those from
6720980	6726980	ever happening did your MS says you can actually do that it's called treat stream no we're not
6726980	6731900	we're not getting any NFT business I don't until until it makes sense to me we're not getting into
6731900	6743860	that you want to really impress us get people to listen to the show I'll sell a pair of my
6743860	6749940	socks for like a good pizza I'm so excited for conventions to come back so I can actually like
6749940	6754980	tell people about this show again that'd be very nice we can maybe get some more listeners well
6754980	6765060	um next year though I mean I'm planning a derpy con and and dragon con although I really want to
6765060	6771140	do twitch con now oh yeah twitch con would be a lot oh my god twitch con would be off the hook I
6771140	6776300	really now I really want to do that yeah yeah I doubt it's gonna happen this year because that
6776300	6781900	would be a little soon because yeah that usually that was in like October November I think and I
6781900	6787220	think we would have heard by now if they plan on doing that but yeah 2022 for sure that'd be great
6787220	6793820	and I know some local cons are starting back up like there's gonna be a I think there's a sinister
6793820	6799940	con out in Roseville in August and I'll probably just show up say hey I don't think I'm doing it
6800180	6808020	official capacity there but November 14th is glitch con oh where's that at it's online okay
6808020	6817900	yeah nice let's see pod culture says trying to suss out how to get that click out which I think
6817900	6822540	is actually a response to editing a particular past episode of our show but I think it's a good
6822540	6827180	we're trying to suss out and get the click out that is exactly what we're trying to do for OLR
6827180	6836660	as well so I read it anyway there it is Carlos spanak topia a spin spin a copita sorry I'm
6836660	6842740	totally butchering that says DC one is weekend of anakopita spanakopita Carlos spanakopita

7200860	7206100	attention this week but we'll see all right let's move on we have some more stories for you and then
7206100	7210180	we'll get to your feedback in the listener roundtable I don't know if we have emails
7210180	7214900	tonight though I haven't checked there I haven't looked actually all right we'll find out meanwhile
7214900	7223100	Loki though there is a rumor that the PlayStation Vita store is going to be I don't know if it's
7223100	7229700	closed down or at least not releasing new games after July 20th this is coming from the developer
7229700	7238020	of a game called Russian subway dogs who is basically porting his game from PC to the Vita
7238020	7244940	but basically the developer Miguel Cerber has been rushing to finish it because he had heard
7244940	7253380	a rumor said it's gonna be switched off in 2021 but basically saying that you know right now it's
7253380	7260380	kind of a passion project of his to get it translated but yeah I don't know where the
7260380	7267740	July 20th date necessarily gets mentioned here but I do know that at least he's trying to rush
7267740	7272820	to get it done but that's the rumor date for right now so we'll have to see what happens with that
7272820	7278540	you know wasn't this the whole wasn't this the whole thing like about a year ago that Sony was
7278540	7283380	threatening to close down this store in the PlayStation 3 store and people really were up
7283380	7289460	in arms about it because there wouldn't be a way to play a lot of those classics if the store goes
7289460	7294580	down there's still a lot on PlayStation 3 you can't get anywhere else so it's interesting that
7294700	7301700	this is coming back now yeah I'm still trying to like the developer doesn't necessarily mention
7301700	7310300	the July 20th date so I'm just trying to figure out where they get that from so I don't know but
7310300	7319260	we'll see we'll see what happens it's not that long from now all right well a game I never shut
7319260	7323700	up about here on OLR is Final Fantasy 14 and I never shut up about it because I really enjoy it
7323700	7328700	I don't know if I enjoy it this much but I bet other people do to the extent that they would buy
7328700	7335140	a cookbook based on Final Fantasy 14 it's interesting the cookbook is for 14 and not 15 15
7335140	7341860	yeah exactly but to be I kind of think there already is one for 15 to be honest what so there
7341860	7348620	is that going on so yeah a Final Fantasy 14 cookbook was spotted and I guess it was named
7348660	7353780	something a little bit more generic but some digging from good old warrior of 64 on Twitter
7353780	7359700	found out that this book is slated to launch on November 9th 2021 it has a forward written by
7359700	7365500	Naoki Ishida and it's gonna cost about $35 of course we don't know what recipes if popoto soup
7365500	7371780	or whatever are going to be in there but I guess stay tuned for all the details on that sometimes
7371780	7376300	these things come with like a special code for an in-game item as well and that'll make it more
7376340	7380980	desirable this was also a reminder to myself to bring up the benchmark that just came out over
7380980	7384580	the weekend for Endwalker but I already talked about that earlier in the show so I guess I don't
7384580	7389780	need to say that again but dark soccer this might be something that interests you maybe maybe I mean
7389780	7396980	I like I like video game cookbooks a whole lot so it is a it is a fun little niche right like it's
7396980	7403500	like not something you see a lot but it's kind of funny when it's there so no one special 77 in
7403500	7410180	chat says if it isn't in the cookbook there should be a recipe for KFC Kentucky fried chocobo not
7410180	7415220	funny anyway fifth dream says who wrote the cookbook I was helping the author of the Wow
7415220	7422340	cookbook the GOT cookbook gather recipes from 14 and 15 but nothing came of it yet she wrote a
7422340	7427380	Star Wars cookbook too I don't have the name in front of me I'm sorry I cuz I don't know if I
7427380	7432140	think it's they're finding figuring this all out from the Amazon description for an untitled
7432140	7436580	project so I don't know if they actually know who the author of it is yet but that would be
7436580	7447180	really interesting if the same person so all right let's move on dark soccer so I'm saying
7447180	7453540	this with with the hope that we don't get into the big police discussion but it is going to touch
7453540	7461500	on it so I'm leaving a trigger warning for that right now so there the the New York Police
7461500	7467140	Department is rolling out this thing called a game truck they've already done it once but they want
7467140	7474940	us there there say their goal is to connect with youth particularly in low-income neighborhoods so
7474940	7484620	they said it's like a like an olive branch of sorts to sort of repair a relationship because
7484620	7493340	there's been so much deserved mistrust so the chief of community affairs for the department
7493340	7498580	has said and I'm just gonna read the the quote we're coming to your block we're coming out to
7498580	7503260	your neighborhood make sure our young people have a safe summer a safe place and know that
7503260	7511620	NYPD is here to support them so the truck has different gaming consoles including switches
7511620	7518060	ps5s Xbox Series X and they just want to connect to the young people that's what they said it's
7518060	7524260	painted with various Marvel characters and the word NYPD game truck I don't know what comic book
7524260	7527740	characters really have to do with video games apart from there being video games that contain
7527740	7532940	comic book characters but whatever you know that's when you let non gamers decide you know
7532940	7545820	do your marketing well it was free candy anyway they're they're saying that this is trying to
7545820	7551700	engage with the youth for extracurricular activities the first truck was spotted over
7551700	7558340	the July 4th weekend in the north end of Manhattan's East River Park near several of
7558340	7564500	the New York City Housing Authority buildings there's another truck in Bushwick neighborhood
7564500	7574220	it there now here's what the critics are saying is that there are people who want to think that
7574220	7580320	this is well-intentioned but it's another reflection and it's actually stated by
7580320	7589780	oleami olorian has a public defender with the Legal Aid Society not AIDS but Aid Society that
7589780	7596180	they try to intertwine themselves into the communities quote it's really it's really
7596180	7600420	just another means of indoctrinating people into believing the police are necessary and have to be
7600420	7605500	around and it's another way in which the same communities are forced to have constant police
7605500	7617860	presence end quote there's also some practices they like for example in 2018 they were questioning
7617860	7623540	a 12 year old boy suspected of committing a felony they gave him a soda from McDonald's the
7623540	7629700	interview was over the boy was let to go but they recovered the straw and entered his DNA into a
7629700	7637220	database it didn't link him to any crimes the family had to petition a court to have it removed
7637220	7643700	but I mean they're breaking laws so they're thinking that because of incidents like this
7643700	7656220	that they might be using these kids going into the the vans or whatever as a means to collect
7656220	7664620	DNA another quote by Marianne Kyshian who is a senior policy counsel with Brooklyn Defender
7664620	7671460	Services her quote says for decades the NYPD has aggressively sought to target and serve survey
7671460	7677620	New Yorkers particularly young black and brown people and to harvest and catalog their DNA in
7677620	7686300	the secretive internal archives such as the gang database and rogue DNA database it it may seem a
7686300	7694220	little bit what's what I'm thinking of almost conspiracy theory is except the fact that they
7694220	7702300	have done it before they're over survey survey doing over surveillance basically taking up some
7702300	7715380	predatory practices at least according to a lot of people NYPD didn't respond to any requests for
7715380	7725500	comments on this and none of the associated facilities have but there was I mean but it was
7725500	7732700	you know said by at the time the chief of detectives German Shay night in 2018 that there
7732700	7738980	is the NYPD criminal group database or quote gang database that was made up of 99% non-white people
7738980	7744140	particularly black and Latino young men with children as young as 13 years old being added
7744140	7754940	into it so there is definitely precedent for it however I'm going to go on the fence with this
7754940	7764660	one I think that it is a well intentioned plan you know and I think trust does need to be rebuilt
7764660	7772340	but I think they have to earn that trust you know they have to do more to earn the trust and I don't
7772340	7778940	think putting out a truck with video games to get some kids into play is gonna do it they need to be
7778940	7785020	massive overhauls yep I'm gonna I'm gonna just say agree and I'm gonna read some chat comments
7785020	7790060	that I think are pretty please please read Ron was our yeah our New York fam is lighting up on this
7790060	7795740	so yes of course I'll start with Rama so Rama says so let me say this since I live in NYC and
7795740	7801940	I'm a targeted person lol I think this is a good idea because the NYPD does have community
7801940	7806900	initiatives some are saying that this is a trap to suss out gang members I don't defend the NYPD
7806940	7813780	but I feel they're trying we just need better people in the NYPD to help with this I want to
7813780	7818700	read SHO 100 Matt's comment as well basically you got to go a long way to gaining trust in
7818700	7823980	communities gaming truck is nice and all but you got to have decades of trust to regain for some
7823980	7829060	folks and that's kinda that's kind of where my head is out with it is I and I think the the
7829060	7834380	well-intentioned part is is accurate it's one of those it's a especially when you paint Marvel
7834380	7838700	characters on the side of it and somebody in Chad had also said how do you do fellow kids with that
7838700	7845180	whole thing yeah there is a part of me that kind of like gold star you tried you get the you tried
7845180	7851780	start you it's well-intentioned you tried but it doesn't address the real issues it makes me think
7851780	7859300	of I'm gonna put it this way imagine you have a diabetic foot with neck necrotic tissue on it
7859300	7864700	now imagine just putting a band-aid and send me a spore and on it that's what this feels like to
7864700	7869060	me you might feel better for a little bit and that one little part might get a little bit better but
7869060	7874540	there's still a big festering necrotic wound underneath it that needs to well and when you
7874540	7881220	get to that point you need to cut some things out of it and replace things with good good tissue or
7881220	7887100	packaging or you know prosthetics at that point that's my thought about it is that it might not
7887100	7897860	be enough you've got to get and I know this is very broad and generalized you need to get the the
7897860	7903900	damaged tissue removed you need to remove the people who are going along with it who are
7903900	7910620	silencing others and are focusing on their own personal gain and personal power and we need to
7910620	7920140	bring back a police that is held accountable and also fairly holds itself accountable so that's my
7920140	7927300	two cents on it this is this is a very small this is a little bit of gauze and Neosporin where what
7927300	7936980	you need is like debridement and yeah um deejirama s in chat saying basically agreeing with what you
7936980	7941660	said but also wanting to say Marvel is popular and Marvel is in NYC so in a way it does make
7941660	7947500	sense that way all right I'll give you that bonds 006 was to chime in to saying also living here in
7947500	7952660	NYC Rama and I can speak volumes I have literally seen one of those gaming trucks six doors down
7952660	7960980	from my door right across a basketball court and slash school building interesting and Rama wanted
7960980	7965860	to add we'll get one more comment here from Rama and then we'll move on saying and I grew up in the
7965860	7970620	projects you know the bad part of town the parts of town where the cops are a lot which causes a
7970620	7976740	lot of these issues all I can say is that you have to live here to understand it so yeah but even if
7976740	7982140	you can you can listen to people as well and learn some stuff from the people that are there
7982140	7989580	and stuff that's why y'all's comments please bear in mind that Marvel is a lot more than just the
7989580	7996300	films where they're filmed has nothing to do with the comics all right just saying um let's go ahead
7996300	8002180	and move on to our next story because this is uh this is one of those things where I'm like wow
8002180	8007940	but also not surprised Loki I don't know how to set this up for you but it's all I have to say
8007940	8015900	is the word is de nouveau and so you know it makes sense that one we had a cracking group called
8015900	8021820	Empress remove the DRM including Dean nouveau from Resident Evil 8 they're doing the Lord's work
8021820	8029300	it not only allowed them to play it without DRM but also allowed them to play without the
8029300	8037220	stuttering issues that they've been having in the game since back in May and apparently like all the
8037220	8043260	game in-game stutters when you kill zombies or whatever been fixed because cap comes DRM entry
8043300	8048180	points have been patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore this results
8048180	8056980	in a much smoother gameplay experience like that that's a problem when your DRM causes performance
8056980	8062660	in game and the pirates are having a better game experience than your actual paid customers that's
8062660	8073100	how you that's how you get more pirates Capcom so maybe cut it out yeah this this whole thing speaks
8073100	8077620	volumes you know and I can't stop laughing at dark soccer saying they're doing the Lord's work
8077620	8083580	but in a way they are because it's one of those things where if the game runs better without it
8083580	8089620	it just encourages people to look into these types of things that perhaps they would have wouldn't
8089620	8095300	have looked into otherwise that's bad especially if Capcom can't lock that shit up now like now
8095300	8099860	then this story is just gonna spread and people are gonna see this headline oh how do I get
8099860	8108060	Resident Evil 8 to run better on my system oh I just steal it I see this is not a great situation
8108060	8114340	for Capcom and it's a really not great thing for due to ovo or whatever but people need to stop new
8114340	8122060	oh yeah new vote to get get out oh that's I it's it's terrible and I know we've never heard a good
8122060	8128180	story about it look I understand that companies want to protect their shit and I do not endorse
8128300	8136540	piracy here but when this types of stuff happens it is very embarrassing for all these companies
8136540	8142100	that it's like it's it's so obviously shines a spotlight on what the flaw is in the game when
8142100	8146300	it's impacting performance like that yeah and we're not seeing that people are pirating the
8146300	8152660	game necessarily with the cracked version you can crack a paid version as well and you know if your
8152660	8160620	consumer that wants to play the game you know not broken ethic ethically and ethically too yeah
8160620	8166620	yeah fifth dream in chat says I wonder how many other crappy ports of stuff was caused by the
8166620	8174460	copy protection well in this case it seems to be most of the blame is the Capcom DRM but didn't
8174460	8181620	have also sucks man how I sometimes miss the days I've turned to page 5 in the manual and type the
8181620	8188820	third word on the fourth line that would be defeated I guess that doesn't anymore these days
8188820	8194820	nope or the or the god what was it some of the Sierra games had the copy proof paper it was like
8194820	8198420	the dark red paper maybe was a Sierra I don't know but there's some company that had like the
8198420	8207940	I know dark red you couldn't copy it this is funny all right let's move on orange right in
8207940	8215900	chat says dial-a-pirate I love dial-a-pirate all right moving on let's talk about oh I think this
8215900	8220220	is actually last story we have tonight for our listener roundtable it's a story about robot
8220220	8227140	wrote not roadblocks but roblox they've just formed a deal with Sony to help with some of
8227140	8231780	the music issues now remember this was a thing that was starting to sneak up on on roblox was
8231780	8237540	how they were getting dragged off over all these copyright problems I'm sure it's snuck up on them
8237700	8243220	they weren't totally aware of all of the rampant piracy and copyright theft on their service maybe
8243220	8249780	okay the courts are sneaking up on them and the legal stuff is starting to okay so anyway now
8249780	8255220	they are on their way to get some music deals because of the 200 million dollar lawsuit over
8255220	8261540	copyright violations so roblox has unveiled a team-up with Sony music so this will allow the
8261540	8267300	label artists to be on the game platform the two will collaborate in innovative music experiences
8267300	8273060	apparently there's going to be a Lil Nas X concert in November can I just pause the show to
8273060	8281780	have a appreciation moment for Lil Nas X I realize I realize um what he's doing is is uh very um you
8281780	8286100	know it's it's causing some people to go that's a little much for television that's a little much
8286100	8295700	but you know what it is fucking fascinating to me fucking fascinating to me that when Lil Nas X
8295700	8300180	kisses a dude during a performance on the BET awards or whatever that was that happened was
8300180	8303780	certainly alive where that happened too I don't know but in his live performances where that is
8303780	8310980	happening they will show that clip and stop it right before that moment happens and then
8310980	8316980	immediately run the clip from the video music awards from like 15 years ago when Madonna kissed
8316980	8324260	Britney and Christina Aguilera but they don't censor that one what's the difference what's
8324340	8328740	the difference one makes the straight white males uncomfortable
8330740	8337460	does does Lil Nas X make you uncomfortable no I don't care I'm insane and and why not
8337460	8343460	I think he's super cute I and why does Lil Nas X not make you uncomfortable this is and this I'm
8343460	8348340	not interrogating you I I think you actually are a model you're a model heterosexual I want other
8348340	8355540	heterosexuals to hear this what why are you not bothered by Lil Nas X who cares who he's kissing
8355540	8363460	he's not kissing me I don't care that's a TV oh my god a lot what a logical conclusion Loki that
8363460	8369620	is very you're right you're right it doesn't affect you you're right it's amazing outstanding
8369620	8374980	it's like I seriously think like some of the like mindset people have about this like stupid people
8374980	8381060	let's be clear it's absolute stupid people it's just like oh my god if I watch this I'm gonna be
8381060	8387460	gay you know like it's it's stupid people I'm sorry and there's a lot of stupid people in this
8387460	8393380	country unfortunately and around the world yeah you want to know what makes you gay mass effect
8394980	8402980	kidding so look I just but I will say all that I I think Lil Nas X like the way he's responding
8402980	8408180	to his critics is on point and I wish there was somebody like him that I had when I was younger
8408180	8415220	because when I was younger all we had was Madonna and that's why Madonna is such a gay icon for
8415220	8423860	people around my age is because she was the person that was basically like I'm gonna you know do this
8423860	8429060	stuff and be unapologetic I'm gonna be unapologetically me whether you like it or not
8429780	8435780	mm-hmm so anyway sorry little bit I didn't mean for a Roblox story to get me on this tangent
8435780	8442420	but here we are it is a well are all right that's what we do that's true I'm gonna go on a tangent
8442420	8448180	so my kids or my my son's actually taking the class a coding class for Roblox this week which
8448180	8454260	is kind of fun these are excited about that but they've been knee deep in uh Brookhaven which is
8454260	8458420	a game on Roblox and tell me about all the lore and stuff that happens it's like some
8459460	8465700	roleplay game thing where you get to pretend to be like rich people or kids or I don't know
8465700	8471940	something hmm now I know who Lil Nas X is and that's who's doing the concert in Roblox in
8471940	8478180	November I do not know who Zara Larsson is can a young person explain this to me who is who's
8478180	8485620	Zari Larsson that is a they are getting a launch party in May whoever that is sorry um I'm getting
8486100	8490500	to that age y'all I need do we have some 20-somethings out there in the audience can
8490500	8496660	somebody explain to me who is that who should now I feel like I'm the Dionne Warwick talk show and
8496660	8502180	I'm inviting the guest on who are you and why should I care about you like what have you seen
8502180	8507460	that sketch of Saturday Night Live because that's like my favorite thing anyway uh oh see see the
8507460	8515300	chat is already lighting up I don't know who this is I'm sorry she's a Swedish pop icon oh no wonder
8515700	8518100	no wonder my comment just rubbed you the wrong way
8523780	8529700	let's see bonds 006 says Rob we need a younger audience to connect with uh I guess I just can't
8529700	8535540	listen to all of the music in the world like sorry especially pop music I'm not listening to any of
8535540	8541540	that but if it's Swedish I'll honestly if it's Swedish pop I will probably there's a larger
8541540	8546820	chance I'll probably like it like to be to be fair and you know what there was there was a date so
8546820	8551380	there Carlos there was a date and time when I didn't know who Carly Rae Jepsen was
8551940	8556260	but then I had it explained to me and I listened to some of the songs I was like oh
8556260	8561780	yes queen go off sis I guess all of that
8564260	8570260	so maybe I'll do this she won she won one of the Got Talent shows oh did she uh okay okay
8570900	8575220	all right um moving on let's see what else I want to see about the Roblox store this really wasn't
8575220	8583060	supposed to be old man yells at cloud but here we are he said it not me and I'm older uh they
8583860	8589380	you do but you're you're young you're young at heart and hip anyway um yes this is not yeah
8589380	8597540	along with my broken hip I'm uh this is not the first deal Roblox is made there was a deal with
8597540	8603300	bmg and warner as well uh so universal is the only big label that hasn't signed an agreement
8603300	8610100	yet so this could bode well for Roblox um why doesn't like youtube do something like this or
8610100	8620900	why doesn't twitch yeah I think that would be great there you go um Carlos says Rob you'll
8620900	8625860	like it I need to get you on the Nordic pop queens um I already listened to Robin what else do I need
8626740	8627220	really
8630500	8634500	I love Robin all right excuse me I'll keep dancing on my own and like it
8636340	8641300	actually and legit um before the pandemic actually it was probably about a year before the pandemic
8641300	8647380	I saw Robin live in Oakland on the tour for her latest album that is not Swedish that is legit
8647540	8654820	one of the who said she's Irish and it's not Swedish no bonds 006 is
8655620	8660820	listening like pop music I'm like uh no that's she's she's Irish
8663940	8668820	Carlos uh says I mean Robin was your era since she started glowing up in the 90s
8668820	8674420	was that shade was that do we need the shade button was that shade I don't think it was
8674420	8679620	intended shade it was more like a passing cloud I don't read it as such it's fine
8681780	8685940	it was a little bit of fog rolling in that's fine no one special 77 says
8685940	8692580	Roxette and ace of base yo now we're fucking talking now we're fucking talking Roxette
8692580	8699780	that was my era that oh and mine too there's plenty to go around share you know it was funny
8699780	8709060	those like Roxette and ace of base were my guilty pleasures because I was still like radio head
8709060	8716820	Pearl Jam you know Soundgarden all of the stuff that came out of the grunge revolution and then
8716820	8722820	I was also listening to Ace of Base I'm living proof you can have one foot in goth industrial
8722820	8728180	and you can have the other foot in DDR music okay I'm living proof there's nothing wrong with it
8730500	8740020	well and also like like mid-90s j-pop um Carlos and chat says if I recall correctly members of
8740020	8746420	Ace of Base are problematic now yeah some things happen one of them had a problematic past yeah
8746420	8752580	I'm trying to just uh remember what I remember in the 90s so that's uh that's how I look at that
8753460	8760180	um and then um well it's like I own some jeffree star makeup that I bought before I knew what a
8760180	8764660	piece of shit he was I'm not selling it because it was expensive I'm not throwing it away because
8764660	8769140	I paid money for it but I'm not gonna buy anymore I'm just gonna transition this to listener
8769140	8773780	roundtable because that's essentially what we're doing right now uh we have other comments in
8773780	8781540	chat bonds 006 says Soundgarden Radiohead P.O.D. Chevelle Rob Zombie Tattoo I stopped now that is
8781540	8790180	okay like like at least half of those I at least own one album by them for sure um let's see um
8793140	8799940	uh moving on uh shad star six in chat saying the new world ends with you has this goth synth pop
8799940	8804900	song and it's one of my favorites from the demo that okay but speaking of like goth and
8804900	8810660	synth pop coming together that's why I love echo image so much that's what that band is
8811220	8816420	echo a different drum was kind of a goth label like I guess I know a lot of synth pop it was
8816420	8821860	it would that blend was like that so I that's why they're one of my favorites
8824500	8831940	I mean and there is goth synthwave I mean the whole uh uh retro new wave movement which is
8831940	8838980	kind of like sort of my thing right now there's a lot of crossover into like the goth uh uh
8840980	8847780	I'd say uh what's the word I'm thinking of like the umbrella of goth yeah it branches out to so
8847780	8852260	many different things I mean because you have your old industrial I mean
8854660	8861380	it it's always been married absolutely that's what the cure is to me the cure is
8862820	8867460	I'm thinking really like they're not you're probably the synth pop I know you're talking
8867460	8872820	more like a epoxy berserk and things like that and um the other one okay so before we did olr
8873540	8877140	um I used to go to goth club all the time no I've told this story before that was my Sunday night
8877140	8882180	was goth nights at the rage which is doesn't even there anymore I went to the other one this is
8882180	8887860	funny but yeah in midtown but I remember the asylum was what they called it asylum always
8887860	8892340	closed out every night the lat one of the last songs they would play was wilsham once in a
8892340	8901540	lifetime that you remember that that's where my bachelorette party ended up oh yeah yeah yeah
8902980	8909140	at asylum uh-huh that was my bachelorette party yeah but there was um they got the
8909140	8915380	dj to play echo image right when yeah I remember that I think that was Jessica that did that too
8915380	8920420	got the dj to play echo image like and and um the guy actually liked it and put it in his rotation
8920420	8923780	for a couple months which I thought was yeah it just that was right around the time a ddr
8923780	8930500	ultra mix 2 came out so yeah it's awesome oh love that um let's see uh fifth dream says I
8930500	8936740	miss goth night but the pandemic puts so many goth nights on twitch um bonds 006 says no love
8936740	8942980	for grunge music no I just I didn't maybe follow it as much yeah no just say that I did yeah um
8943700	8949780	I don't I probably didn't listen to as much of it but you kind of you you listen to it I don't
8949780	8954340	know when I was growing up in the 90s I was doing a little bit of everything honestly you know you
8954340	8963380	go to my collection and you would see things like like pm dawn and radio head elanis uh just any
8963460	8968980	anything and everything anyhow um let's see
8971460	8977460	um by the way shane help us answer an earlier question in the show uh the oled switch somebody
8977460	8981620	asked if you like were gonna fight people to pre-order it and I was kind of like I think
8981620	8986500	shane is gonna get it but he had to kind of talk himself into it a little bit he wasn't like
8987620	8990020	oh my god I gotta get one right away after seeing the trailer
8990020	8998580	um fifth dream says stone temple pilots pj ten oh I thought you were gonna say pj harvey
8998580	9004340	now that was up my alley in the 90s so you know my other 90s group though that I was like way into
9004980	9011540	and still am um luscious jackson oh I love luscious jackson heck yeah well I mean like my
9011540	9018340	two like personal theme songs I'd say from them is uh lady fingers and daughters of the chaos
9018740	9026740	uh such a such a good group um fifth dream said nick cave fuck yes cave oh my god that
9026740	9033060	nick and the duet he did with kylie yes so actually oh legit though my favorite
9033060	9038660	nick cave song is the ship song which is like a slow bow I love that song anyway all right
9040180	9046660	you know you know who I always had like this mental impression of the most interesting duet
9046660	9053300	ever would have been leonard cohen and nick cave could you just imagine surprised that
9053300	9059220	ever happened yeah um okay now lady fingers does like my personal theme song just to tell
9059220	9064820	shad stars like that um and shane's in chat and wants to say I will be getting it the oled switch
9064820	9069060	yes I went back and forth because it's only a screen upgrade but then I realized I barely play
9069060	9072900	it docked so there was so okay so I didn't mischaracterize that there was a little back
9072900	9077380	and forth he didn't just say oh I'm getting it because it's new and shiny uh he had to
9077380	9083060	talk himself into it a little bit all right anyway uh moving on uh I was gonna get to our email I
9083060	9087540	don't think we have any tonight we don't have any let me shout let me shout it out anyway participate
9087540	9092260	at orange lounge radio.com but sadly there are no emails to read tonight but maybe we'll get some in
9092260	9098500	the future that means I get to have a quick drag race tangent because I'm watching all star six
9098500	9105060	I'm actually watching it I need to buy it is it any good um buy it oh oh yeah because you that's
9105060	9110420	right you download by episode I have paramount plus but um actually yes because give me your
9110420	9117060	login okay I will just remind me and I will um the thing I like about it is that it's not
9117620	9122100	like what I was really starting to get turned off with with drag race was it was just drama drama
9122100	9127140	drama drama manufactured drama and all star six is surprising considering this is a cast that has
9127140	9132020	eureka silky nutmeg ganache and some of the queens that are kind of known for that stuff
9132020	9138980	like honestly redemption is a very strong theme this season and people like silky nutmeg ganache
9138980	9142820	know exactly how they were received by the public and they are doing everything they can to change
9142820	9149540	it does she still draw her brows on with a sharpie um I just I just prefer to talk about the milk and
9149540	9156180	cookies in her titties but anyway that is okay that is uh that that's that's my quick tangent
9156180	9160180	on drag race is that I'm actually enjoying all star six and what's really surprised me is some
9160180	9164980	of the queens that are doing well were not the ones I was expecting to so it's very very
9164980	9170740	interesting yeah this is a very redemption based season so message me and I'll I'll do a little
9170740	9175940	marathon um yeah you you just you I'll call you later but you have to you have to because you're
9175940	9179140	going to probably stream after the show tonight so I'll probably do it tomorrow yeah but you have
9179140	9183220	to go and log in and then you get an activation code and then I put in the code that's how got
9183220	9188660	you yeah all right cool all right I'll uh I'll tell Dan we'll get that set up okay cool yeah I
9188660	9192820	don't care just watch whatever you want I just uh don't do it on Thursdays when they release them
9192820	9197780	because that's when I watch them but okay I think we're the only other person I'm sharing with is
9197780	9203140	only on it for Star Trek so I don't think that's a problem right now so I want to watch that too so
9203140	9210740	binge away have fun all right all right anyway uh let's move on um oh I there was a big old
9210740	9214820	question here from no one special I want to make sure I get that here no one special always tries
9214820	9219540	to come up with a good question for the listener round table and I think I skimmed it ah yes okay
9219540	9224260	so this is about video game movies uh no one special says as you all know video game movies
9224260	9228100	are nothing new and have been around for ages they run the gamut from terrible see the blood
9228100	9232980	rain movies well just honestly anything with ue bowl right uh to fairly good the silent hill
9232980	9237540	movies and have been in multiple genres documentaries fictional stories etc all that
9237540	9242820	being said is there any video game movie that stands out for you that you particularly enjoy
9242820	9247700	even if it may be an unpopular choice for me I especially love the first two final
9247700	9255300	fantasy movies and the king of arcades so video game movies you uh enjoyed even if the masses
9255300	9260020	didn't see I would I love silent hill that's what I'd say is silent hill the masses didn't
9260020	9265220	really like that movie I liked the first resident evil that really had nothing to do with it
9265220	9271780	yeah to me yeah um I am so jazzed see now now it's interesting because it's not just movies
9272580	9278500	now it's going to be tv shows because again we have the witcher which okay yeah book you know
9278500	9284900	whatever it's kind of on the line um but I could I even I wonder if I could answer this question
9284900	9290420	with something like because you said um Mortal Kombat the very first one well I was gonna say
9290420	9296180	what about something like stranger things I know that isn't rooted in gaming but I'll be damned if
9296180	9300900	that show doesn't feel like a video game plot and kind of tickle a lot of the same like retro stuff
9300900	9308580	that video games kind of do for me I don't know oh I also like to warcraft oh SSJ100 Matt says
9308580	9312660	Scott Pilgrim while not a gaming movie per se didn't get the props it should have at the box
9312660	9318980	office I'm gonna I had a lot of fun we did a um a cult hosting of that um right before the pandemic
9318980	9323860	no I mean it was about a year before um but we I remember hosting it in a double feature with
9323860	9330900	Kung Fury here locally and that was a lot of fun that showing was a ton of fun and to get to watch
9330900	9336020	Scott Pilgrim with other nerds and stuff that enjoy the movie that was a lot of fun Shane
9336020	9340500	actually went to that I guess that was a while ago because Shane was actually here so uh it must
9340500	9346020	have been several years ago I'm just losing track of time um but yeah that was uh that was a lot of
9346020	9351700	fun to host that one um there's also all of the Pokemon movies but those are a little bit more
9351700	9358820	related to the anime Carlos said Detective Pikachu though which I I think that's a good choice that
9358820	9363780	was a good movie I like that so yeah I feel like the gaming but now now we're going to be talking
9363780	9368900	about gaming tv shows too I can't wait for that Final Fantasy 14 show I'm gonna I'm gonna eat that
9368900	9373140	up whenever that comes out I mean I know that's been slowed down because the pandemic um you know
9373220	9377380	I did also kind of like House of the Dead but only kind of liked it it was more like I need
9377380	9383140	something completely mindless and violent to watch it's okay to like things in a cheesy kind of way
9383140	9391060	too yeah well I mean I love Xanadu so whatever um oh Bobby Blackwood legacy is not a video game
9391060	9396660	movie but but I get it I get it and I I think that is an answer that would qualify because
9397380	9402260	no it's not directly a video game movie but it did kind of spawn the video games like especially
9402260	9407380	the early the Tron from the 80s especially you know spawned the the actual arcade machine discs
9407380	9412500	of Tron and I think it was more about like arcade culture was definitely like a part of that so I
9412500	9418500	I would I would count Tron legacy um but Bobby Blackwolf I like this move answer too not a video
9418500	9422500	game movie but looks like a video game if someone asks me what's your favorite movie that most
9422500	9428180	people hate or never give a chance it's Speed Racer I feel like that's that game that movie
9428260	9433940	was great it's actually well it's also a game too but um yeah the movie was amazing that's
9433940	9440420	one of those movies I feel like time is being very kind too and like a lot of people like I
9440420	9445700	hear more about that movie now and people looking back on that fondly than I did when the movie came
9445700	9451700	out you know how like there's a lot of movies that end up aging pretty well and then people kind of
9451700	9456420	look back on it more fondly than when it was originally out it's definitely one of those so
9457380	9463860	love that all right um I think that's it for uh the the movie chat and the the round table stuff
9463860	9467780	let's check in to see if there's any last minute stories and then we'll close up shop tonight I'm
9467780	9471300	sorry I didn't go to discord tonight but we are running we're almost to nine o'clock so I want
9471300	9475380	to make sure we kind of wrap up here in the coming moments so let me go to the last minute stories
9475380	9479220	oh I will shout out the discord though because I do read it and I know I pulled some stories
9479220	9484500	for tonight from it so vog network.com discord I enjoy seeing the chatter and the story suggestions
9484500	9491060	throughout the week um Loki do you have any last minute stories not really I mean there's um a
9491060	9498340	rumor of a game was it a fighting game based off of Nicktoons that I think they've already had an
9498340	9504500	ios and android version of that's being ported to the switch in October so that's it all right
9505620	9510340	well then we will go around and get everybody's final thoughts um yeah tiger claws saying the
9510340	9516900	movie was directed by the directors of the the matrix um so uh yeah the Wachowskis uh and that is
9516900	9525380	uh are are they both doing the new matrix movie or just they are I think so I think it might be just
9525380	9531460	Lana that's doing the matrix I don't know but they're um but yeah um I'm I'm I'm gonna sound
9531460	9536180	like Loki here but I really want to see that new matrix movie me too it looks like it's gonna be
9536180	9543380	awesome they have now amazing yeah and plus I loved Sensei I need to actually I only got like
9543380	9547860	halfway through the second season I just was bad timing for me I need to go back and finish that
9547860	9553460	because that was uh that was an awesome show and that was the Wachowskis as well so awesome all
9553460	9559140	right and Bobby Blackwolf confirms it's just Lana so I I don't know but it's other projects or
9559140	9565940	something going on all right um anyhow let's wrap it up with final thoughts and then we will uh

9635140	9641220	some olr specific shirts um so uh and a pretty cool new vog network logo logo that's a very
9641220	9647540	retro inspired so dark soccer good job vog network.com slash shop if you want to go shopping
9647780	9652740	and check out some of the merch there um thank you thank you again a nice five-star review on
9652740	9657780	a site like itunes or wherever it is you found this podcast um spotify google play or whatever
9657780	9663700	um thank you thank you and uh you share uh auto hosts on uh twitch they go a long way as well so
9663700	9668500	thank you to everybody who helps us out with all of that um now I think I'll go to final thoughts
9668500	9672740	now that I said that that mandatory part that we always have to say um because it's fully good
9672740	9679460	information so dark soccer what is your final thought tonight um uh I'm gonna I might play
9679460	9687860	pyramid head for the first time so I need help um my advice is don't overdo the trail but remember
9687860	9694420	that trail will help you out like crazy in chases so chase where palette or uh use the trail where
9694420	9701060	pallets used to be use the uh trail by windows I do it little blips by the um places that because
9701060	9704980	then they act more if you leave a big old line survivors will see it and they'll duck under it
9704980	9708980	but if you leave little blips it'll function more like trapper traps and you're more likely to hit
9708980	9715140	people with it um and then the other but I found that that was that other move that's the projectile
9715140	9719460	kind of attack I found that goes through walls the laser yes laser beam I don't know the real name
9719460	9725940	laser beam is great but don't rely on it I in my opinion the laser here's where the laser beam is
9725940	9731220	going to be the best um if you know and you you've played enough killer now dark soccer you know
9731220	9736180	when a survivor is about to palette you right pretty much you will be shocked at how many
9736180	9741300	survivors forget the pyramid head has a laser beam so when you know you're about to get palleted
9741300	9745700	hold the right mouse button to start drawing your lines and as soon as they throw the palette down
9745700	9750580	do your laser and you'll hit them every single time that sounds delightful I might enjoy him
9750580	9755780	I enjoyed Freddie more than I thought I would Freddie's a lot of fun so yeah anyway all right
9755780	9761380	um so okay well have a did I get your final thought I don't oh that was my final thought
9761380	9765540	I'm gonna I might play pyramid head and I need help I could I didn't know if it was just another
9765540	9769700	tangent or a final thought I couldn't remember sorry all right have a great story and but I am
9769700	9774420	going to gracefully see myself out for now I will not be on cam tonight just because these bright
9774420	9778980	lights are giving me a fucking headache all right sorry for the migraine all right feel better
9779780	9783780	hey no I am I don't have a migraine I'm just like they're they're finally starting to get to my eyes
9783780	9788420	so that's okay all right uh all right so Loki we'll go to you and your final thought

9793860	9800500	build I'm doing is pretty large so look for that hopefully this week all right um my final thought

9850500	9853460	not a lot of the myths that are out there on the internet because the more people that get
9853460	9857220	vaccinated the less chance these other things are going to spread around and the more chance we can
