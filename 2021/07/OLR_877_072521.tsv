0	15000	It's a pivot point for gaming culture, with budding new upstarts hoping to carve out their slice of the gaming universe.
15000	23000	Peloton is pivoting to gamify exercise, Panic is opening up orders of their rich monochrome portable, and the march of new games, remasters and groundswell events continues.
23000	28000	Being a gamer is only getting better, and the definition of one continues to expand with more and more options.
29000	34000	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details on these and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34000	36000	Today and right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	43000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back.
43000	51000	Another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live here once again.
51000	58000	Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, The Voice of Geeks Network.
58000	64000	I am here, Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64000	65000	Hello.
65000	73000	Hello. Here with me for episode 877 for July the 25th of 2021 because I don't think I said the date and the episode number up front.
73000	77000	And that's important when you have 877 episodes. It's a lot to sift through.
77000	78000	Right.
78000	83000	It's a lot to browse. Did you know I was listening because we do tape live, of course, after the Bobby Blackwell show at VOG Network.
83000	89000	And Bobby, you can actually on his website, you can go back all the way to episode one and download everything.
89000	91000	You actually can't do that with us. Did you know that?
92000	93000	Yeah.
93000	94000	We're special.
94000	99000	Yeah, because it's just too much because we're three hour or well ish through three hours ish.
99000	104000	It's anywhere between two and three hours every week. So the file size really accumulated.
104000	107000	So I think you can get everything back to like episode 600.
107000	114000	But so it's it's still a good chunk, but you have to you have to look around and ask people to find anything earlier than that.
114000	118000	I don't know if listening to old news is always fun, though.
118000	122000	I don't know. Do you like to listen to old stuff with old news, DarkSakura?
122000	126000	Certain podcasts, but they're not news podcasts, I guess.
126000	130000	Yeah, that's the thing. That's the thing. We should we should have had an evergreen format.
130000	136000	We could have talked about different. I mean, I guess there are stuff there are things like the classic game of the week is kind of evergreen content.
136000	140000	There are pieces of the show. The bad jokes are always evergreen.
140000	150000	But, you know, the gaming news, I would think you got to go back to go back to episodes where, like, oh, Nintendo announced this week that they're naming their new console, the Wii.
150000	154000	What a dumb name. This console is going to flop with a stupid name like that.
155000	162000	Oops. I don't know if we were that big on it, but obviously it didn't that name didn't matter. That's for sure.
162000	167000	Well, I don't think I ever changed my story about the name. It was something that got people talking.
167000	170000	Yeah, it did get people talking. That's for sure.
170000	175000	Somebody else here on the show that likes to get people talking. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
175000	178000	There's lots of names of the kid made it that were even worse.
178000	182000	And they should have it. Wii U would have been worse, actually.
183000	185000	Wii U.
185000	190000	I'm sorry, but I can only think of Kung Pao when I hear Wii U. It's just, you know.
190000	196000	I know. That was not a great name. Yeah, I, you know, I'm the Nintendo leak stuff.
196000	200000	There was more this week, and I think a little bit of that's coming up later in the show.
200000	209000	But I think one thing that we didn't put in there was the list about the list of potential candidates for the, like, the names for Nintendo Wii came out.
209000	213000	There was, like, a big Excel document that was in there, but it was something like 100 names.
213000	219000	And so, in a way, I'm kind of like, I don't know if that's really news because, like, it's a brainstorming session.
219000	226000	And so you just saw all these other names. You don't know which ones were, like, the silver and bronze contenders.
226000	234000	But you can look at those names and you can go, you know, this is what they passed up and went with Wii.
234000	238000	But the Wii thing ended up working out for him, didn't it?
238000	240000	It was the Wii U that didn't work out for him.
240000	243000	But, like, is it the name that made it or the system that made it?
243000	249000	Like, if they called that the revolution instead and it still had the appeal, like, I don't think the name had that much to play with it.
249000	253000	Now, when we're talking about the Wii U, that just caused confusion.
253000	261000	I will say this. My direct response to your question, Loki, is did the name Wii sell it? No.
261000	263000	But what did sell it was Wii Tennis.
263000	268000	And so I will give Nintendo the benefit. I can't believe we're talking about this, how old it is.
268000	272000	But I guess it is relevant with the spreadsheet showing up this week.
272000	276000	But I will say this. Wii Tennis is the reason that system sold as much as it did.
276000	283000	And so at least that name, Wii Tennis, you know, that Wii, it almost, I think in Nintendo's eyes, it became a verb.
283000	287000	To Wii. But not the way y'all are thinking, grade schoolers.
288000	294000	I mean, like, you know, the Wii being the system and something like Wii Tennis is only playable on the Wii.
294000	302000	If it wasn't named the Wii, there may be some people locally that might be still alive today because of stupid radio hosts.
302000	306000	Ooh, ouch. Yeah. But that was a whole other issue.
306000	312000	Okay, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. This sucks. I have no other way to say it.
312000	316000	And so I'm just going to kick it over to DarkSagra to tell us about what's happening.
316000	338000	So there is a lawsuit that was introduced, sorry, filed on July 20th this month against Activision Blizzard for sexual harassment and other types of discrimination going on in the workplace.
338000	350000	It was stated that they, quote, have a pervasive frat boy workplace culture that have led multiple women to quit and may have contributed to a woman's suicide.
350000	363000	It is a 29-page Civil Rights and Equal Pay Act complaint that says that the place is a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination.
363000	380000	It ignores inappropriate work behavior and it regulates women to low-paying, low-ranking jobs with lower salaries than the men, which has, I mean, been a constant just in general with a lot of major companies.
380000	399000	There's also some of the harassment that has happened. They have what's called cube crawls, where the male employees drink a lot of alcohol and visit the cubes to harass the women along the way.
399000	404000	That men could come in hungover at work and play video games around the clock.
404000	411000	But if women went to take a quick walk during a break or leave to go pick up children from daycare, they were reprimanded.
411000	420000	Male workers were taking over lactation rooms to kick out nursing mothers so they could have meetings there.
420000	431000	And the men would openly talk about their sexual encounters, talk about female bodies and joke about rape, which is unforgivable.
432000	437000	Furthermore, they said that fewer women reached top roles at the company. This is a quote.
437000	444000	The women who do reach higher roles earn less salary, incentive pay and total compensation than their male peers.
444000	459000	Activision came out and said that the claims were, quote, distorted and in many cases false and that they were disappointed that the state regulators had not worked with Activision in good faith to investigate before the lawsuit.
459000	465000	Their quote says we value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone.
465000	471000	There is no place in our company or industry or any industry for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind.
471000	479000	We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims in cases related to misconduct. Action was taken to address the issue.
480000	500000	Anyway, there's also another note about this is where the the suicide thing comes in, is that there was a woman who
500000	508000	worked for Blizzard and killed herself on a business trip.
508000	515000	She had been with a male supervisor that she had been having an intimate relationship with.
515000	523000	And it also stated that the male coworkers were passing around photos of her naked before she took her life.
523000	529000	Activism is saying that her death was not relevant to the claim and were being nasty about it.
529000	540000	It's like we were sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case with no regard for a grieving family.
540000	541000	Bullshit.
541000	544000	Even though revenge porn was going around the workplace.
544000	547000	You've got to be that is fucking bold of Activision today.
547000	551000	It was interesting is this is only a two year look into the company.
551000	553000	Like people have been saying this about the company for a long time.
553000	559000	So it's like let's let's let Jamie finish because there's a lot.
559000	560000	We all got something to say.
560000	561000	I know it.
561000	562000	Yeah.
562000	571000	The complaint is also saying that black women were micromanaged, forced to justify their breaks and requests for time off while no other workers were asked to.
571000	579000	They were also signaled out for their body language and scolded for asking other employees for help when other employees didn't receive similar treatment.
579000	586000	And they also were saying that the companies were hiring women based on their looks.
586000	590000	And again, this is why you should never put your photo on your resume.
590000	594000	Just saying, I think that now it's illegal to do so.
594000	607000	And anyway, other things that this is really disgusting is that there was another senior leader who and this is the quote, engaged in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions.
607000	611000	They alleged the man made advances at women at a work event to female employees.
611000	614000	They wanted to marry them and tried to kiss them and hold them.
614000	630000	And in the lawsuit that states that his office was nicknamed the Cosby suite in reference to Bill Cosby, who was at the time convicted of rape and then released in a very bullshit move.
630000	631000	I'm sick.
631000	634000	It's it's absolutely sick.
634000	648000	And in reading the the injection, sorry, the the lawsuit, like the introduction to it, I'm just going to read a little bit of it.
648000	657000	All right. Headquartered in California since the 1970s were the nation's strongest anti harassment, equal pay and other equal employment opportunity protections exist for employees.
657000	661000	Defendants should have a safe haven workplace in the video game industry.
661000	667000	Sexism has has plagued the male dominated gaming industry for decades and increasingly so in recent years.
667000	673000	Well, many girls now make up half the gamers of America, but the gaming industry continues to cater to men even in California.
673000	686000	Activision Blizzard's double digit percentage growth, 10 figure annual revenues and recent diversity marketing campaigns have unfortunately changed little defendants compliant with California's broad workplace protections.
686000	693000	As long overdue, then that's going into a lot more of it.
693000	701000	And here's one thing in number three, unlike its customer base of increasingly diverse players, defendants workforce is only about 20 percent women.
701000	707000	Its top leadership is also exclusively male and white.
707000	709000	And it looks like a big thing.
709000	719000	You know, I'm actually for those that are in a chat, I am going to link the the the document.
719000	727000	This is very easy to find for those on the podcast, like if you just go to Google News and look for Activision Blizzard lawsuit for the sake of those on.
727000	735000	I'll also say you can look up about be law dot com slash YJW.
735000	741000	But yeah, it it looks like numbers right in the get go.
741000	761000	One of the ones that was really just looking at what their CEO made in 2020 was one million four hundred ninety four two hundred and thirty one dollars and more than that in 2019 and 2018.
761000	775000	Their highest paid female officer, Claudine Naughton, the CPO, the chief people officer, made six hundred fifty five thousand.
775000	784000	The next person in the same group made eight hundred and fifty two thousand two hundred and five dollars.
784000	789000	He made more money than she did for the same job.
789000	801000	So, yeah, there's another one on here to an internal investigation and human resource unit noted there was a big last lack of trust and that H.R. not held in high regard.
801000	810000	Unsurprisingly, employees complaints were either treated in a perfunctory or dismissive manner and not kept confidential as a result of these complaints.
811000	822000	Female employees were subjected to retaliation, including but not limited to being deprived of work on projects and willingly transferred to different units and selected for layoffs.
822000	825000	So that's all I read on that one.
825000	828000	You can read the whole thing yourself if you want.
828000	834000	I'm about ready to pop off, but Jamie, if you want to go first, by all means.
834000	837000	I am.
837000	844000	I have no words for how disgusted I am to name some people by name.
844000	849000	The World of Warcraft senior creative director, that's Alex Afrasyabi.
849000	851000	I hope I pronounced that right.
851000	854000	Actually, I don't care if I pronounced it right.
854000	858000	Would harass female employees either at BlizzCon.
858000	868000	It was an open secret and that they had multiple conversations with him and cautioned him over his drinking and being too friendly toward female employees.
868000	871000	But apparently he kept doing it.
871000	879000	He is a quest and level designer for World of Warcraft and he left the company in June of 2020.
879000	887000	The women on the battle net team were subjected to disparaging comments.
887000	895000	And that women who were quote not huge gamers or into the party scene were treated as outsiders within the company.
895000	899000	It's just so much on here like more and more that I read.
899000	902000	It's absolutely disgusting.
902000	927000	And there's a reason that quote a good faith effort was not made or that those overtures were not considered was because it's been proven that Activision Blizzard's own HR group is intensely inept and or does not care to act because they're in on it.
927000	936000	They probably get something, you know, from, you know, maybe some of the other employees to sweep things under the rug.
936000	944000	There's also, gosh, I'm trying to look at just some other things on here. Yeah, the cube crawls.
945000	958000	Let me I want to get to a chat comment that's really good and I think important in the context of all this. So, of course, we do tape live. We have our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network and our pal Tay plays games from the Debbie.
958000	966000	Debbie delight scene is in chat and gives us a very, I think a very important comment we should keep in mind. I've got some stuff to say.
966000	976000	My partner has worked at Blizzard for over 13 years he is a rape survivor and a gay man, I'd like to remind everyone that the vast, vast majority of people who work at these companies are good people who want to do their jobs.
976000	988000	There are queer people, women and people of color who work at Blizzard, and are trying to do their jobs and change the culture from the inside. Let's be mindful of when we talk about these companies we are condemning the bad actors, those who have perpetuated discrimination
988000	991000	of any kind, as well as company leadership.
991000	1000000	100%, I agree with that comment. That is why when I see the knee jerk response of we have to boycott Blizzard over this.
1000000	1002000	I don't think that is the correct action.
1002000	1006000	And there's a couple, there's a couple reasons for that. There's a couple reasons that number one.
1006000	1012000	I thought everybody was already boycotting Blizzard over the Hong Kong stuff didn't seem to be very effective did it.
1013000	1026000	Number two, boycotts are going to affect the folks that Tay is talking about, and you even bring it up in the lawsuit there about the layoffs and those types of things that you bring up there.
1026000	1034000	The people that aren't a problem, aren't the cause of the problem are the ones that are going to be targeted by those sorts of things.
1035000	1044000	However, I do think that the lawsuit may force the changes that needed to happen.
1044000	1059000	Yes, yes, and, and this is what's effective. Yes, and that's the part so I want to clarify something I said earlier because in the beginning I said, you know, here, here we go again this news doesn't, you know, make me happier I don't know what I said at the beginning,
1059000	1072000	but I think y'all know which part I'm talking about hearing about these disgusting stories that Jamie just outlined that's the part I don't like a major major component of what makes this story different from this story we have heard way too many fucking times
1072000	1081000	at this point. And by the way, if you want to boycott Blizzard. I hope you're boycotting Ubisoft, I hope I hope you're boycotting gaming right now.
1081000	1092000	You should just not be playing video games, and while you're at it, stay off of Twitter. This is stay off of Facebook stay off of Twitch staff of Amazon.
1092000	1094000	That is the note.
1094000	1099000	If you're going to take the boycott route you have to boycott the whole, the whole ecosystem.
1099000	1117000	That is the unfortunate part of this is that this Activision Blizzard is just the latest. It's, it's a, it's a fucking whack a mole game right now. It is the latest example of rot in this industry that we as fans we that love video games we that have had our
1117000	1135000	lives, improved, enriched enhanced communities built around video games. These stories that we are fucking sick of hearing, because we want this industry to be taken seriously, but time and time again, the people in charge are letting us down.
1135000	1149000	And quite frankly, how dare. How dare j alan brack go out there on Twitter and leave that note about why I'm very, I'm very surprised to hear about these types of things and I'm so disappointed.
1149000	1155000	You know what, there were there were four words missing from that statement.
1155000	1159000	I resign, effective tomorrow.
1159000	1163000	Yeah, that is actually that is what is needed.
1163000	1170000	Take out the trash. Yeah, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Yes.
1170000	1186000	So, yes, I'll say so I think what we can celebrate, which is a weird word to use I'm sorry, but, and in this is a theme we've talked about in gaming over the last few years, if you if the gaming industry cannot solve the problem.
1186000	1196000	The government is going to step in and fix it for them, which might not be the solution they want. And we've said that about violence and video games right that's why the ESRB was founded right.
1196000	1204000	We've said that about loot boxes and video games, which has been something that you know the government's hovering over that. Well, you know what the big difference here.
1204000	1217000	The state of California has now shown up to the table to say, we're, we're now gonna, we're now going to order some fixes, we're not going to mandate some fixes. And that's the part where I go, finally.
1217000	1226000	Finally, our effect elected officials at work, because quite honestly, what I think needs to happen with this. I think a Senate hearing needs to happen with this.
1226000	1239000	I know that sounds really radical and crazy. But that's, that's the level of visibility this entire industry needs. This is not an Activision Blizzard problem specifically, it's an industry problem.
1239000	1241000	And it's time to lay it out.
1241000	1254000	I don't even know if it's just this industry I mean there's lots of industries where this is a problem but like obviously if it prompted them to investigate it there was a lot more like I don't like how they just sweep it under the rug and say oh it's.
1254000	1267000	We're so shocked you know it's like it's not because like obviously if it led up to that. There's been lots of complaints they don't just take the first complaint that comes to them go okay now we're going to investigate like they normally, if there's a lot of complaints, then that's
1267000	1274000	when you're seeing a lawsuit and then we finally a lawsuit if they didn't have evidence so like, I don't know.
1274000	1281000	I think that if there's any sort of offer for an out of court settlement, I think it should be rejected.
1281000	1284000	This needs to be public and stay public.
1284000	1301000	And I think, as far as what can we do it when we're trying to think you know and I know a lot of people especially like if you stream Overwatch stuff and World of Warcraft stuff it's like, I don't want to give up my community, because a bunch of people were
1302000	1306000	really didn't impact the final product of the hardworking frontline.
1306000	1319000	Exactly. What can we do. Here's what we can do. We can write our elected officials and encourage them to keep doing this, because unfortunately the gaming industry has proven they can't take care of it themselves.
1319000	1331000	Well, and I have to, I have to say, it's actually a gosh when did they do the podcast, it was even earlier this year or last year.
1331000	1343000	But one of my favorite podcasts, which is stuff you missed in history class, hosted by my friends, Annie and Samantha.
1343000	1360000	They did one about women in gaming, and what it's like to be a woman in the industry and what it's like to be a woman gaming, you know we actually make up more than half now of the gaming community.
1360000	1385000	Yet, the companies ignore this. We're harassed online whenever we try to, you know, play games, an online game, or a lot of, you know, a lot of streamers who identify female or close to it can get some rest but that's actually why I quit streaming before. Did you know that?
1385000	1401000	I know, I do know that you more so than Loki and I have faced a scrutiny here on OLR over the years, I know that for a fact. So, led to my, my two year hiatus from streaming.
1401000	1419000	I mean, I just just to be clear, I sometimes get the emails because you know I sometimes get the emails what very rare especially anymore but I should I get the emails that are like, you know, you can pray the gay away you can change I do get those types of things once in a while, but you get the shut the fuck up and get back in the kitchen emails.
1419000	1421000	And that's disgusting.
1421000	1434000	I do get this. I should see some of it so I can make fun of them. It's, it's been a long time. You have been a long time. The first one that says that I need to make sandwiches and I'm like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
1434000	1441000	It was honestly though, I have really thick skin with the show, and with being online.
1441000	1444000	But there are.
1444000	1457000	There are some things that I've just like, I got sick of it, and I'm more stubborn I don't let people chase me off of anything but I was just like look I don't have time for this shit right now, so I quit, I quit, I was done.
1457000	1470000	I think the last thing I had streamed was hot to full boyfriend. At the time, which I need to do again, but I yeah I took I took however long off just because I was, I was done with it.
1470000	1493000	And the thing is, is that when we now make up equal if not more of the gaming population. We need to also be that well represented within the industry as an employee as a game designer, doing music, doing graphic design, branding SEO all of it that goes into the video game industry.
1493000	1502000	We need to have equal representation within the industry as much as a consumer in the industry. Makes sense.
1502000	1516000	Absolutely. I want to get some more comments from chat you guys are lighting it up with good stuff I'm sorry I can't get to everything, but our pal Tay is also saying evergreen thing you can do uplift the voices of marginalized people shut the fuck up and listen to what they have to say.
1516000	1528000	Yes, men, be better. Yes, the onus is on you to call out your friends, when they say say stupid shit. I, the message here is not that every man in the world has done something wrong.
1528000	1539000	But the point is that when you illustrate that story about the cube game where they're they're drunk crawling the queue this all this. That's not one person.
1539000	1549000	That's a group of people, it would have taken one person within that group of people to say, this is fucked up.
1549000	1558000	And this is actually going back to something that was a part of. Do you remember the hashtag that was going around yes all men.
1558000	1561000	Oh yeah yeah yeah I do.
1561000	1566000	And this is going back to that because it's enough.
1566000	1582000	Men or says, men in general, that it breaks our trust, you know, women, women identified pair of female, you know, Demi female like like myself.
1582000	1586000	I'm going to use women loosely in that, in that respect.
1586000	1592000	Is this enough that we're wary of all.
1592000	1604000	I mean, and hell even. I even am wary around gay men that I don't know, because I've before been groped and said it's okay honey I'm gay.
1604000	1611000	Yeah, no, it's not okay. It's not okay, you touch me without my permission. Yeah.
1611000	1615000	The only time I don't get that is when I'm in sister face.
1615000	1624000	Absolutely disgusting but anyway going back to this though, is that, you know, we.
1624000	1627000	And I'm going to actually go into a little bit of a history lesson. Okay.
1627000	1644000	So, back in the day, maybe late 1800s, early 1900s, we had, you know, longer than the regular five day 40 hour week, we had child labor rampant, there were very few regulations.
1644000	1651000	And it was when people came together to form unions.
1651000	1669000	They unionized, they spoke out and they made shit happen. And that's why we have a 40 hour work week and we have you know the general five day and we have weekends and time off and these regulations, because people got together, and they made the shit happen.
1669000	1689000	And that is 1000%, why the video game industry needs its own union or series of unions, and every time tech and gaming industries have tried to unionize, they've been shut down people have been fired it's happened with Google.
1689000	1701000	There's been silencing all across the board, anti union, sort of thing of anti union propaganda being spread.
1701000	1715000	And it's time to honestly I think it's almost time to restructure our concept of unions and
1715000	1721000	have more people involved in them make them more grassroots make them.
1721000	1730000	I mean they're fairly powerful we saw what happened, I still need to figure out the rest of what happened with the SAG AFTA strike.
1730000	1754000	But this is why we need unions, we need the regulations and we need these protections in place. And we need not, I wouldn't even say necessarily government intervention like government oversight, but we need a completely unbiased third party oversight
1754000	1762000	group that inspects both the companies and inspects the way the government is handling it.
1762000	1776000	I think the government's going to always say that they're doing it right. I think that is a solution that that may need to happen here, as much as, you know, I think a lot of us go oh the government that's going to own that's never good news and all that stuff,
1776000	1791000	and I totally get that perspective, like government regulation and oversight is where this is all headed. That's the bottom line I think to all this because this is an epidemic in the industry, you know Activision Blizzard is who we're talking about this week.
1791000	1801000	But unless action starts like now, I think every company in the gaming industry, every company in the gaming industry should be responding to this news this week internally.
1801000	1814000	Ubisoft, I mean look at the world. Thank, thank goodness for Ubisoft not being in the United States because otherwise they'd probably already be under this type of scrutiny as it is. But, yeah, I mean there's plenty of companies and examples of different companies
1814000	1817000	it's, it's definitely industry wide.
1817000	1818000	Yeah.
1819000	1827000	Well, and I see it very brings up another point that I was going to bring up unionizing on its own is not enough the union needs to be regulated to be held accountable by its members.
1827000	1828000	Absolutely.
1828000	1844000	And that's why I'm saying, you know, we need proper oversight, I personally think that all government agencies need to have non government oversight reporting on them.
1844000	1859000	You know, have outside agencies look at their budgets etc but that's, that's a completely different topic but now someone like my mother would come in and say, well that regulation it's going to make us just like North Korea.
1859000	1864000	And I bring up North Korea because I've been watching a lot of documentaries about the regime.
1864000	1884000	But it's not. This is the thing is that we already have a culture that understands that freedom, freedom of speech freedom to act. That's fine but the consequences need to be in place so that people are not going to take advantage of it.
1884000	1892000	As an advantage at the expense of other people, your rights, and where they infringe on mine.
1892000	1893000	Make sense.
1893000	1895000	Uh huh.
1895000	1908000	And, and actually today was bringing up something else that that I absolutely agree with over half the states in this country have right to work laws, which effectively cripple any power unions have.
1908000	1923000	So yes, we do need more government involvement in the form of rewriting labor laws, absolutely. But we also do need to make sure that there's oversight, that is from without both the company and the government.
1923000	1937000	So, and obviously all of these things we're talking about sadly are not going to be remedied in a week. By the time we can, by the time we get to next week show, we are not going to be able to wave the flag and celebrate hooray sexism and misogyny has been
1937000	1941000	eliminated in our industry. Nope, that will not be a headline next week.
1941000	1954000	I have my own thoughts on this I think that our country is too big to effectively have a central government, and that I think that states aren't necessarily the way to go either but that's a completely different philosophy.
1954000	1961000	But I think also in the, in the short term, you know, I know we don't have a ton of industry people listening to this show.
1961000	1963000	But there's a few.
1963000	1975000	And I hope you all at least feel empowered. After this, I mean, I would hope folks felt that way already but to report those types of things as you see them and call this shit out.
1975000	1981000	Look for especially for micro aggressions, which is usually a symptom of a much larger problem.
1981000	1991000	And now, now, you know, now you know, if nothing else now you know if your HR department's not doing shit. There's a California department there's a department in your state.
1991000	1994000	That's probably building up case files.
1994000	2001000	Mm hmm. Quite frankly, and, and I want to say something that I said on Bobby stream before us. Yeah, Bobby stream.
2001000	2015000	Bobby show discuss the show I've been doing a little too much, um, that, just because you don't see it just because it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
2015000	2026000	You know, I, I, I'm going to use a really stupid example. I've never had tattoos therefore no one ever has them. What is this thing on your body.
2026000	2033000	No, just because I've never had a tattoo doesn't mean that other people don't have tattoos and don't think that they heard or that they're beautiful or whatever.
2033000	2041000	My husband might have something to say on that if you've been paying attention to his blogs this past week, I know, Alan got his first tattoo if you didn't know.
2041000	2055000	Um, but my point goes back to it is just like just because no one's ever given me shit for the color of my skin doesn't mean that other people aren't being given shit for the color of their skin.
2055000	2079000	Just because, um, like I'll say just because Dan can go out and pretty much have his walk of the world because he's a white straight man, you know, doesn't mean that I can have the same thing happen because I am an asexual para female, you know, my experience is going to be different.
2079000	2095000	I'm going to have people going well that's weird or you're not into that what that means you're broken. I've had doctors try to cure me, you know, it's, but that's not the experience that allosexuals might have, you know, I'm using as an example.
2095000	2111000	Everyone's experience is going to be different. And just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. That's why we need more diversity we need these different voices and we need these different levels of experience to be in on it and speak on these things.
2111000	2128000	We need to shut up and listen to each other. We're too busy, and even just in an everyday conversation right. We're too busy reacting or thinking about what we want to say on it to actually listen to what the other party has to say.
2128000	2133000	We, we talk to react, we don't talk to listen.
2134000	2143000	I want to get one more comment from Tay here he's been given a lot of good comments throughout the night. Many of these video game companies are headquartered in California, which has comparatively strong labor protections.
2143000	2159000	The problem is which employees want to potentially get fired by sticking their neck out to form a union. The catch 22 is very real unfortunately, yeah, and that is things we need our government to, you know, ensure is certainly that they're like whistleblower protections
2159000	2172000	in all industries and that people that do come forward and speak on these issues are protected. I think that is, you know, one huge thing. I again we're unfortunately we're not going to get there next week, even though I wish we could.
2172000	2181000	But I like we need to keep using our voices to push our government, which at the end of the day is supposed to work for us to do these things.
2181000	2192000	The last thing that they said to very simple concepts called empathy. This is why finding people who don't look like you sound like you are believing the same things as an active effort.
2192000	2214000	Yes. A thousand times yes. And I just went through. It wasn't assigned to me but I did the training at work, anyway, about the place that empathy has in the comp in my company that I worked for about the spirit of collaboration, and about how diversifying your, your worker
2214000	2229000	base and listening to those different concepts, makes a better stronger company, it makes a better stronger employee when you are listening to other people, and taking wisdom from their experiences.
2229000	2250000	So, it's absolutely empathy, it's, it's not being able to go oh well that's too bad you're going that sympathy right empathy means that you're making an effort to personalize what another person feels to try to put yourself in their shoes.
2250000	2263000	I understand, even if you really can't do it because you haven't experienced it though, you're listening to them, and you're incorporating that into your experience so that you have a broader scope that you can put yourselves in those shoes.
2263000	2267000	Does that make sense. Oh yeah.
2267000	2282000	I don't know what else can be said on this at this time I think that's probably a good note to move on to our next topic on, I'm sure this is going to be something that's going to be revisited in the coming weeks, and hopefully in the context of.
2282000	2292000	Here's some reform here's some real action that's happening here are some CEO resignations that are badly needed right now, the world to change an old phrase of ours.
2292000	2295000	Maybe a system is only as good as the people in it.
2295000	2296000	Maybe.
2296000	2306000	All right, let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, so dark Sakura, I'm back to you because I always start with you how was your gaming week.
2306000	2310000	I hadn't been playing well.
2310000	2318000	Honestly, I haven't played since they got they banished my space elf husband again.
2318000	2327000	I have been playing, of course, a lot of dead by daylight I have goals now and that is to get every character at least a 40.
2327000	2334000	And I said, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna put the points in dinner so when they have Strider and I'm going to use that with spirit and it's going to be fun.
2334000	2339000	No they're nerfing Strider, so I'm doing it now for.
2339000	2346000	I know it's a sin out of phobia but I always mess up and call it Thanos topia.
2346000	2357000	You know, so, so that's been it of course I've been doing it on stream and I've brought in a new Saturday midnight stream will technically Sunday morning midnight, but yeah, I've been doing that.
2357000	2360000	I've also been playing fantastic Asian.
2360000	2369000	People wanted to watch me grind so I let them watch me grind. And I'm getting ready to move on to the second part of the game.
2369000	2377000	I'm so pleased that there's going to be a part two. I love temptation, it's such a good little RPG.
2377000	2382000	If you've got any kind of Apple device and you have Apple Arcade.
2382000	2392000	This game is absolutely worth the subscription for Apple Arcade, it is, it is delightful done by so many of the Final Fantasy folks.
2392000	2403000	I've been doing word word scapes, a lot because I mean, it's, it's my brain wake up it's you know what I used to kind of get my brain going.
2403000	2415000	And I'm going to start preparing myself for a streaming marathon. I wanted to do it next month in face as a sister.
2415000	2416000	Fun.
2416000	2423000	Um, and I don't know if I can play that much Dead by Daylight without getting completely pissed off at humanity in general.
2423000	2434000	But I'm thinking that I might do that and maybe the Colonel Sanders game and Hataful Boyfriend and Dream Daddy, because you know I love my dating sims.
2434000	2439000	Do some music games, go back to your roots do some, how about some Busta Move.
2439000	2446000	But the thing is, is that I don't have the stuff to stream console properly on my Mac.
2446000	2457000	We gotta figure that is, I'm gonna, I'm actually looking at another streaming device, kind of a wireless streaming device.
2457000	2460000	But I'm also thinking of.
2460000	2471000	I've got some lovely motherboards for my, my old PC but what I think I also need in it is a new graphics card.
2471000	2481000	And I'm looking like it models three years old because there's no, I mean, I was actually in losing colors stream earlier because they were streaming a little bit early today.
2481000	2490000	And we're talking about graphics cards, and just how ridiculously expensive that they've become and I was trying to help shop around because I've got some good resources.
2490000	2505000	And I'm probably going to be looking for like a three year old radio on or something like that, just because I want something a little bit better than I have but I don't need it for anything better than the, the mass effect.
2505000	2519000	And I still have to see if windows arm will play mass effect better now that there's new updates for it. So, anyway, that's kind of been where I've been.
2519000	2529000	Oh, and that's odd. That was unexpected. Okay, so something weird has happened and we'd like lost Jamie. I don't know if that was the up, and she came right back.
2529000	2534000	You okay. Yeah, I don't know what happened but I got kicked out of chat.
2534000	2540000	What was the last thing that I thought I ended and then I heard the blip and then.
2540000	2545000	Yeah, it's all it's like you had an internet hiccup or something so that's strange.
2545000	2551000	Actually, I mean it actually kicked me out of the chat so yeah, which is when my internet goes down.
2551000	2558000	Weird. Oh, as long as my, my full thought made it out, then that's awesome.
2558000	2564000	I think so yes, but your cameras off I don't know if you know, I'll reconnect it. Cool.
2564000	2568000	Um, let's go over to Loki How was your gaming week.
2568000	2583000	It wasn't very eventful. It was all rendering is what it was, I saw a new video today though. So yeah, something a long time, like, I, the build took a long time so I finished basically.
2583000	2594000	If you watch my content and you really should if you're not. I finished the build they started with the tango visit they had from hermit craft, like last month.
2594000	2609000	And so based on what we had sort of built a little wall. I had come up with a concept and built it in in the server. And so I finished that, like the actual build I think a week or so ago.
2609000	2623000	And then it was just the because we're in the brand new 117. A lot of the plugins and things that would normally make Minecraft run a lot better, especially with, you know, shaders and whatnot.
2623000	2642000	They're all kind of beta right now and so stuff doesn't work quite right. And so I had to run off the fine with the replay mod in order to get it to render with shaders on and off the fines not really optimized right now for 117 and so because of that it took
2642000	2656000	I had nine different clips nine different time lapses to render out and it took about two to three hours per video, which sucks because I ended up cutting those down to about 30 seconds each for my time lapse.
2656000	2679000	So it was a good like week long rendering. All of my evenings were rendering out like content for the video. And then I decided to dabble in After Effects and do some stuff that at the end of the video with that. And that took a long time because I individually each frame adjusted the lighting to get the lighting look like it was in the in the game.
2679000	2705000	And it's 60 frames per second too. So but man, I tell you, like, even though it it sucks doing that. It looks so good. Like I've watched the end of my video at least 25 times already. And I'm just I'm so impressed with myself with what I did. But yeah, so basically kind of I finished the bill that kind of talked about like what I did with that stuff.
2705000	2734000	And then I allude to some other like lore stuff that's going to be happening as well. Because like I said, there's not a lot of people to talk to on the server. Although ironically today, though, like when I get home, people want to talk. And so I like was actually in chat with like four or five people at the same time, for like a good hour or so. So that was kind of nice. But normally in game, I don't get to talk to people. And so I have to kind of come up with something to try to entertain the viewers. I have what few of them there are, I've like done everything to harm myself out out there.
2734000	2763000	And I can't, I can't get anybody to watch my videos. Like everybody says like, how the hell did you get someone from hermitcraft to like, you know, basically collab with you and like, they're impressed by that. But like, I can't get anybody to watch my content. Like I don't know what to do. So I like I seriously am out there like every I'm, I'm on like, lots of different discords different, you know, chat rooms. I haven't hit the forums. That's one thing I need to do is hit up some of those forums.
2763000	2792000	But like, I don't know, I'm trying to promote myself as best I can. So it's been a little bit of Minecraft this week, but mostly video editing was all week. And so now the timer is reset. And so now I got to jam out some more content for next week, hopefully. But it, yeah, it's exciting. I have some plans. I have some very ambitious plans, like always, I can't just leave it to be the most simple thing ever. Because I don't know.
2793000	2810000	Like I said, I'm trying to get the attention of the folks on hermitcraft so that, you know, someday I can join them. And the only way I can do that is go big, like just big and fast. I got to just really try to do some ridiculous stuff. And that's what I'm trying to do.
2810000	2829000	Just keep pushing as best you can. I know it's a lot. It'll be really nice when conventions start to come back. Like, obviously, I know some of the things going on with Delta and all that stuff are causing a lot of question marks. But I think the reality is that is that is a problem of the unvaccinated at this point.
2829000	2843000	For those that are, you know, getting vaccinated, we'll be at these conventions sooner rather than later. And this is gonna be nice to be back in person. And you'll get to the kind of network amongst people face to face. And there's there's nothing better than networking face to face.
2843000	2872920	Well, I've been, you know, not to try to like, you know, I haven't talked to the server admins. And like I said, I've been pretty transparent with them about like, listen, this season? Yes. But like next season, that's still question mark. I've been shopping around, not really shopping around, but I've been looking around to see like, what else is out there, like other groups of people are kind of similar things, they're doing more content creation. And I found a few different groups that do that. So I've been trying to connect with them a little bit. But like, even today, I was talking with some people on the server. And
2872920	2902520	there's like, there's one guy that he was in one of my videos, like a little bit, he made some comments and stuff. And he was his hilarious. I like, I really liked playing with him. But like, I haven't seen him in weeks. And so we got him on a voice call today. And this first time I've ever talked to him. And he's like, Oh, yeah, I'm not even playing on that server anymore. I'm playing on this server. It's like, we're losing people all the time. Like, we lost just, I can think of at least five people that have left. And it's just it's making it difficult with all this attrition that we get on the
2902520	2916320	server, like it to actually have people what I did connect with some people today, and you know, even someone that's doing content stuff. So I'm pretty excited to get to, you know, play with them a little bit. I did find out today, though, I'm the oldest person on the server. So that's nice.
2916320	2946320	But yeah, but whatever. I mean, it's fine. I would like to play with more people my age, but it's fine. You know what, I'm totally cool with that. But like, it was really nice to get to talk to people today. And I really hope to do more of that. I want to have more people like actually in the video and talking with them and stuff like that and interacting. I just I'm trying to remind them like, like, Hey, listen, you know, I, you know, me, I'm like, I used to swear all the time, you probably haven't noticed, like, since we've been doing a remote, I have no idea what's going on, like, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what
2946320	2976320	happened been swearing a lot. I've pretty much not been swearing at all on this show.
2976320	2980340	Makes sense to do that. And also my kids watch my content. So can't do that either.
2980340	2987060	So that's why I haven't been as ranty and cursy as I have been in the past. But anyway,
2987060	2990820	sorry, I'm rambling. No, I'm sorry.
2990820	2996740	No, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry at all. I bet. Hey, Bobby Blackwell will probably
2996740	2998140	have you back on his show now.
2998140	3004020	Yeah, I can totally go on his show now because I'm not cursing anymore. All right. Now, let's
3004020	3009920	make it clear, though, during the day when I'm working, oh, my God is just just constant
3009920	3015600	expletives all the time, especially when my kids gone and stuff like that. It's just all
3015600	3020000	day long. So I get it all out during the week. It's just, you know, games and like video
3020000	3022000	time. I don't do that.
3022000	3026520	I tase and chat. There are lots of people in chat besides tape. There's just a lot of
3026520	3031100	good comments tonight with a suggestion for Loki and promotion saying I hate to say it.
3031100	3036200	But if you want to drive people to your YouTube channel, posting clips on TikTok is very,
3036200	3041600	very valuable. There's a huge amount of Minecraft stuff on TikTok and editing 30 second or minute
3041600	3045800	long clips isn't too much investment to throw on there. That's a really good idea, especially
3045800	3048880	since you got that guy that's very popular.
3048880	3053280	Yeah, you should you should really like find a 30 second or minute clip from and put the
3053280	3058880	hashtags and don't forget to use some of his hashtags, too. I bet that'll really help.
3058880	3063380	I can do that. Yeah, it's going against it's going against everything I believe about TikTok.
3063380	3068620	But yeah, it's actually been a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
3068620	3072140	I know I tease my wife all the time because she watches TikTok all the time.
3072140	3076080	I still don't understand how to make content for it. But that's you know, that's also there's
3076080	3081040	also shorts to YouTube shorts is another thing because the algorithm with the shorts is much
3081040	3085300	different than with the actual content. You can actually grow your channel a lot faster
3085300	3089400	with shorts, but I just haven't really made a lot of that short form content yet. But
3089400	3094680	I'm sure I could try to edit some stuff together. There's also going the tutorial route as well.
3094680	3100300	I don't really want to do that. But like that does get a lot of views to your channel. So
3100300	3102300	it may be something to consider.
3102300	3106180	Dr. Tia and Chad are saying I honestly didn't really notice about the swearing thing until
3106180	3111300	you brought it up. So yeah, yeah, I know. It's just Yeah, I haven't really been doing
3111300	3116600	it too much just mainly well because of the Hermitcraft stuff because I like I said, I
3116600	3121240	I'm trying to get on there and I know it's in such an impossible like thing to do. But
3121240	3124640	it would be nice I would really appreciate it. But there's lots of groups out there that
3124640	3128400	I would like to play with like one of the ones I discovered this week I've been watching
3128400	3133940	a lot more YouTube and Twitch content lately like a lot lot more. And so one of the groups
3133940	3137940	I did find there's a group called pleasant craft that actually is a bunch of content
3137940	3142500	creators. Their channels are a bit bigger than mine, but not like huge like you know
3142500	3149100	3000 1000 ish and they have like a pretty like active community. Now not everyone streams
3149100	3153760	on there. Most of the people do and ironically enough, the guy that I found it through which
3153760	3158900	is a guy called game time but they're who streams actually right about now. He actually
3158900	3163060	streams on his own server but he's a member of pleasant crafting doesn't stream from there
3163060	3167480	which is weird but that's how I discovered them because I've been looking for more groups
3167480	3172600	of people that are active like that. There's the other guy that left our server dad's dad
3172600	3178360	he has a sector 17. But the concern I have with them is there's people streaming on right
3178360	3184580	now but it's not very many and speaking with him not all the people stream on their server
3184580	3188460	it's only like a handful of people and I have a feeling that's going to be like ours where
3188460	3192420	there's a handful of people at the beginning but then it dies off so I'm waiting to see
3192420	3198820	how that goes but all right we'll see as the minecraft world turns we'll see on next
3198820	3204020	week exactly my gaming week so I've I've been playing a little bit of dev by daylight as
3204020	3209500	well not as much as dark sakura but actually not as much this week compared to previous
3209500	3213700	weeks just because there's been a lot of other stuff going on I've been playing a little
3213700	3219420	bit of Final Fantasy 14 still trying to get all my classes 80 for the next expansion I'm
3219420	3223900	getting closer my warrior hit 60 that's one of three jobs left that I don't have at max level
3223900	3229420	so I've been working on that but otherwise I've been continuing in another game I've talked about
3229420	3236020	recently on the show still loving Yakuza like a dragon I just finished chapter six like an hour
3236020	3241780	before the show started tonight so and I believe there's 15 chapters in the game so but I feel like
3241780	3245860	the chapters are moving faster than the first couple chapters did that really kind of set up
3245860	3251220	the story but at the same time there's a lot more as the world's opened up there's things you can do
3251220	3258780	and the game is just hilarious and at times but it's also got just a really fascinating story and
3258780	3263660	it just it that with the combat the way it is and everything it it does feel like I'm playing like a
3263660	3269100	Final Fantasy esque modern type of game and I'm really into it I can't believe none of you out
3269100	3273500	there suggested I ever play this game like why didn't any of you bring this to my attention I
3274380	3282500	was watching I'm just I'm being a shit because everybody's been telling me to play this game
3282500	3289100	it just took me forever yeah I was I was watching him play it a little bit too and I had to stop
3289100	3294940	because he got past where I'm at I want to ruin it for myself so yeah I'm really sad about that
3294940	3302260	but yeah I'm really enjoying the like a dragon and trying to get some of the side I'm very like I've
3302260	3307260	got to do all the side quests that I can do and all the and there's a lot of like stuff that's
3307260	3311620	building up I still haven't gotten the dragon cart stuff but I think I'm close my characters
3311620	3317220	are just all got around like level 20 so I think I get to that part of the game soon so stay tuned
3317220	3324420	and then the other game I've spent quite a bit of time playing this week actually is the brand new
3324420	3330780	MOBA that just came out this week Pokemon unite that is free to play on the Nintendo switch and
3330820	3336220	a lot of people are talking about this game because it's Pokemon and it's free to play so
3336220	3339060	there's been a lot of people that have been downloading this and checking it out and I got
3339060	3346660	to say you know it's interesting because Nintendo oftentimes gets a lot of shit for not being at the
3346660	3353100	at the peak of their game when it comes to online functionality I think releasing a Pokemon MOBA is
3353100	3358380	one of those exceptions where them lagging behind a little bit is actually really helping them and
3358380	3363260	I'm actually really thankful there is no postgame chat because that's the worst thing about any MOBA
3363260	3369700	is the postgame chat or during game chat or any of that stuff or live chat I still now that's not
3369700	3374820	to say I think Nintendo should still like I think they're just surrendering to discord when their
3374820	3379980	app fails to allow you to voice chat with your friends when you're playing a game but I digress
3379980	3388340	Pokemon unite it's a very good introduction to MOBAs and you learn pretty quickly about you know
3388340	3392780	the concept of like lanes and you know trying to get to the end the goal and there's like little
3392780	3396980	mini fortresses before you get to the end goal it's just that they've kind of changed it up so
3396980	3401820	it all fits this Pokemon theme where you're trying to you know score goals and if you get enough
3401820	3406580	goals then you kind of like destroy the goal point and of course you play as a particular Pokemon and
3406620	3412140	you can of course if you want to spend money buy more Pokemon although you might earn some very
3412140	3418220	slowly so I'm enjoying playing the game it you are it is very slow to unlock certain parts of
3418220	3423340	the game like I just got quick play which I didn't even because I was gonna come on here and say god
3423340	3428660	I wish there was more than one map to play on because this game seems very bare bones oh there's
3428660	3434340	more maps in quick play because there's like five minute games there as opposed to Timothy I still
3434380	3439380	think this game is very obviously in its infancy and there's going to be plenty more to come more
3439380	3447700	Pokemon more maps and things like that so I think that'll be good the other like issue with Pokemon
3447700	3454820	unite is that I there have already been several expose or I suppose they've been exposed on the
3454820	3460860	free-to-play practices and just how much of an advantage pouring money into the game and
3460860	3466060	upgrading items and things like that can give you there was a whole little analysis done where
3466060	3471300	somebody bought like all the max upgrades for one of the Pokemon and was basically able to take out
3471300	3480700	the entire other team by so there's some serious balance issues and I understand that you know
3480700	3484700	because there's a part of me it's like I wish Nintendo would just put this out as a $60 game
3484700	3489180	with everything unlocked maybe charging for cosmetics maybe but just like let people have
3489180	3493740	the full experience but I understand I guess that's not in their vision and most MOBAs don't
3493740	3499540	go that way but most MOBAs are pretty balanced where even if somebody pours money into the game
3499540	3506780	one person can't take out the entire other team so but but it's new it just came out this week
3506780	3511300	some things are gonna have to be looked at I'm sure so I'm gonna give them the benefit of the
3511300	3516420	doubt in that regard we'll check in in a month and see where things are at with that but yeah
3516460	3522900	as far as like I don't play MOBAs but what are they I think Pokemon unites a good entry into
3522900	3529140	them just to check it out and see what it's all about and you know it's Pokemon there's a bit of
3529140	3532300	it that if you've ever played a Pokemon game in your life you're gonna pick up pretty naturally
3532300	3539820	and yeah there's there's a lot I'm I'm really looking forward to with the game as it continues
3539820	3545980	to develop and more stuff comes out Mike Deft in our chat by the way I want to congratulate
3546260	3553540	Mike Deft's podcast the GFM cast for hitting five years this was their five-year show or should I
3553540	3563860	say Cinco años show because their show is all in Spanish of course so and that's that's the
3563860	3570260	unfortunate thing you can very much tell I don't really speak Spanish so I I'm not able to listen
3570260	3575140	to the podcast as much as I'd like and really give that feedback but I Mike Deft has been a
3575140	3580260	huge support of OLR here over the years so I'm just gonna support him because I like the guy
3580260	3589860	and I'm gonna say a big thank you for and congrats for the five-year milestone there let's see Tae in
3589860	3595580	chat says all the 11 year olds with mom's credit card Nintendo is printing money as we speak yeah
3595580	3599380	it's just a matter of time before the mobile phone version of that game comes out and then I think
3599380	3604420	there's gonna be even more people into it but you know they're gonna get called out for brain being
3604420	3608580	predatory if they don't really balance out some of these issues so we'll try to give them the
3608580	3614580	benefit out I already noticed that like once I got to level 8 the crawl to level 9 is like whoa
3614580	3620500	it's way slower to get to level 9 and there's still things I have to unlock like just like
3620500	3626320	basic like the ability to hold a third item the ability to upgrade my items is unlocked at level
3626320	3632220	9 so I'm still making my way there and working there so yeah but I even you you can play with
3632220	3636180	your friends like Shane and I were playing the other like I fired up a discord chat and we were
3636180	3641100	talking over the phone and we you're able to get in the same lobby and so it you know like overwatch
3641100	3646220	or whatever other game is 5v5 even if you only have two or three you just join the matchmaking
3646220	3653940	and it finds the rest of people for you so yeah so yeah I'll continue to play Pokemon unite try to
3653940	3659980	get into one or two games where I can so it's it's cute you know if nothing else it's free so
3659980	3664740	the only thing you have to waste is your time Tay plays games says how long is an average game
3664740	3669860	the games are capped at 10 minutes that is the difference between that and other MOBAs is that
3669860	3674020	other MOBAs they don't finish until the enemy base is destroyed these games are capped at 10
3674020	3678780	minutes and if you play quick play it's capped at 5 minutes so that is also you have to remember
3678780	3683140	this game is also gonna be on mobile phones so they have to have things that are mobile phone
3683140	3688060	attention span length so I actually think that's another strength and I've had games go less than
3688060	3694260	10 minutes because I have not seen this ability to do this but I have not to shoot my own horn
3694260	3699780	I'm so fucking good that I've played against teams that surrendered the match before it was
3699780	3706420	over I don't know what the rules are how that happens but yeah I by the way I'm an Eldegoss
3706420	3710100	main and the reason why I love to play Eldegoss which I never thought would be like my main
3710100	3715160	Pokemon the Eldegoss is the only Pokemon that does like any sort of direct healing heal healing
3715160	3722160	and shielding on others and so I love being a support so yeah love that yeah Tay says League
3722160	3728120	takes 45 minutes on average no ma'am the MOBA I enjoyed the most previously was Heroes of the
3728120	3733760	Storm and those matches would you go could still go on for a little while I really enjoyed Heroes
3733760	3739640	of the Storm I'm very sad that Blizzard decided not to keep investing a lot more resources into
3739640	3744560	that I really wish they had because I was having fun with that but it is what it is so alright
3744960	3750520	that's it for my gaming week let's move on um is there any housekeeping I need to get to I do want
3750520	3760000	to say quickly I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend along with other person
3760000	3764720	here at the voice geeks Network Bobby Black Wolf will be there as well yes it's still happening
3764720	3769280	with everything going on in the world I would encourage you to come if you're vaccinated if
3769280	3775280	you're not vaccinated I don't think you should come but I it's everybody's personal choice at
3775280	3779160	the end of the day but just with everything going on in the world I'm just saying it's you're you're
3779160	3783880	gonna be putting yourself in a much bigger risk so I'm just just to make myself clear um I am gonna
3783880	3789120	have six six panels at Dragon Con it looks like so three on the gaming track and three on the
3789120	3793120	digital media track I will break that all down for you when we get closer to the convention but
3793120	3797400	I'm very excited about it I just found out what panels I'm I don't believe anything until it's in
3797400	3801360	the app so what panels I'm supposedly doing on the gaming track and there's some really exciting
3801360	3806720	ones because I have some stuff that's about like community stuff this year so I'm really excited
3806720	3815160	about that there's that'll be cool and then I also want to mention the southern fried game room Expo
3815160	3820200	also in the Atlanta area where Bobby Black Wolf is based we are sponsoring the southern fried
3820200	3824440	gaming expo which is coming up in mid-august so if you are in the Atlanta area I would encourage
3824480	3830920	you to check out that as well they are taking precautions for kovin spacing games out a little
3830920	3835080	more and they usually do and things like that so you know if you feel so I'm not that's why I'm
3835080	3839680	also like you must come to dragon caught no if you if you're not feeling it then don't it's fine
3839680	3845240	I understand everybody's got their own comfort level yeah I got you but next year hopefully we
3845240	3850040	can have that conversation that would be great actually next year probably not because I've got
3850120	3858440	derpy con it's the same weekend no but I have to management I'm off sure you have to pick yeah I
3858440	3864200	get it I get it yeah because the other thing is that I'm actually hope hopefully gonna try twitch
3864200	3870200	con next year I'd love to do twitch con again yeah I hope that does come back I hope I hope
3870200	3874720	everything's safe for that to come back you know speaking on they go to yeah I've been into a
3874720	3880480	convention and actually I I went to a gaming convention locally here not that long ago but
3880480	3886800	I haven't been to an actual convention a bigger convention for I don't even know I'm ears probably
3886800	3902680	when we all went to Pax Oh eight maybe my last con was drag con in 2019 my last yeah mine would
3902680	3909400	have been again Kanye my last nerd like gaming whatever convention would have been gamer X
3909400	3916320	ah the Star Trek I am never going to drag con again by the way unless they fix a lot of their
3916320	3923440	bullshit um Oh magfest I wanted to bring up to because I heard the dates for that came out and
3923440	3929400	people been asking me about that I don't have a hotel so it's not in the cards right now for me
3929400	3935080	to go could I try to work something out and go maybe but I kind of feel like I I think I'm only
3935080	3939760	gonna spend that kind of money to go out to magfest if I can somehow be involved with the
3939760	3945520	con like doing panels or something that is in my skill set I think that's the only way I would I
3945520	3951880	would consider it but I am not faced with some of the same challenges I used to have I didn't go to
3951880	3957880	magfest for years because I couldn't swing the time off with work I am at a different place now
3957880	3962880	and I'm in a different role where I and because of the pandemic I've saved up a lot of time off
3962880	3969120	so yeah that is not my challenge anymore but money and those types of things are playing into it so
3969120	3972880	there's that it yeah I don't know if you're probably in the same boat but I'm hitting hit
3972880	3979040	my cap on vacation hours I have to keep taking time off because otherwise I lose that time being
3979040	3983920	earned yeah yeah it's just um as far as like traveling out and spending that kind of money
3983920	3988120	to go out to conventions at this point I really only want to do that for conventions that I'm
3988120	3992680	gonna have some sort of involvement in like that's and I think I think it's my money I can choose to
3992680	3998840	draw the line there I will do more local drivable things in this area and that drivable is a lot I
3998840	4004600	could I could drive to Portland I could drive to I could probably drive to Vegas I could drive to
4004600	4009640	LA like that's all kind of in my driving range so I'm open to those types of conventions just like
4009640	4016200	as a you know fan attendee sort of basis but yeah I I probably will not be traveling to conventions
4016200	4023920	a lot unless I'm involved with them um all right let's see let's move on we want to get into some
4023920	4029360	news so let's start with Loki and our gaming news this week I mean this is not a big surprise
4029360	4035680	obviously we're not expecting Nintendo to announce a you know switch I mean some people are expecting
4035840	4045680	a brand new switch Pro or something like that but just to you know I guess reinforce the fact that
4045680	4049960	listen they're not announcing anything they're basically saying right now at this time there's
4049960	4056000	no other switch model coming well I guess there's maybe firmly saying that there's no other model
4056000	4061840	coming at this time other than the switch OLED model that's it they're not gonna be announcing
4061840	4070040	anything which I mean obviously they're not gonna say well we've got an announcement coming but we
4070040	4074520	can't tell you about it like obviously they're gonna play dumb until they finally announce
4074520	4080160	whatever they're gonna announce when they want to announce it so it's not I'm not surprised that
4080160	4084920	they're affirming this but basically they said that listen other than the switch OLED that's
4084920	4092200	gonna be coming in October this year we've got no switch Pro to announce which obviously makes
4092200	4097040	sense with the hardware shortages or the chip shortages and all that stuff but they just wanted
4097040	4102560	to let you know stop speculating you know they'll tell you when they have something to tell you
4102560	4109240	uh yeah I I wonder if this means that the switch Pro is kind of like not a thing and now we'll be
4109240	4114040	talking about a successor to the switch at this point I mean probably at that point like whatever
4114040	4118040	they decide to do that and who knows how long this hardware shortage or chip shortage is gonna
4118040	4123560	go so by that time it could be another system there's also that part of me that's very skeptical
4123560	4128000	because I'm like well Nintendo has to say this or they're not gonna sell OLED switches you know they
4128000	4133280	can't yeah they can't say well we got something else coming soon but you should drop 350 bucks
4133280	4138600	on this first you know they can't really do that so you know I do take some of this with a grain
4138600	4144440	of salt but I think it is very likely due to the chip shortages due to you know the nature of the
4144440	4149480	world and all this stuff that maybe there just isn't gonna be a switch Pro that this that all
4149480	4155840	gets looped into the switch's successor maybe we get the switch's successor earlier than planned
4155840	4160560	because the switch Pro is not going to be there to extend the life or whatever but I kind of think
4160560	4166600	that's where this ends up at this point yeah I mean it was just like the OLED stuff I mean they
4166680	4170360	they're not gonna announce it until they're ready to announce it even if it's something that's being
4170360	4177120	in the works and I mean I don't know they're probably gonna try to wait until some big game
4177120	4183520	that they can kind of tie it with yeah so you know Breath of the Wild 2 or you know Metroid Prime 4
4183520	4188560	or something like that I mean it's gonna be something like that and who knows who knows
4188560	4192640	that Breath of the Wild 2 gets delayed I mean we don't know we've only seen like a couple trailers
4192640	4199280	so it it very well could be an announcement that they make around that time whatever that happens
4199280	4204160	you know closer to when those games are releasing so it's just you got to understand you're playing
4204160	4209080	by Nintendo's rules yeah you're just gonna have to wait okay unless you know someone hacks their
4209080	4213040	emails again and all that information leaks out but like until until that happens you know you're
4213040	4218280	just gonna have to wait be patient or in triad suggests Mario Odyssey 2 that would be a good one
4218280	4227360	how about Luigi's Odyssey how about Waluigi's Odyssey when surprise like after all of the
4227360	4232960	complaining and whining about that stuff that Waluigi never made it into Smash Bros oh they
4232960	4236840	haven't announced the last character yet there's one more they already did no there's one more
4236840	4242640	character to go it's gonna be another Dragon Quest character or something still they're gonna fit
4242640	4248200	another was it Fire Emblem character in there it's gonna be another one they're just gonna
4248760	4254320	in there I feel it's it's so interesting because like most of the like internet rabble are like
4254320	4260520	things way out there like you know Master Chief gets added to the game or thing and then it's
4260520	4271200	like it's that or it's Waluigi Waluigi as doom guy all right I'll do Weegee yeah let's talk about
4271200	4277960	Final Fantasy 14 this is a game I play way too much of and it's going through some changes they
4277960	4284040	are getting a huge influx of people in Final Fantasy 14 which is weird because they're not
4284040	4290000	it's just existing right now there's a they're actually in the pre-expansion lol and Walker
4290000	4295640	doesn't come out until what November so there's there's like nothing big going on in Final Fantasy
4295640	4301440	14 now but there's a variety of things going on and and I don't even like a lot of people go oh
4301440	4307800	the Wow patch you know made everybody jump ship I'm not even sure it's just that like that may
4307800	4311400	have been the marble that starts the avalanche sort of thing but I feel like there's a lot of
4311400	4315160	other factors where people maybe the pandemic plays into this too I don't but this is like
4315160	4318800	all these people are signing into Final Fantasy 14 now and look I've been playing the game ever
4318800	4324520	since alpha so I fuck I survived 1.0 okay that's how long I've been playing obviously for you I
4324520	4330560	should have a shirt I survived 1.0 um and it's it's it's a great game welcome glad y'all could
4330560	4337800	make it but it's it's interesting that it's going through all this right now and now Kiyoshita who's
4337800	4342000	the producer director of the game actually wrote this very interesting kind of like blog post about
4342000	4346640	the thing one thing he didn't say this in the blog post be said it in an interview he actually
4346640	4352080	called out and said you know don't come I'm paraphrasing because I don't have the exact
4352080	4357600	quote in front of me but it's basically like don't shit on Wow to raise up Final Fantasy 14
4357640	4365080	because a lot of what's in this game the influence comes from Wow I thought that was very polite of
4365080	4370360	him to do like he didn't have to say that but he did and I thought that was very very nice and
4370360	4379440	polite but I also think the way that the developers of this game connect with their community they're
4379440	4387160	doing a fantastic job of that that I don't think Wow or any other game in its current form really
4387200	4393280	comes close to what they're doing over at Square Enix and creative unit 3 so just my thoughts
4393280	4400400	there on that but anyhow um now Kiyoshita said the game is so popular that players in North America
4400400	4404440	and Europe are having problems getting in making characters on the servers they want because a
4404440	4409320	server congestion so he spelled out here are the plans here's the things we're gonna do to fix this
4409320	4413920	here's what we're doing you know we're gonna be boosting some things here but it's not just as
4413920	4418000	easy as like upping a switch sometimes so one other thing they did they actually put out a
4418000	4424680	patch that will boot characters from the game for being idle so if you are sitting there idle for
4424680	4430080	30 minutes you will be booted from the game this is interesting because it caused a response of
4430080	4436040	people to basically like you know oh but I like just sitting there and seeing the world of 14
4436040	4440280	sometimes and I like some of the shit that goes on if all fancy 14 that really has nothing to do
4440280	4444920	with the game like the the people that will be dancing in certain areas of the bards that will
4444920	4449760	be singing certain songs and stuff like people are into that so is it now you should have put
4449760	4455320	out another statement that was basically like that's not I didn't say you had to log out and
4455320	4460840	stop doing those things we love that you do those things continue to do those things it's just we
4460840	4464640	need some precautionary measures because of what the game is going through right now so if you're
4464640	4468600	like doing literally nothing you're gonna get logged out after 30 minutes but don't feel like
4468760	4474040	you have to log out because you're not actively playing the game if that makes sense I thought
4474040	4478680	this is very interesting that he had to put out two statements don't people understand like servers
4478680	4484320	I mean like seriously if you have like so many players on the server like you can't just idle
4484320	4489040	there like people are trying to get in or like even the very least it's gonna be server latency
4489040	4493640	like I get it that you like you enjoy the world that's cool you know what other people might like
4493640	4497880	to enjoy the world as well and with all you people just sitting around that might make it pretty
4497880	4502720	taxing and hard for people to actually be able to log in and enjoy that same world with you it's
4502720	4507720	like come on other people there than yourself you can also enjoy the world by you know walking
4507720	4513160	around in it exactly how many enjoy more than just the world that's right around your character
4513160	4518400	how about yeah you walk around a little bit take a walk you know and I see the side only stop like
4518400	4524520	if I had to go to the bathroom or really wanted to listen to the old music which was really it
4524560	4529240	oh I like the old music I'm gonna listen to it for a while oops I'm lost well that's why they did 30
4529240	4533960	minutes 30 minutes is not unreasonable anyways I don't know if I see I don't play Final Fantasy
4533960	4537480	14 so I don't know if there's anything that like you can afk to farm something or something like
4537480	4543800	that but like that's not unreasonable like 30 minutes that's that's more than enough time to
4543800	4548720	like if you want to go grab a meal or something like that and come back but like even then like
4548720	4554080	log out or something like you can do a lot of pooping in 30 minutes you shouldn't need to be
4554440	4560200	that long yeah and with the right with the right hardware like the steam you know like maybe that
4560200	4564240	steam console or something like that you might not even need the log out they'll do the pooping I
4564240	4569840	mean you can just take it with you but like it's still it's not unreasonable like I don't understand
4569840	4574040	why people would be getting upset about that like it's like listen we could have made it much
4574040	4580320	shorter like 30 minutes is I think that's more than fair yeah I think so too it's but the
4580360	4586680	expectations for the next expansion boy oh boy I I'm I'm worried that the next expansion like if
4586680	4592120	they're having these problems now you know like an interesting thing about it Square Enix didn't
4592120	4597640	project this they couldn't like they they couldn't know that this was gonna happen that it's getting
4597640	4603320	this popular just like what seemingly out of the blue so it's it's they've got to be in panic mode
4603320	4610000	about this expansion I got it boy oh boy but they'll figure it out they always do all right
4610000	4617120	um let's see hey Tay plays games and chat says don't go on tick-tock while pooping 30 minutes
4617120	4623160	will fly by yeah be careful about these uh you're taking the switch and the the steam deck and all
4623160	4630560	that stuff anyway all right let's move on get into start calling it taking a steaming deck you know
4630560	4639960	dark Sakura quick change the topic dark soccer you're muted just you know a hard meet on discord
4639960	4651520	I know cuz I was eating oak and now I'm not I want more of the delicious meat product Dan slow
4651520	4658520	cooked Dan actually uh we have a smoker he spoke to try tip oh yum I'm coming over okay
4659400	4669600	slices left in their mind anyway back to the Olympics you know we've had a lot of video
4669600	4677960	games come from the Olympics we've you know like so much has been inspired by it and in you know
4677960	4687400	in the world of gaming but when have we ever had video game music played in the Olympics
4687920	4699160	so the opening ceremonies on Friday began with certain video game songs there was a
4699160	4707560	Sonic the Hedgehog used in there the main Final Fantasy theme it's it's pretty awesome you know
4707560	4715600	of course you know the gaming industry is is really you know a big part of the Japanese
4715600	4723040	economy and it would make sense that they would pay tribute to that I think in the opening
4723040	4729520	ceremonies I think that's really awesome and a good thing about video game music and I like
4729520	4736360	this point that was was made about it is that it's not like it's pop music you know where it's just
4736360	4741320	you know it's there to be a good bop to listen to it you know but it's there to play in with
4741320	4748040	your experience with the game that you're playing and in that case it works very well
4748040	4754960	I would say within opening ceremony program hmm I didn't see the opening ceremonies admittedly I
4754960	4759360	just you know that's that's a large commitment of time but I'm glad that the the talents of
4759360	4764040	video game music composers are being shown on the main stage like that even though I know it's a
4764040	4767640	weird Olympics this year like there's a lot of people that are like why are the Olympics
4767640	4770840	happening there's a lot of people in Japan the host nation they're like why are the Olympics
4770880	4776840	happening right now but it is what it is it's on the world stage for folks to hear oh there's some
4776840	4783840	other things on here like the first notes of the Olympics were from born a new which is the first
4783840	4793800	movement of the final fight a Final Fantasy 13 hmm but I mean not everyone is gonna know it that
4793800	4804400	well but I mean there was also stuff from Monster Hunter Kingdom Hearts near replicant some India
4804400	4811400	walked out to frogs theme from Chrono Trigger that's good music I mean it's really like triumphant
4811400	4817760	music I just think that it's absolutely awesome you know and it'll be definitely worth a watch
4817760	4821480	we'll have to see what happens at the closing ceremonies cuz they'll probably be some stuff
4821480	4827440	there too so keep an eye on that darted darted suya says I thought it was all really cool the
4827440	4831960	most surprising one to me was not just Gradius but the weapon select menu music from Gradius
4831960	4838560	too that's pretty cool oh yeah SSG 100 Matt says I wonder if a figure skater used gaming music at
4838560	4843280	some point that's where my brain yeah I was like there had to have been a figure skater that's used
4843280	4851280	that type of music for sure there there's actually a professional figure skater meaning
4851560	4858840	non-competitive who did like a whole Sailor Moon thing and change I mean it's not oh I've seen
4858840	4869240	that yeah yeah yeah I yeah yeah um there were there's also gymnasts who have used video game
4869240	4877680	music as part of their floor exercise yeah that's yeah all right um and DJ Romas says there was also
4877800	4883200	a song played during the opening ceremonies that was a nod to Digimon adventures Bolero de Ravel
4883200	4890000	I love Digimon. I love Japanese Digimon. Yeah and SSG 100 Matt talking about figure skating says I
4890000	4893520	feel like someone used the halo theme I think you're right I think that was I remember that
4893520	4901880	being a thing yeah yeah so pretty neat all right um let's move on Loki all right so going back to
4901880	4909080	Nintendo apparently you know with the the death of the Wii U and 3ds they are now gonna be
4909080	4918160	suspending the use of credit cards on the Japanese 3ds and Wii U e-shops starting January 18 2022 I
4918160	4923760	could have sworn those e-shops are already down but apparently not yet but they're gonna be
4923760	4930280	discontinuing the use of cards on there apparently all other aspects of the 3ds and Wii U shops will
4930280	4935480	remain functional so you can still buy games and download already purchased titles but payments
4935480	4943120	can be done through like e-shop cards and stuff like that that's not really a big surprise I
4943120	4948880	seriously thought this is already taken care of and then along with that though they're saying
4948880	4953920	that the ending there is a rumor that the they're gonna stop taking submissions for new 3ds and Wii
4953920	4960200	U e-shop games as of April 2022 so kind of similar to what happened with some of these other you
4960200	4965320	know marketplaces where they kind of discontinue them and you can't put games out on there so that
4965320	4973320	may be happening April 1st which would be I guess that the end of this fiscal year so interesting
4973320	4978760	we'll we'll see if that actually happens but once again already thought this happened so this is
4978760	4987680	kind of like news but like really it hasn't happened yet yeah but then of course it also
4987680	4992280	leads to that discussion about like you know that what happens when these stores go down then it's
4992280	4996960	like this especially we're talking about the Wii U which still has some virtual console stuff that
4996960	5002600	the switch doesn't have right like it doesn't have a lot of virtual yeah like earthbound and
5002600	5007480	earthbound zero are kind of the big ones that think Super Mario RPG was on there too wasn't
5007600	5013920	it I might be wrong but there's a lot of stuff that you know still is an RPG it's an RPG though
5013920	5021120	on the switch though Super Mario RPG no yeah no sure yes that's the one everybody thought it was
5021120	5026520	wait me oh you know I think I'm no you're right you're right I'm thinking of the the classic
5026520	5032520	system that has Super Mario RPG yes yes the classic system did you're right I got them
5032520	5037920	confused no worries so why isn't that on there yet I mean come on they've already licensed it
5037920	5041800	for the classic system you and every other Nintendo fan on Twitter once the answer to
5041800	5046840	that question they're not selling those anymore I mean like why not like I don't understand what
5046840	5053320	the holdup is yeah I don't know either all right and I don't know why they won't put this game on
5053320	5059320	more than just mobile phones I'm talking of course about the Final Fantasy pixel remaster although
5059320	5065480	there are some some waves some things this week making us think maybe it could come to other
5065480	5069000	platforms because you know speaking of the switch I think there's a lot of people that would like to
5069000	5074120	see the Final Fantasy pixel remaster on the switch at least if not you know some other places it is
5074120	5078320	coming to steam as well though I should say so you know there's always a steam deck if nothing else
5078320	5087080	and all those other you know magical things that they have there so I'm having a problem getting
5087200	5092760	this story live whoops there we go okay there was a Japanese Q&A where Square Enix actually talked a
5092760	5097480	little bit about Final Fantasy 1 through 6 and they were talking about that they wanted to renew
5097480	5103360	the games with the same standard but make it better for first-time players and folks that
5103360	5108600	are returning to the series as well right it's kind of the stuff you would expect them to say
5108600	5114880	it was also mentioned that Kazuko Shibuya who worked on numerous Final Fantasy games is
5114960	5120720	recreating the character art for the remasters that's an important point it wasn't like outsourced
5120720	5125880	or sent to you know people that aren't involved with Final Fantasy or what have you like the other
5125880	5131800	remasters apparently were so the ones that they're gonna be actually pulling Nobuo Imatsu is
5131800	5140240	supervising the music and rearrangements so that's nice too I hope that all turns out well and these
5140280	5147720	remasters are being released on July 28th whereas 4 through 6 are coming soon we don't know exactly
5147720	5154920	when those will be happening so there is that yeah but if there's enough demand they might
5154920	5164400	actually make that for other consoles as well consider me demanding it Dr. Suya says I mean I
5164400	5168800	hope it does but like did Squeenix not see the reaction to their announcement and how it wasn't
5168960	5175440	announced for consoles like at all oh I'm sure they saw it and maybe that's why we're starting
5175440	5181200	to hear some of the cracks there about well it might happen maybe as Suya and her to Matt saying
5181200	5186560	they're saying be prepared to pay for it twice but if they put it on other platforms I'll buy
5186560	5192160	Final Fantasy 5 pixel remaster twice yeah I think there's a lot of us that would have no I mean if
5192160	5196360	you are gonna buy any of these you're probably buying the game for the second third maybe fourth
5196440	5202520	time a game like Final Fantasy has a cartridge yeah a game like Final Fantasy 6 shit I don't
5202520	5206400	want to think about how many times I probably bought that game I do have the cartridge and
5206400	5211080	I'll buy the remaster when it's not on mobile when it when it's on the switch or you know
5211080	5220840	somewhere I want to play it moving on dark soccer well while we've been in quarantine at various
5220840	5227760	levels there has been a company that has seen an increase in their business and that's Peloton you
5227760	5234280	know with their little like on-screen coaches and whatnot now they want to enter video games
5234280	5239240	our pal melody is obsessed with that thing and keeps trying to get me to get one and I'm like
5239240	5247600	I'm not supporting them oh oh I'd like to hear more on that all right there are it's a more of
5247720	5255440	they don't know the right audience thing so okay but anyway there want to bring in like an in-app
5255440	5262600	video game that is currently called lane break it could be subject to change it's in beta testing
5262600	5268440	right now actually it will be in beta testing later this year and they want it to launch in
5268440	5274440	early 2022 you can listen to the music that you want to hear in the game and choose your difficulty
5274440	5284600	level and win points and it's considered they say a music-based experience so basically as it
5284600	5288040	goes through is that you have to change your cadence and resistance levels to meet these
5288040	5294000	different goals and everything I you can control your avatar and move them on the racetrack it
5294000	5303640	looks like it's some kind of racing or marathoning kind of game but I don't know that there's also
5303840	5310960	another note on there that they're also thinking of going into the wearables market with like a
5310960	5317520	digital heart rate armband and stuff like that I don't know they their stock fell like 22% last
5317520	5328160	year but they were up 7% um you know last week so who knows I'll be curious to see how they kind of
5328160	5331600	maintain that because like now that people are going back to the gym and stuff how that kind of
5332160	5341200	sustains my work gym again oh well yeah yeah cuz now a lot of things seem to be regressing a little
5341200	5346480	bit so could be could be that the big gyms end up closing too but we'll see we'll see I kind of
5346480	5350120	don't think they will I don't think I don't think they're gonna close businesses again I just I don't
5350120	5357320	have I don't have room for this shit in my house need for this shit I own a bicycle I just have to
5357320	5363680	get the tires fixed on it yeah my bicycle is really adorable and awesome I have gym equipment
5363680	5372560	in my front room you don't need to have a gym membership or buy expensive items like this to
5372560	5379360	to get a health benefit and if you've got you know I've still got your ring fit don't I mm-hmm
5379360	5385680	mm-hmm I'll actually play it someday remember I injured my back though so I had to quit all of my
5385720	5391200	workouts you've seen those at the store and I'm like maybe I'm waiting for a sale I think I'm
5391200	5398160	just gonna get one yeah all right still have lots of those gaming watches I've been every time I go
5398160	5402360	to Target I always check to see if they have them left and there's still a bunch of them left they're
5402360	5409680	down the $49.99 so way too much I'll wait for another price cut find me a shell plushie because
5409680	5415560	I got my Octorock in the background I need a blue shell to go with him so I can throw it at Dan
5416120	5426640	alright Loki what else do we have so they did a brief EA play presentation this week which no I
5426640	5431560	don't think is like kind of like their equivalent of like their e3 type coverage but it was a few
5431560	5438960	announcements so the big one obviously is the tease of the remake of Dead Space which looks
5438960	5446400	pretty cool some other neat things battlefield 2042 is gonna have a brand new mode called portal
5446400	5453040	which is going to allow folks to create like really custom match types and so everything
5453040	5460120	from like literally bringing in soldiers and stuff from other games from other battlefield
5460120	5464800	games so you can do like World War two versus like future tech stuff and all sorts of crazy
5464960	5471200	different combinations of things so that looks pretty fun and allow people to actually script
5471200	5476160	different things they're gonna have like visual scripting in there as well to create these custom
5476160	5482720	matches so that that sounds interesting very intriguing along with that though there's also
5482720	5493040	this brand new indie game that they were showing off called it was the was it something of random
5493040	5497760	lost in random which looked pretty awesome kind of like almost like a Tim Burton-esque
5497760	5502720	type game so that's going to be coming as well from the developers of Fae and that's out in
5502720	5507280	September and then last but not least they also showed off grid legends which is pretty cool and
5508000	5515360	even has like live action sections in as well for their single player campaign that said though that
5516560	5521840	I understand it's a different company but like I still have a bad taste of the mouth from
5521840	5526320	the live action stuff from the lat what was it one of the need for speed games that they had
5526320	5531680	oh yeah it was just it was it was ultimate cringe it was kind of like hey look we're
5531680	5536800	trying to be fast and the furious and it was just like and this was kind of like
5538640	5544240	still cringy but not the same but like I don't know but I'm sure it's a solid racing game you
5544240	5550640	know maybe there's a skip past the cutscene stuff that would be nice but yeah it lots of
5550640	5555920	neat things coming out yeah it's hard to think about other racing games when we know there's
5555920	5562480	a new Forza Horizon coming this year but yeah why not there's room for everybody let's just say that
5562480	5566560	all right plus if you like Battlefield games or at least to kind of get a little bit interested
5566560	5572320	in Battlefield 24 2 they're actually partnering right now with Amazon for like some Amazon game
5572320	5577760	stuff where they're giving away like Battlefield 1 like right now I know through Twitch they're
5577760	5583520	doing that if you have Prime so Battlefield 1 is available now and then they're also going to be
5583520	5590960	I think doing Battlefield 5 is also going to be available soon as well so check on those if you
5590960	5598000	your notifications on Twitch and see if you have that all right well let's move on to another
5598640	5603200	console that we haven't really I know we've brought it up before we haven't talked a lot
5603200	5608800	about it but there is a new console on its way and it's called the playdate I don't know if you
5608800	5613440	know this one but you probably if you see it you know because it has the little crank that's kind
5613440	5617600	of what makes it unique it's a it's a video game system that you can crank it's a portable game
5617600	5623280	system we just so you can play it during the middle of a disaster yeah well I don't think
5623280	5630480	it's powered by the crank no the crank is just one extra way to uh play play the game it's an
5630480	5634880	extra type of controller ridiculous I you know I know some people that are like I feel like this
5634880	5638880	thing is going to have a bit of a cult following because I know some people that are like super
5638880	5645920	into this and I think the fact that it is very fiercely indie is very appealing to some people
5646480	5653600	this doesn't have you know um the the Nintendo the Playstation the Microsoft or whatever behind it
5653600	5658720	and people are actually like super into that uh that it's a fiercely indie thing but we did find
5658720	5663040	out we uh some more info about the console and that is that you're going to be able to pre-order
5663040	5669120	them uh starting this week on the 29th 1 p.m eastern 10 a.m pacific the pre-orders go up it
5669120	5675280	will be 179 dollars if you want to get a purple protective cover for the handheld that will be 29
5675280	5680400	dollars uh and if you want to get the bundle that's just shy of 200 there's also going to be
5680400	5684480	a stereo dock but that isn't ready for pre-orders yet that's just something they're working on in
5684480	5689520	the future they're going to make around 20 000 of these that will ship by the end of the year
5689520	5695280	and then subsequent orders will start in 2022 they are also reassuring that the play date will
5695280	5701040	not sell out you will just have to wait in line so you may not get yours until 2022 you will have
5701040	5705760	to pay for this up front but panic does the company behind it says that you can cancel this
5705760	5711600	at any time it is limited to certain countries so if you're not in like the us canada you know
5711600	5716560	australia you might want to look into is this available in your country uh sorry mike deft
5716560	5720080	i'm already looking and mexico doesn't appear to be on the list i'm sorry but maybe in the near
5720080	5728240	future um so yeah as if all that wasn't enough uh the company behind the playdate panic will be doing
5728240	5733920	a podcast an official podcast starting next week that is going to give more information about the
5733920	5739920	console so i i like there was something where like the crank involved time so you could move time
5740000	5743840	forward or backward and that was kind of like the the puzzle game with it i thought that was yeah
5743840	5750480	that was one game it's a very nintendo-y thing it's a very nintendo-y thing to be like we have
5750480	5756800	this idea on how games should be played and now we want these games to involve it it's all black
5756800	5765280	and white too it's yeah yeah it's very uh throwback in that way so uh dgerama s though is asking where
5765280	5771760	is the kf's console remember that the kfc uh console that was i think they released that
5771760	5777920	and let's be real it's it's not a console it's just a fucking pc in a it's a easy case with
5777920	5783120	where the case has a piece cut out where you can put chicken because computers get hot that's
5783120	5789360	it's it's a brilliant marketing thing and that's it like the kfc computer console thing it's not
5789360	5794800	going to cook your chicken it's not going to make your home chicken taste like kfc uh just you know
5794880	5800240	it's it's a meme that's gone out of control that is what the kf console is at this point
5800240	5802800	it is a meme that's gone out of control all right
5805520	5809680	let's travel back to a simpler time when we didn't we didn't even know
5809680	5812800	what memes were they were meemies with our next segment
5812800	5829600	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault
5829600	5835040	and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
5836240	5839680	and a very uh theme appropriate pick this week dark soccer what did you pick
5842880	5848400	and we're not hearing dark soccer i don't know if the mute button is coming into play again it is
5848400	5855600	because i was eating meat that's all right um so the game i have chosen i will use the japanese
5855600	5863200	name first hyper olympic also known in the us as track and field um it is an olympic themed
5863200	5870720	sports game it was developed by konami and released in 1983 for arcades um and the uh japanese
5870720	5878560	one actually did legitimately have an official license for the 1984 summer olympics um in europe
5878560	5884000	the game was originally released as a hyper olympic and then was re-released under the u.s
5884000	5898320	title uh track and field in 1984 so um the game is uh it's very simple you have uh two run buttons
5899120	5903440	later unit units had a trackball because the buttons would just break from overuse and an
5903440	5911600	action button um and you had uh a few different events six events you had a hundred meter dash
5912240	5919520	you had a long jump you had a javelin throw uh 110 meter hurdles the hammer throw
5920400	5930240	please hammer don't hurt him and the high jump um in each event you have to qualify if you uh
5930800	5938720	don't qualify then you lose a life um and then your game will end when you're out um you can
5938720	5947120	earn extra lives per every uh hundred thousand points that you uh score um the game can uh
5947120	5952160	take up to four players um who would compete in pairs um if there are fewer
5952160	5960720	than four then the remaining ones are played by the computer um and uh it's it's just it
5960720	5965920	was a very interesting game when it came out and there's a little bit more like behind this um
5966720	5974720	there were also some uh different tricks um because of how the game responds to the
5974720	5980240	run button being pressed at a high frequency um when you played in the arcade there were
5980240	5985520	different tricks like rapidly uh swiping a coin or a ping pong ball over the buttons
5985520	5989920	or using a metal ruler which was repeatedly struck so that it would vibrate on the buttons
5989920	5995280	and so there were lots of damage to the buttons and then they had to modify them so that it
5995280	6001600	wouldn't make people wouldn't do that so um when hyper olympic was introduced it was at the
6001600	6008000	tokyo music machine uh tokyo's amusement machine show i can say words i promise
6008640	6016400	um in september 1983 now this was at the time the big trend was laserdisc games
6019040	6026880	and the thing is that this particular game beat out all the big laserdisc games that were were out
6026880	6033520	as probably one of the the top ones of the games uh top one of the of the series um there were
6033520	6039120	comparisons drawn to activision decathlon that it came out the month earlier um but
6040000	6050240	that didn't stop it from being popular um for the u.s um it actually was licensed to centuri
6050240	6058560	for north american distribution but um since atari had been chosen as the official olympic
6058560	6065440	sponsor they couldn't keep the name hyper olympics so they changed it to track and field and so this
6065440	6072240	was introduced at the amusement and amusement and music operators association show the amoa
6072880	6079440	in october 1983 and again laserdisc games were really the big thing there but it ended up
6079440	6084880	uh pretty much taking the show um lots of people really enjoyed it and thought it was the best
6084880	6095600	thing there so as for um various ports um konami licensed the north american home version to atari
6096560	6104640	um they uh initially ported it to the atari 2600 and 8-bit computers and then um there
6104640	6113120	were versions for apple 2 and commodore 64 under atari soft there's a port for the atari 5200 that
6113120	6119840	was uh supposed to come out but it was cancelled um and it was pretty much just like the 8-bit
6119840	6126240	version um and it was the 2600 version was one of the first games to use atari super chip technology
6126800	6132960	that enhanced the graphics and gameplay to better than what was previously available
6133680	6140800	um konami ported track and field as hyper olympic to the famicom and it only had four of the events
6140800	6150880	um and then they also converted hyper sports to famicom um which had uh three hyper sports
6150880	6159280	events and one event from uh from hyper olympics um and then konami retooled the game to be ported
6159280	6166000	in america by including all eight events in the cartridge so what we have is track and field on
6166000	6174560	ness um has uh certain games from hyper track or some stages from hyper track and from hyper
6174560	6182880	olympic um we have the original six from uh from hyper olympic except the hammer throw is missing
6182880	6189440	in its place they have added skeet shooting archery and a triple jump there uh were zx
6189440	6194400	spectrum and amstrad cpc version but they were released as part of the game set match 2 compilation
6194400	6203200	in 1988 and of course hated it they weren't really considered all that great um the nest version of
6203200	6210960	track and field was re-released in europe in 1992 is track and field in barcelona by chemco uh for
6210960	6217840	the 1992 summer olympics um the opening song for the nest version uh was chariots of fire
6218400	6225920	and it was also used in the arcade versions uh a high screen a high score screen as for its
6225920	6233360	reception um in japan game machine magazine listed track and field as their december 1983
6233360	6239840	uh issued the most successful new arcade unit of the month it topped japan's table arcade cabinet
6239840	6248400	charts in january 1984 the game sold 38 000 units in japan by the end of 1983 um it was a big hit in
6248400	6257920	the us as well it topped uh upright cabinet charts in 1980 in february 1984 may 1984 became one of
6257920	6263600	the highest grossing one of the top five highest grossing arcade machines in 1984 in europe it was
6263600	6275360	the highest uh grossing arcade game in 1984 uh actually in the uk um in 1984 um it was uh one of
6275360	6280880	the cautions about it is that it's a great game but you'll cramp your finger for the home versions
6281600	6289200	um it's also was uh listed as one of the top 100 games of all time in the 1996 issue of next
6289200	6297840	generation um as for its impact um it wasn't the first olympic game uh that came out it was
6297840	6307040	preceded by olympic decathlon in 1980 and then activisions decathlon in august 1983 but um it
6307040	6314000	spawned a lot of other olympic video games afterwards ocean software uh took that format and
6314000	6322480	used in daily thompson's decathlon uh 1984 epics um released a multi-event collection called summer
6322480	6329760	games and then summers summer games 2 dynamic um there was a video olympic for the zx spectrum in
6329760	6339280	1984 stadium events for the nest in 1986 um and then sports games became more popular after track
6339280	6347920	and field's release um they actually hadn't had too many since the days of pong uh maybe a few
6348640	6357920	um and one other interesting thing uh kishimoto uh yoshino uh yoshihiro of uh namco stated that
6357920	6364560	track and field was the biggest influence on the side scrolling game packland in 1984 a lot
6364560	6369760	of the controls were heavily influenced by track and field um and it let you become faster by
6369760	6374240	tapping the buttons in succession he thought the idea was interesting and would make packland stand
6374240	6382800	out um so as far as other re-releases um well actually there have been a lot of sequels there
6382800	6390720	was hyper sports track and field 2 hyper olympic 2 for the msx konami 88 in the arcade track and
6390720	6395520	field 2 for nest track and field for gameboy international track and field i'm just gonna
6395520	6401760	name names uh nagano winter olympics 98 um n64 playstation arcade uh international track and
6401760	6406960	field 2000 espn international track and field konami sports series for mobile phones new
6406960	6416000	international track and field for uh the ds uh hypersports winter for uh for ios um hyper
6416000	6423200	sports track and field also for uh ios um and then there were re-releases in the form of konami
6423200	6429760	classic series arcade hits for the ds um it had to alter the chariot sapphire theme for licensing
6430480	6436000	um it was part of the konami gameboy collection series xbox live arcade had a version that was
6436000	6442960	released on xbox 260 august 8th 20 uh 2007 with updated graphics audio leaderboard online play

6454240	6462080	originally set december 18 2008 by hector rodriguez um with a score of 95 350 points
6462720	6471040	and he beat out the previous record of 95 040 points which was a 23 year old record set on june
6471040	6480000	30th 1985 by kelly kobashigawa of new york um for the twin galaxy's 1985 video game masters
6480000	6492960	tournament um and the other now this is interesting to me um there uh for the uh 1984 march of dimes
6492960	6498800	international konami slash centurion track and field challenge um this was held at aladdin's
6498800	6505680	castle guess who's first well actually second arcade gig was at an aladdin's castle this bitch
6507600	6513600	um so there we go uh so our game is hyper olympic slash track and field
6514640	6521040	all right and this is one uh i remember playing but uh it it hurts like the buttons and smashing
6521040	6525120	them as much as you had to in this game it was it was a talent i think to do that
6525120	6532960	so all right there it is your classic game oh so answer dart tutsia yes i believe that pyramid
6532960	6538080	head was in the ds1 i do remember that because i think that was the thing we talked about on
6538080	6543040	the show years ago yeah yeah because i remember it was like what the hell does he do in the
6543760	6549280	in the track and field game but who cares it's funny all right there it is i mean he does get
6549280	6554480	around he's in dead by daylight he's in other silent hill games that have nothing to do with
6554480	6559120	the mythology he appeared because he was supposed to be james cinderland's like interest in
6559120	6566320	punishing himself yeah go fig um and wasn't he also in like one of the konami racing games
6567440	6575680	uh probably yeah yeah hey that p-hitty gets around uh-huh all right uh let's uh go around
6575680	6580720	the world quickly and uh check out some rapid fire news some other headlines uh in the gaming
6580720	6590560	industry loki yeah so um apparently we're getting vendetta as part of the arcade archives uh so
6590560	6598400	that's the old uh konami i guess it's like a beat-em-up type game interesting um so that'll
6598400	6605040	be coming out soon and then uh it's uh yeah on playstation 4 and into the switch eight dollars
6605040	6619040	it looks like and then this is i i konami you gotta let frogger go stop pushing frogger but
6619040	6624800	apparently there is a frogger tv show coming that i completely forgot about i know we've talked
6624800	6633920	about it though and uh damon wayan jr is gonna be um hosting that which man he is a spinny
6633920	6639600	spitting image of his father um haven't you ever seen happy endings he's in that show and that's
6639600	6644960	one of the funniest shows i've ever seen it's so good it's so good no i i'm sure he's hilarious
6644960	6650640	but uh i'm just i i'm guessing the frogger tv show is just gonna be a wipeout game i mean it
6650640	6658160	looks like a wipeout game so i guess i'm fine with that but just let frog die please if the games are
6658160	6664960	not great the old frog were good every other game that came after frogger not good tv show
6665600	6671840	probably all right so before we get to was okay before we get to dark sakura's uh headlines i
6671840	6675360	want to read this comment from chat because uh talking about a pyramid head in the track and
6675360	6682000	field game apparently we did cover this on episode number 244 of orange lounge radio look at you guys
6682000	6686720	you're on fire and we did our um silly little listless game we used to do a lot on the show
6686800	6689680	but we we haven't done it in a while because we haven't had as many guests in the studio and all
6689680	6694800	that stuff maybe someday we'll bring it back uh but um we did a list list which is that whole
6694800	6699120	little game we play to determine the top three so we actually listless what character would we'd
6699120	6706000	like to see in new international track and field so uh number three was dracula from castlevania
6706000	6710080	okay i think we had to keep it to konami games so it's number three was dracula from castlevania
6710080	6716400	number two was mr spanky the infamous uh ddr pc add-on character you'll have to google that one
6716480	6724480	and then number one was the last used to do that voice i used to and then number one was uh the
6724480	6731280	left ddr arrow from uh ddr i don't know where that came from the left arrow but that was the number
6731280	6737520	one that uh uh answer that uh oh my god we still have the mr spanky page on our wiki oh i'm sure
6737520	6743440	there's lots of old jokes on the wiki that's for sure i'm gonna put it in chat all right mr spanky
6743440	6750240	was one of those i i would i wanted i wish i could have been in that meeting where they were
6750240	6758000	discussing mr spanky and adding them to the game yes i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make uh a chat
6758000	6764640	icon of mr spanky i think you know we do still need some icons for vog but i guess we shouldn't
6764640	6767840	take them all over yeah no you should take mr spanky for your channel i don't i don't think
6767840	6771600	i'd be able to talk no i wasn't gonna do it for me i was gonna do it for vog oh i don't know if
6771600	6780160	i can talk bobbie into that betty and mr spanky but uh yeah mr spanky's uh a bit of a meme uh
6780160	6786080	at this point here on olr so i love that um yeah and and you may not know this but there is a whole
6786080	6791200	orange lounge radio wiki which you can get to at um i guess it moves i guess there's no more
6791760	6796240	wikia is a thing of the past and it's all fandom now fandom yeah yeah so it's orange lounge radio
6796480	6802960	fandom.com is where you can find the wiki for that so check that out okay um dark sakura we
6802960	6810000	we were gonna get to your headlines before we got derailed by mr spanky that's mr spanky um so uh
6810000	6816800	nintendo switch online has shown some new snus games coming out for the uh update on the 28th
6816800	6824000	of this month um claymates uh jelly boy and bomboozle are out there honestly the only of
6824000	6831840	those games i think i've played was claymates um and then uh there's not gonna be any it looks like
6831840	6842000	there's not any uh ness uh ones coming out just us ness so at least hey playmates right who cares
6842000	6847840	okay um and kind of it's like it's like the the money python and they were forced to eat robin's
6847840	6858960	minstrels there was much rejoicing yay but in japan yes that yes exactly that that's the reaction
6858960	6866800	we're forced to eat robin's minstrels yay anyway um in japan however though they're getting some
6866800	6876560	some cool shit they are getting um uh uh bomboozle just like we are but they're also getting
6876560	6882720	shin Megami tensei if and dead dance we got dead dance over here is tough enough
6883440	6891280	they had like the worst cover of all but um but i mean still probably a better game than
6891280	6897840	some of those others but i mean but uh but i mean i'm i think it's pretty good to get a shin Megami
6897840	6904720	tensei game yeah i still need to send bobby my copy of soul hackers i have two copies of soul
6904720	6916640	hackers all right um also stop asking me about cookies the answer's always no stupid thing
6916640	6926400	chocolate chip peanut butter sugar i actually i actually got a candle at target and i'll put it
6926400	6933600	on the camera in a minute but it says uh site cookies may help perform uh cook these cookies
6933600	6940000	serve to enhance the performance of your computer or something and then me same
6942400	6948800	it was kind of cute it smells like cookies anyway um so for people who are still playing pokemon go
6948800	6955760	and i'm looking at mike um you can look right over here too well yeah but um
6956720	6962720	pokemon goes august uh community day event will feature eevee
6964560	6972720	again again if you evolve eevee into any of its evolutions starting from friday august 13th to
6972720	6979760	monday august 16th it will learn a special attack evolving eevee into silveon will also require
6979760	6985600	fewer hearts than usual i actually do have all of my eevee i believe it's pronounced eeveelutions
6986480	6990480	no that's only the only the internet says that
6993600	7002000	so anyway the special moves that you're that you can get are uh for vaporeon you get scald
7002000	7009120	jolteon get zap cannon flareon gets superpower uh espeon gets shadow ball umbreon gets psychic
7009520	7014000	letheon gets bullet seed glaceon gets water pulse and silveon gets sigh shock
7015040	7020640	and then there's a whole bunch of other crap that's going to happen um you can also get a
7020640	7029600	one-time community day uh box you can spend 1280 coins on and it will give you 50 ultra balls five
7029600	7038160	incense uh elite fast tm and elite charge tm um there will be more eevees around um snapshots will
7038160	7045040	give you more surprises uh lure modules will last for three hours and incense will also last for
7045040	7052720	three hours and then if you pay a dollar you can access the eevee community day special research
7052720	7059040	story what you choose to be i'm okay with this one repeating because uh i want to grind the excel
7059040	7065040	candy uh that is uh one thing about and i think this one's across two days so i want to be able
7065040	7071520	to get a level 50 uh i have a 100 vaporeon so i really want to get them to level 50 but i find
7071520	7078160	that silveon is a very effective uh raid pokemon as well and uh as mike deaf says in chat the only
7078160	7082000	attacks that are actually worth a dam are umbreons and silveons and that's the thing they're doing
7082000	7086160	better this time is that it's the eeveelutions that are getting the special move and not the
7086160	7091280	base eevee like why give base eevee a special move you're not going to use base eevee in like
7091280	7098880	raids and stuff so i like that they're doing that differently this time so um as far as repeats go
7098880	7102800	it could have been a lot worse but i think we have to get used to the idea there are going to
7102800	7109600	be repeat days uh this game is five years old so you know it is what it is all right let's travel
7109600	7113680	around the world and check out some release dates and some things you could be playing sooner than
7113680	7119440	eevee community today if you want let's start in the us loki yeah so this week we've got a few

7216960	7221200	blaster master zero trilogy i'm really excited about that that is out on the switch they get a
7221200	7226880	limited edition if you want with a soundtrack and a um like art book so which most limited
7226880	7231280	editions are pretty much at this point but uh yeah i love that japan gets all these limited
7231280	7236720	editions so there is that to look forward to this week as well uh shin haryagami 3 is out on the
7236720	7241440	switch the great ace attorney chronicles is also out this week uh quite a bit of overlap there
7242080	7249280	susano uh japanese mythology rpg is out this week as well on the switch and i think that's it for
7249280	7255040	the switch let me look at the playstation 5 um i think it's a little slower there's some uh
7255760	7261200	accessories third-party accessories but no big games this week and i think the playstation 4 is
7261200	7267440	mostly the same stuff we already heard on the uh switch yeah that same blaster master trilogy
7267440	7273360	ace attorney and so forth i'm not oh ark ultimate survivor edition oh that game the uh online ark
7273360	7276880	game i don't have some i have some friends that are really into that but japan is getting some
7276880	7281600	sort of ps4 release like the ultimate survivor edition that must come with a bunch of in-game
7281600	7288400	crap uh and the game on a disc that is out this week in japan how about the uk dark sakura um we
7288400	7295120	have on the 27th uh neo the world ends with you um the rest are all on the 30th we have tribes of
7295120	7305280	midgard busta fellows um song of horror fear the pestilence um that actually looks interesting
7305280	7311840	vampire the masquerade coteries of new york and shadows of new york um we also have yonder the
7311840	7319840	cloud catcher chronicles and theme park simulator all right that's it let's get into some more
7319840	7325360	stories and then uh later in the show you know what we did an experiment last week and it worked
7325360	7329840	pretty well so i think tonight if you want to call into the show we'll be taking calls from
7329840	7337200	the green room so uh you can have the green room in our discord vog network.com discord and uh we'll
7337200	7342720	take calls later in the show but for now let's get into some more stories loki in more news that's
7342720	7348560	not really surprising um steam is planning on replacing big picture mode with the steam deck ui
7349520	7355680	i mean makes sense because i mean look at what the switch does it's basically the same ui um
7355680	7361840	and also probably i think big picture modes kind of needed a refresh for a while now so it makes
7361840	7366480	sense that there'd be that kind of standardization but that's what they're basically going to be
7366480	7371840	doing we're placing big picture mode with new ui from the deck uh we don't have an eta on that yet
7371840	7377600	but it is going to be something that's coming soon um i think that's probably a welcome change it'd
7377680	7383280	be interesting to see you know maybe that might make it more advantageous to have like you know
7383280	7388320	a steam console in the living room or something like that aside from just the handheld i don't
7388320	7394000	know cool uh bobby blackwolf is pointing out in our chat they've already changed the ui inside
7394000	7399680	steam vr so it's not like big picture mode anymore so okay they already were laying the groundwork
7399680	7406080	for this i guess cool i look forward to it yeah i think it's nice to give that a refresh because
7406080	7410800	the uh that big picture uis or i'm sorry the big picture mode's been kind of the same thing for a
7410800	7415360	long time so yeah it'll be nice and it's like we all get a little something different even if we
7415360	7420160	didn't get the steam deck so i don't know that part of it's kind of cute anyway yeah there was
7420160	7426160	word around social media this week that oh my gosh there was a playstation 4 crypto farm and some
7426160	7431520	pictures came out it was uh it was a farm that had been busted in ukraine and all these playstation
7431520	7436320	4s and the the titles were look at all this bitcoin they're mining and that's that's the thing
7436880	7442480	although it turns out can you believe it social media misstated the story can you believe it that
7442480	7451280	headline was proven to be false but i'm not sure the end result is any better to be honest it's
7451280	7458320	somehow it's actually worse uh they were farming and selling digital currency and accounts uh oh
7458320	7463280	for ea's fifa games that's right remember fifa is the biggest game in the world you might be
7463280	7469040	thinking but rob madden and i say but you the world it's not just america i said the world
7469040	7473840	so those fifa games are huge of course and we all know ea loves the microtransactions in the games
7474400	7480400	so anyway um yeah so you don't need to be regulated not at all a ukrainian news outlet
7480400	7486480	named delo reported that pcs were running bots on the consoles to play fifa and automatically
7486480	7494160	earn the in-game currency you use the coins in the ultimate team or foot f-u-t get it mode to
7494160	7500160	get like popular players or uh open the packs and get you know add-ons you all know how that works
7500160	7505120	loot boxes you know i'm not sure but does that stuff even transfer over now because i mean they
7505120	7509920	release a new game each year and i'm pretty certain that like your progress from one to
7509920	7514640	the other doesn't transfer over because they're greedy and they want to make all of the money so
7515600	7522240	yeah um so selling these accounts is of course against ea policies but that doesn't matter it
7522240	7526080	doesn't stop it from happening yeah like they're gonna stop it uh if you want to know how much
7526080	7532080	these go for and how much a farm like this could make a playstation 4 fifa 21 account with 5.1
7532080	7539600	million coins was going for 300 so um yeah don't support this by buying that stuff because it's
7540080	7545440	probably coming from a farm that looks like a cryptocurrency farm except it's just mining a
7545440	7552480	different type of currency and if ea has a way to make that 300 for them they're gonna find a way
7552480	7557280	yeah um mike defton chat says there's a rumor running around about fifa will go mobile only
7557280	7562720	next year like pes is doing yeah i heard about that so persona evolution soft soccer is going
7562720	7568240	to like e football um however i think that's a konami issue i think that's an issue where like
7568240	7573760	konami doesn't really make console games anymore uh they contract stuff out to let other people
7573760	7581600	make games but let's be real k set not a thing anymore so i think that's a big part of why
7581600	7587360	pro evolution soccer is changing and they're trying to make it sound like a good thing and um
7588000	7599280	no uh let's see uh other comments in chat um s2100 matt says each year is different nothing
7599280	7604560	transfers from year to year yeah that's for true all right uh let's keep going on dar sagra
7606480	7617040	so um we all like our google doodles right right right sometimes yeah well this one uh the uh
7617760	7629120	it's a jrpg mini game cute so it's from a studio uh four degrees c um has made like a little uh
7630000	7637280	olympics inspired uh doodle champion island games that you can just play around with on
7637280	7644640	their website it has uh artistic swimming archery climbing table tennis rugby marathon and
7644640	7651520	skateboarding and they're they're pretty neat pretty cool it looks really adorable i i want
7651520	7658000	this forever and there's animation on it too when you win a scroll there's also a ddr level
7658880	7662720	yeah i haven't really uh poked around in the google doodle but this sounds really cute uh
7662720	7668240	it sounds like sj100 matt and our chat has saying this google doodle is really cute and fun so i
7668240	7672080	guess there's hopefully it's one of those things you can access after it's over still like the
7672160	7677920	pac-man thing and some of the infamous things of uh you know google's past you know it is really
7677920	7684400	cute yeah all right sorry i don't i need to like stop playing it i pulled it up just to watch the
7684400	7693040	the intro again and yeah i wish i could download it no stop hey you never know sometimes these
7693040	7699440	google things turn into actual games uh case in point that april fool's prank that became pokemon
7699440	7705440	go that was that was in part inspired by a google april fool's prank where the pokemon were all over
7705440	7713200	the map it's crazy i am a big fan of inspect page source download all right uh let's move on uh
7714240	7719680	i know it's weird to talk about the nintendo hack sometimes um but the reality is we talk about
7719680	7723520	things that gaming culture and and stuff is talking about so we kind of put this a little
7723520	7728160	more towards the end of the show to talk a little bit about what has come up in the latest nintendo
7728160	7735840	leak right loki yeah so uh the the latest leak though is all sorts of different projects that
7735840	7743520	were apparently scrapped um one of course that i i'm kind of disappointed in a ddr mario 2 would
7743520	7748800	have been pretty awesome but there was also a metroid game as well um
7748880	7758800	um i just saw the second um second one on this list here and i'm not happy about this
7758800	7762000	i'm gonna skip that for right now no no no i think i think you should talk about it
7765120	7766000	i already know what it is
7768960	7775760	so they had this game um called there was a excite truck which is known as world's toughest race
7776240	7780480	um they say a racing game that looks like a four-wheel drive truck version of excite bike
7780480	7787040	with realistic uh oriented graphics but that's basically they already made that so that was
7787040	7791760	some yeah so that was something that they did make i thought see when i first read that i
7791760	7794480	thought these were all different games that were scrapped i'm like they had another one
7795360	7799440	they didn't make it i'm gonna have to kill somebody no you know it's more just like the
7799440	7804400	early concept of it but somebody had the bright idea to tie it back to excite bike and that's
7804400	7809200	cute that was smart um project hammer which was something that we knew about you know that was
7809200	7813280	something that they were showing off at e3 and stuff like that so makes sense tennis which ended
7813280	7821040	up being uh part of we sports at one point um obviously and then they had what else uh a metroid
7821040	7826640	game that was being developed by intelligent systems and this was to come out after prime
7826640	7833680	uh project x by retro studios which is an action game featuring sheik from zelda ocarina of time
7834640	7840560	they had a night's night's wars uh by kuju which is a fantasy based strategy game with
7840560	7846320	battalion wars assets uh super smash rose brawl they of course you know have that listed as
7846320	7852240	project sora which i mean we we kind of knew that um what else is interesting jump superstars for
7852240	7857840	the wii i think they did one for the wii u though so i mean that's not a big deal um
7858240	7865280	yeah that's here an unreleased n-space game it says a female spy infiltration action metal gear
7865280	7874320	like games um sounds interesting so yeah more stuff out of the leaks there's they're on they're
7874320	7880800	safe for now because that was the actual excite truck and not a sequel that they didn't make so
7881600	7888560	they didn't make so you you're you are on thin ice in nintendo to be fair they did make that
7888560	7895760	sequel they've been that doesn't count we don't talk about that sequel there should not be mini
7895760	7901440	games in the middle of a race where i have to throw pies at giant scary clowns or make a
7901440	7905600	sandwich in the middle of a race what did they call what was that game called that was it excite
7906400	7912720	excite bots that's right okay i still have it i i will still play it i just don't like it as much
7912720	7919520	as the original fair enough all right uh and our last story tonight has to do with yes this is an
7919520	7925520	actual game that's on its way out for playstation vr and it's a game called the last video store
7925520	7930000	since i don't know about you guys but i have like several people i know that have taken the track
7930000	7934160	up to i think it's it's bend right oregon where the last blockbuster is at that place has become
7934160	7938720	a meme of sorts and i'm sure is making money it's it's interesting to think that's probably
7938720	7944160	like a tourist attraction very randomly in that rural part of oregon at this point uh and that's
7944160	7949440	kind of how they're staying in business at this point is by being infamous as the last blockbuster
7949440	7955840	so uh playstation vr is doing a parody probably the last video stores i mean there's not really
7955840	7960800	video stores anymore no that's very true as well uh and so they're calling it because they don't
7960800	7965360	have any type of license and it's a little bit of parody this game is called the last video store
7965360	7971680	it is being done by rare bird games who made a game called sinfeld remaster it was a horror game
7971680	7977840	um so does that tell me it's a seinfeld horror game is that a seinfeld horror game i'm i think
7977840	7983680	it i'm trying to let me look up on it because i actually don't know um but i'm hoping our chat
7983680	7991200	might actually know yes it is it is a parody seinfeld horror game basically you went around
7991200	7998960	the apartments and you would get startled by a doll sometimes at points so um that that creative
7998960	8004880	genius is now bringing you this uh i love it so yeah there's a trailer out there you can check out
8004880	8009360	um you can explore the area around the store you can do a night drive around the neighborhood
8009360	8014320	there's a survival mode where you get realistic local jobs and bills to pay while managing your
8014320	8019360	video enthusiast hobbies on the side uh there's cult videos like evil dead and mac and me
8020080	8027680	and you can watch them in a theater i don't know how that works but okay um i'm pretty sure they
8027680	8034000	didn't license any any of this like none of this could be possibly licensed yeah but i think when
8034000	8037760	you're doing parody you can get away with a lot so as long as they're not using the actual movie
8037760	8044320	they can probably uh do it so yeah is it a horror game probably but uh more to come on this i think
8044320	8052240	this is really funny so how do they have clips from the movies in there um do they have clips
8052240	8058400	in the movies in it i see i'm watching the trailer and they have mac i see mac and me clips and maybe
8058400	8066240	they got licenses they got a deal somehow so all right but they didn't but okay sounds like some
8066240	8071120	of you uh have something to order on the playstation 4 all right anyway we'll we'll
8071120	8074320	i'll have to check that out when it gets a little closer release because i haven't bought anything
8074320	8079040	on playstation vr in a while but i want to check that out all right let's get to the listener

8103840	8109120	going to get us banned from twitch and this is also why i'm probably going to stick to trusted

8112800	8117680	recognize from other twitch channels if you're a completely random name probably not going to get

8204080	8208560	mandalorian pinball and i don't know because i was at work and then streaming and doing stuff
8208560	8214320	all day so now we have company over who is playing mandalorian right now in our garage and i haven't
8214320	8221680	touched it yet uh bobby's getting a mando machine like tomorrow so i know that's awesome well ours
8222480	8230000	we weren't going to get one and then um it just happened to fall into place that the
8230000	8232960	we could trade monster bash which i was never interested in monster bash
8233680	8241520	um so i'm i'm pleased that we were able to set up the trade um no one special 77 in chat has a
8241520	8247520	question for us tonight that says uh before the days of digital distro of games did you have a
8247520	8256000	favorite go-to store for games that no longer exists now oh it's funny bobby listed software
8256000	8263520	etc and dj ronman s uh said funco land and i was gonna say babbages and all three of those are
8263520	8270720	owned by gamestop yes yeah softworks area you see my go-to um now i can answer this with fries
8271600	8279280	yeah womp womp r.i.p fries yeah that used to be my fave um i go to target now but they're not
8279280	8287280	they're not just extinct yet uh oh go ahead i'm just saying they won't be extinct for a while
8287280	8293040	probably um s joe and hunter matt says so is the next point challenge a bobby black wolf or jamie
8293040	8297920	and dan pinball garage stream that's a good point i don't know if we've unleashed the next challenge
8298880	8305440	yet i think no i so well hold on don't randomly shout something out that we're gonna be committed
8305440	8313680	to no this is this is why it's not gonna happen oh okay okay i need um i basically my webcam
8313680	8326320	is my iphone right i would actually need two dedicated cameras and um the link for my uh
8326400	8332960	for the boards unless i did uh you know one of the older tables and then had that instead be a
8332960	8340240	third camera so i would also have to have a big rig over it an anti-glare coating on the glass
8340800	8348320	or else the lights would just reflect so terribly on there if you really want to watch um a great
8348320	8354800	great uh pinball streamer um look up jack danger um who i also need to give a shout out to
8355440	8363840	um for helping me uh with uh with dan's uh dan's uh presents last year his christmas presents
8364400	8371840	um but uh i'm trying to actually figure out what his uh dead flip pinball so yeah um his
8371840	8378960	his channel is uh dead flip and he plays so many different tables if ever you want to learn
8378960	8384560	anything about a table see him and play absolutely watch him um and yeah bobby's will sing another
8384640	8390000	great one another great pinball streamer is pb underscore undesirables and he is going to be on
8390000	8398480	a panel i'm moderating at southern fried gaming expo um there's also um i think one that's called
8398480	8404080	like bro do you pin or bro do you flip or something like that um we watch that one from
8404080	8408480	time to time um there's also another husband and wife team that are really good streamers and for
8408480	8414320	the life of me i can't remember uh their names but most of the time i'm watching jack danger just
8414320	8421360	because i know he's been a cool cool guy he'll talk to people he's pretty pretty rad he likes
8421360	8428560	to say bro a lot at least last time i watched him um yeah we haven't decided what the next bonus
8428560	8435200	stream is to be honest so i think we still had done the last one so technically rob what maybe
8435200	8440560	we should do a kill your friends we can we can set something like that up oh you want to do like a
8440560	8444960	dbd night type of the community night i guess for lack of a better term maybe something like that
8444960	8452960	i mean i completely suck and i won't play survivor but uh yeah uh technically technically it's
8452960	8457280	bobby's turn but i don't know if he has anything on deck so i just meant like eventually yeah
8457280	8463280	eventually so uh we'll see i actually have an idea as well i just have to confirm it with
8463280	8469120	because there would be other people involved in a certain day um uh okay fuck it this isn't an
8469200	8473840	official announcement but it is something that we're trying to make happen and i think will
8473840	8480240	happen uh for a bonus stream in the near future and i think this is this is a good time for this
8480240	8487280	to happen too and that is a horde house reunion stream is in the works for this year yeah so uh
8487280	8492720	stay tuned so for those that don't know uh for several years i used to host a world of warcraft
8492720	8499680	podcast uh with my friends extfer and shane and grandpa matt and i've talked to i think
8499680	8504320	two of two of the three individually that are both like okay with it uh and i need to just get
8504320	8509440	everybody else on board and make sure we have the right time frame from that so um that is that is
8509440	8517520	something we're going to uh work on for the the somewhat near future so all right that just makes
8517520	8523200	me kind of regretful that the little comic thing i was working on with slidekick never came to
8523200	8528560	fruition except for one panel or one uh one comic you know i could probably get a reading is
8528560	8533920	fundamental reunion podcast even though that was never a vog show but i guess there's you know
8533920	8542320	whatever i i still think hills brad blues could could could launch yeah speaking well i don't
8542320	8545760	never mind i can't talk out of turn i can't talk about other people's projects without the go
8545760	8551280	ahead but all i say is that there's there's other projects i'm aware of that i think want to come
8551280	8556400	back after a long hiatus and i really hope they do sending all my love and strength i also have
8556400	8561280	a project in mind that i've you know mentioned around that i i really want to do although the
8561280	8567600	name is changing is i really want to do a dead by daylight podcast but not necessarily about
8567600	8573040	the game specifically but into the community and certain players and and different things like that
8573120	8577360	and i know i've brought it up to you and you've got a lot of projects on your plate but
8577360	8582240	love to find you know good good co-host yeah i'll guest on it but i just don't want to take
8582240	8586400	i offered it to alan too i would have really loved to have alan as my co-host but you know
8586400	8592560	things are where they are yeah yeah so and if you're listening and you're into the debbies
8592560	8599360	talk to me all right um well there's nobody in the green room but let me check on any last minute
8599360	8605600	stories from loki um i wanted to mention that there was some rumors well need screenshots of
8605600	8610000	the actual product so i don't know how it's a rumor in the sense that they're not announcing
8610000	8614400	officially but there's some more arcade one up stuff including a terminator 2 machine
8615440	8620320	which looks pretty awesome um i don't know if i'd want a dedicated terminator 2 machine but it's
8620320	8625760	still pretty cool maybe like with revolutionary so there um some other games that kind of have
8625760	8632240	that same setup but um yeah and then there was the uh i think it was a capcom fighting
8632240	8638240	maybe more versus capcom or streetfare 2 it was like a cocktail cabinet so they've got um so
8638240	8643440	that looked pretty cool yeah i'm with bobby and chat who says i'll believe it when i can buy it
8643440	8649840	yeah the the earlier e3 leak got me a little hyped up uh too soon but um my wallet is thankful on
8649840	8656160	that regard so um that's fine uh arcade 1up has already put out street fighter 2 numerous times
8656160	8661360	but i the cocktail element is probably the new part of that because you know there's uh people
8661360	8666320	love those cocktail cabs and i don't blame them yeah they're pretty nice yeah i might want to get
8666320	8674080	a cocktail cabinet for uh reasons in the future we'll see so all right i had dark tissue says and
8674080	8678560	then there was that whole simpsons thing no idea where that was that yeah the official trailer was
8678560	8683680	found and then mysteriously it didn't get announced like there was a last minute licensing
8683680	8690160	problem interesting yeah we'll see we'll see all right well um i don't think we have anybody
8690160	8694320	wanting to call tonight that's okay we'll try again next week i know it's a new concept we got
8694320	8700400	to get back into that uh but i think that brings us towards the end of the show and uh that is where
8700400	8704480	we're going to uh get everybody's final thoughts but first i want to say thank you so much for

8763840	8769520	slash shop i think that's it that brings me to the final thoughts in the end part of the show
8769520	8773440	uh dark soccer i'll let you go first because you probably want to go get are you are you streaming
8773440	8778480	tonight are you i am streaming tonight no i was saying that if if you don't have to raid me every
8778480	8784320	week if there's someone you think deserves a raid more i appreciate it though i absolutely absolutely
8784320	8791920	uh i it helps me a lot and i appreciate it sure um so yeah if you feel so inclined for dead by
8791920	8798960	daylight maybe a little bit of extra discussion maybe i'll talk about my own deep thoughts about
8798960	8806320	the the blizzard thing earlier today then uh stay stay tuned for the for for after the show i'm i'm
8806320	8811520	thank you i probably am gonna raid tonight um just because i'm not prepared to do anybody else but i
8811520	8815760	will uh evaluate for next week and maybe yeah we'll spread the love a little bit sure why not
8815760	8822000	i'm also i also have a follower goal now so i'm trying to get up to 200 for my next uh steps i
8822000	8827440	would hope oh the all the olr people are following you at this point though you'd be surprised i i i
8827440	8832880	wanted to do some finger waggling so i'm gonna go ahead and duck out and use the facilities and get
8832880	8841280	myself ready for the for the show all right fair enough all right take care bye-bye okay uh loki
8841280	8846720	we can get to your final thought tonight uh my final thought is i need to now i need to figure
8846720	8850640	out what i'm gonna do next for my next video actually i already know what i'm gonna do but
8850640	8856560	i need to actually plan it out so all right get to work clock starts again get to work but maybe
8856560	8863600	not frame by frame like maybe no no maybe an easier maybe a quicker post-production i'm sure
8863600	8867760	there's a better way to do it but like i this is the first time i actually used after effects so
8867760	8873520	it was kind of a learning learning as they go um my final thought this week is um and i think
8873520	8876880	i referenced this on last week's show but i'll just uh tell you what's going on i am having
8876880	8882480	surgery on wednesday and so um it's not anything to be too concerned about um basically the deal
8882480	8886240	is you probably can't see this on twitch i'm going to try to show you anyway and apologize to the
8886240	8890720	podcast listeners but if i do a side profile you can probably actually see on my neck there's like
8890720	8895520	a little bit of a bump there's like a growth there on my neck yeah so um i've actually had that for
8895520	8900240	like four years and it's been getting a little bit bigger um and it's actually started to hurt
8900240	8905200	a little bit so they're gonna be removing it um they don't suspect it's anything bad um they'll
8905200	8910960	do all the tests on it just to make sure just out of abundance of caution um but yeah that is uh
8910960	8917360	what i'm having removed on wednesday and so um i'm gonna be in recovery um i'm hoping it's a pretty
8917360	8921760	quick thing that uh they're not making it sound like i'm gonna be it's just you know uh there'll
8921760	8925760	be stitches in it so i have to basically treat it like a wound that has stitches that you know
8925760	8930400	will take a couple days to recover and all that stuff so um uh did you remember says going to
8930400	8936640	dr pimple popper now you and i both know that is not covered by our fair insurance kind of
8937200	8942800	in this country so um i'm going to a doctor doctor doctor uh that is covered by my insurance that i
8942800	8948240	guess does the exact same thing pretty much so yeah uh and tay plays game says is it a lipoma
8948240	8951920	i've got one on my arm too usually benign you'll be fine that is exactly what it is
8951920	8956160	so it's just a weird place on my neck so yeah uh at least that's what it's been diagnosed as
8956160	8960480	so uh yeah thank you everybody i really appreciate that but that is what's going so next week if i'm
8960480	8965920	wearing a scarf on the show i don't want to hear it so i'm just gonna put that up front next week
8965920	8971200	if i'm wearing a scarf now you know why i don't want to hear it all right uh that's it have a
8971200	8978000	great week everybody we'll see you in seven days play some games uh have some fun uh don't be mean
8978000	8983600	to people online and um especially don't be mean to people in real life uh which is i think a topic
8983600	8989520	we we talked in depth about tonight um call that bullshit out when you see it everywhere
