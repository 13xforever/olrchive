0	14760	As I read the news this week, I was going to defend Streamlabs based on my own experiences
14760	17400	in open source software, forks, derivatives, and so on.
17400	22040	Then I saw that they filed for the legal right of a name that includes OBS, and we all know
22040	25480	how well that worked out for In the Groove, which didn't even include the name DDR,
25480	28880	just the entire technical foundation of it.
28880	30680	This is another story of foolish decisions.
30680	33720	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you more
33720	36680	in this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36680	38240	every gamer has a voice.
38240	42680	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42680	47960	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47960	54920	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live with y'all once again, episode number 892
54920	60520	of our show, live on this November the 21st of 2021.
60520	68120	Happy 19 November, 20 November to those back in the good old DDR days where the roots of
68120	73600	our show were made, and happy 21 November, even though I don't think that song actually
73600	75080	exists, but it should.
75080	82760	Hi, I am Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, hello, who
82760	83760	is muted.
83800	84800	Let's try again.
84800	85800	Hello.
85800	86800	Crap.
86800	87800	Gosh.
87800	88800	Hi.
88800	89800	Hi.
89800	90800	How are you doing?
90800	91800	I'm okay.
91800	92800	I'm liking the new angle tonight.
92800	97800	We get to see a little bit different angle of the lair of DarkSakura.
97800	105840	I finally, I had the hardest time finding a clamp that could sit on my big widescreen
105840	106840	monitor.
106840	113000	So finally I found a different kind of mount that I could clamp to the, you and I have
113240	114240	the same IKEA desk.
114240	115240	Oh yeah, that's right.
115240	116240	I remember that.
116240	117240	Yeah, yeah.
117240	123520	So I have a clamp that now will sit up there and have my phone, because I use my iPhone
123520	129280	as my webcam because it's far better than any webcam on the market.
129280	135440	And so I needed it a little bit more central and now it is, and people can see every time
135440	141120	I dip in, when I move with the camera, every time I try to kill people in Dead by Daylight.
141120	143600	I need to get a mic arm for my office.
143600	148400	I really like this one I have here in the old studio where we used to gather pre-COVID,
148400	150480	but I like this mic arm.
150480	155120	I need something like this that'll hold my Elgato mic, because I just bought a new, now
155120	157600	I can't even remember the name of it, but it's Elgato's microphone.
157600	159880	That's basically the response to Blue Yeti.
159880	160880	And I heard good things about it.
160880	161880	It's nice.
161880	162880	I like it.
162880	165320	It's what?
165360	172120	I was going to say the Audio-Technica one that I have is, actually mine came with my
172120	174160	arm and everything with it.
174160	176640	And it's been an absolute delight.
176640	177640	Gotcha.
177640	179300	Mike Deff says the Wave 3.
179300	180300	Thank you.
180300	181300	That is the name of it.
181300	182300	Thanks, Mike.
182300	183300	Hi.
183300	185400	And that is our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
185400	188280	nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
188280	193480	I will, twitch.tv slash, no, I haven't, Vogue Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
193480	194480	show.
194640	197640	And of course, I'm going to say hello to Techmaster Loki and his mic arm as well.
197640	198640	Hi, Loki.
198640	199640	Hello.
199640	200640	How are you doing?
200640	201640	I'm doing fine.
201640	205000	I'm a little tired because I've been staying up till three in the morning each day.
205000	208200	I hear you've been working hard on that, Mike, because I know I've seen a lot of tweets.
208200	212120	You've been really trying to kind of like wrap up your current storyline Minecraft so
212120	216920	you can move on to, I know you've got a new kind of thing for Minecraft, right?
216920	217920	So
217920	224440	I've been playing Minecraft, but I've actually been playing just on their server.
224440	228000	Yeah, their certain aircraft, just to mess around.
228000	232280	And so that's what I've been busy doing up until three in the morning.
232280	236240	But yes, this week, though, I did take off to actually work on that, because I do have
236240	237360	to finish up some builds.
237360	241000	I already have the last two episodes of the season planned already.
241000	244400	So I just have to do the things.
244400	247520	And I have one, thankfully, one of them is going to be a server tour, which is very low
247520	248520	effort.
248520	252360	No, I mean, it's not low effort, but it's just like, I don't have to build anything
252360	253360	else to design anything.
253360	254520	So it goes quicker.
254520	262160	But I still have to finish polishing up my base a bit so that it's kind of complete,
262160	263160	you know.
263160	266240	But yeah, it's gonna be fun.
266240	267240	Yeah.
267240	271600	So, you know, a lot of people took off this next week for the holidays and all that stuff.
271600	272600	So, yeah.
272600	277080	Happy Thanksgiving to all the folks out there in OLR land, at least the ones in the States,
277080	278080	Canada.
278080	279080	You already had yours.
279080	281280	And Hanukkah is the week after.
281280	282280	Oh, that's right.
282280	285000	It's really early this year, relatively, isn't it?
285000	288680	Well, keep in mind, it follows a lunar calendar.
288680	289840	I know, but still.
289840	293040	But not everybody knows that, so that's why I'm saying it.
293040	294040	Yeah.
294040	295040	Yeah.
295040	300600	So it's the same reason why Easter, you know, changes every year because it actually follows
300600	304880	the same calendar that all the other Jewish holidays follow.
304880	305880	Sure.
305880	309720	So, but my body doesn't follow or my work schedule don't follow the lunar calendar.
309720	312440	So it is a little novel to see Hanukkah in November.
312440	314800	That's not usually the way it is.
314800	315880	It's not the first time, though.
315880	318520	I'm pretty sure I've seen it this early before.
318520	322980	It's been pretty funny because like all the last few years, it's actually been, if not
322980	326760	the same week as Christmas and awfully close to it.
326760	327760	Right.
327760	332280	And which made everything easier for planning holiday stuff, but not this year.
332280	333280	So c'est la vie.
333280	334280	It is what it is.
334280	335280	That's okay.
335280	342080	I'll still have latkes until the end of the year.
342080	343320	Yum, yum, yum.
343320	347640	Wishing everyone, no matter where you are in the world, a happy Thanksgiving and in
347640	354040	the spirit of being thankful for, you know, the good things you have going on this year.
354040	358160	Hopefully, you know, it's been a year of a lot of ups and downs for me, but I try to
358160	360040	focus on the ups and being thankful.
360040	361880	And of course, I'm thankful for Sunday nights.
361880	362880	I really am.
362880	366480	I'm thankful to hang out here with you guys and talk about what's going on in gaming.
366480	372220	I'm thankful for my co-hosts who are just as crazy as I am, quite frankly, when it comes
372220	375680	to having the dedication to do this for as long as we've been doing it, heading into
375680	378800	our 20th year in a few weeks, if you can believe it.
378800	379800	What were we thinking?
379800	386920	I don't know, but this, I'm going to be honest, like this has been a hard week to be a gaming
386920	387920	fan.
387920	393040	There's a lot, there's some hard news this week that's really, really frustrating.
393040	395160	And we're going to get into that in a minute.
395160	397100	Let me try to start with something positive.
397100	398840	How about we do a feedback sandwich?
398840	402720	We'll do positive, then we'll do negative, then we'll do our gaming weeks back to positive.
402720	403900	So let's start with positive.
403900	410120	I want to give a shout out to YYR, our listener who's here a lot and emails us a lot.
410120	413800	And you might remember our last, on last week's show, he said he was going to do a stream.
413800	417560	I only was able to catch a little bit of it via mobile because I was, I'm really focused
417560	419000	on my health and my walking and all that.
419000	421720	And it just kind of happened to be around the same time, but I caught some of it.
421720	426460	And then I caught the big announcement, which we, I think I retweeted it on the OLR account,
426460	429680	but his game, so he's an indie game developer, right?
429680	434760	And you know, he developed the original Pixel Poops from an idea that came from Dark Sakura
434760	440960	and us here at OLR, which then Loki evolved into the sequel that he's talked about.
440960	446520	That's now featured in magazines as seen in Cool Shit Magazine, Pixel Poops number two.
446520	448360	I have, I have five copies coming.
448360	450720	I ordered a few copies to come in.
450720	451720	That's great.
451720	454640	Um, so, but of course YYR, he's developed other games.
454640	458160	He's got a lot of cool games that are out there on Steam and otherwise, you know, um,
458160	462560	I like falling as a, as a retro throwback, but one of the other big games he launched
462560	465620	is super multitasking, which I'm telling you guys, it's really good.
465620	469480	It's like playing WarioWare four times at once.
469480	478320	Well, YYR announced on his stream, he's adding to it a dance game pad mode and get, it's,
478320	483080	it's not just controlling the existing games, but there's a dance game thrown in.
483080	484520	No, no, no.
484520	489300	What happens is that there's like a dance game that plays in the middle bar that you
489300	491720	have to step on the arrows and do all that shit.
491720	495620	Meanwhile, the other three lanes are still lighting up with games that you're playing
495620	499000	on your controller while you are dancing.
499000	500000	It's brilliant.
500000	501000	For fuck's sake.
501000	502000	It's, it's brilliant.
502000	503160	What does he think we're made of?
503160	506140	I don't understand why this game hasn't gone viral.
506140	507140	It's so good.
507140	508220	So super multitasking.
508220	512420	And I think you'd have to have the superpowers of a single mother.
512420	516560	So anyway, check that out on Steam if you haven't already over at super multitasking.
516560	517560	Yay YYR.
517560	518560	Yay, Aaron.
518560	519560	Yay.
519560	520560	Good news.
520560	521560	Love that.
521560	525660	Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, I heard he threw down the gauntlet to Chris for life to try
525660	526660	it out.
526660	528060	Uh, yeah, he was tagged in that tweet.
528120	530220	So, uh, I thought that was, uh, pretty funny.
530220	531220	So I hope he does.
531220	532220	It's great.
532220	533220	Okay.
533220	535500	Um, not so great news.
535500	536900	Uh, let's get into it.
536900	537900	Look here.
537900	542180	I know many of you at OLR, you know what's coming because you're tuned to gaming blogs.
542180	544180	You probably listen to other podcasts.
544180	546380	You are on social media.
546380	550460	So you know why I'm about to give a hearty fuck you to Bobby Kotick.
550460	553620	And in fact, it's at a point it needs to go further than that.
553620	555220	I'll get into that in a moment.
555380	560580	Um, and it's just this Activision story that will not quit.
560580	565300	And I think we all clearly see the reason why it will not quit.
565300	568660	That reason is becoming very apparent this week.
568660	573820	However, I know there's a handful of you that, you know, you're more casual gamers.
573820	577300	Maybe you don't follow all the headlines, but you listen to OLR cause you like me, Jamie
577300	578300	and Matt.
578300	579300	Thank you for that.
579300	580580	Love ya.
580580	583820	This is a difficult content or this is a difficult topic.
583820	588820	Content warning, everything like it's, it's, it's awful.
588820	590260	This, this is awful.
590260	591260	I hate it.
591260	597580	And this is why I'm saying when it comes to being a gamer this week, this story sucks.
597580	604460	And the fact that it is not already resolved by his firing, his releasing sucks more.
604460	607020	Anyway, I've got plenty more rants coming.
607020	608740	Let's go to the facts.
608740	615140	Ricky, um, tell us about some of the things that have developed with the CEO of Activision
615140	618540	blizzards, King Bobby Kotick this week.
618540	619540	Yeah.
619540	623180	So there was a report done by the wall street journal that kind of talked about some of
623180	629300	the allegations, um, that were happening kind of behind the whole California lawsuit.
629300	634020	And they said that over the years, um, that apparently Mr. Kotick has been accused by
634020	637980	several women of mistreatment, both inside and outside of the workplace.
637980	643600	And in some instances has worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly, which
643600	647340	you know, it sounds like a person with money would do so, uh, makes sense.
647340	656180	Um, he also apparently was, uh, there was a flight attendant that, or his private flight
656180	660140	jet flight attendant who was suing him for sexual harassment.
660140	665660	Um, that was committed, I guess, by the pilot of his jet saying, I'm going to destroy you.
665660	671340	Um, and then, yeah, just lots of different examples of that kind of stuff.
671340	676540	So that's, that's kind of the kicking off point right here is as if it wasn't bad enough
676540	677540	already.
677540	679460	Now there's this kind of a bombshell report.
679460	680460	Sorry, Loki.
680460	681660	I'm going to do this to you a lot.
681660	685940	I'm going to jump in because I'm not saying this in a, I was right kind of way, but I'm
685940	686940	saying this.
687660	692380	I, I hate that this has just proven true.
692380	699020	I said way back when, when this first started, I said, the culture of a company is set at
699020	700120	the top.
700120	702640	It's set at the very top.
702640	707280	And at the time I was pointing the finger a little bit of Bobby Kotek, I backed off
707280	712540	a little bit with that response that came up and I shouldn't have this, this news that's
712540	713540	coming out.
713540	719660	This just proves that shit culture was started at the top.
719660	720660	Continue Loki.
720660	721660	Sorry.
721660	722660	Oh no.
722660	723660	It gets worse.
723660	724660	It's not just him.
724660	726820	It's not just him, but then let's, let's get into some other details.
726820	734060	So we have former blizzard technology chief built Ben Kilgore, who was fired in 2018 and
734060	738660	after investigation for multiple allegations of sexual harassment, but he was thanked for
738660	742940	his many contribute contributions over the last four and a half years.
743340	749060	Javier Panamaino, who was the former supervisor at Sledgehammer Games.
749060	755500	And he was accused of raping one woman and sexually harassing a second one.
755500	764820	Apparently they had reported those instances to the HR and back in 2017, but they apparently
764820	769060	did not investigate the allegations or fire the supervisor.
769220	776580	Dan Bunting, co-head of Treyarch, which apparently he was accused of sexual harassing a female
776580	780060	coworker in 2017, after a night of drinking.
780060	785660	In 2019, an internal investigation reported that he recommended that he be fired, but
785660	792940	that Bobby Kotek intervened to prevent that firing and saying that after considering the
792940	798100	potential actions in light of that investigation, the company elected not to terminate Mr. Bunting,
798100	800500	but instead oppose other disciplinary measures.
800500	807380	So we have a lot of like all of the higher ups, just all of these harassment allegations.
807380	810020	I mean, there's a ton of smoke.
810020	812460	Because the culture was set at the top.
812460	813940	Yeah.
813940	816300	Disgusting.
816300	818660	And he's been protecting these people.
818660	821420	It's like, he's like best buds with Yves Guimond.
821420	826420	I mean, peas in a pod.
826420	827420	What about...
827740	828740	Go ahead.
828740	829740	Go ahead.
829740	830740	Let Jamie speak.
830740	831740	Go ahead.
831740	840260	I'm also going to add in, though, that this is what happens when men are raised with a
840260	845620	disrespect for women.
845620	853220	It starts at home and then corporate wide, it starts at the top, like you said.
853220	855540	It's a symptom of a bigger problem.
855540	860420	And we're now really seeing very obvious results of this.
860420	863020	This is why feminism exists.
863020	866620	Just saying right now, this is why we're not shutting up and this is why it gets louder
866620	867860	and louder.
867860	869540	So please continue.
869540	870540	Yeah.
870540	877580	So since he was found to be not only ignoring and downplaying harassment against female
877580	880500	employees for a very long time now.
880500	889380	So there were, of course, the Activision Blizzard employees there, the Workers Alliance,
889380	894100	that's basically said, you know, we're staging a walkout because we want him to resign.
894100	897960	And of course, he's not going to resign.
897960	903300	So they even put out a petition to have him quit as well.
903300	909600	They have twelve hundred signatures of different employees at the company.
909600	915920	I mean, clearly people want him to go, but he ain't going, unfortunately.
915920	916920	Where's the part?
916920	920680	Can you can you skip to the part about Jen O'Neill and everything that she's been going
920680	921680	through?
921680	924600	Because this is the part to me that just underlines like this.
924600	929520	This is that he he is lying now.
929520	933120	This is not even like and when they when they come into this whole stuff about we're going
933120	935480	to fix it and these things are in the past.
935480	936900	No, bitch.
936900	939640	He has you all fooled.
939640	945220	He is lying now after everything came out.
945220	948340	He is still treating women like shit.
948340	949340	No.
949340	951300	So Jennifer, unequal pay and all this.
951300	952300	Go ahead, Logie.
952300	953300	Yeah.
953300	960020	So basically she had been there revealed that she had been sexually harassed at the company
960020	964980	earlier in her career and basically saying that I've been token tokenized, marginalized
964980	967140	and discriminated against.
967140	975940	And, you know, even attended, I guess, was a party in 2007 with Bobby Kotick in which
975940	980620	they had like, I guess, strippers dancing on stripper poles or something like that and
980620	986460	encourage female attendees to drink more so the men would have a better time.
986460	989940	So fun stuff.
989940	993600	I would like for him to just be castrated.
993600	995960	He needs he needs to go yesterday.
995960	1004560	Bobby Kotick needed to be fired by the board yesterday and Monday or whenever this news
1004560	1007600	came out Monday, Tuesday, whatever happened, he should have been escorted out by the board
1007600	1008600	the next day.
1008600	1011180	I can't believe and I am enraged.
1011180	1019000	I am enraged as a gamer, as somebody, as a fucking human being that is sick of this shit.
1019000	1024520	I am enraged that this motherfucker is still in power over at Activision Blizzard.
1024520	1025520	Fuck him.
1025520	1030040	And I am fucking pissed that this board is enabling him, allowing him to stay in this
1030040	1032040	position.
1032040	1035000	Did you hear this story that broke three hours ago?
1035000	1036000	Can't wait for this.
1036000	1038480	You ready for a new twist?
1038480	1044020	Bobby Kotick, the Wall Street Journal, because they have they clearly clearly they are leaks
1044020	1045020	on.
1045020	1048920	There are very big leaks on the inside from people that recognize there is a big problem.
1048920	1054080	Well, the Wall Street Journal mentioned that Kotick met with Blizzard executives on Friday
1054080	1061220	and said, quote, he would consider leaving the company if he can't quickly fix the culture
1061220	1064860	problems at the video game giant.
1064860	1069480	From the Wall Street Journal report, Mr. Kotick, who has led Activision for three decades,
1069480	1073040	stopped short of saying he would step down in a Friday meeting with executives of the
1073040	1077380	company Blizzard Entertainment Unit, but left the possibility open if misconduct issues
1077420	1080140	around the company weren't fixed with speed.
1080140	1086000	These people said it has been 30 years.
1086000	1088260	Of this culture.
1088260	1094180	That Bobby Kotick has set the time for the killer is in the house.
1094180	1097420	The problem is in the house.
1097420	1107240	The issue is Bobby Kotick, who must go now.
1107240	1109000	And that's it.
1109000	1115500	And I am so enraged with this to a point, and I I will no longer stand by and enable
1115500	1117140	this company.
1117140	1121480	And I feel horrible saying this because I know people that work at Blizzard.
1121480	1123000	I know people that work at Activision.
1123000	1126480	I know people that were laid off at Blizzard while Bobby Kotick continued to receive a
1126480	1127600	huge bonus.
1127600	1129280	That's a whole other point.
1129280	1131020	And I know these are good people.
1131020	1132340	These are victims.
1132340	1137940	These are victims of this culture that Bobby Kotick is set.
1137940	1144340	Why doesn't the zero tolerance policy that was set apply to the man at the top?
1144340	1148980	Why is the board not applying that policy consistently?
1148980	1154780	And as far as I'm concerned, I want nothing to do with Activision Blizzard King until
1154780	1156780	this man is removed.
1156780	1161860	And when I say that, I mean, I'm not talking about their products on the show anymore.
1161860	1164240	And I know there's a lot of people that are going to say big fucking deal.
1164240	1165780	Nobody listens to your podcast anyway.
1165780	1166780	But you know what?
1166780	1168940	It's got to fucking start somewhere.
1168940	1175780	I am not going to stand by and promote this fucking culture until Bobby Kotick is gone.
1175780	1177980	Period.
1177980	1183040	So as far as I'm concerned, as excited as I was for Diablo 4, I regret buying Diablo
1183040	1184040	2.
1184040	1186200	I will no longer talk about those games on this show.
1186200	1188140	And it sucks.
1188140	1190140	As a fan of gaming and someone who is a gamer.
1190140	1191980	You want to hear about those companies?
1191980	1195660	I'm sorry, but you're going to need to go somewhere else.
1195660	1196660	It's as simple as that.
1196660	1198760	And I'm sorry to my friends that work there.
1198760	1201300	And believe me, I've heard the other side.
1201300	1205740	You're not helping those people by boycotting these products.
1205740	1206920	I'm sorry.
1206920	1209580	This is where my conscience is at.
1209580	1216060	I cannot tell people to spend money that's going to ultimately end up in Bobby Kotick's
1216060	1217060	pocket.
1217060	1218700	I'm sorry.
1218900	1221720	It's not even just that because he's there.
1221720	1223780	He's actively hurting the company.
1223780	1229540	I mean, basically, both the heads of PlayStation and Xbox have been disturbed by what they've
1229540	1231180	been hearing.
1231180	1236180	And even Xbox, you know, they said, well, you know, basically, this type of behavior
1236180	1237180	has no place in industry.
1237180	1242820	And they said that even reconsidering their relationship with the company.
1243500	1245300	I appreciate that.
1245300	1249020	I realize he has to use softer language because it's corporate speak.
1249020	1254020	He can't say the things I'm saying now because he's the head of a very large gaming company.
1254020	1257460	But I respect the hell out of Phil Spencer for taking that stand.
1257460	1262240	I respect the hell out of him for saying, for not falling in line and letting the money
1262240	1263500	do the talking.
1263500	1268160	And for, you know, I'm sure Call of Duty or what the fuck ever Activision's got going
1268160	1270940	on in partnership with Xbox right now.
1271820	1276300	I've got a real respect for Phil Spencer to look in the face of all that and say, you
1276300	1279460	know what? Maybe we need to not.
1281300	1287460	So props to you and to be fair, Sony has made a I believe Sony made a similar statement
1287460	1288580	and I apologize.
1288580	1292620	I don't in the moment remember who, but I think that should be commended as well.
1292620	1295180	I don't want to give Microsoft all of the credit I want.
1295660	1299620	And this is the part that makes me feel a little better is that some of these other
1299620	1301060	people are now putting the pressure on.
1301060	1304780	And this, unfortunately, is the only thing the board is going to really be able to see.
1305300	1307620	It was the CEO, Jim Ryan.
1307940	1309740	Thank you. So thank you, Jim Ryan.
1309740	1314020	Thank you, Phil Spencer. Thank you for doing what needs to be done because I'm.
1314460	1315940	Yeah, money speaks.
1315940	1320180	If they're going to take the money out of the pocket, then that's what I'm down for.
1320300	1322100	Right. It's it's.
1323100	1332820	I'll put it this way, if I were to express exactly how angry I am, I would probably have
1332820	1335860	to do that and then go on a very long break.
1339900	1343020	And I want to make this very clear, even though I have said.
1344380	1347980	We are not going to cover Activision Blizzard King until this man is gone, which I'm hoping
1347980	1349940	will be a one week boycott, quite frankly.
1349980	1355380	I'm hoping next week this this all reaches, but unfortunately, the time for this to happen
1355380	1356500	has already passed.
1357420	1362820	So I don't know if that's the holidays messing this all up or what, but I'm standing by
1362820	1366420	this. We're not talking about that company until that man is gone.
1367220	1369580	So and but here's the thing, and this is very important.
1370340	1371460	It is not my place.
1371460	1375700	It is not your place to tell other content creators what they can and cannot play.
1376700	1381740	I already told you that some people have a different outlook, that by not talking about
1381740	1384060	the products, you're hurting the frontline workers.
1384780	1389140	I think Bobby Kotick is a man that has already hurt frontline workers, and that's been
1389140	1393620	demonstrated from the layoff that he did prior while he still pocketed a large bonus with
1393620	1399180	that. So that's why that's a huge part of why I reached the conclusion that I did, is
1399180	1402500	that if Bobby Kotick wants a bonus, he'll he'll lay people off.
1402500	1404700	And that's really unfortunate and shitty.
1405380	1410060	But again, it's not up to us to tell other content creators what they can and cannot
1410060	1411940	cover. So I want to make that very clear.
1412140	1415980	If you have friends that are streaming Overwatch and continue to do so or whatever, then
1416060	1417340	you know what? More power to them.
1417980	1422460	For example, some some deep friends here of Orange Lounge Radio that used to be a part of
1422460	1425100	the Voice Geeks Network are pals over at Girls Gone Wow.
1425260	1430620	I fully expect them to continue their show and talk about this community that they love,
1430620	1434620	because some things are bigger than a video game.
1434780	1439820	And I think the community over there is probably the only thing that's been keeping
1439820	1444700	folks in check during all of this other bullshit that's been going on.
1444820	1450060	And I fully support that if they want to continue to talk about that community.
1450060	1454540	And honestly, it is a support group at this point.
1458340	1459940	I will say this for myself.
1460100	1468220	Yeah, if anybody has switched over, like on their stream to playing a game by that
1468220	1472260	company, I leave and stop posting.
1473900	1484620	I'm not going to help anyone benefit from a company that has done this, if that makes
1484620	1486420	sense. That is my choice.
1486460	1489500	I get it. And again, I hope this is over by Tuesday.
1489780	1493220	I hope Bobby Kotick is out the door and we really have something to be thankful for in
1493220	1495260	this industry that the poison is finally cut out.
1496540	1500420	But until that happens, I'm digging my heels in.
1501100	1503420	I'm getting ready to die on this hill.
1504060	1508740	Once he's out, it still isn't going to be immediate.
1509980	1512220	No, it's not, but it's going to go a long way.
1512620	1517700	I think the first step, the board needs to be looked at as well for their failure to
1517700	1523300	act. But I get that there are nuances that make things a little more complicated than
1523300	1525140	that, but I'm still not happy.
1525980	1530260	Oh, no, I think that once he's gone, then the board needs to be evaluated.
1530700	1538860	I mean, if I had my way, there would be a third party oversight group that would step
1538860	1540020	in and manage the whole thing.
1541020	1541500	Agreed.
1541540	1547420	Because clearly those in power at this company cannot be trusted to do the right
1547420	1555460	thing. And I want to go on record saying that most this is something that's been a
1555460	1558820	problem in the corporate world for a very long time.
1559220	1568100	We would still have longer than eight hour work days and 40 hour work weeks and children
1568100	1573300	would still be working if it wasn't for the fact that we have legislation and third
1573300	1579580	parties who have stepped in to put companies in line because greed is greed and it never
1579580	1586260	goes away. Just just look at the history and I'm not going to go like on a big lesson
1586260	1588420	here, but look at the history of unionization.
1589500	1592620	Look at the history of labor in the US.
1592620	1595180	I mean, just look at why we have freaking Labor Day.
1595740	1602380	Yep. This is a problem that has been proven that if you if you leave something unchecked
1602380	1608700	like that, it is going to continue to run rampant until it until someone's hurt or many
1608700	1612220	someone's are hurt and then someone else has to check in.
1613580	1619660	And I I do hope from all of this, we really start to get that talk of that video game
1619660	1625260	union. And I hope that starts at Activision Blizzard King, because I do hope for my
1625260	1630180	friends that work there, I hope I truly hope the organization can come out stronger at
1630180	1633860	the end of this from employees having a seat at the table.
1634140	1638460	And from what I understand, that's what many of them have been asking for in the first
1638460	1643140	place. But obviously, Bobby Kotick being removed now is the first step in that
1643140	1649540	happening. I would also like to say for our friends that are in that employment
1649540	1653300	situation, don't be mad at the people who are boycotting.
1653300	1656300	Be mad at the company you work for from putting them in that position.
1657060	1662140	This is this is this is a problem we have with your senior management and that and I
1662140	1664460	feel horrible for the people on the front lines.
1664460	1666500	I really do. I really do.
1666900	1673580	But this is something that they'll have to continue to address with with their HR to
1673580	1677860	make. And I would say this, too, if you are dealing and this is for any job, by the way,
1678140	1683620	if you are dealing with harassment of any variety at your work, document every last
1683700	1691580	thing, not just having, you know, a printout of not a printout, but like, you know, oh,
1691580	1693380	I went to HR on this day electronically.
1693380	1694900	No, you print that shit out.
1695060	1697420	You have a physical record of it.
1698340	1703620	It just and it's sorry, it just scrolled along the bottom that there's a report about
1703620	1707420	the guy at Activision Blizzard who signed all his emails, 1-800-ALLCOCK.
1709140	1710900	Document that, PDF it.
1711460	1716300	That's it took years for that person to get by, and that's just another just add it to
1716300	1718100	the dumpster fire seriously.
1719460	1726860	But but again, it is if you're remotely in a situation like that documented, it's going
1726860	1733700	to come back and you your document could help other people and it surely should have
1733700	1736740	been done with Activision for many more of the employees.
1737740	1741700	I mean, retrospect, you know, hindsight, but I'm saying that.
1743020	1750660	I'm glad to see what's coming out is coming out, but there needed to be something done
1750660	1755980	way too long ago, and that's really what has me angrier than anything, even if I am
1755980	1758860	not expressing things.
1759860	1768500	Loudly or verbally, passionately, my emotions are still there, and I am just simply trying
1768500	1773060	not to lose my shit because I am also angered.
1773980	1777220	Someone needs to stay calm while I'm over here yelling, it's fine.
1778300	1781420	I'm not I'm I'll put it this way, I'm not calm on the inside.
1781860	1783100	Fair, completely fair.
1783700	1789500	Um, Bobby Kotick's bonus, that CEO bonus, the board bonus, they need to redistribute
1789500	1791380	that to the victims, the employees.
1791620	1793540	That's my other big for the employees.
1794060	1798180	Take that one hundred and fifty three million dollars and give it to the employees who've
1798180	1801180	been making those games, who've been working their ass off through all this bullshit.
1801220	1805380	It's just they should find him for back amounts.
1806220	1815860	I also the other shining light in this, which is so weird to say, is don't forget this
1815860	1820020	company is still under investigation by the state of California, and Bobby Kotick has
1820020	1820780	been subpoenaed.
1823780	1825900	I would love to see him locked up.
1826300	1830900	I mean, he's a man, he's a man and he's rich, so it's not going to happen.
1831300	1834100	Yeah, they're going to have an impossible time proving anything criminal.
1835060	1835980	But I would.
1837460	1841140	Well, especially in light of the verdict out of Wisconsin.
1841180	1844420	Yes, I would love to see.
1846940	1851180	I would love to see some justice in any sort of way at this point.
1851620	1854820	Well, that we all know is going to go to higher.
1856420	1860140	I just want him out of the gaming industry.
1860180	1861620	I want I want him out here.
1861620	1863380	I don't want him really going into another industry.
1863420	1867740	I want him. I want him to be never heard from again.
1869460	1872780	Yeah, all right, how about a nice bottomless pit somewhere?
1872900	1877980	I, I have I think we have to be very careful and say that we're using a lot of hyperbole.
1878500	1883940	Yes, we are. But I'm reminded of a Wendy Williams clip when she was talking about Ms.
1883940	1884980	and Mr. Spears.
1886100	1890900	I'm not going to repeat it because somebody will report it, even though it's hyperbole.
1891900	1894540	But that we know it, that's where my brain is right now.
1895140	1897940	How many times have we heard this in a certain mutual friend stream?
1898340	1903820	Yeah. Oh, yeah. When it when it when it comes to their careers, that clip.
1904780	1911220	Yes. Although, however, if he was on fire, I wouldn't offer any water.
1912900	1915060	Quest Buster and I say that also is hyperbole.
1915540	1920700	Quest Buster in chat says, as a weird side note, ATVI stock price has fallen
1920780	1925860	30 percent since news of the investigation broke this summer, allowing Roblox to pass
1925860	1927860	them in value a few days ago. Good.
1928220	1930540	That's that's where it's going to hurt them the most.
1930620	1933580	And if you're holding Activision Blizzard stock, I would encourage you to sell it.
1933740	1935540	I even made a tweet earlier this week.
1935540	1940820	I was like, we need a movement like what we had with the whole like GameStop and AMC
1940820	1945820	thing where we we need to hit Activision Blizzard there and make sure the stock stock
1945820	1947460	is being sold off in mass.
1947780	1952860	I somebody had replied to me and said that's not but I think they kind of
1953100	1955540	misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying we need to buy the stock.
1955540	1959420	I'm saying we need to be pushing this narrative within the financial media and
1959420	1962860	within the financial markets and making sure that this is giving coverage on
1962860	1966740	financial media so that people sell their stock and unload it.
1966940	1970540	And that's that's going to do the talking, unfortunately, at the end of the day.
1970740	1977140	But I will say we need to have some sort of financial devaluation enacted.
1977700	1983980	But I will say I was at the gas station getting way too expensive gas in my
1983980	1985300	thankfully hybrid car.
1986140	1989860	You know how the gas station plays those little TV things that show you the weather
1989860	1990900	and headlines and stuff?
1990900	1994420	Guess what? This was the headline they were talking about at the gas station.
1995500	1997020	So, you know what?
1997020	1998900	I usually just walk off and ignore those things.
1999260	2002060	Well, I've seen I've seen they're pumping my gas starts.
2002060	2004460	I have lots of gas.
2004460	2006380	But gas has automatic things on them now.
2006380	2008260	True, true. All right.
2008260	2017180	Anyway. OK, I know anything else to add here, any other negativity palette or
2017180	2018860	something? Well, no, we'll get to another story.
2018860	2020420	We'll go to our gaming weeks and we're done here.
2020420	2022940	But I just want to make sure we've talked about everything.
2024420	2029660	Yes, pretty much the only thing I was going to mention also is the organization
2029660	2035220	girls who code was partnered with Activision and obviously severed their ties
2035220	2036940	because of all the crap that's going on.
2036940	2038980	It's kind of hard to be partnered with a company like that.
2038980	2043460	This time, you think you think under understand that call.
2043460	2045260	Much love to girls who code.
2045260	2050340	Much love to them. E3VL pointing out in chat, Call of Duty sales dropped 40 percent
2050340	2051420	compared to last year.
2051660	2053580	That's another game stocks.
2053580	2055140	But that that's totally different.
2056260	2058460	All right. All right. That's actually not different.
2058460	2060020	It's what else is doing basically.
2060340	2061940	But it shouldn't hurt the cause.
2062380	2065060	Right. To have it be such a.
2066140	2072340	Piece of shit. And remember, that was Bobby, that was Bobby Kotex call to pull
2072340	2076020	all of the studios to work on that flop.
2077460	2080260	Just food for thought, that was Bobby Kotex call.
2081260	2085860	So if you all if you financial peeps are mad about that, guess who needs to go?
2086380	2091340	By the way, there's a lot of other hideous shit he's been involved with that you should
2091340	2092620	look at anyway. I'm done.
2092620	2094300	I promise. Let's cleanse our palate.
2094460	2098820	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and talk about some happy things like I'm sure Dark
2098820	2103020	Sakura is going to talk about murder in video games, in video games.
2104740	2106140	Yes, I did murder some people.
2107340	2111500	I, of course, played Dead by Daylight because I stream it.
2113260	2117780	I also at least patched my Animal Crossing.
2118700	2119980	So I'm taking steps.
2121220	2126180	And of course, Fantasian, I did like a little bit of a grindy grind, I actually had to
2126180	2132380	start my my stream for it a little bit late, and so I just played around and did some
2132380	2134100	quests and some stuff like that.
2136380	2144860	But I'm I'm having thoughts about the state of Dead by Daylight, and it's kind of not
2144860	2149100	quite what I think some of the other streamers are saying, because there's a lot of
2149100	2152420	stuff that they're saying about it, kind of ad nauseam.
2153980	2161020	And I am now at the point where I'm just like, if a game is going, you know, if if
2161020	2165300	people are going to be shit, if MMR is going to be shit, if all of this is just going to
2165300	2168580	be the ultimate in garbage, then fuck it, I'll meme.
2168580	2174980	Let my MMR get low, let me start winning some more games, then have it get shitty again,
2174980	2176340	and then I'll meme some more.
2177460	2181780	At this point, I'm kind of done with the complaining about it.
2182780	2191940	I want I want Karina to come out already, I want my artist who has an amazing backstory
2191940	2195580	and an amazing level and is an amazing character designed to boot.
2196500	2197580	I'm so excited.
2197860	2202060	Also, dear Hawkins Laboratory, rest in fucking hell.
2205700	2210060	That's right, that the map was finally removed this week, as the Stranger Things
2210060	2214180	characters no longer purchasable in the store, they are they're gone.
2214180	2217820	And although you can still play them a game if you if you had them from before, there's
2217820	2225340	more to it, because their perks are now generic, you can no longer adept challenge
2225340	2228100	them, which means I won't see any more fucking adept Steves.
2228980	2229940	I didn't realize that.
2229940	2231900	Well, that's sad, because I never got those achievements.
2231900	2233700	But well, the achievements don't exist.
2234460	2237220	Oh, they are gone, removed for everybody.
2237220	2240420	Oh, wow. OK, so you're off the hook, Rob.
2241020	2245340	I didn't is that I mean, I'm sure that's true on like Steam and the PC places.
2245420	2246740	Is that true on Microsoft?
2247180	2255020	And that should be true everywhere, because I think it wasn't I think it was was a hydro
2255020	2257260	that was doing adept challenges the other day.
2257580	2261140	Oh, he does a lot of either hydro or merit or Meru love hydro.
2261140	2263500	Shout out to hydro. Yeah, hydro is awesome.
2263500	2266780	But it was either hydro or Meru, because those are the two people that I usually will
2266780	2270740	watch earlier in the day and went to go look.
2270740	2275220	And the the achievements for them were gone.
2275220	2283380	And indeed, I think if I go and look at my because I have a Stadia achievement thing on
2283380	2284660	here. Right, right.
2285020	2289180	And I am looking at my adept list for survivors.
2290020	2293980	And I I don't see them on the adept list at all.
2293980	2296460	I'm actually going to resort my list in alphabetical order.
2296900	2300180	Bobby Blackwolf and chat says, I wonder if you lose gamerscore when they delete
2300180	2302780	achievements. That's why I'm fascinated with this concept.
2302780	2306540	I I'm not familiar with games deleting achievements.
2306540	2311580	I I would think that maybe the people who earned them probably keep them, even if they
2311580	2316260	don't show, they might be in a hidden category, but they probably just don't show up as
2316260	2319980	achievable for new people. But even then, that's also kind of fascinating to me in a way.
2320660	2326180	Well, OK, so I looked it over and yeah, they are completely off of the list.
2326180	2330100	There is no more adept for them at all, even on Stadia's readouts.
2330300	2333220	Interesting. OK, that's fascinating to me.
2333860	2336740	I also thought I got adept trapper.
2336860	2337940	I'm sad that I didn't.
2338460	2341700	Oh, well, I was like, why isn't that on my unlock list?
2341700	2342780	Oh, I must not have gotten it.
2344420	2345420	All right. Anything else for you?
2347460	2355980	I guess that when I do my my mental breakdown streaming, which will be every day while I'm
2355980	2360660	on medical leave, except for when I do my labs and I'll talk a little bit about that.
2363220	2367100	I maybe might try to do adept challenges for killers.
2367940	2372060	And my mental breakdown will be televised.
2373340	2377700	Just if you need to step away, please step away, you know, do what you need to do, take
2377700	2378700	care of Jamie first.
2379300	2383220	I think it's going to be hilarious because when I'm not on my meds, I'm either super
2383220	2387780	funny or I'm so pathetic that I'm super funny to bullies.
2388340	2389420	Oh, boy. All right.
2389420	2391300	Just don't want to see you.
2391860	2394300	I'm trying to have a good sense of humor about it.
2394500	2398580	And that's good, but I just don't want to see you broadcast something you will wish you
2398580	2399380	had later on.
2399740	2400700	I'll I'll know better.
2400900	2402780	Yeah, good. All right.
2403180	2404220	Let's head over to Loki.
2404820	2405940	How was your gaming week, Loki?
2406580	2407500	It's all Minecraft.
2407620	2408860	It's always Minecraft.
2410780	2414740	This week, though, I did put out a new video, so that was pretty good.
2414820	2421940	I got more done on my base and then the it's not covered in this week, so I'll go ahead
2421940	2427700	and say it. Then the news came out that the the next update for Minecraft 118 is coming
2427700	2428580	out on the 30th.
2429300	2434060	And so that screwed up all my timetables because I thought, oh, I've got like four more
2434060	2437460	weeks. And I was planning on doing like some really elaborate things.
2437460	2446860	And it's like. Damn it, by the way, which is fine, because what I wanted to do probably
2446860	2451860	once again, overscoping the idea, I want to get into animation as well.
2451860	2457180	But I think it would take in too long and it would just be very hard to do.
2457220	2461700	It would've been cool. But the new the new plans now are better.
2461700	2468220	And it's kind of exciting going into the next season and being able to hang out with the
2468220	2473820	people on the server this weekend and actually have voice chats with people like that's
2473820	2477300	just something that I thought I would be doing on my current server.
2477300	2482540	But now it's kind of fun and then also pissing off somebody because I built a shop on
2482540	2483380	top of their pumpkin.
2484220	2486300	But, you know, Minecraft drama.
2488300	2493740	So, yeah, I'm just going to be finishing up stuff this week and finishing up the build
2493740	2498860	for that. Also starting planning for next season as well and just kind of.
2500100	2503500	You know, diving right into that once we get started, I think it's probably going to be a
2503500	2507220	couple of weeks. Well, whenever the server version is available.
2507220	2508500	So usually about the week after.
2508500	2511460	So hopefully it'll be starting a new season in like two weeks.
2512580	2515780	Awesome. Yeah, look forward to more videos.
2515780	2518340	Good luck to you. Hope the new server works out well.
2518340	2521540	I know. I know getting discovered is always the challenge.
2521700	2526820	It's one we've been facing here at OLR for a long time, but I hope I hope you get it.
2526820	2528420	I hope you get that spark that breaks through.
2528420	2534500	I really do. So my gaming week, I guess I'll follow up to the Dead by Daylight talk.
2534500	2535780	I've also been playing a little bit.
2535780	2540260	I've been kind of getting back into killer, oddly enough, even though I don't love getting
2540260	2542260	bullied sometimes because I'm not great at killer.
2542420	2545700	I think I think, Jamie, I've reached a similar conclusion, a different way.
2545700	2549100	I'm just kind of in that point where I'm like, I don't care if I lose, like if I lose.
2549100	2554020	So what? Like the only person that knows is me and maybe the people that bullied me, but
2554020	2555980	it's whatever. They'll just go on to the next match.
2556420	2558340	I stopped considering it as losing.
2558500	2559700	Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
2559700	2561780	That's true. It's just a game.
2561780	2566900	You know, it's if you had fun, then you won.
2567220	2569980	And if you bring no edge, you'll almost always at least get one kill.
2570980	2575700	But and if you bring no ed and people bitch about it, you can then go, oh, how dare I use
2575700	2579060	a perk that was programmed into the game intended to be used by the developers.
2579140	2582820	Bring Soul Guard. Cleanse your damn totems.
2582980	2584500	Yeah. Easy asses.
2584500	2586420	I will. No, you're fine.
2586420	2589740	But funny enough, the killer that I'm like super into right now, I actually don't have
2589740	2591500	no ed on. It just hasn't come up in the roulette web.
2591860	2595300	I am super fond of Pinhead right now is like the killer.
2595300	2600940	I really enjoy playing like I yes, I find the chain mechanic and all that stuff extremely
2600940	2605740	satisfying. I love that when they go do the box, if you aren't chasing anyone else, you
2605740	2608700	get like a free teleport right to smash the survivor.
2609420	2610780	There's a lot about it.
2610940	2616900	And like when people fuck up Pinhead's mechanic, the entire match snowballs for them.
2616900	2621500	And I had a match like that last night where it was like nobody bothered to open the box
2621860	2623420	I found the box is Pinhead.
2623420	2627700	So basically when you're playing for those who don't know Dead by Daylight, when when the
2627700	2633060	survivors are doing the thing, yeah, you have to you have about 60 seconds every so often
2633220	2635180	to solve the lament configuration.
2635180	2636500	And this is a thing out of the movies.
2636620	2640580	And if you don't solve it, basically chains start showing up everywhere.
2640580	2644020	And not only do they slow you down, but now the killer can see the chains.
2644180	2647860	So I as the killer know where you are because I hear the chains go off.
2648180	2654260	And then even to make that even worse, if you don't solve the box in 60 seconds, if I find it
2654260	2660260	first and I as Pinhead solved the lament configuration, then all of you scream, I
2660260	2664940	instantly know where you all are located and you go right into the chain phase for at least 30
2664940	2666500	seconds until a new box spawns.
2667220	2669900	I as Pinhead cannot see where the box spawns.
2669900	2670980	I have to come across it.
2670980	2675620	Normally the survivors, they can all see it and let there is an add on that makes it a lot
2675620	2676500	harder to find.
2676500	2678980	But I don't run that out on because it doesn't pop up very often for me.
2679260	2680980	But yeah, I love I don't know.
2680980	2681940	I'm like super into Pinhead.
2681940	2682500	It's weird.
2682500	2687300	So and I when somebody drops a palette, I love like because the other big mechanic is that you
2687300	2690900	can like you basically separate from your body to throw a chain.
2691060	2695140	So you do this thing where you like project out where you want the chain to start and then the
2695140	2699740	camera flips to where the chain is and you can drive the chain hopefully into selfies.
2700100	2701060	Do you do hook selfies?
2701220	2702580	I do palette selfies.
2702580	2704780	When somebody throws a palette down, I'm waiting there.
2704780	2707980	I'm I start with the hook and I'm waiting there to release the button.
2708100	2711380	And then when they drop the palette, release, chain them right on the other side of the palette.
2711900	2714100	But I mean, where you take the screenshot.
2715460	2717100	Oh, no, I don't do the screenshot.
2717100	2718060	No, no, no, that's clever.
2718060	2724340	Yeah, if you can stand next to the hook and then you throw the chain and it turns the camera
2724340	2733660	around and which is really funky because when you play as a killer and there are two boundary
2733660	2738660	breaks, by the way, and I'm glad one of them showed what it looks like when you play killer and
2738660	2743660	you go into like a third person perspective when you should be in your first person's perspective.
2743860	2747020	And it shows how like their body is skewed, you know, a certain way.
2747220	2755100	I think it's funny that it readjusts to the way a survivor sees it when you when you do that.
2755180	2756460	I mean, I guess it kind of has to.
2756460	2758500	But I think it's interesting just how quickly it happens.
2758660	2762220	It is, you know, I love like behind the scenes stuff like that.
2762660	2765700	Real quick update on the achievement front in our chat.
2765700	2766980	Bobby Black Wolf is in chat.
2766980	2771980	The good Bobby, who says, OK, yeah, it looks like they didn't delete the achievements.
2771980	2772860	This is on Xbox.
2772860	2774340	He's just did the research there.
2774340	2774820	He didn't research.
2775180	2780740	They didn't delete the achievements more than they renamed them and gave them different unlock criteria.
2780780	2781860	So that's kind of interesting.
2781860	2787140	So they probably, instead of making it Adept Steve, probably made it get out with these three perks.
2787140	2789380	And it's just some whatever.
2789820	2791580	Bobby says Steve did the rename too.
2792340	2798540	That's interesting, because I thought I mean, there are already challenges to get out with certain.
2798540	2803900	I mean, I guess that is the way to redo the Adept, but it's not you could do that with any character now.
2804140	2804580	Interesting.
2804580	2813860	So Bobby Black Wolf says the achievement so alone, which I am assuming is the Steve Adept, because that sounds like him, is now Operation Survival in a public match repair.
2813980	2815540	Oh, no, that's in a public match.
2815540	2818740	Repair the generator in the treatment theaters, operation theater and escape.
2818740	2822380	Oh, that's oh, but that's probably that was probably the Hawkins achievement before.
2822380	2823540	And they moved it to Larry's.
2823540	2824780	That's probably what that one is.
2824780	2825980	That actually makes sense.
2825980	2828620	That makes a lot of areas because they're sort of the same kind of.
2828620	2830340	Yeah, they're very similar map being indoors.
2830340	2831420	Yes. Interesting.
2831820	2832900	OK, moving on.
2833540	2836900	I have other games to talk about, so I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.
2837340	2841580	That expansion should have been out by now, but it was delayed and that's OK.
2841900	2844500	I don't remember if I mentioned on the show, but I got all my jobs.
2844500	2846620	I hit that goal of getting everything to 80.
2846820	2848340	So I'm ready for the expansion.
2848340	2857900	Now I'm just doing Moogle tome runs and trying to get more mounts and just upping my collection, getting ready for Endwalker, which early access is December 3rd.
2857900	2859460	I'm very excited about that.
2859460	2865660	So, yeah, I was playing a little more Forza Horizon five, which is still a great game.
2865820	2867620	I was playing that a little bit earlier in the week.
2868060	2874100	And then later this week, on Friday, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were released.
2874740	2880420	And I picked up Brilliant Diamond, which seems to be the one a lot of people are getting in retrospect, looking at my friends list.
2880420	2884980	I wish I'd got Shining Pearl, but there's more Pokemon I like and diamond.
2885180	2887780	So I've been playing that.
2887780	2890860	And yeah, I'm already through the second gym.
2890860	2896020	I say already, like some of you guys have probably already beaten the game, but for me, that's good progress.
2896340	2898180	And I'm just enjoying playing Pokemon.
2898380	2900420	I love the quality of life stuff.
2900420	2902420	I know some of the purists can't stand it.
2903180	2904740	Respectfully, you're wrong.
2904900	2912820	These are great changes, for example, the experience share being there and on by default from the very beginning without it being explained.
2912940	2913740	Fantastic.
2913740	2917220	Love that experience share is such an important part of Pokemon.
2917220	2918300	I don't understand.
2918660	2924900	Yeah, I think you're just living in the dark ages or you just clamor for an old game from the mid 90s if you're still tied to that.
2925500	2927020	So I love that that's there by default.
2927500	2932020	The changes that they did to the underground to make more Pokemon available sooner are pretty cool.
2932180	2934900	And yeah, I'm just I'm just enjoying playing the game.
2934900	2936900	I'm having a good time with a Pokemon game.
2937620	2942580	Mike Defton chat says, I'm stuck at the beginning, shining, shiny hunting for a starter.
2942860	2944260	Well, that's that's you.
2944260	2951700	Shane was doing a similar thing, I think, but he gave up that intro sequence before you get the starter.
2951820	2953300	That takes a while.
2953460	2956220	Like you don't just start the game and get a starter.
2956420	2960180	You have to kind of go through the town you started and then go up the trail.
2960420	2962100	It takes a minute to get there.
2962100	2964940	So I can see how resetting is a pain in the ass.
2965820	2973660	E3VL points out if you have Let's Go and Sword and Shield, if you have those save files on the switch, you can get Mew and Jirachi.
2973660	2974500	That is true.
2974700	2976860	You don't see them until you get to the flower town.
2977060	2979540	But there's an old man and an old woman in the flower town.
2979540	2982780	And the old man will give you Jirachi for having Sword and Shield.
2982940	2985580	And the old woman will give you Mew for having Let's Go.
2985580	2986700	I have them both.
2986820	2992340	And Jirachi, at least as of right now, is on my team because I enjoy enjoy that one.
2992340	2996340	So, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.
2996340	2997340	I don't know what else to say.
2997340	2998820	It's a Pokemon game. It's fun.
2999020	3000260	I'm enjoying it. We'll see.
3000260	3002060	We'll see if I stick with it all the way to the end.
3002060	3010740	I have a weird feeling it'll probably take me a year to beat it just because when Final Fantasy 14 expansion comes out, everything else is on hold.
3010740	3015860	And you are not going to hear me talk about anything else for at least four weeks or until I get to the end of the story.
3015860	3016660	It is what it is.
3016780	3017740	We all have our thing.
3017740	3018500	That is my thing.
3018780	3020260	Dark Sakura's got Dead by Daylight.
3020260	3021180	Loki's got Minecraft.
3021180	3022260	I got Final Fantasy 14.
3022260	3024660	OK, I should get back into playing.
3025100	3025900	You should. It's fine.
3026100	3027380	I'm sure the expansion is going to be great.
3027380	3027980	I'm paying for it.
3028700	3029300	Oh, yeah.
3030300	3040140	All right, let's get into some more gaming news and we'll start with an update to the big headline from last week, right, Loki?
3040500	3045260	Yeah, so the Grand Theft Auto trilogy Definitive Edition is a pile of garbage.
3045260	3047380	Yeah, that's that's still a thing.
3047380	3053300	And I don't I don't know what to make of this.
3053700	3054700	It's just stupid.
3055340	3075340	So apparently they put Rockstar Games put out a post on a Rockstar news wire, whatever, saying that, hey, we are aware of the issues and, you know, there is a title update that's going on right now and it'll fix a number of the issues.
3075740	3087260	And in the meantime, we're going to put up the older classic versions of Grand Theft Auto three Vice City in San Andreas that are those are going to be available to purchase.
3087980	3096340	And then also for anybody who purchased the definitive edition will also get those from the store.
3096340	3101220	I guess they'll receive those until, I guess, June 30th, 2022.
3101980	3107300	So if you purchase the definitive edition between them, you'll get that classic version at no additional cost.
3107500	3109140	Oh, how generous of you.
3109140	3110180	Thank you.
3111540	3113700	Then, of course, they said that, you know.
3114940	3125100	The update versions, updated versions of these classic games did not launch in the state that meets our own standards of quality or the standards our fans have come to expect.
3125340	3126700	Excuse me.
3127260	3127900	Excuse me.
3127900	3141540	You're a company that develops very complicated, well polished games, and you were unaware of the quality or you didn't believe that they met your standards.
3141540	3142300	Well, guess what?
3142300	3148020	You as a company or publisher can say, yeah, that doesn't meet our standards.
3148100	3150460	We're not publishing that right now.
3150460	3152580	We're going to delay it, let it go.
3152780	3156420	But you made the decision to release it in the state that it was.
3156540	3162060	So this either tells me you're complete fucking stupid or you just don't fucking care.
3162420	3163460	Take either one.
3163460	3164340	It doesn't matter.
3164340	3164860	They don't.
3165700	3167260	It's just it's garbage.
3167500	3171620	This is ridiculous that, oh, it wasn't up to our standards.
3173500	3174660	Well, no kidding.
3174820	3180340	I mean, you obviously somebody had to have been playing it or getting updates.
3180340	3182860	You weren't completely going into this blind like, what?
3183780	3187100	It was looking like that and we just let it go out.
3188820	3191700	I don't believe that for one minute.
3191740	3201380	I also I bet the QA department, I bet the quality because there's going to be people out there that still don't get it and they're going to sit there and say, doesn't don't they have a quality assurance department?
3201860	3202940	Aren't they doing their jobs?
3202940	3205100	And yes, they do.
3205100	3206020	And they are.
3206020	3207020	But guess what?
3207020	3211740	Sometimes you report those things to the top and they go, ah, we have a minimum viable product.
3211740	3213140	We'll release it and patch it later.
3213300	3216380	That is the decision of the senior and that folks.
3216380	3216660	Yeah.
3216660	3220580	And that is not the way to release stuff nowadays.
3220580	3225820	I know it seems like, oh, well, we've got a shoddy shell of a game put out through a patch it later.
3226420	3230220	OK, well, we're going to remember that when the next game comes out.
3231420	3236660	And of course, there's still the lawsuits that they're filing against modders for different things.
3237540	3249700	So I know right now that there are they're fighting the lawsuits right now for RE3 and RE Vice City, which were reverse engineered clean room source code.
3249700	3254860	So it was basically kind of seeing how the game works and figuring it out in the back end and redoing it.
3254860	3270460	And so basically saying that, you know, any complained copying of code protected material that did occur, if any, was undertaken to allow for interoperability of the software and fixing bugs.
3272660	3281020	But such actions comprising reverse engineering are transformative use is what they're alleging, which I agree.
3281020	3288660	I think if they are coming up with completely unique code that basically runs the game in a similar manner.
3289860	3296900	Then there's not really much they can do about it unless they were actually ripping out the code from the game and popping it into theirs.
3296900	3299380	I mean, it. I don't know.
3300300	3300900	It's stupid.
3301060	3308380	As 100 Mountain Chat says, this was a side project that didn't have a huge staff, I imagine that was pushed out to get out something for the holidays.
3308700	3310460	Again, a call from the top.
3310460	3316140	And why are we so I mean, they don't have something for the holidays because they have granted auto online.
3316140	3316820	They have grants.
3316820	3318020	They're making tons of money from that.
3318020	3319340	They don't need to push this out.
3319340	3323060	How much money does this obviously that does this possibly make for them?
3323100	3330260	Didn't Switch show us that the holidays do not have to be the end all be all of video game releases?
3330260	3331180	I mean, I get it.
3331180	3332900	Yes, there is a lot of retail.
3333220	3334860	But OK, you know what?
3334860	3336820	Covid has fucked everything up.
3336820	3338900	If you have to delay it for a few months.
3339180	3340220	Oh, well.
3340220	3341580	Release it in April.
3341580	3345460	And I bet there'll be a lot of people who'd still buy it if the product is good.
3345940	3351940	I just feel like it's mind blowing to me how people literally die on the hill of getting the game out for the holiday.
3352180	3353100	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3353100	3355700	I know y'all are going to go to fiscal year.
3355700	3356900	Got to get the stocks.
3356900	3358940	Has to be out before April or doesn't go to.
3359220	3360260	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
3360260	3362460	But do you think this helped?
3362700	3365780	Do you think this is going to end up being a good thing for them at the end of the day?
3366260	3367260	Well, this is not.
3367260	3376140	It's like, look at they knew what the the studio, the quality of the studio, they had this studio do mobile versions of these games.
3376140	3383220	And then they they instead of remastering the console versions for this definitive edition,
3383500	3389300	they remastered the mobile versions, which were like adapted from the console version.
3389300	3391020	So it's like a copy of a copy.
3391660	3394620	You can't tell me that they didn't know that they had issues with it.
3394620	3401100	I mean, like, just can you not like I'm going to put the original game on one screen.
3401100	3407140	I'm going to put the piece of shit that I'm working on right now and I'm going to look at them and go, damn, that doesn't look good.
3407260	3408540	Maybe I should fix that.
3408620	3410220	Oh, someone looked at it.
3410220	3411580	Loki, someone looked at it.
3411580	3413140	It's just somebody else didn't care.
3413140	3418500	Stupid like like the rain textures that they had were like super high res for what it is like.
3418500	3420700	It shouldn't be that high level.
3421340	3424620	The texture file for that shouldn't be that big.
3424940	3427660	And they were using something ridiculously large.
3427660	3431460	I mean, even the rain, just like the opacity just need to be fixed on that.
3431500	3434900	I heard modders are actually taking care of that stuff.
3434940	3436740	I mean, it's just of course.
3436740	3437620	And it's weird, too.
3437620	3443380	It's like even and even with this, like the San Andreas rain looks like garbage.
3443380	3445380	And I think freeze rain looks like garbage.
3445380	3447780	But Vice City, not so bad.
3448540	3452820	Like, there's not even consistency between the different games that they have.
3453180	3456140	And you can't tell me it's because they're running on different engines because they're not.
3456140	3457780	They're all basically the same.
3457780	3462700	It's just if these are like graphical assets, it shouldn't matter
3463380	3468820	how, you know, they can just adjust the texture file that's being used for this.
3468820	3471100	I don't. I don't know.
3471300	3473100	It's just so stupid.
3473100	3475020	They're like, I don't want to.
3475020	3476460	And that's it. That's why.
3476780	3478540	It's just it's low effort.
3478540	3481620	It was an incredibly low effort port.
3482620	3486660	Of another port that they put in there, it's because that's what they do.
3486700	3488700	They're not going they're not going to.
3489500	3491580	I don't even know why put this out, like why?
3491580	3493740	Why even bother putting this out at this point?
3493740	3494660	Like, I don't understand.
3494660	3497700	Just put it put a sale out for your other games or something.
3498140	3501220	Like, I don't know why you need the definitive edition of this,
3501500	3505220	which is kind of where they ended up now is that they are doing a sale
3505260	3507500	on those original games or they put the original games back
3507500	3510020	after taking them down, right? Right.
3510060	3513380	Yeah, it just got I don't know. It's stupid.
3515060	3518020	It's because they thought they could print money.
3518020	3520220	And it backfired.
3520980	3523780	All right. Let's move on and talk about
3523780	3527020	this is pretty big news in the competitive fighting game circuit,
3527020	3529980	and that is, you know, of course, Nintendo has shut down a lot of,
3530340	3533540	you know, Smash Brothers tournaments because they were running on that
3533780	3535740	modded thing and so forth.
3535740	3539060	Well, very interesting development this week in a tweet from
3539660	3542380	a group of folks that organize tournaments.
3542380	3546500	Panda, who is at Panda Global on Twitter, tweeted out,
3546500	3551340	We are proud to announce our partnership with Nintendo in 2022.
3551340	3554460	Panda will be bringing the first officially licensed circuit
3554740	3558900	for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and Super Smash Brothers Melee
3559220	3560700	to North America.
3560700	3564940	That's the part that has a lot of people raising their eyebrows because
3565620	3568260	they've they they tagged Nintendo in the tweet.
3568540	3572140	They've they've given Nintendo coin or something's happened here.
3572420	3576740	And Nintendo is essentially endorsing Super Smash Brothers Melee
3576980	3580900	as a competitive platform, even though the ultimate is up there as well.
3581100	3585020	It feels like Nintendo was resisting that for a long time.
3585220	3588460	I don't know if this is because Ultimate is now finished.
3588460	3591500	I'm using my quotey fingers finished because all the DLC
3591740	3594060	is out there at this point or what the deal is.
3594380	3597500	But very fascinating, to be quite honest.
3598140	3602020	They did point out more details for this short series of events.
3602020	3606620	I'm not sure what they mean by that with cash prizes is coming very soon.
3606660	3608940	So that's that's pretty awesome.
3609660	3613980	Hmm. Yeah, just maybe they wanted the new games showcase,
3613980	3617220	and so they agreed to do the new game and the old game as well.
3617620	3620260	Yeah, which I would have which I would have figured would have been part of it.
3620460	3624740	And Mike Defton chat says this is actually huge, like so freaking huge.
3624780	3628180	Yes. But if you're in that fighting game circuit, I have seen people
3628180	3631460	who do play Smash and on a somewhat competitive level that are like kind
3631460	3635700	of tweeting like like, whoa, at this type of news that's going on.
3635700	3636940	This is a big deal.
3636940	3640540	The fact that you're going to have an official Nintendo Smash
3640540	3644780	Brothers Melee tournament in the year, assumably 2022.
3645780	3649500	You know what, 20 years almost after almost 20 years after it was released.
3649500	3650780	That is a pretty big deal.
3650780	3654100	And especially after Nintendo, you know, was shut, shutting down modders
3654340	3657460	and really kind of was perceived to anyway
3657820	3661700	really be burying melee in favor of ultimate.
3662700	3665140	So this is this is very, very interesting.
3665980	3668580	That is very specifically on their terms.
3669300	3671700	And that that honestly could be it as well.
3672580	3675300	And maybe Nintendo, to some expect, kind of realizes
3675300	3678420	they have to do this because they can't exactly stop the modders.
3678700	3682220	But if they can get a company to partner with that's willing to do cash prizes
3682460	3685340	for this, then this is the one people are going to work for.
3685780	3687860	And I think that's also a big thing.
3687860	3691700	If you're going to get a cash prize from being the best in a melee
3691700	3695060	version of this, it's in one that's Nintendo acknowledged.
3695060	3698180	Nonetheless, it's going to make it more attractive
3698660	3700500	to train to and compete to.
3700500	3702620	I'm not saying it's going to do away with mods.
3702620	3705340	You'll never you'll never do away with mods.
3705620	3708340	And there's always going to be a fan, you know, fans for that scene
3708340	3709220	and all that stuff.
3709220	3710780	But it's going to mod. Yeah.
3710780	3714100	But I think it's going to they're going to pull people away from that
3714100	3716940	in this more, quote unquote, legit thing, which I think is interesting.
3717740	3722020	SSG 100 map saying Nintendo was hesitant to get into the tournament scene.
3722260	3724980	They were shutting down a ton of tournaments until recent years.
3725180	3727780	Even now, they only mildly tolerated tournaments.
3728020	3730740	Now they're actually partnering with a legit e-sports group
3730740	3731980	to put something out.
3731980	3736060	Mike Deaf follows that up and says, yeah, Hungrybox actually got emotional
3736060	3737820	about this. Well, this is, you know,
3737820	3742060	if this is something that's been like underground for a long time
3742060	3745940	and have it's it's nice for Nintendo to kind of fucking acknowledge it.
3746220	3750820	So kudos to everybody that that everybody that stood by
3750820	3754780	that 20 year old game while everybody was saying, why are you just
3754780	3757380	why are you playing such a goddamn old game?
3757380	3759500	Get over it. Play the new shit.
3759500	3762260	For those of you guys out there that stuck with it, congratulations.
3762260	3764260	You know, you're proud of yourself.
3764260	3765540	You're getting a hug this week.
3765540	3769900	And I to some extent, I get it like the modded thing.
3770460	3773100	I kind of always understood why Nintendo shut that down.
3773100	3774300	You may not like it,
3774300	3777860	but Nintendo completely was in the legal right to shut that down.
3778500	3783460	The unmodded like local game store tournaments on melee.
3783820	3786900	Like what's what's the problem, Nintendo?
3786900	3789980	What's the problem if it bothered if it bothered you that much?
3790020	3793180	Sell copies of melee, which, by the way,
3793820	3798020	a lot of people are thinking this might lead to that is that.
3798020	3801340	Oh, now that Smash Brothers Ultimate is done
3801660	3804060	and there's this whole audience that wants to do melee
3804060	3808660	and do it competitively, let's sell them the game again on the switch.
3809580	3811780	That doesn't actually sound far off.
3811820	3816340	I. I holiday 2022.
3816660	3819740	What do you bet? Now the game on the switch or sell them
3819740	3824380	a subscription to Nintendo online services is going to include that game in there.
3824380	3825860	No, no, they're not going to.
3825860	3828100	No, no, no. They won't Netflix the GameCube games.
3828100	3829780	They're going to sell them separately.
3829780	3830740	But you know what?
3830740	3836900	If this opens the door, the pop, if this opens the door to F-Zero GX
3837980	3841220	being also one of those games that comes out on a GameCube thing,
3841900	3843900	I'm going to allow it.
3844740	3848500	That's the reality. All right.
3848500	3851300	Pod culture and chat says melee ultimate remastered.
3851300	3853660	See, I think the community would reject that immediately
3854020	3856820	if if it is not frame by frame.
3856820	3858140	Perfect to the original.
3858140	3860220	The community will reject it.
3860220	3861620	The definitive edition.
3861620	3865820	Yeah. Now I change how it plays ready to work on another game.
3866060	3871460	Yeah. Vicarious visions before they were purchased by an evil company.
3871780	3876660	Did what was considered to be a pretty relatively good remaster
3876660	3878900	where you just hit a button to toggle between the two.
3879100	3882220	If that's the direction Nintendo wants to go with it. Cool.
3882220	3884620	But yeah, it's.
3886580	3888620	All right. Let's move on to our soccer.
3888620	3889580	How about more rumors?
3889580	3892180	We love rumors on Thanksgiving week when the news is slower.
3893020	3895660	Well, CD Projekt,
3896860	3900740	there was like a little bit of a leak out there
3901060	3903180	that had a trailer.
3904380	3907820	It was actually included in a trailer for Cyberpunk 2077
3908500	3914180	that there would be links to using Xbox Game Pass
3914180	3916700	and it would be available via the game pass.
3917020	3919020	And they're like, nope, we didn't do that.
3919020	3921380	That's a rumor. Stop.
3921380	3925140	And that actually direct quote says there are no game pass plans
3925140	3927260	for Cyberpunk 2077.
3927780	3933820	But it was there, you know, there was the mention.
3933900	3935340	It makes me think that at some point
3935340	3938660	they actually did have some sort of discussion about it.
3940900	3944860	The DLC delays are also not coming out.
3945340	3948460	Well, sorry, the DLC is for this year has been delayed until next year.
3949660	3951740	The new titles that are coming out for
3952860	3955580	Xbox Game Pass will actually just for this month is Grand Theft Auto
3955580	3957180	San Andreas, the Definitive Edition.
3957180	3960060	It takes two Forza Horizon five and Evil Genius two.
3962820	3965500	Nice. Yeah.
3965500	3968540	I'd grab Cyberpunk if it came out on Game Pass.
3969460	3971700	I wish it would. I get it.
3971700	3973540	You know why? Why?
3973540	3975180	It's not your kind of game.
3975180	3977700	Oh, I don't have the Xbox. Oh.
3977700	3980620	That's why I would not, because I cannot.
3980620	3983380	I'm not I'm also completely not mad about it.
3984380	3987420	I still don't have a PlayStation five, and I kind of want to remedy that.
3987420	3988940	But I'm at the point where I'm like, OK,
3990100	3992220	maybe they'll do a pro next year.
3992220	3994900	But the reality is when Final Fantasy 16 is dated,
3994900	3997500	I will get a PlayStation five period. So.
3998340	4003620	All right. If you can, if you can find one, that's always the the major caveat.
4003780	4005740	Don't remind me. All right.
4005740	4008220	Let's move on, Loki.
4009740	4013260	So basically, according to Tom Henderson,
4013620	4017740	DICE had pitched Battlefield three, but it was rejected
4018740	4022180	by EA due to the cost of using the Star Wars license.
4022820	4027340	I got turned down because it takes 20 percent more sales to make the same money.
4027740	4031020	So instead, they're going to work on another Battlefield game.
4032620	4036060	Like Battlefield 2042, the one that just got released
4036060	4040420	and also has the most is the worst reviewed game on Steam.
4041420	4043660	That that series.
4043660	4047340	You know, the the battlefield Call of Duty, I guess.
4049260	4052260	Tiger Claw on chat says, probably because EA got burned
4052260	4055460	by what happened with Battlefront two. Well, whose fault was that?
4056860	4060340	Whose fault was that was your fault and not for,
4060620	4064620	you know, not embracing the wonderful world of loot boxes.
4064900	4067020	Don't you like surprises?
4067380	4070220	I hate how disconnected executives
4070220	4072100	are at these companies from fucking reality.
4072100	4074060	It blows my mind.
4074060	4076700	It blows that was a requirement to being an executive.
4078980	4081540	Any three VL in chat says current Battlefield is buggy.
4081540	4083180	Oh, yeah, we've been hearing about that.
4083180	4086180	I mean, that's not the type of game I play, but I've definitely been hearing about that.
4087340	4090140	Another thing I've been hearing about quite a bit this week
4090620	4093060	has to do with a little company called Stream Labs.
4094060	4098740	Oh, boy. So, oh, boy.
4099380	4103540	There's a lot that Stream Labs really got a good dragging,
4103540	4108700	a hair pulling on social media this week, and it started with plagiarism
4110180	4112420	accusations, basically.
4112420	4117260	There they've been working on a product that's very similar to Lightstream,
4117260	4121940	which is where you can stream without the need of a capture card.
4122020	4126300	I think it just kind of pulls from like a I don't know how it actually works.
4126300	4129580	I don't know if it's going through your mobile device or streaming like on
4129940	4134620	like your I think you're streaming it on your device to like a server
4134620	4137940	that then, you know, you you go through and broadcast on.
4137940	4139740	I haven't really had to look into it
4139740	4142100	because I am fortunate enough to have a capture card.
4142780	4144460	It's a thing that does stuff.
4144460	4147100	But Stream Labs was going to launch their own version of it.
4147100	4151420	And boy, oh boy, did Lightstream call them out on their bullshit.
4152060	4155420	They they put out a tweet that was like when the other kid copies your homework.
4155420	4159460	And I'm telling you, the Stream Labs launch page was like, copy, copy
4159460	4161740	down to the testament quotes.
4161740	4165500	And of course, Stream Labs put out this apology that was like it was
4165900	4168980	something that was supposed to be a test page
4168980	4172300	that was not supposed to go into production well. Right.
4172740	4174580	Well, but all right.
4174580	4175980	I am going to take a step back.
4175980	4177740	Change the text and change the fonts.
4178260	4180180	Actually, I will tell you,
4180180	4185900	I have copied and pasted the layout for the sake of setting up my layout.
4186420	4189460	I will typically not copy and paste text
4190540	4193180	and just do like the lorem ipsum text.
4193220	4196220	But I I'm not going to fault.
4196860	4199140	That is a statement.
4199140	4202660	But I am going to say it's fucking lazy on their designers
4202660	4204860	part to have done it verbatim.
4204860	4210140	Well, and also like it's not the fact is it's that coupled with the fact
4210540	4214500	that Stream Labs is essentially building off a knockoff software
4214780	4218140	of the page they stole that that isn't I think the problem
4218140	4221100	is that it's those two things together that make it really ugly.
4221260	4224740	If they knocked off some other person's website for this product,
4224740	4227700	then, you know, they're still kind of, you know, being lazy.
4227700	4231780	But at least they showed that there were multiple sources of inspiration
4231940	4233860	and not just one.
4233860	4237300	The other problem is then, oh, my God, the floodgates opened up.
4237460	4242620	So then OBS sent out a tweet this week that was like, yeah.
4242620	4245500	So we asked while we're spilling tea. Yeah.
4245740	4249100	What's while we're doing a dragging while we're doing a public,
4249380	4251700	you know, yoinking of Stream Labs,
4252300	4256900	we asked them not to use OBS in their name and they did it anyway. OOP.
4258420	4260340	In response, they trademarked it.
4260340	4261940	Yeah. Oh, that was the other.
4261940	4263780	Oh, that was really shady, too.
4263780	4267820	In response, Stream Labs sent out a lovely little white text
4267820	4269980	on a black background tweet,
4269980	4272260	which is this is the part that blows my mind.
4272380	4274860	What they wrote is big enough for an actual tweet,
4275220	4277700	but they decided to do the white text on black background.
4277700	4280820	OK, go off, because they probably copied it from somebody else.
4280820	4282980	They do a scream saying
4284380	4287100	it's it's done for effect.
4287740	4291300	We are taking immediate action to remove OBS from our name.
4291300	4295260	Stream Labs OBS is built on top of the OBS open source platform.
4295500	4299300	Stream Labs OBS is also open source and our code is publicly available.
4299460	4303180	We take responsibility for our actions and will support the community.
4303660	4308100	I mean, this is the equivalent of like that scene from Game of Thrones
4308100	4311300	where she's having to parade naked through the town
4311300	4314260	and everybody's ringing the bell going shame, shame.
4314500	4316580	That is what's happening to Stream Labs right now.
4316580	4320660	And it's it just it just makes it feel like their entire business
4320660	4323140	is built on copying other people's homework.
4324620	4327580	But the first time that's happened, I've been trying to
4328260	4332340	when you're entangled, though, in the Stream Labs ecosystem.
4333460	4335980	Disentangling yourself is a pain in the ass.
4336140	4338900	Yeah, because I'm having to do that right now.
4338900	4342100	I've already, you know, my personal merch store away from it,
4342820	4345460	you know, which honestly, we'll talk about that offline,
4345460	4346620	but it was really easy to do.
4346620	4350380	But, you know, all of my because I use cloud bot, you know,
4351100	4354500	changing everything over is not easy and they kind of make it that way.
4356580	4360020	Elgato also dragged them because I believe Stream Labs
4360020	4363340	is launching an app that basically does the same thing as a stream deck.
4363900	4368460	So, yeah, everybody's ringing their bells like now is the time.
4368460	4371220	I think I think Festivus came early this year
4371220	4374900	because everyone's airing their grievances against Stream Labs.
4376780	4378500	Interesting side effect
4378500	4381300	that hits close to home here at Orange Lounge Radio
4381300	4384060	and Vogue Network, where we broadcast every Sunday night.
4385380	4388940	We had a year agreement through Stream Labs Space.
4388980	4390900	Well, not agreement because it wasn't like a contract or anything,
4390900	4393420	but basically we bought a year of Stream Labs Pro
4393660	4395260	so that we could sell the merchandise.
4395260	4397260	You know, I always plug the shop at the end of the show.
4398100	4402060	That contract was set to be renewed on the sorry, not contract,
4402060	4405940	but you know, the agreement agreement was set to be renewed on Friday.
4406820	4411900	Bobby made an executive decision, which I supported, to not renew the agreement.
4412500	4416100	Henceforth, there is no Vogue Network shop anymore.
4416100	4418460	Actually, my understanding is it is still there.
4419100	4422260	However, I cannot endorse it because I don't know
4422260	4424300	if we will actually make money off of it at this point.
4424300	4427620	So I'm not going to be sharing that link right now.
4427860	4431300	That's why Dark Soccer hinted we need to talk offline,
4431300	4434980	because an interesting sort of thing, the timer timer came up on Stream Labs.
4435220	4437660	We have opted, you know what?
4437660	4439620	Y'all are messy.
4439620	4441860	We don't need to do messy.
4441860	4445100	So we're going to we miss seeing this without y'all.
4445460	4447740	And I think you're on the right track, Dark Soccer,
4447740	4449740	when you talk about untangling a little bit.
4449740	4453380	So we're going to move the merch store somewhere else
4453620	4456300	and we're going to be doing stream elements.
4456540	4460140	Bobby is doing a test tonight on stream elements
4460700	4463540	to make sure that a lot of the stuff that's kind of magic
4463540	4464740	that runs behind the scenes,
4464740	4467860	such as the bits and subs that scroll on the bottom
4467860	4470020	so people get their shout outs and all that.
4470020	4472620	He's actually running a test right now during tonight
4472620	4475380	to see if it's everything's cool, like nothing breaks or whatever.
4475540	4480060	And we are looking at making the motion to change over to stream elements,
4480300	4483260	at least for that component after this week.
4484020	4487900	The hardest part that I see with all of that are because, you know,
4487900	4492180	I have my my shout commands.
4493020	4493940	Not my shout commands.
4493940	4496100	I mean, those I think I can move over pretty easy
4496100	4498220	if I use Chrome because there's a tool that does it.
4498940	4501380	But the ones that I'm really the most concerned about
4501380	4504460	are going to be like my sound alerts.
4506220	4509180	That I set up in slobs streamlabs ODS,
4509540	4513100	which thankfully they're changing that name, but it doesn't work with stadia.
4513500	4517060	And I'm not the only person who notices how buggy their freaking app is
4517060	4518780	and what a resource hog it is.
4518780	4522220	Yeah, I, I tried I use it just for setting stuff up.
4522380	4525860	I tried slobs for like five seconds because I will admit
4525860	4528780	they have some really nice built in templates.
4529220	4531580	Now, of course, when everybody has access to those templates,
4531700	4533140	you don't look so unique.
4533140	4535660	But it it was not running efficiently.
4535860	4536980	Like I was getting frame skips.
4536980	4539180	It was not running well on my computer, so I went back to OBS.
4539180	4541460	Like it was like I think I maybe did one test stream in that.
4541460	4543540	And I was like, nah, this isn't for me.
4543660	4547580	It was the only way that I could possibly use chat bot because I'm on a Mac.
4548020	4550820	I am proud of being on a Mac, but.
4551820	4554500	They don't make chat bot chat bot for for Mac,
4554500	4557660	and since I'm on an M1, I can't run it through crossover.
4558260	4561580	So or or even emulated in wine.
4561620	4563860	So I have to use cloud bot.
4563860	4567860	And as it is, I'm going to be going over to whatever
4568860	4571940	stream elements users or go to nightbot like a bunch of people do.
4571940	4576140	So but yeah, if anyone doesn't think that there's anything
4576180	4579620	if you're a new streamer and you only think that it's streamlabs,
4580060	4581620	you've got alternatives.
4581620	4585700	Even Twitch has their own stream thing that you can use as well.
4585700	4587580	That I think might be back, by the way.
4587580	4589980	Oh, I think it might be built on top of OBS.
4589980	4592140	I can't remember, but there it is built on OBS.
4592140	4594620	Yeah, there are plenty of options out there.
4594620	4595980	Just so folks know.
4595980	4599180	Anyway, and when I'll say one last thing about stream elements
4599380	4601780	for other streamers out there, they offer
4601780	4604420	um, uh,
4604420	4607420	sponsored streaming opportunities like left and right.
4607660	4610140	Oh, neat. Yeah. Yeah.
4610140	4611940	I you know, we're going to look into that.
4611940	4615060	I do really like the idea that their merch shop
4615060	4617740	allows you to give discounts to people who subscribe.
4617740	4619740	I kind of love that.
4619740	4622300	But I know you really enjoy the quality of the merch
4622300	4624260	that the store you've been working with has been putting out.
4624260	4626380	So we'll figure it out. We'll come we'll figure out.
4626940	4631620	But either way, you can actually do broader coupons with spring.
4631660	4633300	I think. But yeah, offline.
4633300	4636220	But either way, sorry, y'all.
4636340	4640020	But the shop is closed just in time for the holiday shopping season.
4640020	4641460	Love that for us.
4641460	4644540	But it'll come back bigger and better as soon as we can.
4644540	4646260	So there you go.
4646900	4648740	Let's see. I also want to point out,
4648740	4652100	Dark Tetsuya in chat said, good to know you'll move the shop elsewhere.
4652100	4654340	Oh, yeah, we're not going to we don't want to get rid of ways
4654340	4658540	for you guys to help us financially pay for things like stream labs
4658540	4660220	that we end up canceling.
4660220	4661700	Hello, we like money.
4661700	4663580	I mean, we like keeping the show afloat.
4663580	4666340	Yeah, exactly. Running a business takes a lot of money.
4666340	4669500	And again, we really, really want to get back into live conventions
4669500	4671180	and all that good stuff. Anyway,
4671180	4673980	Dark Tetsuya says haven't been able to get a shirt or anything just yet
4673980	4676820	for various reasons, but hopefully by the time it finds a new home,
4676820	4679380	I'll be able to. I'm hoping in the next month or so,
4679380	4683540	we have this all figured if if that I I bet we're talking about this
4683540	4686420	in a week or two, which is we're going to miss
4686420	4688260	we're going to miss the biggest shopping day of the year.
4688260	4691940	Oh, well, sorry, guys. All right.
4691940	4694900	Let's move on. For the record, if I do recall correctly,
4694900	4697380	I think that you can have a limited number of merch
4697380	4699580	that you can share through the free version.
4699580	4702220	Oh, that's cool, because having a merch shop,
4702220	4703980	they they make money off of it regardless.
4703980	4705780	Oh, they sure do. Of course they do.
4705780	4707540	Yes. So if I do recall correctly,
4707540	4711580	you just have fewer things you can have on your storefront.
4711580	4716740	All righty, let's move on and let's get back into games and less drama.
4716740	4723860	Dark Sakura. Well, general good guy all around Phil Spencer,
4723860	4729780	he has come out on record saying that he believes that a large focus
4729780	4734300	on video game preservation in the industry is a good idea
4734300	4739060	that he hopes to turn to emulation to preserve these games.
4739060	4743100	I'll read the quote. My hope and I think I have to present it that way
4743100	4746980	as of now is as an industry would work on legal emulation
4746980	4750420	that allowed modern hardware to run any within reason,
4750420	4757020	older executable, allowing someone to play any game there.
4757020	4763020	And there is some backwards compatibility in a relatively limited fashion.
4763020	4767500	Nintendo certainly, I think, has been the leader at this
4767500	4774780	with their online library of the NES, Genesis, all that stuff up there.
4774780	4780340	Xbox just had 70 games added to its backwards compatibility list.
4780340	4786860	So it's good to see that sort of dedication to keeping the old up
4786860	4790020	with the new so that people can see where their games came from.
4790020	4791380	I think it's a great idea.
4791380	4795060	When on top of that, we're also dealing with the 20th anniversary of Xbox,
4795060	4803300	which my baking buddy, Seamus Blackley, has been posting about.
4803300	4807260	It's been really neat watching the old pictures
4807260	4810940	and seeing the old ads pop up on my Twitter feed.
4810940	4813540	But yeah, huh?
4813540	4816620	I was just going to say, good on Phil Spencer for kind of recognizing
4816620	4819020	this is an issue in the industry and trying to do something about it.
4819020	4823660	Obviously, Microsoft did an about face with its own stance on emulation,
4823660	4827220	but I think in large part that's due to Phil Spencer coming on board,
4827220	4828900	you know, and really driving that.
4828900	4830300	So that's a great thing.
4830300	4832740	And I bet Phil Spencer would love it
4833260	4837980	if other platforms might make their way over to Xbox and so forth.
4838420	4839060	We'll see, though.
4839060	4843420	Of course, they had the opportunity with Game Room and decided to let that go.
4843420	4845540	But again, that was not under Phil Spencer's call.
4845540	4850220	So I will back off the attack dogs on that one because I bitch about it every week.
4851220	4854300	We don't blame him for the idiocy of others.
4854300	4856380	No, we don't. We don't. We do not.
4856780	4859540	But good. This is a good stance and promising.
4859540	4861620	I hope it moves, keeps moving in the right direction.
4862300	4863980	I'm happy to hear it.
4863980	4866540	There's really a second half to this, which Loki has,
4866540	4868660	and that is you kind of brought up the 20 years of Xbox
4868660	4871340	and there's there's even more, right, Loki?
4871340	4872980	Yes. Lots of exciting stuff.
4872980	4876740	So they had announced
4876740	4881060	that there's going to be 70 plus classic games that are going to be coming to Xbox.
4881780	4884860	Even some more with performance boosts as well.
4885220	4889500	So lots more backwards compatible games of that.
4889500	4892380	I mean, you know, they've got several games from
4893060	4896300	pretty much the whole series of Fear is on there.
4896460	4900260	Dead or Alive, you know, a few games of that beautiful Katamari.
4900700	4901380	That's pretty cool.
4904060	4906020	Then what else?
4906020	4907380	Oh, and Times players, too.
4907380	4908780	That's that's an excellent game.
4910460	4912980	And then, hey, surprise.
4913380	4915860	We're putting out Halo Infinite's multiplayer early.
4917100	4918700	You'll have to wait until December eight.
4918700	4920260	And apparently it's excellent.
4920260	4922700	So that was a pretty cool surprise that they had.
4923220	4926660	Then along with that, you can now
4927380	4931460	with the Xbox one, Xbox Series X and S, you can use Xbox
4931460	4934340	Cloud Gaming if you have Game Pass Ultimate as well.
4934780	4935700	So that's pretty awesome.
4935700	4939260	You don't have to necessarily do that now to a mobile or smartphone device.
4939980	4941580	You can actually use your console,
4941580	4945460	which I think is the direction that they wanted to go with that stuff.
4945460	4949860	And also, it's nice when you want to, say, play a game like,
4950380	4952700	I don't know, Flight Simulator or something like that.
4952740	4955020	That would normally be a really large download.
4955020	4957260	You can just kind of stream it.
4958260	4960540	So pretty cool.
4963060	4964460	Sorry, my sister is texting me
4964460	4966180	as if she doesn't know that I have a show right now.
4966180	4967420	That's why I keep looking at my phone.
4967420	4973700	Sorry, guys. But yes, I thought the Xbox event was pretty cool.
4973700	4976700	I love that they have still enhanced the backwards compatibility.
4976700	4980180	I know they've pretty much definitively said this time, this is it.
4980380	4983220	There's no we're not doing any more work on backwards compatibility.
4983220	4984460	This is this is it.
4984460	4986340	And that's OK.
4986340	4988140	It's fair, obviously. Yeah, it's fair.
4988140	4991620	I mean, yes, I'm sure we can all think of games that are still missing DDR.
4992380	4995020	It's still like it's still a lot.
4995060	4997020	I mean, but yeah, DDR would be cool.
4997020	5000860	But Jet Set Radio Future in chat, I see being named, of course.
5002860	5004660	So that's a bummer.
5004900	5007740	Yeah, but they still got like quite a bit in there,
5007740	5009980	and at least they're putting effort into it.
5009980	5012020	So, you know, props for that.
5013460	5016020	But yeah, I don't know. I get it.
5017020	5022300	So, yeah, also, I did I didn't mention it during my gaming week,
5022300	5026140	but I did lightly check out that shock Halo Infinite drop that they did.
5026660	5029820	I did spend the hundred gigs of my bandwidth to download it
5029820	5031620	because we've been doing really good on bandwidth this month.
5031620	5036300	So I downloaded that Halo Infinite preview and I got through the tutorial,
5036300	5041620	at least now I did not know that there was a PvE or player versus bots mode.
5041620	5044180	And Bobby was telling me about that before on his show tonight.
5044380	5045700	So I definitely will check that out
5045700	5049900	because I'm still a little bit like like that Doom difficulty.
5050020	5053780	Mommy, I'm too scared to die when it comes to Halo online right now.
5054100	5059380	But I think I think the PvE thing Bobby was talking about is good.
5059580	5063500	That's how I enjoyed playing other games, too, is PvE.
5063500	5067860	But also, thankfully, now that I'm super into Dead by Daylight
5067860	5071820	and all this stuff, it's kind of softened me a little bit on playing with strangers,
5071820	5075700	even though it also still annoys the shit out of me sometimes like,
5076500	5079540	you know, when you're solo queuing and you get in a match against a Freddy
5079660	5083220	and everybody else decides to die on first hook because it's Freddy like
5084300	5086300	annoying. All right.
5086300	5089780	Anyway, but I won't I won't talk more about that.
5089780	5094220	Instead, I will talk about another old company.
5095300	5096740	Trying to do new things.
5096740	5100340	You know what, we give this company a lot of shit, and to be fair,
5100340	5102620	I kind of think it's justified most of the time.
5102900	5105740	But this sounds kind of interesting.
5105740	5108020	And it's Atari we're going to talk about.
5108420	5111700	Atari is going to be rolling out something called Atari XP.
5112020	5116340	This is not like an individual gamer product, but it's an initiative
5116580	5120940	for retro gaming enthusiasts, collectors, where you can get actual Atari
5120940	5123900	game cartridges from the 70s and 80s.
5124420	5128300	But these are games that didn't really end up happening.
5128820	5131660	They're either things that probably showed up on a flashback console
5131660	5133580	or just straight up never happened.
5133580	5135740	I think all of these showed up on a flashback at some point.
5135740	5140900	But Yars Return, Aquaventure and Saboteur.
5140900	5143100	I know I've heard of Saboteur and the Yars one before.
5143380	5146940	Those games are going to be the first three that will be through this service.
5147420	5149740	They are going to stay focused on Atari.
5149900	5152340	Twenty six hundred fifty two hundred seventy eight hundred.
5153020	5156100	Not like Jaguar and the stuff that came after that stuff.
5156540	5158860	No Tempest 3000.
5158860	5159940	That would be rad.
5160220	5163380	Yeah, I know. Well, who knows if these things sell really well.
5163380	5165340	We've had plenty of other temps.
5167980	5171220	So anyway, these limited editions are newly manufactured.
5171220	5174460	These are not old cartridges that were like dug out of landfill or something.
5174460	5176620	These are being printed new.
5177100	5181540	There will be an instruction manual and other bonus material, a collectible
5181540	5185100	pin and a badge, a certificate of authenticity, and you can even get
5185100	5189580	a digital copy to play on your Atari VCS like anyone else.
5190460	5192140	Come on now. But cute.
5192900	5197620	They're also saying one thousand nine hundred and eighty three copies of these
5198060	5200620	to signify the year they would have been released.
5201580	5202860	Now, ready for the Whopper?
5203380	5208180	These games will go for one hundred and fifty dollars over at Atari XP dot com.
5209140	5213620	But there will be standard editions cartridge only that are fifty dollars.
5213820	5217740	They are planning on doing more with Atari XP, including unreleased titles,
5217900	5222740	rare games, improved versions of classic games with refined
5222740	5224380	mechanics and graphics.
5224820	5227700	Can you imagine a good E.T.?
5227700	5230740	Yes, except they're never going to get the license to do E.T.
5230740	5234860	again. They can't do that unless somebody wrote a real good contract
5235020	5238740	in nineteen eighty two or whatever that was, unless someone wrote a real good
5238740	5241060	contract. Atari is not going to be able to do another E.T..
5241060	5243660	The thing is, is that there's also other companies that have done
5244580	5245860	repros of prototypes.
5245860	5248740	Yeah. Like, you know, I've got a few of them.
5248740	5253540	Like I have actually have a baby Pac-Man prototype.
5255700	5258620	Tempest, you know, lots of stuff like like that.
5259700	5261260	And they sell them for a lot less.
5261260	5262940	So I don't know what they what they think.
5262940	5266100	It said that it is maybe that it is official and licensed.
5266100	5268140	I don't know. Interesting.
5268140	5270460	Bobby points out that some of these are homebrew.
5270460	5275500	I thought Saboteur in particular was like just an unreleased Atari game.
5275700	5279500	I didn't realize that Yars return or I'm sorry, I already forgot the name
5279500	5280660	was was a homebrew thing.
5280660	5283620	But Bobby says it came out in 2005.
5283900	5286220	They're just selling people's homebrews.
5286220	5290860	Well, now maybe that's how the homebrews were able to be legitimized a little bit,
5290860	5293260	I guess. I mean, they were kind of making it on Atari's IP.
5293460	5296180	But hey, hopefully both ends are getting coin.
5296180	5297860	Hopefully the homebrew makers get the coin.
5297860	5301380	Atari's getting the coin because there's a lot of coin when you charge one hundred
5301380	5305020	fifty dollars. So that's what's kind of interesting.
5305140	5308020	So we talk about stealing the other ideas earlier.
5308020	5309940	We talked about stream labs and all that.
5309940	5312980	Atari is basically doing limited run games.
5313540	5317620	But I sort of think that's the wheelhouse they should be in.
5317860	5322620	And whether well, whether you agree this is the right price or not is all this stuff.
5323100	5327540	I think it's better than that joke of a new console they put out.
5327620	5330140	Not that long ago, although the hotel thing does sound rad.
5330820	5332500	That's not what I'm making that sound about.
5333100	5339860	It's that they're they're not really imitating limited run because.
5341100	5343660	Limited run doesn't have the monopoly on doing that either.
5343740	5348260	And they didn't copy the they didn't copy the website as far as we know.
5348500	5354380	But I mean, a limited run of a game is just that limited printing of a game and
5354380	5355740	companies have been doing that forever.
5355740	5359580	So I don't know if that's the best comparison that I would have made.
5359580	5363740	Well, that's fair. The reason why I bring it up is because the limited run games has
5363740	5366060	had such success with it.
5366060	5371340	And I think I think it showed somebody at Atari, whoever's calling the shots there,
5371540	5376700	this could work because it's working over here for these guys and their NES replicas
5376700	5378140	of Mayman 2 and all this stuff.
5378340	5383580	So that's why I put it that way, is that, you know, yeah, yeah.
5384060	5388580	So anyway, Bobby also humble bragging a little bit, saying I bought Saboteur from
5388580	5392900	Howard Scott Warshaw directly and it's signed back in 2004.
5393100	5396020	Can we just give it up here for Howard Scott Warshaw right now?
5396020	5398700	He was a true genius of the 80s Atari games.
5398940	5403060	He is. And of course, I'm sure a lot of you guys remember the old commercials on that
5403060	5404780	network where he used to brag.
5404820	5407700	He made one of the best Atari 2600 games ever made.
5407700	5410420	Yars revenge and one of the worst E.T.
5410780	5412780	But you all know the documentaries are out there.
5412820	5418980	What Howard Scott Warshaw was given six weeks and a bag of cocaine, allegedly, to make
5418980	5422180	E.T. happen. And you got what you got.
5422180	5424500	You talk. Oh, my God.
5424740	5430180	The broke ass game to make the holiday season is been a recurring theme in this
5430180	5434620	industry since literally eighty two, eighty three, whatever that E.T.
5434620	5436780	game came out. And here we are.
5437660	5442220	Twenty twenty one and take two still hasn't figured it out.
5442780	5449740	Orange right says E.T., if it wasn't crunched, I mean, but back in the day, it really was
5449740	5452020	one person that made a lot of those games.
5452020	5454940	It really was. Bonds 006 says, but he did it.
5454940	5457620	And that's why in many ways, E.T.
5457620	5459580	is actually kind of awesome.
5459740	5460940	Yes, I said it.
5461140	5466300	E.T. is actually kind of awesome because he threw that together in six weeks.
5466540	5468740	What have you done with the last six weeks?
5468740	5475700	I know I don't have a great answer for that, so I just I just think that's a great story
5475700	5476780	with that for what it is.
5477100	5482860	So, all right. I think a great segue into our next segment.
5482860	5483980	So let me roll the bump.
5483980	5501980	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out
5501980	5503700	a classic and tell you about it.
5504100	5506860	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5508460	5512660	And dark soccer is going to tell you the game, and I'm going to warn you, I'm having to do this
5512660	5514100	a little differently tonight.
5514100	5514940	Apologies.
5514940	5519460	I neglected to rip the B roll in advance because I had a little bit of a busy Sunday.
5519780	5521300	But I think we got it.
5521300	5523300	So dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5524020	5530220	The classic game of the week is Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which I played the shit out of.
5530940	5533260	I even remember
5534500	5539780	Tiara visiting once and us playing through this game and having such a great time with it.
5540340	5550100	But anyway, it's by the company that acquired another company that's currently having some
5550100	5552260	problems right now, and I didn't realize it when I picked it.
5553700	5561500	But it came out in 2006, it was an action role-playing game developed by Raven Software
5561500	5566900	for PS2, PS3, Xbox and Xbox 360, published by They Who Shall Not Be Named.
5567900	5574780	It did have a port to PSP and Wii by Vicarious Visions, and then to Windows by Benox.
5575260	5580980	There is a sort of Game Boy Advance version by Barking Lizards, and a remastered version
5580980	5589260	developed by Zoe Mode for Windows, PS4, Xbox One that came out 10 years later in 2016.
5590260	5599140	So it is set in its own, I guess, part of the Marvel multiverse, where you have different
5599140	5602380	heroes, different villains, different supporting characters.
5603380	5608020	And it's very similar to X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2 Rise of Apocalypse that you
5608020	5615060	have, you choose your different team from the roster there and different story objectives
5615060	5615580	that you go.
5615980	5622060	For this particular one, you have to defeat Doctor Doom and the Masters of Evil.
5623860	5625420	It was a really good game.
5625420	5626940	I mean, it was really fun.
5626940	5633900	You had, like, just the best banter that went in in the game.
5635300	5637660	It was so much fun.
5637660	5642060	I mean, I felt, you know, Ultimate Alliance 2 was really good.
5642060	5648140	Ultimate Alliance 3 was kind of, even though it was done by Team Ninja, but we won't talk
5648140	5648660	about that yet.
5649860	5656340	Maybe in 2029, because that'll be 10 years after that.
5657140	5664820	Anyway, you start from a cast of over 22 playable characters, although some of them are
5664820	5667140	not available when you start, you have to unlock them.
5667980	5676540	You also get bonuses if you form certain groups, like putting Avengers together, Defenders,
5676540	5685140	Fantastic Four, X-Men, Marvel Knights, you know, and then you have to do these different
5685140	5686420	missions as you keep going.
5687420	5690140	And you can switch between your characters.
5690140	5691420	They've got special moves.
5691420	5692620	You've got different things going.
5692620	5694620	It's very much a masher game, though.
5694620	5695980	I will be perfectly honest.
5698140	5703940	There's also some differences in some of the other versions.
5703940	5712340	For Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Marketplace, you had a Heroes pack that gave you a few other
5712340	5718940	Marvel characters and you had a Villains pack, you know, and they came with different achievements.
5718940	5721140	The Gold Edition has all of that in there.
5722140	5725340	Of course, you know, if the game is successful, they're going to do 50 million different versions
5725340	5725740	of the game.
5726340	5734340	The Wii version has motion specific controls and they also have different missions and
5734340	5738340	added in a couple other characters, as did the PC version.
5738340	5743340	It has intuitive mouse controls, but it also will work with the game pad.
5743340	5748340	And then, of course, the Game Boy Advance version is just the sort of teeny version of it.
5748340	5750340	The game is beautiful.
5750340	5754340	You are traveling all through the Marvel universe.
5754940	5761940	You go to Asgard, you go to space, you hang out with Galactus for a hot minute.
5761940	5765940	It's pretty, pretty awesome.
5765940	5769940	You've got so many different bosses in the game.
5769940	5776940	I like to pride myself on my comic book knowledge, although I will say that most of my knowledge
5776940	5781940	has to basically stay in the X-Men universe, but there's some pretty, pretty cool stuff.
5782540	5785540	And there's other characters that are just in cut scenes that's still a really good nod to.
5788540	5790540	It got really positive reviews.
5792540	5799540	For Metacritic, the initial console releases were over 80%.
5799540	5803540	Reviewers and magazines gave it really good reviews.
5803540	5806540	And like I said, there's been sequels.
5806540	5808540	There was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
5809140	5814140	That was also pretty fun, but it was the stupid Civil War storyline,
5814140	5818140	which I hated the Civil War storyline from the comics, I won't go there.
5818140	5822140	And then there was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 The Black Order.
5822140	5827140	That was done by Team Ninja, and it's a reboot of the series,
5827140	5832140	so it's a different continuity from the first game, but it has kind of similar lines.
5832740	5838740	To this day, it's still a very solid, easy-to-play game.
5838740	5841740	It's got great story to it.
5844740	5846740	It really is a lot of fun.
5846740	5851740	I kind of want to hook up my Xbox again and play it,
5851740	5855740	just because I've had it kind of on my mind for a little bit.
5855740	5860740	It's really good, and I recommend if you haven't played it, why the fuck not?
5862740	5865740	Especially playing as Deadpool.
5867740	5870740	Sounds like there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
5870740	5875740	Very loved choice by chat, it sounds like.
5875740	5882740	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, you have to remember the game came out after the last two games that were X-Men Legends 1 and 2.
5882740	5884740	That's what I said.
5884740	5886740	Questbuster says, replayability was great.
5886740	5890740	There was loot, unlockable characters, and a skill system to keep you coming back.
5891340	5894340	S.J. 100 Matt says, I got it on PS2 in storage somewhere.
5894340	5899340	S.J. 100 Matt also says, very button-mashy, but so much fun.
5899340	5903340	Oh yeah, this was a stress relief game for me. I had a lot of fun.
5903340	5911340	And yes, I did mention right at the beginning that it was based off of the same for X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2.
5911340	5913340	Ah, gotcha.
5913340	5915340	I may have snuck in a potty bit.
5915940	5921940	Alright, awesome, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5921940	5928940	So, let's get back into talking about some news, and we'll go now to rapid fire news.
5928940	5930940	Loki, why don't you start us off?
5930940	5936940	Yeah, so we got news, and I'm not surprised because of all the backlash it received, but
5936940	5941940	Saints Row has been delayed now to August of 2022.
5942540	5947540	And it's, you know, basically to give them more development time, which I'm totally cool with.
5947540	5953540	Let's let them take the time and make it good, and maybe come up with some different characters that they have in the game.
5953540	5955540	That's a tall order.
5955540	5959540	I'll give it a chance, I'll give it a chance. Actually, the gameplay looked pretty good.
5959540	5967540	Still not sold on the characters yet, but if they have good writing and a good story behind them, maybe I'll come around.
5967540	5969540	No promises.
5970140	5971140	No promises, yeah.
5971140	5982140	Something that's actually very insanely cool is this brand new Disney World DLC pack that's available for Minecraft Bedrock.
5982140	5988140	And what it adds is Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom, and it's a full park.
5988140	5994140	You can actually have all of the cast members sign a book, you have an autograph book that you can go through and stuff.
5994140	5998140	And all of the rides are interactable.
5998740	6003740	You can actually ride all the rides, and it's extremely detailed with the copyright music and everything.
6003740	6011740	They even went so far, if you were to stream it, to have a content creator mode in it that will suppress the copyrighted music.
6011740	6016740	I checked out some video of it, it looks absolutely amazing.
6016740	6024740	It's just really realistic, like someone was playing the Buzz Lightyear ride, and you can actually shoot the targets and everything like that.
6024740	6026740	Which is pretty awesome.
6027340	6029340	Do you have a reason to play Minecraft again?
6029340	6031340	I think so, I want to check this out.
6031340	6033340	Autotopia.
6033340	6035340	Yeah, all the rides are in there.
6035340	6041340	I actually was going to get this for my kid, but I probably will have to try it out myself too.
6041340	6043340	It looks pretty cool.
6043340	6045340	Oh my gosh, Space Mountain.
6045340	6047340	Yeah, Space Mountain is in it.
6047340	6049340	This is definitely the Disney World stuff.
6049340	6051340	Wow, I want to check it out.
6051340	6053340	Can I get it on Xbox with that version?
6053340	6055340	Yes, that version is the one.
6055940	6057940	The DLC.
6057940	6059940	That's pretty neat, I might have to check that out.
6059940	6061940	That's really clever and cool.
6061940	6063940	This looks pretty neat.
6063940	6065940	The detail in it is amazing.
6065940	6074940	It's still Minecraft blocks, but they have an insane amount of custom items and obviously some customized stuff that they've coded into it.
6074940	6076940	They have the fireworks show that you can do as well.
6076940	6078940	Lots of cool stuff.
6078940	6081940	I saw some Grim Grinning Ghosts.
6081940	6083940	Yes, yes.
6084540	6088540	And they even have the barbershop quartet.
6088540	6090540	The Dapper Dans.
6090540	6092540	The Dapper Dans, they're in there.
6092540	6094540	That's fun.
6094540	6096540	Damn it, Disney.
6096540	6098540	Alright.
6098540	6103540	Dar Sakra, sorry to pull you away from that YouTube, but I know you have some headlines for us too.
6103540	6105540	Yes.
6106140	6113140	So, there is an update for Mario Kart Live, even though not everyone has been super into it.
6113140	6115140	Alright, great.
6115140	6119140	Mario Kart live in a box, because that's where my Mario Kart Live is.
6119140	6122140	Well, it's being referred to as version 2.0.
6122140	6135140	It has a split screen mode, so you can have two karts on one switch, a relay race, you have the Luigi Cup, three new courses, which is King Boo's Courtyard, Music Broadway, and Windmill Meadows.
6135740	6141740	And an unlockable cart that you get if you place in all of the new courses.
6141740	6144740	It's called Luigi's Poltergust.
6144740	6147740	And there you go.
6147740	6150740	If you're into it, maybe it's a reason to play again.
6150740	6152740	There you go.
6152740	6156740	And then I have to tell this site that I don't want cookies.
6156740	6158740	I mean, I want real cookies, but whatever.
6159340	6166340	So Sega has clarified their stance on the Microsoft thing.
6166340	6172340	Basically, the details are, I'm just going to go ahead and read this verbatim.
6172340	6175340	We already have a close business relationship with Microsoft.
6175340	6186340	We outsource the development of their large-scale titles, and as a third party, we are supplying a variety of titles, referring to their work on Halo Wars 2 and Age of Empires 4.
6186940	6197940	So they're not talking about exclusivity, but to do a super game initiative, something that they're going to be working on together.
6199940	6201940	Very curious to see what comes of that, that's for sure.
6203940	6204940	All right.
6204940	6207940	Let's travel around the world and check out releases for this week.
6207940	6214940	I'm not sure we have a lot, a lot, because the games that want to be sold on Black Friday should be out by now.
6215540	6220540	I guess we did have a couple of games that released last year on Black Friday, but let's check in with...
6220540	6222540	Does it exist in Japan?
6222540	6223540	Yeah, that's true.
6223540	6224540	We got the rest of the world too.
6224540	6226540	So, Loki, what's coming out this week?
6226540	6230540	So, this week we've got not a whole ton.
6230540	6241540	We have RE Legend, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One.
6242140	6247140	Death's Door, which is on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6247140	6248140	That's it.
6248140	6249140	All right.
6249140	6251140	As DarkSakura alluded to, much different story in Japan.
6251140	6254140	We have a lot of releases actually this week on the Switch.
6254140	6259140	Ironically, Dead by Daylight, getting a fifth anniversary edition on the Nintendo Switch.
6259140	6264140	And that is, they labeled it as in English, but it is a Japanese localized release.
6264140	6268140	Kukiomi 123, also out in Japan this week on the Switch.
6268740	6272740	We have Deer Simulator, your average everyday deer game.
6272740	6274740	I like that it's got an honest title.
6274740	6275740	I kind of want to play that.
6275740	6276740	It's a goat stimulator.
6276740	6278740	It's really stupid.
6278740	6280740	I like stupid.
6280740	6281740	It's pretty stupid.
6281740	6283740	Well, that's out in Japan this week.
6283740	6287740	We have Eastward, also coming out in Japan this week, all on the 25th.
6287740	6290740	Asatsugatori is also out this week.
6290740	6293740	And we have some other games in regular and limited edition.
6293740	6297740	One releases Parfait Remake, and the other releases Fuyukiss.
6298340	6301340	Those are just the Nintendo Switch titles for this week.
6301340	6303340	Taking a look at PlayStation 5.
6303340	6308340	Farming Simulator 22 gets its Japanese release this week, as well as Disciples Liberation.
6308340	6312340	Treasures of the Agian, again, Dead by Daylight.
6312340	6313340	Aegean?
6313340	6314340	Yes, that's it.
6314340	6315340	Like the Aegean Sea?
6315340	6320340	Dead by Daylight also getting its Japanese release, or I think it's like a different bundle basically.
6320340	6324340	I think it's been out in Japan, but the fifth anniversary edition is out this week.
6324940	6330940	And then Cricket 22, the official game of the Ashes, also out in Japan this week.
6330940	6336940	And quickly glancing at the PlayStation 4 to see if there's anything that wasn't already covered on the Switch.
6336940	6343940	I think mostly it's the same stuff, but you do have, oh okay, you get a price reduction on Need for Speed Heat.
6343940	6350940	And then the whole, looks like Biohazard 25th, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, those different episodes.
6351540	6357540	Those are, I think they're a price reduction as well, happening on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6357540	6360540	Dead by Daylight also on PS4 if you care.
6360540	6366540	Well, sometimes Jamie gets really bored early in the morning and watches Japanese streamers playing Dead by Daylight.
6366540	6368540	Oh, fun!
6368540	6378540	And sometimes they'll say, oh, you know, they'll actually talk to English viewers, so I think it's pretty fun.
6379140	6383140	Oh, that's neat. Well, they have a new retail release for whatever reason.
6383140	6389140	I imagine it probably just bundles in some of the DLC and, you know, trying to draw new people into the game, so that is available.
6389140	6394140	Yep. All right, so for Europe then, right?
6394140	6395140	Yep.
6395140	6398140	Okay, just making sure you got everything because they're pretty big.
6398140	6404140	Well, it's already out now, but Farming Simulator 22 came out today.
6404740	6409740	And then for the 23rd, we have Let's Sing 2022 on Switch.
6409740	6418740	On the 25th, we have Cricket 22, the official games of the Ashes for PlayStation and Xbox.
6418740	6421740	We have Asterix and Obelix, slap them all.
6421740	6422740	Funny comics.
6422740	6427740	So we have that on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.
6428340	6433340	And then on the 26th, we have Windlands 2 for PlayStation.
6436340	6437340	That's it.
6437340	6439340	All right, that's it.
6439340	6446340	We still have some more headlines for you guys and then, of course, we'll get to that part of the show where you can call in or email or any of that stuff.
6446340	6450340	We'll get to that in just a little bit, but first, Loki with another headline.
6450340	6452340	Yeah, so this is kind of cool.
6452940	6455940	This is something that was more of a rumor in leaks.
6455940	6461940	We talked about like the fighting game that had like Shaggy and Superman and whatnot, but apparently it's actually a real thing.
6461940	6464940	So it's going to be a free to play game that Warner games is putting out.
6464940	6472940	And it's basically like a Smash Brothers game, but it has all sorts of different characters in it from different Warner Brothers properties.
6472940	6478940	So right now, the roster that they showed off, they've got Aria Stark from Game of Thrones.
6479540	6490540	We have Batman, Superman, Bugs Bunny, Finn the Human, Jake Dogg, Harley Quinn, Shaggy, Tom and Jerry, Wonder Woman.
6490540	6497540	And then they've got a new character that they created called Rain Dog and Garnet, who I have no idea what show she is from.
6497540	6500540	That would probably be Steven Universe, right?
6500540	6502540	It may be Steven Universe.
6502540	6504540	Yeah, I'm not familiar with Steven Universe.
6505140	6515140	This actually seems to be a little bit better than, say, the Nintendo one that just came out recently was you may remember that none of their characters were voice acted.
6515140	6520140	Whereas in this one, all of the characters are voice acted and by the people that actually...
6520140	6522140	Did you mean Nickelodeon, not Nintendo?
6522140	6523140	Yeah, the Nickelodeon one.
6523140	6524140	Yeah, sorry.
6524140	6525140	Not Nintendo.
6525140	6527140	The Nickelodeon one is what I was talking about.
6527140	6533140	So they have like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.
6533740	6539740	And of course, Maisie Williams reprising Aria and John DiMaggio as Jake the Dogg and stuff.
6539740	6544740	So very huge cast of voice actors in that.
6544740	6551740	It's supposed to be coming out later, I guess, next year and on all the consoles and PC and stuff.
6551740	6556740	Many folks in chat referencing how this game appears to be very meme-ified.
6556740	6559740	It kind of seems to exist for the memes.
6560340	6563340	Not only do you have Matthew Lillard doing Shaggy, which is something the internet is,
6563340	6567340	you know, memed all over the place, Pod Culture points out...
6567340	6569340	Casey Kasem is clearly dead.
6569340	6573840	Pod Culture points out Shaggy has a Smoke Em Out move, which is obviously a wink and
6573840	6576340	a nod to what we all know Shaggy is doing.
6576340	6578340	And he can also Super Saiyan or whatever.
6578340	6580340	So it's like the Super Shaggy thing.
6580340	6581340	Yeah.
6581340	6583340	Does he have to eat a Scooby snack for it?
6583340	6584340	Yeah.
6584340	6588740	Bonds 006 in chat says, to think, someone at WB actually went to their boss with this
6588740	6590740	idea and he approved it.
6590740	6595740	Well, you know what, we've had enough stories about idiot executives tonight.
6595740	6597740	It's time to recognize a good one.
6597740	6600740	So congrats that guy at WB who gave us the green light.
6600740	6602740	It could be a lady, Rob.
6602740	6603740	You're right.
6603740	6606740	Let's not give them credit for coming up with this idea.
6606740	6608740	It's not a unique idea.
6608740	6611740	Let's look at the history here.
6611740	6617740	So we have Ready Player One that they tried this with already with shoehorning as many
6617740	6619740	things as possible in there.
6619740	6625740	Then Space Jam 2 or Ready Player One Part Two, where they tried shoehorning as many
6625740	6627740	Warner Brothers properties as possible.
6627740	6631740	Thankfully though, on the game side, it seemed to work out a little bit better because, you
6631740	6634740	know, we've got Lego Dimensions, which is fantastic.
6634740	6639740	So I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
6639740	6643740	Maybe can we get some like other properties like, you know, Lego Dimensions in this as
6643740	6644740	well?
6644740	6645740	I mean,
6646740	6651740	Because maybe we get Chell from, you know, portal fighting in here as well.
6651740	6652740	No, no, no.
6652740	6655740	We need Space Ghost.
6655740	6657740	Space Ghost needs to be in it.
6657740	6659740	Space Ghost is a superhero.
6659740	6661740	I'm sure there's plenty more lists to come.
6661740	6662740	This is not going to be the end of it.
6662740	6663740	I'm yes.
6663740	6664740	It's a small roster.
6664740	6668740	And they've already said that they're planning on adding more characters as they go along.
6668740	6670740	And they have also different like skins and whatnot.
6670740	6671740	Obviously, free to play game.
6672740	6674740	So you're going to, you know, buy stuff.
6674740	6677740	What if they added in like Grape Ape?
6677740	6679740	There's a lot of things they could add in this.
6679740	6681740	That would be though hilarious.
6681740	6683740	Like this big giant character.
6683740	6685740	That would be awesome.
6685740	6686740	All right.
6686740	6687740	Moving on.
6687740	6688740	Let's talk about.
6688740	6690740	I'm a fan of the obscure.
6690740	6691740	Moving on.
6691740	6694740	Let's talk about maybe this game will get nominated at next year's The Game Awards.
6694740	6696740	I doubt it, but it might.
6696740	6699740	But we know the nominees for this year's The Game Awards.
6699740	6702740	This kind of snuck up on us, but it is around that time of year.
6702740	6704740	Usually Thanksgiving weeks away.
6704740	6705740	Yeah.
6705740	6706740	It all moves so fast.
6706740	6715740	Like we find out the nominees this week and then the ceremony is just in a couple of weeks, which it sounds like, by the way, I can't go because they didn't open the tickets to the public this year.
6715740	6716740	So that's kind of a bummer.
6716740	6720740	But honestly, after reading the games that got nominated.
6720740	6724740	There's a very obvious oversight in here, in my humble opinion.
6724740	6729740	However, the nominees for Game of the Year are Deathloop.
6729740	6730740	Doesn't surprise me.
6730740	6740740	A lot of people talking about kind of the story I haven't played yet, but a lot of people talking about the story of that game and how it's kind of pretty innovative, what it does with some of the time stuff and making that a mechanic.
6740740	6743740	It Takes Two was nominated.
6743740	6745740	Metroid Dread is nominated.
6745740	6747740	So there's your Nintendo pick in the back.
6747740	6749740	There's always a Nintendo one in the back.
6749740	6752740	Psychonauts 2 got a nomination as well.
6752740	6755740	So that is the representative from the Xbox area.
6755740	6759740	Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart, also nominated for Game of the Year.
6759740	6763740	And Resident Evil Village, nominated for Game of the Year as well.
6763740	6766740	So those are your nominees for Game of the Year.
6766740	6768740	Nowhere to be seen.
6768740	6772740	The game that has been getting tens, tens, tens across the board from all the critics.
6772740	6774740	Forza Horizon 5.
6774740	6776740	Um, all right.
6776740	6778740	I guess somebody thought...
6778740	6781740	The Game of War is more like fiscal year?
6781740	6784740	No, no, it is, it is, uh, it is calendar year.
6784740	6788740	It is allowed to be included if it was released before like November.
6788740	6792740	Basically all the games released before Black Friday are eligible in a nutshell.
6792740	6795740	So yes, even though it was just a moment ago, it's kind of like the Oscar movies.
6795740	6799740	As long as it plays in a theater in LA, in a theater in New York before the end of the year, it's eligible.
6799740	6802740	So, um, Forza should have been eligible.
6802740	6808740	Um, but I understand that some folks might find it a little bit reductive from part four
6808740	6813740	because, you know, it's more of the same even if it is really, really good what it is doing.
6813740	6818740	Um, I still think at some point you have to acknowledge what the series is doing.
6818740	6822740	I'm sort of reminded of the Oscars when they finally recognized Return of the King
6822740	6825740	as best picture of the year because the trilogy was over at that point.
6825740	6831740	So I worry the Horizon series is not going to get its due until Playground Games comes out and says,
6831740	6834740	this is the last one, which I don't want to ever see that happen to be quite honest.
6834740	6839740	So, um, anyway, that's my piece on that. I said what I said.
6839740	6842740	Uh, this is an interesting layout of games.
6842740	6847740	And what's interesting about it, it's kind of hard for me to say X is the front runner.
6847740	6852740	I've heard a lot of buzz about all of these games in one way or another.
6852740	6854740	I'm not sure there is a front runner.
6854740	6861740	I would guess Metroid Dread, but that might be a little bit of personal kind of coming into it.
6861740	6865740	Um, Deathloop, I've also heard a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff about.
6865740	6869740	Um, so, yeah, let's see.
6869740	6875740	Now, some folks in chat mentioning Mike Deft says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated for other awards.
6875740	6878740	And Bobby Lockl says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated in three other categories.
6878740	6883740	Yes, yes, we love nominations in the technical categories for a pity award.
6883740	6886740	Same thing happens with the movie awards, right?
6886740	6890740	You get this great movie and then it's like, oh, it got nominated for costume design.
6890740	6891740	How cute.
6891740	6894740	Um, not that costume design is important.
6894740	6895740	I'm just saying.
6895740	6897740	Uh, let's see.
6897740	6901740	Mike Deft says I think Returnal is missing from that game of the year list.
6901740	6904740	Not the first person I've heard say that.
6904740	6905740	That's for sure.
6905740	6912740	I've seen a lot of that on social media is that people think because of the bugs that existed in Returnal at the very beginning,
6912740	6917740	it's kind of getting the shaft here, um, which, you know, is a problem all in itself.
6917740	6919740	So that's somewhat interesting.
6919740	6920740	Let me see.
6920740	6921740	There's a lot of categories, you guys.
6921740	6927740	I don't want to read them all, but let me see if there's another category I want to do here.
6927740	6932740	I want to talk about performance.
6932740	6933740	Where is it?
6933740	6938740	There's like voice performance.
6938740	6939740	Hold on, I'm looking for a guy.
6939740	6941740	Sorry, I know this is terrible radio.
6941740	6942740	There it is.
6942740	6943740	Interesting.
6944740	6950740	I don't know if it ever was split into actor and actress type of thing, but just a note.
6950740	6952740	Now it is just best performance.
6952740	6957740	I know I've seen another award show in gaming that was split, so I just think that's interesting.
6957740	6960740	The nominees in that category.
6960740	6965740	Erica Mori, nominated as Alex in Life is Strange True Colors.
6965740	6970740	Giancarlo Esposito, nominated for Anton Castillo in Far Cry 6.
6970740	6974740	Jason Kelly, nominated as Colt Vaughn in Deathloop.
6974740	6979740	Maggie Robertson, nominated as Lady Dimitrescu for Resident Evil Village.
6979740	6985740	And Ozioma, I hope I said that right, Akaga as Juliana Blake in Deathloop as well.
6985740	6989740	There is a very clear front runner there in my opinion, but then again, I haven't played Deathloop.
6989740	6997740	So maybe, but in my opinion, that Lady Dimitrescu kind of like own that game, but she wasn't in it very long.
6997740	6998740	Spoiler alert.
6998740	7000740	So I don't know.
7000740	7002740	So I don't know.
7002740	7004740	Wasn't that Resident Evil and not Deathloop?
7004740	7005740	No, no. Yes.
7005740	7008740	Yes. Lady Dimitrescu was in Resident Evil, but not for very long.
7008740	7014740	Still, because I thought you were saying it in the context of Deathloop and I'm like, what?
7014740	7015740	Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.
7015740	7016740	Sorry.
7016740	7017740	So, yeah, hold on.
7017740	7019740	I'm looking to see if there's any comments there.
7019740	7023740	Mike Deaf does say Deathloop has really good voice acting.
7023740	7025740	Yeah, there you go.
7026740	7031740	Garth the Wolf in Chat says doing Hades Extreme while listening to the show LMAO Loot Dragon Time.
7031740	7033740	Hey, that's last year's Game of the Year right there.
7033740	7034740	Or at least it was nominated.
7034740	7038740	It didn't actually win, but I know it got nominated.
7038740	7041740	Yeah, Mike Deaf says Lady Dimitrescu is the people's vote.
7041740	7044740	Yeah, Tigerclaw says Giancarlo Esposito is a good actor.
7044740	7045740	He could win it.
7045740	7047740	It's a good group, if nothing else.
7047740	7049740	So there is that.
7049740	7052740	So, yeah, I think that's all I'll read.
7052740	7055740	If you want to see more of the nominees, you can head on over to the Game Award websites.
7055740	7062740	Of course, you can vote, but if you read the fine print, audience voting is only 10% of the vote.
7062740	7065740	That way you guys can't fuck it up.
7065740	7069740	The critics and the board still have 90% of the say.
7069740	7074740	I haven't checked the fine print this year to see if maybe those numbers shifted, so disclaimer,
7074740	7077740	but I know in previous years the people's vote is only 10% of the vote.
7077740	7081740	So just an interesting little footnote you may have missed.
7081740	7083740	All right, we have a few more stories for you guys.
7083740	7086740	Let's go to Dark Sakura with our next story.
7086740	7097740	So, well, people like BTS, and BTS has been doing several collaborations across the board with other things.
7097740	7106740	So they're actually going to be working with doing a collaboration with Among Us.
7106740	7113740	They're going to have the BT21 characters that were created by line friends
7113740	7120740	to do all animated versions of the members of BTS for Among Us.
7120740	7122740	So there you go.
7122740	7127740	I don't listen to BTS. A lot of people do.
7127740	7136740	I've listened to a few things, but I mean, I think it's kind of cool that there's this big international thing going on,
7136740	7138740	that they've hit it so big.
7138740	7141740	They're involved in games that a lot of people around the world are going to be playing.
7141740	7144740	So there you go.
7144740	7146740	I'll be interested to see.
7146740	7149740	It would be a nice kick in the pants for Among Us, too.
7149740	7152740	I know there's still people playing it, but I do kind of feel like that game sort of peaked,
7152740	7155740	at least as far as like the Twitch interactivity and stuff, a while ago.
7155740	7159740	Yes, I know people are still playing it, but not as many as were.
7159740	7165740	But this could be the nice little like kick in the pants that that game could kind of use to get people to play it again.
7165740	7166740	So we'll see.
7166740	7170740	I think it's more that people outside of the US are playing it more.
7170740	7172740	Oh, good point. Fair point.
7172740	7174740	You're not the only country in the world.
7174740	7175740	That's true.
7175740	7179740	Jason and chat are voiceover dudes saying Among Us collab, not Fortnite.
7179740	7180740	Bless.
7180740	7181740	Hey, you know what, though?
7181740	7185740	I have to say, remember the Ariana Grande Fortnite collab was actually pretty cool.
7185740	7190740	Like in that day, take that for somebody who does not play Fortnite, but kind of wanted to for that.
7190740	7196740	Garth, the wolf in chat says BTS came out with the best sauces McDonald's has had for their nuggies in years.
7196740	7197740	Honestly, truth.
7197740	7202740	Like I know BTS from the McDonald's meal and those sauces were really good.
7202740	7206740	So there is they have I'm unfamiliar with.
7206740	7211740	I think they exist in other again, like dark soccer kind of pointed out other other parts of the world.
7211740	7214740	And I think they just made them for the US for a short time.
7214740	7219740	I want to say there was a spicy chili sauce and some type of mustard sauce.
7219740	7223740	Garth, the wolf. Correct me if I'm wrong. It was it was as like a spicy mustard as well.
7223740	7226740	Maybe it was a chili sauce and spicy mustard, but they were really good.
7226740	7231740	Oh, thank you. Garth, the wolf says Cajun and sweet chili were the two sauces.
7231740	7237740	OK, they were good. Who had the mustard? Somebody, another artist had the mustard then.
7237740	7242740	Was that Saweetie? I don't know. All right. Anyway, moving on.
7242740	7246740	Let's get to Loki's story.
7246740	7254740	So this is out of like left field here, but apparently there was a video put up or a brand new site, I should say,
7254740	7259740	called Beyond the Groovy that's been put up by Interplay Entertainment.
7260740	7265740	And it is kind of showing off Earthworm Jim as an animated series.
7265740	7268740	I don't know if these are like animation tests or what,
7268740	7275740	but apparently there's an animated series for Earthworm Jim coming out. Wasn't there already?
7275740	7281740	Yeah, there was a cartoon in the past. This is going to be like a computer animated thing.
7281740	7286740	It looks all right. I mean, I like I like the old cartoon,
7286740	7292740	so sure. Why not? Beats what Earthworm Jim 4 looks like.
7292740	7298740	It's an interesting development as far as Intellivision having that property right now.
7298740	7302740	I don't put too much stock in that, but it's interesting.
7302740	7307740	That's it. Like interesting can go a lot of ways. I just think it's interesting.
7307740	7314740	Yeah. So. All right. Last. No one asked for this, but sure.
7314740	7322740	Last but not least, I thought this was a very interesting story with the former VP of marketing for Nintendo of America.
7322740	7327740	You know, the GameCube is 20 years old now. It originally came out in 2001 for the holidays.
7327740	7334740	And here we are. Holidays 2021. VGC had an interview with Perrin Kaplan,
7334740	7340740	who you might remember from some of the older E3s who at the time was VP of marketing at Nintendo America.
7340740	7351740	And in the interview, Perrin Kaplan mentioned that the PR marketing teams at Nintendo of America were not happy with the purple color choice for the GameCube.
7351740	7357740	And that these teams informed Nintendo Japan of this. But Nintendo Japan has the final say.
7357740	7362740	And so that was it. Nintendo America was told, nope, this is the direction we're going in.
7362740	7365740	Nintendo of America wanted to do black and silver at launch,
7365740	7369740	which is funny because those colors came later, if I'm not mistaken, because I had a silver one.
7369740	7373740	Thanks to Loki. Loki bought me a GameCube. Wasn't it a silver one? I think it was.
7373740	7379740	So I liked purple. Yeah, I like the color. We never got over here with spice.
7379740	7385740	Yeah. Yeah. But what's interesting now, here's the.
7385740	7394740	Nintendo of America thought the purple GameCube looked too feminine and they were nervous that it would be slated at E3 based on the color.
7394740	7402740	And here's the quote from Perrin Kaplan, who, if I'm not mistaken, is it wasn't Perrin Kaplan a one or is a woman?
7402740	7408740	I think so. What I remember. We actually suggested that the purple was not the best to start with.
7408740	7415740	And Japan said, no, we're going to use that. Then we pushed for black and silver because I think in the US, nobody had ever really done the purple color before.
7415740	7420740	It wasn't that you couldn't bring out hardware that was a different color. It was just a very female looking color.
7420740	7430740	It just didn't feel masculine, I think. I remember us being very nervous at E3 that we were going to get bad press of purple based on the color.
7430740	7439740	Beth Lujan, who is the former director of corporate communications, says this predates Apple picking your color these days is like making a statement.
7439740	7443740	But back then, all the game systems were black. Even white hadn't really been done widely.
7443740	7450740	Nintendo was never a technology story, but we were always combating what our competitors at Sony and Microsoft were doing from a PR perspective.
7450740	7460740	And having this purple box didn't quite help there. Beth, wasn't the Super Nintendo a white and purple console?
7460740	7468740	Am I am I recalling that incorrectly? Wasn't the Nintendo Entertainment System agree?
7468740	7475740	All right. It was it was just two different shades of gray overseas.
7476740	7483740	And I think that this might be, I hate to say it, but a coded phrase.
7483740	7495740	And I'm going to just call it out there. I mean, I kind of think that there is a big stink of maybe some homophobia behind behind this comment.
7495740	7497740	Interesting.
7497740	7501740	Because I mean.
7501740	7511740	There was like, well, what was it that I was reading that that things that are purple are coded to be more toward the LGBT community in marketing?
7511740	7514740	I've heard that, too. Yeah.
7514740	7519740	And so I mean, so basically, like, does this make our system look gay?
7519740	7529740	You know, that's how I'm I'm not going to fault Perrin for the compliment or for the comment, because she's speaking of an industry 20 years ago and that whole thing.
7529740	7536740	So I'm not I'm like, I'm not my target isn't on her for that comment, but it is just fascinating.
7536740	7540740	And to look in retrospect, did anyone fucking care that it was purple?
7540740	7544740	Actually, I kind of liked that original car. I love my silver game.
7545740	7547740	The purple was fine.
7547740	7548740	My purple.
7548740	7550740	It's it's a weird comment.
7550740	7558740	That second comment that talks about all the other game consoles being black and white, that Atari had a very definitive kind of wood color to it.
7558740	7559740	It wasn't really totally.
7559740	7561740	That was also the 70s, Rob.
7561740	7564740	I know, but everything was wood paneled in the 70s.
7564740	7567740	Game systems are all sorts of colors.
7567740	7569740	It's weird.
7569740	7572740	Channel F was what? Orange and yellow.
7572740	7574740	That was also the 70s, though.
7574740	7576740	TigerCon chat says, what's wrong with purple?
7576740	7577740	Vogue network is purple.
7577740	7578740	Nothing.
7578740	7579740	Nothing's wrong with purple.
7579740	7580740	I love purple.
7580740	7582740	Twitch is purple everywhere.
7582740	7586740	Like, but again, also talking about a different market.
7586740	7590740	Yes. And Perrin is talking about an industry 20 years ago.
7590740	7596740	And speech is very coded for meaning one thing and saying it a different way as so not to cause offense.
7596740	7597740	Yeah, I get it.
7597740	7603740	But it's not the first time I've I've heard that terminology used in a homophobic light.
7603740	7608740	You're right. She might be covering up for something way worse.
7608740	7618740	And I understand that she got to choose her words carefully there, because, you know, if she potentially allegedly said what we are drawing conclusions to, admittedly, we don't know.
7618740	7619740	We weren't in the room.
7619740	7620740	We don't know.
7620740	7627740	But, you know, that obviously, if she'd said that very frankly, that would have caused a much bigger stink and she probably wouldn't be giving any more interviews.
7627740	7634740	So which and probably, though, in the day, it would be said that way because.
7634740	7636740	Yeah, I get it.
7636740	7638740	People today are a lot more conscious of it.
7638740	7641740	I get it. TigerClaw again with an excellent point.
7641740	7643740	This is the last purple thing I'm going to read, guys.
7643740	7648740	TigerClaw in chat says Mace Windu's lightsaber was purple from the Star Wars prequels.
7648740	7650740	That if I remember my.
7650740	7651740	That was Samuel's pick.
7651740	7653740	Yeah, it was Samuel L. Jackson's pick.
7653740	7658740	He said he would only play the part if he could have a purple lightsaber and they gave it to him.
7658740	7660740	So because he's Sammy fucking L.
7660740	7662740	Because Samuel L. Jackson's a fucking badass.
7662740	7665740	We all know that. So he tells you to do something.
7665740	7666740	You better listen.
7666740	7671740	He needed to be in the room when they were choosing the color purple for the GameCube.
7671740	7675740	He would have shut that down.
7675740	7677740	Bitch.
7677740	7679740	Exactly. All right.
7679740	7684740	Do you recall me giving you a choice of what color you could pick?
7684740	7687740	I don't think so.
7687740	7689740	All right.
7689740	7690740	It's motherfucking purple.
7690740	7692740	Let's go to the listener roundtable.
7692740	7694740	We invite your emails every week.
7694740	7697740	Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
7697740	7700740	I think I only saw a spam email in there, but I'll check with Dark Soccer.
7700740	7701740	See if we got anything.
7701740	7703740	There were nothing but several spam emails.
7703740	7705740	Only one that cleans out spam emails.
7705740	7706740	Apparently they found us.
7706740	7709740	No, I get everything forwards to my personal email.
7709740	7710740	So I know there.
7710740	7711740	So, yeah.
7711740	7712740	All right.
7712740	7714740	It wasn't nothing was deleted, but it's fine.
7714740	7718740	So I will invite calls if anyone wants to call in.
7718740	7720740	Head on over to our discord.
7720740	7722740	I'm watching Drag Race.
7722740	7725740	Vogue network dot com slash discord.
7725740	7726740	Oh, yeah.
7726740	7728740	We we usually do drag race talk when there's no emails.
7729740	7731740	But I can't watch any drag race now.
7731740	7732740	So whatever.
7732740	7733740	And none of it's on.
7733740	7734740	Right.
7734740	7737740	I mean, there's international versions, but that's what I'm saying.
7737740	7738740	I can't watch.
7738740	7742740	I don't have any of the paramount shit.
7742740	7747740	OK, let's go to questions in chat, which we invite those as well.
7747740	7748740	No one special.
7748740	7751740	Seventy seven has a good food related question to start us off.
7751740	7753740	I guess a little mini Orange Lounge foodie.
7753740	7757740	Oh, do you associate eating a specific food with gaming?
7757740	7759740	If so, what food for me?
7759740	7763740	I associate pizza and cola with gaming on account that I went to show
7763740	7765740	this pizza place in the early 80s.
7765740	7768740	And that was an early experience with gaming for me.
7768740	7771740	Does anyone associate food with gaming?
7771740	7772740	Yes.
7772740	7777740	Is there a cheese sticks and DDR?
7777740	7778740	That's true.
7778740	7779740	Where this show was born.
7779740	7780740	Right.
7780740	7784740	Those good ass mozzarella cheese sticks that the cafe in front of
7784740	7785740	Golf Land sold.
7785740	7786740	Yeah.
7786740	7787740	All right.
7787740	7788740	I'm with you there.
7788740	7793740	This question is a little weird for me now after everything I talked
7793740	7799740	about last week, but I'm not sure I have.
7799740	7804740	I'm not sure I have, like, a Pavlov response to some sort of food
7804740	7805740	and gaming like that.
7805740	7808740	I mean, I do remember, like, like, you know, in special,
7808740	7811740	I do remember that my like an early,
7811740	7812740	early gaming experience,
7812740	7817740	like my first arcade memory I very clearly remember was playing Crystal
7817740	7820740	Castles standing on a booster because kids had to use the boosters
7820740	7823740	because we were short and it was at a Chuck E.
7823740	7825740	Cheese pizza.
7825740	7828740	So I associate like Crystal Castles with Chuck E.
7828740	7829740	Cheese.
7829740	7832740	But like, why would I ever in my life crave Chuck E.
7832740	7833740	Cheese pizza?
7833740	7834740	Because the Chuck E.
7834740	7837740	Cheese pizza back in the 80s was really good.
7837740	7838740	Okay.
7839740	7841740	Now, not so much.
7841740	7845740	And also, like, I remember then, like, they kept arcades,
7845740	7848740	like pretty dark because it's arcade games.
7848740	7850740	You don't want the glare on the screen.
7850740	7851740	So good pizza, dark arcades.
7851740	7853740	Yes, that's the way it is.
7853740	7857740	Now it's just like ticket spitters and bad pizza.
7857740	7858740	I have one.
7858740	7859740	Okay. Yes.
7859740	7861740	And then I have one that I know dark soccer will agree with.
7861740	7862740	But you first.
7862740	7863740	Pop Rocks.
7863740	7865740	Oh, how's that associate with games for you?
7866740	7868740	Because when I worked in an arcade,
7868740	7870740	remember I worked at one for a while,
7870740	7872740	I would save up all the little single tickets
7872740	7874740	that people would leave in the machines.
7874740	7878740	And I would redeem them for Pop Rocks during my shift.
7878740	7882740	And then I would bounce around like a maniac my entire shift
7882740	7886740	and then go home and crash hardcore.
7886740	7890740	Like, I mean, the machines actually gave me migraines,
7890740	7893740	which was pretty unfortunate given that I, you know,
7893740	7895740	like being saying that I could work at an arcade,
7895740	7899740	but it was Pop Rocks.
7899740	7900740	And I mean,
7900740	7903740	and Pop Rocks and Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks
7903740	7906740	also got me through my first exam week of college.
7906740	7910740	The week I didn't sleep for a week.
7910740	7914740	Going to chat, we have a few other comments on this.
7914740	7915740	Garth the Wolf says,
7915740	7917740	I associate Halo 3 with Cheez-Its
7917740	7920740	because me and a friend ate them while playing together, LOL.
7921740	7925740	And E3VL says, yeah, pizza back in the day was good,
7925740	7927740	especially Pizza Hut before they changed the recipe.
7927740	7929740	Okay, I have one more.
7929740	7931740	Pizza Hut is so much better now.
7931740	7933740	I have a food association, Dark Soccer.
7933740	7934740	I know you're going to.
7934740	7941740	It's the drink propel and the DDR days.
7941740	7946740	And that is like if you listen to the early episodes of OLR,
7946740	7947740	not that I would encourage people to do that,
7947740	7949740	but I know some of you do it anyway.
7949740	7952740	Like there were seriously like propel worship episodes
7952740	7953740	of that show.
7953740	7954740	We would drink it while doing the show.
7954740	7956740	Now I can't stand that shit.
7956740	7959740	I don't mind it, but I have the texture of it.
7959740	7961740	I haven't checked to see if it jives
7961740	7963740	with what I currently am facing,
7963740	7966740	so probably not to be honest.
7966740	7968740	Well, actually propel is sugar free.
7968740	7969740	Oh, that's good.
7969740	7971740	Okay, then I probably can have it.
7971740	7972740	But I don't hate it.
7972740	7976740	The other thing for me is Brookfield's Mini Loaves.
7976740	7978740	Yeah, yeah.
7978740	7982740	And I actually blame Jessica for that.
7982740	7983740	It's good stuff.
7983740	7986740	And now I cannot go to Brookfield's
7986740	7990740	without being pissed off that not all of them
7990740	7991740	will have Mini Loaves available.
7991740	7992740	Oh, they don't?
7992740	7993740	That's unfortunate.
7993740	7997740	To go with my Avgo Lemono that I've become addicted to.
7997740	7998740	Yes.
7998740	8000740	They had great chicken tortilla soup, too.
8000740	8002740	Rob, let's go to Brookfield's.
8002740	8004740	I'm challenged to eat some of the things
8004740	8005740	I used to enjoy there.
8005740	8007740	I guess I could always have a salad.
8007740	8008740	There's other stuff.
8008740	8010740	You can have me.
8010740	8012740	Also, in a couple months,
8012740	8014740	we can reevaluate some things
8014740	8016740	and hopefully get to bring some things back.
8016740	8017740	We'll see.
8017740	8018740	We'll see.
8018740	8021740	Okay, I did see a call sneak into the green room,
8021740	8024740	so I want to take it because this is, of course,
8024740	8027740	an old OLR favorite to invite back on the show here.
8027740	8030740	So let's bring him into the room and say,
8030740	8032740	hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
8032740	8034740	Who's this?
8034740	8036740	This is YYR.
8036740	8038740	Hey, YYR.
8038740	8042740	Yes, I caught the tail end of your stream.
8042740	8044740	I did.
8044740	8046740	Yeah, I was on mobile, so I wasn't really chatting,
8046740	8049740	but your friend that you were playing with
8049740	8051740	was playing Max 300 on standard
8051740	8053740	and used some type of modifier
8053740	8057740	that added extra notes in the middle of runs.
8057740	8060740	I was like, why on earth did you do that to yourself?
8060740	8065740	Well, we were using all kinds of crazy mods
8065740	8066740	the entire time.
8066740	8069740	I would definitely encourage folks to check out the VOD.
8069740	8071740	I'll link to it in the Discord.
8071740	8076740	But some of the things we did included, you know,
8076740	8078740	hidden plus sudden at the same time,
8078740	8081740	which StepMania does.
8081740	8083740	DDR doesn't.
8083740	8085740	Basically, you get to see the arrows
8085740	8087740	for just like a very short time in the middle.
8087740	8090740	And what else?
8090740	8092740	I did a low-scoring set
8092740	8094740	where I intentionally got the lowest possible passing score.
8094740	8097740	I think I got about a 32% on expert.
8097740	8100740	Congrats, I think.
8100740	8104740	I played completely silent one song.
8104740	8107740	I played the expert chart with no audio.
8107740	8110740	I played the expert chart with different audio.
8110740	8115740	And then just all kinds of other crazy, silly things
8115740	8118740	to try to break up the monotony a little bit.
8118740	8122740	And I saw you raised some good money for charity,
8122740	8123740	so congratulations.
8123740	8125740	I apologize for the terrible camera angle in Discord.
8125740	8127740	I'm doing my best here.
8127740	8129740	But now we actually brought,
8129740	8130740	I don't know if you were listening
8130740	8131740	at the beginning of the show,
8131740	8132740	but right at the beginning of the show,
8132740	8134740	I did talk about your little announcement
8134740	8135740	that you made at the end.
8135740	8138740	Oh, I appreciate that.
8138740	8144740	That you're adding the dance mode into super multitasking.
8144740	8146740	But I couldn't remember all of the details
8146740	8147740	about the other stuff too.
8147740	8150740	Can you elaborate on what else you're working with
8150740	8152740	with super multitasking?
8153740	8155740	Well, I mean, I have to admit,
8155740	8159740	I didn't do much apart from, you know,
8159740	8165740	I didn't announce much apart from the workout mode.
8165740	8166740	Okay.
8166740	8168740	I'm working on the expansion.
8168740	8170740	Oh, I see you allocated a spot for me.
8170740	8172740	I guess I might as well do this.
8175740	8176740	Sure.
8176740	8177740	Access camera.
8177740	8179740	Cool.
8179740	8180740	Sup?
8180740	8181740	Hi, good to see you.
8182740	8183740	Thanks.
8183740	8187740	So, yes, what I announced today,
8187740	8189740	basically I'm working on the new minigames
8189740	8192740	for the expansion that's still coming sometime next year.
8192740	8195740	I don't want to commit to a certain time of the year,
8195740	8199740	but several of them are done now.
8199740	8202740	But the only one I have announced to date
8202740	8204740	is this dance game.
8204740	8208740	It plays on one of the thumb sticks.
8208740	8210740	It's very simple.
8210740	8212740	It only lasts for about 12 seconds,
8212740	8213740	like all the others,
8213740	8215740	and you just, you know, push in the proper direction
8215740	8216740	when the arrow comes up.
8216740	8221740	But I really feel like I captured the feel of DDR pretty well.
8221740	8225740	And it plays nicely, and I'm really excited about it.
8225740	8229740	But I knew from the very beginning that I, you know,
8229740	8232740	from the moment I decided to put this minigame in there,
8232740	8235740	I knew from the very beginning that I wanted to actually put
8235740	8238740	a dance pad mode in the game.
8238740	8242740	Because, I mean, because I'm ridiculous, that's why.
8242740	8247740	And it, yeah, it actually plays really well,
8247740	8251740	except for the fact that I need to work on the jump processing,
8251740	8254740	because DDR and Step Mania, I don't know if you noticed this,
8254740	8260740	but if your feet don't go down at the exact same frame
8260740	8262740	or moment when you're jumping,
8262740	8265740	the game has some leniency on that.
8266740	8271740	Right now, mine doesn't have that, so it will.
8271740	8274740	But at the moment, you have to hit the jump.
8274740	8276740	Both feet have to go down at the exact same moment,
8276740	8278740	otherwise you miss.
8279740	8282740	But I actually threw most of it together.
8282740	8285740	Like, the actual full-length song mode,
8285740	8287740	I actually threw most of it together yesterday.
8287740	8292740	So, because in the regular super multitasking dance minigame,
8292740	8293740	there are no jumps.
8293740	8295740	Because how are you going to do a left-right jump
8295740	8296740	with an analog stick?
8296740	8298740	Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense.
8298740	8301740	It's going to be difficult enough, that's for sure.
8302740	8307740	I watched you play that mode with the controller,
8307740	8309740	because you tweeted OLR and I retweeted it
8309740	8313740	so people could see it, and you had that,
8313740	8315740	like you were playing the dance in the middle
8315740	8317740	on the dance pad using a controller,
8317740	8319740	and I just thought, I was like,
8319740	8324740	way to make a zany, stress-filled game even more stressful.
8324740	8328740	But hey, you can burn calories doing it, so awesome.
8329740	8330740	If it makes you feel any better,
8330740	8333740	you don't have to worry about the middle of the controller,
8333740	8336740	the ABXY, it's just the stuff around it.
8336740	8337740	So, just.
8337740	8339740	I feel much better, thank you.
8341740	8343740	But actually, that's not the only thing
8343740	8345740	I wanted to talk about.
8345740	8347740	I want to talk about a pretty awesome experience
8347740	8350740	I had this week gaming on my Xbox
8350740	8354740	when I actually made the few minutes to do that that I got.
8356740	8361740	So, Forza Horizon 5, you know how great this game is,
8361740	8365740	but the one disappointing thing about it in my eyes,
8365740	8370740	the biggest one, was the fact that I'm still rocking
8370740	8376740	my Xbox One X on my big TV, and when it comes to driving games,
8376740	8378740	I'm a frame rate snob.
8378740	8380740	It has to be 60 frames per second or higher,
8380740	8383740	and I will not settle for less.
8383740	8388740	In fact, that's why I bought my Xbox One X initially.
8388740	8390740	It was to play Forza Horizon 4 at 60 FPS
8390740	8392740	because I knew the performance mode was there,
8392740	8395740	and it was to play Ori in 4K.
8395740	8398740	So, and I still haven't even made the time
8398740	8401740	to get back to the ladder yet,
8401740	8403740	probably partially because I spent 500 hours
8403740	8405740	playing Forza Horizon 4 on it.
8405740	8407740	So, I got my money's worth.
8407740	8411740	And to be clear, there is a 60 frame mode in Forza,
8411740	8414740	but I believe it's only on Series X and maybe S,
8414740	8415740	but not the console.
8415740	8416740	It's on S.
8416740	8417740	Yeah.
8417740	8420740	Yeah, unfortunately, there is absolutely no performance mode
8420740	8425740	in Forza Horizon 5 if you're running it on an Xbox One X,
8425740	8432740	but I actually played Forza Horizon 5
8433740	8439740	on my Xbox One X at 60 frames per second this week.
8439740	8440740	Oh.
8440740	8445740	Using cloud gaming.
8445740	8448740	Oh, clever.
8448740	8453740	Because, first of all, you have to uninstall it from the hard drive.
8453740	8457740	It won't offer you cloud gaming if the game is locally installed,
8457740	8460740	but if you then launch it,
8460740	8464740	you're going to be playing it on an Xbox Series X
8464740	8466740	somewhere in a data center.
8466740	8468740	Right.
8468740	8471740	And you just go to the menu from the initial screen
8471740	8474740	and you turn on performance mode and it restarts
8474740	8479740	and then you get the 60 FPS on a One X.
8479740	8484740	Now, did the artifacting or any of that stuff bother you
8484740	8488740	or were you very pleased with the experience of gaming in the cloud?
8488740	8490740	There was definitely some artifacting.
8490740	8492740	I can't hide that.
8492740	8498740	However, if you've been watching digital cable YouTube videos,
8498740	8501740	you know, for any length of time,
8501740	8504740	you're probably already somewhat used to it,
8504740	8508740	so I actually felt like, you know, the colors weren't as good,
8508740	8511740	they weren't as vibrant, and yeah, the artifacting was there.
8511740	8513740	But you know what?
8513740	8516740	I enjoyed it more than I would have a 30 FPS mode.
8516740	8520740	So for me, and here's the thing,
8520740	8523740	I've used xCloud on my phone before,
8523740	8526740	and on my computer as well,
8526740	8529740	and there was always enough lag on it
8529740	8532740	that I felt like it wasn't really playable,
8532740	8536740	at least if you're moving at 200 miles per hour,
8536740	8539740	because pretty much any lag is unacceptable.
8539740	8544740	But on my console, mind you, it's directly wired to my router,
8544740	8548740	but on my console, it played really, really well.
8548740	8551740	I did not notice the lag.
8551740	8556740	Yeah, the cloud gaming is getting to be more and more impressive technology,
8556740	8559740	and that's really any piece of the cloud gaming I've used,
8559740	8562740	whether it be Stadia, which I know Dark Soccer is very familiar with,
8562740	8565740	or the xCloud, which I think has also been a great experience,
8565740	8569740	or the NVIDIA thing that's also in the cloud as well,
8569740	8571740	you know, have all been pretty good,
8571740	8575740	and it's interesting because I really do think there is a good chunk of gaming
8575740	8577740	that's kind of headed this direction.
8577740	8579740	Now, granted, Internet isn't everywhere yet,
8579740	8581740	but, you know, 10 years from now,
8581740	8585740	we're going to be talking about over-the-air 5G is what we have in our house,
8585740	8587740	and it's faster than cable,
8587740	8590740	and it's going to be very interesting to see what that does for cloud gaming.
8592740	8594740	Yeah, I mean, I have to say,
8594740	8598740	my whole opinion of cloud gaming changed just in this one week,
8598740	8600740	just with that one experience,
8600740	8604740	because that basically told me that this is a viable thing,
8604740	8608740	that, you know, this could be the future.
8608740	8610740	It's crazy.
8610740	8612740	I didn't think I would think this way,
8612740	8616740	but, and this is after I bought an Xbox Series S
8616740	8619740	just so I could play the game at 60 FPS,
8619740	8622740	but it's sitting at my computer desk over there, you know,
8622740	8626740	and I guess I like playing on my TV for some reason.
8626740	8628740	I love that story, though.
8628740	8630740	You should tweet that to Microsoft.
8630740	8633740	I bet they'll be very happy with it, so interesting.
8633740	8635740	And you know what?
8635740	8639740	It's funny because, you know, if you play cloud gaming,
8639740	8641740	a lot of the time it pops up right after,
8641740	8643740	oh, what did you think of this?
8643740	8646740	We want your feedback, and when I tell them,
8646740	8649740	and when I tell them, yes, it was good,
8649740	8651740	they ask, okay, what did you like about it?
8651740	8656740	My use case is not one of the options.
8656740	8660740	Oh, you don't get a box to fill in to put your own thing?
8660740	8665740	No, no, they ask you to pick one of several choices.
8665740	8667740	I thought they let you fill it in.
8667740	8670740	I like the fact that I could play anywhere.
8670740	8672740	I like how it starts immediately.
8672740	8674740	I like how I don't have to install anything.
8674740	8678740	I like that it's giving me access to Series X exclusive features.
8678740	8687740	I really do like that, and yeah, it's pretty sweet.
8687740	8689740	And you know what?
8689740	8695740	I bet when, you know, word spreads about how well this runs,
8695740	8700740	I think the resale value of some of these old VCR Xbox Ones
8700740	8703740	might go up a little bit because, you know,
8703740	8705740	maybe they're not worthless after all.
8705740	8711740	Although I must say, when I got my Series S,
8711740	8717740	I started looking at eBay to see what the resale value of an Xbox One S is.
8717740	8722740	I don't know what the heck is going on with the console market right now
8722740	8724740	because people are just bonkers.
8724740	8729740	They're willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money for Xbox Ones
8729740	8732740	and base PS4s right now.
8732740	8734740	I guess it's because they can't get anything else.
8734740	8739740	But $200 to $300 range, for the previous gen consoles,
8739740	8741740	$200 to $300 range was commonplace.
8741740	8743740	Wow.
8743740	8745740	Yeah.
8745740	8747740	It's bad.
8747740	8750740	Well, while we are, I love that story,
8750740	8753740	and I love what you did for your birthday stream,
8753740	8756740	and I love that we all get to benefit with more bigger, better,
8756740	8758740	super multitasking in the coming months.
8758740	8760740	So if you guys haven't checked out my channel,
8761740	8764740	So if you guys haven't checked it out on Steam already,
8764740	8766740	what the hell are you waiting for?
8766740	8770740	Get on it. Super multitasking available in the storefront.
8770740	8772740	I don't know how to say it.
8772740	8775740	It's like WarioWare, but more.
8775740	8777740	More at once.
8777740	8779740	More at once.
8779740	8782740	YYR, anything else to share with the audience before I let you go?
8782740	8785740	I think I'm tired.
8785740	8787740	All right. All right. Go to bed.
8787740	8789740	All right. Have a good night. Thanks for calling.
8789740	8791740	We're very tired from all that dancing. Get some rest in.
8791740	8793740	All right. Take care, buddy. It's good to hear from you.
8793740	8795740	Great week, everybody.
8795740	8797740	Bye-bye.
8797740	8800740	Great to hear from our pal YYR here on the program.
8800740	8802740	All right.
8802740	8804740	Let me see if we had any other...
8804740	8806740	No, we didn't have any other calls.
8806740	8809740	Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories.
8809740	8811740	No.
8811740	8814740	It's going to start to get more to that slower time of year.
8814740	8816740	I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover next week.
8816740	8818740	We are still going to be here Sunday night.
8818740	8820740	I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover.
8820740	8823740	I really want to invite your questions and discussion topics for us.
8823740	8826740	Mailbag... I'm sorry.
8826740	8828740	The mailbag address is
8828740	8830740	participate at orangeloungeloungeradio.com
8830740	8832740	is the place where you can send us an email.
8832740	8835740	Oh, Bobby Blackall points out the Arcade 1UP Tron.
8835740	8837740	Yes, that's true.
8839740	8841740	Should I talk about this? I don't know.
8841740	8845740	I'm getting a little iffy on if I want to still do London next year.
8846740	8850740	I really, really, really, really want to go to that concert.
8851740	8854740	The thing that's obviously with the recent news
8854740	8857740	that I talked about last week on the show,
8857740	8860740	I'm starting to worry if that might kind of put a damper on things,
8860740	8862740	but what's really putting a damper on things
8862740	8864740	is that COVID is coming back again,
8864740	8867740	and now you look into all the travel restrictions.
8867740	8869740	You want to go over there. You still have to get tested.
8869740	8871740	This is even if you're vaccinated.
8871740	8874740	You still have to get tested on the second day that you're there.
8874740	8877740	So it's like you have to spend money to do that and time to do that.
8877740	8881740	So I'm starting to wonder if I just shouldn't
8881740	8884740	axe that trip and get myself a Tron Arcade 1UP
8884740	8887740	and some of the other things, but we'll see,
8887740	8889740	to be determined on that.
8889740	8893740	I got an Arcade 1UP actually just last week.
8893740	8895740	Oh, yeah. Tell us about this because I saw the tweet.
8895740	8897740	I got the tabletop Dig Dug.
8897740	8899740	Oh, I didn't know it was tabletop.
8899740	8902740	I thought it was the standing one. Oh, that's cool.
8902740	8906740	Yeah, I got the tabletop Dig Dug to go with our tabletop Galaga.
8906740	8908740	Oh, I love that.
8908740	8911740	I didn't know there was a Dig Dug branded one.
8911740	8913740	I imagine it's the same like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man,
8913740	8915740	like all the Namco stuff in it, but that's pretty cool.
8915740	8919740	Yeah, it's just Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.
8919740	8922740	These are a little bit more limited.
8922740	8925740	Oh, oh, not like cocktail tabletop.
8925740	8927740	I know what you're talking about. I wanted that Dig Dug 1.
8927740	8929740	I couldn't find it anywhere. Oh, I want it.
8929740	8934740	They had exactly one left at a Ross Dress for Less.
8934740	8935740	Wow.
8935740	8937740	If I find another.
8937740	8938740	Yeah, let me know.
8938740	8939740	I will grab it for you.
8939740	8942740	I'll have to check those kind of stores in the area to see.
8942740	8947740	Along with the other stuff that I've bought for you that I haven't given you.
8947740	8949740	I still have a thing for you from L.A.
8949740	8950740	That's right.
8950740	8952740	I still have a thing for you from L.A., yeah.
8952740	8954740	I've got things in the pipeline.
8954740	8956740	All right.
8956740	8957740	All right.
8957740	8961740	Well, if there's no other stories, then I think we'll go ahead and wrap it all up for tonight.
8961740	8964740	Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning into Orange Launch Radio and listening to our show.
8964740	8968740	Whether you were here with us live or listening on the podcast feed, thank you for being here.
8968740	8970740	Tell a friend or two about the show.
8970740	8973740	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8973740	8975740	but we need the voices to be here.
8975740	8981740	So, yes, please consider following us on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network.
8981740	8985740	A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Spotify, wherever did you find this show.
8985740	8987740	Those go an awful long way as well.
8987740	8991740	The merch shop is currently closed for maintenance, but we'll be bringing that back soon.
8991740	8995740	Thanks to everyone who's gone out of their way and supported us with that in the past.
8995740	8999740	And we look forward to maybe this will be an opportunity for some new merch in the future.
8999740	9004740	I think that's all I have to say in my little spiel.
9004740	9007740	So, we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap on up.
9007740	9012740	Dark Sakura will be keeping the party going with the after party and her dead by daylight.
9012740	9016740	So, I will go to her first with her final thought.
9016740	9023740	I should probably just play no-ed just for the sake of pissing people off tonight.
9023740	9024740	I might do that.
9024740	9026740	An all no-ed stream. Love it.
9026740	9029740	An all no-ed stream and I want to see who it's going to be the meme.
9029740	9034740	I'll use no-ed and then see if anybody gets a tree trunk up their ass over it.
9034740	9040740	No-ed, haunted ground, I'm trying to think of the other like exposed iron maiden.
9040740	9044740	My pig build is pretty mean as it is.
9044740	9050740	Especially if I do like number two rule set and tamper timer when I don't have the VHS tape.
9050740	9054740	I don't know. I'm pretty mean already.
9054740	9058740	But how about a doctor with no-ed or a Freddy with no-ed?
9058740	9060740	All right. All right.
9060740	9062740	Have fun being sweaty.
9062740	9064740	I will see you in a little bit after the show.
9064740	9068740	Sweaty? That removes the sweat factor altogether.
9068740	9070740	All right. Take care.
9070740	9072740	All right. Bye.
9072740	9076740	All right. And we'll go to Loki for your final thought tonight.
9076740	9081740	My final thought is I'm going to be very busy this week getting the last few episodes put together for my series.
9081740	9085740	And I can't wait to start the new stuff.
9085740	9091740	My final thought I didn't stream as much as last week because I've really been trying to keep make room for Alan to stream.
9091740	9096740	And I've been really into this ingress event that's going on right now and trying to get more exercise.
9096740	9099740	And I hit some really good exercise goals I did yesterday and today.
9099740	9101740	Ten thousand steps. That's five miles.
9101740	9104740	So that's something I'm obviously with everything I've been talking about last week.
9104740	9111740	But some of the signs of me doing good things is showing up already, which is very encouraging because it's only been a couple of weeks.
9111740	9113740	So just y'all keep your fingers and your toes crossed.
9113740	9119740	I can stay on this route because I would love to not that I'm going to kid myself this is going to go away completely,
9119740	9123740	but I'd love to just be in a in a capacity with a little more flexibility.
9123740	9126740	So we'll see. Fingers and toes crossed. Yes.
9126740	9129740	You heard Matt says I didn't participate in community today was traveling.
9129740	9133740	I only got five. I walked five miles and got five shiny shinxes.
9133740	9136740	But that's plenty. I don't I don't need 40.
9136740	9140740	I didn't check in with Shane to see how many he got to maybe check in for after the credits.
9140740	9145740	All right. That is going to do it, though, for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9145740	9148740	Thanks again. We'll see you in seven days for those of you in the states.
9148740	9151740	Have a great Thanksgiving for everybody around the world.
9151740	9156740	We are thankful for you tuning in and supporting our show each and every week.
9156740	9162740	Or even if this is the first week, I'm thankful you got to the end of the show because we had some angries earlier.
9162740	9168740	So I appreciate you guys sticking with it. Happy gaming. Enjoy any of the new games you picked up this week.
9168740	9171740	We'll be back to do it again in seven days. Have a great night, everybody.
