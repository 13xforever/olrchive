00:00.000 --> 00:13.800
This week, if you showed up and Bobby was an hour late or you showed up for Bobby and

00:13.800 --> 00:18.960
got us instead, you probably forgot to set your clocks back or forgot that we did, hemispheres

00:18.960 --> 00:21.480
and countries and the tyranny of clocks, something like that.

00:21.480 --> 00:26.340
For the podcast listeners, it's just another day ending in Y or G if you're Swedish.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.300
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you actual news.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.420
Things like a Squid Game like games, certainly needed social dynamic changes and plenty more

00:34.420 --> 00:35.940
news starting right now on the show.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.260
Rera Gamer has a voice.

00:37.260 --> 00:48.700
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.700
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.700
That's right.

00:51.700 --> 00:59.900
A brand new time zone tonight and we are back with episode number 890 for this November

00:59.900 --> 01:02.540
the 7th of 2021.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.940
And on Twitch, I'm by myself right now.

01:03.940 --> 01:04.940
Why is that?

01:04.940 --> 01:05.940
There we go.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.940
Hello.

01:06.940 --> 01:10.060
I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my incredible co-hosts.

01:10.060 --> 01:13.220
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.220
Hi.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.260
But you know, we're not really in a different time zone.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
We're still Pacific time.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.260
Yeah.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.340
I should have said a different time, not time zone.

01:20.340 --> 01:24.220
But you know, when you're trying to do camera changes with one hand and talking with your

01:24.220 --> 01:25.220
mouth, it's a lot.

01:25.220 --> 01:26.220
It's multitasking.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.220
It's hard.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.220
It's very hard.

01:28.220 --> 01:29.420
I don't need to know what you're doing with one hand, Rob.

01:29.420 --> 01:33.420
I got one hand in my pocket to quote an Alanis Morissette song, but that's all it's doing.

01:33.420 --> 01:38.360
Anyway, DarkSakura, I wanted to start off the show by saying to you happy N7 day.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.400
How did you, how did you spend your N7 day?

01:41.400 --> 01:42.940
I was busy all day.

01:42.940 --> 01:46.740
We did, it was really actually kind of a half work day for me.

01:46.740 --> 01:54.460
I had to, I had a sister meeting this morning and it went two hours instead of one hour,

01:54.460 --> 01:56.340
longer than two hours actually.

01:56.340 --> 01:58.540
Are you back to doing those in person or is it still virtual?

01:58.540 --> 02:04.180
No, we tried and then we went right back to zooming it.

02:04.180 --> 02:11.740
And funny enough, I found that the thing I use for connecting my phone for, not for Twitch,

02:11.740 --> 02:16.900
I use Twitch cam for that, but for discord works in zoom.

02:16.900 --> 02:24.020
So I was able to, but for some reason, zoom doesn't like my headphones maybe because it's

02:24.020 --> 02:29.440
hooked in through my microphone, maybe, but lots of house cleaning and I had to get some

02:29.440 --> 02:41.100
groceries and, and yeah, just too busy today, but I but to celebrate, I did not play any

02:41.100 --> 02:45.260
mass effect because I didn't have time and it still won't run on my Mac.

02:45.260 --> 02:51.500
Well, that's a bummer, but yeah, that legendary edition, uh, I don't, I haven't touched it

02:51.500 --> 02:55.500
myself in, since it really, like it came out, I didn't even beat mass effect one still.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.740
I think Alan did a play through of it, but I never did.

02:58.740 --> 03:02.220
And uh, I was kind of waiting for them to finish patching it because they were still

03:02.220 --> 03:03.780
putting out patches after the fact.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.820
So, um, well, I still haven't done animal crossing either just because of how busy I've

03:07.820 --> 03:08.820
been.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.820
So, Oh my gosh.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.180
There's a lot of people playing that.

03:11.180 --> 03:14.620
I haven't, I haven't gotten around to animal crossing yet either, but I know a lot of people

03:14.620 --> 03:16.260
have been super enjoying that one.

03:16.260 --> 03:20.620
Uh, I want to go to s two and a mat in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday

03:20.620 --> 03:23.400
night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby black will

03:23.400 --> 03:27.100
show at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.100
That's VOG network.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.100
And that's the shoe.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.100
One hundred.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.140
Matt says, I didn't realize it was N seven day until an hour ago.

03:33.140 --> 03:37.740
Um, neither did I, well, not an hour ago, but it was a good chunk into the day until

03:37.740 --> 03:41.260
I realized, I think I was on Twitter and then I realized, Oh yeah, it is.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.260
It's November 7th.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.380
It's N seven day, but I wasn't expecting much this year.

03:45.380 --> 03:49.340
Of course I should backtrack if you don't know what N seven day is, it's a tie into

03:49.340 --> 03:54.700
the game series mass effect, which of course doc soccer and I fan boy and fangirl about,

03:54.700 --> 04:03.220
uh, because, uh, it's an amazing series, um, and N seven refers to like, like the military

04:03.220 --> 04:07.020
kind of special squad sort of thing that's in the game that shepherds apart.

04:07.020 --> 04:12.380
They have like a seven levels of special ops and seven is the top designation.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.600
Kind of like hell.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.340
So you're in the seventh circle of alien hell in a mass effect.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.340
So yeah.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.620
So this is always kind of a special day and usually they drop some mass effect news.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.420
They actually did today, and I don't know if you saw it, dark soccer, but they did put

04:24.420 --> 04:25.420
out a poster.

04:25.420 --> 04:30.100
They put out a new poster for the new game and it doesn't say much, but it kind of hints

04:30.100 --> 04:35.220
that like the geth are strongly involved, which if it's a game in shepherd's universe

04:35.220 --> 04:36.460
would make sense.

04:36.460 --> 04:40.540
Uh, but it, you know, there's like this interesting shadow of like a geth figure that the, you

04:40.540 --> 04:41.940
know, a picture makes out.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.660
So it's kinda, kinda interesting.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.860
But again, I saw that poster and I was like, looks great.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.820
Too bad I won't play it till 2025.

04:48.820 --> 04:52.920
Well, I would rather it take a while to come out and be good.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.920
That is true.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.600
We don't want them to rush it, but it does seem weird to like tease it.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.940
You know, I'm just like, okay, it's like, it's like hyping a Marvel movie that won't

05:00.940 --> 05:03.380
be out for three years, you know, it's, but it is what it is.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.740
I guess people do that now anyway.

05:04.740 --> 05:05.740
All right.

05:05.740 --> 05:06.740
I reckon.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.740
Also say hello.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.980
Welcome back this week to Techmaster Loki.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.700
Welcome back, Loki.

05:11.700 --> 05:16.060
I guess we'll have to wait and see what they come up with for that new game.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.060
And goodbye, Loki.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.060
It was nice.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.820
Uh, well, it wasn't nice having you.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.820
Goodbye.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.820
All right.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.820
Uh, anyway.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.820
Hey, dark soccer.

05:23.820 --> 05:24.820
Let's no, I'm just kidding.

05:24.820 --> 05:25.820
I'm just kidding.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.820
All right.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.820
How was your Halloween?

05:27.820 --> 05:28.820
Loki?

05:28.820 --> 05:29.820
Uh, it was fine.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.820
It was pretty typical.

05:30.820 --> 05:31.820
Took the kids out.

05:31.820 --> 05:34.700
I was reading and got some candy.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.940
Um, it was pretty short this year, so yeah.

05:37.940 --> 05:38.940
Yeah.

05:38.940 --> 05:39.940
Well, that's good.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.900
They ain't getting good candy though.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.900
Time.

05:42.900 --> 05:43.900
No.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.980
Why does, does dad go through the bag and pick out the ones he wants first?

05:47.980 --> 05:53.340
Not really, but like, you know, like tootsie rolls and stuff.

05:53.340 --> 05:57.220
So, uh, they didn't have any, so I had to buy my own.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.220
Like I don't even know.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.060
It's not worth it at that point.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.020
Uh, let's see.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.940
Bobby black Wolfen chat says the kids got some candy.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.540
Loki got lots of candy.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.540
Yes.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.720
Three and a half pounds of candy.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.820
Then the day after Halloween is when you go and you get all the on sale candy.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.880
So yeah, that's how it works.

06:15.880 --> 06:16.880
So yeah.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.180
Um, okay.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.080
What is the game playing behind you tonight?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.340
I don't, I don't recognize it.

06:23.340 --> 06:27.340
I don't know why, but like I was thinking about it today as I was kind of getting ready.

06:27.340 --> 06:31.380
I'm like, well, what do I want to put in my background today?

06:31.380 --> 06:38.740
And just for some reason, my brain being stupid, decided to shout out home improvement.

06:38.740 --> 06:41.680
And I was like, I don't even know if there is a home improvement game, but apparently

06:41.680 --> 06:46.760
there is, there is a home improvement game on the super Nintendo.

06:46.760 --> 06:50.580
It's like home improvement search for tools or I remember it's search for something with

06:50.580 --> 06:54.620
tools, but, um, it looks weird.

06:54.620 --> 06:59.020
Believe it or not, they made a lot of bullshit games on the super Nintendo.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.380
That's why, even though I wasn't sure if that's the case, I'm like, there's a good chance

07:03.380 --> 07:04.540
that it's there.

07:04.540 --> 07:05.540
Yeah.

07:05.540 --> 07:08.900
We hope we hold the super Nintendo in high regard and mostly with good reason, but that,

07:08.900 --> 07:14.420
you know, every system has its clunkers, you know, and, and there you go the whole game,

07:14.420 --> 07:17.580
you know, he is basically fighting with tools and it's great.

07:17.580 --> 07:18.660
He has a nail gun.

07:18.660 --> 07:22.180
Looks like he's using a saw the fight off dinosaurs or something.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.860
So, um, I'm down for that.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.840
I need to see that in the awful block.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.260
My one little weird, quirky thing.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.540
I know I've mentioned this on the show before, but it's been a while.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.540
Say it again.

07:31.540 --> 07:35.420
My one little weird, quirky thing is that, um, I went to school with that kid's brother,

07:35.420 --> 07:39.740
uh, the Jonathan Taylor Thomas, they used to live where I grew up, grew up and the kid's

07:39.740 --> 07:41.420
brother was in my math class.

07:41.420 --> 07:46.500
So yeah, it's just, it's, it's a small world, I guess, but yeah, I guess everybody's, you

07:46.500 --> 07:48.780
know, got weird ties to someone famous like that.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.680
But even I, you know, obviously I, we weren't like friends or anything, so I didn't really

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
keep in touch or whatever.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.860
I had friends that were friends with him, but, um, I, uh, didn't really keep in touch.

07:58.860 --> 08:02.100
Even I was wondering what the hell ever happened to that kid?

08:02.100 --> 08:05.780
Like, cause you know, after home improvement, he kind of disappeared, right?

08:05.780 --> 08:10.180
And then I guess they, they finally found him a few years ago, but yeah, it was funny.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.300
He was here at this bar the whole time.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.700
Oh, did you check under the rock?

08:14.700 --> 08:15.700
All right.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
Anyway, uh, let's see.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.340
Bobby Blackwell in chat says, I think home improvement has been on games done quick before.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.340
Oh, I'm sure.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.300
As Jonah and Matt says, yeah, I remember the game now.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.820
I remember renting it.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.380
It's trash with 16 bit, Tim Allen, grunting sound effects.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.380
Oh God.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.380
That's the best part though.

08:30.380 --> 08:31.380
Like seriously.

08:31.380 --> 08:36.500
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I bought the last super Nintendo game ever officially released

08:36.500 --> 08:38.440
in North America and it's so bad.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.380
It's Frogger, but it's a bad version of Frogger.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.380
Yikes.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.380
That's every version of Frogger.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.380
Except for the arcade.

08:45.380 --> 08:51.620
Yeah, the original and Frogger two, three deep on the Commodore 64 was pretty good.

08:51.620 --> 08:57.220
So anyway, okay, Loki, I have to ask you about this because you weren't here last week, so

08:57.220 --> 08:59.060
you didn't get to do last week's news.

08:59.060 --> 09:03.340
But when this story came up, like everybody was like, we need Loki here to talk about

09:03.340 --> 09:04.340
this.

09:04.340 --> 09:09.900
So I'm going to ask you now VR edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that meta is

09:09.900 --> 09:11.460
talking about.

09:11.460 --> 09:15.660
I already, now for the podcast listeners, you can't see his face, but you can imagine

09:15.660 --> 09:17.540
his face.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.500
I'm not buying a quest for this.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.580
Like it's stupid.

09:20.580 --> 09:27.500
Like they want, they want you to buy the quest to, to play San Andreas, which is super damn

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
old.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
Like I, like I get it.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Yeah.

09:30.500 --> 09:37.020
It'll be cool in VR, but let's be honest, like if I want to play that in VR, I'm pretty

09:37.020 --> 09:39.380
sure modders can make a version that's in VR.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.260
I'm sure that they've already made a version that's in VR.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.260
Well, okay.

09:43.260 --> 09:48.660
But to, to be fair, like the conversion of like forcing VR on games that weren't designed

09:48.660 --> 09:50.720
for VR usually stinks.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.620
Like it's a five minute novelty and then it's like, okay, this is garbage.

09:54.620 --> 10:00.660
Like case in point, whoever modded the 8-bit Nintendo Legend of Zelda to run in VR, like,

10:00.660 --> 10:01.660
and I'm not knocking this person.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
Of course people want to see that.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.820
That was like its own kind of independent thing.

10:04.820 --> 10:05.820
I get that.

10:05.820 --> 10:06.820
Yeah.

10:06.820 --> 10:07.820
And it doesn't need to be there.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.140
I think it's just such a gimmick.

10:10.140 --> 10:17.260
Like, like it really is just such a gimmick to try to sell the Quest 2, which is stupid

10:17.260 --> 10:23.060
because like I have a Rift S and like, I guess it's just not being supported anymore.

10:23.060 --> 10:26.220
Even though I think it's probably more powerful than the Quest 2.

10:26.220 --> 10:32.980
I mean, after all it's running on a PC, which is arguably more powerful than the Quest 2.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.060
But sure, whatever.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.060
Let's wall it behind.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.060
I'm not buying another con.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.060
I'm not buying it.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.300
Sorry.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.300
You know, I don't care how great it is.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.620
I'll just not play it.

10:42.620 --> 10:43.620
So whatever.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.780
I mean, it's, it's fine.

10:45.780 --> 10:50.660
Even like, I think we, they have like the remasters that they just, you know, they talked

10:50.660 --> 10:54.740
about coming out and stuff and they actually, they, at least they did something with that.

10:54.740 --> 10:57.940
At least the graphics look a little bit better.

10:57.940 --> 11:03.660
Not great, but I mean the best, I guess they can do, but it's just very minimal effort.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.260
Like I just don't, I don't care.

11:06.460 --> 11:11.300
Bobby does want to clarify that the meta will no longer support PC VR, mobile VR is where

11:11.300 --> 11:12.800
they see the market share.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.780
And also wants to clarify, he still does not own a Quest.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.380
The Rift has been discontinued.

11:17.380 --> 11:21.300
So just to where are we, how, so we know where VR is at.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.900
You know what?

11:22.900 --> 11:24.460
I don't care, Facebook.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.380
It works on PC.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.700
There's other VR pro there.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.700
You know what?

11:28.700 --> 11:31.940
There's, I don't need a walled garden for VR.

11:31.940 --> 11:32.940
Okay.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.940
I don't.

11:33.940 --> 11:38.460
Honestly, like it's just, there's so much stuff on scene.

11:38.460 --> 11:47.460
Like really, like I don't need to play San Andreas again for like how many times now,

11:47.460 --> 11:48.460
like I don't care.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.980
I'm not going to wait for them to put it out on VR.

11:50.980 --> 11:55.380
Now if it was a brand new Grand Theft Auto, which they really should be doing, like, let's

11:55.380 --> 12:00.620
just put it this way, like develop a brand new Grand Theft Auto for the Quest 2 and then,

12:00.620 --> 12:03.460
and then make that a VR only game, then that would be cool.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.300
I'm sure they're developing a new Grand Theft Auto is just taking forever.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.300
Yeah.

12:07.300 --> 12:13.100
But I understand that, but like before, like there's been lower tier effort, uh, games

12:13.100 --> 12:20.900
that have been put out by Rockstar, like they had a Grand Theft Auto for, uh, the DS, Chinatown

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
Wars came up last week.

12:21.900 --> 12:22.900
Yeah.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.900
Yeah.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
Yeah.

12:24.900 --> 12:25.900
So like something like that.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.980
Um, I mean the PSP ports are pretty good.

12:27.980 --> 12:28.980
Those had multiplayer.

12:29.020 --> 12:32.500
That's why I started multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto with, was the PSP stuff.

12:32.500 --> 12:38.220
Um, I just don't like, I would not, I would so not buy a Quest 2 for that.

12:38.220 --> 12:44.100
Like I would just absolutely not, not worth it at all, but more power to them, I guess.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.740
I just think this it's just stupid.

12:46.740 --> 12:50.500
Bobby Blackwoven chat says there's not enough market share of VR to make a new Grand Theft

12:50.500 --> 12:51.660
Auto for VR only.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.180
I do agree with that.

12:53.180 --> 12:57.740
And follows up saying Valve made a brand new Half-Life just for VR and everyone lost their

12:57.740 --> 12:58.740
shit.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.860
So, um, going back to that first thing that Bobby said there, uh, I thought this was a

13:02.860 --> 13:06.860
good follow up comment and I haven't read this chatter before, so welcome and hello

13:06.860 --> 13:11.980
XC Friesz, I hope I said the right XC Friesz, sorry, I'm not sure how to pronounce that.

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
My bad.

13:12.980 --> 13:16.700
Uh, says, uh, I would like to get into VR, but terrified of buying something that will

13:16.700 --> 13:19.260
be obsolete or abandoned soon after.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.620
And I think that's a damn good point, especially when you consider, okay, well, Meta just walked

13:22.620 --> 13:24.260
away from the rift.

13:24.260 --> 13:28.220
That's why for me, and I know Meta's got something else in the works, blah, blah, blah, blah,

13:28.220 --> 13:31.220
blah, blah, blah, but for me, that's why I'm like, you know what?

13:31.220 --> 13:35.860
I'm just going to wait for PlayStation 5 VR because you know, it's coming, you know, it's

13:35.860 --> 13:36.980
going to be a good baseline.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.260
You know, it's going to be solid.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.940
It's going to have a lot of games on it for gamers.

13:40.940 --> 13:45.660
Whereas the Meta stuff will probably have a lot of other crap that Facebook wants to

13:45.660 --> 13:47.900
push on it in some games too.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
So you know what?

13:48.900 --> 13:53.260
I'm just going to hang out for PlayStation 5 VR because I feel like the good baseline

13:53.260 --> 13:57.940
for a gamer who wants VR is a game console doing VR.

13:57.940 --> 13:58.940
And so that's for me.

13:58.940 --> 14:03.660
The only positive I see with the Quest 2 is that you don't have, you're not really docked

14:03.660 --> 14:06.700
to like a PC.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.940
But really like anywhere in my house, I don't have enough room to do VR.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.300
Like that's why I don't do VR.

14:11.300 --> 14:15.700
That's why my, you know, Rift S is still in the box over here and my PlayStation VR is

14:15.700 --> 14:17.060
in a box in another room.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.100
You could try to do VR, but you'll trip on a toy.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.380
You'll trip on a cat.

14:21.380 --> 14:26.580
Yeah, so, so cat updates since I've been gone for a few weeks.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.380
She's not doing great.

14:28.380 --> 14:36.940
She's got, she, she is, health is definitely deteriorating, so she is, she is confined

14:36.940 --> 14:38.280
to the kitchen now.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.780
She does not, she, well, she still can't hear.

14:42.780 --> 14:46.220
And now I think she can't see out of one side.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.760
And so she, and she has brain issues.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.260
So she circles and around and around and around and can't find things.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.960
So then she's, you know, missing her litter box and stuff like that.

14:57.960 --> 15:02.880
So she's, she sleeps now under my desk.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.040
I don't know where she's wandered off to actually.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.400
Well there's a lot of love.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
She's under my wheels.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.300
Okay, please don't.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.920
There's a lot of love pouring out from the chat right now.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.760
Send Stella some love from all of us, cause that's always difficult to hear.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.120
Uh, I, did they say what the issue was?

15:18.120 --> 15:23.200
Cause it sounds like almost like some sort of, um, brain.

15:23.600 --> 15:28.080
Well, it is, but they can't do, she wants it still for an X-ray for her head.

15:28.240 --> 15:31.900
And I'm not paying $3,000 to do advanced imaging at like Davis or something like

15:31.900 --> 15:37.960
that, so it's probably something like a tumor or something, who knows, but we're

15:37.960 --> 15:44.980
just keeping her comfortable, I guess for now, you tell me a people, a person has

15:44.980 --> 15:46.780
these problems and I'm like, Oh, that sucks.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.220
She told me a cat has these problems.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.540
Like, like, no, I get very emotional.

15:52.020 --> 15:56.060
So, but yeah, she's, she's been like, cause we, we had, it was weird.

15:56.060 --> 15:59.900
Like she was like going to the bathroom behind the couch and stuff like that.

15:59.900 --> 16:03.500
And just like, kind of like I noticed her circling around a bunch.

16:03.540 --> 16:06.300
And so I don't think she can see out of the one side cause I can kind of come

16:06.300 --> 16:10.380
up beside her and just like, Wave my hand in front of her and she doesn't see it.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.400
Um, but she sees me on the other side.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.760
And so she'll, she'll either follow the wall to, you know, kind of clockwise

16:16.760 --> 16:19.560
around the room or she'll circle around.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.960
Um, I don't know.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.280
Well, she probably appreciates you giving her some cuddles.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.760
So keep at it a little bit.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.040
Yeah.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.280
She's, she's got her bed underneath my desk, so she's always with me all day long.

16:30.280 --> 16:35.240
And, um, you know, and keeping her locked up in, in the kitchen is good because

16:35.240 --> 16:36.880
she's not getting lost in the house.

16:37.480 --> 16:37.600
Yeah.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.740
Um, so, all right.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.720
Oh, unfortunately, yeah.

16:42.040 --> 16:42.480
All right.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.880
We've been dealing with the last few weeks.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.080
All right.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.080
Tough topic, but let's try to move on.

16:47.080 --> 16:51.200
We're going to move on into, uh, some video game news going on around the world

16:51.200 --> 16:55.240
and get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about a company I talk a lot

16:55.240 --> 16:59.680
about on this show because I play a lot of their games, it's Niantic and Niantic.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.560
You know, what's interesting just a couple of weeks ago on the show, we had talked

17:02.560 --> 17:06.360
about how Niantic will not be moving forward with the Settlers of Catan game,

17:06.680 --> 17:08.360
uh, that they never released here.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.040
They released it in other countries.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.600
I think Australia, New Zealand was kind of the biggest, um, market they put it out

17:13.600 --> 17:17.560
in, uh, and the Catan game was out there for a while, but they did not continue

17:17.560 --> 17:20.400
development of the game and they canceled it effectively.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.680
Um, they may reuse some of the ideas somewhere else.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.920
It sounded like to me, you know, and again, this is an interpretation.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.160
This is not something they said, but it sounded like to me, them and the Catan

17:31.160 --> 17:32.440
people were not seeing eye to eye.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.680
The Catan license was likely expensive because Catan people didn't want to

17:35.680 --> 17:38.920
continue with it because they didn't see a new Pokemon go in it or something.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.760
Um, so that's what it sounded like.

17:41.160 --> 17:47.160
Um, kind of a little bit surprising that God, not even a month later, uh, here we

17:47.160 --> 17:50.360
are Niantic is going to be shutting down a game that did launch and launched

17:50.360 --> 17:50.920
everywhere.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.600
Uh, and this was a partnership to be fair with Portkey games.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.760
So it's not just Niantic shutting it down.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.640
Um, but certainly Niantic's name was involved with Harry Potter, Wizard's

18:00.640 --> 18:01.160
Unite.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.480
Um, Harry Potter, Wizard's Unite was kind of the game that came out after Pokemon

18:05.520 --> 18:08.240
Go had a lot of similarities to Pokemon Go.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.080
Certainly instead of capturing Pokemon, you were capturing what?

18:11.080 --> 18:16.840
Like spirits, pages, ghosts, things from the Harry Potter universe, but it did

18:16.840 --> 18:21.800
have a pretty neat battle system that Pokemon Go didn't have instead of like

18:21.800 --> 18:26.840
tapping at gyms, you actually had kind of like your, um, you know, MMO triad of

18:26.840 --> 18:30.760
healer tank, you know, DPS kind of thing going on where you were taking on

18:31.000 --> 18:31.560
monsters.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.880
Um, I played the game for a little bit.

18:33.960 --> 18:39.240
Um, I got a little turned off to a lot of Harry Potter related things when, uh, the

18:39.240 --> 18:42.760
author of the books started her social media bullshit, and I'll let you do your

18:42.760 --> 18:43.760
own research on that.

18:44.080 --> 18:49.520
Um, and my conclusion was that, you know what, I, I don't know how much I want to

18:49.520 --> 18:54.320
be like, yeah, I'm super in Harry Potter right now, which sucks because there's a

18:54.320 --> 18:58.200
lot of people that work on these games that do not share the same viewpoints of

18:58.200 --> 18:58.800
the author.

18:59.040 --> 19:04.640
But when she's out there just saying what she's saying, it's very hard to drop

19:04.640 --> 19:06.960
money into the game, knowing that she's getting money in her pocket.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.240
Um, I just got really bored with it.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.480
And honestly, there's that too.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.280
Like the grind was only good for so long.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.760
Apparently the game got a lot better with the COVID changes that they made.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.720
That's what I heard from the people that were still playing it at that point, um,

19:21.720 --> 19:23.280
that they really added a lot to the game.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.000
They finally added some stuff that probably should have been there when it

19:26.000 --> 19:28.280
launched with some of the, um, Epic bosses.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.240
Like you could take out Umbridge and I don't know all the characters, but you

19:31.240 --> 19:34.400
know, some of the, some of the big, big characters, but unfortunately, uh, too

19:34.400 --> 19:39.360
little, too late, I suppose, because the game is going offline on January 31st,

19:39.400 --> 19:40.560
2022.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.360
It will disappear from all the marketplaces December 6th.

19:44.720 --> 19:50.320
In the meantime, go hog because rewards and cool down times will be, uh, I'm

19:50.320 --> 19:52.600
sorry, increased rewards, decreased cool down times.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.280
Basically, you know, they're throwing everything at you to enjoy the game.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.480
Uh, while it's, it's lasting bosses events, they will continue going

20:00.480 --> 20:01.880
live until the end of January.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.800
If you spent money on the game, though, too bad.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.160
The money's been spent, the checks have been cashed.

20:07.320 --> 20:11.080
You will not be getting that money back unless there is a law in your country or

20:11.080 --> 20:13.760
something where you must, uh, in the U S ain't one of them.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.040
So, uh, there you go.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.120
Um, it's closing.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.280
Uh, the game had been released in June of 2019.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.160
Honest to God, it felt like a lot longer.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.760
I felt like that game had been out for at least at least three years, not two, but,

20:27.800 --> 20:29.200
uh, there it is very long.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.240
Yeah, it really doesn't.

20:30.240 --> 20:35.960
And so I don't know, maybe COVID could partially be to blame for that, but I kind

20:35.960 --> 20:38.240
of go back to, it wasn't very popular.

20:38.240 --> 20:43.600
I think like, unfortunately we released it and like Ingress was, it was all right.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.560
Um, everyone's really in the Pokemon go and then.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.640
Wizards of the United seem to be kind of like a third wheel.

20:49.880 --> 20:53.040
It's like, I think people tried it and they were like, eh, that's fine.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.760
But like, it just didn't have the same power.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.760
Um, Mike Defton chat says, technically it's more WB games shutting down this

20:59.760 --> 21:01.400
game rather than Niantic though.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.080
I believe that to be true.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.600
I believe this is more port key games decisions, and maybe they didn't want to

21:06.600 --> 21:09.600
keep paying to license Niantic light ship.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.960
The, all the portal network, what used to be the Ingress portal network, that is all

21:14.000 --> 21:19.600
now Niantic light ship, and that is their big, uh, platform of all, like your parks,

21:19.800 --> 21:24.240
your play structures apart, all that shit that was submitted by mostly Ingress

21:24.240 --> 21:28.440
players, and now a good chunk of Pokemon go players, especially in, um, countries

21:28.440 --> 21:31.720
outside the U S uh, that is all now on Niantic light ship.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.240
And actually it's interesting.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.160
A friend of mine who, you know, has played all the, is just like me.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.800
Like I have, you know, it's a lot of my Ingress friends are like me and that they

21:40.800 --> 21:41.760
play all these games.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.760
They will try all of these games at least once.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.840
We, we just did a walk this weekend.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.280
We were all playing Pikmin and doing a walk while we were playing Ingress.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.160
Like we're just all kind of in that same mindset.

21:51.520 --> 21:56.920
And one of them said to me, you know, um, WB and Warner brothers, porky probably

21:56.920 --> 22:00.280
just didn't want to keep paying the fees for Niantic light ship and want to keep

22:00.280 --> 22:04.520
licensing that you add that into Harry Potter's licensing fees.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.520
That's an expensive game to keep going.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.320
And for what?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.240
And I kind of agree.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.720
I think he hit the nail on the head.

22:10.720 --> 22:15.040
I think it's not just the Harry Potter fee, but now Niantic fee that goes into

22:15.040 --> 22:18.720
this as co-developer, I just don't think the game was worth it to keep running.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.440
It wasn't selling enough of the microtransactions, especially in a COVID

22:22.440 --> 22:22.880
world.

22:23.560 --> 22:24.640
Uh, and that's that.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.320
And that is, and as I expressed last week, that is kind of my fear with the Pikmin

22:29.320 --> 22:35.000
game, the Pikmin game I'm actually rather enjoying because it is a low pressure,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.840
low, um, intensity kind of game.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.520
You can kind of set it and forget it a lot more with Pikmin than you do the other

22:41.520 --> 22:42.240
Niantic games.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.480
Um, but the microtransactions make no sense at all.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.120
None.

22:47.640 --> 22:53.360
And, uh, I just, I feel like, not that I am encouraging Pikmin to put more stuff

22:53.360 --> 22:56.920
for more microtransactions in the game because I don't really want that.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.840
But at the same time, I also realize, you know, developers have to get paid from

23:00.840 --> 23:01.520
somewhere.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.000
So I'd like there to be something worthwhile for them to toss a coin to.

23:05.040 --> 23:09.960
And I don't think that exists in Pikmin Bloom right now and the Harry Potter game

23:09.960 --> 23:14.600
at least once in a while, once in a while, I would say I probably gave 15 bucks, 10

23:14.600 --> 23:18.920
bucks to Wizards Unite when I was actually playing it when it first came out.

23:19.560 --> 23:26.080
So I, it's, I just hope that doesn't kill the Pikmin game that there's, it's, it

23:26.080 --> 23:28.960
doesn't make money because I really don't see how the Pikmin game is going to make

23:28.960 --> 23:31.120
money in its current state anyway.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.320
So, all right.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.320
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.800
Um, yeah, Questbuster points out Pikmin Bloom was just rolled out.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.560
There's a Transformers game as well.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.200
They might have decided to shutter the game to save on costs and push resources to

23:46.200 --> 23:46.840
other projects.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.960
I believe I could be wrong.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.040
Somebody should fact check me on this, but I believe the Transformers game is like

23:54.440 --> 23:57.600
the Harry Potter game where somebody else is developing it and using Niantic

23:57.600 --> 23:58.920
Lightship in it.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.040
I could be wrong.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.080
Uh, as Joe and Hunter Mattis pointing out that Niantic is really investing in Pikmin

24:04.080 --> 24:07.560
Bloom, uh, this is probably Nintendo as well.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.760
They've bought some serious airtime and commercials for it, being seen the

24:10.760 --> 24:13.360
commercials for prime during prime time, which isn't cheap.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.640
You didn't see that with Pokemon Go for a while or at all with Pikmin.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.160
Last I checked the Pikmin Bloom is number one in the like adventure games category.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.400
So, I mean, it's paying off.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.600
It's, it's not 2016 Pokemon Go.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.320
Nothing ever will be again, but Pikmin seems to be doing all right.

24:31.840 --> 24:36.000
But is it, you know, it's getting the installs, but is it making money?

24:37.200 --> 24:37.720
I don't know.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.280
I guess maybe players are probably buying that first timer starter kit thing, but I

24:41.280 --> 24:43.000
don't know if they're getting it, uh, beyond that.

24:43.000 --> 24:43.520
Who knows?

24:44.040 --> 24:47.840
Um, Mike Defton chat says, don't know if this is coming up later, but now you have

24:47.840 --> 24:48.760
a Niantic ID.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.720
No, I did not show all that for later.

24:50.720 --> 24:54.920
I'm glad you did bring that up because, um, yeah, everybody that's played a Niantic

24:54.920 --> 24:59.680
game before is now getting emails to reserve your Niantic ID, but we kind of

24:59.680 --> 25:00.520
knew this was coming.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.960
If you looked at the acquisitions Niantics made, they've been wanting to build a

25:03.960 --> 25:06.040
social network around this AR gaming.

25:06.040 --> 25:13.440
And I, I really think Niantic wants to be in a place like Blizzard, but obviously all

25:13.440 --> 25:15.720
this current stuff we've been talking about Blizzard accepted.

25:15.720 --> 25:16.320
Don't go there.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.080
That's not what I mean.

25:17.320 --> 25:21.240
I'm talking about like battle net and all the Blizzard infrastructure and how those

25:21.240 --> 25:22.200
games tie together.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.000
And you kind of talk to friends through games and stuff, and they've kind of built

25:25.000 --> 25:26.640
that experience on PC.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.880
I think that's what Niantic wants in the mobile world.

25:29.240 --> 25:33.160
And they think Pokemon go is going to get them there and it just well might to be

25:33.160 --> 25:33.560
honest.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.640
And if they can get Pikmin bloom to catch on huge too, that'll be more people for the

25:37.640 --> 25:39.360
social network and that'll catch on as well.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.480
But Harry Potter wasn't it.

25:43.240 --> 25:49.800
So XC freeze and chat says, I wonder if WWE would be a good license to pick up for

25:49.800 --> 25:50.320
Niantic.

25:50.520 --> 25:55.680
I'm not sure how that would go into the real world very well, but, uh, yeah, anything's

25:55.680 --> 25:56.080
possible.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.720
I think there's a lot of different licenses.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.920
People would like to see Niantic pick up and go with, but Harry Potter no longer going

26:01.920 --> 26:02.680
to be one of them.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.960
The game is closing.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.120
So that's that.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.560
And again, yeah, I th I don't think any of us are like super surprised.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.680
I feel sorry for my friends that grinded to 60 in that game.

26:12.120 --> 26:17.920
I think if this is what I think would be nice, but I'm not expecting it to happen.

26:18.800 --> 26:24.400
If Niantic is launching a social network and if achievements are to be part of that

26:24.400 --> 26:27.840
network, which I've been led to believe from some of the tea leaves and the stories that

26:27.840 --> 26:32.320
have come out, it would be nice for the people that played Harry Potter wizard tonight to

26:32.320 --> 26:37.040
have some sort of legacy achievement on their profile before they ax the game.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.280
But because it's technically port key, and I don't know how that ties in.

26:41.640 --> 26:46.120
I, that may not actually happen, but I do feel bad for those that, you know, really the

26:46.120 --> 26:49.120
grind to level 60 in that game, no fucking joke.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.080
That's a grind.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.360
So, um, it would be nice if people had something to show for it besides Womp Womp, but

26:55.360 --> 26:58.880
that's the reality of mobile games.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.960
Your fave may go away someday.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.160
Anyway, let's move on.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.800
Uh, I talked a little bit about my gaming week in there, but I have more, but we'll

27:07.800 --> 27:10.320
talk, go around the table and talk about our gaming weeks.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.320
So let's go to Dark Sakura as we usually do first and talk about your gaming week.

27:14.320 --> 27:14.800
Dark Sakura.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.840
Pretty uneventful, actually.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.640
I just played, um, Dead by Daylight.

27:19.320 --> 27:19.880
Really?

27:20.440 --> 27:23.840
Um, oh, and I played Mandalorian Pinball, so that was it.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.960
Um, I was going to do Animal Crossing.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
Um, real life has happened.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.400
I have had so many projects that I've needed to wrap up that it's not even funny.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.880
So just Dead by Daylight.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.400
Real life happens.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.120
Where's, um, where's Fantasian at?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.240
You finished part two, right?

27:42.240 --> 27:43.680
Oh yeah, I did play Fantasian.

27:43.680 --> 27:44.520
I did play Fantasian.

27:44.920 --> 27:50.040
Um, I am at just this really grindy spot and I'm trying to do as many different

27:50.040 --> 27:57.880
sub missions as I can, but I think I need to buff up my people quite a bit more.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.880
It says, oh, you can do this level 42.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.400
Bullshit.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.240
This is like this one attack that's just like completely ridiculous.

28:05.280 --> 28:09.160
And like, I think I want to get my guys up to like 50 before I do it.

28:09.200 --> 28:09.400
Yeah.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.360
Whenever I see a warning like that, I'm like, no, I'll get to 45.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.560
I've been able until this match to do things early.

28:18.360 --> 28:18.760
Oh, interesting.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.560
Kind of like how I did with Final Fantasy, uh, 10-2, not with 10-2.

28:22.760 --> 28:27.640
Yeah, actually, yeah, it was actually both with 10 and 10-2 that I would just rush

28:27.640 --> 28:33.240
through everything kind of outwit, you know, I guess the enemies.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.160
And then I would finally get to a point where I couldn't do that because

28:38.160 --> 28:39.800
it was all a matter of a power game.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.120
And that's where I am on Fantation.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.680
Um, and then how's how's Dead by Daylight been going?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.480
You enjoying the Halloween event?

28:50.360 --> 28:50.920
I am.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.320
Um, I love stepping on pumpkins before the salty survivors can.

28:56.440 --> 29:02.120
Um, I've actually had just like some funny people, like just like automatically

29:02.120 --> 29:03.160
it's like, Hey, let's farm.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
I'm like, okay, let's farm.

29:04.600 --> 29:13.160
I made, um, new Twitch emotes for my channel that are very on point for me.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.760
I have made a pig, a no boop and a boop.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.480
Cause the no boop is no booping without consent.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.680
You must always ask your pig before you boop her.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.360
Which, which, but you can't chat in the game.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.840
So you have to use nonverbal cues to do that.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.160
Exactly.

29:30.160 --> 29:34.120
If that pig growls at you, run, run.

29:34.240 --> 29:34.720
All right.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.840
Uh, let's go to Loki.

29:36.840 --> 29:37.800
You have a couple of weeks.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.000
I saw you had a new Minecraft video this week over on your YouTube channel at

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Loki, OLR, plug, plug, plug, plug.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.600
I did have a new Minecraft video.

29:44.600 --> 29:49.040
So I finished the Ninjago city, uh, build that I was doing.

29:49.040 --> 29:53.560
I got to add to it and I've been, uh, playing on multiple servers recently.

29:53.560 --> 29:59.280
So it's, I've wasted a few days just playing Minecraft instead

29:59.280 --> 30:00.440
of making stuff for Minecraft.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.920
Um, so I'll be doing, uh, some more stuff for that soon.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.240
I've been in the design process for that.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.280
I know what I wanted to make.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.240
I just have to design it.

30:08.760 --> 30:15.880
And then, um, I played a little bit of, uh, Poppy's playtime chapter one.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.400
This is the new hotness as far as a horror games go.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.240
So it's,

30:20.240 --> 30:23.000
Oh God, I saw someone streaming this the other night.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.440
It looked fucking scary.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.160
It's like, it's like, it's got a five nights vibe because it's all

30:28.160 --> 30:29.520
like the plate, like play things.

30:29.520 --> 30:29.880
Right.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.200
But it's like, she was in an event, like climbing around the vent and

30:33.200 --> 30:35.440
like the little, Oh my God, I couldn't play this.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.360
I could not play this.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.920
Uh, I do like it.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.600
It reminds me a lot of a little bit, like, uh, the puzzle solving and

30:43.600 --> 30:46.240
portal because of the mechanics that they have in it.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.640
So it's pretty fun, but yeah, there's, it's definitely more of like a

30:49.680 --> 30:51.720
scary, almost FNAF type game.

30:52.120 --> 30:56.240
I'm curious to see how this compares to like, say, uh, the

30:56.240 --> 30:57.720
new FNAF game coming out.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.080
So, um, curious to see how that is.

31:00.480 --> 31:06.000
And then, uh, aside from that, I played a little bit of Orna

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
because I got a new phone.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.960
So I was just messing around with that to see how much it's changed.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.160
It's changed quite a bit.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.600
Um, yeah, not very interested in it though.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.880
It's more of like, you know, I'm sitting here, kids are doing piano

31:18.880 --> 31:19.880
and I have nothing to do.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.880
I've run out of internet to look at and play Orna for a sec.

31:23.280 --> 31:28.480
Um, yeah, I don't know something to talk about, not having the same power.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.280
Um, a couple of things I did want to mention though, cause I

31:31.280 --> 31:32.400
haven't gotten to mention it yet.

31:32.400 --> 31:36.280
So, uh, the game that you guys know called the pixel poops.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.440
Number two is being featured in a magazine.

31:39.560 --> 31:45.760
So the next issue of cool shit magazine, Bobby brought this up on his show.

31:45.800 --> 31:46.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.760
Well, it was the week we were out.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.080
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.880
So cool shit magazine, which is I think a UK publication, uh, somewhat

31:52.880 --> 31:55.880
indie, they cover like retro gaming and.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.200
Um, stuff like that.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.760
And so they're going to have, they had like a kind of a giveaway thing where,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.760
uh, the guy was running an ad, a one page ad, and he was also raffling

32:07.760 --> 32:11.880
off, I guess, um, a couple like preview spots.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.480
And so he, I got one of the previous spots, so he's going to cover the

32:15.480 --> 32:20.080
game as a preview and like play through it and stuff and like, talk about that.

32:20.320 --> 32:24.680
And then also at the same time, there's the, I want to say it's a Midwest

32:24.920 --> 32:29.960
Midwest gaming conference or convention or something like that, a gaming classic

32:30.000 --> 32:35.600
Midwest gaming classic there's the folks at, uh, nest maker that are there as well.

32:35.640 --> 32:41.040
And they have, they're still in beta and it's not really open to the public yet

32:41.080 --> 32:44.920
retro verse site, which is going to be featuring all of the nest maker games

32:44.920 --> 32:45.800
that people have made.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.640
And of course, one of those being pixel poops, number two.

32:48.840 --> 32:53.040
So there's a chance that people that are at Midwest gaming classic or we're at

32:53.080 --> 32:55.600
that, got a chance to play pixel poops number two.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.200
So that's great.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.720
I've been getting emails on that.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.200
Like, did you give them my email?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.240
I've been getting emails on that, but I'm like, oh, that's nice.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.400
But it's like too far for me to really travel out there on a moment's notice.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.880
But I've been seeing the, I didn't realize that was tied to your or either

33:07.880 --> 33:10.920
that, or it's a big enough thing where it's a big, it's a big convention.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.440
Wow.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.480
It's not just, yeah.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
I don't know how the hell they got my email, but cool.

33:15.080 --> 33:15.840
They had a booth.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.200
Yeah.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.200
So they had a booth and there's some of the developers that also had booths there.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.400
So one of them must be a listener.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.640
So one of them, that's it.

33:22.640 --> 33:23.800
One of them is a listener, I bet.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.480
So shout out.

33:25.160 --> 33:25.360
Yeah.

33:25.360 --> 33:29.040
So I'm definitely have to pick up a copy of that magazine once it comes out.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.920
Um, I don't know how to pick it up.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.120
Maybe Barnes and Noble has something like that.

33:33.120 --> 33:33.520
I don't know.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.680
I don't know how wide their publication is.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.960
Uh, might be able to order from Amazon UK.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.720
Sometimes they'll ship to the U S and sometimes, uh, Amazon Canada will ship.

33:42.760 --> 33:47.640
We also have some very kind listeners in the UK who may reach out to you on Twitter

33:47.680 --> 33:49.720
and maybe can help you arrange something like that.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.560
So at low key.

33:50.600 --> 33:55.120
Also, I think the guy has, uh, yeah, so they do have an actual website as well.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.720
Um, which I'll link in chat here.

33:58.080 --> 34:02.160
Um, so they actually, I think they sell through the website as well.

34:02.440 --> 34:02.800
Nice.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.320
But, uh, I really want to see that.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.880
I mean, if, uh, let me know how ordering the magazine goes.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.080
I'll order my own copy, uh, if, uh, if it goes well, so let me know.

34:11.120 --> 34:11.680
That's awesome.

34:12.200 --> 34:16.040
Um, Just some quick followups, uh, in chat before I lose them quest

34:16.040 --> 34:19.280
Buster did some research and wanted to mention the transformers game

34:19.280 --> 34:20.000
that we brought up earlier.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.920
That new AR game coming out, uh, quest buster did some research and

34:22.920 --> 34:27.120
found it's an indie studio named very, very spaceship working with Niantic.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.880
Thank you for researching that.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.480
I appreciate you.

34:29.480 --> 34:34.920
That's what I thought, uh, was that it was, uh, not actually developed by Niantic

34:35.200 --> 34:37.360
and pod culture about the poppy.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.240
What's that game called?

34:38.280 --> 34:41.480
Poppy poppy poppy makes you poop.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.840
No, it was Poppy's playhouse.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.240
That's it.

34:45.240 --> 34:45.840
Poppy's playoffs.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.120
Okay.

34:46.200 --> 34:50.720
Cause, uh, I was watching it's it's me Holly last night.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.520
That's that's who, God damn it.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.120
You always follow me on Twitter.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.160
That's who I was watching.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.240
I was looking after she played it and she was talking about it.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.960
It was while she was playing medium.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.120
I'm just dying.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.200
You guys, you guys seriously don't know.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.400
I will be in a channel and finally I'll decide to un-lurk and say, cause like I

35:08.400 --> 35:12.400
usually watch on my Xbox, I have to get on my phone to actually type a message and

35:12.440 --> 35:16.080
I'll say something and then dark soccer goes, Rob, she is all.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.960
I'm like, do you have 10 tabs open with all the channels I watch?

35:19.960 --> 35:20.840
You're always there.

35:20.840 --> 35:27.040
I just like every so often I may have, I may lurk in a few other people's channels,

35:27.040 --> 35:28.560
like, especially if I followed a raid.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.160
Yeah.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.720
But most of the time I pick one person and stay there.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.440
But that's why, yeah, Holly is who I was watching play it as well.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.640
She's very fun and animated and yeah, that game.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.160
So anyway.

35:37.480 --> 35:37.760
Okay.

35:37.760 --> 35:43.960
So about that game, pod culture said next VOG point event, Rob plays this game live

35:44.160 --> 35:47.480
and SSU 100 Matt says, not enough points to get Rob to play that.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.640
Matt is correct.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.200
You want this to happen?

35:50.200 --> 35:52.040
We're going to be talking cash.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.600
We're going to be talking charity event.

35:53.920 --> 35:54.680
What charity?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.240
I don't know.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.960
Um, maybe cats.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.200
Cause that's the thing, especially thinking about what Loki's going through.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.320
And that's the thing we all love.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.200
We all have our cats.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.680
So maybe a cat charity.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.640
Um, but I, I, I'm not going to set an amount yet.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.080
I have to, I have to crunch some numbers and figure out what sounds

36:11.080 --> 36:13.440
realistic, uh, to do something like that.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.080
But, uh, no, you want that.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.360
You have to show the money to the cats, uh, to make that happen.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.080
So we'll see.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.640
It's like a five nights type game.

36:22.680 --> 36:27.400
It's not like it's, it's, it's not necessarily in the style.

36:27.440 --> 36:32.280
I mean, it's five nights as far as like, if there's like animatronic

36:32.280 --> 36:38.600
things that are alive, it's basically, it is a first person like puzzle game.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.320
But there's horror stuff in it as well.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.520
So that's why I kind of compared it to portal a little bit because

36:44.520 --> 36:48.760
you've got these kind of like grabber hands that you put on.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.560
And so you solve puzzles with it.

36:50.560 --> 36:51.760
It's, it's pretty cool.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.520
This looks, but it's also horror.

36:53.680 --> 36:54.880
It's scary as fuck.

36:54.920 --> 36:55.800
It doesn't look scary.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.600
It looks adorable.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.440
It's not necessarily adorable.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.000
You probably want to play it.

37:02.080 --> 37:06.600
That scary stuff is, uh, of course it's only on, um, on a PC.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.920
Um, I think it's a really small studio, maybe like even one

37:10.920 --> 37:11.880
person just putting it together.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.840
So they only have one chapter right now.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.720
That's out, that's like $5.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.760
But in each piece, each episode is gonna be like five bucks as well.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.920
I'm still going to go ahead and buy it now because I might

37:21.920 --> 37:23.600
be able to play this on ARM.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.960
So that'd be cool.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.640
Uh, Mike Deft warns don't have more than three tabs of Twitch opened.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.080
I forgot that that was a thing.

37:31.080 --> 37:31.480
Yeah.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.760
Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, I think it, all your views are

37:35.800 --> 37:37.040
all your views don't count.

37:37.040 --> 37:37.880
Cause it thinks you're a bot.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.720
It thinks you're a view bot.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.800
If you have more than three open.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.440
Well, I, I've got, I don't have any more than that usually.

37:43.720 --> 37:43.920
Yeah.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.920
Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, geez, am I the only one not wanting

37:46.920 --> 37:48.440
to see her friend get traumatized?

37:48.480 --> 37:49.040
Thank you.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.840
But like, Hey, like I said earlier, cats are more important than people.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.480
So I'll get traumatized to try to save a cat.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.040
I'll do it.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.480
Um, so there you go.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.560
All right, Loki, I'm sorry.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.640
We derailed a little bit from your gaming week.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.680
So what else?

38:01.960 --> 38:02.240
Sorry.

38:02.240 --> 38:02.960
Alan came in the room.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.920
Alan, the viewers are talking about Polly.

38:06.280 --> 38:10.200
Playroom Polly's playroom, playtime, poppy playtime.

38:10.240 --> 38:10.760
So, okay.

38:11.040 --> 38:15.760
So they're trying to get me to play Poppy's playtime and with vlog points.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.560
And I'm like, Oh no, no, no.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.040
You want to see this happen.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.120
You got to show money and we're going to do like a cat charity or something

38:22.120 --> 38:25.240
like that if you want Poppy playtime to happen, have you, are you familiar

38:25.240 --> 38:26.680
with Poppy play, Alan walked in the room.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.800
Let me let him make comment.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.080
Have you, have you seen this game?

38:29.080 --> 38:29.680
Alan, what did you think?

38:29.800 --> 38:32.800
I can't, I can't really get on camera the way it's set up right

38:32.800 --> 38:35.400
now, um, episode one is out.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.800
It's a very short demo.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.200
Um, I don't want to give it away.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.000
Basically.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.880
There's just one really intense sequence.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.720
And then if you make it through that, then it's like, congrats.

38:45.720 --> 38:46.600
Wait for episode two.

38:46.600 --> 38:52.920
So, I mean, I would say that you would be better off playing that than

38:52.920 --> 38:55.240
you would a five night at Freddy's TBH.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.920
I mean, it's, it's scary, but it's just, you know, it's a buildup.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.440
And then, you know, the climax.

39:03.200 --> 39:03.600
All right.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.280
Fair enough.

39:04.360 --> 39:04.640
Thank you.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.600
Thank you for popping in.

39:06.160 --> 39:06.800
Hey, Rob.

39:07.200 --> 39:07.440
Yeah.

39:07.440 --> 39:07.720
What?

39:08.360 --> 39:09.840
You're going to want to check your steam and about,

39:13.840 --> 39:18.640
I mean, like, I want to call you names, but then it's like, when you send me gifts,

39:18.640 --> 39:21.920
like it's hard to call you names, but just know the urge is there.

39:24.240 --> 39:24.760
There you go.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.080
And you'll probably like the name I sent it from too.

39:27.200 --> 39:27.760
Great.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.360
All right.

39:28.720 --> 39:29.120
All right.

39:29.120 --> 39:29.600
Loki.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.160
We've derailed.

39:30.160 --> 39:30.960
Congratulations, Rob.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.320
You have a scary game.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.120
We've derailed the cats.

39:34.120 --> 39:34.760
Say thank you.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.880
Uh, Loki, I've derailed your gaming week three times now.

39:37.880 --> 39:38.800
Anything else for your gaming week?

39:39.600 --> 39:40.800
Um, that's it.

39:40.880 --> 39:45.880
I'm probably going to have to dust off my Xbox series X though, for next week,

39:45.920 --> 39:50.080
because you know, we got fours of horizon five coming, so I got to play a little bit

39:50.080 --> 39:55.120
of that at least our pal Bobby Black Wolf was, uh, got to have the look at that game.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.160
Cause he, uh, did the, you know, addition that had the early launch

39:58.160 --> 40:00.720
and, uh, his, uh, reactions on his show were very good.

40:01.080 --> 40:01.800
Very, very good.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.480
Oh, thank you.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.560
Alan just brought into the room and reminded me.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.920
So dark soccer, can you see my cam dark soccer?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.240
Are you, do you have Twitch open?

40:10.120 --> 40:14.520
Um, I usually don't play the thing.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.880
Well, um, for some reason it says I'm not hosting, hold on, give me just a second.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.840
Cause cause Alan came in here, reminded me, we have something for you, dark soccer.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.480
And I, I can't, Alan, can you hold that closer to the cancer?

40:25.480 --> 40:29.480
The name can, that the name is a little, see, it actually says.

40:29.800 --> 40:35.080
Sakura, but in addition to that, Alan decided he wanted to add something extra into it.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.120
Can you put that on cam as well?

40:36.920 --> 40:37.160
Yeah.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.760
Or what, whatever, I thought you bought one for her.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.800
Oh, and Alan says they just opened this store at Arden fair where I found this.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.400
It opened at Arden fair on Saturday.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.080
So this, no, no, no mini, mini.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.520
So mini cell.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.000
Oh, okay.

40:55.640 --> 40:56.440
And it just opened.

40:56.680 --> 40:56.920
Cool.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.000
Wait, are these for Jamie or?

41:01.000 --> 41:01.800
Oh, those are for you.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.120
Oh, okay.

41:02.120 --> 41:02.520
I'm sorry.

41:02.520 --> 41:03.640
These are not for you, Jamie.

41:03.640 --> 41:03.960
Sorry.

41:03.960 --> 41:09.560
He just wants to show them off, but he got a Pokemon face mask with mu.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.240
And I think there's some other Pokemon face masks as well.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.640
Oh, there's an act deaf.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.920
That's an act deaf face mask.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.520
So there you go.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.880
Mike deaf says, oh, we have a mini.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.520
So where I live.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.080
Well, there you go.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.680
You got to go get that Kirby face mask.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.360
Oh, that one's super cute.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.600
Oh, I know the, the, the crime shop.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.080
I've I buy a lot of their masks.

41:33.080 --> 41:37.320
I saw the new, um, was it build a bear, uh, animal crossing figures.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.840
They had them in the storefront when we went by there the other day.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.560
They had a line out the door for something.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.280
I don't know.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.680
Probably those certainly wasn't animal crossing stuff.

41:47.400 --> 41:52.600
I, I just ordered my, um, Tom Nook, uh, holiday ornament.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.280
Love it.

41:55.000 --> 41:55.320
All right.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.920
My gaming week, um, kind of along the same lines as dark soccer.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.360
I had a lot going on this week.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.160
Um, I've been going hog on Pikmin bloom.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.200
Like Pikmin bloom kind of came out at a really good time where I'm trying

42:06.200 --> 42:07.560
to really change my lifestyle.

42:07.560 --> 42:12.600
And you know, of these past couple of years, COVID has taken its toll

42:12.600 --> 42:14.200
in many, many, many ways.

42:14.200 --> 42:19.400
Um, and walking, um, is something I really need to be doing more of.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.680
And I think Pikmin's like this game came out at the right time to

42:22.680 --> 42:24.040
really incentivize some of that.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.480
So I'm level 17 in Pikmin bloom.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.400
I'm not the highest on my friends list though.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.840
Uh, somebody, somebody I'm friends with in Korea is level 20.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.600
I think 21 at this point.

42:34.600 --> 42:39.800
So, um, yeah, but I, I've just been having a good time, uh, walking and

42:39.800 --> 42:42.760
just knowing that I'm leaving a little trail of flowers.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.240
When I, when I opt into it and, uh, sending a little Pikmin on adventures,

42:47.240 --> 42:49.960
you have to get, and for those that are getting into the game,

42:49.960 --> 42:52.200
you unlock things slowly.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.720
And I didn't even know this last week,

42:53.720 --> 42:58.280
but once you get to level 15, you have to get all the way to level 15.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.520
Then you unlock Pikmin Bloom's version of raids where you can go beat up on

43:02.520 --> 43:05.720
mushrooms, which I guess is, um, from the console games.

43:05.720 --> 43:09.960
Uh, and you get little like postcards and, and limited pedal things from that.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.560
So you get like some good stuff from that.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.040
So, um, yeah.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.280
Uh, Pikmin Bloom is super cute and I'm still playing that.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.960
Otherwise kind of the same stuff.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.640
Final Fantasy 14.

43:19.640 --> 43:26.120
Uh, I am, uh, just got my Warrior to 77 and that is my last job to get to 80.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.960
I hit Black Mage 80 in the last week.

43:27.960 --> 43:31.400
So only one more job to get to 80 and then everything will be 80.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.120
Only other thing to really mention for my gaming week, No Man's Sky.

43:34.760 --> 43:38.440
It took me a little bit because the new expedition came out that weekend.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.720
I went to Disneyland, but, um, I'm finally, I was like, okay,

43:41.720 --> 43:44.520
two weeks is enough for them to patch everything that went wrong

43:44.520 --> 43:45.960
with the expedition when it came out.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.440
So I started playing the expedition, like for realsies.

43:48.440 --> 43:52.360
And, uh, I'm up to phase two in the X, I just got to the second,

43:52.360 --> 43:55.080
uh, rendezvous point, uh, in, in there.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.160
So I've still got a few more phases to go.

43:57.160 --> 44:01.480
It's all about worms, sandworms that, that fly out of the planet.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.160
And it didn't hit me.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.280
Okay, tremors.

44:04.280 --> 44:10.760
Well, no, what it is, it's not officially a tie-in, but you know, it's timed because of Dune.

44:10.760 --> 44:13.320
It's a tie-in to the Dune movie, although not officially.

44:13.320 --> 44:16.760
So they did the sandworm expedition right when the Dune movie released.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.560
So, um, not tremors, but close.

44:19.560 --> 44:23.240
So, uh, I, I think anyway, obviously they're not going to confirm or deny that,

44:23.240 --> 44:25.560
but it is a very interesting coincidence for sure.

44:25.560 --> 44:28.520
So, um, that is, that is what's going on in No Man's Sky.

44:29.080 --> 44:29.560
All right.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.480
Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.600
I don't have any show schedule updates to really get out there.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.800
Uh, as far as I know, we're not having any shows off in the future.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.760
So let's move on.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.280
We still need to schedule.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.880
You guys did meet the point reward for Orange Lounge Fudio.

44:43.880 --> 44:46.520
I just need to pin down a date with my co-host for that to happen.

44:46.520 --> 44:47.480
So we'll work on that.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.000
It will be sometime this month, just in time for Thanksgiving.

44:51.000 --> 44:51.800
All right.

44:51.800 --> 44:57.400
In the meantime, let's get into some, uh, gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight

44:57.400 --> 45:02.440
with, uh, kind of the company that has been a reoccurring headline in the last few months.

45:03.000 --> 45:03.320
Yeah.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.680
So Activision Blizzard.

45:04.680 --> 45:10.840
So the announcement that Jen O'Neill, who was one of the, uh, I'm not exactly sure what

45:10.840 --> 45:12.200
position she had.

45:12.200 --> 45:16.440
She was, um, I guess one of the top positions in Blizzard.

45:16.440 --> 45:20.360
And that was kind of a big deal because, you know, female in a top position at a company

45:20.360 --> 45:26.360
that's has, uh, see allegedly very misogynistic, uh, tendencies.

45:26.360 --> 45:30.760
Uh, she is stepping down, uh, immediately, or at least I used to say at the end of the

45:30.760 --> 45:36.920
year, she will be stepping down and Mike Ybarra is going to be taking over, um, those

45:36.920 --> 45:37.800
duties as well.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.320
And, you know, basically, of course, a dude.

45:41.320 --> 45:41.640
Yeah.

45:41.640 --> 45:46.200
According to the ABK Alliance, you know, they said, this is a sad moment for many of us

45:46.200 --> 45:50.920
at ABK who are very excited to have a new experience, uh, with women of color heading

45:50.920 --> 45:51.720
our company.

45:51.720 --> 45:57.480
We found out during our shareholder meeting and wish Jen well in her future endeavors.

45:57.480 --> 46:00.200
Um, along with that as well.

46:00.200 --> 46:04.600
And I'm not sure if this is related to the drama, but, uh, apparently Overwatch two and

46:04.600 --> 46:07.480
Diablo four have been delayed to 2023.

46:07.480 --> 46:13.640
They're still, uh, planning to deliver substantial amounts of content, uh, from Blizzard next

46:13.640 --> 46:18.120
year, but, uh, now playing later launches for those two games.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.360
Define substantial.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.480
I'm going to guess the Diablo mobile game, I think is finally going to line.

46:23.480 --> 46:27.400
I think they've said it's going to launch early 2022, but beyond that question mark,

46:28.040 --> 46:30.120
um, I don't know.

46:30.120 --> 46:35.320
And maybe a Hearthstone expansion or something, but it's, it's, I don't think substantial

46:35.320 --> 46:37.320
is an interesting word for them to use now.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.480
And this chance we're going to get so many candy crush updates.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.480
This plays into what I said last week.

46:43.480 --> 46:47.160
I know you weren't here, Loki, but, um, you certainly heard about the virtual Blizzcon

46:47.160 --> 46:48.920
getting canceled early next year.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.320
And I said there, what do they have to show?

46:51.960 --> 46:55.080
They have games that they shown already.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.360
And if they want to give an update on Overwatch two, they'll just drop a trailer out of nowhere

46:58.360 --> 46:58.920
on us.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.720
You know what I mean?

46:59.720 --> 47:04.760
And so I, I, and now, now of course, a week later, we hear the games get delayed another,

47:04.760 --> 47:07.000
you know, which again, okay.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.120
I'm, I'm of two minds.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
And I said this last week and I'm sorry to repeat myself.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.640
I'm of two minds of this.

47:11.640 --> 47:12.200
Yes.

47:12.200 --> 47:16.200
I understand the great Miyamoto and I agree with this and I understand the great quote

47:16.200 --> 47:18.680
that we always say everybody always fucking says with delays.

47:19.480 --> 47:19.980
Yes.

47:20.280 --> 47:23.400
A good game is always good, but a bad game is forever bad.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.800
And no one will remember that you delayed a game, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47:25.800 --> 47:26.520
We all know that.

47:26.520 --> 47:26.840
Yes.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.800
I do agree with that.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.080
However, guess what?

47:29.080 --> 47:30.680
No game makes no money.

47:31.640 --> 47:37.240
And Blizzard is in, is really in a circumstance here, especially with wow, losing the players

47:37.240 --> 47:38.280
that they've been losing.

47:38.280 --> 47:42.760
Like, wow has, or Blizzard has got to figure out how to get these games out faster.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.840
They really do.

47:44.840 --> 47:50.040
I, I, and I, I don't understand how like a new call of duty game will be all hands on

47:50.040 --> 47:53.640
fucking deck around Activision, but Overwatch won't.

47:54.280 --> 47:56.520
And yes, before somebody in chat, corrects me.

47:56.520 --> 47:56.760
Yes.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.920
Call of duty sells buku millions billions.

47:59.480 --> 47:59.720
Yes.

47:59.720 --> 48:03.320
That is the very clear reason why it is all hands on deck for a call of duty game.

48:03.320 --> 48:07.320
Why can't it be some hands on deck for Overwatch though?

48:07.320 --> 48:11.480
You know, to try to, and look, I get there's a certain level of quality we expect.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.040
Yes.

48:12.040 --> 48:20.280
That can all be true with the right oversight of the game, but like Blizzard has got to

48:20.280 --> 48:20.840
step on it.

48:21.480 --> 48:27.080
And all these, all these people, like the Overwatch guy leaving the Diablo guy leaving

48:27.080 --> 48:29.720
Jen O'Neill now leaving isn't helping.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.120
It's not helping the speed situation.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.840
Like Blizzard needs new leadership.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.840
Mikey Barra.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.640
Okay, cool.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.720
Like he did a lot of good stuff with Microsoft.

48:39.720 --> 48:40.760
Let's see what he's got.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.200
I'm not going to discount him.

48:42.200 --> 48:46.440
Let's see if he, you know, has it in him to fix what's going on with Blizzard.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.240
You know, but I also kind of think he can't do it alone.

48:49.240 --> 48:51.720
I don't necessarily mean he needs a co-chair.

48:51.720 --> 48:56.760
I thought it was nice, but he probably doesn't need one, but, um, he's going to need support

48:56.760 --> 48:58.840
all the way from the top at Activision for sure.

48:59.880 --> 49:04.440
Anyway, um, Mike Defton chat says the thing here, Rob, with all the people that left over

49:04.440 --> 49:08.600
the past six months, how can they work on a game without any sort of leadership or management?

49:08.600 --> 49:15.320
And honestly, it is somebody has got to come in and clean up the rodeo and get it going

49:15.320 --> 49:15.720
fast.

49:16.840 --> 49:22.280
I Mikey Barra has a big job ahead of a big Jen O'Neill did too, but she found an option

49:22.280 --> 49:25.640
that worked better for her at the same time for her professional growth.

49:25.640 --> 49:26.280
Good for her.

49:27.560 --> 49:32.200
Is anyone going to fault her for leaving Blizzard to, what does it start her own charity or

49:32.200 --> 49:36.520
work on this board of this charity or whatever it is that supports the wider picture of supporting

49:36.520 --> 49:37.240
women in gaming?

49:37.240 --> 49:38.280
Am I getting that all correct?

49:38.680 --> 49:43.560
Is her reasons for leaving who's going to fault her for that, but somebody's still got

49:43.560 --> 49:44.760
to come in and clean up the mess.

49:48.840 --> 49:49.320
I don't know.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.760
It's, it's, it's just sad.

49:50.760 --> 49:59.640
I do feel like the big card, the T card that Blizzard might have in their pocket for 2022.

50:00.360 --> 50:05.080
And I, I, I'm going to say it now is this, I think absolutely this has to happen whether

50:05.080 --> 50:05.960
it's a mess or not.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.400
They're going to drop wrath of the Lich King classic.

50:09.400 --> 50:09.720
Wow.

50:10.600 --> 50:11.480
Absolutely.

50:11.480 --> 50:14.680
Because that was the peak of world of Warcraft.

50:15.400 --> 50:19.720
And I do feel like there are people that will go, go back to world of Warcraft specifically

50:19.720 --> 50:21.000
for that expansion.

50:21.800 --> 50:26.520
I don't think it'll be nearly as many as played while in the Heyday, but that's, that's the

50:26.520 --> 50:31.880
T card that Blizzard has in their back pocket that I do think they will drop in 2022 when

50:31.880 --> 50:33.560
that probably wasn't in their original plan.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.360
Anyway, yeah.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.440
S2-100 Matt says lost Vikings.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.040
Ooh, a new lost Vikings project.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.080
Wouldn't that be fabulous?

50:42.440 --> 50:43.480
I think that would be great.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.360
It'd be nice, but would it happen?

50:47.000 --> 50:47.800
Probably not.

50:47.800 --> 50:53.240
It is a little niche at this point, unless, you know, Blizzard, whoever can put a really

50:53.240 --> 50:54.680
shiny coat of paint on it.

50:54.680 --> 50:59.480
The other card that Blizzard has in their back pocket, Vicarious Visions.

51:00.120 --> 51:02.360
They did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.

51:02.360 --> 51:08.360
Honestly, the, the only problem with the Diablo 2 remaster is that it was, it was, it was

51:08.360 --> 51:09.400
Diablo 2.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.400
It was, that's not a bad, hold on before you put your pitchworks and torches down.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.080
Diablo 2 is a great game.

51:15.080 --> 51:19.320
It is a monumental game in gaming history, but it's an old game and there's a lot of

51:19.320 --> 51:22.760
quality of life things that have changed a lot in the industry and with those types of

51:22.760 --> 51:23.800
games since then.

51:23.800 --> 51:27.880
And it's a little hard sometimes to go back to that old way with Diablo 2.

51:28.760 --> 51:32.840
Otherwise, Vicarious Visions did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.

51:32.840 --> 51:39.640
So the big question mark, what is Vicarious Visions working on now?

51:41.640 --> 51:42.760
Is it another remaster?

51:42.760 --> 51:46.760
And that was the studio that Jen O'Neill had, that was her studio.

51:46.760 --> 51:47.960
That's where she was pulled from.

51:48.520 --> 51:51.640
What is the game that they are working on?

51:52.440 --> 51:55.480
And if anybody's doing a Lost Vikings remake justice,

51:58.520 --> 52:00.760
them, but we'll see.

52:00.760 --> 52:05.240
But I think that is the big question that we have to figure out to see if there really

52:05.240 --> 52:08.280
are monumental Blizzard releases coming this year.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.520
What is Vicarious Visions working on?

52:10.520 --> 52:12.360
That is the $50,000 question.

52:13.960 --> 52:14.520
Moving on.

52:15.640 --> 52:19.480
Let's talk about another studio that's having a lot of problems, um, internally.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.360
And it's one that, admittedly, we probably haven't shown the spotlight on enough.

52:24.360 --> 52:30.200
Because, you know, just looking at the games that we tend to talk about here on OLR, we

52:30.200 --> 52:34.040
collectively, as the hosts, have probably spent more time playing the World of Warcraft,

52:34.040 --> 52:39.400
the Overwatches, the Diablos than we have the Far Cry's, the Assassin's Creed.

52:39.400 --> 52:42.520
Not to say we don't play those games, just not as many hours spent on them.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.160
I used to play Far Cry, just not, you know.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.080
But did you hear what I said?

52:47.080 --> 52:48.680
Not as many hours, right?

52:48.680 --> 52:50.120
Collectively, between the three of us.

52:50.120 --> 52:54.440
So we don't often shine the light on Ubisoft.

52:55.080 --> 53:01.080
Well, how about, I think one a lot of people, the Super Mario Rayman Rabbids, the tech game

53:01.080 --> 53:02.840
that that was, I can't, why can't I remember the name?

53:02.840 --> 53:05.880
Mario vs. Rabbids, Mario Rabbids, that whole thing.

53:05.880 --> 53:06.680
That's Ubisoft.

53:06.680 --> 53:12.680
Anyway, the point is, I've been sitting here on the show going, it has been X number of

53:12.680 --> 53:15.480
days since the ABK letter's been responded to.

53:15.480 --> 53:21.800
What I have failed to highlight, and I'm sorry, is that the Ubisoft letter has also gone unresponded

53:21.800 --> 53:26.280
to, and as of the taping of tonight's show, still has.

53:26.280 --> 53:33.000
In fact, it has been 100 days as of November 5th, so today would be day 102.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.360
At Twitter account, A Better Ubisoft, very familiar to what we saw with A Better ABK,

53:38.360 --> 53:43.800
A Better Ubisoft tweeted, 100 days ago, we signed our open letter and set our four key

53:43.800 --> 53:44.680
demands.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.600
None of our demands have been met.

53:46.600 --> 53:52.520
So today, we're launching a new petition open for all of our supporters to sign, and it

53:52.520 --> 53:58.200
is basically targeted right at Yves Guillemin in another tweet saying, you disappoint us.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.400
100 days, zero demands met.

54:01.400 --> 54:03.080
Surely you can do better than this.

54:04.440 --> 54:10.680
Interesting, the phrasing is right out of those Far Cry 6 emails that were sent to all

54:10.680 --> 54:13.800
the people that were playing that game and then kind of like abandoned it for a few days.

54:13.800 --> 54:17.240
They got those emails out of the blue that were like, you disappoint me, you, but it's

54:17.240 --> 54:18.600
like from the villain in the game.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.160
Oh, clever, clever, clever.

54:21.160 --> 54:24.120
They really like spamming you if you don't play their stupid game.

54:24.120 --> 54:27.160
Oh yeah, this is a whole big thing because it led into a discussion about how the games

54:27.160 --> 54:32.600
track your play and all this, but you, you, when you click the agreed all those terms

54:32.600 --> 54:36.120
and conditions for you play or whatever it's called, guess what?

54:36.120 --> 54:37.400
You told them they could email you.

54:38.280 --> 54:40.600
So that's why people are getting emails.

54:41.320 --> 54:44.760
Yeah, but don't, there's also other ways of getting the emails blocked.

54:45.720 --> 54:50.040
Oh yeah, oh yeah, if I got one of those emails, I just report a spam, done.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.720
The Gmail filters are pretty good on that as are most email systems.

54:55.160 --> 54:58.840
As a reminder, the four, a better Ubisoft key demands.

54:58.840 --> 55:02.760
Number one, stop promoting and moving note offenders from studio to studio.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.360
Team to team with no repercussions.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.480
The cycle needs to end.

55:05.480 --> 55:10.360
Number two, we want a collective seat at the table to have a meaningful say in how Ubisoft

55:10.360 --> 55:12.200
as a company moves forward from here.

55:12.200 --> 55:18.280
Number three, cross industry collaboration to agree on a set of ground rules and processes

55:18.280 --> 55:21.880
that all studios can use to handle these offenses in the future.

55:21.880 --> 55:27.000
Number four, this collaboration must heavily involve employees in non-management positions

55:27.000 --> 55:29.080
and union representatives.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.280
What here is so fucking crazy?

55:32.280 --> 55:38.520
They're like, honestly, these are, these are really, this bar is very low.

55:39.320 --> 55:39.560
Yeah.

55:40.200 --> 55:43.880
In my opinion, number five, in my opinion, underlined bolded,

55:43.880 --> 55:47.240
number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.080
Yeah, but absolutely.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.280
They're not going to go there.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.960
Certainly the employees aren't going to go there.

55:53.960 --> 55:54.920
I will go there.

55:54.920 --> 55:57.720
Number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.

55:57.720 --> 56:00.760
Why not give Jay Allard a call?

56:00.760 --> 56:01.800
Why don't you see how he's doing?

56:03.160 --> 56:05.400
Run a company like shit, get a shitty result.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.020
Totally.

56:09.960 --> 56:14.520
The petition is quite simply, I support, it's a Google doc.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.720
So that's why it's a little tricky.

56:15.720 --> 56:19.160
I can't just give you the URL, but I can give you the link to the Twitter account,

56:19.160 --> 56:20.120
A Better Ubisoft.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.040
100 days since our open letter and none of our demands have been met.

56:24.040 --> 56:27.560
This new petition is open to everyone who supports a better Ubisoft campaign.

56:27.560 --> 56:32.040
Please add your name, show your support of at A Better Ubisoft on Twitter and share this link.

56:32.120 --> 56:35.160
I will fill this out on the show right now

56:35.880 --> 56:41.000
and say from all of us at the world's longest running video game podcast, Orange Lounge Radio.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.520
But of course we should all sign individually as well,

56:44.520 --> 56:48.520
but I'm going to go ahead and sign it from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio

56:48.520 --> 56:52.360
and our thoughts to those employees at Ubisoft,

56:52.360 --> 56:56.360
who I don't think are asking for anything unrealistic by having a seat at the table.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.800
SHJ 100 Matt in chat says,

57:00.760 --> 57:02.600
why does Yves Guillemin still have a job?

57:02.600 --> 57:03.480
It's baffling to me.

57:03.480 --> 57:04.200
He's still there.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.560
It all happened on his watch.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.240
Everyone else got let go except him.

57:07.240 --> 57:10.520
I understand he's the co-founder CEO, but why isn't the board pressing anything?

57:11.320 --> 57:11.880
Because men.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.280
I don't, I do not have an answer outside of what Dark Soccer just said.

57:19.400 --> 57:20.600
There is no answer.

57:20.600 --> 57:21.640
There is no spoon.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.720
There is no, there is nothing.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.040
It doesn't make sense.

57:28.040 --> 57:28.540
Resign.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.280
Bitch.

57:30.280 --> 57:30.680
All right.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.360
Because he's got a dick.

57:33.960 --> 57:34.920
I mean, I'm sorry.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.240
It's, and I'm not, okay.

57:37.240 --> 57:39.880
For anyone who thinks, I'm laughing at Twitch, not you, sorry.

57:40.520 --> 57:44.120
For anyone who thinks that calling something out like that is misandry,

57:44.120 --> 57:49.800
you can, first of all, take your tiny little brain, vomit it, and then shove it back up your ass.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.120
Number two, this is the way that the world is.

57:54.120 --> 57:54.920
I am not wrong.

57:57.320 --> 57:57.800
Just saying.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.520
The comment that made me laugh on Twitch,

58:01.400 --> 58:06.440
SSG100Matt says, sign up from that Catholic school that tagged OLR in that random tweet.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.080
We get tagged.

58:07.080 --> 58:09.480
Go check out OLR's Twitter.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.480
We get tagged in the, okay, look, we're very lucky.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.840
We've been on Twitter so fucking long.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.360
The show's existed so fucking long.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.280
We have a three letter Twitter name.

58:16.280 --> 58:18.760
You actually can't get those anymore.

58:18.760 --> 58:21.800
My old Twitter name used to be Skye, S-K-I-E.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.560
You, I can't get it back.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.600
Even if I wanted to.

58:24.600 --> 58:28.920
I don't because I now, I don't really go by Skye online anymore.

58:28.920 --> 58:33.320
My brand quote unquote is Rob Roberts or on Twitter because the spammer got it.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.440
Mr. Rob Roberts.

58:34.440 --> 58:35.640
So follow, plug plug.

58:37.640 --> 58:43.880
But you can't get a Twitter name with less than four characters at this point anymore.

58:43.880 --> 58:47.240
So the fact that we're sitting on OLR, number one, is a gold mine anyway.

58:47.240 --> 58:52.040
But number two, we get like, there's all sorts of, I guess there's some fucking school out there

58:52.040 --> 58:56.200
that's OLR because we were getting tagged in like bullshit referee.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.600
Just go look at twitter.com slash OLR.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.080
It's weird.

58:59.080 --> 59:02.840
And I actually, I replied to it and I quote tweeted it and I said, ma'am, this is a podcast.

59:05.080 --> 59:07.160
I thought it was funny anyway.

59:07.880 --> 59:08.380
All right.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.640
Oh, did they say they took it down?

59:11.640 --> 59:12.440
Really?

59:12.440 --> 59:12.920
Hold on.

59:12.920 --> 59:13.080
Yeah.

59:13.080 --> 59:14.120
I was deleted.

59:14.120 --> 59:16.440
They deleted the tweet after I quote tweeted.

59:17.000 --> 59:17.480
Victory.

59:17.480 --> 59:47.480
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh du

59:47.480 --> 01:00:17.480
duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:23.640
There was an OMGITSROB2, but there wasn't just an OMGITSROB, and I was like, I'll take it, yoink.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.440
Somebody-

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.400
Maybe then that means that there was one and it was deleted.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.200
Probably.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.240
After that one was made.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.280
I wish the Rob Roberts account would get deleted so I could get it, but unfortunately, there's me,

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:41.880
there's apparently some politician in the UK who kind of sounds like an ass,

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:48.120
there's some DJ in Australia, New Zealand, and there is some rugby player.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.640
All of us named Rob Roberts.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.720
So it will be a fight to who gets that name first once the spammer disappears.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.640
Fingers crossed.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.400
It should be me, damn it.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.520
I've been on Twitter the longest.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.880
All right.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.520
Anyway, moving on.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.160
I'm sorry, we derailed a long way from a very serious topic, but I do want to re-emphasize,

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.560
speaking of Twitter, check out what's going on with a better Ubisoft and latest updates

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.480
and resign iskimam.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.040
Let's move on.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.800
Let's try to get some happy news, Dark Sakura.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.440
So a game called Tetris the Grandmaster is getting a home port.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.680
And then they said it was going to be delayed.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:37.240
So they announced the port by announcing that the announcement has been delayed.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.040
Does that make sense?

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.240
Yes, this game is coming out eventually.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:50.120
This is the same arcade version from 1998, which was considered one of the best ones

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.960
and is often used for speed runs and competition.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.640
And of course, there were other sequels like Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.600
and Tetris, the Grandmaster three terror instinct.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.240
What's terror about Tetris, please?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.740
Thank you.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:13.340
Um, but this tweet is actually, hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read it.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:13.840
Okay.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:20.300
The announcement about the TGM series for home use, which was scheduled for today, has

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.740
not been released yet due to the reasons other than Arika.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.180
I guess that's the company.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:25.820
Yes, company.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:33.020
In addition, although it is a new TGM work that is under consideration separately, there

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:39.100
is a request from the licenser side that I want you to make the case success as a condition.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.460
So it is very legitimate.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.660
It's, it's bad translation.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.660
But basically it means this is, this is real.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.460
It is a real game, but we're not supposed to announce it yet.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.400
Wild.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.740
I think they just worked around being told not to announce it.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.120
Interesting.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.580
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I don't know if he'll be at games on quick, but talking to

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.700
our old friend, Kevin.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.200
Yes.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.900
One of our listeners who used to go by Kevin DDR.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.180
I don't think he goes by that anymore.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:10.540
I think he changed his branding, but, um, he is very well known for doing Tetris at

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.340
games done quick.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.340
He listened to this show back in the day.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.860
I don't know if he still does, but hello, if you're listening, um, and has done some

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.300
very impressive tech, like he did Tetris blindfolded this game.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.580
If I remember right.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.820
Well, no, that can't be possible because you have to know what he did.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.980
There was something wild he did with this game.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.620
I remember somebody in chat remind me what it was.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.420
Um, but anyway, the full comment, Dr.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.100
Tetsuya said is that from talking to our old friend, he's thinking this is a compilation

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.620
of the three, uh, TGM arcade games.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.820
So it might be like a compilation.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:42.860
That'd be really cool.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.380
Uh, and you know, the switch has been getting a lot of like arcade ports.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.380
You know, we talked about it again last week.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.380
Um, the whole series of the.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.060
Oh my God, what?

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.900
Arcade archives and you know, the console archives and that whole news arcade archives.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.060
There's been a lot of arcade ports on switch.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.860
Not that this is falling into that same, um, branding, but it is, you know, very interesting.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:03.420
Uh, and Dr.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.860
Tetsuya says he made grand master, which is not an easy feat at all.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.260
So that's really cool.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.380
Well, congratulations.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.780
Um, I I'm I'll check this game out.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:19.340
Oh, the other thing, um, that is like a neat, uh, apparently Tetris 99 is by that Akira

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.260
company, although they kind of did it in a partnership.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.780
Arika did this in partnership with, uh, Nintendo, the Tetris 99.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.580
So a lot of people have already played that style of Tetris.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.340
But I think, I think it's neat that there's room for all of this Tetris,

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.260
because you can look at Tetris 99.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:39.180
You can look at Tetris effect and you can look at Tetris, the grand master and go,

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.860
these are all great Tetris games.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.700
And then you can look at what gelico did on the PlayStation with that Tetris release and

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.380
go, that is a shit Tetris game.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.340
But anyway, I digress.

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.140
I don't know if he ever played Tetris on PlayStation.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.260
It was horrible.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:52.960
All right.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.260
I play one Tetris.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:55.580
Sorry.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.060
Two Tetris is two, two only to Tetra.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.020
Tetris sees.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.500
I don't know what the, the plural would be.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.220
What are the two?

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.980
It's the nest one and the game boy win.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.220
Yep.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.420
Those, those are good ones.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.700
Uh, Tetranet.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:12.380
Yeah.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.500
Tetranet was great.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.700
I miss Tetranet.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.260
Yeah.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.100
It was a little throwback to Tetranet.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.180
I don't know how much of that exists.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.940
We need a Tetranet stream.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.420
Oh my God.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.620
Is Tetranet still a thing?

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.260
I have no idea.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:25.760
Okay.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.140
Maybe I I'm going to put my foot in my mouth, but I'm saying it anyway.

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.640
Next.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.660
O L R or I'm sorry.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:36.540
Next vog point redeem thing.

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.420
Tetranet night.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.220
I'm so in for that.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:40.780
Dark soccer.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.980
Would you do a Tetranet night?

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.420
If I can get it to run on this for sure.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.460
If we can play it.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.180
Sure.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:47.500
All right.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:48.860
All right.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.420
Moving on.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.260
Uh, let's go onto our next story.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:51.760
Loki.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:53.180
Yeah.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:06:00.460
So apparently there was some game that's being developed by, uh, the folks behind,

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.180
uh, the mafia three series.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:11.660
And so hanger 13 was working on this ambitious, I guess, new IP for take two.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:15.340
And fortunately it's been canceled.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:21.980
So hanger 13's latest project, um, when they pursue new intellectual properties,

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:25.580
we occasionally may encounter situations that call for cancellation.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.020
We encourage our teams to pursue their passions and take creative risks,

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.700
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.980
Um, they didn't do it.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.820
So, uh, not sure what it was going to be.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:41.020
The game went by a code name volt or Voltron.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:46.940
So, um, maybe something similar to like Anthem, something like that.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.940
Maybe we can speculate all day, but I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:58.300
We'll just wait a good five, 10 years or so when somehow a working build of this game

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.620
leaks out into the public, you know, and we'll figure it out then.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.620
Kitty.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.540
It's a midnight.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:11.660
Oh, I have grabbed her against her will.

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.140
What do you have to say about that boo?

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.740
Smoosh never comes in here during the show.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.180
I guess he just yells at you from across the house.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:21.660
He did.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:26.140
When we were all in person, he would, because he was like, oh, new people.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.500
Oh, anti Jamie, you know, he would do, he would do those types of things.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:29.900
Yeah.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.460
So, but now it's just like, oh, I see that guy all the time.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.900
I'm not going to go over there.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:39.100
So anyway, we have a cat in the neighborhood named blue.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.180
She is a gray short-haired cat.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.660
She now knows that I work from home.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.260
And if we leave the door, the front door, we have a screen door in the front door.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:55.260
Or if I leave the side door open in the kitchen here, she will come up and meow at the door

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.260
for me to come outside to pet her belly.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:03.180
Oh, and today she tried to run into the house when I was going back inside.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.780
I'm like, nope, you can't go in there.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.740
Congratulations.

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.620
You have another cat.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.020
I know.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.140
I don't know whose cat it is.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.780
It's one of the, so one of the neighbor's cats.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.140
She always smells like, uh, like laundry.

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.820
She always smells like laundry sheets.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:23.660
And I'm not sure if that's like, uh, there are worse things a cat can smell like.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.900
No, I bet she's cuddling up against a dryer because it's warm.

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.500
I think that might be a serious answer.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.100
Maybe.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.780
I don't know, but she's one of the neighbor's cats.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.220
Knock it off.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:40.140
Um, I, I found a kitty friend when I was doing, um, a walk recently during Pikmin at the park

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.900
and I was afraid I was going to make the Loki mistake.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.420
I was petting the kitty and it's adorable, but no collar.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.140
I couldn't see that the ear was chipped or anything like that.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:52.060
And I'm like, oh God, this is probably a neighborhood cat, but like very friendly to

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.460
humans.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.620
Most ferrules kind of hiss at the humans.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.660
They don't really come up to a real feral.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.300
We'll do that.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.700
Um, a lot of people though, there's a lot of assholes out there, especially now in this

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.420
period that have adopted COVID pets and abandoned them.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.260
And you know what those people are?

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:10.700
They're shit.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.220
Anyway, we digressed.

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.140
It's always back to cats, but that's why, but we digress from the big budget game that

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:18.700
got canceled.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.700
So this is a $53 million project.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.500
Take two canceled.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.300
Yeah, that is.

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.400
Wow.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:30.060
You know, I, you know what I'm reminded of funny enough, blizzard, blizzard cancel.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.060
And I can't remember the name of the game.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.220
Now somebody in chat might remember it was a pro.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.740
Well, they never announced the game.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.420
It was always project.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.060
It was project Atlas.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:45.180
I don't, I don't remember the name of it, but it was like, it was a huge thing that they

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.220
were undertaking.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:53.900
Well, the point is Overwatch was born of that because it was supposed to be, I guess I,

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:58.220
they never really said what it was all about, but it was some type of like MMO type of thing

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.580
where like you would go into these combat areas and the combats were Overwatch.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.540
And so what they did, they built that out into its own game.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.860
And a lot of the characters in the original Overwatch were supposed to be for that.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.100
Thank you, tiger client is Titan was the name of it.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.980
It was project Titan.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.300
Ah, yeah, that is it Titan.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.620
And a lot of those characters that were, especially in the original Overwatch were from that project

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:21.500
Titan game.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.220
So my point is because I'm sitting here going, well, that's $53 million down the fucking

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:26.940
drain, right?

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.540
You gotta be pissed off if you're a shareholder or you're somebody that's, you know, on the

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:35.660
board of this company, but maybe there's a way they can reuse some of what they built

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.540
in something else.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.020
It just depends on what it is, which of course we don't know.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.220
There's rumors yet.

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:40.460
No.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.980
What are they going to work on?

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.100
Oh, I'm sure something else is lined up.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.060
Grand Theft Auto six.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.660
We need people to help.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.860
Oh, well, Grand Theft Auto remaster, uh, Chinatown wars remaster.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.300
What, what haven't they remastered yet?

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:56.620
Loki.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.500
That's what they're going to work on.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:05.100
So anyway, every master bully, everybody wants a bully remaster or a bully sequel.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:12.940
That's not a terrible idea, but who knows?

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.060
I guess anything's possible, but they're, they'll probably play a coaster test.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.300
It'll probably be like the Titan thing where we won't really figure it out until a couple

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:26.140
years later when either the derivative game comes out or a former employee eventually

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:31.500
squeals because they figure the, um, uh, the NDA doesn't apply to them anymore, even

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.260
though it technically does.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.980
But, you know, people will squeal eventually.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.260
It just might be a few years.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.980
So, all right, moving on.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.980
You got to love this headline.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.300
Bowser pleads guilty.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.260
Uh, and, uh, that's exactly what's going on.

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.460
Is that time?

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:48.700
Yep.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.020
That's right.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.460
They caught him.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.460
They, they got him gals.

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:52.860
All right.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:59.020
You've been arrested for 83 chart or you're being charged with 83 counts of kidnapping,

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:05.740
false imprisonment, setting fire in places where it shouldn't be.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.940
All right, look, uh, I am not talking about Bowser, the villain and Mario.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.540
I am not talking about Doug Bowser.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:20.220
I am talking about Gary Bowser, who was in the news, uh, previously as part of team executor.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.300
Doesn't that sound like a very Bowser sounding name?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.020
It was a hack.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.620
I have purchased so many of their products and I'm very disappointed.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.780
That was selling software and heart.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:33.660
I don't think you should admit that Logie, uh, software allegedly, it was research purposes.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.220
It was, uh, research.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:42.620
Well, I don't have it anymore because, or maybe I don't remember, but, um, it was, I

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:48.140
had a, a chipped, um, we, to be able to, um, mod stuff with that.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.820
And then, um, never could mod anything with it too.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.060
And then eventually they had like easier things you don't even need.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.620
I was going to say, I didn't have a chip.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.060
Uh, the Xbox 360 also, they did a lot of, um, repair kits.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:06.220
I had gone through a lot of their repair kits for the rhetoric at death type stuff.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.980
So that was another thing that I perused them from.

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.420
Or, and I think an actual, like, uh, I don't know.

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.940
I bought lots of things.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:20.380
Well, anyway, team X executor, uh, believed that they were advocating for homebrew programs

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:26.220
and a consumer's right to repair their own property, which in that regard points are

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:26.780
made.

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:31.500
Um, however, the Japanese, uh, company Nintendo teamed up with the U S government.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.620
And, uh, so you got many nations involved in, uh, uh, bringing charges against Gary

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.860
Bowser and team, uh, executor.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:45.740
And, um, the court documents called them a criminal criminal enterprise that was over

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.460
a dozen individual members located around the world.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:53.340
And, uh, eventually they, uh, pleaded guilty.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:14:00.700
So you have 48 year old French national max Lauren and 51, uh, Canadian man, Gary Bowser,

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.780
who were arrested and, uh, Bowser was in the Dominican Republic.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:09.580
So surely you're following all the rules when you've fled to another country that, you know,

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:14.380
is much smaller, but anyway, uh, he's been extradited to the United States and that's

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.100
where he's been.

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:21.260
And yeah, I'm glad we're going after these large criminals that clearly caused Nintendo

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.260
so much loss in money.

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:28.700
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to circumvent technological measures and trafficking and

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.900
circumvention devices, which both carry maximum prison sentences of five years.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.340
Although I would imagine if he pled guilty, he will not get that maximum sentence.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.500
He's probably hoping for something like probation.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.540
So we will see.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:47.340
Um, let's see the FBI Raymond Duda of the FBI was quoted saying, imagine if something

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.940
you invented was stolen from you and then marketed and sold to customers around the

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:51.420
world.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.820
That's exactly exactly what team ex executor was doing.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:59.980
This is a perfect example of why the FBI has made the prevention of theft and intellectual

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.580
property a priority.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.300
These arrests should send a message to would be pirates that the FBI does not consider

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.660
these crimes to be a game.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.660
I feel like that should be said.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.860
That's the FBI logo on a splash screen.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:13.260
Thank you.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:13.660
Thank you.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:19.340
Boomers for like, uh, that, that wonderful, you know, no, no, it wasn't, his name wasn't

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:19.740
boomer.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.900
It was Duda, I think, or I closed the window already.

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.660
Um, it's just, it's so stupid though.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:30.140
Like seriously, like I get it like, yeah, mod chips and stuff, but like you could go

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.460
back to like even like PlayStation and stuff like that.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:32.700
Yeah.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.780
There's their mod chips that they had out there that you could hire a game and run it

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.020
on there, but you can also use it to play stuff from other regions.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.940
Or although I think that, you know, honestly though, I think the systems are region free

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.180
for at least like some of the more modern systems, but there are other applications

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.780
playing modded games.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.460
For example, I did a lot of modded grand theft auto.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:01.980
I didn't necessarily have, um, executed products when it came to running that stuff.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:07.420
That was just, you know, hard drive or a district flashes, but you know, we played a lot of

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.620
modded stuff with it and no harm to other people.

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:17.100
Cause I owned like, you know, my copy of grand theft auto four at the time, but I don't

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:17.260
know.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.820
I think it's stupid to go after these mod chip creators.

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.820
It's not like it's destroying this console.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:28.940
I think it's a whole different situation now than like, say it was a long time ago.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.220
So I think now it's just really easy and convenient to buy games.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.140
Yep.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:34.620
I don't know.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:36.460
All right.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:42.700
Or I mean, or let's put it this way now, like they're almost out of the market anyways,

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.780
because it probably even easier to emulate some of these systems before it is to, you

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.820
know, like we talked about like the switch emulation and stuff like that.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.940
It's like, well, Oh, darn, I can't, you know, I can't mod my switch now.

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.020
I guess I'll just have to emulate it on PC instead and get around all of those problems.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.180
All right.

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:01.660
Stupid.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.100
Let's move on.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.020
Like they're built, creating this circumstance all on their own.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.620
And it's also Nintendo.

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.140
It's just Nintendo is just the wrong take on so many things.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:13.980
All right.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:18.940
Let's move on to another sort of mod and questionable usage of IP, right?

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:19.580
Dark soccer.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.380
I guess it's more parodying.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.900
Defend this in just a second.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.500
Let dark soccer talk about our next story.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.140
Next story.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.460
Oh, nevermind.

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.580
Cause I forgot to bring it up.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.300
That was my bad.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.340
So there is a clone out there.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.260
No, this actually, okay, there we go.

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:41.660
Sorry.

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.580
For some reason it kept opening the wrong article.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:54.860
There is a game out there that is a clone based off of squid game.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.580
It's legally distinct.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.580
It is legally distinct.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.460
It is inspired by it.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.180
I should say an offered up for free on steam.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.540
It's called crab game.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:16.540
And it has like different, the different childhood games where you have to basically

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.620
do them or die or do them well and die or die.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.140
Like the floor is lava or red light, green light.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.260
And I don't know how to feel about this, but I want it.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.660
Loki clearly has feelings.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:38.540
This is created by a guy that goes by Danny on, uh, he's a YouTuber and unity developer.

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.340
And he's been making games for a very long time.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.020
He's very entertaining to watch.

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.060
He has another game out.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.020
That's very popular on steam right now called muck, which is kind of a.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:53.500
Survival type game, not, not in Minecraft per se, but it's just like a survival game.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.940
It's just ridiculous.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:58.940
But this, yeah, obviously it is definitely based on

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:06.460
the gameplay of say squid game, but he's taken it to like another level where he's added a

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.940
bunch of unique games into it as well.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:15.740
And, um, different spins on the games that were in the actual show.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:21.100
And I'm saying, I'm saying a lot of this, a lot of my talk is very tongue in cheek because

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.260
I mean the squid game stuff and you're right.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.660
It's all based on childhood games anyway.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.300
So a lot of this stuff is showing up everywhere.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300
Ironically back on in childhood.

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.980
So when kids really shouldn't be watching squid game, but I get, of course they are

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.620
anyway.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.460
And so they're playing Roblox and stuff.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.500
Who does their job anymore?

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:37.740
Right?

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.060
Yeah.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.820
Who is supposed to be a babysitter?

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:40.620
Who cares?

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.940
Yeah.

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.020
So they're playing red light, green light, but I guess when they lose, they get shot

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.140
with a nerf gun or something.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.380
I don't know, but that's what kids do on playgrounds now.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.220
So it is, it's not surprising that of course it makes its way to video games, of course.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.740
And again, it's a, I mean, it's basically fall guys, right?

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.860
I mean, fog and fall guys was before the squid game phenomenon.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.500
Isn't that basically the same thing in a way?

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.100
I mean, obviously no.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.340
Yes, the games are different, but not that different.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:06.380
Yeah.

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.180
It's kind of fun.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.340
I think it's really popular because it's free.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.860
Um, true.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:12.460
Honestly.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.620
Well, he kind of expanded it in the way, like he wanted to take other, like if squid game

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.300
were made in the U S type of thing.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:25.340
So he has a bunch of like, you know, us games like tag or they have like hide and seek bomb

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.620
tags on a thing, but like, they have a game that's sort of like not necessarily splatoon,

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:34.940
but it's kind of like, you know, you have to touch panels on the wall and the floor

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.220
and they change to your color.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:39.500
And, um, of course then there's the red, like green.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.140
Let me tell you, let me tell you a game dark soccer and I never shut up about dead by daylight

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.620
is basically hide and seek and I'm terrible at it.

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:53.420
So it's a little bit more involved, but yeah, it does have some tags, especially the way

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.500
these, especially the way people playing it today.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.660
My God, it has some tag elements.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.100
Yeah.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.620
So it looks fun.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:05.740
It's also, you know, it's, it's popular because, you know, we have everybody streaming it now

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.860
cause everybody wants to get on that like squid game hype.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.580
And now there's like a free to play game that kind of captures that.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:17.260
So everybody's just, I mean, everybody's doing squid game stuff now.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.460
It's just, that's, what's popular.

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:23.260
They just did a big thing with the Minecraft, uh, Minecraft streamers, like 200, you know,

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:24.940
streamers and stuff.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:27.740
And they were doing a squid game in Minecraft.

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.340
And then they have the crab game stuff.

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.220
You have dream.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:33.100
Who's a Minecraft streamer also playing crab game.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:33.980
Just like it.

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.260
It's just insanely popular and it's free to play.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.380
So poor Danny's not getting any, any cash though, from it.

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.980
Make sure you go wishlist, uh, Carlson instead.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:48.140
His, his actual paid game, put ads in that game, buddy, make that coin.

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:48.780
You earned it.

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:54.860
So ma well, maybe he's worried about Netflix, but it's, it sounds like it's super derivative

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.740
enough that it's not, not even close.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.820
There was that story tonight, uh, on Bobby's show, or at least I remember him referencing

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.220
it about that squid game thing that had the NFTs that they were selling like NFTs, the

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:06.460
carrot.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.300
Now that is some bullshittery.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.580
And that's the type of stuff that, you know, it did get shut down.

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.060
Didn't they, didn't they steal like $3 million?

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:14.940
They rug pulled.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:15.180
Yeah.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.180
That's the thing with, and it's not NFTs.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.540
It's like a crypto coin.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:24.700
So these like, um, trash coins or whatever that you will, if, if you hear about these

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.300
new cryptos, it's like, and they, it's more times than not.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.540
It's just rug pulls where you get a bunch of people hyped up and you get them invested

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:32.780
in it.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.380
And then the person that creates the coin takes all the money and leaves, and then the

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.260
coins worth them.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:42.700
If those D bags can take 3.4 million from squid game fans, then what's the guy's name

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.980
that created this crab game?

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.140
Danny, Danny, Danny.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:51.580
He's can put some quick five, five second, 10 second ads in his game and make that coin.

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.140
He deserves it.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.500
He really should.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.460
And also play mock.

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:55.900
Mock is really fun too.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.500
It's also insanely hard.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:57.820
All right.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.060
You got a lot of great games, actually.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.900
DJ says the squid game memes are hilarious.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:09.660
A lot of them are, but, um, yeah, I mean, I guess it was this game, a meme of some sort,

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:09.980
maybe.

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.860
I don't know.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.180
All right.

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.940
Well, a lot of the game has memes from his other games as well.

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.660
Like there's a whole bunch of watches.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:22.300
You have to like, like the red light, green light person, the model that they created

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.420
has his face on it.

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.340
It's just like stretched.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.540
It just looks weird.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.420
But like, it's, it's just silly and it's free.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:31.820
It's just fun.

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:32.460
I don't know.

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.180
I'll check it out.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.540
Let's move on.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.060
Who's got our next story?

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:36.560
Logie?

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500
Yeah, so this is really cool, actually.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:44.300
So there's a brand new feature that's coming to Forza Horizon 5.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:52.700
That adds actual ASL and BSL sign language support to the cinematic.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:58.860
So you actually have an interpreter on screen during the cinematics signing all of the dialogue

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:03.260
in there now, whereas some folks may use like, you know, closed captioning or something like

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:03.760
that.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:14.380
People that may also not be able to hear and also maybe like, you know, dyslexic or whatever

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:19.420
the case may be, might not be able to read captions that easily.

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:26.140
And, you know, the sign language interpreter is much easier to, to understand.

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:31.580
So I think that's just like, it's extremely cool that they put that in this game and just

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.060
the accessibility features are, are insane.

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:39.660
This, this is the kind of shit when they talk about cloud gaming and things that are in

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.700
the cloud.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.980
This is the kind of shit I would love to see the cloud used for.

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:48.940
Is that when somebody would like to have, you know, ASL, I'm assuming, I know ASL is American

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.340
sign language.

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.620
I'm assuming BSL is British.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.700
But please correct me if I'm wrong.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:00.860
But I think it'd be awesome if more games had the ability to, you know, I get it.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.220
It's a lot of data.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.780
They might not be able to fit it all on the disk or in the download or whatever.

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.820
But if somebody could like connect to the cloud and get some of these interpretations,

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:08.860
I think that's awesome.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:13.820
And yeah, you brought up the great points about why captions are good in one way, but

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.940
sign language is even better for other sorts.

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.140
There's also emotion and things that you can convey.

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.420
Yes, that you can convey in sign language that you can't necessarily convey in the written

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.060
words.

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:30.220
If you want to see what I'm talking about and folks that can hear will absolutely notice

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:30.780
this as well.

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.340
Go look at somebody sign languaging a rap concert.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.100
These videos go viral once in a while.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.180
I'm sure they've got to be all over TikTok.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:47.580
I actually want to interject on this one because my uncle is an interpreter and I know a little

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.080
ASL.

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.500
Part of actually speaking sign language is facial expression.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.620
It is an integral part of sign language.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:06.300
You have to cultivate certain emotions for certain things that, you know, facial responses

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.860
to convey the right terms across.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:12.300
And don't forget, there are also different dialects of ASL.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:24.700
And so it is a lot going into it, but having the face to go with it is absolutely essential

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.780
to proper communication in ASL.

01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:32.140
Yeah, so I don't think anyone looks at this and sees it as a bad thing.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.220
I think some people have that curiosity.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.580
Well, don't they have closed captioning?

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.620
But now we've explained it.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:40.460
There's a very big difference between the two with the emotion and everything.

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:46.140
And again, Google somebody signing in a rap concert or look it up on TikTok.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:50.220
Share one in chat if you got a good one and you will see exactly what we're talking about.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.860
There's a reason those videos go viral all the time.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.260
All right, let's move on.

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:55.980
I don't know.

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.540
It's interesting.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.380
I'm doing this story, not dark soccer, but that's okay.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.420
We'll talk about Google Stadia.

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.780
And the reason I actually had clicked on that because the moment I saw Stadia, I thought

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:03.280
it was mine.

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:04.860
No, no, it wasn't.

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.900
It wasn't in your pool.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.780
So I took it out of your pool.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.260
I should have given it to you as that other one, but that's all right.

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:14.140
Anyway, what I wanted to talk about with this is that, well, you can comment to your heart's

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:14.780
content, please.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.580
It's a collaborative show.

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:21.820
Google Stadia did start doing free trials back in October, and they're going to be adding

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.060
more.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:25.740
And when I say free trials, this means you don't have to have Stadia Pro for this.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:31.740
You can be a free Stadia user and you can actually get two more games you can test drive.

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:37.100
Control Ultimate Edition, which of course that one game of the year things up the wazoo.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.860
And that is a freebie on Stadia Pro, just saying.

01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.180
Right.

01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.060
But even if you don't have Stadia Pro, you can still test run it.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.740
Well, no, I'm just saying the difference is that as opposed to a trial without Stadia

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.060
Pro on Stadia Pro, they were giving it away for free.

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:50.560
Nice.

01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:56.460
And then I believe Hello Engineer is the other one that they're doing.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:56.860
Am I?

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:57.740
No, no.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.660
Hello Engineer was the first one they did.

01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:03.420
And then I'm sorry, the other game is Riders Republic from Ubisoft.

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.940
So that's pretty neat.

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.940
And the Resident Evil Village one is still up too.

01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:08.300
Oh, cool.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:09.500
Yeah.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.860
Last I checked, I can't actually look at my phone.

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.820
And if I launch Stadia right now, Dead by Daylight will come up.

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.940
But yeah.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:25.020
So if you're curious about Stadia, you know, and you want to take it for a test drive,

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.620
you have plenty of ways to do that now with these free trials and so forth.

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.700
If you're curious, how does the cloud gaming work?

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:33.340
I should say Microsoft's gotten more and more in this too.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.900
You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week, because I didn't play enough

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:41.020
of it, but I started up the Marvel Avengers game in the cloud because you know, that game

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.140
is like 100 gig download.

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.540
I'm like, I don't have the bandwidth for that, but I want to try this.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.780
So I started to do that first little area.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.780
If you've played the Avengers game, you know what I'm talking about?

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.060
That first little Avenger, how do they call it?

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.580
Like the celebration.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.220
It was half price on Steam, but still full price on Stadia.

01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.360
Yeah.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.140
So, but, but on the, um, it's on game pass, Microsoft, you can play it on the cloud through

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:04.540
Microsoft game pass on your console.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.660
Now that's the big deal.

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.780
I'd already done cloud gaming on my PC, but this was me playing the adventures on my TV

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:11.820
and it wasn't bad at all.

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.740
Again, it was like watching a YouTube.

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.820
You see a little bit of, uh, you know, like kind of artifact ingraininess that you would

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:20.460
see on a YouTube, but it wasn't terrible by any means.

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.980
Um, certainly better than spending the a hundred gigs to download it, to take it for a test

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:24.620
drive.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:27.340
So maybe cloud gaming really is the future.

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:31.980
You know, I feel like I'm, you know, integrating it more and more and getting, you know, it's

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.380
great for taking things for a test spin and so forth.

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.980
Certainly what dark soccer is doing is, is a great test case for it as well.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:41.740
There's, I think we're going to see the cloud thing more and more honestly, in the, um,

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:45.100
you know, coming years, another quick little update with Stadia.

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:49.420
Uh, you can actually jump into friends games now.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.340
Um, so, uh, for example, far cry six is one of them.

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:59.020
Uh, you can actually go right into, um, somebody else's current game, but somebody does have

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.940
to enable their privacy settings for that.

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.540
Of course you can imagine why.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:06.220
So if you go into your privacy tab of Stadia and in the current game, there's an option

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.580
that says, join your current game.

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.900
And if you enable that, then somebody can join your game unannounced, which some people

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.300
would love.

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.340
Some people would hate.

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:14.460
So you can pick that.

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:18.540
You can also, of course, set it to friends, um, and all players.

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.580
I don't know why you'd do that.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.060
I guess if you really want to do something multiplayer, you could.

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.580
Um, so that's kind of neat.

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:28.700
Um, it's also what you would expect on some of the other services like Xbox live and PlayStation.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:32.700
So it is nice that Stadia has got that now in the cloud, um, section as well.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.460
So good for them.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.980
All right, now we're going to get into, forget this cloud gaming stuff.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:43.500
We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no cloud.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.220
It was all on a disc in our next segment.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:31:03.580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.900
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:15.580
And once a month, dark soccer instead picks a fucking weird arcade game, but I think everyone

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.540
knows this one.

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:17.660
At least I hope they do.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.260
And this is an amazing pick.

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:19.820
Dark soccer.

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.940
What is the flag tonight?

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:27.420
Okay, so it is a game that a lot of people know, but it was really freaking weird when

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:27.980
it came out.

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.940
So it's part of it.

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.220
Don't get me wrong.

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:39.740
So it's the typing of the dead, which was funny when I was pulling up the video for

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:39.900
it.

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:44.220
I hear from the other room, are you playing the house of the dead?

01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:50.060
No, but it was funny because Dan does like recognize the music from like the first two

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:50.560
bars.

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:56.220
Typing of the Dead was an arcade game that was developed by Wow Entertainment, published

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.220
by Sega for the NAOMI hardware.

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:05.660
It came out in 1999 in Japan and then had a port to Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit.

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:12.300
There was another version for Windows that came out in 2000 in the PS2 port in 2004.

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:19.660
So this is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun game.

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:24.940
The House of the Dead 2, where instead of a gun, you have a keyboard.

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:33.980
And so you type to kill your enemies and, you know, typing faster is better.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.340
You know, you've got to type before the enemy is going to attack you.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.660
And it's really, really cool.

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:47.740
It was actually considered a form of edutainment when it came out, and a lot of critics actually

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.580
said, hey, this is great.

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.860
It's funny.

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.140
It can be difficult.

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.020
It's original.

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:59.900
The PC version of Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003.

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:07.020
The PS2 port was called Typing of the Dead Zombicanic, and it was released in Japan December

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.580
2004, and it came with USB keyboard.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.500
There was Typing of the Dead 2 that came out in Japan.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:18.540
English of the Dead, which was a revision for House of the Dead 2, was also released

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.540
to learn as a language learning game in Japan for the Nintendo DS.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:27.340
And then there's an iOS remake that was called Flick of the Dead.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:32.300
And then it was, of course, Typing of the Dead Overkill, which was based on House of

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:36.380
the Dead Overkill, came out for Windows in October 2015.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.380
And we have the distinction of having a text pack.

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:44.460
These are special, and awesome, and educational.

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:49.500
Anyway, so it is just House of the Dead 2.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.940
It's, you know, rail shooter.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.140
You just type text shit.

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:57.900
You can actually play the Japanese version fairly easily.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:05.340
I don't think it has too many non-English characters in it.

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:11.500
But the thing I need to point out, and this is why I'm bringing this one up, is that it

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:16.380
is not the only keyboard game that's been out.

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.220
I mean, we have...

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:24.220
There was the one that was the loop on the third, the typing.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.140
Oh, yeah.

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.580
I think I've never seen that once.

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.500
Yeah, which is actually what I almost picked.

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.140
And it's another Sega game.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:39.660
It was developed by WoW, as well, published on the NAOMI system.

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:44.220
So it was based off of Loop in the Third, the shooting that came out the year before

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:44.720
that.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:50.700
So there are just a variety of, you know...

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.940
I think there's another one.

01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.820
There was...

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:03.500
Can I say really quick while you're while you're brainstorming?

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.260
Neon Ships was, I think, one.

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat reminds, and I was going to bring this up, I promise.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:14.860
I was going to Dark Soccer get to the segment, but a reminder that for the Steam version

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.740
of the game, because again, this game is incredible.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.540
Check it out.

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.660
But there's the OLR mod.

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:24.460
It's an official Steam mod that I put out.

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:25.900
I want to say Episode 6.

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.020
You did mention that.

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:27.740
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:28.540
Which I talked about.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.100
I'm sorry.

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.420
I went AFK to the potty and I caught up on chat.

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:31.920
Sorry.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.120
It's okay.

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:38.540
Well, I didn't say specifically Steam, but I did say it was the Windows version.

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:39.040
Gotcha.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.020
But there we go.

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:50.540
And of course, it's got three different endings based on how you answer the questions that

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.740
the Emperor asks.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:56.460
You have the explosion ending where you defeat the Emperor.

01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:01.580
You see Goldman falling off of a building, and then there's an explosion when he hits

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.740
the ground and you have to type honest answers to questions during the boss fight.

01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.260
So that's how you get that one.

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:15.180
There's the bungee ending where if you do untruthful or strange answers during the boss

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:22.220
fight, then you get a bungee cord attached to Goldman's leg, and he returns to where

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.740
he came from and burps.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:30.460
And then you have the Superman ending where you have to do untruthful answers only to

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.980
the questions asked in the boss fight.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:40.460
And instead of him jumping, Goldman jumping off or falling off, he waves to the narrator

01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.340
and raises his hands and rises into the sky.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.260
And that's it.

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.660
So it got great reviews.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:52.140
Like I said, Famitsu gave it 35 out of 40.

01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:59.180
Everyone thought it was just so absurd that it's just, it was hilarious.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.540
Game Informer named it the weirdest game of all time.

01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:09.020
The graphics have, of course, been criticized because, I mean, it wasn't updated from House

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:17.900
of the Dead 2, and there's actually even PC World said it was a runner up on the top 10

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:18.940
worst games list.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.300
What the fuck do they know?

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:21.580
They don't have sense of the femur.

01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:30.220
But yeah, they're probably holding up the new steam release to or I say no, but it's

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:30.780
a few years old.

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.500
They're holding that up to, like, new guidelines.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.660
And I think they're probably looking at it through the wrong.

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:40.940
This is 2014 still when it was ranked as one of the worst.

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:42.300
Yeah.

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.700
So that wasn't that the year that it came out on steam?

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.900
I don't know.

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:59.420
But even so, I mean, they said they didn't think the concept was that novel.

01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:00.620
Whatever.

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.300
Then go play something else.

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:09.580
I mean, honestly, the House of the Dead, any of the typing of the dead ones, like, they

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:10.800
don't.

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.940
They're really fun.

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:19.260
They like, I remember going to Jessica's house and us both having our keyboards.

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:27.340
Two player house typing of the dead and having the best time.

01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.380
Of course, sometimes there was drinking involved and then we would play drunk and that was

01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:30.880
terrible.

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:38.140
But yeah, it's probably up there with one of my favorite games.

01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:41.580
But it is definitely a fucking weird arcade game when it came out.

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.620
Absolutely.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:43.660
Great pick.

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:44.220
There it is.

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.260
Your flag.

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.060
Oh, the month.

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:51.980
The typing of the dead, or is our DJ on the chat says this game looks better than the

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.480
movie.

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.180
Everything looks better.

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.700
Everything looks better than that movie.

01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:57.980
So there you go.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.860
All right.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:38:59.420
Great pick.

01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.260
Great trip down memory lane.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:04.060
Great chance to plug the OLR mod that's out there.

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.780
That honestly should go back and update.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.940
I just I will caution.

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:16.700
A lot of the stuff that's in there is old, like it's old references to the show when

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:20.700
it was a little more wild and we had more people here every week for the show.

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.140
Like, you know, there used to have, you know, we crammed like six people in the studio every

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.340
week and we had all that.

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:30.140
So there's a lot of like old jokes that might not resonate with if you found the show in

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.100
the past five years.

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.540
But I still think it's I think it's neat that we did a mod.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.540
We should do an updated pack for reasons.

01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.380
I was going to say we should do an updated one, but I also I'm like, well, what updated

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.260
jokes do we have?

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.100
I need the help of some OLR historians to add stuff in there.

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.540
I'm happy to do an update, though.

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.740
I think it would be fun.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:55.260
So and I think Questbuster really sums it up for me in chat over twitch.tv slash vog

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.860
network saying this is one of the reasons I love Sega.

01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:02.940
They're willing to take risks like this from time to time, even now.

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.940
So and agree.

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.260
That's I think what a lot I mean, just think of all that crazy shit from the late 90s Sega

01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:09.980
Dreamcast era.

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:11.020
Samba de Amigo.

01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:15.820
Hello, weird Space Channel five wild crazy taxi.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.700
Crazy.

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:20.140
You know, it's just that's now that stuff.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:23.580
I don't know if it's just because we're in a certain generation of gamers or what, but

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:29.740
all that stuff is like the peak of gaming in many ways for many of us, I think so.

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.780
She Hulk 10 in chat says, what's flag?

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.900
Flag stands for fucking weird arcade game.

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.860
And it's because every month of the week.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:43.340
Of the of the month, because every of the week of the month.

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.580
But I just do them all the time, but I'll run out.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.460
They're all weird.

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:52.700
We've been doing a yearly twist since twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen, where Dark Sakura

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.940
mixes it up and once a month she does something different.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.900
So one year she did classic consoles.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.300
I think soundtracks was one year.

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.900
There was one other one, I think.

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.380
Oh, peripherals was last year, if I remember right.

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:06.380
So I did pinballs.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:07.260
Yeah.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.340
This this I don't think you did pinballs yet.

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.180
Maybe that's not pinball.

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:11.740
Did you?

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.140
Did you?

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:13.500
Yeah.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:19.180
OK, time flies because I had to I gave myself a limit that they were anything that was at

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.820
the beginning of using the DMD system for scoring.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.060
Wow.

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:22.700
Yeah, you're right.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.100
You're right.

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:26.940
OK, so then this now we're at the this is me.

01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:30.060
I know, but it's just like it all blurs together.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.140
And also, to be fair, you talk about pinball a lot.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:36.860
OK, it doesn't need its own statement, but I love him.

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.260
It's fine.

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.940
Who doesn't love the ball so that this year the twist was the fucking weird arcade game

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.820
where Dark Sakura would pick a game that was really crazy in arcades.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.900
And, you know, again, I would urge you all to go to the wiki, which is orange lounge

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.980
radio dot fandom dot com.

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.300
Now, I think it used to be Wikia, but they want some company bought the other.

01:41:56.300 --> 01:42:00.060
So and yeah, as Joe and Matt says, there's only one more flag left.

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:00.620
That's right.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:02.140
December is the only month left.

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:07.100
So Dark Sakura will go out with a bang and then got to think of next year's one.

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.780
I know some ideas have come up, but we'll let Dark Sakura pick what she wants to do

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.100
as we move into 2022 and the 20th year of the show.

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:21.020
The 20th year in my worst arcade game, what's that?

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.980
I'll do worst game of the month, worst game of the month.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.500
You've picked some stinkers, but I mean, you can do more stinkers.

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:28.540
I'll think of something.

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.100
There's a lot of shitty games out there.

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:31.600
All right.

01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.300
Thank you, Orange Right, who sends a link.

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.740
And so you can see all the previous classic games and the different themes and all that

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:38.220
stuff.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.020
So there you go.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.220
All right.

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:41.580
Halo.

01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:42.380
OK, Bobby.

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:47.900
Bobby says finally, Halo gets in legit with the worst game of the month.

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:55.020
I'm going to say, remember, I did Halo for a lot of money for my mother and it was legit

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.620
and it was legit.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.660
If I do another Halo game.

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:11.980
I don't even know, maybe, maybe, maybe something will happen, maybe one of the prizes for like

01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.940
a subathon or something will be I do Halo two.

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.740
It's got to be a subathon here, though.

01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:19.100
Vogue Network.

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.020
I didn't say I wouldn't do it for myself.

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.060
I do it here.

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.500
OK, all right.

01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:25.340
Who do you think I am?

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:28.060
Of course, I would do it on my own.

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:28.620
Capitalist.

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.860
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:32.460
All right, moving on.

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.460
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some things going on in the industry

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.420
rather quickly.

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.140
And we will go to, I think, Loki first.

01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:48.620
Yeah, so, you know, I've been a big fan of Lego stuff and we were buying most of the

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.740
Mario sets.

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.740
We've kind of stopped because we got too many of them and my son doesn't want to build the

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:54.700
ones I buy for him.

01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.660
So there's a lot of them.

01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:57.180
There is a lot.

01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.580
So as you may remember, Lego Luigi is a thing now.

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.860
He was introduced back in August, I believe.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:12.220
And now they've got some more Luigi centric sets, including the brand new Luigi's Mansion

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:13.660
sets that are coming out.

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:19.900
So there's actually one there's a brand new like entryway expansion set that they've got

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.260
for like 40 bucks.

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.900
It looks kind of cool with some of the ghosts from the game.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:31.660
There is a the lab and Poltergust expansion set, which gives you the actual Poltergust

01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.220
suit that Luigi can wear.

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:41.660
And as also Professor Egad in there, and then they have a more elaborate set, which is the

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:45.660
haunt and seek expansion set, which is 80 bucks.

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.540
And it's got like a bunch of stuff from like a haunted house in there, including King Boo.

01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:53.500
But pretty elaborate stuff.

01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.940
Probably won't be buying that, though, but neat.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.620
I like to see more Mario sets.

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:05.180
And then obviously, that partnership is doing very well for both those companies.

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.300
Yes, yes, yes.

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:12.380
And then also, of course, we've got an update to Super Mario 3D All Stars.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:16.620
You may remember that was a game that was released back in September of last year.

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:19.500
And then they just continued in March when they.

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:25.820
Decided to roll out their expansion pass for their Nintendo online.

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:26.700
No, no, no, no, no.

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:28.140
It's a limited celebration.

01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.020
It's a celebration.

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:33.980
Eventually, the celebration has to read that was driving that.

01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:36.380
Eventually, the lights have to go out.

01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.620
Eventually, the hors d'oeuvres spoil.

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.260
So here's OK.

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:48.380
So to that to to that, this is going to be the most unnecessary expansion ever, but or

01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:49.100
update ever.

01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:55.100
So Super Mario 3D All Stars is adding Nintendo 64 controller support.

01:45:55.740 --> 01:46:01.100
But you may remember that the Nintendo 64 controller, aside from being impossible to

01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:04.540
get right now because it's Nintendo and they don't know how to manage the supply chain,

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:11.820
you could only purchase that if you had the expansion pass through Nintendo online,

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.580
which you would have already gotten Mario Super Mario 64.

01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:20.300
But hey, if you want to play it again on a copy, you already bought now.

01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.100
They're letting you do that.

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:24.300
How generous of them.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:28.060
I don't know.

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.020
It's stupid.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:29.980
It's so stupid.

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:35.980
It's weird to see that get a patch, but I mean, it makes it's nice that they're supporting

01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:40.380
it, but like it's the hoops you got to jump through to be able to do that is just stupid.

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.060
It's nice, but I don't care.

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.260
Like that's that sums me up, I guess.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:48.220
All right, Dar Sakura, you've got one for us.

01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:49.520
I do.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:59.280
It looks like that filming for The Last of Us is actually done.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.520
Neil Druckmann posted, and I'll read this verbatim.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.360
Alas, my time in Canada has come to an end to the best TV crew in the world.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:10.880
Thank you for your incredible work, your passion, and for making me feel so welcome.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.080
I will miss you terribly.

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.800
Excited to return to Naughty Dog and some warmer weather.

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:27.120
And yeah, he put a picture of a clapboard with The Last of Us on it, and it's the same

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.240
font, but red with like a design on it.

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.920
And yeah, it might be done filming completely, so we'll see.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.960
Now to edit it and get all the special effects done.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.480
So it's still probably going to be a little while, but I think that the bar is pretty

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.600
high for that, but it looks like they've got a good cast.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.640
So be very curious to see how that turns out for sure.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.140
Totally.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Speaking of media, I've got a story for you guys.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.160
And this trailer, I know, showed up in our Discord over at vognetwork.com

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.000
slash Discord because, you know, who doesn't love Neil Patrick Harris?

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.560
And that's why everybody's sharing this movie, right?

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.600
Well, I'm sure that's part of it.

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.280
But the other part is it plays in the Nintendo hardcore.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.640
So it's a movie coming to HBO Max called 8-Bit Christmas.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.720
And it's talking about it.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.160
Look, I'm gonna be honest.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.520
I watched the trailer.

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.800
And to me, it's just completely trying to rip off a Christmas story and get that same

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.680
sort of vibe.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.840
But instead of a BB gun, it's a Nintendo.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:28.640
What this has to do with video games, I'm not exactly sure, but I guess we can expect

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.040
to see Nintendo stuff featured in the movie.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.960
And of course, it's just tugging at our heartstrings because a lot of us look at that and go,

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.360
oh, oh, that was me going to my friend's house trying to play the Nintendo and all that stuff.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.320
It would have been a perfect time for them to do some sort of partnership deal to re-release

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.040
the NES Classic Edition, wouldn't you think?

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.080
That's how a smart business person thinks.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.440
That's how a smart business person thinks.

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.600
But this is Nintendo and they won't do that.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.240
Anyway, the trailer's all over.

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:00.080
I'm sure many of you guys have seen it by now.

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.360
It's on HBO Max.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.560
It has Neil Patrick Harris.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.440
I will wait to see what my friends think of it.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.560
I'm not exactly in a rush to watch it, but it's not because completely that I'm a bitch.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:16.640
It's just that I don't, you know, I watch a lot more Twitch and I play a lot more video

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.800
games and I really have to be intentional if I'm going to break to watch a movie or

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.680
something like that.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.800
Tigerclaw does point out that it's based on a book.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.880
Mike Deff says it's nostalgia bait, but I'll watch because of Neil Patrick Harris.

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.320
And that's where I'm kind of like not going to write it off completely.

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:33.520
I do love that man.

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.880
So yeah.

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:38.080
And by the way, did y'all see his Halloween?

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.840
Like every year that family goes all out for Halloween and it's amazing.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.120
It's also those kids are growing up.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.560
Those kids are like 10 or 11 now.

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.120
So they do amazing stuff in the new Matrix movie.

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.160
That's right.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.560
Yeah, that Matrix movie has a hell of a cast.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.080
That is a movie I will set aside the time to watch.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:54.560
Guaranteed.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.920
I will borrow a friend's HBO Max.

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.240
Actually, I might go to the fucking theater to see it quite honestly.

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.760
I'll see it in the theater.

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.600
Anyway, Tigerclaw says it's based on the book.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.440
Yes, there is a book on it.

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.040
And so it comes from that.

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.920
So was A Christmas Story, which is the original nostalgia porn.

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.840
I think that ties into this.

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.480
All right, let's move on.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480
Travel around the world and check out some releases.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.680
Actually, no, I lied.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.040
I'm going to insert a story here in Rapid Fire News because we had a really good one

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.280
shared by Bobby in chat.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.320
And I think this is worth sharing.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.680
I should save this for last minute stories, but I'm not going to.

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.200
Because this is kind of huge.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:41.040
Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 going to be removed from PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.360
Nintendo 3DS and so on in those stores.

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.480
They're saying it's temporary.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.160
Apparently, there is historical archive footage that appears in the game.

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.400
The licenses have expired.

01:50:53.120 --> 01:51:00.000
Konami is therefore legally obligated to yank the game until they can either fix it and

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.600
remove that footage, which I doubt they're going to use the resources to do, or they're

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:09.680
going to, I guess, try to reinstate the licenses.

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.760
They are saying in this press release on their official site, konami.com.

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.080
We sincerely ask for your patience and understanding as we work towards making these products available

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.360
for purchase once again.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.760
So they are going to try to get them back up again.

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:27.600
There's a lot of this affects the GOG version of Metal Gear Solid 2.

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.560
Many PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.280
I mean, the storefronts are already kind of on their way out as it is.

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:38.480
PlayStation Now, that's the when I see that, that's the big one.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.240
They have to yank it off the cloud.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.520
Something to think about with these licenses and expiring and the cloud gaming we're moving

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.520
to just that's the one that catches my eye is the PlayStation Now version of the game

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.720
is going to disappear.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:51.520
Hmm.

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.960
So anyway, and that involves for PlayStation Now and PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.040
That's the HD collection.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.440
They have to throw out the whole collection for now because, of course, it includes number

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.320
two and number three.

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:05.840
So interesting.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.120
Garth the Wolf in chat says, Konami looking sus.

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.840
Well, it is legal obligations.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.600
It's just what good news is coming out of Konami lately?

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:16.080
I'll wait.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.080
Oh, the new BeatMania 2DX.

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:21.200
I really want to play that.

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.840
That's, I guess, there's your good news for Konami.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.280
The rest?

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.640
Well, we have a story on E-Football coming up later, and I will just let that speak for

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.140
itself.

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:31.060
Anyhow.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.480
All right.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.040
Oh, yeah.

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:37.600
Darticuya says, remember Dynamite Rave literally had to be rewritten about 2009 or so.

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.760
Yeah, they are not good with licensing sometimes.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.260
Yes.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.880
How about the Silent Hill remaster?

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.320
Enough said.

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.800
I don't like the remake.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.480
Oh, yeah.

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:48.720
Okay.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.520
Sacred Jade.

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.240
I will.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:50.560
Okay.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.040
Yes.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:51.280
Yes.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:51.600
I will.

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.360
I will golf clap that response.

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.960
Castlevania collection.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:57.280
That is some good news that came out of Konami.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.680
I do want to point out they did contract with that other company to make the game for them.

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.800
However, point taken.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.000
Point acknowledged.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.200
Golf clap earned.

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:07.600
Thank you.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:08.720
All right.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:09.520
All right.

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.400
Orange Rite is now putting out the TurboGrafx-16 mini.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.640
I will give you one clap because that was last year.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:14.960
All right.

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.000
Enough.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:17.120
Moving on.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.080
You all know the point I'm trying to make.

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.360
It's a hot mess over there.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.000
All right.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.800
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:28.720
from Konami or otherwise in the coming week.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.560
And we'll go to the US and Loki.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:31.920
Yes.

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:38.720
So we have Blue Reflection, Second Light on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:46.640
Football Manager 2022 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, iOS, and

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.200
Android.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:53.280
Forza Horizon 5 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:01.200
We have Jurassic World Evolution 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:02.320
Xbox Series.

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.720
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Anniversary Edition.

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.280
That's right.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.240
Todd Howard is doing it again, and he's going to make you buy Skyrim again, even though

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.280
they already did a remastered anniversary edition before.

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:23.360
That's coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.080
The Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy, the definitive edition.

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.680
Sure enough, it is definitive until they release another one.

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.680
That's also coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.480
Xbox Series.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.120
If they do another one, would it be redefinitive?

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.920
It's a serious question.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.800
In the Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar Games doesn't want to make a new game.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.640
PUBG The New State on iOS and Android, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Nintendo

01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:03.040
Switch, and finally, we've got Shin Megami Tensei 5 on Nintendo Switch.

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:03.440
That's it.

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.760
All right, going to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:12.320
You bet Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a huge release this week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.560
It has a regular edition, a limited edition.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:18.720
There's even some peripherals that are coming out that are Shin Megami Tensei branded, of

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.400
course, because that game is huge.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.040
So you can check all that out on the 11th when the game launches there.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.840
There are some other titles on the Nintendo Switch as well.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.720
What Would Dare go up against Shin Megami Tensei?

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.120
How about Laid Back Camp, Have a Nice Day?

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.160
That is out this week.

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.840
Dragon Quest X, Heroes of the Heavenly Stars online.

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:36.320
I'm not sure.

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:37.520
That must be some type of re-release.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:40.160
I don't know if that's the first time on the Switch or what it is, but that is out

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.360
as well in Japan this week.

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.120
And Megaton Musashi is out this week as well in Japan.

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:50.160
And Labyrinth of Galleria, Coven of Dusk is all out this week on the Nintendo Switch.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:54.080
Looking at the PlayStation 4, I imagine you have some of the similar stuff.

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.240
Yep, we have Megaton Musashi is also out this week in the Dragon Quest game.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.880
Also on PlayStation 4.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:05.840
Let me check PS5 and see if any of those games made it over there this week.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:13.760
No, the next release is a Battlefield 2042, Japan's release, excuse me, on the 19th.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.680
So we're still a little ways from that.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.160
Let's go to the UK and Dark Sakura.

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.320
I think you have a mute.

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.480
Yes, you have a Discord mute.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:32.560
On the 9th, we have Forza Horizon 5 on Xbox.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.360
For Xbox and PlayStation, Jurassic World Evolution 2 on the same day.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.960
The rest of these are on the 12th.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:41.440
We have Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.040
We have Game & Watch The Legend of Zelda.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.100
Nice.

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.280
We have Shin Megami Tensei V5.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.520
I did the thing.

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.760
I hate that I did the thing and I did the thing.

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.600
Shin Megami Tensei V.

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.680
And then Let's Sing 2022.

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.520
I did the thing, Rob.

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.360
How dare I do the thing?

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:03.920
I know.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.280
I'm going to clip that.

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:05.520
All right.

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.240
No, just kidding.

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:07.440
No, do not.

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:09.120
All right.

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.000
Let's move on and get some more headlines.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.160
And then, of course, we'll take your calls and your emails and all that good stuff and

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.600
really make it your show a little later on with the listener roundtable.

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.720
But for now, we have some more headlines to talk about, starting with Loki.

01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:36.560
Yeah, so this is a story Nintendo has promised to continually to improve the switch online

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:43.120
since there's been some backlash basically saying in there and was that their investor

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:48.640
meeting, I believe that the last month we released in the switch online plus expansion

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:52.240
pack a new membership plan that adds content to the existing service.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.880
Going forward, we will continue to improve and expand on both Nintendo Switch Online

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.440
and Nintendo Switch Online Plus expansion pack striving to provide services that satisfy

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:01.940
customers.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:07.840
Yeah, I better hope you better be continually improving that service.

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.840
I mean, that's the point of a service that you're charging fifty dollars for.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.160
Sony doesn't Sony or Microsoft doesn't just charge it and go, OK, we're done.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.200
We're done putting out content.

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:24.080
Well, I also took it about the split that they have and now they have two levels and

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:27.600
everybody's thinking, well, this basic level is going to be trash now because they want

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.200
people to pay more for the premium level.

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:32.800
So I kind of read it as Nintendo kind of recommitting to both levels.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.720
And to confirm, like I even though.

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.120
I didn't pay for the expansion pack, meaning I did download I did pay for the DLC, though,

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.960
for Animal Crossing, but I'm not I'm not paying for the expansion back.

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:53.840
So they miss out on the five dollars there, but it's still it's stupid, like it's just

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.040
a principal thing for me, like I don't know.

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:57.600
Thank you.

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.760
Like, I'm not giving you more money, especially when you haven't proved with the current

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:06.800
expansion pass stuff that you're willing to continually update it.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:09.680
I mean, it's just minimal effort being put in by them.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.080
Yeah.

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:14.640
So sorry, I'm not going to you can promise all you want, but you haven't shown that you're

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.360
going to do it.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:15.760
Yep.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.400
Actions.

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:22.720
I mean, I understand they have to playing Yakuza games has taught me that the board

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.240
meetings are very important and you have to please the board of directors.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.440
But I get it.

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.240
With the shareholder meetings, you have to talk a lot of talk.

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:34.720
But for us, the gamers, we got to see the action and we got to see the you know, the

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.080
stuff that really makes it worth it.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:37.280
So we'll see.

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:42.320
I'm curious what big free thing Nintendo is going to try to throw at the game and Game

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.440
Boy Advance games.

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:44.320
That's what they're going to do.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.600
That's the easiest.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.040
Like, come on.

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.760
I think there needs to be something more like, yes, sure.

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.920
I like Game Boy, Game Boy Advance games, but I think there needs to be.

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:52.560
Here's the problem.

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.120
Here's the problem.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:58.560
If Game Boy and Game Boy Advance does not include Pokemon, forget it.

01:59:58.560 --> 01:59:59.440
And that's the thing.

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.040
Everybody hears Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.800
They think, oh, well, I want to play the Pokemon games.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.320
You better get you better level set those expectations.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:12.480
Because technically those games are from the Pokemon company, which is like second party.

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:17.840
So I don't, you know, and also Nintendo can, you know, as they're doing with the fourth

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:21.760
gen, just remake those games and charge a whole separate premium for them and people

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:22.400
will pay it.

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:27.040
So don't assume Pokemon games are going to be a part of that.

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:28.160
So what's left?

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.840
There's Metro, the original Metroid 2, you know, there's some other, you know, not to

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.440
say obviously there are some good, but I just think the highlights are not going to be what

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.640
you all want them to be.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.280
That's my thought.

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.760
So, all right.

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:48.240
Moving on and on a similar note with Nintendo, and I think we kind of addressed this on a

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.400
previous show, but it's kind of continue.

02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:54.800
I want to say this got brought up again this week because of that same shareholder meeting.

02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:01.040
Nikkei Asia is talking about that Nintendo is going to make 20% fewer Switch consoles

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.400
through the end of the fiscal year.

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.040
And this all ties into the chip shortage that's going on.

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:08.880
That means 24 million fewer units than what was planned.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:13.520
And yeah, that's basically the headline.

02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.960
I mean, yes, there's still a lot of games when you consider Metroid Dread, the new old

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.960
Mario Party that came out and, you know, the other things that are on the horizon for next

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:26.720
year or Animal Crossing 2.0, if you will.

02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.640
Next year, Splatoon 3, Bayonetta 3, but the reality is the chip shortage is just playing

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:34.880
into how many Switches they can make.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.840
And if that doesn't scream the answer to what happened to the 4K Switch.

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:47.040
Ah, that's I mean, and we said that then it's probably because of the chip shortage.

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.320
And Nintendo hardware is already hard enough to come by.

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:51.600
Now put this on top of it.

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:52.800
It's going to be a nightmare.

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.400
So on when you consider all that, I am glad Nintendo put off the 4K Switch to be quite

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.800
honest, like because I do not want to have to I do not want to have to Squid Game to

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.840
win a 4K Switch.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:12.720
So do that when the chip shortage is looking a little better.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:20.320
Speaking of whatever's in the future for Nintendo in that interesting meeting, they did

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.920
confirm there's another Nintendo console in the works for release 20XX.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.480
Great.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.600
So we get a new Nintendo console coming out before 2099.

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:38.320
It's interesting that a lot of websites are running that as a headline because no fucking

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:38.720
shit.

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.960
Nintendo is working on a new console.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:41.520
Guess what?

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.680
I feel like I've said this before.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.400
I'm going to say it again.

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.480
PlayStation is working on PlayStation 6.

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:47.600
What?

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.600
But it's so early.

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.320
These things take years to come up with years of development, trial and error, cost analysis,

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.440
parts.

02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.120
Now that we're seeing launch games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:04.560
So yes, of course, they're working on a successor to the Switch.

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:12.080
I think the real question is, has the 4K Switch been scrapped altogether for a future like

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.000
is the future Nintendo console now a 4K Switch?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.400
Because that's I think that's where it ends up.

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.800
But we'll see.

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.520
Anyhow, on a completely different note, Dark Sakura.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:27.780
Well.

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:33.120
We often call politics a game, right?

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:39.040
Some of us do, because it really can just go back and forth and one tries to win versus

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:39.540
the other.

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:47.680
There's actually a Kickstarter now to make a game and to teach about politics and the

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.600
nature of how it works.

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.840
It's called Political Arena, created by Elliot Nelson, who is a journalist who wrote for

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.600
Huffington Post until 2018.

02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.520
So you legislate.

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.480
And this is actually the quote.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:05.520
You can legislate, you can campaign, you can navigate the media, you can weather scandals,

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.840
you can try and pick apart the myriad interests on K Street and other special interests.

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:15.920
So you customize your politician and then decide how to invest their time.

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.640
And then you can see how weak or strong they are in certain skills.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.320
And then the game plays out from there.

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:30.320
So if you are a fan of, you know, following politicians or kind of want to see a little

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:36.720
bit about, you know, what all you'd have to juggle for it, you could sign up for the Kickstarter.

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.720
It looks kind of interesting.

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:49.280
Like one of the screenshots on here is like Senator Olin misspells butter, which how many

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.480
times have we seen?

02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:54.320
People drug for their grammar.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:54.800
Oh, sure.

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:55.840
What by me?

02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:01.280
How how many of us are old enough to remember the whole potato shenanigans with Vice President

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.160
Quayle at the time?

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.280
That was it's very much a reference to that.

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:08.480
Yeah, we had way too many of them with the dumpster that we just got used to it.

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:09.940
Yeah.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.840
What's interesting about this to me, you know, political games are nothing new.

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:19.920
I mean, hello, we had that guy who made cat president like the actual.

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.040
Yeah, that's a political game of sorts, a little tongue in cheek.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.240
But I remember playing a game on like the Commodore 64 in the 80s.

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:27.760
It was like a campaign manager game.

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:32.080
But it's not that the political game element is new, but it's interesting that the talent

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:37.040
behind this and that there is, you know, people that might bring some sort of, you know, I

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:42.000
don't know if you want to call it insider, but sort of like just more like weathered,

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.560
I guess, experiences into a game.

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.440
I think that's interesting.

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:54.720
Well, the producer, Diana Williams, she's former exec at Lucasfilm, said that she wants

02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.160
it to be fun to play, but also to be educational.

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:05.920
And she one of her quotes is, and if you and if through while having fun, they're able

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:09.200
to say, hey, I didn't know this about X, Y, Z, then we have also done our job.

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:17.200
Um, she's kind of, you know, wanting this to show a lot more of an honest view of how

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:18.400
politics work.

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:26.080
I mean, it's very much just like old courtly drama, you know, where this person moves against

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:29.840
this person and this person with power moves this way and you make these alliances and

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:32.160
you do this thing, except, of course, very modern.

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.800
You know, she said she wants it to give more information than Schoolhouse Rock.

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.960
It's chess on a different board.

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:43.040
It is, yeah, it's it's really.

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:50.400
The only thing that I can really liken the world of politics to, excuse me, my nose is

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.000
itching as a dumpster on fire in the ocean.

02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:59.440
No, it's like when you watch, um,

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:07.200
I was trying to think, kind of like watching Game of Thrones, I think, when you're watching

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:12.240
how the families sort of move against each other and interact and how you sway opinion

02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:13.840
to get alliances with one or the other.

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:18.480
I mean, in this case, if you're trying to sway someone's opinion, you go to a charity

02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.280
dinner, you donate to so-and-so's cause, even if you don't believe in it, you want so-and-so

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.040
to be on your side because you want them to think that you think the same way they do.

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:31.680
Um, it goes also into the less savory side of politics.

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:41.440
Um, by like, you can do attack ads, you can do, uh, uh, you know, social media manipulation.

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:50.240
Um, you can, I mean, they've even got people, uh, who worked, uh, in campaigns working on

02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:50.800
this game.

02:07:51.440 --> 02:08:01.120
Um, it's, it's absolutely, you know, going to be completely, I think, a candid and honest

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.080
look at it, but still supposed to be something that you're, you're supposed to have fun with.

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:11.600
All I have to say about the wide world of politics is remember my ex, the politician?

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:16.560
That is all I'm going to say about that.

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.640
That was a very eye-opening experience.

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:22.960
Thankfully, he, even though apparently he got a lot of votes, uh, he did not end up

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.400
holding public office.

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:28.960
And, uh, last I heard still hasn't, although honestly, I haven't heard a lot in a long

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.160
time, but, uh, the world's a better place for it.

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:33.840
Sorry to be shady, but also not sorry.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.760
I'm not sorry.

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:37.520
I'm not either.

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:40.400
I'm just supposed to be nice on, on the show.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.720
And I say this as a weird person.

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:46.960
He's such a weird guy.

02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.140
Yeah.

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:54.880
Well, that's, you know, I embrace my weird and he was completely strange to me.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.160
That's what happens when you, uh, you know what, I'm not going to get into it.

02:08:58.160 --> 02:08:58.880
I'm not going to get into it.

02:08:58.880 --> 02:08:59.760
I'm not going to get into it.

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.840
I'm a better, I am a better person.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.280
All right, let's move on.

02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:08.560
Speaking of Loki, why don't you be a better person with this next story?

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:18.320
Uh, I don't know if I could be the better person, but so Konami has decided to delay

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:27.440
E-Football 2022 version one to next year, probably because there's a lot of updates

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:30.240
and fixes they're going to have to do to even get to version one.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:32.640
And so that's just an inevitability of them.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.880
But yes, they have pushed it back to spring of 2022.

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:40.000
I just say, don't even bother at this point.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:46.480
It's just, it's trash, but yeah, they're, they're pushing it back.

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:49.200
Even though they already like, wasn't, they released it and stuff.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:10:01.520
So yeah, and I go along with that, um, they are, you may remember because, um, we had

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:08.480
brought it up in the story, they were so bold to pre-order the premium player pack, which

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:11.920
was paid DLC for that premium game.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.160
And yeah, they're refunding that for folks because, um, you know, their game is jank

02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:18.720
and broken.

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.280
So I apologize for the awkward silence, but I literally have nothing.

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:28.800
Congratulations, Konami.

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:32.080
You've managed to successfully pee and poo the bed.

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.360
Like, I don't, I don't know what to say.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:39.840
What do you say to some company that is such a colossal fucking mess?

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.200
Like, what do you say?

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.080
What do you say when you walk in the room and just, it's just, it's not even a room.

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:53.200
You've literally done that silent hill thing where you go through the hole and like, it

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:56.480
was, it used to be a room, but now it's murder.

02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.840
Like, I don't, what, what do you say?

02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:03.760
There's nothing.

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.560
And they have like the last thing that they had that was good was like pro Evo soccer.

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:13.280
And then they're like, Hey, wait, hold on, hold on.

02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.600
There's still an opportunity for us to screw this up.

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.600
And you know what?

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:25.360
They had, they took, it took some gusto, but they managed to pull that mess up in 2021.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:26.000
They did it.

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.560
So congrats, Konami.

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:33.120
Uh, dark Tetsuya chat says it's that meme from community.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.280
He walks in with a pizza and everything's on fire.

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:36.560
At least that guy had pizza.

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.360
That's a fair point.

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.720
Is, is, is there a playable game here?

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:43.760
Nope.

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:45.200
At least that guy had pizza.

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.440
Uh, as Joe and her mat says, just play that Bob Saget clip from dumb and dumber.

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.480
There's shit everywhere.

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:55.520
How about the Bob Saget directed movie dirty work, starring the late Norm McDonald rest

02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:01.360
in peace where the CA everybody, you have to know the scene where the guys look, there's

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:03.280
a dead hooker in that trunk over there.

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.320
Oh, Oh my gosh.

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.600
Another dead hooker.

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:10.320
Like it's, it's like really a tasteless scene and everything, but it's really funny.

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:16.480
Uh, if you have a dirty mind and it's that, that, that is a little more appropriate to

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.800
what Konami is going through right now.

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:21.520
Like, I just, I, I don't know what to say.

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:27.840
Um, Mike Defton chat says PT was foreshadowing of Konami state.

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.840
Now I know why Konami shut it down.

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:32.720
Now Bobby Black Wolf points out their gambling side isn't a mess.

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:33.600
It makes money.

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:34.720
Well, you know, what's interesting.

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:40.480
And maybe this goes back to the old division of, um, Konami, the arcade publisher and case

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:40.720
set.

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.880
What used to be that Konami, you know, computer entertainment, I guess technically still is

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.320
except they closed all the U S offices.

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.920
I don't even know how to sort that mess anymore.

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:55.040
My point is arcade hardware, gambling machines, things like that.

02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:55.600
Pachinko.

02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.280
Those are all fine.

02:12:58.560 --> 02:12:59.920
It's the software division.

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.040
That's a fucking nightmare.

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.760
Now, yes, uh, y'all brought up the Castlevania thing, but again, I said that really, that

02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:07.200
kind of wasn't Konami.

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.600
That kind of wasn't, it actually wasn't Konami.

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:10.880
It was their, it was their games.

02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:14.240
It was their, it was their old shit, but somebody did it for them.

02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:19.280
And honestly, after hearing about this football game, I think we should all be thankful someone

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:24.400
else did it for them because believe me, Konami would have found a way to pee and poo that

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.240
Castlevania collection if they'd done it themselves.

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:35.440
Uh, Tigerclaw in chat says, I still can't get over the fact two of the channels here

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:38.320
are named after the company that used to make arcade games.

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:43.440
Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, I think talking about, they were talking about something else, uh, with

02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:44.640
Valley Sports and all that stuff.

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:51.040
Um, I, it is funny that the name of our show comes from a Konami namesake, but it is, it

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:54.160
is quite literally the Konami of a different era, literally.

02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:57.840
And we'll always keep DDR near and dear in our hearts.

02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.080
And like I said, honestly, arcade division's fine.

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.360
Like new DDR mixes.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.080
Cool.

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:03.360
Uh, new 2DXs.

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:03.680
Yeah.

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.400
You know, all that stuff.

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:04.800
That's fine.

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:08.240
I don't got, I don't got no complaints about that, except I just got old.

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.360
I'm a Bamani boomer now as we talked about on a previous episode of OLR, but, um, that's

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.000
all cool.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.040
I don't got a problem with that.

02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:22.480
Anyway, one more story for you guys and Loki kind of referenced this already.

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:23.040
Thanks, Loki.

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:27.760
You know, but I understand it's in the release dates, but, um, Hey, look, Skyrim.

02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:35.120
Is coming out once again, it is the anniversary edition and it's kind of all over the place.

02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:35.620
Okay.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:36.960
So here's the deal.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:38.720
God damn it.

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:42.080
The story won't open because it thinks I'm using an ad blocker on this site.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.600
Um, there are different price levels for this, uh, uh, game that's coming out.

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.760
There's going to be $49.99 edition.

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.600
And I think that's the new one, or it's going to be $19.99.

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:57.200
If you want to just upgrade, I guess your existing edition.

02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:01.680
But then I also heard one of them is coming out on game pass somehow.

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.040
Because Skyrim is there, but it's like not the newest one, even though Microsoft owns

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.120
Bethesda now, like this newest one is not coming out right away or something.

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:11.600
I don't know.

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:14.880
It seems like a disaster, uh, of different pricing.

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:15.360
It's confused.

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:18.800
I shouldn't say disaster because, you know, Skyrim is a good game, but it's confusing

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:19.680
all these different tiers.

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:26.080
And it's confusing why Skyrim is getting released again, but it's, you know, the 10 year collection

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:32.080
and I get it from the perspective of, okay, they have to make it even better for the Xbox

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.520
series and for PlayStation five, but it's like, okay, they already kind of redid it

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.680
for Xbox one X and you can play that version on game and it looks fine.

02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:42.320
It looks great.

02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:43.760
It looks better than fine.

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:49.120
Um, so I guess what now you get ray tracing and extra sparkles and things like that.

02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:49.840
Cool.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:55.600
Um, but I don't, I don't know if it's really necessary to drop money to get this game all

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.320
over again.

02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:00.160
Um, but I guess Bethesda is hoping many of you will think differently.

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:02.880
Anything you want to add to that Loki?

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.320
Cause I know you're a Skyrim fan.

02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:11.520
Um, it's, it's a lot of it is just these, they keep trying to push that, uh, the creator

02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:12.720
club stuff really.

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:16.000
And so there's like a lot of pieces from that, but it's, it's all mods.

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:17.680
Some of it's kind of cool.

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:22.800
I mean, they've got like fishing and stuff in there now and, um, different armor sets.

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.320
Like if you're a fan of the other elder scrolls games, there's armor sets from those.

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:28.960
Um, is it 1999?

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:29.200
Cool.

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:30.480
Because that's the cost to upgrade.

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:32.960
Probably.

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.640
I mean, there's a lot of content in there.

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:35.280
I just don't know.

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.680
I'll just wait for the go on sale there.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.400
At the very least, they're giving you some stuff for free though.

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:43.760
So even if you don't upgrade and you already have a special edition, which probably most

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:46.320
of you did, cause they also updated that for free.

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:54.000
Um, then you get like, there's three big pieces of DLC kind of there being thrown in there.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.440
So I'll wait, it'll hit game pass eventually.

02:16:57.440 --> 02:16:58.800
It will hit game as eventually.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:00.400
It has to, I'll wait for that.

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:01.280
I mean, yeah.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.960
I mean, it's definitely gonna hit game pass eventually and, and see sales.

02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:07.680
I mean, that's just always they're cheap, so just wait.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:09.120
All right.

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.200
But don't wait for this segment.

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.400
It's the listener round table where we're going to take your calls.

02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:19.600
If you'd like to call us over at vognetwork.com slash discord, just hop into the green room

02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:24.960
and we might take a call or two, but we also want to take a look inside our mailbag, which

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:27.440
is at participate at orangelandtrader.com.

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:31.920
Something that was brought to my attention though, um, by a listener in our discord today

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.800
over at vognetwork.com slash discord, because, you know, we chat with you all throughout

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.360
the week, um, is that somebody tried to send an email through the website and it didn't

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:40.080
work.

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.080
Um, I have to confess the website is old and it's broken.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:49.360
And the only reason it exists right now is because it powers this show, uh, and the feed,

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:51.520
uh, that is still on iTunes.

02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:57.760
And I am scared as hell to change some of that because, um, obviously I don't want,

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.240
I don't want to lose the podcast feed that we have and you, cause we have like, we're

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:06.560
probably the, I don't, is there an older show on iTunes?

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.240
I don't, we've been, we've been on iTunes since day one.

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.160
I don't know if there's any other current running show that was there on day one.

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.840
Like, I'm not trying to toot our horn too much toot toot, but like there's certain,

02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:23.360
yeah, Guinness, there's certain types of prestige you don't want to lose.

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.160
And that's one of them.

02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:31.680
So, um, my point is the website has been updated in like 15 years and Hey, update the website,

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:33.120
just don't touch the feed links.

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.040
And that, that might be the ultimate solution.

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.120
And you know, Jason and I talked about it a long time ago.

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:38.320
We just never got around to it.

02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:39.840
And I do want to be clear.

02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:44.080
Somebody was very kind, a listener named Deke Mann and I'm sure if he still listens to the

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.240
show, somebody was very kind in doing that website for us 15 years ago and did it out

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:49.280
of the goodness of his heart.

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:50.480
And I just want to say thank you.

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:51.840
I can never thank you enough for that.

02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.400
I can't thank Jason enough for the multiple favors around on Facebook.

02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:57.520
I see him on Facebook.

02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:57.680
Yeah.

02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:58.880
The social media and all that stuff.

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.760
I still see deep, but I don't, you know, people come and come and go from the show.

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:04.480
I, and I appreciate both those guys immensely.

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:08.960
But the reality is he did it 15 years ago, but a lot's changed.

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:12.400
So yes, a new website is something that we really should work on.

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:18.000
So anyway, my point is if you try to send an email through the website, don't, uh, just

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.360
use your email client, participate at orange lounge, rated.com.

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:25.200
However, I can see why people would think that.

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:26.720
Why not just go to a website, clicking it.

02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:30.400
So I have to figure out how to update that to give a, uh, heads up or something like

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:30.720
that.

02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:33.600
It should just be a mail to link.

02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:40.400
Um, Bobby black, Bobby black Wolf says, uh, gamertag radio was there day one respectfully.

02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.320
And of course I, I re I realized they also have been running a very long time.

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.440
They've done more episodes.

02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:48.160
I have nothing but respect for Danny and the work that he does.

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:54.320
I thought he came out after iTunes launched because that was what inspired him to go the

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:55.360
direction from what he was.

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:58.000
He was doing like a fantasy star thing before I could be wrong.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:04.400
And if I am, I am sorry, but, um, and I'm sure, I'm sure there are also non video game

02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:06.320
podcasts that have been there since day one.

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:12.320
Um, but, um, not many that's for sure.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.640
So, all right.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:21.120
Anyway, I, but I don't, I don't think it was very long after, um, some of the day one podcasts.

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:26.960
There was the one with the dudes in Cleveland, but they kind of faded, although they like

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.640
we'll do one show a year or something like that.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:34.320
And again, please do not hear any of this as disrespect because it takes a lot of work

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.000
to do a show for one year.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.840
And I have nothing but respect for the folks that do that.

02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:44.560
But at the same time, we're, yes, we've been doing this for 19 years and we're going to

02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:45.760
kind of toot that a little bit.

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:46.960
We're very proud of it.

02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:48.000
You know, it takes it.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:48.240
Yes.

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.080
It's taken a lot of dedication to go that long.

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.800
So to do Bobby says I showed up a month after iTunes.

02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:56.560
I was month one, but not day one.

02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:00.640
That still puts you in the old folks home, Bobby, as far as I'm concerned.

02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:03.920
So it will be interesting to see what happens.

02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.160
Should we ever decide to call it quits?

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.320
Who's still going at that time?

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:12.080
And, um, I, cause I don't know.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:18.480
I, I'm, I'm very confident we are the longest running podcast about video games or internet

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:21.040
show, especially, especially when you combine all that together.

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:22.640
I don't know who's second place.

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:24.720
Y'all can fight about that.

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:26.080
I don't know.

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:27.440
All right.

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:29.120
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:33.360
Uh, I was going to get to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com.

02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:36.160
Yes, there is one.

02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:36.660
Yay.

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:44.160
Um, I don't have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say Ronnie with Microsoft announcing

02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.640
their avatars and virtual universe for teams.

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:49.520
Do you think PlayStation home was ahead of its time?

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:54.640
If Sony had stuck it out to this point, do you think there would have been opportunities

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:58.240
for them to utilize the service professionally during COVID?

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:03.040
Also, do you think AR tech missed a huge opportunity to advance during COVID?

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:04.320
I've been, uh, thanks.

02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.960
I've been listening since life 365 days.

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:07.680
Wow.

02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:09.680
This is my first time in mailbag.

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:11.200
Wow.

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.200
Well, hi Ronnie.

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:13.680
Well, hi.

02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:15.760
We love a long time listener.

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:16.880
First time caller.

02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:17.200
Wow.

02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:18.160
That is a long time.

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:21.360
The live is five days that predates iTunes.

02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:21.840
I think.

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:24.160
Yeah, no, it absolutely does.

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:26.400
Cause that's where we started there.

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:30.720
No, I know, but I'm trying to think where, remember there was about a year that we were

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:33.440
doing a podcast and a live show and then we combined.

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:33.940
Right.

02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:36.800
I, we have the to go edition.

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:39.600
I think we were still on life 365 at that time.

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.080
But is this then when we were doing to go or was it when we were just doing orange

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:46.240
lounge radio and it's earlier iteration?

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.200
Probably both.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.440
But anyway, I, I, cause, uh, all games didn't happen.

02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.520
There was only one show when all games happen.

02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:58.800
There was no more to go edition.

02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.160
So it had to be, it had to be.

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:00.660
Yeah.

02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:02.400
Yeah.

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:02.720
Yeah.

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:04.240
So the questions anyway.

02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:04.740
Yes.

02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.640
Um, so yes.

02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:08.800
Going back to the question about, oh yes.

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:10.480
Was a PlayStation home ahead of its time?

02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.720
Yes and no.

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:18.640
Um, I think there were features of home that were underutilized and undersold.

02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:22.480
And then, and instead we got promises that never came to real fruition.

02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:28.400
Um, such as like that virtual display case of the various achievements that you got.

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:33.040
You could get a shirt here and there in PlayStation home, but they never really

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:38.000
pushed that forward in the way that I think people really wanted to see.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.360
But I think PlayStation, I think a lot of people would be into PlayStation home,

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.440
that type of thing, if it existed now.

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:47.520
And, um, I, I, you know, there's always been those rumors about, you know, oh, they're

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:51.600
going to do, uh, PlayStation is going to do their knockoff of VR chat and it's going to

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.920
be PlayStation home and PlayStation VR.

02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:55.520
Um, I think that's nice.

02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:58.640
I, I don't know if that would actually happen or not.

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:02.240
Um, my other big bitch about PlayStation home was that they should have let us have

02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:05.680
more control over the clubhouses, but I think they were really paranoid about

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:09.040
copyright theft and things like that, but we could have done so much more with that

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.920
oil, our clubhouse.

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:11.920
So we've been giving a little more freedom.

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:15.120
Um, but there were, there were elements of it that were ahead of its time.

02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:15.440
Yes.

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:19.520
And I think it would be a very interesting player if it was still around today.

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.240
Absolutely.

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:26.800
So thank you, Bobby, with the timeline, you came to all games in early 2006.

02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.520
iTunes was June of 2005.

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:34.080
There was like a year period in there where everything happened very fast.

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.520
And there was a lot that happened really fast.

02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.760
There was the launch of to go.

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.000
There was the launch of iTunes, which then shot up our listenership like crazy.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.880
As far as podcasting goes, there was then live 365 up to all the rates.

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.400
So then we moved to all games.

02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:52.800
But before that was the syndication on all games.

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.480
There was like a three or four month period where like they were playing our

02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:59.440
show, but it was just a rerun, uh, kind of like DDR free grade.

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:00.160
It was doing back then.

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.720
There's just, there was a lot that happened in like a year, 18 month period

02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:07.600
very quickly, um, that this all kind of falls into.

02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:10.080
Anyway, thanks for the walk down memory lane.

02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:11.120
And thank you for the email.

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:15.360
Um, Quest Buster says the Japanese PlayStation Home was really nice versus

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:16.240
the one in the States.

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.480
They gave away so much free stuff.

02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:19.040
Yeah, I think.

02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:22.080
I think you get out what you put into it.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.800
And I think if Sony had put a little more into PlayStation Home, they would

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:29.280
have really seen the rewards they that year that they did the virtual E3 in

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:34.320
PlayStation Home was actually kind of interesting, uh, and kind of neat.

02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.160
And it's a real, but I bet very few people actually experienced that because

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:41.440
there was just a lot of like, LOL PlayStation Home.

02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:43.680
Remember we used to have that listener.

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.800
Definitely a former listener.

02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.240
I think unfortunately he rage quit.

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.840
We said something he didn't agree with or something.

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:49.440
And, um, it happens.

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.360
Uh, he was like super into PlayStation Home and would call into the show and

02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:56.000
talk about like all these things that PlayStation Home was doing.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.680
And we, he were the guy and went to his PlayStation Home clubhouse and we were

02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:04.000
actually kind of like, wow, you really can do a lot of cool shit in this game.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.240
Like he had a really cool little thing laid out and everything.

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:09.280
And yeah, there was a lot you could do a PlayStation Home that just, I don't

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:15.440
think really broke through into the masses, like how to really explain that,

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.920
you know, and I think that's a big part of it as well.

02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:21.680
Um, it's interesting though, if I remember the email, right.

02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:26.720
Kind of brought up Microsoft teams and maybe Microsoft entering this space.

02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:33.120
Um, I mean, it would be interesting, but it, since they're bringing it up in

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:36.640
teams, I think a lot of that has to do with the pandemic.

02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:41.200
And maybe when we talk about PlayStation Home, we talk about what could that have

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.240
looked like if that was around when the pandemic started, that could have been

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:46.160
a very interesting sort of thing.

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:50.000
Um, but I feel like Microsoft's responses is nothing to do with gaming in which

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.840
you see in teams, but more a response to the pandemic and the reality of the

02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.640
hybrid office model, if not completely work from home model that many people

02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.320
are going to in the future.

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:04.800
Um, there's just, it's, it's instead of you work in the office or you work

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.080
at home, there's going to be a lot of people in a middle category very soon,

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:08.960
a hybrid model.

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:13.680
Um, and I think this like Microsoft teams, uh, changes there may is, is in

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:15.680
response to that, what it can do for gaming.

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:16.960
I don't know.

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.960
Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says, uh, Microsoft is already doing it.

02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.480
It's called alt space VR.

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:29.440
It's I, I forgot about that Zen monkey until you mentioned it.

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:31.600
So Microsoft isn't really pushing it.

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.520
And so it's really about, you know, if Microsoft wants something like that

02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.120
to be for gaming, they're going to really have to put that oomph behind it

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:40.720
that makes gamers want to check it out.

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:44.960
Unfortunately, a lot of experimental Microsoft products that really should

02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.360
have stuck around also go away.

02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.360
Uh, so this isn't something unique to Sony.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.320
So let's have, let's have our weekly complaint.

02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:54.640
Where's one versus 100.

02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:55.520
That was awesome.

02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:57.760
Where's Microsoft game room.

02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:01.680
As far as selling me an emulator goes, that was probably one of the best they

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:03.760
ever did was Microsoft game room.

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:08.320
Like, so Microsoft isn't unique to walking away from these things that

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.320
should have been better fully realized.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:13.920
But alas, that is the game industry we live in sometimes.

02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:16.400
And the last, that was the only email we got, but thank you.

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:17.120
Longtime listener.

02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:20.720
First time caller Ronnie for the email participate at orange launch,

02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:21.280
rated.com.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:26.560
If you want to send us an email for a future week, uh, and not the website.

02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:29.120
I don't see anybody in the green room.

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:30.400
I'll give it to just another moment.

02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.360
If you have any questions for us, uh, you can shout them out in our, um, uh,

02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:37.920
Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:40.640
In the meantime, I want to check in with Loki and see if there's

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:41.680
any last minute stories.

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:47.280
Uh, the only thing I had is that apparently, uh, it looks like fail

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:53.440
overflow, the famous, um, cracking and hacking group has shown that they

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:56.240
can decrypt the PlayStation five firmware files.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:58.160
Oh, interesting.

02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:01.280
So what does that ultimately mean?

02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:03.920
Does that mean they're going to try to do a home brew injection on

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:04.640
PlayStation five?

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.480
Or is that like, that's not emulation.

02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.520
That's like home brew trying to run that stuff on PS five, right?

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:09.680
Yeah.

02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:15.600
And they also, there's another, um, another screenshot from a PlayStation

02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.640
actually showing debug settings enabled on the PlayStation five as well.

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.760
So, all right, we'll wait and see what happens.

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:26.960
All right.

02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.360
Well, I still do not see anyone in the green room, so I don't think we're

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.760
getting any calls tonight and that is okay.

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:34.160
Uh, and then I don't really see any direct questions.

02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:37.120
So, um, yeah, I think we, I think we kind of burned through all the news.

02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.400
We had some good stuff.

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.600
Uh, Oh, Garth the Wolf in chat brings up the Endwalker delay, which I guess

02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.800
I didn't really exist during the address during the show.

02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:47.600
I thought I would get to it during my game week, but Garth the Wolf says

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:50.320
Endwalker delay is a relief because now I will actually have time to

02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:52.720
complete my first relic weapon in Bozja.

02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:55.840
I don't even know if I'll get around to that, but I will get all my jobs to

02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:56.160
80.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.880
I might hit 80 tonight on my last job after the show.

02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:02.080
We'll see how, how long I have, uh, and if I have help.

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:06.400
Um, but, um, yeah, they delayed Endwalker by two weeks.

02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:09.520
It was supposed to come out in early access, I think November 23rd.

02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.680
And now it's pushed back to December 3rd.

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:14.640
And, uh, there was a big live letter that they did on Friday.

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:17.440
And, um, you know, they were talking about this and a lot of the other

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:18.480
changes of the game.

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:23.440
And, uh, Yoshi P, the producer director of Final Fantasy 14 looked so upset.

02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:25.120
He looked like he was going to cry.

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:28.880
I wanted to hug him because it's not a big deal.

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.080
It's two weeks, whatever.

02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:34.640
Do you, do you really, you guys have to remember Yoshi P is not only working

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:39.840
on Final Fantasy 14, the greatest turnaround in video game history.

02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:41.440
I would put it above Diablo 3.

02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:42.400
I really would.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:45.600
Final Fantasy 14 is the greatest turnaround in gaming history.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:48.160
Yoshi P is to credit for that.

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:51.680
And it's hardworking team, but there is a leader of that team and it's Yoshi P.

02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:57.440
In addition to Final Fantasy 14, he is also working on Final Fantasy 16.

02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:00.160
That man is fucking busy.

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:07.920
And to see him literally pour his heart out for all of us because QA issues and wanting

02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:12.560
to make sure the game isn't fucked when it releases caused a two week delay.

02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:14.160
Like I just, I wanted to hug him.

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:18.000
I felt so bad, but you know, and most people were understanding.

02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:23.520
Probably 90%, you know, even higher were understanding, but of course there's going

02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:26.960
to be those people that are like, I took the day off work and I'm very upset because I

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.320
can't get my PTO rearranged.

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:31.200
You guys are very upset to do this at the last minute is so rude.

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:38.080
Hey, hey, put your clown dress on tonight because you're the one that took time off

02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:38.800
for an MMO.

02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:43.200
And MMO launches are almost always bort.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.480
And I'm not saying this to everyone who took time off for an MMO, because some people are

02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:50.320
saying, oh, that sucks.

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.000
Guess I'll do something else.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.360
That is the correct response.

02:31:54.880 --> 02:32:00.080
But for the people that decide to tweet Yoshi P when he's literally crying on camera because

02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:04.480
he has to delay his game, that I, what about me?

02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:09.680
Shut the fuck up.

02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:10.960
All right.

02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:17.440
Uh, Mike Defton chat says, Yoshi P is a godsend and I don't even play Final Fantasy 14.

02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:20.640
Garth the Wolf in chat says, Yoshi P cried while apologizing.

02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:21.840
He shouldn't have to feel that way.

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:23.600
He's amazing and works so hard.

02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:27.600
How many times has Yoshi P put his heart on his fucking sleeve this year when we don't

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:28.240
deserve it?

02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:33.920
Remember that whole thing, uh, a fan fest when he was talking about Soken and everything

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:35.680
that Soken was going through medically.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:41.440
And like, wait, gaming does not deserve Yoshi P.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.320
And if you hurt that man's feelings, I will beat you up.

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:49.120
He is a, he's a perfect cinnamon roll.

02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:54.800
I, I, I need to say for the purposes of Twitch, uh, rules and things I metaphorically, I will

02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:55.300
beat you up.

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:59.120
I don't mean that literally for the purposes of Twitch things.

02:32:59.120 --> 02:32:59.600
Yes.

02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:01.840
I will beat you up with, with words.

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:03.280
Yoshi P is precious.

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:05.840
He is a gift in this gaming industry.

02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:10.240
He is not here for your bullshit.

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:11.360
And I will see to that.

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:17.520
Comments in chat, DJ Rama S, are gamers entitled?

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:17.840
Yes.

02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:20.640
Was that the website that Bobby had?

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:22.240
What was the website that Bobby had?

02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.080
Are gamers mad?

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:27.440
Are gamers, do gamers hate, gamers hate everything.

02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:27.760
That's it.

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:28.960
Gamers hate everything.com.

02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:31.120
That, that was it.

02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:32.800
It took me a minute.

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.600
My old brain.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:35.440
Thank you, Bobby.

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:36.880
Gamers hate everything.com.

02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:37.360
What?

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.960
You are not old gamer.

02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:40.400
Your game is not old.

02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:44.320
Can I, gamers are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:46.240
Gamers are not, I forbid it.

02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:46.960
What, you know what?

02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:53.280
If I'm gonna, if I'm gonna wield that 19 year thing around the room and this whole like

02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:58.000
where you know what, I'm going to decree that you are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.

02:33:58.880 --> 02:33:59.440
Period.

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:01.840
You're not a gamer.

02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.600
If you hate Yoshi P, you're not a gamer.

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:05.200
You're not.

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.760
I take, we take it away from you.

02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:09.040
What do you say chat?

02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:13.200
We, we strip away the gamer rights of those that hate Yoshi P.

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:14.880
Down with that.

02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:15.520
How dare you?

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:17.120
All right.

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:19.360
Anyway, uh oh.

02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.440
I guess the site is currently broken.

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:24.000
Gamer, gamers took out gamers hate everything.com.

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:25.840
Good lord.

02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.720
Garth the Wolf would like to point out Final Fantasy 14 has the best stories to tell.

02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:32.640
The lead writer of the game is a woman.

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:33.040
Yes.

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.600
Uh, who also wrote shadow ringers, which was incredible.

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.840
And the, the, the critically acclaimed MMO.

02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:38.560
She's fabulous.

02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:40.100
All right.

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:41.120
Anyway.

02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:42.560
Okay.

02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.440
I've said enough.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:43.680
Yeah.

02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:44.160
I'm sorry.

02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:44.560
I'm sorry.

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.160
I had some thoughts and some feelings and some opinions and I had to express them.

02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:50.160
You were entitled to that, Rob.

02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.320
No one's saying no for the record.

02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.160
You're joining me in this whole Yoshi.

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:54.880
You're not allowed.

02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:57.280
If you hate Yoshi P, I will take your, you're not a gamer.

02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:58.800
You, that title is taken away, right?

02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:01.760
You're going to help me enforce this rule, right?

02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:03.680
Yeah, Rob.

02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:03.920
Sure.

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:05.760
All right.

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:07.280
What'd you want to say?

02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:10.640
Oh, for the record, I didn't get to have a pink drink today.

02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:13.040
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.600
I had a beige drink instead.

02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:16.640
Oh, you poor thing.

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:19.040
I had a green tea.

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:21.040
My heart was broken, Rob.

02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:22.880
Were they out of pink drink?

02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:23.940
They were.

02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:30.580
Um, so I had my, my fallback, which was my ice chai latte with one pump of the apple syrup.

02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:31.540
Oh, good times.

02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:32.020
Good times.

02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:33.060
All right.

02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:33.460
Delicious.

02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:34.180
And I'm a genius.

02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:35.140
All right.

02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:38.900
Uh, Garth the Wolf in chat says chestnut praline latte is out.

02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:40.580
Yeah, that's a really good, that's a really good.

02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:42.340
I wish, wish I could get one soon.

02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:42.740
All right.

02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:45.460
Um, anyway, uh, let's, let's wrap up.

02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:49.380
Um, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight and listening to it and listening

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:53.300
to us make decrees and rules and bitch and complain.

02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:55.140
This is our access.

02:35:55.140 --> 02:35:57.780
Thank you for coming to our group therapy tonight.

02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:00.740
We appreciate something.

02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:05.940
Uh, that's, that's how the shows lasted 19 years.

02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.700
It's basically therapy.

02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:09.940
Uh, in a way it is sometimes.

02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:12.820
Uh, anyway, thank you guys for being here and thank you for tuning in.

02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:16.100
Whether you're like Ronnie and had been listening on the podcast feed for years and years and

02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:17.300
years and years and years.

02:36:17.300 --> 02:36:18.260
Thank you so much for that.

02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:23.060
If you've been listening live here at twitch.tv, uh, thank you very much for that as well.

02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:23.860
Appreciate you guys.

02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:25.700
However, you choose to listen to the show.

02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:28.660
If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:31.220
Help us spread the word, a social media retweet.

02:36:31.220 --> 02:36:33.620
Uh, those types of things go a long way as well.

02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.660
Hosts on Twitch.

02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.420
That whole system is kind of weird right now, but we'll take it.

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:40.100
If you want to host us on Twitch, please do.

02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:45.300
For, for the record on that point, I'm going to say better TV house has an option for you

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:48.660
to add host channel when you are in somebody else's channel.

02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:52.340
Oh, it is very useful.

02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:56.260
If you're using better TTV and you don't see that it is an option that you can turn on

02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:57.060
in your settings.

02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:00.660
Is better TTV like an add on somebody wrote to fix all the problems with TTV.

02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:06.500
Um, better TTV is actually for more icons than the standard, uh, ones that you get.

02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:09.380
I was using it for my no bill icon for a long time.

02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:13.380
And, uh, bourbon put up the no fang that I made.

02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:15.300
Interesting.

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:16.020
I don't know about that.

02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:16.900
Yeah.

02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:19.620
I'll, I'll, I'll link you the stuff after I do my thing tonight.

02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:23.140
I know about the pronouns add on for, but that's about the only

02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:28.020
which doesn't work right in Safari.

02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:32.420
Although a lot of those things run through tamper monkey, but that I digress.

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:33.940
Interesting.

02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:35.140
Okay.

02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:38.100
Um, but anyway, uh, thank you very much for your support.

02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:42.260
If you feel so inclined, you can also visit the store, vog network.com slash shop, uh,

02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:44.900
pick up an OLR t-shirt just in time for the holidays.

02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:48.740
Say hello to a loved one with a Bobby black Wolf mug, which you can pick up at vog network.com

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.740
slash shop or a cool little vog network, logo, uh, anything.

02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:55.540
Um, maybe we should add a couple items before the holidays.

02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:55.940
We'll see.

02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:56.580
We'll see.

02:37:56.580 --> 02:38:00.580
Uh, maybe if you're good, uh, check that out at vog network.com slash shop.

02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:03.540
And, uh, again, thank you so much for your support of the show.

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.980
It really does mean the world.

02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:07.220
Uh, we'll be back next week to do it all again.

02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:08.660
Before we say good night, good night.

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:11.380
We want to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:13.540
So let me go to dark soccer at first.

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:15.780
I'll say, uh, your final thought first, before you head out.

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.340
My stomach hurts a lot because I ate too much.

02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:22.020
I had a taco and I had a donut and the donuts were cheap and half price over at Safeway.

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:29.140
And I made a big mistake, choices, choices, but you got to eat a taco and a donut today

02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:30.660
in a way pretty cool.

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:33.620
Remember no booping without consent.

02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:34.420
All right.

02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:35.300
Thank you to our soccer.

02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:39.700
And, uh, we look forward to the boops on your stream and just a little later for live listeners.

02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:40.180
So thanks.

02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:40.680
Have a good one.

02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:41.860
All right.

02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:43.860
And Loki, how about your final thought?

02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:52.420
Uh, my final thought is if you haven't already go subscribe to my YouTube channel, uh, username

02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:55.780
Loki O R and check out my new video.

02:38:56.340 --> 02:39:00.500
I've watched that, uh, time-lapse video that I filmed in there several times.

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.340
It syncs up so well to the music.

02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:03.140
I love it.

02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:04.020
Go check it out.

02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:05.220
I made in Django city.

02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:06.260
All right.

02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:08.500
You know what you need to add to your channel though?

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:13.060
If you want to try to get more people, add some of your funny ass rants on things like

02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:13.780
to your channel.

02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:18.580
I think, I think you'd get a lot of just other, other audience that comes in non-Minecraft

02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:18.820
people.

02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:21.460
You got to reach the non-Minecraft crowd somehow, but yes.

02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:22.820
All right.

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:23.540
Uh, check it out.

02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:25.780
I, of course I encourage all of our folks to check it out.

02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:29.220
Of course, of course you'll learn to love Minecraft with Loki.

02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:30.900
Uh, I guess I'll plug my channel too.

02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:32.660
I was very bad in broadcasting last week.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:34.020
I promise I have a good reason.

02:39:34.020 --> 02:39:36.740
I'm not going to talk about it right now, but I've just had a lot going on this last

02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:37.220
week.

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:41.060
Um, but I I'm going to really try to get back on the wagon next week because I was doing

02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.820
so good with my post-work streams.

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:46.260
So I'll plug myself at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:46.980
Oh, and Twitter.

02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:48.020
I fucking love Twitter.

02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:51.300
Just follow me on Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts, Mr Rob Roberts.

02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:53.220
Um, yeah, that's it.

02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:54.980
That's going to do it for tonight's show.

02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:55.380
Thank you.

02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:57.620
Um, we'll be back to do it again.

02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:00.900
I can't believe like it's November, 2021.

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:08.020
Like this time since we flipped to virtual has just flown by like this whole pandemic

02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:08.740
stuff.

02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.340
I get my booster next week.

02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:10.900
That's exciting.

02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:12.020
I got mine on Friday.

02:40:12.020 --> 02:40:12.580
Congrats.

02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:15.060
Did you get boosted with J and J or did you get something else?

02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:16.180
No, Moderna.

02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:17.540
I know you hate shots.

02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:18.820
So that does take a lot.

02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:20.020
I do hate shots.

02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:20.580
Well, congrats.

02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:21.300
Thank you for doing it.

02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:25.140
It's like literally felt nothing from it.

02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:30.180
My arm was very mildly sore the next day.

02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:30.900
Oh, you didn't get it.

02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:32.500
You didn't get any side effects from Moderna otherwise?

02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:32.820
That's good.

02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:34.340
Because I got no side effects.

02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:34.900
I am good.

02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:36.740
I'm getting tic-tac-toe with Moderna.

02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:40.740
So I'm getting a Moderna shot on, uh, Thursday, I think.

02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:41.140
No, no.

02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:41.940
Thursday's a holiday.

02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:43.620
So I think I might get it Tuesday.

02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:44.020
I don't know.

02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:45.860
I don't fucking know time anymore.

02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:47.620
So but I'm going to get tic-tac-toe.

02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:49.380
So I'll have Moderna, Moderna, Moderna.

02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:53.220
So because that is my love of Dolly Parton and the vaccine

02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:54.420
that she helped fund.

02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:56.180
It's like getting the Moderna vaccine.

02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:58.740
Get the vaccines.

02:40:58.740 --> 02:40:59.380
We're fine.

02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:01.300
You will be too.

02:41:01.300 --> 02:41:04.180
And yes, Bobby Blackwell says, follow the VOG Network

02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:04.980
Twitter as well.

02:41:04.980 --> 02:41:05.380
Of course.

02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:08.900
I just figured you already were at VOG Network.

02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:09.940
Yes, yes.

02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:10.820
All right.

02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:11.860
Tic-tac-toe Derna.

02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:12.100
Yes.

02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:14.020
And Garth says that's Moderna is the half dose.

02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:14.420
All right.

02:41:14.420 --> 02:41:15.620
It's not vaccine launch radio.

02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:16.260
It's Orange launch radio.

02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:16.740
No, I'm sorry.

02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:17.780
I didn't get Moderna.

02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:18.900
I got Pfizer.

02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:20.260
Oh, I confused myself.

02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:20.760
Liar.

02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:25.380
So I did get the Pfizer one and I felt nothing.

02:41:25.380 --> 02:41:27.380
But the point is you got the booster.

02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:27.860
I did.

02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:28.340
You did.

02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:28.660
All right.

02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:30.420
Awesome.

02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:33.220
Get vaccinated so we can have conventions again.

02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:34.340
So we can have tournaments again.

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:35.620
We can have arcades again.

02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:37.380
We've got to end this fucking pandemic.

02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:40.740
At least where you're if you're going to, if you're

02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:43.460
because I realize there are there is a very, very small

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:45.220
amount of people who literally can't get vaccinated

02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:46.980
because, like, you know, they were recently on a medication

02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:47.480
or something.

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:49.540
At least wear your masks.

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:52.180
Choose smart.

02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:52.580
That's it.

02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:53.540
I'll get off my soapbox.

02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:54.740
We're going to end this episode.

02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:56.660
We'll do another episode of Orange launch radio next week.

02:41:57.220 --> 02:41:58.820
Who knows what rants we have in store.

02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:00.740
We'll see what the gaming industry does to us over the

02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:01.540
next seven days.

02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:04.340
Listen to the Ubisoft employees.

02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:05.940
Fire Yves Guumont.

02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:07.380
That's not what they're saying, but that's what I'm saying.

02:42:07.380 --> 02:42:07.780
Good night.

02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:11.300
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:16.340
