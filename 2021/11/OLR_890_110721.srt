00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
This week, if you showed up and Bobby was an hour late or you showed up for Bobby and

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,960
got us instead, you probably forgot to set your clocks back or forgot that we did, hemispheres

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,480
and countries and the tyranny of clocks, something like that.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,340
For the podcast listeners, it's just another day ending in Y or G if you're Swedish.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,300
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you actual news.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,420
Things like a Squid Game like games, certainly needed social dynamic changes and plenty more

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,940
news starting right now on the show.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,260
Rera Gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:48,700
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
That's right.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,900
A brand new time zone tonight and we are back with episode number 890 for this November

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,540
the 7th of 2021.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,940
And on Twitch, I'm by myself right now.

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Why is that?

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,940
There we go.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
Hello.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,060
I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my incredible co-hosts.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,220
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,220
Hi.

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,260
But you know, we're not really in a different time zone.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
We're still Pacific time.

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Yeah.

24
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,340
I should have said a different time, not time zone.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,220
But you know, when you're trying to do camera changes with one hand and talking with your

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,220
mouth, it's a lot.

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,220
It's multitasking.

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,220
It's hard.

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,220
It's very hard.

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,420
I don't need to know what you're doing with one hand, Rob.

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,420
I got one hand in my pocket to quote an Alanis Morissette song, but that's all it's doing.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,360
Anyway, DarkSakura, I wanted to start off the show by saying to you happy N7 day.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,400
How did you, how did you spend your N7 day?

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,940
I was busy all day.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,740
We did, it was really actually kind of a half work day for me.

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,460
I had to, I had a sister meeting this morning and it went two hours instead of one hour,

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,340
longer than two hours actually.

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,540
Are you back to doing those in person or is it still virtual?

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:04,180
No, we tried and then we went right back to zooming it.

40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:11,740
And funny enough, I found that the thing I use for connecting my phone for, not for Twitch,

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,900
I use Twitch cam for that, but for discord works in zoom.

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:24,020
So I was able to, but for some reason, zoom doesn't like my headphones maybe because it's

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,440
hooked in through my microphone, maybe, but lots of house cleaning and I had to get some

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:41,100
groceries and, and yeah, just too busy today, but I but to celebrate, I did not play any

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,260
mass effect because I didn't have time and it still won't run on my Mac.

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,500
Well, that's a bummer, but yeah, that legendary edition, uh, I don't, I haven't touched it

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
myself in, since it really, like it came out, I didn't even beat mass effect one still.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,740
I think Alan did a play through of it, but I never did.

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,220
And uh, I was kind of waiting for them to finish patching it because they were still

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,780
putting out patches after the fact.

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,820
So, um, well, I still haven't done animal crossing either just because of how busy I've

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
been.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
So, Oh my gosh.

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,180
There's a lot of people playing that.

55
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,620
I haven't, I haven't gotten around to animal crossing yet either, but I know a lot of people

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,260
have been super enjoying that one.

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,620
Uh, I want to go to s two and a mat in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,400
night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby black will

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,100
show at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
That's VOG network.

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
And that's the shoe.

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
One hundred.

63
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,140
Matt says, I didn't realize it was N seven day until an hour ago.

64
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,740
Um, neither did I, well, not an hour ago, but it was a good chunk into the day until

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,260
I realized, I think I was on Twitter and then I realized, Oh yeah, it is.

66
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
It's November 7th.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,380
It's N seven day, but I wasn't expecting much this year.

68
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,340
Of course I should backtrack if you don't know what N seven day is, it's a tie into

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,700
the game series mass effect, which of course doc soccer and I fan boy and fangirl about,

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:03,220
uh, because, uh, it's an amazing series, um, and N seven refers to like, like the military

71
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,020
kind of special squad sort of thing that's in the game that shepherds apart.

72
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,380
They have like a seven levels of special ops and seven is the top designation.

73
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,600
Kind of like hell.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,340
So you're in the seventh circle of alien hell in a mass effect.

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
So yeah.

76
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,620
So this is always kind of a special day and usually they drop some mass effect news.

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,420
They actually did today, and I don't know if you saw it, dark soccer, but they did put

78
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
out a poster.

79
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,100
They put out a new poster for the new game and it doesn't say much, but it kind of hints

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,220
that like the geth are strongly involved, which if it's a game in shepherd's universe

81
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,460
would make sense.

82
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,540
Uh, but it, you know, there's like this interesting shadow of like a geth figure that the, you

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,940
know, a picture makes out.

84
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,660
So it's kinda, kinda interesting.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,860
But again, I saw that poster and I was like, looks great.

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,820
Too bad I won't play it till 2025.

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,920
Well, I would rather it take a while to come out and be good.

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
That is true.

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,600
We don't want them to rush it, but it does seem weird to like tease it.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,940
You know, I'm just like, okay, it's like, it's like hyping a Marvel movie that won't

91
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,380
be out for three years, you know, it's, but it is what it is.

92
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,740
I guess people do that now anyway.

93
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
All right.

94
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,740
I reckon.

95
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Also say hello.

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,980
Welcome back this week to Techmaster Loki.

97
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,700
Welcome back, Loki.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,060
I guess we'll have to wait and see what they come up with for that new game.

99
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
And goodbye, Loki.

100
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,060
It was nice.

101
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,820
Uh, well, it wasn't nice having you.

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Goodbye.

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
All right.

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Uh, anyway.

105
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Hey, dark soccer.

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Let's no, I'm just kidding.

107
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,820
I'm just kidding.

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
All right.

109
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
How was your Halloween?

110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Loki?

111
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Uh, it was fine.

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,820
It was pretty typical.

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Took the kids out.

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,700
I was reading and got some candy.

115
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,940
Um, it was pretty short this year, so yeah.

116
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Yeah.

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Well, that's good.

118
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,900
They ain't getting good candy though.

119
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Time.

120
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
No.

121
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,980
Why does, does dad go through the bag and pick out the ones he wants first?

122
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,340
Not really, but like, you know, like tootsie rolls and stuff.

123
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,220
So, uh, they didn't have any, so I had to buy my own.

124
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Like I don't even know.

125
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,060
It's not worth it at that point.

126
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,020
Uh, let's see.

127
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,940
Bobby black Wolfen chat says the kids got some candy.

128
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,540
Loki got lots of candy.

129
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Yes.

130
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,720
Three and a half pounds of candy.

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,820
Then the day after Halloween is when you go and you get all the on sale candy.

132
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,880
So yeah, that's how it works.

133
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
So yeah.

134
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,180
Um, okay.

135
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,080
What is the game playing behind you tonight?

136
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,340
I don't, I don't recognize it.

137
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,340
I don't know why, but like I was thinking about it today as I was kind of getting ready.

138
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,380
I'm like, well, what do I want to put in my background today?

139
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,740
And just for some reason, my brain being stupid, decided to shout out home improvement.

140
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,680
And I was like, I don't even know if there is a home improvement game, but apparently

141
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,760
there is, there is a home improvement game on the super Nintendo.

142
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,580
It's like home improvement search for tools or I remember it's search for something with

143
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,620
tools, but, um, it looks weird.

144
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,020
Believe it or not, they made a lot of bullshit games on the super Nintendo.

145
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,380
That's why, even though I wasn't sure if that's the case, I'm like, there's a good chance

146
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,540
that it's there.

147
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Yeah.

148
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,900
We hope we hold the super Nintendo in high regard and mostly with good reason, but that,

149
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,420
you know, every system has its clunkers, you know, and, and there you go the whole game,

150
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,580
you know, he is basically fighting with tools and it's great.

151
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,660
He has a nail gun.

152
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,180
Looks like he's using a saw the fight off dinosaurs or something.

153
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,860
So, um, I'm down for that.

154
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,840
I need to see that in the awful block.

155
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,260
My one little weird, quirky thing.

156
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,540
I know I've mentioned this on the show before, but it's been a while.

157
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Say it again.

158
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,420
My one little weird, quirky thing is that, um, I went to school with that kid's brother,

159
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,740
uh, the Jonathan Taylor Thomas, they used to live where I grew up, grew up and the kid's

160
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,420
brother was in my math class.

161
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,500
So yeah, it's just, it's, it's a small world, I guess, but yeah, I guess everybody's, you

162
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,780
know, got weird ties to someone famous like that.

163
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,680
But even I, you know, obviously I, we weren't like friends or anything, so I didn't really

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
keep in touch or whatever.

165
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,860
I had friends that were friends with him, but, um, I, uh, didn't really keep in touch.

166
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,100
Even I was wondering what the hell ever happened to that kid?

167
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,780
Like, cause you know, after home improvement, he kind of disappeared, right?

168
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,180
And then I guess they, they finally found him a few years ago, but yeah, it was funny.

169
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,300
He was here at this bar the whole time.

170
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
Oh, did you check under the rock?

171
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
All right.

172
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Anyway, uh, let's see.

173
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,340
Bobby Blackwell in chat says, I think home improvement has been on games done quick before.

174
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Oh, I'm sure.

175
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,300
As Jonah and Matt says, yeah, I remember the game now.

176
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,820
I remember renting it.

177
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,380
It's trash with 16 bit, Tim Allen, grunting sound effects.

178
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,380
Oh God.

179
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
That's the best part though.

180
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Like seriously.

181
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,500
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I bought the last super Nintendo game ever officially released

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,440
in North America and it's so bad.

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,380
It's Frogger, but it's a bad version of Frogger.

184
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Yikes.

185
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
That's every version of Frogger.

186
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,380
Except for the arcade.

187
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,620
Yeah, the original and Frogger two, three deep on the Commodore 64 was pretty good.

188
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,220
So anyway, okay, Loki, I have to ask you about this because you weren't here last week, so

189
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,060
you didn't get to do last week's news.

190
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,340
But when this story came up, like everybody was like, we need Loki here to talk about

191
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
this.

192
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,900
So I'm going to ask you now VR edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that meta is

193
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,460
talking about.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,660
I already, now for the podcast listeners, you can't see his face, but you can imagine

195
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,540
his face.

196
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm not buying a quest for this.

197
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,580
Like it's stupid.

198
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:27,500
Like they want, they want you to buy the quest to, to play San Andreas, which is super damn

199
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
old.

200
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Like I, like I get it.

201
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Yeah.

202
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,020
It'll be cool in VR, but let's be honest, like if I want to play that in VR, I'm pretty

203
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,380
sure modders can make a version that's in VR.

204
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,260
I'm sure that they've already made a version that's in VR.

205
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
Well, okay.

206
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,660
But to, to be fair, like the conversion of like forcing VR on games that weren't designed

207
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,720
for VR usually stinks.

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,620
Like it's a five minute novelty and then it's like, okay, this is garbage.

209
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,660
Like case in point, whoever modded the 8-bit Nintendo Legend of Zelda to run in VR, like,

210
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
and I'm not knocking this person.

211
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Of course people want to see that.

212
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,820
That was like its own kind of independent thing.

213
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
I get that.

214
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Yeah.

215
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
And it doesn't need to be there.

216
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,140
I think it's just such a gimmick.

217
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:17,260
Like, like it really is just such a gimmick to try to sell the Quest 2, which is stupid

218
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,060
because like I have a Rift S and like, I guess it's just not being supported anymore.

219
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,220
Even though I think it's probably more powerful than the Quest 2.

220
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,980
I mean, after all it's running on a PC, which is arguably more powerful than the Quest 2.

221
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,060
But sure, whatever.

222
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Let's wall it behind.

223
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
I'm not buying another con.

224
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
I'm not buying it.

225
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Sorry.

226
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
You know, I don't care how great it is.

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,620
I'll just not play it.

228
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
So whatever.

229
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,780
I mean, it's, it's fine.

230
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,660
Even like, I think we, they have like the remasters that they just, you know, they talked

231
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,740
about coming out and stuff and they actually, they, at least they did something with that.

232
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,940
At least the graphics look a little bit better.

233
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,660
Not great, but I mean the best, I guess they can do, but it's just very minimal effort.

234
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,260
Like I just don't, I don't care.

235
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Bobby does want to clarify that the meta will no longer support PC VR, mobile VR is where

236
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,800
they see the market share.

237
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,780
And also wants to clarify, he still does not own a Quest.

238
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,380
The Rift has been discontinued.

239
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,300
So just to where are we, how, so we know where VR is at.

240
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
You know what?

241
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,460
I don't care, Facebook.

242
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,380
It works on PC.

243
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,700
There's other VR pro there.

244
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
You know what?

245
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,940
There's, I don't need a walled garden for VR.

246
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
Okay.

247
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I don't.

248
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,460
Honestly, like it's just, there's so much stuff on scene.

249
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Like really, like I don't need to play San Andreas again for like how many times now,

250
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
like I don't care.

251
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm not going to wait for them to put it out on VR.

252
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,380
Now if it was a brand new Grand Theft Auto, which they really should be doing, like, let's

253
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,620
just put it this way, like develop a brand new Grand Theft Auto for the Quest 2 and then,

254
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,460
and then make that a VR only game, then that would be cool.

255
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm sure they're developing a new Grand Theft Auto is just taking forever.

256
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Yeah.

257
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,100
But I understand that, but like before, like there's been lower tier effort, uh, games

258
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,900
that have been put out by Rockstar, like they had a Grand Theft Auto for, uh, the DS, Chinatown

259
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Wars came up last week.

260
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Yeah.

261
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Yeah.

262
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Yeah.

263
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
So like something like that.

264
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,980
Um, I mean the PSP ports are pretty good.

265
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
Those had multiplayer.

266
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,500
That's why I started multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto with, was the PSP stuff.

267
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,220
Um, I just don't like, I would not, I would so not buy a Quest 2 for that.

268
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,100
Like I would just absolutely not, not worth it at all, but more power to them, I guess.

269
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,740
I just think this it's just stupid.

270
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,500
Bobby Blackwoven chat says there's not enough market share of VR to make a new Grand Theft

271
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,660
Auto for VR only.

272
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,180
I do agree with that.

273
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,740
And follows up saying Valve made a brand new Half-Life just for VR and everyone lost their

274
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
shit.

275
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,860
So, um, going back to that first thing that Bobby said there, uh, I thought this was a

276
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,860
good follow up comment and I haven't read this chatter before, so welcome and hello

277
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,980
XC Friesz, I hope I said the right XC Friesz, sorry, I'm not sure how to pronounce that.

278
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
My bad.

279
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,700
Uh, says, uh, I would like to get into VR, but terrified of buying something that will

280
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,260
be obsolete or abandoned soon after.

281
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,620
And I think that's a damn good point, especially when you consider, okay, well, Meta just walked

282
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,260
away from the rift.

283
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,220
That's why for me, and I know Meta's got something else in the works, blah, blah, blah, blah,

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
blah, blah, blah, but for me, that's why I'm like, you know what?

285
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm just going to wait for PlayStation 5 VR because you know, it's coming, you know, it's

286
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,980
going to be a good baseline.

287
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,260
You know, it's going to be solid.

288
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,940
It's going to have a lot of games on it for gamers.

289
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,660
Whereas the Meta stuff will probably have a lot of other crap that Facebook wants to

290
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,900
push on it in some games too.

291
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
So you know what?

292
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,260
I'm just going to hang out for PlayStation 5 VR because I feel like the good baseline

293
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,940
for a gamer who wants VR is a game console doing VR.

294
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
And so that's for me.

295
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,660
The only positive I see with the Quest 2 is that you don't have, you're not really docked

296
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,700
to like a PC.

297
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,940
But really like anywhere in my house, I don't have enough room to do VR.

298
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,300
Like that's why I don't do VR.

299
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,700
That's why my, you know, Rift S is still in the box over here and my PlayStation VR is

300
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,060
in a box in another room.

301
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,100
You could try to do VR, but you'll trip on a toy.

302
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,380
You'll trip on a cat.

303
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,580
Yeah, so, so cat updates since I've been gone for a few weeks.

304
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,380
She's not doing great.

305
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:36,940
She's got, she, she is, health is definitely deteriorating, so she is, she is confined

306
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,280
to the kitchen now.

307
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,780
She does not, she, well, she still can't hear.

308
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,220
And now I think she can't see out of one side.

309
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,760
And so she, and she has brain issues.

310
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,260
So she circles and around and around and around and can't find things.

311
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,960
So then she's, you know, missing her litter box and stuff like that.

312
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,880
So she's, she sleeps now under my desk.

313
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
I don't know where she's wandered off to actually.

314
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
Well there's a lot of love.

315
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
She's under my wheels.

316
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,300
Okay, please don't.

317
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,920
There's a lot of love pouring out from the chat right now.

318
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Send Stella some love from all of us, cause that's always difficult to hear.

319
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,120
Uh, I, did they say what the issue was?

320
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,200
Cause it sounds like almost like some sort of, um, brain.

321
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,080
Well, it is, but they can't do, she wants it still for an X-ray for her head.

322
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,900
And I'm not paying $3,000 to do advanced imaging at like Davis or something like

323
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,960
that, so it's probably something like a tumor or something, who knows, but we're

324
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,980
just keeping her comfortable, I guess for now, you tell me a people, a person has

325
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,780
these problems and I'm like, Oh, that sucks.

326
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,220
She told me a cat has these problems.

327
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,540
Like, like, no, I get very emotional.

328
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,060
So, but yeah, she's, she's been like, cause we, we had, it was weird.

329
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,900
Like she was like going to the bathroom behind the couch and stuff like that.

330
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,500
And just like, kind of like I noticed her circling around a bunch.

331
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,300
And so I don't think she can see out of the one side cause I can kind of come

332
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,380
up beside her and just like, Wave my hand in front of her and she doesn't see it.

333
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,400
Um, but she sees me on the other side.

334
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,760
And so she'll, she'll either follow the wall to, you know, kind of clockwise

335
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,560
around the room or she'll circle around.

336
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,960
Um, I don't know.

337
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,280
Well, she probably appreciates you giving her some cuddles.

338
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
So keep at it a little bit.

339
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah.

340
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,280
She's, she's got her bed underneath my desk, so she's always with me all day long.

341
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,240
And, um, you know, and keeping her locked up in, in the kitchen is good because

342
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,880
she's not getting lost in the house.

343
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,600
Yeah.

344
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,740
Um, so, all right.

345
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh, unfortunately, yeah.

346
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,480
All right.

347
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,880
We've been dealing with the last few weeks.

348
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,080
All right.

349
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Tough topic, but let's try to move on.

350
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,200
We're going to move on into, uh, some video game news going on around the world

351
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,240
and get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about a company I talk a lot

352
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,680
about on this show because I play a lot of their games, it's Niantic and Niantic.

353
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,560
You know, what's interesting just a couple of weeks ago on the show, we had talked

354
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,360
about how Niantic will not be moving forward with the Settlers of Catan game,

355
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,360
uh, that they never released here.

356
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,040
They released it in other countries.

357
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,600
I think Australia, New Zealand was kind of the biggest, um, market they put it out

358
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,560
in, uh, and the Catan game was out there for a while, but they did not continue

359
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,400
development of the game and they canceled it effectively.

360
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Um, they may reuse some of the ideas somewhere else.

361
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,920
It sounded like to me, you know, and again, this is an interpretation.

362
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,160
This is not something they said, but it sounded like to me, them and the Catan

363
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
people were not seeing eye to eye.

364
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,680
The Catan license was likely expensive because Catan people didn't want to

365
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,920
continue with it because they didn't see a new Pokemon go in it or something.

366
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,760
Um, so that's what it sounded like.

367
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Um, kind of a little bit surprising that God, not even a month later, uh, here we

368
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,360
are Niantic is going to be shutting down a game that did launch and launched

369
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,920
everywhere.

370
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,600
Uh, and this was a partnership to be fair with Portkey games.

371
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,760
So it's not just Niantic shutting it down.

372
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,640
Um, but certainly Niantic's name was involved with Harry Potter, Wizard's

373
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,160
Unite.

374
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Um, Harry Potter, Wizard's Unite was kind of the game that came out after Pokemon

375
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,240
Go had a lot of similarities to Pokemon Go.

376
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,080
Certainly instead of capturing Pokemon, you were capturing what?

377
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,840
Like spirits, pages, ghosts, things from the Harry Potter universe, but it did

378
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,800
have a pretty neat battle system that Pokemon Go didn't have instead of like

379
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,840
tapping at gyms, you actually had kind of like your, um, you know, MMO triad of

380
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,760
healer tank, you know, DPS kind of thing going on where you were taking on

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,560
monsters.

382
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
Um, I played the game for a little bit.

383
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,240
Um, I got a little turned off to a lot of Harry Potter related things when, uh, the

384
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,760
author of the books started her social media bullshit, and I'll let you do your

385
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
own research on that.

386
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,520
Um, and my conclusion was that, you know what, I, I don't know how much I want to

387
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,320
be like, yeah, I'm super in Harry Potter right now, which sucks because there's a

388
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,200
lot of people that work on these games that do not share the same viewpoints of

389
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,800
the author.

390
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,640
But when she's out there just saying what she's saying, it's very hard to drop

391
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,960
money into the game, knowing that she's getting money in her pocket.

392
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,240
Um, I just got really bored with it.

393
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,480
And honestly, there's that too.

394
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,280
Like the grind was only good for so long.

395
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,760
Apparently the game got a lot better with the COVID changes that they made.

396
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,720
That's what I heard from the people that were still playing it at that point, um,

397
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,280
that they really added a lot to the game.

398
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
They finally added some stuff that probably should have been there when it

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,280
launched with some of the, um, Epic bosses.

400
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,240
Like you could take out Umbridge and I don't know all the characters, but you

401
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,400
know, some of the, some of the big, big characters, but unfortunately, uh, too

402
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,360
little, too late, I suppose, because the game is going offline on January 31st,

403
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,560
2022.

404
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,360
It will disappear from all the marketplaces December 6th.

405
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,320
In the meantime, go hog because rewards and cool down times will be, uh, I'm

406
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,600
sorry, increased rewards, decreased cool down times.

407
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Basically, you know, they're throwing everything at you to enjoy the game.

408
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,480
Uh, while it's, it's lasting bosses events, they will continue going

409
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
live until the end of January.

410
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,800
If you spent money on the game, though, too bad.

411
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
The money's been spent, the checks have been cashed.

412
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,080
You will not be getting that money back unless there is a law in your country or

413
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,760
something where you must, uh, in the U S ain't one of them.

414
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,040
So, uh, there you go.

415
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Um, it's closing.

416
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,280
Uh, the game had been released in June of 2019.

417
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,160
Honest to God, it felt like a lot longer.

418
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,760
I felt like that game had been out for at least at least three years, not two, but,

419
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
uh, there it is very long.

420
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,240
Yeah, it really doesn't.

421
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,960
And so I don't know, maybe COVID could partially be to blame for that, but I kind

422
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,240
of go back to, it wasn't very popular.

423
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,600
I think like, unfortunately we released it and like Ingress was, it was all right.

424
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,560
Um, everyone's really in the Pokemon go and then.

425
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,640
Wizards of the United seem to be kind of like a third wheel.

426
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,040
It's like, I think people tried it and they were like, eh, that's fine.

427
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
But like, it just didn't have the same power.

428
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,760
Um, Mike Defton chat says, technically it's more WB games shutting down this

429
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,400
game rather than Niantic though.

430
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,080
I believe that to be true.

431
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,600
I believe this is more port key games decisions, and maybe they didn't want to

432
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,600
keep paying to license Niantic light ship.

433
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,960
The, all the portal network, what used to be the Ingress portal network, that is all

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,600
now Niantic light ship, and that is their big, uh, platform of all, like your parks,

435
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,240
your play structures apart, all that shit that was submitted by mostly Ingress

436
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,440
players, and now a good chunk of Pokemon go players, especially in, um, countries

437
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,720
outside the U S uh, that is all now on Niantic light ship.

438
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,240
And actually it's interesting.

439
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,160
A friend of mine who, you know, has played all the, is just like me.

440
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Like I have, you know, it's a lot of my Ingress friends are like me and that they

441
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,760
play all these games.

442
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
They will try all of these games at least once.

443
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,840
We, we just did a walk this weekend.

444
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,280
We were all playing Pikmin and doing a walk while we were playing Ingress.

445
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,160
Like we're just all kind of in that same mindset.

446
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,920
And one of them said to me, you know, um, WB and Warner brothers, porky probably

447
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,280
just didn't want to keep paying the fees for Niantic light ship and want to keep

448
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,520
licensing that you add that into Harry Potter's licensing fees.

449
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,520
That's an expensive game to keep going.

450
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,320
And for what?

451
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,240
And I kind of agree.

452
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,720
I think he hit the nail on the head.

453
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,040
I think it's not just the Harry Potter fee, but now Niantic fee that goes into

454
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,720
this as co-developer, I just don't think the game was worth it to keep running.

455
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,440
It wasn't selling enough of the microtransactions, especially in a COVID

456
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,880
world.

457
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Uh, and that's that.

458
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,320
And that is, and as I expressed last week, that is kind of my fear with the Pikmin

459
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,000
game, the Pikmin game I'm actually rather enjoying because it is a low pressure,

460
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,840
low, um, intensity kind of game.

461
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,520
You can kind of set it and forget it a lot more with Pikmin than you do the other

462
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
Niantic games.

463
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,480
Um, but the microtransactions make no sense at all.

464
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,120
None.

465
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,360
And, uh, I just, I feel like, not that I am encouraging Pikmin to put more stuff

466
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,920
for more microtransactions in the game because I don't really want that.

467
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,840
But at the same time, I also realize, you know, developers have to get paid from

468
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,520
somewhere.

469
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,000
So I'd like there to be something worthwhile for them to toss a coin to.

470
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,960
And I don't think that exists in Pikmin Bloom right now and the Harry Potter game

471
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,600
at least once in a while, once in a while, I would say I probably gave 15 bucks, 10

472
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,920
bucks to Wizards Unite when I was actually playing it when it first came out.

473
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,080
So I, it's, I just hope that doesn't kill the Pikmin game that there's, it's, it

474
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
doesn't make money because I really don't see how the Pikmin game is going to make

475
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
money in its current state anyway.

476
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,320
So, all right.

477
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,320
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat.

478
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,800
Um, yeah, Questbuster points out Pikmin Bloom was just rolled out.

479
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,560
There's a Transformers game as well.

480
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,200
They might have decided to shutter the game to save on costs and push resources to

481
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,840
other projects.

482
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
I believe I could be wrong.

483
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,040
Somebody should fact check me on this, but I believe the Transformers game is like

484
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,600
the Harry Potter game where somebody else is developing it and using Niantic

485
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
Lightship in it.

486
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,040
I could be wrong.

487
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,080
Uh, as Joe and Hunter Mattis pointing out that Niantic is really investing in Pikmin

488
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,560
Bloom, uh, this is probably Nintendo as well.

489
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,760
They've bought some serious airtime and commercials for it, being seen the

490
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,360
commercials for prime during prime time, which isn't cheap.

491
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,640
You didn't see that with Pokemon Go for a while or at all with Pikmin.

492
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Last I checked the Pikmin Bloom is number one in the like adventure games category.

493
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
So, I mean, it's paying off.

494
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,600
It's, it's not 2016 Pokemon Go.

495
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,320
Nothing ever will be again, but Pikmin seems to be doing all right.

496
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,000
But is it, you know, it's getting the installs, but is it making money?

497
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,720
I don't know.

498
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,280
I guess maybe players are probably buying that first timer starter kit thing, but I

499
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,000
don't know if they're getting it, uh, beyond that.

500
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Who knows?

501
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,840
Um, Mike Defton chat says, don't know if this is coming up later, but now you have

502
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,760
a Niantic ID.

503
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,720
No, I did not show all that for later.

504
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,920
I'm glad you did bring that up because, um, yeah, everybody that's played a Niantic

505
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,680
game before is now getting emails to reserve your Niantic ID, but we kind of

506
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
knew this was coming.

507
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,960
If you looked at the acquisitions Niantics made, they've been wanting to build a

508
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,040
social network around this AR gaming.

509
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:13,440
And I, I really think Niantic wants to be in a place like Blizzard, but obviously all

510
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,720
this current stuff we've been talking about Blizzard accepted.

511
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,320
Don't go there.

512
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,080
That's not what I mean.

513
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm talking about like battle net and all the Blizzard infrastructure and how those

514
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,200
games tie together.

515
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,000
And you kind of talk to friends through games and stuff, and they've kind of built

516
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,640
that experience on PC.

517
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,880
I think that's what Niantic wants in the mobile world.

518
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,160
And they think Pokemon go is going to get them there and it just well might to be

519
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,560
honest.

520
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,640
And if they can get Pikmin bloom to catch on huge too, that'll be more people for the

521
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,360
social network and that'll catch on as well.

522
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,480
But Harry Potter wasn't it.

523
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,800
So XC freeze and chat says, I wonder if WWE would be a good license to pick up for

524
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,320
Niantic.

525
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm not sure how that would go into the real world very well, but, uh, yeah, anything's

526
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,080
possible.

527
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,720
I think there's a lot of different licenses.

528
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,920
People would like to see Niantic pick up and go with, but Harry Potter no longer going

529
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,680
to be one of them.

530
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,960
The game is closing.

531
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,120
So that's that.

532
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,560
And again, yeah, I th I don't think any of us are like super surprised.

533
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,680
I feel sorry for my friends that grinded to 60 in that game.

534
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,920
I think if this is what I think would be nice, but I'm not expecting it to happen.

535
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,400
If Niantic is launching a social network and if achievements are to be part of that

536
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
network, which I've been led to believe from some of the tea leaves and the stories that

537
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
have come out, it would be nice for the people that played Harry Potter wizard tonight to

538
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,040
have some sort of legacy achievement on their profile before they ax the game.

539
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,280
But because it's technically port key, and I don't know how that ties in.

540
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,120
I, that may not actually happen, but I do feel bad for those that, you know, really the

541
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,120
grind to level 60 in that game, no fucking joke.

542
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,080
That's a grind.

543
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,360
So, um, it would be nice if people had something to show for it besides Womp Womp, but

544
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,880
that's the reality of mobile games.

545
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,960
Your fave may go away someday.

546
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,160
Anyway, let's move on.

547
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Uh, I talked a little bit about my gaming week in there, but I have more, but we'll

548
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,320
talk, go around the table and talk about our gaming weeks.

549
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,320
So let's go to Dark Sakura as we usually do first and talk about your gaming week.

550
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,800
Dark Sakura.

551
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,840
Pretty uneventful, actually.

552
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,640
I just played, um, Dead by Daylight.

553
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,880
Really?

554
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,840
Um, oh, and I played Mandalorian Pinball, so that was it.

555
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,960
Um, I was going to do Animal Crossing.

556
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Um, real life has happened.

557
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,400
I have had so many projects that I've needed to wrap up that it's not even funny.

558
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,880
So just Dead by Daylight.

559
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
Real life happens.

560
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,120
Where's, um, where's Fantasian at?

561
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
You finished part two, right?

562
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,680
Oh yeah, I did play Fantasian.

563
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,520
I did play Fantasian.

564
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,040
Um, I am at just this really grindy spot and I'm trying to do as many different

565
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:57,880
sub missions as I can, but I think I need to buff up my people quite a bit more.

566
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
It says, oh, you can do this level 42.

567
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,400
Bullshit.

568
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,240
This is like this one attack that's just like completely ridiculous.

569
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,160
And like, I think I want to get my guys up to like 50 before I do it.

570
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah.

571
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,360
Whenever I see a warning like that, I'm like, no, I'll get to 45.

572
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,560
I've been able until this match to do things early.

573
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh, interesting.

574
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Kind of like how I did with Final Fantasy, uh, 10-2, not with 10-2.

575
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,640
Yeah, actually, yeah, it was actually both with 10 and 10-2 that I would just rush

576
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,240
through everything kind of outwit, you know, I guess the enemies.

577
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,160
And then I would finally get to a point where I couldn't do that because

578
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,800
it was all a matter of a power game.

579
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,120
And that's where I am on Fantation.

580
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,680
Um, and then how's how's Dead by Daylight been going?

581
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
You enjoying the Halloween event?

582
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,920
I am.

583
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,320
Um, I love stepping on pumpkins before the salty survivors can.

584
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,120
Um, I've actually had just like some funny people, like just like automatically

585
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,160
it's like, Hey, let's farm.

586
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm like, okay, let's farm.

587
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:13,160
I made, um, new Twitch emotes for my channel that are very on point for me.

588
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,760
I have made a pig, a no boop and a boop.

589
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,480
Cause the no boop is no booping without consent.

590
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,680
You must always ask your pig before you boop her.

591
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,360
Which, which, but you can't chat in the game.

592
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,840
So you have to use nonverbal cues to do that.

593
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,160
Exactly.

594
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,120
If that pig growls at you, run, run.

595
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,720
All right.

596
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,840
Uh, let's go to Loki.

597
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,800
You have a couple of weeks.

598
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,000
I saw you had a new Minecraft video this week over on your YouTube channel at

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Loki, OLR, plug, plug, plug, plug.

600
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
I did have a new Minecraft video.

601
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,040
So I finished the Ninjago city, uh, build that I was doing.

602
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,560
I got to add to it and I've been, uh, playing on multiple servers recently.

603
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,280
So it's, I've wasted a few days just playing Minecraft instead

604
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,440
of making stuff for Minecraft.

605
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,920
Um, so I'll be doing, uh, some more stuff for that soon.

606
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,240
I've been in the design process for that.

607
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
I know what I wanted to make.

608
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,240
I just have to design it.

609
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,880
And then, um, I played a little bit of, uh, Poppy's playtime chapter one.

610
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,400
This is the new hotness as far as a horror games go.

611
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,240
So it's,

612
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh God, I saw someone streaming this the other night.

613
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,440
It looked fucking scary.

614
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,160
It's like, it's like, it's got a five nights vibe because it's all

615
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,520
like the plate, like play things.

616
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,880
Right.

617
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,200
But it's like, she was in an event, like climbing around the vent and

618
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
like the little, Oh my God, I couldn't play this.

619
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,360
I could not play this.

620
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

621
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,920
Uh, I do like it.

622
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,600
It reminds me a lot of a little bit, like, uh, the puzzle solving and

623
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,240
portal because of the mechanics that they have in it.

624
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,640
So it's pretty fun, but yeah, there's, it's definitely more of like a

625
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,720
scary, almost FNAF type game.

626
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm curious to see how this compares to like, say, uh, the

627
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,720
new FNAF game coming out.

628
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,080
So, um, curious to see how that is.

629
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,000
And then, uh, aside from that, I played a little bit of Orna

630
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
because I got a new phone.

631
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,960
So I was just messing around with that to see how much it's changed.

632
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
It's changed quite a bit.

633
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,600
Um, yeah, not very interested in it though.

634
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
It's more of like, you know, I'm sitting here, kids are doing piano

635
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
and I have nothing to do.

636
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,880
I've run out of internet to look at and play Orna for a sec.

637
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,480
Um, yeah, I don't know something to talk about, not having the same power.

638
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Um, a couple of things I did want to mention though, cause I

639
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
haven't gotten to mention it yet.

640
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,280
So, uh, the game that you guys know called the pixel poops.

641
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,440
Number two is being featured in a magazine.

642
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,760
So the next issue of cool shit magazine, Bobby brought this up on his show.

643
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

644
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,760
Well, it was the week we were out.

645
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah.

646
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,880
So cool shit magazine, which is I think a UK publication, uh, somewhat

647
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,880
indie, they cover like retro gaming and.

648
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,200
Um, stuff like that.

649
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,760
And so they're going to have, they had like a kind of a giveaway thing where,

650
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,760
uh, the guy was running an ad, a one page ad, and he was also raffling

651
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,880
off, I guess, um, a couple like preview spots.

652
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,480
And so he, I got one of the previous spots, so he's going to cover the

653
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,080
game as a preview and like play through it and stuff and like, talk about that.

654
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,680
And then also at the same time, there's the, I want to say it's a Midwest

655
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,960
Midwest gaming conference or convention or something like that, a gaming classic

656
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,600
Midwest gaming classic there's the folks at, uh, nest maker that are there as well.

657
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,040
And they have, they're still in beta and it's not really open to the public yet

658
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,920
retro verse site, which is going to be featuring all of the nest maker games

659
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,800
that people have made.

660
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,640
And of course, one of those being pixel poops, number two.

661
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,040
So there's a chance that people that are at Midwest gaming classic or we're at

662
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,600
that, got a chance to play pixel poops number two.

663
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,200
So that's great.

664
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
I've been getting emails on that.

665
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
Like, did you give them my email?

666
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,240
I've been getting emails on that, but I'm like, oh, that's nice.

667
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,400
But it's like too far for me to really travel out there on a moment's notice.

668
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,880
But I've been seeing the, I didn't realize that was tied to your or either

669
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,920
that, or it's a big enough thing where it's a big, it's a big convention.

670
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Wow.

671
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,480
It's not just, yeah.

672
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I don't know how the hell they got my email, but cool.

673
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,840
They had a booth.

674
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeah.

675
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,200
So they had a booth and there's some of the developers that also had booths there.

676
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
So one of them must be a listener.

677
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
So one of them, that's it.

678
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,800
One of them is a listener, I bet.

679
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,480
So shout out.

680
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,360
Yeah.

681
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,040
So I'm definitely have to pick up a copy of that magazine once it comes out.

682
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,920
Um, I don't know how to pick it up.

683
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,120
Maybe Barnes and Noble has something like that.

684
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,520
I don't know.

685
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,680
I don't know how wide their publication is.

686
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,960
Uh, might be able to order from Amazon UK.

687
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
Sometimes they'll ship to the U S and sometimes, uh, Amazon Canada will ship.

688
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,640
We also have some very kind listeners in the UK who may reach out to you on Twitter

689
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,720
and maybe can help you arrange something like that.

690
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,560
So at low key.

691
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,120
Also, I think the guy has, uh, yeah, so they do have an actual website as well.

692
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,720
Um, which I'll link in chat here.

693
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,160
Um, so they actually, I think they sell through the website as well.

694
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,800
Nice.

695
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,320
But, uh, I really want to see that.

696
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,880
I mean, if, uh, let me know how ordering the magazine goes.

697
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,080
I'll order my own copy, uh, if, uh, if it goes well, so let me know.

698
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,680
That's awesome.

699
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,040
Um, Just some quick followups, uh, in chat before I lose them quest

700
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,280
Buster did some research and wanted to mention the transformers game

701
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,000
that we brought up earlier.

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,920
That new AR game coming out, uh, quest buster did some research and

703
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,120
found it's an indie studio named very, very spaceship working with Niantic.

704
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,880
Thank you for researching that.

705
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,480
I appreciate you.

706
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,920
That's what I thought, uh, was that it was, uh, not actually developed by Niantic

707
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,360
and pod culture about the poppy.

708
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,240
What's that game called?

709
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,480
Poppy poppy poppy makes you poop.

710
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,840
No, it was Poppy's playhouse.

711
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,240
That's it.

712
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,840
Poppy's playoffs.

713
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,120
Okay.

714
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,720
Cause, uh, I was watching it's it's me Holly last night.

715
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,520
That's that's who, God damn it.

716
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,120
You always follow me on Twitter.

717
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,160
That's who I was watching.

718
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
I was looking after she played it and she was talking about it.

719
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,960
It was while she was playing medium.

720
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,120
I'm just dying.

721
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,200
You guys, you guys seriously don't know.

722
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,400
I will be in a channel and finally I'll decide to un-lurk and say, cause like I

723
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
usually watch on my Xbox, I have to get on my phone to actually type a message and

724
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,080
I'll say something and then dark soccer goes, Rob, she is all.

725
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I'm like, do you have 10 tabs open with all the channels I watch?

726
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,840
You're always there.

727
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:27,040
I just like every so often I may have, I may lurk in a few other people's channels,

728
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,560
like, especially if I followed a raid.

729
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Yeah.

730
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,720
But most of the time I pick one person and stay there.

731
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,440
But that's why, yeah, Holly is who I was watching play it as well.

732
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
She's very fun and animated and yeah, that game.

733
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,160
So anyway.

734
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,760
Okay.

735
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,960
So about that game, pod culture said next VOG point event, Rob plays this game live

736
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,480
and SSU 100 Matt says, not enough points to get Rob to play that.

737
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,640
Matt is correct.

738
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,200
You want this to happen?

739
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,040
We're going to be talking cash.

740
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,600
We're going to be talking charity event.

741
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,680
What charity?

742
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,240
I don't know.

743
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,960
Um, maybe cats.

744
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
Cause that's the thing, especially thinking about what Loki's going through.

745
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,320
And that's the thing we all love.

746
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,200
We all have our cats.

747
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,680
So maybe a cat charity.

748
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,640
Um, but I, I, I'm not going to set an amount yet.

749
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,080
I have to, I have to crunch some numbers and figure out what sounds

750
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,440
realistic, uh, to do something like that.

751
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
But, uh, no, you want that.

752
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,360
You have to show the money to the cats, uh, to make that happen.

753
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,080
So we'll see.

754
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,640
It's like a five nights type game.

755
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,400
It's not like it's, it's, it's not necessarily in the style.

756
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,280
I mean, it's five nights as far as like, if there's like animatronic

757
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,600
things that are alive, it's basically, it is a first person like puzzle game.

758
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,320
But there's horror stuff in it as well.

759
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,520
So that's why I kind of compared it to portal a little bit because

760
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,760
you've got these kind of like grabber hands that you put on.

761
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
And so you solve puzzles with it.

762
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
It's, it's pretty cool.

763
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,520
This looks, but it's also horror.

764
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
It's scary as fuck.

765
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,800
It doesn't look scary.

766
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,600
It looks adorable.

767
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,440
It's not necessarily adorable.

768
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,000
You probably want to play it.

769
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,600
That scary stuff is, uh, of course it's only on, um, on a PC.

770
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,920
Um, I think it's a really small studio, maybe like even one

771
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,880
person just putting it together.

772
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,840
So they only have one chapter right now.

773
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,720
That's out, that's like $5.

774
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,760
But in each piece, each episode is gonna be like five bucks as well.

775
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,920
I'm still going to go ahead and buy it now because I might

776
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,600
be able to play this on ARM.

777
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,960
So that'd be cool.

778
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Uh, Mike Deft warns don't have more than three tabs of Twitch opened.

779
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,080
I forgot that that was a thing.

780
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,480
Yeah.

781
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,760
Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, I think it, all your views are

782
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
all your views don't count.

783
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,880
Cause it thinks you're a bot.

784
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
It thinks you're a view bot.

785
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,800
If you have more than three open.

786
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,440
Well, I, I've got, I don't have any more than that usually.

787
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:43,920
Yeah.

788
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,920
Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, geez, am I the only one not wanting

789
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
to see her friend get traumatized?

790
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,040
Thank you.

791
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,840
But like, Hey, like I said earlier, cats are more important than people.

792
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,480
So I'll get traumatized to try to save a cat.

793
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,040
I'll do it.

794
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,480
Um, so there you go.

795
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,560
All right, Loki, I'm sorry.

796
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,640
We derailed a little bit from your gaming week.

797
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
So what else?

798
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Sorry.

799
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,960
Alan came in the room.

800
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,920
Alan, the viewers are talking about Polly.

801
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,200
Playroom Polly's playroom, playtime, poppy playtime.

802
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,760
So, okay.

803
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,760
So they're trying to get me to play Poppy's playtime and with vlog points.

804
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,560
And I'm like, Oh no, no, no.

805
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,040
You want to see this happen.

806
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,120
You got to show money and we're going to do like a cat charity or something

807
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,240
like that if you want Poppy playtime to happen, have you, are you familiar

808
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,680
with Poppy play, Alan walked in the room.

809
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,800
Let me let him make comment.

810
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,080
Have you, have you seen this game?

811
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,680
Alan, what did you think?

812
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
I can't, I can't really get on camera the way it's set up right

813
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,400
now, um, episode one is out.

814
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
It's a very short demo.

815
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,200
Um, I don't want to give it away.

816
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,000
Basically.

817
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
There's just one really intense sequence.

818
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,720
And then if you make it through that, then it's like, congrats.

819
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,600
Wait for episode two.

820
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,920
So, I mean, I would say that you would be better off playing that than

821
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,240
you would a five night at Freddy's TBH.

822
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,920
I mean, it's, it's scary, but it's just, you know, it's a buildup.

823
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,440
And then, you know, the climax.

824
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,600
All right.

825
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,280
Fair enough.

826
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,640
Thank you.

827
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,600
Thank you for popping in.

828
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,800
Hey, Rob.

829
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,440
Yeah.

830
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,720
What?

831
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,840
You're going to want to check your steam and about,

832
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,640
I mean, like, I want to call you names, but then it's like, when you send me gifts,

833
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,920
like it's hard to call you names, but just know the urge is there.

834
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,760
There you go.

835
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,080
And you'll probably like the name I sent it from too.

836
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,760
Great.

837
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,360
All right.

838
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,120
All right.

839
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,600
Loki.

840
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,160
We've derailed.

841
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
Congratulations, Rob.

842
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,320
You have a scary game.

843
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,120
We've derailed the cats.

844
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,760
Say thank you.

845
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,880
Uh, Loki, I've derailed your gaming week three times now.

846
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,800
Anything else for your gaming week?

847
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
Um, that's it.

848
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,880
I'm probably going to have to dust off my Xbox series X though, for next week,

849
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,080
because you know, we got fours of horizon five coming, so I got to play a little bit

850
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,120
of that at least our pal Bobby Black Wolf was, uh, got to have the look at that game.

851
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,160
Cause he, uh, did the, you know, addition that had the early launch

852
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,720
and, uh, his, uh, reactions on his show were very good.

853
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,800
Very, very good.

854
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,480
Oh, thank you.

855
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,560
Alan just brought into the room and reminded me.

856
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,920
So dark soccer, can you see my cam dark soccer?

857
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
Are you, do you have Twitch open?

858
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,520
Um, I usually don't play the thing.

859
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,880
Well, um, for some reason it says I'm not hosting, hold on, give me just a second.

860
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,840
Cause cause Alan came in here, reminded me, we have something for you, dark soccer.

861
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,480
And I, I can't, Alan, can you hold that closer to the cancer?

862
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,480
The name can, that the name is a little, see, it actually says.

863
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,080
Sakura, but in addition to that, Alan decided he wanted to add something extra into it.

864
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,120
Can you put that on cam as well?

865
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,160
Yeah.

866
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,760
Or what, whatever, I thought you bought one for her.

867
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,800
Oh, and Alan says they just opened this store at Arden fair where I found this.

868
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,400
It opened at Arden fair on Saturday.

869
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,080
So this, no, no, no mini, mini.

870
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
So mini cell.

871
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, okay.

872
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,440
And it just opened.

873
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:56,920
Cool.

874
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,000
Wait, are these for Jamie or?

875
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh, those are for you.

876
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,120
Oh, okay.

877
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,520
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,640
These are not for you, Jamie.

879
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:03,960
Sorry.

880
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,560
He just wants to show them off, but he got a Pokemon face mask with mu.

881
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,240
And I think there's some other Pokemon face masks as well.

882
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,640
Oh, there's an act deaf.

883
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,920
That's an act deaf face mask.

884
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,520
So there you go.

885
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,880
Mike deaf says, oh, we have a mini.

886
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,520
So where I live.

887
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,080
Well, there you go.

888
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,680
You got to go get that Kirby face mask.

889
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
Oh, that one's super cute.

890
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,600
Oh, I know the, the, the crime shop.

891
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,080
I've I buy a lot of their masks.

892
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,320
I saw the new, um, was it build a bear, uh, animal crossing figures.

893
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,840
They had them in the storefront when we went by there the other day.

894
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,560
They had a line out the door for something.

895
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,280
I don't know.

896
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,680
Probably those certainly wasn't animal crossing stuff.

897
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,600
I, I just ordered my, um, Tom Nook, uh, holiday ornament.

898
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Love it.

899
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,320
All right.

900
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,920
My gaming week, um, kind of along the same lines as dark soccer.

901
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,360
I had a lot going on this week.

902
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,160
Um, I've been going hog on Pikmin bloom.

903
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,200
Like Pikmin bloom kind of came out at a really good time where I'm trying

904
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,560
to really change my lifestyle.

905
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,600
And you know, of these past couple of years, COVID has taken its toll

906
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
in many, many, many ways.

907
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,400
Um, and walking, um, is something I really need to be doing more of.

908
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,680
And I think Pikmin's like this game came out at the right time to

909
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,040
really incentivize some of that.

910
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,480
So I'm level 17 in Pikmin bloom.

911
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,400
I'm not the highest on my friends list though.

912
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,840
Uh, somebody, somebody I'm friends with in Korea is level 20.

913
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,600
I think 21 at this point.

914
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,800
So, um, yeah, but I, I've just been having a good time, uh, walking and

915
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,760
just knowing that I'm leaving a little trail of flowers.

916
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,240
When I, when I opt into it and, uh, sending a little Pikmin on adventures,

917
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,960
you have to get, and for those that are getting into the game,

918
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,200
you unlock things slowly.

919
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,720
And I didn't even know this last week,

920
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,280
but once you get to level 15, you have to get all the way to level 15.

921
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,520
Then you unlock Pikmin Bloom's version of raids where you can go beat up on

922
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,720
mushrooms, which I guess is, um, from the console games.

923
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,960
Uh, and you get little like postcards and, and limited pedal things from that.

924
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,560
So you get like some good stuff from that.

925
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,040
So, um, yeah.

926
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,280
Uh, Pikmin Bloom is super cute and I'm still playing that.

927
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,960
Otherwise kind of the same stuff.

928
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,640
Final Fantasy 14.

929
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,120
Uh, I am, uh, just got my Warrior to 77 and that is my last job to get to 80.

930
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,960
I hit Black Mage 80 in the last week.

931
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,400
So only one more job to get to 80 and then everything will be 80.

932
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,120
Only other thing to really mention for my gaming week, No Man's Sky.

933
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,440
It took me a little bit because the new expedition came out that weekend.

934
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,720
I went to Disneyland, but, um, I'm finally, I was like, okay,

935
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,520
two weeks is enough for them to patch everything that went wrong

936
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,960
with the expedition when it came out.

937
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,440
So I started playing the expedition, like for realsies.

938
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,360
And, uh, I'm up to phase two in the X, I just got to the second,

939
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,080
uh, rendezvous point, uh, in, in there.

940
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,160
So I've still got a few more phases to go.

941
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,480
It's all about worms, sandworms that, that fly out of the planet.

942
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,160
And it didn't hit me.

943
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,280
Okay, tremors.

944
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,760
Well, no, what it is, it's not officially a tie-in, but you know, it's timed because of Dune.

945
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,320
It's a tie-in to the Dune movie, although not officially.

946
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,760
So they did the sandworm expedition right when the Dune movie released.

947
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,560
So, um, not tremors, but close.

948
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,240
So, uh, I, I think anyway, obviously they're not going to confirm or deny that,

949
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,560
but it is a very interesting coincidence for sure.

950
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,520
So, um, that is, that is what's going on in No Man's Sky.

951
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,560
All right.

952
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,480
Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.

953
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,600
I don't have any show schedule updates to really get out there.

954
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,800
Uh, as far as I know, we're not having any shows off in the future.

955
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,760
So let's move on.

956
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,280
We still need to schedule.

957
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,880
You guys did meet the point reward for Orange Lounge Fudio.

958
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,520
I just need to pin down a date with my co-host for that to happen.

959
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,480
So we'll work on that.

960
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,000
It will be sometime this month, just in time for Thanksgiving.

961
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,800
All right.

962
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,400
In the meantime, let's get into some, uh, gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight

963
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,440
with, uh, kind of the company that has been a reoccurring headline in the last few months.

964
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,320
Yeah.

965
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,680
So Activision Blizzard.

966
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,840
So the announcement that Jen O'Neill, who was one of the, uh, I'm not exactly sure what

967
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,200
position she had.

968
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,440
She was, um, I guess one of the top positions in Blizzard.

969
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,360
And that was kind of a big deal because, you know, female in a top position at a company

970
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:26,360
that's has, uh, see allegedly very misogynistic, uh, tendencies.

971
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,760
Uh, she is stepping down, uh, immediately, or at least I used to say at the end of the

972
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,920
year, she will be stepping down and Mike Ybarra is going to be taking over, um, those

973
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,800
duties as well.

974
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,320
And, you know, basically, of course, a dude.

975
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,640
Yeah.

976
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,200
According to the ABK Alliance, you know, they said, this is a sad moment for many of us

977
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,920
at ABK who are very excited to have a new experience, uh, with women of color heading

978
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,720
our company.

979
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,480
We found out during our shareholder meeting and wish Jen well in her future endeavors.

980
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,200
Um, along with that as well.

981
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,600
And I'm not sure if this is related to the drama, but, uh, apparently Overwatch two and

982
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,480
Diablo four have been delayed to 2023.

983
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,640
They're still, uh, planning to deliver substantial amounts of content, uh, from Blizzard next

984
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,120
year, but, uh, now playing later launches for those two games.

985
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,360
Define substantial.

986
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,480
I'm going to guess the Diablo mobile game, I think is finally going to line.

987
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,400
I think they've said it's going to launch early 2022, but beyond that question mark,

988
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,120
um, I don't know.

989
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,320
And maybe a Hearthstone expansion or something, but it's, it's, I don't think substantial

990
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,320
is an interesting word for them to use now.

991
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,480
And this chance we're going to get so many candy crush updates.

992
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
This plays into what I said last week.

993
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,160
I know you weren't here, Loki, but, um, you certainly heard about the virtual Blizzcon

994
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,920
getting canceled early next year.

995
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,320
And I said there, what do they have to show?

996
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,080
They have games that they shown already.

997
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,360
And if they want to give an update on Overwatch two, they'll just drop a trailer out of nowhere

998
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:58,920
on us.

999
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,720
You know what I mean?

1000
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,760
And so I, I, and now, now of course, a week later, we hear the games get delayed another,

1001
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,000
you know, which again, okay.

1002
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,120
I'm, I'm of two minds.

1003
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,120
And I said this last week and I'm sorry to repeat myself.

1004
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,640
I'm of two minds of this.

1005
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,200
Yes.

1006
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,200
I understand the great Miyamoto and I agree with this and I understand the great quote

1007
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,680
that we always say everybody always fucking says with delays.

1008
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,980
Yes.

1009
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,400
A good game is always good, but a bad game is forever bad.

1010
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,800
And no one will remember that you delayed a game, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1011
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,520
We all know that.

1012
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:26,840
Yes.

1013
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,800
I do agree with that.

1014
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,080
However, guess what?

1015
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,680
No game makes no money.

1016
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,240
And Blizzard is in, is really in a circumstance here, especially with wow, losing the players

1017
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,280
that they've been losing.

1018
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,760
Like, wow has, or Blizzard has got to figure out how to get these games out faster.

1019
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,840
They really do.

1020
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,040
I, I, and I, I don't understand how like a new call of duty game will be all hands on

1021
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,640
fucking deck around Activision, but Overwatch won't.

1022
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,520
And yes, before somebody in chat, corrects me.

1023
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:56,760
Yes.

1024
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,920
Call of duty sells buku millions billions.

1025
00:47:59,480 --> 00:47:59,720
Yes.

1026
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,320
That is the very clear reason why it is all hands on deck for a call of duty game.

1027
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,320
Why can't it be some hands on deck for Overwatch though?

1028
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,480
You know, to try to, and look, I get there's a certain level of quality we expect.

1029
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,040
Yes.

1030
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:20,280
That can all be true with the right oversight of the game, but like Blizzard has got to

1031
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,840
step on it.

1032
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,080
And all these, all these people, like the Overwatch guy leaving the Diablo guy leaving

1033
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,720
Jen O'Neill now leaving isn't helping.

1034
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,120
It's not helping the speed situation.

1035
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,840
Like Blizzard needs new leadership.

1036
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,840
Mikey Barra.

1037
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,640
Okay, cool.

1038
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,720
Like he did a lot of good stuff with Microsoft.

1039
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,760
Let's see what he's got.

1040
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,200
I'm not going to discount him.

1041
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,440
Let's see if he, you know, has it in him to fix what's going on with Blizzard.

1042
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,240
You know, but I also kind of think he can't do it alone.

1043
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,720
I don't necessarily mean he needs a co-chair.

1044
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,760
I thought it was nice, but he probably doesn't need one, but, um, he's going to need support

1045
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,840
all the way from the top at Activision for sure.

1046
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,440
Anyway, um, Mike Defton chat says the thing here, Rob, with all the people that left over

1047
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,600
the past six months, how can they work on a game without any sort of leadership or management?

1048
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:15,320
And honestly, it is somebody has got to come in and clean up the rodeo and get it going

1049
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,720
fast.

1050
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,280
I Mikey Barra has a big job ahead of a big Jen O'Neill did too, but she found an option

1051
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,640
that worked better for her at the same time for her professional growth.

1052
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,280
Good for her.

1053
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,200
Is anyone going to fault her for leaving Blizzard to, what does it start her own charity or

1054
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,520
work on this board of this charity or whatever it is that supports the wider picture of supporting

1055
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,240
women in gaming?

1056
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,280
Am I getting that all correct?

1057
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:43,560
Is her reasons for leaving who's going to fault her for that, but somebody's still got

1058
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,760
to come in and clean up the mess.

1059
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,320
I don't know.

1060
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,760
It's, it's, it's just sad.

1061
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:59,640
I do feel like the big card, the T card that Blizzard might have in their pocket for 2022.

1062
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,080
And I, I, I'm going to say it now is this, I think absolutely this has to happen whether

1063
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,960
it's a mess or not.

1064
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,400
They're going to drop wrath of the Lich King classic.

1065
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:09,720
Wow.

1066
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,480
Absolutely.

1067
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,680
Because that was the peak of world of Warcraft.

1068
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,720
And I do feel like there are people that will go, go back to world of Warcraft specifically

1069
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,000
for that expansion.

1070
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,520
I don't think it'll be nearly as many as played while in the Heyday, but that's, that's the

1071
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,880
T card that Blizzard has in their back pocket that I do think they will drop in 2022 when

1072
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,560
that probably wasn't in their original plan.

1073
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,360
Anyway, yeah.

1074
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,440
S2-100 Matt says lost Vikings.

1075
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,040
Ooh, a new lost Vikings project.

1076
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,080
Wouldn't that be fabulous?

1077
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,480
I think that would be great.

1078
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,360
It'd be nice, but would it happen?

1079
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,800
Probably not.

1080
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,240
It is a little niche at this point, unless, you know, Blizzard, whoever can put a really

1081
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,680
shiny coat of paint on it.

1082
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,480
The other card that Blizzard has in their back pocket, Vicarious Visions.

1083
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,360
They did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.

1084
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:08,360
Honestly, the, the only problem with the Diablo 2 remaster is that it was, it was, it was

1085
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,400
Diablo 2.

1086
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,400
It was, that's not a bad, hold on before you put your pitchworks and torches down.

1087
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,080
Diablo 2 is a great game.

1088
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,320
It is a monumental game in gaming history, but it's an old game and there's a lot of

1089
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,760
quality of life things that have changed a lot in the industry and with those types of

1090
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,800
games since then.

1091
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,880
And it's a little hard sometimes to go back to that old way with Diablo 2.

1092
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,840
Otherwise, Vicarious Visions did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.

1093
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:39,640
So the big question mark, what is Vicarious Visions working on now?

1094
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,760
Is it another remaster?

1095
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,760
And that was the studio that Jen O'Neill had, that was her studio.

1096
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,960
That's where she was pulled from.

1097
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,640
What is the game that they are working on?

1098
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,480
And if anybody's doing a Lost Vikings remake justice,

1099
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,760
them, but we'll see.

1100
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,240
But I think that is the big question that we have to figure out to see if there really

1101
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,280
are monumental Blizzard releases coming this year.

1102
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,520
What is Vicarious Visions working on?

1103
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,360
That is the $50,000 question.

1104
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,520
Moving on.

1105
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,480
Let's talk about another studio that's having a lot of problems, um, internally.

1106
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,360
And it's one that, admittedly, we probably haven't shown the spotlight on enough.

1107
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,200
Because, you know, just looking at the games that we tend to talk about here on OLR, we

1108
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,040
collectively, as the hosts, have probably spent more time playing the World of Warcraft,

1109
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:39,400
the Overwatches, the Diablos than we have the Far Cry's, the Assassin's Creed.

1110
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,520
Not to say we don't play those games, just not as many hours spent on them.

1111
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,160
I used to play Far Cry, just not, you know.

1112
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,080
But did you hear what I said?

1113
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,680
Not as many hours, right?

1114
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,120
Collectively, between the three of us.

1115
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,440
So we don't often shine the light on Ubisoft.

1116
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Well, how about, I think one a lot of people, the Super Mario Rayman Rabbids, the tech game

1117
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,840
that that was, I can't, why can't I remember the name?

1118
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,880
Mario vs. Rabbids, Mario Rabbids, that whole thing.

1119
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,680
That's Ubisoft.

1120
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:12,680
Anyway, the point is, I've been sitting here on the show going, it has been X number of

1121
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,480
days since the ABK letter's been responded to.

1122
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,800
What I have failed to highlight, and I'm sorry, is that the Ubisoft letter has also gone unresponded

1123
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,280
to, and as of the taping of tonight's show, still has.

1124
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:33,000
In fact, it has been 100 days as of November 5th, so today would be day 102.

1125
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,360
At Twitter account, A Better Ubisoft, very familiar to what we saw with A Better ABK,

1126
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,800
A Better Ubisoft tweeted, 100 days ago, we signed our open letter and set our four key

1127
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,680
demands.

1128
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,600
None of our demands have been met.

1129
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:52,520
So today, we're launching a new petition open for all of our supporters to sign, and it

1130
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,200
is basically targeted right at Yves Guillemin in another tweet saying, you disappoint us.

1131
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,400
100 days, zero demands met.

1132
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,080
Surely you can do better than this.

1133
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,680
Interesting, the phrasing is right out of those Far Cry 6 emails that were sent to all

1134
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,800
the people that were playing that game and then kind of like abandoned it for a few days.

1135
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,240
They got those emails out of the blue that were like, you disappoint me, you, but it's

1136
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,600
like from the villain in the game.

1137
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,160
Oh, clever, clever, clever.

1138
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,120
They really like spamming you if you don't play their stupid game.

1139
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,160
Oh yeah, this is a whole big thing because it led into a discussion about how the games

1140
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:32,600
track your play and all this, but you, you, when you click the agreed all those terms

1141
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,120
and conditions for you play or whatever it's called, guess what?

1142
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,400
You told them they could email you.

1143
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,600
So that's why people are getting emails.

1144
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,760
Yeah, but don't, there's also other ways of getting the emails blocked.

1145
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,040
Oh yeah, oh yeah, if I got one of those emails, I just report a spam, done.

1146
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,720
The Gmail filters are pretty good on that as are most email systems.

1147
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,840
As a reminder, the four, a better Ubisoft key demands.

1148
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,760
Number one, stop promoting and moving note offenders from studio to studio.

1149
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,360
Team to team with no repercussions.

1150
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,480
The cycle needs to end.

1151
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,360
Number two, we want a collective seat at the table to have a meaningful say in how Ubisoft

1152
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,200
as a company moves forward from here.

1153
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,280
Number three, cross industry collaboration to agree on a set of ground rules and processes

1154
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,880
that all studios can use to handle these offenses in the future.

1155
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,000
Number four, this collaboration must heavily involve employees in non-management positions

1156
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,080
and union representatives.

1157
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,280
What here is so fucking crazy?

1158
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,520
They're like, honestly, these are, these are really, this bar is very low.

1159
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:39,560
Yeah.

1160
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,880
In my opinion, number five, in my opinion, underlined bolded,

1161
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,240
number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.

1162
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,080
Yeah, but absolutely.

1163
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,280
They're not going to go there.

1164
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,960
Certainly the employees aren't going to go there.

1165
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,920
I will go there.

1166
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,720
Number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.

1167
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,760
Why not give Jay Allard a call?

1168
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,800
Why don't you see how he's doing?

1169
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,400
Run a company like shit, get a shitty result.

1170
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,020
Totally.

1171
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,520
The petition is quite simply, I support, it's a Google doc.

1172
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,720
So that's why it's a little tricky.

1173
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,160
I can't just give you the URL, but I can give you the link to the Twitter account,

1174
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,120
A Better Ubisoft.

1175
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,040
100 days since our open letter and none of our demands have been met.

1176
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,560
This new petition is open to everyone who supports a better Ubisoft campaign.

1177
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,040
Please add your name, show your support of at A Better Ubisoft on Twitter and share this link.

1178
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,160
I will fill this out on the show right now

1179
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:41,000
and say from all of us at the world's longest running video game podcast, Orange Lounge Radio.

1180
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,520
But of course we should all sign individually as well,

1181
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,520
but I'm going to go ahead and sign it from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio

1182
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,360
and our thoughts to those employees at Ubisoft,

1183
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,360
who I don't think are asking for anything unrealistic by having a seat at the table.

1184
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,800
SHJ 100 Matt in chat says,

1185
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,600
why does Yves Guillemin still have a job?

1186
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,480
It's baffling to me.

1187
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,200
He's still there.

1188
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,560
It all happened on his watch.

1189
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,240
Everyone else got let go except him.

1190
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,520
I understand he's the co-founder CEO, but why isn't the board pressing anything?

1191
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:11,880
Because men.

1192
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,280
I don't, I do not have an answer outside of what Dark Soccer just said.

1193
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,600
There is no answer.

1194
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,640
There is no spoon.

1195
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,720
There is no, there is nothing.

1196
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,040
It doesn't make sense.

1197
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,540
Resign.

1198
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,280
Bitch.

1199
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,680
All right.

1200
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,360
Because he's got a dick.

1201
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,920
I mean, I'm sorry.

1202
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,240
It's, and I'm not, okay.

1203
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,880
For anyone who thinks, I'm laughing at Twitch, not you, sorry.

1204
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,120
For anyone who thinks that calling something out like that is misandry,

1205
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,800
you can, first of all, take your tiny little brain, vomit it, and then shove it back up your ass.

1206
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,120
Number two, this is the way that the world is.

1207
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,920
I am not wrong.

1208
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:57,800
Just saying.

1209
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,520
The comment that made me laugh on Twitch,

1210
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,440
SSG100Matt says, sign up from that Catholic school that tagged OLR in that random tweet.

1211
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,080
We get tagged.

1212
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,480
Go check out OLR's Twitter.

1213
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,480
We get tagged in the, okay, look, we're very lucky.

1214
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,840
We've been on Twitter so fucking long.

1215
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,360
The show's existed so fucking long.

1216
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,280
We have a three letter Twitter name.

1217
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,760
You actually can't get those anymore.

1218
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,800
My old Twitter name used to be Skye, S-K-I-E.

1219
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,560
You, I can't get it back.

1220
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,600
Even if I wanted to.

1221
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,920
I don't because I now, I don't really go by Skye online anymore.

1222
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,320
My brand quote unquote is Rob Roberts or on Twitter because the spammer got it.

1223
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,440
Mr. Rob Roberts.

1224
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,640
So follow, plug plug.

1225
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,880
But you can't get a Twitter name with less than four characters at this point anymore.

1226
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,240
So the fact that we're sitting on OLR, number one, is a gold mine anyway.

1227
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,040
But number two, we get like, there's all sorts of, I guess there's some fucking school out there

1228
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,200
that's OLR because we were getting tagged in like bullshit referee.

1229
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,600
Just go look at twitter.com slash OLR.

1230
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,080
It's weird.

1231
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,840
And I actually, I replied to it and I quote tweeted it and I said, ma'am, this is a podcast.

1232
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,160
I thought it was funny anyway.

1233
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,380
All right.

1234
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,640
Oh, did they say they took it down?

1235
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,440
Really?

1236
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:12,920
Hold on.

1237
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,080
Yeah.

1238
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,120
I was deleted.

1239
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,440
They deleted the tweet after I quote tweeted.

1240
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,480
Victory.

1241
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:47,480
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh du

1242
00:59:47,480 --> 01:00:17,480
duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

1243
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,640
There was an OMGITSROB2, but there wasn't just an OMGITSROB, and I was like, I'll take it, yoink.

1244
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,440
Somebody-

1245
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,400
Maybe then that means that there was one and it was deleted.

1246
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,200
Probably.

1247
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,240
After that one was made.

1248
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,280
I wish the Rob Roberts account would get deleted so I could get it, but unfortunately, there's me,

1249
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,880
there's apparently some politician in the UK who kind of sounds like an ass,

1250
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:48,120
there's some DJ in Australia, New Zealand, and there is some rugby player.

1251
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,640
All of us named Rob Roberts.

1252
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,720
So it will be a fight to who gets that name first once the spammer disappears.

1253
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,640
Fingers crossed.

1254
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,400
It should be me, damn it.

1255
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,520
I've been on Twitter the longest.

1256
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,880
All right.

1257
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,520
Anyway, moving on.

1258
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,160
I'm sorry, we derailed a long way from a very serious topic, but I do want to re-emphasize,

1259
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,560
speaking of Twitter, check out what's going on with a better Ubisoft and latest updates

1260
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,480
and resign iskimam.

1261
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,040
Let's move on.

1262
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,800
Let's try to get some happy news, Dark Sakura.

1263
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:22,440
So a game called Tetris the Grandmaster is getting a home port.

1264
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,680
And then they said it was going to be delayed.

1265
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:37,240
So they announced the port by announcing that the announcement has been delayed.

1266
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,040
Does that make sense?

1267
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,240
Yes, this game is coming out eventually.

1268
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:50,120
This is the same arcade version from 1998, which was considered one of the best ones

1269
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,960
and is often used for speed runs and competition.

1270
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,640
And of course, there were other sequels like Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus

1271
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,600
and Tetris, the Grandmaster three terror instinct.

1272
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,240
What's terror about Tetris, please?

1273
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:07,740
Thank you.

1274
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:13,340
Um, but this tweet is actually, hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read it.

1275
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:13,840
Okay.

1276
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:20,300
The announcement about the TGM series for home use, which was scheduled for today, has

1277
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,740
not been released yet due to the reasons other than Arika.

1278
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,180
I guess that's the company.

1279
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,820
Yes, company.

1280
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:33,020
In addition, although it is a new TGM work that is under consideration separately, there

1281
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:39,100
is a request from the licenser side that I want you to make the case success as a condition.

1282
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,460
So it is very legitimate.

1283
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,660
It's, it's bad translation.

1284
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,660
But basically it means this is, this is real.

1285
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,460
It is a real game, but we're not supposed to announce it yet.

1286
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,400
Wild.

1287
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,740
I think they just worked around being told not to announce it.

1288
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:55,120
Interesting.

1289
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,580
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I don't know if he'll be at games on quick, but talking to

1290
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,700
our old friend, Kevin.

1291
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,200
Yes.

1292
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,900
One of our listeners who used to go by Kevin DDR.

1293
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,180
I don't think he goes by that anymore.

1294
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:10,540
I think he changed his branding, but, um, he is very well known for doing Tetris at

1295
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,340
games done quick.

1296
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
He listened to this show back in the day.

1297
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,860
I don't know if he still does, but hello, if you're listening, um, and has done some

1298
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,300
very impressive tech, like he did Tetris blindfolded this game.

1299
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,580
If I remember right.

1300
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,820
Well, no, that can't be possible because you have to know what he did.

1301
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,980
There was something wild he did with this game.

1302
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,620
I remember somebody in chat remind me what it was.

1303
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,420
Um, but anyway, the full comment, Dr.

1304
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,100
Tetsuya said is that from talking to our old friend, he's thinking this is a compilation

1305
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,620
of the three, uh, TGM arcade games.

1306
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,820
So it might be like a compilation.

1307
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,860
That'd be really cool.

1308
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,380
Uh, and you know, the switch has been getting a lot of like arcade ports.

1309
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,380
You know, we talked about it again last week.

1310
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,380
Um, the whole series of the.

1311
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,060
Oh my God, what?

1312
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,900
Arcade archives and you know, the console archives and that whole news arcade archives.

1313
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,060
There's been a lot of arcade ports on switch.

1314
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:02,860
Not that this is falling into that same, um, branding, but it is, you know, very interesting.

1315
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,420
Uh, and Dr.

1316
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,860
Tetsuya says he made grand master, which is not an easy feat at all.

1317
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,260
So that's really cool.

1318
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,380
Well, congratulations.

1319
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,780
Um, I I'm I'll check this game out.

1320
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:19,340
Oh, the other thing, um, that is like a neat, uh, apparently Tetris 99 is by that Akira

1321
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,260
company, although they kind of did it in a partnership.

1322
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,780
Arika did this in partnership with, uh, Nintendo, the Tetris 99.

1323
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,580
So a lot of people have already played that style of Tetris.

1324
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,340
But I think, I think it's neat that there's room for all of this Tetris,

1325
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,260
because you can look at Tetris 99.

1326
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,180
You can look at Tetris effect and you can look at Tetris, the grand master and go,

1327
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,860
these are all great Tetris games.

1328
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,700
And then you can look at what gelico did on the PlayStation with that Tetris release and

1329
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,380
go, that is a shit Tetris game.

1330
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,340
But anyway, I digress.

1331
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,140
I don't know if he ever played Tetris on PlayStation.

1332
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,260
It was horrible.

1333
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:52,960
All right.

1334
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,260
I play one Tetris.

1335
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:55,580
Sorry.

1336
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,060
Two Tetris is two, two only to Tetra.

1337
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,020
Tetris sees.

1338
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,500
I don't know what the, the plural would be.

1339
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,220
What are the two?

1340
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,980
It's the nest one and the game boy win.

1341
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,220
Yep.

1342
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,420
Those, those are good ones.

1343
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,700
Uh, Tetranet.

1344
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,380
Yeah.

1345
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,500
Tetranet was great.

1346
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,700
I miss Tetranet.

1347
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,260
Yeah.

1348
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,100
It was a little throwback to Tetranet.

1349
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,180
I don't know how much of that exists.

1350
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,940
We need a Tetranet stream.

1351
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:21,420
Oh my God.

1352
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,620
Is Tetranet still a thing?

1353
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,260
I have no idea.

1354
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,760
Okay.

1355
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,140
Maybe I I'm going to put my foot in my mouth, but I'm saying it anyway.

1356
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,640
Next.

1357
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,660
O L R or I'm sorry.

1358
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,540
Next vog point redeem thing.

1359
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,420
Tetranet night.

1360
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,220
I'm so in for that.

1361
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:40,780
Dark soccer.

1362
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,980
Would you do a Tetranet night?

1363
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,420
If I can get it to run on this for sure.

1364
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,460
If we can play it.

1365
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,180
Sure.

1366
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:47,500
All right.

1367
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:48,860
All right.

1368
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:49,420
Moving on.

1369
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,260
Uh, let's go onto our next story.

1370
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:51,760
Loki.

1371
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,180
Yeah.

1372
01:05:53,180 --> 01:06:00,460
So apparently there was some game that's being developed by, uh, the folks behind,

1373
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,180
uh, the mafia three series.

1374
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:11,660
And so hanger 13 was working on this ambitious, I guess, new IP for take two.

1375
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:15,340
And fortunately it's been canceled.

1376
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:21,980
So hanger 13's latest project, um, when they pursue new intellectual properties,

1377
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,580
we occasionally may encounter situations that call for cancellation.

1378
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,020
We encourage our teams to pursue their passions and take creative risks,

1379
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,700
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1380
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,980
Um, they didn't do it.

1381
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,820
So, uh, not sure what it was going to be.

1382
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:41,020
The game went by a code name volt or Voltron.

1383
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:46,940
So, um, maybe something similar to like Anthem, something like that.

1384
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,940
Maybe we can speculate all day, but I'll tell you what we'll do.

1385
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:58,300
We'll just wait a good five, 10 years or so when somehow a working build of this game

1386
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:02,620
leaks out into the public, you know, and we'll figure it out then.

1387
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:04,620
Kitty.

1388
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,540
It's a midnight.

1389
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:11,660
Oh, I have grabbed her against her will.

1390
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,140
What do you have to say about that boo?

1391
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,740
Smoosh never comes in here during the show.

1392
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,180
I guess he just yells at you from across the house.

1393
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:21,660
He did.

1394
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:26,140
When we were all in person, he would, because he was like, oh, new people.

1395
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,500
Oh, anti Jamie, you know, he would do, he would do those types of things.

1396
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:29,900
Yeah.

1397
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,460
So, but now it's just like, oh, I see that guy all the time.

1398
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,900
I'm not going to go over there.

1399
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:39,100
So anyway, we have a cat in the neighborhood named blue.

1400
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,180
She is a gray short-haired cat.

1401
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,660
She now knows that I work from home.

1402
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,260
And if we leave the door, the front door, we have a screen door in the front door.

1403
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:55,260
Or if I leave the side door open in the kitchen here, she will come up and meow at the door

1404
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,260
for me to come outside to pet her belly.

1405
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:03,180
Oh, and today she tried to run into the house when I was going back inside.

1406
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:06,780
I'm like, nope, you can't go in there.

1407
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,740
Congratulations.

1408
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,620
You have another cat.

1409
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,020
I know.

1410
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,140
I don't know whose cat it is.

1411
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,780
It's one of the, so one of the neighbor's cats.

1412
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,140
She always smells like, uh, like laundry.

1413
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,820
She always smells like laundry sheets.

1414
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:23,660
And I'm not sure if that's like, uh, there are worse things a cat can smell like.

1415
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,900
No, I bet she's cuddling up against a dryer because it's warm.

1416
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,500
I think that might be a serious answer.

1417
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,100
Maybe.

1418
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,780
I don't know, but she's one of the neighbor's cats.

1419
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,220
Knock it off.

1420
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:40,140
Um, I, I found a kitty friend when I was doing, um, a walk recently during Pikmin at the park

1421
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,900
and I was afraid I was going to make the Loki mistake.

1422
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,420
I was petting the kitty and it's adorable, but no collar.

1423
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,140
I couldn't see that the ear was chipped or anything like that.

1424
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:52,060
And I'm like, oh God, this is probably a neighborhood cat, but like very friendly to

1425
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:52,460
humans.

1426
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,620
Most ferrules kind of hiss at the humans.

1427
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,660
They don't really come up to a real feral.

1428
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,300
We'll do that.

1429
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,700
Um, a lot of people though, there's a lot of assholes out there, especially now in this

1430
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,420
period that have adopted COVID pets and abandoned them.

1431
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,260
And you know what those people are?

1432
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:10,700
They're shit.

1433
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,220
Anyway, we digressed.

1434
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,140
It's always back to cats, but that's why, but we digress from the big budget game that

1435
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,700
got canceled.

1436
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,700
So this is a $53 million project.

1437
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,500
Take two canceled.

1438
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,300
Yeah, that is.

1439
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,400
Wow.

1440
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:30,060
You know, I, you know what I'm reminded of funny enough, blizzard, blizzard cancel.

1441
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
And I can't remember the name of the game.

1442
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,220
Now somebody in chat might remember it was a pro.

1443
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,740
Well, they never announced the game.

1444
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,420
It was always project.

1445
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,060
It was project Atlas.

1446
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:45,180
I don't, I don't remember the name of it, but it was like, it was a huge thing that they

1447
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,220
were undertaking.

1448
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:53,900
Well, the point is Overwatch was born of that because it was supposed to be, I guess I,

1449
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:58,220
they never really said what it was all about, but it was some type of like MMO type of thing

1450
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:03,580
where like you would go into these combat areas and the combats were Overwatch.

1451
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,540
And so what they did, they built that out into its own game.

1452
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,860
And a lot of the characters in the original Overwatch were supposed to be for that.

1453
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,100
Thank you, tiger client is Titan was the name of it.

1454
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:13,980
It was project Titan.

1455
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,300
Ah, yeah, that is it Titan.

1456
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,620
And a lot of those characters that were, especially in the original Overwatch were from that project

1457
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,500
Titan game.

1458
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,220
So my point is because I'm sitting here going, well, that's $53 million down the fucking

1459
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:26,940
drain, right?

1460
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:30,540
You gotta be pissed off if you're a shareholder or you're somebody that's, you know, on the

1461
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:35,660
board of this company, but maybe there's a way they can reuse some of what they built

1462
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,540
in something else.

1463
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,020
It just depends on what it is, which of course we don't know.

1464
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,220
There's rumors yet.

1465
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:40,460
No.

1466
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,980
What are they going to work on?

1467
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,100
Oh, I'm sure something else is lined up.

1468
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,060
Grand Theft Auto six.

1469
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,660
We need people to help.

1470
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,860
Oh, well, Grand Theft Auto remaster, uh, Chinatown wars remaster.

1471
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,300
What, what haven't they remastered yet?

1472
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:56,620
Loki.

1473
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,500
That's what they're going to work on.

1474
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,100
So anyway, every master bully, everybody wants a bully remaster or a bully sequel.

1475
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:12,940
That's not a terrible idea, but who knows?

1476
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,060
I guess anything's possible, but they're, they'll probably play a coaster test.

1477
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:20,300
It'll probably be like the Titan thing where we won't really figure it out until a couple

1478
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:26,140
years later when either the derivative game comes out or a former employee eventually

1479
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:31,500
squeals because they figure the, um, uh, the NDA doesn't apply to them anymore, even

1480
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,260
though it technically does.

1481
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,980
But, you know, people will squeal eventually.

1482
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,260
It just might be a few years.

1483
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,980
So, all right, moving on.

1484
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,980
You got to love this headline.

1485
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,300
Bowser pleads guilty.

1486
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,260
Uh, and, uh, that's exactly what's going on.

1487
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,460
Is that time?

1488
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:48,700
Yep.

1489
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,020
That's right.

1490
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:50,460
They caught him.

1491
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,460
They, they got him gals.

1492
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:52,860
All right.

1493
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:59,020
You've been arrested for 83 chart or you're being charged with 83 counts of kidnapping,

1494
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:05,740
false imprisonment, setting fire in places where it shouldn't be.

1495
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,940
All right, look, uh, I am not talking about Bowser, the villain and Mario.

1496
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,540
I am not talking about Doug Bowser.

1497
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:20,220
I am talking about Gary Bowser, who was in the news, uh, previously as part of team executor.

1498
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,300
Doesn't that sound like a very Bowser sounding name?

1499
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,020
It was a hack.

1500
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,620
I have purchased so many of their products and I'm very disappointed.

1501
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,780
That was selling software and heart.

1502
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:33,660
I don't think you should admit that Logie, uh, software allegedly, it was research purposes.

1503
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,220
It was, uh, research.

1504
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:42,620
Well, I don't have it anymore because, or maybe I don't remember, but, um, it was, I

1505
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:48,140
had a, a chipped, um, we, to be able to, um, mod stuff with that.

1506
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:51,820
And then, um, never could mod anything with it too.

1507
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,060
And then eventually they had like easier things you don't even need.

1508
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,620
I was going to say, I didn't have a chip.

1509
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:02,060
Uh, the Xbox 360 also, they did a lot of, um, repair kits.

1510
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,220
I had gone through a lot of their repair kits for the rhetoric at death type stuff.

1511
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:09,980
So that was another thing that I perused them from.

1512
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,420
Or, and I think an actual, like, uh, I don't know.

1513
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,940
I bought lots of things.

1514
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:20,380
Well, anyway, team X executor, uh, believed that they were advocating for homebrew programs

1515
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:26,220
and a consumer's right to repair their own property, which in that regard points are

1516
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:26,780
made.

1517
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:31,500
Um, however, the Japanese, uh, company Nintendo teamed up with the U S government.

1518
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,620
And, uh, so you got many nations involved in, uh, uh, bringing charges against Gary

1519
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,860
Bowser and team, uh, executor.

1520
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:45,740
And, um, the court documents called them a criminal criminal enterprise that was over

1521
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,460
a dozen individual members located around the world.

1522
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:53,340
And, uh, eventually they, uh, pleaded guilty.

1523
01:13:53,340 --> 01:14:00,700
So you have 48 year old French national max Lauren and 51, uh, Canadian man, Gary Bowser,

1524
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:04,780
who were arrested and, uh, Bowser was in the Dominican Republic.

1525
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:09,580
So surely you're following all the rules when you've fled to another country that, you know,

1526
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:14,380
is much smaller, but anyway, uh, he's been extradited to the United States and that's

1527
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,100
where he's been.

1528
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:21,260
And yeah, I'm glad we're going after these large criminals that clearly caused Nintendo

1529
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,260
so much loss in money.

1530
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:28,700
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to circumvent technological measures and trafficking and

1531
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:33,900
circumvention devices, which both carry maximum prison sentences of five years.

1532
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,340
Although I would imagine if he pled guilty, he will not get that maximum sentence.

1533
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,500
He's probably hoping for something like probation.

1534
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,540
So we will see.

1535
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:47,340
Um, let's see the FBI Raymond Duda of the FBI was quoted saying, imagine if something

1536
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,940
you invented was stolen from you and then marketed and sold to customers around the

1537
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,420
world.

1538
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:55,820
That's exactly exactly what team ex executor was doing.

1539
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,980
This is a perfect example of why the FBI has made the prevention of theft and intellectual

1540
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,580
property a priority.

1541
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:06,300
These arrests should send a message to would be pirates that the FBI does not consider

1542
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,660
these crimes to be a game.

1543
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,660
I feel like that should be said.

1544
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,860
That's the FBI logo on a splash screen.

1545
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,260
Thank you.

1546
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:13,660
Thank you.

1547
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:19,340
Boomers for like, uh, that, that wonderful, you know, no, no, it wasn't, his name wasn't

1548
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:19,740
boomer.

1549
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,900
It was Duda, I think, or I closed the window already.

1550
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,660
Um, it's just, it's so stupid though.

1551
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,140
Like seriously, like I get it like, yeah, mod chips and stuff, but like you could go

1552
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,460
back to like even like PlayStation and stuff like that.

1553
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:32,700
Yeah.

1554
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:38,780
There's their mod chips that they had out there that you could hire a game and run it

1555
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:43,020
on there, but you can also use it to play stuff from other regions.

1556
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,940
Or although I think that, you know, honestly though, I think the systems are region free

1557
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,180
for at least like some of the more modern systems, but there are other applications

1558
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,780
playing modded games.

1559
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,460
For example, I did a lot of modded grand theft auto.

1560
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,980
I didn't necessarily have, um, executed products when it came to running that stuff.

1561
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:07,420
That was just, you know, hard drive or a district flashes, but you know, we played a lot of

1562
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,620
modded stuff with it and no harm to other people.

1563
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:17,100
Cause I owned like, you know, my copy of grand theft auto four at the time, but I don't

1564
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,260
know.

1565
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,820
I think it's stupid to go after these mod chip creators.

1566
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,820
It's not like it's destroying this console.

1567
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:28,940
I think it's a whole different situation now than like, say it was a long time ago.

1568
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,220
So I think now it's just really easy and convenient to buy games.

1569
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,140
Yep.

1570
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:34,620
I don't know.

1571
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,460
All right.

1572
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:42,700
Or I mean, or let's put it this way now, like they're almost out of the market anyways,

1573
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,780
because it probably even easier to emulate some of these systems before it is to, you

1574
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:49,820
know, like we talked about like the switch emulation and stuff like that.

1575
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:54,940
It's like, well, Oh, darn, I can't, you know, I can't mod my switch now.

1576
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:59,020
I guess I'll just have to emulate it on PC instead and get around all of those problems.

1577
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,180
All right.

1578
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:01,660
Stupid.

1579
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,100
Let's move on.

1580
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,020
Like they're built, creating this circumstance all on their own.

1581
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,620
And it's also Nintendo.

1582
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:12,140
It's just Nintendo is just the wrong take on so many things.

1583
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:13,980
All right.

1584
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:18,940
Let's move on to another sort of mod and questionable usage of IP, right?

1585
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,580
Dark soccer.

1586
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,380
I guess it's more parodying.

1587
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,900
Defend this in just a second.

1588
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,500
Let dark soccer talk about our next story.

1589
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,140
Next story.

1590
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,460
Oh, nevermind.

1591
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,580
Cause I forgot to bring it up.

1592
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,300
That was my bad.

1593
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,340
So there is a clone out there.

1594
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,260
No, this actually, okay, there we go.

1595
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:41,660
Sorry.

1596
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,580
For some reason it kept opening the wrong article.

1597
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:54,860
There is a game out there that is a clone based off of squid game.

1598
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,580
It's legally distinct.

1599
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,580
It is legally distinct.

1600
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,460
It is inspired by it.

1601
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,180
I should say an offered up for free on steam.

1602
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,540
It's called crab game.

1603
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:16,540
And it has like different, the different childhood games where you have to basically

1604
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,620
do them or die or do them well and die or die.

1605
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,140
Like the floor is lava or red light, green light.

1606
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,260
And I don't know how to feel about this, but I want it.

1607
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,660
Loki clearly has feelings.

1608
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:38,540
This is created by a guy that goes by Danny on, uh, he's a YouTuber and unity developer.

1609
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,340
And he's been making games for a very long time.

1610
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,020
He's very entertaining to watch.

1611
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,060
He has another game out.

1612
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,020
That's very popular on steam right now called muck, which is kind of a.

1613
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:53,500
Survival type game, not, not in Minecraft per se, but it's just like a survival game.

1614
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,940
It's just ridiculous.

1615
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,940
But this, yeah, obviously it is definitely based on

1616
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:06,460
the gameplay of say squid game, but he's taken it to like another level where he's added a

1617
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,940
bunch of unique games into it as well.

1618
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:15,740
And, um, different spins on the games that were in the actual show.

1619
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:21,100
And I'm saying, I'm saying a lot of this, a lot of my talk is very tongue in cheek because

1620
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,260
I mean the squid game stuff and you're right.

1621
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,660
It's all based on childhood games anyway.

1622
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,300
So a lot of this stuff is showing up everywhere.

1623
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
Ironically back on in childhood.

1624
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,980
So when kids really shouldn't be watching squid game, but I get, of course they are

1625
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,620
anyway.

1626
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,460
And so they're playing Roblox and stuff.

1627
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,500
Who does their job anymore?

1628
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:37,740
Right?

1629
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,060
Yeah.

1630
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,820
Who is supposed to be a babysitter?

1631
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:40,620
Who cares?

1632
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:40,940
Yeah.

1633
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:45,020
So they're playing red light, green light, but I guess when they lose, they get shot

1634
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,140
with a nerf gun or something.

1635
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,380
I don't know, but that's what kids do on playgrounds now.

1636
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,220
So it is, it's not surprising that of course it makes its way to video games, of course.

1637
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,740
And again, it's a, I mean, it's basically fall guys, right?

1638
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,860
I mean, fog and fall guys was before the squid game phenomenon.

1639
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,500
Isn't that basically the same thing in a way?

1640
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,100
I mean, obviously no.

1641
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,340
Yes, the games are different, but not that different.

1642
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,380
Yeah.

1643
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,180
It's kind of fun.

1644
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,340
I think it's really popular because it's free.

1645
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,860
Um, true.

1646
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,460
Honestly.

1647
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,620
Well, he kind of expanded it in the way, like he wanted to take other, like if squid game

1648
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,300
were made in the U S type of thing.

1649
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:25,340
So he has a bunch of like, you know, us games like tag or they have like hide and seek bomb

1650
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:30,620
tags on a thing, but like, they have a game that's sort of like not necessarily splatoon,

1651
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:34,940
but it's kind of like, you know, you have to touch panels on the wall and the floor

1652
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:36,220
and they change to your color.

1653
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,500
And, um, of course then there's the red, like green.

1654
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:44,140
Let me tell you, let me tell you a game dark soccer and I never shut up about dead by daylight

1655
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,620
is basically hide and seek and I'm terrible at it.

1656
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:53,420
So it's a little bit more involved, but yeah, it does have some tags, especially the way

1657
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,500
these, especially the way people playing it today.

1658
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,660
My God, it has some tag elements.

1659
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,100
Yeah.

1660
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,620
So it looks fun.

1661
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:05,740
It's also, you know, it's, it's popular because, you know, we have everybody streaming it now

1662
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,860
cause everybody wants to get on that like squid game hype.

1663
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,580
And now there's like a free to play game that kind of captures that.

1664
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,260
So everybody's just, I mean, everybody's doing squid game stuff now.

1665
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,460
It's just, that's, what's popular.

1666
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:23,260
They just did a big thing with the Minecraft, uh, Minecraft streamers, like 200, you know,

1667
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,940
streamers and stuff.

1668
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,740
And they were doing a squid game in Minecraft.

1669
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:29,340
And then they have the crab game stuff.

1670
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,220
You have dream.

1671
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,100
Who's a Minecraft streamer also playing crab game.

1672
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:33,980
Just like it.

1673
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:37,260
It's just insanely popular and it's free to play.

1674
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,380
So poor Danny's not getting any, any cash though, from it.

1675
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,980
Make sure you go wishlist, uh, Carlson instead.

1676
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:48,140
His, his actual paid game, put ads in that game, buddy, make that coin.

1677
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:48,780
You earned it.

1678
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:54,860
So ma well, maybe he's worried about Netflix, but it's, it sounds like it's super derivative

1679
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,740
enough that it's not, not even close.

1680
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,820
There was that story tonight, uh, on Bobby's show, or at least I remember him referencing

1681
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:06,220
it about that squid game thing that had the NFTs that they were selling like NFTs, the

1682
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:06,460
carrot.

1683
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,300
Now that is some bullshittery.

1684
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,580
And that's the type of stuff that, you know, it did get shut down.

1685
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:14,060
Didn't they, didn't they steal like $3 million?

1686
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:14,940
They rug pulled.

1687
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:15,180
Yeah.

1688
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,180
That's the thing with, and it's not NFTs.

1689
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,540
It's like a crypto coin.

1690
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:24,700
So these like, um, trash coins or whatever that you will, if, if you hear about these

1691
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:28,300
new cryptos, it's like, and they, it's more times than not.

1692
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:32,540
It's just rug pulls where you get a bunch of people hyped up and you get them invested

1693
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:32,780
in it.

1694
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,380
And then the person that creates the coin takes all the money and leaves, and then the

1695
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,260
coins worth them.

1696
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:42,700
If those D bags can take 3.4 million from squid game fans, then what's the guy's name

1697
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,980
that created this crab game?

1698
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,140
Danny, Danny, Danny.

1699
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:51,580
He's can put some quick five, five second, 10 second ads in his game and make that coin.

1700
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,140
He deserves it.

1701
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,500
He really should.

1702
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,460
And also play mock.

1703
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,900
Mock is really fun too.

1704
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,500
It's also insanely hard.

1705
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:57,820
All right.

1706
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,060
You got a lot of great games, actually.

1707
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,900
DJ says the squid game memes are hilarious.

1708
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:09,660
A lot of them are, but, um, yeah, I mean, I guess it was this game, a meme of some sort,

1709
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:09,980
maybe.

1710
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:10,860
I don't know.

1711
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:11,180
All right.

1712
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:14,940
Well, a lot of the game has memes from his other games as well.

1713
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:17,660
Like there's a whole bunch of watches.

1714
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:22,300
You have to like, like the red light, green light person, the model that they created

1715
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,420
has his face on it.

1716
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,340
It's just like stretched.

1717
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,540
It just looks weird.

1718
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,420
But like, it's, it's just silly and it's free.

1719
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,820
It's just fun.

1720
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,460
I don't know.

1721
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,180
I'll check it out.

1722
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:34,540
Let's move on.

1723
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,060
Who's got our next story?

1724
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,560
Logie?

1725
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Yeah, so this is really cool, actually.

1726
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:44,300
So there's a brand new feature that's coming to Forza Horizon 5.

1727
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:52,700
That adds actual ASL and BSL sign language support to the cinematic.

1728
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:58,860
So you actually have an interpreter on screen during the cinematics signing all of the dialogue

1729
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:03,260
in there now, whereas some folks may use like, you know, closed captioning or something like

1730
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:03,760
that.

1731
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:14,380
People that may also not be able to hear and also maybe like, you know, dyslexic or whatever

1732
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:19,420
the case may be, might not be able to read captions that easily.

1733
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:26,140
And, you know, the sign language interpreter is much easier to, to understand.

1734
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:31,580
So I think that's just like, it's extremely cool that they put that in this game and just

1735
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:34,060
the accessibility features are, are insane.

1736
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:39,660
This, this is the kind of shit when they talk about cloud gaming and things that are in

1737
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:40,700
the cloud.

1738
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,980
This is the kind of shit I would love to see the cloud used for.

1739
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:48,940
Is that when somebody would like to have, you know, ASL, I'm assuming, I know ASL is American

1740
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,340
sign language.

1741
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:50,620
I'm assuming BSL is British.

1742
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,700
But please correct me if I'm wrong.

1743
01:24:55,580 --> 01:25:00,860
But I think it'd be awesome if more games had the ability to, you know, I get it.

1744
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,220
It's a lot of data.

1745
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,780
They might not be able to fit it all on the disk or in the download or whatever.

1746
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,820
But if somebody could like connect to the cloud and get some of these interpretations,

1747
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,860
I think that's awesome.

1748
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:13,820
And yeah, you brought up the great points about why captions are good in one way, but

1749
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,940
sign language is even better for other sorts.

1750
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:20,140
There's also emotion and things that you can convey.

1751
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:23,420
Yes, that you can convey in sign language that you can't necessarily convey in the written

1752
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,060
words.

1753
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:30,220
If you want to see what I'm talking about and folks that can hear will absolutely notice

1754
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:30,780
this as well.

1755
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:35,340
Go look at somebody sign languaging a rap concert.

1756
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,100
These videos go viral once in a while.

1757
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,180
I'm sure they've got to be all over TikTok.

1758
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:47,580
I actually want to interject on this one because my uncle is an interpreter and I know a little

1759
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:48,080
ASL.

1760
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:53,500
Part of actually speaking sign language is facial expression.

1761
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:58,620
It is an integral part of sign language.

1762
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:06,300
You have to cultivate certain emotions for certain things that, you know, facial responses

1763
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,860
to convey the right terms across.

1764
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:12,300
And don't forget, there are also different dialects of ASL.

1765
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:24,700
And so it is a lot going into it, but having the face to go with it is absolutely essential

1766
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,780
to proper communication in ASL.

1767
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:32,140
Yeah, so I don't think anyone looks at this and sees it as a bad thing.

1768
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,220
I think some people have that curiosity.

1769
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,580
Well, don't they have closed captioning?

1770
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,620
But now we've explained it.

1771
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:40,460
There's a very big difference between the two with the emotion and everything.

1772
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:46,140
And again, Google somebody signing in a rap concert or look it up on TikTok.

1773
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,220
Share one in chat if you got a good one and you will see exactly what we're talking about.

1774
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,860
There's a reason those videos go viral all the time.

1775
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,260
All right, let's move on.

1776
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:55,980
I don't know.

1777
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,540
It's interesting.

1778
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,380
I'm doing this story, not dark soccer, but that's okay.

1779
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,420
We'll talk about Google Stadia.

1780
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,780
And the reason I actually had clicked on that because the moment I saw Stadia, I thought

1781
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,280
it was mine.

1782
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,860
No, no, it wasn't.

1783
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:05,900
It wasn't in your pool.

1784
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,780
So I took it out of your pool.

1785
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,260
I should have given it to you as that other one, but that's all right.

1786
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:14,140
Anyway, what I wanted to talk about with this is that, well, you can comment to your heart's

1787
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:14,780
content, please.

1788
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:15,580
It's a collaborative show.

1789
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:21,820
Google Stadia did start doing free trials back in October, and they're going to be adding

1790
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,060
more.

1791
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,740
And when I say free trials, this means you don't have to have Stadia Pro for this.

1792
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:31,740
You can be a free Stadia user and you can actually get two more games you can test drive.

1793
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:37,100
Control Ultimate Edition, which of course that one game of the year things up the wazoo.

1794
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,860
And that is a freebie on Stadia Pro, just saying.

1795
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:41,180
Right.

1796
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:44,060
But even if you don't have Stadia Pro, you can still test run it.

1797
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,740
Well, no, I'm just saying the difference is that as opposed to a trial without Stadia

1798
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,060
Pro on Stadia Pro, they were giving it away for free.

1799
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:50,560
Nice.

1800
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:56,460
And then I believe Hello Engineer is the other one that they're doing.

1801
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:56,860
Am I?

1802
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:57,740
No, no.

1803
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,660
Hello Engineer was the first one they did.

1804
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:03,420
And then I'm sorry, the other game is Riders Republic from Ubisoft.

1805
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,940
So that's pretty neat.

1806
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,940
And the Resident Evil Village one is still up too.

1807
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,300
Oh, cool.

1808
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:09,500
Yeah.

1809
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,860
Last I checked, I can't actually look at my phone.

1810
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,820
And if I launch Stadia right now, Dead by Daylight will come up.

1811
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,940
But yeah.

1812
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:25,020
So if you're curious about Stadia, you know, and you want to take it for a test drive,

1813
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:28,620
you have plenty of ways to do that now with these free trials and so forth.

1814
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,700
If you're curious, how does the cloud gaming work?

1815
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,340
I should say Microsoft's gotten more and more in this too.

1816
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,900
You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week, because I didn't play enough

1817
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:41,020
of it, but I started up the Marvel Avengers game in the cloud because you know, that game

1818
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:42,140
is like 100 gig download.

1819
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,540
I'm like, I don't have the bandwidth for that, but I want to try this.

1820
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,780
So I started to do that first little area.

1821
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,780
If you've played the Avengers game, you know what I'm talking about?

1822
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:52,060
That first little Avenger, how do they call it?

1823
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,580
Like the celebration.

1824
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,220
It was half price on Steam, but still full price on Stadia.

1825
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,360
Yeah.

1826
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,140
So, but, but on the, um, it's on game pass, Microsoft, you can play it on the cloud through

1827
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,540
Microsoft game pass on your console.

1828
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,660
Now that's the big deal.

1829
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:10,780
I'd already done cloud gaming on my PC, but this was me playing the adventures on my TV

1830
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,820
and it wasn't bad at all.

1831
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,740
Again, it was like watching a YouTube.

1832
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,820
You see a little bit of, uh, you know, like kind of artifact ingraininess that you would

1833
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,460
see on a YouTube, but it wasn't terrible by any means.

1834
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,980
Um, certainly better than spending the a hundred gigs to download it, to take it for a test

1835
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:24,620
drive.

1836
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:27,340
So maybe cloud gaming really is the future.

1837
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:31,980
You know, I feel like I'm, you know, integrating it more and more and getting, you know, it's

1838
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,380
great for taking things for a test spin and so forth.

1839
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,980
Certainly what dark soccer is doing is, is a great test case for it as well.

1840
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,740
There's, I think we're going to see the cloud thing more and more honestly, in the, um,

1841
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:45,100
you know, coming years, another quick little update with Stadia.

1842
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,420
Uh, you can actually jump into friends games now.

1843
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:53,340
Um, so, uh, for example, far cry six is one of them.

1844
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:59,020
Uh, you can actually go right into, um, somebody else's current game, but somebody does have

1845
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,940
to enable their privacy settings for that.

1846
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,540
Of course you can imagine why.

1847
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:06,220
So if you go into your privacy tab of Stadia and in the current game, there's an option

1848
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,580
that says, join your current game.

1849
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:11,900
And if you enable that, then somebody can join your game unannounced, which some people

1850
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,300
would love.

1851
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,340
Some people would hate.

1852
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:14,460
So you can pick that.

1853
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:18,540
You can also, of course, set it to friends, um, and all players.

1854
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,580
I don't know why you'd do that.

1855
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,060
I guess if you really want to do something multiplayer, you could.

1856
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,580
Um, so that's kind of neat.

1857
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:28,700
Um, it's also what you would expect on some of the other services like Xbox live and PlayStation.

1858
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:32,700
So it is nice that Stadia has got that now in the cloud, um, section as well.

1859
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,460
So good for them.

1860
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,980
All right, now we're going to get into, forget this cloud gaming stuff.

1861
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:43,500
We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no cloud.

1862
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,220
It was all on a disc in our next segment.

1863
01:30:52,060 --> 01:31:03,580
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1864
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,900
out a classic and tell you about it.

1865
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1866
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:15,580
And once a month, dark soccer instead picks a fucking weird arcade game, but I think everyone

1867
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,540
knows this one.

1868
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,660
At least I hope they do.

1869
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,260
And this is an amazing pick.

1870
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:19,820
Dark soccer.

1871
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:20,940
What is the flag tonight?

1872
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:27,420
Okay, so it is a game that a lot of people know, but it was really freaking weird when

1873
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:27,980
it came out.

1874
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,940
So it's part of it.

1875
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,220
Don't get me wrong.

1876
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:39,740
So it's the typing of the dead, which was funny when I was pulling up the video for

1877
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:39,900
it.

1878
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:44,220
I hear from the other room, are you playing the house of the dead?

1879
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:50,060
No, but it was funny because Dan does like recognize the music from like the first two

1880
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:50,560
bars.

1881
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:56,220
Typing of the Dead was an arcade game that was developed by Wow Entertainment, published

1882
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,220
by Sega for the NAOMI hardware.

1883
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:05,660
It came out in 1999 in Japan and then had a port to Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit.

1884
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:12,300
There was another version for Windows that came out in 2000 in the PS2 port in 2004.

1885
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:19,660
So this is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun game.

1886
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:24,940
The House of the Dead 2, where instead of a gun, you have a keyboard.

1887
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:33,980
And so you type to kill your enemies and, you know, typing faster is better.

1888
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:37,340
You know, you've got to type before the enemy is going to attack you.

1889
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:41,660
And it's really, really cool.

1890
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:47,740
It was actually considered a form of edutainment when it came out, and a lot of critics actually

1891
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,580
said, hey, this is great.

1892
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:50,860
It's funny.

1893
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,140
It can be difficult.

1894
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,020
It's original.

1895
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:59,900
The PC version of Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003.

1896
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:07,020
The PS2 port was called Typing of the Dead Zombicanic, and it was released in Japan December

1897
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,580
2004, and it came with USB keyboard.

1898
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,500
There was Typing of the Dead 2 that came out in Japan.

1899
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:18,540
English of the Dead, which was a revision for House of the Dead 2, was also released

1900
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,540
to learn as a language learning game in Japan for the Nintendo DS.

1901
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:27,340
And then there's an iOS remake that was called Flick of the Dead.

1902
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,300
And then it was, of course, Typing of the Dead Overkill, which was based on House of

1903
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:36,380
the Dead Overkill, came out for Windows in October 2015.

1904
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:38,380
And we have the distinction of having a text pack.

1905
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:44,460
These are special, and awesome, and educational.

1906
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,500
Anyway, so it is just House of the Dead 2.

1907
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,940
It's, you know, rail shooter.

1908
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,140
You just type text shit.

1909
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,900
You can actually play the Japanese version fairly easily.

1910
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:05,340
I don't think it has too many non-English characters in it.

1911
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:11,500
But the thing I need to point out, and this is why I'm bringing this one up, is that it

1912
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:16,380
is not the only keyboard game that's been out.

1913
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,220
I mean, we have...

1914
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:24,220
There was the one that was the loop on the third, the typing.

1915
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,140
Oh, yeah.

1916
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,580
I think I've never seen that once.

1917
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,500
Yeah, which is actually what I almost picked.

1918
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,140
And it's another Sega game.

1919
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:39,660
It was developed by WoW, as well, published on the NAOMI system.

1920
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:44,220
So it was based off of Loop in the Third, the shooting that came out the year before

1921
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:44,720
that.

1922
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:50,700
So there are just a variety of, you know...

1923
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,940
I think there's another one.

1924
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:55,820
There was...

1925
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,500
Can I say really quick while you're while you're brainstorming?

1926
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,260
Neon Ships was, I think, one.

1927
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:10,140
Bobby Black Wolf in chat reminds, and I was going to bring this up, I promise.

1928
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:14,860
I was going to Dark Soccer get to the segment, but a reminder that for the Steam version

1929
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,740
of the game, because again, this game is incredible.

1930
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,540
Check it out.

1931
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,660
But there's the OLR mod.

1932
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,460
It's an official Steam mod that I put out.

1933
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:25,900
I want to say Episode 6.

1934
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:27,020
You did mention that.

1935
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:27,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

1936
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,540
Which I talked about.

1937
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,100
I'm sorry.

1938
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,420
I went AFK to the potty and I caught up on chat.

1939
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:31,920
Sorry.

1940
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,120
It's okay.

1941
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:38,540
Well, I didn't say specifically Steam, but I did say it was the Windows version.

1942
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,040
Gotcha.

1943
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,020
But there we go.

1944
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:50,540
And of course, it's got three different endings based on how you answer the questions that

1945
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:51,740
the Emperor asks.

1946
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:56,460
You have the explosion ending where you defeat the Emperor.

1947
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:01,580
You see Goldman falling off of a building, and then there's an explosion when he hits

1948
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:05,740
the ground and you have to type honest answers to questions during the boss fight.

1949
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,260
So that's how you get that one.

1950
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:15,180
There's the bungee ending where if you do untruthful or strange answers during the boss

1951
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:22,220
fight, then you get a bungee cord attached to Goldman's leg, and he returns to where

1952
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,740
he came from and burps.

1953
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:30,460
And then you have the Superman ending where you have to do untruthful answers only to

1954
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,980
the questions asked in the boss fight.

1955
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:40,460
And instead of him jumping, Goldman jumping off or falling off, he waves to the narrator

1956
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:43,340
and raises his hands and rises into the sky.

1957
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:47,260
And that's it.

1958
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,660
So it got great reviews.

1959
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:52,140
Like I said, Famitsu gave it 35 out of 40.

1960
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:59,180
Everyone thought it was just so absurd that it's just, it was hilarious.

1961
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,540
Game Informer named it the weirdest game of all time.

1962
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:09,020
The graphics have, of course, been criticized because, I mean, it wasn't updated from House

1963
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:17,900
of the Dead 2, and there's actually even PC World said it was a runner up on the top 10

1964
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,940
worst games list.

1965
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,300
What the fuck do they know?

1966
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,580
They don't have sense of the femur.

1967
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:30,220
But yeah, they're probably holding up the new steam release to or I say no, but it's

1968
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:30,780
a few years old.

1969
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,500
They're holding that up to, like, new guidelines.

1970
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,660
And I think they're probably looking at it through the wrong.

1971
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:40,940
This is 2014 still when it was ranked as one of the worst.

1972
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:42,300
Yeah.

1973
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,700
So that wasn't that the year that it came out on steam?

1974
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,900
I don't know.

1975
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:59,420
But even so, I mean, they said they didn't think the concept was that novel.

1976
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,620
Whatever.

1977
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,300
Then go play something else.

1978
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:09,580
I mean, honestly, the House of the Dead, any of the typing of the dead ones, like, they

1979
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:10,800
don't.

1980
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:12,940
They're really fun.

1981
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:19,260
They like, I remember going to Jessica's house and us both having our keyboards.

1982
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:27,340
Two player house typing of the dead and having the best time.

1983
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:30,380
Of course, sometimes there was drinking involved and then we would play drunk and that was

1984
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:30,880
terrible.

1985
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:38,140
But yeah, it's probably up there with one of my favorite games.

1986
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:41,580
But it is definitely a fucking weird arcade game when it came out.

1987
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,620
Absolutely.

1988
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:43,660
Great pick.

1989
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:44,220
There it is.

1990
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,260
Your flag.

1991
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:46,060
Oh, the month.

1992
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:51,980
The typing of the dead, or is our DJ on the chat says this game looks better than the

1993
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:52,480
movie.

1994
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:55,180
Everything looks better.

1995
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,700
Everything looks better than that movie.

1996
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,980
So there you go.

1997
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,860
All right.

1998
01:38:58,860 --> 01:38:59,420
Great pick.

1999
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,260
Great trip down memory lane.

2000
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,060
Great chance to plug the OLR mod that's out there.

2001
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,780
That honestly should go back and update.

2002
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,940
I just I will caution.

2003
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:16,700
A lot of the stuff that's in there is old, like it's old references to the show when

2004
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:20,700
it was a little more wild and we had more people here every week for the show.

2005
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,140
Like, you know, there used to have, you know, we crammed like six people in the studio every

2006
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,340
week and we had all that.

2007
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:30,140
So there's a lot of like old jokes that might not resonate with if you found the show in

2008
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,100
the past five years.

2009
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,540
But I still think it's I think it's neat that we did a mod.

2010
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,540
We should do an updated pack for reasons.

2011
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:40,380
I was going to say we should do an updated one, but I also I'm like, well, what updated

2012
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,260
jokes do we have?

2013
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:47,100
I need the help of some OLR historians to add stuff in there.

2014
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,540
I'm happy to do an update, though.

2015
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:49,740
I think it would be fun.

2016
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:55,260
So and I think Questbuster really sums it up for me in chat over twitch.tv slash vog

2017
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,860
network saying this is one of the reasons I love Sega.

2018
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:02,940
They're willing to take risks like this from time to time, even now.

2019
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,940
So and agree.

2020
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:09,260
That's I think what a lot I mean, just think of all that crazy shit from the late 90s Sega

2021
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:09,980
Dreamcast era.

2022
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,020
Samba de Amigo.

2023
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:15,820
Hello, weird Space Channel five wild crazy taxi.

2024
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:16,700
Crazy.

2025
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:20,140
You know, it's just that's now that stuff.

2026
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:23,580
I don't know if it's just because we're in a certain generation of gamers or what, but

2027
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:29,740
all that stuff is like the peak of gaming in many ways for many of us, I think so.

2028
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,780
She Hulk 10 in chat says, what's flag?

2029
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,900
Flag stands for fucking weird arcade game.

2030
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:38,860
And it's because every month of the week.

2031
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:43,340
Of the of the month, because every of the week of the month.

2032
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,580
But I just do them all the time, but I'll run out.

2033
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,460
They're all weird.

2034
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:52,700
We've been doing a yearly twist since twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen, where Dark Sakura

2035
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,940
mixes it up and once a month she does something different.

2036
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,900
So one year she did classic consoles.

2037
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,300
I think soundtracks was one year.

2038
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,900
There was one other one, I think.

2039
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,380
Oh, peripherals was last year, if I remember right.

2040
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,380
So I did pinballs.

2041
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:07,260
Yeah.

2042
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,340
This this I don't think you did pinballs yet.

2043
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,180
Maybe that's not pinball.

2044
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:11,740
Did you?

2045
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,140
Did you?

2046
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:13,500
Yeah.

2047
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:19,180
OK, time flies because I had to I gave myself a limit that they were anything that was at

2048
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:21,820
the beginning of using the DMD system for scoring.

2049
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,060
Wow.

2050
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:22,700
Yeah, you're right.

2051
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,100
You're right.

2052
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,940
OK, so then this now we're at the this is me.

2053
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:30,060
I know, but it's just like it all blurs together.

2054
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,140
And also, to be fair, you talk about pinball a lot.

2055
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:36,860
OK, it doesn't need its own statement, but I love him.

2056
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:37,260
It's fine.

2057
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:42,940
Who doesn't love the ball so that this year the twist was the fucking weird arcade game

2058
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:45,820
where Dark Sakura would pick a game that was really crazy in arcades.

2059
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:49,900
And, you know, again, I would urge you all to go to the wiki, which is orange lounge

2060
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,980
radio dot fandom dot com.

2061
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:56,300
Now, I think it used to be Wikia, but they want some company bought the other.

2062
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:00,060
So and yeah, as Joe and Matt says, there's only one more flag left.

2063
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:00,620
That's right.

2064
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,140
December is the only month left.

2065
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:07,100
So Dark Sakura will go out with a bang and then got to think of next year's one.

2066
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:10,780
I know some ideas have come up, but we'll let Dark Sakura pick what she wants to do

2067
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,100
as we move into 2022 and the 20th year of the show.

2068
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:21,020
The 20th year in my worst arcade game, what's that?

2069
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,980
I'll do worst game of the month, worst game of the month.

2070
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:27,500
You've picked some stinkers, but I mean, you can do more stinkers.

2071
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,540
I'll think of something.

2072
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:31,100
There's a lot of shitty games out there.

2073
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:31,600
All right.

2074
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,300
Thank you, Orange Right, who sends a link.

2075
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:37,740
And so you can see all the previous classic games and the different themes and all that

2076
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:38,220
stuff.

2077
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:39,020
So there you go.

2078
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,220
All right.

2079
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:41,580
Halo.

2080
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:42,380
OK, Bobby.

2081
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:47,900
Bobby says finally, Halo gets in legit with the worst game of the month.

2082
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:55,020
I'm going to say, remember, I did Halo for a lot of money for my mother and it was legit

2083
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,620
and it was legit.

2084
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,660
If I do another Halo game.

2085
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:11,980
I don't even know, maybe, maybe, maybe something will happen, maybe one of the prizes for like

2086
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:14,940
a subathon or something will be I do Halo two.

2087
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,740
It's got to be a subathon here, though.

2088
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,100
Vogue Network.

2089
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,020
I didn't say I wouldn't do it for myself.

2090
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:22,060
I do it here.

2091
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,500
OK, all right.

2092
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,340
Who do you think I am?

2093
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:28,060
Of course, I would do it on my own.

2094
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,620
Capitalist.

2095
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,860
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

2096
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:32,460
All right, moving on.

2097
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,460
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some things going on in the industry

2098
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,420
rather quickly.

2099
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:40,140
And we will go to, I think, Loki first.

2100
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:48,620
Yeah, so, you know, I've been a big fan of Lego stuff and we were buying most of the

2101
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:49,740
Mario sets.

2102
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:53,740
We've kind of stopped because we got too many of them and my son doesn't want to build the

2103
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:54,700
ones I buy for him.

2104
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:55,660
So there's a lot of them.

2105
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:57,180
There is a lot.

2106
01:43:57,180 --> 01:44:01,580
So as you may remember, Lego Luigi is a thing now.

2107
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,860
He was introduced back in August, I believe.

2108
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:12,220
And now they've got some more Luigi centric sets, including the brand new Luigi's Mansion

2109
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,660
sets that are coming out.

2110
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:19,900
So there's actually one there's a brand new like entryway expansion set that they've got

2111
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,260
for like 40 bucks.

2112
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,900
It looks kind of cool with some of the ghosts from the game.

2113
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:31,660
There is a the lab and Poltergust expansion set, which gives you the actual Poltergust

2114
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:34,220
suit that Luigi can wear.

2115
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:41,660
And as also Professor Egad in there, and then they have a more elaborate set, which is the

2116
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:45,660
haunt and seek expansion set, which is 80 bucks.

2117
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,540
And it's got like a bunch of stuff from like a haunted house in there, including King Boo.

2118
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,500
But pretty elaborate stuff.

2119
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:58,940
Probably won't be buying that, though, but neat.

2120
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,620
I like to see more Mario sets.

2121
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:05,180
And then obviously, that partnership is doing very well for both those companies.

2122
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,300
Yes, yes, yes.

2123
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:12,380
And then also, of course, we've got an update to Super Mario 3D All Stars.

2124
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:16,620
You may remember that was a game that was released back in September of last year.

2125
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:19,500
And then they just continued in March when they.

2126
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:25,820
Decided to roll out their expansion pass for their Nintendo online.

2127
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,700
No, no, no, no, no.

2128
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:28,140
It's a limited celebration.

2129
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:29,020
It's a celebration.

2130
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:33,980
Eventually, the celebration has to read that was driving that.

2131
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:36,380
Eventually, the lights have to go out.

2132
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,620
Eventually, the hors d'oeuvres spoil.

2133
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:41,260
So here's OK.

2134
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:48,380
So to that to to that, this is going to be the most unnecessary expansion ever, but or

2135
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:49,100
update ever.

2136
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:55,100
So Super Mario 3D All Stars is adding Nintendo 64 controller support.

2137
01:45:55,740 --> 01:46:01,100
But you may remember that the Nintendo 64 controller, aside from being impossible to

2138
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:04,540
get right now because it's Nintendo and they don't know how to manage the supply chain,

2139
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:11,820
you could only purchase that if you had the expansion pass through Nintendo online,

2140
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:15,580
which you would have already gotten Mario Super Mario 64.

2141
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:20,300
But hey, if you want to play it again on a copy, you already bought now.

2142
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:23,100
They're letting you do that.

2143
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,300
How generous of them.

2144
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,060
I don't know.

2145
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,020
It's stupid.

2146
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:29,980
It's so stupid.

2147
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:35,980
It's weird to see that get a patch, but I mean, it makes it's nice that they're supporting

2148
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:40,380
it, but like it's the hoops you got to jump through to be able to do that is just stupid.

2149
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:42,060
It's nice, but I don't care.

2150
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:45,260
Like that's that sums me up, I guess.

2151
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,220
All right, Dar Sakura, you've got one for us.

2152
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:49,520
I do.

2153
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:59,280
It looks like that filming for The Last of Us is actually done.

2154
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,520
Neil Druckmann posted, and I'll read this verbatim.

2155
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,360
Alas, my time in Canada has come to an end to the best TV crew in the world.

2156
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,880
Thank you for your incredible work, your passion, and for making me feel so welcome.

2157
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,080
I will miss you terribly.

2158
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,800
Excited to return to Naughty Dog and some warmer weather.

2159
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:27,120
And yeah, he put a picture of a clapboard with The Last of Us on it, and it's the same

2160
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:30,240
font, but red with like a design on it.

2161
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:35,920
And yeah, it might be done filming completely, so we'll see.

2162
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,960
Now to edit it and get all the special effects done.

2163
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,480
So it's still probably going to be a little while, but I think that the bar is pretty

2164
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,600
high for that, but it looks like they've got a good cast.

2165
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,640
So be very curious to see how that turns out for sure.

2166
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,140
Totally.

2167
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Speaking of media, I've got a story for you guys.

2168
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,160
And this trailer, I know, showed up in our Discord over at vognetwork.com

2169
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:00,000
slash Discord because, you know, who doesn't love Neil Patrick Harris?

2170
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,560
And that's why everybody's sharing this movie, right?

2171
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,600
Well, I'm sure that's part of it.

2172
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,280
But the other part is it plays in the Nintendo hardcore.

2173
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,640
So it's a movie coming to HBO Max called 8-Bit Christmas.

2174
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,720
And it's talking about it.

2175
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,160
Look, I'm gonna be honest.

2176
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,520
I watched the trailer.

2177
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:20,800
And to me, it's just completely trying to rip off a Christmas story and get that same

2178
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:21,680
sort of vibe.

2179
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,840
But instead of a BB gun, it's a Nintendo.

2180
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,640
What this has to do with video games, I'm not exactly sure, but I guess we can expect

2181
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,040
to see Nintendo stuff featured in the movie.

2182
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,960
And of course, it's just tugging at our heartstrings because a lot of us look at that and go,

2183
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:39,360
oh, oh, that was me going to my friend's house trying to play the Nintendo and all that stuff.

2184
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:46,320
It would have been a perfect time for them to do some sort of partnership deal to re-release

2185
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,040
the NES Classic Edition, wouldn't you think?

2186
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,080
That's how a smart business person thinks.

2187
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,440
That's how a smart business person thinks.

2188
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,600
But this is Nintendo and they won't do that.

2189
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,240
Anyway, the trailer's all over.

2190
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,080
I'm sure many of you guys have seen it by now.

2191
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,360
It's on HBO Max.

2192
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,560
It has Neil Patrick Harris.

2193
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,440
I will wait to see what my friends think of it.

2194
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:10,560
I'm not exactly in a rush to watch it, but it's not because completely that I'm a bitch.

2195
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:16,640
It's just that I don't, you know, I watch a lot more Twitch and I play a lot more video

2196
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:20,800
games and I really have to be intentional if I'm going to break to watch a movie or

2197
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,680
something like that.

2198
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,800
Tigerclaw does point out that it's based on a book.

2199
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,880
Mike Deff says it's nostalgia bait, but I'll watch because of Neil Patrick Harris.

2200
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,320
And that's where I'm kind of like not going to write it off completely.

2201
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,520
I do love that man.

2202
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,880
So yeah.

2203
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,080
And by the way, did y'all see his Halloween?

2204
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:41,840
Like every year that family goes all out for Halloween and it's amazing.

2205
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,120
It's also those kids are growing up.

2206
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:44,560
Those kids are like 10 or 11 now.

2207
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,120
So they do amazing stuff in the new Matrix movie.

2208
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,160
That's right.

2209
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,560
Yeah, that Matrix movie has a hell of a cast.

2210
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,080
That is a movie I will set aside the time to watch.

2211
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:54,560
Guaranteed.

2212
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,920
I will borrow a friend's HBO Max.

2213
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,240
Actually, I might go to the fucking theater to see it quite honestly.

2214
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,760
I'll see it in the theater.

2215
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,600
Anyway, Tigerclaw says it's based on the book.

2216
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,440
Yes, there is a book on it.

2217
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,040
And so it comes from that.

2218
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,920
So was A Christmas Story, which is the original nostalgia porn.

2219
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,840
I think that ties into this.

2220
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,480
All right, let's move on.

2221
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,480
Travel around the world and check out some releases.

2222
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,680
Actually, no, I lied.

2223
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:25,040
I'm going to insert a story here in Rapid Fire News because we had a really good one

2224
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,280
shared by Bobby in chat.

2225
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,320
And I think this is worth sharing.

2226
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,680
I should save this for last minute stories, but I'm not going to.

2227
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,200
Because this is kind of huge.

2228
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:41,040
Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 going to be removed from PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

2229
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,360
Nintendo 3DS and so on in those stores.

2230
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,480
They're saying it's temporary.

2231
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,160
Apparently, there is historical archive footage that appears in the game.

2232
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,400
The licenses have expired.

2233
01:50:53,120 --> 01:51:00,000
Konami is therefore legally obligated to yank the game until they can either fix it and

2234
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,600
remove that footage, which I doubt they're going to use the resources to do, or they're

2235
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,680
going to, I guess, try to reinstate the licenses.

2236
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,760
They are saying in this press release on their official site, konami.com.

2237
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,080
We sincerely ask for your patience and understanding as we work towards making these products available

2238
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,360
for purchase once again.

2239
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,760
So they are going to try to get them back up again.

2240
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:27,600
There's a lot of this affects the GOG version of Metal Gear Solid 2.

2241
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,560
Many PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

2242
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,280
I mean, the storefronts are already kind of on their way out as it is.

2243
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:38,480
PlayStation Now, that's the when I see that, that's the big one.

2244
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,240
They have to yank it off the cloud.

2245
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,520
Something to think about with these licenses and expiring and the cloud gaming we're moving

2246
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,520
to just that's the one that catches my eye is the PlayStation Now version of the game

2247
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,720
is going to disappear.

2248
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,520
Hmm.

2249
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,960
So anyway, and that involves for PlayStation Now and PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.

2250
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,040
That's the HD collection.

2251
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:03,440
They have to throw out the whole collection for now because, of course, it includes number

2252
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,320
two and number three.

2253
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:05,840
So interesting.

2254
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,120
Garth the Wolf in chat says, Konami looking sus.

2255
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,840
Well, it is legal obligations.

2256
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,600
It's just what good news is coming out of Konami lately?

2257
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,080
I'll wait.

2258
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,080
Oh, the new BeatMania 2DX.

2259
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,200
I really want to play that.

2260
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,840
That's, I guess, there's your good news for Konami.

2261
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,280
The rest?

2262
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,640
Well, we have a story on E-Football coming up later, and I will just let that speak for

2263
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,140
itself.

2264
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,060
Anyhow.

2265
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,480
All right.

2266
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,040
Oh, yeah.

2267
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:37,600
Darticuya says, remember Dynamite Rave literally had to be rewritten about 2009 or so.

2268
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,760
Yeah, they are not good with licensing sometimes.

2269
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,260
Yes.

2270
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
How about the Silent Hill remaster?

2271
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,320
Enough said.

2272
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,800
I don't like the remake.

2273
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:48,480
Oh, yeah.

2274
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:48,720
Okay.

2275
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,520
Sacred Jade.

2276
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,240
I will.

2277
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:50,560
Okay.

2278
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,040
Yes.

2279
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:51,280
Yes.

2280
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:51,600
I will.

2281
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,360
I will golf clap that response.

2282
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,960
Castlevania collection.

2283
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,280
That is some good news that came out of Konami.

2284
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,680
I do want to point out they did contract with that other company to make the game for them.

2285
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,800
However, point taken.

2286
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,000
Point acknowledged.

2287
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,200
Golf clap earned.

2288
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:07,600
Thank you.

2289
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:08,720
All right.

2290
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:09,520
All right.

2291
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,400
Orange Rite is now putting out the TurboGrafx-16 mini.

2292
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,640
I will give you one clap because that was last year.

2293
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:14,960
All right.

2294
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,000
Enough.

2295
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,120
Moving on.

2296
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,080
You all know the point I'm trying to make.

2297
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,360
It's a hot mess over there.

2298
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,000
All right.

2299
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,800
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are

2300
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:28,720
from Konami or otherwise in the coming week.

2301
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,560
And we'll go to the US and Loki.

2302
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:31,920
Yes.

2303
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:38,720
So we have Blue Reflection, Second Light on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

2304
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:46,640
Football Manager 2022 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, iOS, and

2305
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,200
Android.

2306
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:53,280
Forza Horizon 5 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

2307
01:53:54,160 --> 01:54:01,200
We have Jurassic World Evolution 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

2308
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,320
Xbox Series.

2309
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,720
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Anniversary Edition.

2310
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,280
That's right.

2311
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,240
Todd Howard is doing it again, and he's going to make you buy Skyrim again, even though

2312
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:15,280
they already did a remastered anniversary edition before.

2313
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:23,360
That's coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

2314
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:28,080
The Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy, the definitive edition.

2315
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,680
Sure enough, it is definitive until they release another one.

2316
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:37,680
That's also coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

2317
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:38,480
Xbox Series.

2318
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,120
If they do another one, would it be redefinitive?

2319
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:45,920
It's a serious question.

2320
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,800
In the Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar Games doesn't want to make a new game.

2321
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:56,640
PUBG The New State on iOS and Android, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Nintendo

2322
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:03,040
Switch, and finally, we've got Shin Megami Tensei 5 on Nintendo Switch.

2323
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,440
That's it.

2324
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,760
All right, going to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

2325
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:12,320
You bet Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a huge release this week on the Nintendo Switch.

2326
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,560
It has a regular edition, a limited edition.

2327
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:18,720
There's even some peripherals that are coming out that are Shin Megami Tensei branded, of

2328
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,400
course, because that game is huge.

2329
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:23,040
So you can check all that out on the 11th when the game launches there.

2330
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,840
There are some other titles on the Nintendo Switch as well.

2331
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,720
What Would Dare go up against Shin Megami Tensei?

2332
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,120
How about Laid Back Camp, Have a Nice Day?

2333
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,160
That is out this week.

2334
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,840
Dragon Quest X, Heroes of the Heavenly Stars online.

2335
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,320
I'm not sure.

2336
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,520
That must be some type of re-release.

2337
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,160
I don't know if that's the first time on the Switch or what it is, but that is out

2338
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,360
as well in Japan this week.

2339
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,120
And Megaton Musashi is out this week as well in Japan.

2340
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:50,160
And Labyrinth of Galleria, Coven of Dusk is all out this week on the Nintendo Switch.

2341
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:54,080
Looking at the PlayStation 4, I imagine you have some of the similar stuff.

2342
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:58,240
Yep, we have Megaton Musashi is also out this week in the Dragon Quest game.

2343
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,880
Also on PlayStation 4.

2344
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,840
Let me check PS5 and see if any of those games made it over there this week.

2345
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:13,760
No, the next release is a Battlefield 2042, Japan's release, excuse me, on the 19th.

2346
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,680
So we're still a little ways from that.

2347
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,160
Let's go to the UK and Dark Sakura.

2348
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,320
I think you have a mute.

2349
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,480
Yes, you have a Discord mute.

2350
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:32,560
On the 9th, we have Forza Horizon 5 on Xbox.

2351
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:37,360
For Xbox and PlayStation, Jurassic World Evolution 2 on the same day.

2352
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,960
The rest of these are on the 12th.

2353
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,440
We have Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition.

2354
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,040
We have Game & Watch The Legend of Zelda.

2355
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,100
Nice.

2356
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:49,280
We have Shin Megami Tensei V5.

2357
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,520
I did the thing.

2358
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,760
I hate that I did the thing and I did the thing.

2359
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,600
Shin Megami Tensei V.

2360
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,680
And then Let's Sing 2022.

2361
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:01,520
I did the thing, Rob.

2362
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,360
How dare I do the thing?

2363
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,920
I know.

2364
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,280
I'm going to clip that.

2365
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:05,520
All right.

2366
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,240
No, just kidding.

2367
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:07,440
No, do not.

2368
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,120
All right.

2369
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,000
Let's move on and get some more headlines.

2370
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,160
And then, of course, we'll take your calls and your emails and all that good stuff and

2371
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:19,600
really make it your show a little later on with the listener roundtable.

2372
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:22,720
But for now, we have some more headlines to talk about, starting with Loki.

2373
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:36,560
Yeah, so this is a story Nintendo has promised to continually to improve the switch online

2374
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:43,120
since there's been some backlash basically saying in there and was that their investor

2375
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:48,640
meeting, I believe that the last month we released in the switch online plus expansion

2376
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:52,240
pack a new membership plan that adds content to the existing service.

2377
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:56,880
Going forward, we will continue to improve and expand on both Nintendo Switch Online

2378
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,440
and Nintendo Switch Online Plus expansion pack striving to provide services that satisfy

2379
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:01,940
customers.

2380
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,840
Yeah, I better hope you better be continually improving that service.

2381
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,840
I mean, that's the point of a service that you're charging fifty dollars for.

2382
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,160
Sony doesn't Sony or Microsoft doesn't just charge it and go, OK, we're done.

2383
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,200
We're done putting out content.

2384
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:24,080
Well, I also took it about the split that they have and now they have two levels and

2385
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,600
everybody's thinking, well, this basic level is going to be trash now because they want

2386
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,200
people to pay more for the premium level.

2387
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:32,800
So I kind of read it as Nintendo kind of recommitting to both levels.

2388
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,720
And to confirm, like I even though.

2389
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:43,120
I didn't pay for the expansion pack, meaning I did download I did pay for the DLC, though,

2390
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:46,960
for Animal Crossing, but I'm not I'm not paying for the expansion back.

2391
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,840
So they miss out on the five dollars there, but it's still it's stupid, like it's just

2392
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,040
a principal thing for me, like I don't know.

2393
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:57,600
Thank you.

2394
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:01,760
Like, I'm not giving you more money, especially when you haven't proved with the current

2395
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:06,800
expansion pass stuff that you're willing to continually update it.

2396
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,680
I mean, it's just minimal effort being put in by them.

2397
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:10,080
Yeah.

2398
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,640
So sorry, I'm not going to you can promise all you want, but you haven't shown that you're

2399
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,360
going to do it.

2400
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:15,760
Yep.

2401
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,400
Actions.

2402
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:22,720
I mean, I understand they have to playing Yakuza games has taught me that the board

2403
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:26,240
meetings are very important and you have to please the board of directors.

2404
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,440
But I get it.

2405
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,240
With the shareholder meetings, you have to talk a lot of talk.

2406
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:34,720
But for us, the gamers, we got to see the action and we got to see the you know, the

2407
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,080
stuff that really makes it worth it.

2408
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,280
So we'll see.

2409
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:42,320
I'm curious what big free thing Nintendo is going to try to throw at the game and Game

2410
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,440
Boy Advance games.

2411
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,320
That's what they're going to do.

2412
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,600
That's the easiest.

2413
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,040
Like, come on.

2414
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,760
I think there needs to be something more like, yes, sure.

2415
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,920
I like Game Boy, Game Boy Advance games, but I think there needs to be.

2416
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,560
Here's the problem.

2417
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,120
Here's the problem.

2418
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:58,560
If Game Boy and Game Boy Advance does not include Pokemon, forget it.

2419
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,440
And that's the thing.

2420
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,040
Everybody hears Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.

2421
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,800
They think, oh, well, I want to play the Pokemon games.

2422
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,320
You better get you better level set those expectations.

2423
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:12,480
Because technically those games are from the Pokemon company, which is like second party.

2424
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:17,840
So I don't, you know, and also Nintendo can, you know, as they're doing with the fourth

2425
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:21,760
gen, just remake those games and charge a whole separate premium for them and people

2426
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,400
will pay it.

2427
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:27,040
So don't assume Pokemon games are going to be a part of that.

2428
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,160
So what's left?

2429
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:31,840
There's Metro, the original Metroid 2, you know, there's some other, you know, not to

2430
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,440
say obviously there are some good, but I just think the highlights are not going to be what

2431
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,640
you all want them to be.

2432
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,280
That's my thought.

2433
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,760
So, all right.

2434
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:48,240
Moving on and on a similar note with Nintendo, and I think we kind of addressed this on a

2435
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:50,400
previous show, but it's kind of continue.

2436
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,800
I want to say this got brought up again this week because of that same shareholder meeting.

2437
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:01,040
Nikkei Asia is talking about that Nintendo is going to make 20% fewer Switch consoles

2438
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:02,400
through the end of the fiscal year.

2439
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:05,040
And this all ties into the chip shortage that's going on.

2440
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:08,880
That means 24 million fewer units than what was planned.

2441
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:13,520
And yeah, that's basically the headline.

2442
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,960
I mean, yes, there's still a lot of games when you consider Metroid Dread, the new old

2443
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,960
Mario Party that came out and, you know, the other things that are on the horizon for next

2444
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,720
year or Animal Crossing 2.0, if you will.

2445
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:32,640
Next year, Splatoon 3, Bayonetta 3, but the reality is the chip shortage is just playing

2446
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,880
into how many Switches they can make.

2447
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:39,840
And if that doesn't scream the answer to what happened to the 4K Switch.

2448
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:47,040
Ah, that's I mean, and we said that then it's probably because of the chip shortage.

2449
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:50,320
And Nintendo hardware is already hard enough to come by.

2450
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,600
Now put this on top of it.

2451
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:52,800
It's going to be a nightmare.

2452
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:58,400
So on when you consider all that, I am glad Nintendo put off the 4K Switch to be quite

2453
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:04,800
honest, like because I do not want to have to I do not want to have to Squid Game to

2454
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,840
win a 4K Switch.

2455
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,720
So do that when the chip shortage is looking a little better.

2456
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:20,320
Speaking of whatever's in the future for Nintendo in that interesting meeting, they did

2457
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:25,920
confirm there's another Nintendo console in the works for release 20XX.

2458
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,480
Great.

2459
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,600
So we get a new Nintendo console coming out before 2099.

2460
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:38,320
It's interesting that a lot of websites are running that as a headline because no fucking

2461
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:38,720
shit.

2462
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,960
Nintendo is working on a new console.

2463
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,520
Guess what?

2464
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,680
I feel like I've said this before.

2465
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,400
I'm going to say it again.

2466
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,480
PlayStation is working on PlayStation 6.

2467
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:47,600
What?

2468
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,600
But it's so early.

2469
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:56,320
These things take years to come up with years of development, trial and error, cost analysis,

2470
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,440
parts.

2471
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:01,120
Now that we're seeing launch games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2472
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:04,560
So yes, of course, they're working on a successor to the Switch.

2473
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:12,080
I think the real question is, has the 4K Switch been scrapped altogether for a future like

2474
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:16,000
is the future Nintendo console now a 4K Switch?

2475
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,400
Because that's I think that's where it ends up.

2476
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,800
But we'll see.

2477
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:25,520
Anyhow, on a completely different note, Dark Sakura.

2478
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:27,780
Well.

2479
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:33,120
We often call politics a game, right?

2480
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:39,040
Some of us do, because it really can just go back and forth and one tries to win versus

2481
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:39,540
the other.

2482
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:47,680
There's actually a Kickstarter now to make a game and to teach about politics and the

2483
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:49,600
nature of how it works.

2484
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:55,840
It's called Political Arena, created by Elliot Nelson, who is a journalist who wrote for

2485
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,600
Huffington Post until 2018.

2486
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,520
So you legislate.

2487
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,480
And this is actually the quote.

2488
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:05,520
You can legislate, you can campaign, you can navigate the media, you can weather scandals,

2489
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:11,840
you can try and pick apart the myriad interests on K Street and other special interests.

2490
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:15,920
So you customize your politician and then decide how to invest their time.

2491
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,640
And then you can see how weak or strong they are in certain skills.

2492
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:22,320
And then the game plays out from there.

2493
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:30,320
So if you are a fan of, you know, following politicians or kind of want to see a little

2494
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:36,720
bit about, you know, what all you'd have to juggle for it, you could sign up for the Kickstarter.

2495
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,720
It looks kind of interesting.

2496
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:49,280
Like one of the screenshots on here is like Senator Olin misspells butter, which how many

2497
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,480
times have we seen?

2498
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,320
People drug for their grammar.

2499
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:54,800
Oh, sure.

2500
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,840
What by me?

2501
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:01,280
How how many of us are old enough to remember the whole potato shenanigans with Vice President

2502
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,160
Quayle at the time?

2503
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:05,280
That was it's very much a reference to that.

2504
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:08,480
Yeah, we had way too many of them with the dumpster that we just got used to it.

2505
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:09,940
Yeah.

2506
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:15,840
What's interesting about this to me, you know, political games are nothing new.

2507
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,920
I mean, hello, we had that guy who made cat president like the actual.

2508
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,040
Yeah, that's a political game of sorts, a little tongue in cheek.

2509
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,240
But I remember playing a game on like the Commodore 64 in the 80s.

2510
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,760
It was like a campaign manager game.

2511
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:32,080
But it's not that the political game element is new, but it's interesting that the talent

2512
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:37,040
behind this and that there is, you know, people that might bring some sort of, you know, I

2513
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:42,000
don't know if you want to call it insider, but sort of like just more like weathered,

2514
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,560
I guess, experiences into a game.

2515
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,440
I think that's interesting.

2516
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:54,720
Well, the producer, Diana Williams, she's former exec at Lucasfilm, said that she wants

2517
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:58,160
it to be fun to play, but also to be educational.

2518
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:05,920
And she one of her quotes is, and if you and if through while having fun, they're able

2519
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,200
to say, hey, I didn't know this about X, Y, Z, then we have also done our job.

2520
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:17,200
Um, she's kind of, you know, wanting this to show a lot more of an honest view of how

2521
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:18,400
politics work.

2522
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:26,080
I mean, it's very much just like old courtly drama, you know, where this person moves against

2523
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:29,840
this person and this person with power moves this way and you make these alliances and

2524
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,160
you do this thing, except, of course, very modern.

2525
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:36,800
You know, she said she wants it to give more information than Schoolhouse Rock.

2526
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,960
It's chess on a different board.

2527
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:43,040
It is, yeah, it's it's really.

2528
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:50,400
The only thing that I can really liken the world of politics to, excuse me, my nose is

2529
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:54,000
itching as a dumpster on fire in the ocean.

2530
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,440
No, it's like when you watch, um,

2531
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:07,200
I was trying to think, kind of like watching Game of Thrones, I think, when you're watching

2532
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:12,240
how the families sort of move against each other and interact and how you sway opinion

2533
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:13,840
to get alliances with one or the other.

2534
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:18,480
I mean, in this case, if you're trying to sway someone's opinion, you go to a charity

2535
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:23,280
dinner, you donate to so-and-so's cause, even if you don't believe in it, you want so-and-so

2536
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:27,040
to be on your side because you want them to think that you think the same way they do.

2537
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:31,680
Um, it goes also into the less savory side of politics.

2538
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:41,440
Um, by like, you can do attack ads, you can do, uh, uh, you know, social media manipulation.

2539
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:50,240
Um, you can, I mean, they've even got people, uh, who worked, uh, in campaigns working on

2540
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:50,800
this game.

2541
02:07:51,440 --> 02:08:01,120
Um, it's, it's absolutely, you know, going to be completely, I think, a candid and honest

2542
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:04,080
look at it, but still supposed to be something that you're, you're supposed to have fun with.

2543
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:11,600
All I have to say about the wide world of politics is remember my ex, the politician?

2544
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:16,560
That is all I'm going to say about that.

2545
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,640
That was a very eye-opening experience.

2546
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:22,960
Thankfully, he, even though apparently he got a lot of votes, uh, he did not end up

2547
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,400
holding public office.

2548
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:28,960
And, uh, last I heard still hasn't, although honestly, I haven't heard a lot in a long

2549
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,160
time, but, uh, the world's a better place for it.

2550
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:33,840
Sorry to be shady, but also not sorry.

2551
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:35,760
I'm not sorry.

2552
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:37,520
I'm not either.

2553
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:40,400
I'm just supposed to be nice on, on the show.

2554
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,720
And I say this as a weird person.

2555
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:46,960
He's such a weird guy.

2556
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,140
Yeah.

2557
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:54,880
Well, that's, you know, I embrace my weird and he was completely strange to me.

2558
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,160
That's what happens when you, uh, you know what, I'm not going to get into it.

2559
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:58,880
I'm not going to get into it.

2560
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,760
I'm not going to get into it.

2561
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:01,840
I'm a better, I am a better person.

2562
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,280
All right, let's move on.

2563
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:08,560
Speaking of Loki, why don't you be a better person with this next story?

2564
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:18,320
Uh, I don't know if I could be the better person, but so Konami has decided to delay

2565
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:27,440
E-Football 2022 version one to next year, probably because there's a lot of updates

2566
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,240
and fixes they're going to have to do to even get to version one.

2567
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:32,640
And so that's just an inevitability of them.

2568
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,880
But yes, they have pushed it back to spring of 2022.

2569
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:40,000
I just say, don't even bother at this point.

2570
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:46,480
It's just, it's trash, but yeah, they're, they're pushing it back.

2571
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,200
Even though they already like, wasn't, they released it and stuff.

2572
02:09:49,200 --> 02:10:01,520
So yeah, and I go along with that, um, they are, you may remember because, um, we had

2573
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:08,480
brought it up in the story, they were so bold to pre-order the premium player pack, which

2574
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:11,920
was paid DLC for that premium game.

2575
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:18,160
And yeah, they're refunding that for folks because, um, you know, their game is jank

2576
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:18,720
and broken.

2577
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:27,280
So I apologize for the awkward silence, but I literally have nothing.

2578
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:28,800
Congratulations, Konami.

2579
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:32,080
You've managed to successfully pee and poo the bed.

2580
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:35,360
Like, I don't, I don't know what to say.

2581
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:39,840
What do you say to some company that is such a colossal fucking mess?

2582
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,200
Like, what do you say?

2583
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:46,080
What do you say when you walk in the room and just, it's just, it's not even a room.

2584
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,200
You've literally done that silent hill thing where you go through the hole and like, it

2585
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:56,480
was, it used to be a room, but now it's murder.

2586
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,840
Like, I don't, what, what do you say?

2587
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:03,760
There's nothing.

2588
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,560
And they have like the last thing that they had that was good was like pro Evo soccer.

2589
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,280
And then they're like, Hey, wait, hold on, hold on.

2590
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,600
There's still an opportunity for us to screw this up.

2591
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:17,600
And you know what?

2592
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:25,360
They had, they took, it took some gusto, but they managed to pull that mess up in 2021.

2593
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:26,000
They did it.

2594
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,560
So congrats, Konami.

2595
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:33,120
Uh, dark Tetsuya chat says it's that meme from community.

2596
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:35,280
He walks in with a pizza and everything's on fire.

2597
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:36,560
At least that guy had pizza.

2598
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:39,360
That's a fair point.

2599
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,720
Is, is, is there a playable game here?

2600
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:43,760
Nope.

2601
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,200
At least that guy had pizza.

2602
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:49,440
Uh, as Joe and her mat says, just play that Bob Saget clip from dumb and dumber.

2603
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:50,480
There's shit everywhere.

2604
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:55,520
How about the Bob Saget directed movie dirty work, starring the late Norm McDonald rest

2605
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:01,360
in peace where the CA everybody, you have to know the scene where the guys look, there's

2606
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,280
a dead hooker in that trunk over there.

2607
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,320
Oh, Oh my gosh.

2608
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,600
Another dead hooker.

2609
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:10,320
Like it's, it's like really a tasteless scene and everything, but it's really funny.

2610
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:16,480
Uh, if you have a dirty mind and it's that, that, that is a little more appropriate to

2611
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,800
what Konami is going through right now.

2612
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:21,520
Like, I just, I, I don't know what to say.

2613
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:27,840
Um, Mike Defton chat says PT was foreshadowing of Konami state.

2614
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,840
Now I know why Konami shut it down.

2615
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,720
Now Bobby Black Wolf points out their gambling side isn't a mess.

2616
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,600
It makes money.

2617
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:34,720
Well, you know, what's interesting.

2618
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:40,480
And maybe this goes back to the old division of, um, Konami, the arcade publisher and case

2619
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:40,720
set.

2620
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:44,880
What used to be that Konami, you know, computer entertainment, I guess technically still is

2621
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,320
except they closed all the U S offices.

2622
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,920
I don't even know how to sort that mess anymore.

2623
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:55,040
My point is arcade hardware, gambling machines, things like that.

2624
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:55,600
Pachinko.

2625
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,280
Those are all fine.

2626
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:59,920
It's the software division.

2627
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:01,040
That's a fucking nightmare.

2628
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,760
Now, yes, uh, y'all brought up the Castlevania thing, but again, I said that really, that

2629
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,200
kind of wasn't Konami.

2630
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,600
That kind of wasn't, it actually wasn't Konami.

2631
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,880
It was their, it was their games.

2632
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:14,240
It was their, it was their old shit, but somebody did it for them.

2633
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:19,280
And honestly, after hearing about this football game, I think we should all be thankful someone

2634
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:24,400
else did it for them because believe me, Konami would have found a way to pee and poo that

2635
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:28,240
Castlevania collection if they'd done it themselves.

2636
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:35,440
Uh, Tigerclaw in chat says, I still can't get over the fact two of the channels here

2637
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:38,320
are named after the company that used to make arcade games.

2638
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:43,440
Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, I think talking about, they were talking about something else, uh, with

2639
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:44,640
Valley Sports and all that stuff.

2640
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:51,040
Um, I, it is funny that the name of our show comes from a Konami namesake, but it is, it

2641
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:54,160
is quite literally the Konami of a different era, literally.

2642
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:57,840
And we'll always keep DDR near and dear in our hearts.

2643
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:00,080
And like I said, honestly, arcade division's fine.

2644
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:01,360
Like new DDR mixes.

2645
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:02,080
Cool.

2646
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,360
Uh, new 2DXs.

2647
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:03,680
Yeah.

2648
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,400
You know, all that stuff.

2649
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:04,800
That's fine.

2650
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,240
I don't got, I don't got no complaints about that, except I just got old.

2651
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:13,360
I'm a Bamani boomer now as we talked about on a previous episode of OLR, but, um, that's

2652
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:14,000
all cool.

2653
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,040
I don't got a problem with that.

2654
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:22,480
Anyway, one more story for you guys and Loki kind of referenced this already.

2655
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:23,040
Thanks, Loki.

2656
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:27,760
You know, but I understand it's in the release dates, but, um, Hey, look, Skyrim.

2657
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:35,120
Is coming out once again, it is the anniversary edition and it's kind of all over the place.

2658
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:35,620
Okay.

2659
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,960
So here's the deal.

2660
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,720
God damn it.

2661
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:42,080
The story won't open because it thinks I'm using an ad blocker on this site.

2662
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:47,600
Um, there are different price levels for this, uh, uh, game that's coming out.

2663
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:49,760
There's going to be $49.99 edition.

2664
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,600
And I think that's the new one, or it's going to be $19.99.

2665
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:57,200
If you want to just upgrade, I guess your existing edition.

2666
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:01,680
But then I also heard one of them is coming out on game pass somehow.

2667
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,040
Because Skyrim is there, but it's like not the newest one, even though Microsoft owns

2668
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:11,120
Bethesda now, like this newest one is not coming out right away or something.

2669
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:11,600
I don't know.

2670
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,880
It seems like a disaster, uh, of different pricing.

2671
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:15,360
It's confused.

2672
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:18,800
I shouldn't say disaster because, you know, Skyrim is a good game, but it's confusing

2673
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,680
all these different tiers.

2674
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:26,080
And it's confusing why Skyrim is getting released again, but it's, you know, the 10 year collection

2675
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:32,080
and I get it from the perspective of, okay, they have to make it even better for the Xbox

2676
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:37,520
series and for PlayStation five, but it's like, okay, they already kind of redid it

2677
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,680
for Xbox one X and you can play that version on game and it looks fine.

2678
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:42,320
It looks great.

2679
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,760
It looks better than fine.

2680
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:49,120
Um, so I guess what now you get ray tracing and extra sparkles and things like that.

2681
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:49,840
Cool.

2682
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:55,600
Um, but I don't, I don't know if it's really necessary to drop money to get this game all

2683
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:56,320
over again.

2684
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:00,160
Um, but I guess Bethesda is hoping many of you will think differently.

2685
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:02,880
Anything you want to add to that Loki?

2686
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:04,320
Cause I know you're a Skyrim fan.

2687
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:11,520
Um, it's, it's a lot of it is just these, they keep trying to push that, uh, the creator

2688
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,720
club stuff really.

2689
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:16,000
And so there's like a lot of pieces from that, but it's, it's all mods.

2690
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:17,680
Some of it's kind of cool.

2691
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:22,800
I mean, they've got like fishing and stuff in there now and, um, different armor sets.

2692
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,320
Like if you're a fan of the other elder scrolls games, there's armor sets from those.

2693
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,960
Um, is it 1999?

2694
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:29,200
Cool.

2695
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,480
Because that's the cost to upgrade.

2696
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:32,960
Probably.

2697
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,640
I mean, there's a lot of content in there.

2698
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:35,280
I just don't know.

2699
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,680
I'll just wait for the go on sale there.

2700
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:40,400
At the very least, they're giving you some stuff for free though.

2701
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:43,760
So even if you don't upgrade and you already have a special edition, which probably most

2702
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,320
of you did, cause they also updated that for free.

2703
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:54,000
Um, then you get like, there's three big pieces of DLC kind of there being thrown in there.

2704
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,440
So I'll wait, it'll hit game pass eventually.

2705
02:16:57,440 --> 02:16:58,800
It will hit game as eventually.

2706
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,400
It has to, I'll wait for that.

2707
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:01,280
I mean, yeah.

2708
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,960
I mean, it's definitely gonna hit game pass eventually and, and see sales.

2709
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,680
I mean, that's just always they're cheap, so just wait.

2710
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,120
All right.

2711
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,200
But don't wait for this segment.

2712
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,400
It's the listener round table where we're going to take your calls.

2713
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:19,600
If you'd like to call us over at vognetwork.com slash discord, just hop into the green room

2714
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:24,960
and we might take a call or two, but we also want to take a look inside our mailbag, which

2715
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,440
is at participate at orangelandtrader.com.

2716
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:31,920
Something that was brought to my attention though, um, by a listener in our discord today

2717
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,800
over at vognetwork.com slash discord, because, you know, we chat with you all throughout

2718
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:39,360
the week, um, is that somebody tried to send an email through the website and it didn't

2719
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:40,080
work.

2720
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:44,080
Um, I have to confess the website is old and it's broken.

2721
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:49,360
And the only reason it exists right now is because it powers this show, uh, and the feed,

2722
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:51,520
uh, that is still on iTunes.

2723
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:57,760
And I am scared as hell to change some of that because, um, obviously I don't want,

2724
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:02,240
I don't want to lose the podcast feed that we have and you, cause we have like, we're

2725
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:06,560
probably the, I don't, is there an older show on iTunes?

2726
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:10,240
I don't, we've been, we've been on iTunes since day one.

2727
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:14,160
I don't know if there's any other current running show that was there on day one.

2728
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:17,840
Like, I'm not trying to toot our horn too much toot toot, but like there's certain,

2729
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:23,360
yeah, Guinness, there's certain types of prestige you don't want to lose.

2730
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,160
And that's one of them.

2731
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:31,680
So, um, my point is the website has been updated in like 15 years and Hey, update the website,

2732
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:33,120
just don't touch the feed links.

2733
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,040
And that, that might be the ultimate solution.

2734
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,120
And you know, Jason and I talked about it a long time ago.

2735
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,320
We just never got around to it.

2736
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:39,840
And I do want to be clear.

2737
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:44,080
Somebody was very kind, a listener named Deke Mann and I'm sure if he still listens to the

2738
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:48,240
show, somebody was very kind in doing that website for us 15 years ago and did it out

2739
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:49,280
of the goodness of his heart.

2740
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,480
And I just want to say thank you.

2741
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:51,840
I can never thank you enough for that.

2742
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:56,400
I can't thank Jason enough for the multiple favors around on Facebook.

2743
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,520
I see him on Facebook.

2744
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:57,680
Yeah.

2745
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,880
The social media and all that stuff.

2746
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,760
I still see deep, but I don't, you know, people come and come and go from the show.

2747
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,480
I, and I appreciate both those guys immensely.

2748
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:08,960
But the reality is he did it 15 years ago, but a lot's changed.

2749
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:12,400
So yes, a new website is something that we really should work on.

2750
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:18,000
So anyway, my point is if you try to send an email through the website, don't, uh, just

2751
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,360
use your email client, participate at orange lounge, rated.com.

2752
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:25,200
However, I can see why people would think that.

2753
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:26,720
Why not just go to a website, clicking it.

2754
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:30,400
So I have to figure out how to update that to give a, uh, heads up or something like

2755
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:30,720
that.

2756
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:33,600
It should just be a mail to link.

2757
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,400
Um, Bobby black, Bobby black Wolf says, uh, gamertag radio was there day one respectfully.

2758
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:44,320
And of course I, I re I realized they also have been running a very long time.

2759
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:45,440
They've done more episodes.

2760
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:48,160
I have nothing but respect for Danny and the work that he does.

2761
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:54,320
I thought he came out after iTunes launched because that was what inspired him to go the

2762
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:55,360
direction from what he was.

2763
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:58,000
He was doing like a fantasy star thing before I could be wrong.

2764
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:04,400
And if I am, I am sorry, but, um, and I'm sure, I'm sure there are also non video game

2765
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,320
podcasts that have been there since day one.

2766
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:12,320
Um, but, um, not many that's for sure.

2767
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,640
So, all right.

2768
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:21,120
Anyway, I, but I don't, I don't think it was very long after, um, some of the day one podcasts.

2769
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:26,960
There was the one with the dudes in Cleveland, but they kind of faded, although they like

2770
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:28,640
we'll do one show a year or something like that.

2771
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:34,320
And again, please do not hear any of this as disrespect because it takes a lot of work

2772
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,000
to do a show for one year.

2773
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,840
And I have nothing but respect for the folks that do that.

2774
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:44,560
But at the same time, we're, yes, we've been doing this for 19 years and we're going to

2775
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:45,760
kind of toot that a little bit.

2776
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:46,960
We're very proud of it.

2777
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,000
You know, it takes it.

2778
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,240
Yes.

2779
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,080
It's taken a lot of dedication to go that long.

2780
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,800
So to do Bobby says I showed up a month after iTunes.

2781
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,560
I was month one, but not day one.

2782
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:00,640
That still puts you in the old folks home, Bobby, as far as I'm concerned.

2783
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:03,920
So it will be interesting to see what happens.

2784
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,160
Should we ever decide to call it quits?

2785
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:08,320
Who's still going at that time?

2786
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:12,080
And, um, I, cause I don't know.

2787
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:18,480
I, I'm, I'm very confident we are the longest running podcast about video games or internet

2788
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:21,040
show, especially, especially when you combine all that together.

2789
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,640
I don't know who's second place.

2790
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:24,720
Y'all can fight about that.

2791
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:26,080
I don't know.

2792
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:27,440
All right.

2793
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:29,120
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

2794
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:33,360
Uh, I was going to get to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com.

2795
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:36,160
Yes, there is one.

2796
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:36,660
Yay.

2797
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:44,160
Um, I don't have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say Ronnie with Microsoft announcing

2798
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:46,640
their avatars and virtual universe for teams.

2799
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,520
Do you think PlayStation home was ahead of its time?

2800
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:54,640
If Sony had stuck it out to this point, do you think there would have been opportunities

2801
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:58,240
for them to utilize the service professionally during COVID?

2802
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:03,040
Also, do you think AR tech missed a huge opportunity to advance during COVID?

2803
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,320
I've been, uh, thanks.

2804
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,960
I've been listening since life 365 days.

2805
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:07,680
Wow.

2806
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:09,680
This is my first time in mailbag.

2807
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:11,200
Wow.

2808
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,200
Well, hi Ronnie.

2809
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:13,680
Well, hi.

2810
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,760
We love a long time listener.

2811
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,880
First time caller.

2812
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,200
Wow.

2813
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:18,160
That is a long time.

2814
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:21,360
The live is five days that predates iTunes.

2815
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:21,840
I think.

2816
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,160
Yeah, no, it absolutely does.

2817
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,400
Cause that's where we started there.

2818
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:30,720
No, I know, but I'm trying to think where, remember there was about a year that we were

2819
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:33,440
doing a podcast and a live show and then we combined.

2820
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:33,940
Right.

2821
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:36,800
I, we have the to go edition.

2822
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,600
I think we were still on life 365 at that time.

2823
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:44,080
But is this then when we were doing to go or was it when we were just doing orange

2824
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:46,240
lounge radio and it's earlier iteration?

2825
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:47,200
Probably both.

2826
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,440
But anyway, I, I, cause, uh, all games didn't happen.

2827
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:57,520
There was only one show when all games happen.

2828
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,800
There was no more to go edition.

2829
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:00,160
So it had to be, it had to be.

2830
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,660
Yeah.

2831
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:02,400
Yeah.

2832
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,720
Yeah.

2833
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:04,240
So the questions anyway.

2834
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:04,740
Yes.

2835
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:06,640
Um, so yes.

2836
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,800
Going back to the question about, oh yes.

2837
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,480
Was a PlayStation home ahead of its time?

2838
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,720
Yes and no.

2839
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:18,640
Um, I think there were features of home that were underutilized and undersold.

2840
02:23:18,640 --> 02:23:22,480
And then, and instead we got promises that never came to real fruition.

2841
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:28,400
Um, such as like that virtual display case of the various achievements that you got.

2842
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:33,040
You could get a shirt here and there in PlayStation home, but they never really

2843
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:38,000
pushed that forward in the way that I think people really wanted to see.

2844
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,360
But I think PlayStation, I think a lot of people would be into PlayStation home,

2845
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:43,440
that type of thing, if it existed now.

2846
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:47,520
And, um, I, I, you know, there's always been those rumors about, you know, oh, they're

2847
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,600
going to do, uh, PlayStation is going to do their knockoff of VR chat and it's going to

2848
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,920
be PlayStation home and PlayStation VR.

2849
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,520
Um, I think that's nice.

2850
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:58,640
I, I don't know if that would actually happen or not.

2851
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:02,240
Um, my other big bitch about PlayStation home was that they should have let us have

2852
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:05,680
more control over the clubhouses, but I think they were really paranoid about

2853
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:09,040
copyright theft and things like that, but we could have done so much more with that

2854
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:09,920
oil, our clubhouse.

2855
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,920
So we've been giving a little more freedom.

2856
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:15,120
Um, but there were, there were elements of it that were ahead of its time.

2857
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:15,440
Yes.

2858
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:19,520
And I think it would be a very interesting player if it was still around today.

2859
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:20,240
Absolutely.

2860
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:26,800
So thank you, Bobby, with the timeline, you came to all games in early 2006.

2861
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:29,520
iTunes was June of 2005.

2862
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:34,080
There was like a year period in there where everything happened very fast.

2863
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,520
And there was a lot that happened really fast.

2864
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:39,760
There was the launch of to go.

2865
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:44,000
There was the launch of iTunes, which then shot up our listenership like crazy.

2866
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:48,880
As far as podcasting goes, there was then live 365 up to all the rates.

2867
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,400
So then we moved to all games.

2868
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:52,800
But before that was the syndication on all games.

2869
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:56,480
There was like a three or four month period where like they were playing our

2870
02:24:56,480 --> 02:24:59,440
show, but it was just a rerun, uh, kind of like DDR free grade.

2871
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,160
It was doing back then.

2872
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:04,720
There's just, there was a lot that happened in like a year, 18 month period

2873
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:07,600
very quickly, um, that this all kind of falls into.

2874
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:10,080
Anyway, thanks for the walk down memory lane.

2875
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:11,120
And thank you for the email.

2876
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,360
Um, Quest Buster says the Japanese PlayStation Home was really nice versus

2877
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,240
the one in the States.

2878
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,480
They gave away so much free stuff.

2879
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,040
Yeah, I think.

2880
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:22,080
I think you get out what you put into it.

2881
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,800
And I think if Sony had put a little more into PlayStation Home, they would

2882
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:29,280
have really seen the rewards they that year that they did the virtual E3 in

2883
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:34,320
PlayStation Home was actually kind of interesting, uh, and kind of neat.

2884
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:38,160
And it's a real, but I bet very few people actually experienced that because

2885
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:41,440
there was just a lot of like, LOL PlayStation Home.

2886
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:43,680
Remember we used to have that listener.

2887
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,800
Definitely a former listener.

2888
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,240
I think unfortunately he rage quit.

2889
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,840
We said something he didn't agree with or something.

2890
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:49,440
And, um, it happens.

2891
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:53,360
Uh, he was like super into PlayStation Home and would call into the show and

2892
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:56,000
talk about like all these things that PlayStation Home was doing.

2893
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,680
And we, he were the guy and went to his PlayStation Home clubhouse and we were

2894
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:04,000
actually kind of like, wow, you really can do a lot of cool shit in this game.

2895
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,240
Like he had a really cool little thing laid out and everything.

2896
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:09,280
And yeah, there was a lot you could do a PlayStation Home that just, I don't

2897
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:15,440
think really broke through into the masses, like how to really explain that,

2898
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:17,920
you know, and I think that's a big part of it as well.

2899
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:21,680
Um, it's interesting though, if I remember the email, right.

2900
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:26,720
Kind of brought up Microsoft teams and maybe Microsoft entering this space.

2901
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:33,120
Um, I mean, it would be interesting, but it, since they're bringing it up in

2902
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:36,640
teams, I think a lot of that has to do with the pandemic.

2903
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:41,200
And maybe when we talk about PlayStation Home, we talk about what could that have

2904
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:44,240
looked like if that was around when the pandemic started, that could have been

2905
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,160
a very interesting sort of thing.

2906
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:50,000
Um, but I feel like Microsoft's responses is nothing to do with gaming in which

2907
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,840
you see in teams, but more a response to the pandemic and the reality of the

2908
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:58,640
hybrid office model, if not completely work from home model that many people

2909
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:00,320
are going to in the future.

2910
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:04,800
Um, there's just, it's, it's instead of you work in the office or you work

2911
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:08,080
at home, there's going to be a lot of people in a middle category very soon,

2912
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:08,960
a hybrid model.

2913
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:13,680
Um, and I think this like Microsoft teams, uh, changes there may is, is in

2914
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,680
response to that, what it can do for gaming.

2915
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:16,960
I don't know.

2916
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:22,960
Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says, uh, Microsoft is already doing it.

2917
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:24,480
It's called alt space VR.

2918
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:29,440
It's I, I forgot about that Zen monkey until you mentioned it.

2919
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:31,600
So Microsoft isn't really pushing it.

2920
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,520
And so it's really about, you know, if Microsoft wants something like that

2921
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:39,120
to be for gaming, they're going to really have to put that oomph behind it

2922
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,720
that makes gamers want to check it out.

2923
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:44,960
Unfortunately, a lot of experimental Microsoft products that really should

2924
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:47,360
have stuck around also go away.

2925
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:49,360
Uh, so this isn't something unique to Sony.

2926
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,320
So let's have, let's have our weekly complaint.

2927
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,640
Where's one versus 100.

2928
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,520
That was awesome.

2929
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,760
Where's Microsoft game room.

2930
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:01,680
As far as selling me an emulator goes, that was probably one of the best they

2931
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,760
ever did was Microsoft game room.

2932
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:08,320
Like, so Microsoft isn't unique to walking away from these things that

2933
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,320
should have been better fully realized.

2934
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:13,920
But alas, that is the game industry we live in sometimes.

2935
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:16,400
And the last, that was the only email we got, but thank you.

2936
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:17,120
Longtime listener.

2937
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:20,720
First time caller Ronnie for the email participate at orange launch,

2938
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:21,280
rated.com.

2939
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:26,560
If you want to send us an email for a future week, uh, and not the website.

2940
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:29,120
I don't see anybody in the green room.

2941
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,400
I'll give it to just another moment.

2942
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:35,360
If you have any questions for us, uh, you can shout them out in our, um, uh,

2943
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:37,920
Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

2944
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,640
In the meantime, I want to check in with Loki and see if there's

2945
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:41,680
any last minute stories.

2946
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:47,280
Uh, the only thing I had is that apparently, uh, it looks like fail

2947
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:53,440
overflow, the famous, um, cracking and hacking group has shown that they

2948
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:56,240
can decrypt the PlayStation five firmware files.

2949
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,160
Oh, interesting.

2950
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:01,280
So what does that ultimately mean?

2951
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:03,920
Does that mean they're going to try to do a home brew injection on

2952
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:04,640
PlayStation five?

2953
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,480
Or is that like, that's not emulation.

2954
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:09,520
That's like home brew trying to run that stuff on PS five, right?

2955
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:09,680
Yeah.

2956
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:15,600
And they also, there's another, um, another screenshot from a PlayStation

2957
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:20,640
actually showing debug settings enabled on the PlayStation five as well.

2958
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:23,760
So, all right, we'll wait and see what happens.

2959
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:26,960
All right.

2960
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:29,360
Well, I still do not see anyone in the green room, so I don't think we're

2961
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:31,760
getting any calls tonight and that is okay.

2962
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:34,160
Uh, and then I don't really see any direct questions.

2963
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:37,120
So, um, yeah, I think we, I think we kind of burned through all the news.

2964
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:38,400
We had some good stuff.

2965
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:41,600
Uh, Oh, Garth the Wolf in chat brings up the Endwalker delay, which I guess

2966
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:44,800
I didn't really exist during the address during the show.

2967
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:47,600
I thought I would get to it during my game week, but Garth the Wolf says

2968
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:50,320
Endwalker delay is a relief because now I will actually have time to

2969
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:52,720
complete my first relic weapon in Bozja.

2970
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,840
I don't even know if I'll get around to that, but I will get all my jobs to

2971
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,160
80.

2972
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,880
I might hit 80 tonight on my last job after the show.

2973
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:02,080
We'll see how, how long I have, uh, and if I have help.

2974
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:06,400
Um, but, um, yeah, they delayed Endwalker by two weeks.

2975
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:09,520
It was supposed to come out in early access, I think November 23rd.

2976
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:11,680
And now it's pushed back to December 3rd.

2977
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:14,640
And, uh, there was a big live letter that they did on Friday.

2978
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:17,440
And, um, you know, they were talking about this and a lot of the other

2979
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:18,480
changes of the game.

2980
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:23,440
And, uh, Yoshi P, the producer director of Final Fantasy 14 looked so upset.

2981
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:25,120
He looked like he was going to cry.

2982
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:28,880
I wanted to hug him because it's not a big deal.

2983
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,080
It's two weeks, whatever.

2984
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:34,640
Do you, do you really, you guys have to remember Yoshi P is not only working

2985
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:39,840
on Final Fantasy 14, the greatest turnaround in video game history.

2986
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:41,440
I would put it above Diablo 3.

2987
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:42,400
I really would.

2988
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:45,600
Final Fantasy 14 is the greatest turnaround in gaming history.

2989
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:48,160
Yoshi P is to credit for that.

2990
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:51,680
And it's hardworking team, but there is a leader of that team and it's Yoshi P.

2991
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:57,440
In addition to Final Fantasy 14, he is also working on Final Fantasy 16.

2992
02:30:58,480 --> 02:31:00,160
That man is fucking busy.

2993
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:07,920
And to see him literally pour his heart out for all of us because QA issues and wanting

2994
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:12,560
to make sure the game isn't fucked when it releases caused a two week delay.

2995
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,160
Like I just, I wanted to hug him.

2996
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:18,000
I felt so bad, but you know, and most people were understanding.

2997
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:23,520
Probably 90%, you know, even higher were understanding, but of course there's going

2998
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,960
to be those people that are like, I took the day off work and I'm very upset because I

2999
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:28,320
can't get my PTO rearranged.

3000
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:31,200
You guys are very upset to do this at the last minute is so rude.

3001
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:38,080
Hey, hey, put your clown dress on tonight because you're the one that took time off

3002
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:38,800
for an MMO.

3003
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:43,200
And MMO launches are almost always bort.

3004
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,480
And I'm not saying this to everyone who took time off for an MMO, because some people are

3005
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:50,320
saying, oh, that sucks.

3006
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:52,000
Guess I'll do something else.

3007
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,360
That is the correct response.

3008
02:31:54,880 --> 02:32:00,080
But for the people that decide to tweet Yoshi P when he's literally crying on camera because

3009
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:04,480
he has to delay his game, that I, what about me?

3010
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:09,680
Shut the fuck up.

3011
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:10,960
All right.

3012
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:17,440
Uh, Mike Defton chat says, Yoshi P is a godsend and I don't even play Final Fantasy 14.

3013
02:32:17,440 --> 02:32:20,640
Garth the Wolf in chat says, Yoshi P cried while apologizing.

3014
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:21,840
He shouldn't have to feel that way.

3015
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:23,600
He's amazing and works so hard.

3016
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:27,600
How many times has Yoshi P put his heart on his fucking sleeve this year when we don't

3017
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:28,240
deserve it?

3018
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:33,920
Remember that whole thing, uh, a fan fest when he was talking about Soken and everything

3019
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,680
that Soken was going through medically.

3020
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:41,440
And like, wait, gaming does not deserve Yoshi P.

3021
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,320
And if you hurt that man's feelings, I will beat you up.

3022
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:49,120
He is a, he's a perfect cinnamon roll.

3023
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:54,800
I, I, I need to say for the purposes of Twitch, uh, rules and things I metaphorically, I will

3024
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:55,300
beat you up.

3025
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:59,120
I don't mean that literally for the purposes of Twitch things.

3026
02:32:59,120 --> 02:32:59,600
Yes.

3027
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,840
I will beat you up with, with words.

3028
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:03,280
Yoshi P is precious.

3029
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,840
He is a gift in this gaming industry.

3030
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:10,240
He is not here for your bullshit.

3031
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:11,360
And I will see to that.

3032
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:17,520
Comments in chat, DJ Rama S, are gamers entitled?

3033
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:17,840
Yes.

3034
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,640
Was that the website that Bobby had?

3035
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,240
What was the website that Bobby had?

3036
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:24,080
Are gamers mad?

3037
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:27,440
Are gamers, do gamers hate, gamers hate everything.

3038
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:27,760
That's it.

3039
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:28,960
Gamers hate everything.com.

3040
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:31,120
That, that was it.

3041
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:32,800
It took me a minute.

3042
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,600
My old brain.

3043
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:35,440
Thank you, Bobby.

3044
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:36,880
Gamers hate everything.com.

3045
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:37,360
What?

3046
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:38,960
You are not old gamer.

3047
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:40,400
Your game is not old.

3048
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:44,320
Can I, gamers are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.

3049
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:46,240
Gamers are not, I forbid it.

3050
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:46,960
What, you know what?

3051
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:53,280
If I'm gonna, if I'm gonna wield that 19 year thing around the room and this whole like

3052
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:58,000
where you know what, I'm going to decree that you are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.

3053
02:33:58,880 --> 02:33:59,440
Period.

3054
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:01,840
You're not a gamer.

3055
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:03,600
If you hate Yoshi P, you're not a gamer.

3056
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:05,200
You're not.

3057
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:07,760
I take, we take it away from you.

3058
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:09,040
What do you say chat?

3059
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,200
We, we strip away the gamer rights of those that hate Yoshi P.

3060
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:14,880
Down with that.

3061
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:15,520
How dare you?

3062
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:17,120
All right.

3063
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:19,360
Anyway, uh oh.

3064
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:21,440
I guess the site is currently broken.

3065
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:24,000
Gamer, gamers took out gamers hate everything.com.

3066
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:25,840
Good lord.

3067
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:30,720
Garth the Wolf would like to point out Final Fantasy 14 has the best stories to tell.

3068
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:32,640
The lead writer of the game is a woman.

3069
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:33,040
Yes.

3070
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,600
Uh, who also wrote shadow ringers, which was incredible.

3071
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,840
And the, the, the critically acclaimed MMO.

3072
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:38,560
She's fabulous.

3073
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:40,100
All right.

3074
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:41,120
Anyway.

3075
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:42,560
Okay.

3076
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,440
I've said enough.

3077
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:43,680
Yeah.

3078
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:44,160
I'm sorry.

3079
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:44,560
I'm sorry.

3080
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:48,160
I had some thoughts and some feelings and some opinions and I had to express them.

3081
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:50,160
You were entitled to that, Rob.

3082
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,320
No one's saying no for the record.

3083
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:54,160
You're joining me in this whole Yoshi.

3084
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:54,880
You're not allowed.

3085
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:57,280
If you hate Yoshi P, I will take your, you're not a gamer.

3086
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:58,800
You, that title is taken away, right?

3087
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,760
You're going to help me enforce this rule, right?

3088
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:03,680
Yeah, Rob.

3089
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:03,920
Sure.

3090
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:05,760
All right.

3091
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:07,280
What'd you want to say?

3092
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:10,640
Oh, for the record, I didn't get to have a pink drink today.

3093
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,040
I'm sorry for your loss.

3094
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,600
I had a beige drink instead.

3095
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:16,640
Oh, you poor thing.

3096
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:19,040
I had a green tea.

3097
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:21,040
My heart was broken, Rob.

3098
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:22,880
Were they out of pink drink?

3099
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:23,940
They were.

3100
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:30,580
Um, so I had my, my fallback, which was my ice chai latte with one pump of the apple syrup.

3101
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:31,540
Oh, good times.

3102
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:32,020
Good times.

3103
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,060
All right.

3104
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:33,460
Delicious.

3105
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:34,180
And I'm a genius.

3106
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:35,140
All right.

3107
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:38,900
Uh, Garth the Wolf in chat says chestnut praline latte is out.

3108
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:40,580
Yeah, that's a really good, that's a really good.

3109
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:42,340
I wish, wish I could get one soon.

3110
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:42,740
All right.

3111
02:35:42,740 --> 02:35:45,460
Um, anyway, uh, let's, let's wrap up.

3112
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:49,380
Um, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight and listening to it and listening

3113
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:53,300
to us make decrees and rules and bitch and complain.

3114
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:55,140
This is our access.

3115
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:57,780
Thank you for coming to our group therapy tonight.

3116
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:00,740
We appreciate something.

3117
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:05,940
Uh, that's, that's how the shows lasted 19 years.

3118
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:07,700
It's basically therapy.

3119
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:09,940
Uh, in a way it is sometimes.

3120
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:12,820
Uh, anyway, thank you guys for being here and thank you for tuning in.

3121
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:16,100
Whether you're like Ronnie and had been listening on the podcast feed for years and years and

3122
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:17,300
years and years and years.

3123
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:18,260
Thank you so much for that.

3124
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:23,060
If you've been listening live here at twitch.tv, uh, thank you very much for that as well.

3125
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:23,860
Appreciate you guys.

3126
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:25,700
However, you choose to listen to the show.

3127
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:28,660
If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

3128
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:31,220
Help us spread the word, a social media retweet.

3129
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:33,620
Uh, those types of things go a long way as well.

3130
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:34,660
Hosts on Twitch.

3131
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:38,420
That whole system is kind of weird right now, but we'll take it.

3132
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:40,100
If you want to host us on Twitch, please do.

3133
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:45,300
For, for the record on that point, I'm going to say better TV house has an option for you

3134
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:48,660
to add host channel when you are in somebody else's channel.

3135
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:52,340
Oh, it is very useful.

3136
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:56,260
If you're using better TTV and you don't see that it is an option that you can turn on

3137
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:57,060
in your settings.

3138
02:36:57,060 --> 02:37:00,660
Is better TTV like an add on somebody wrote to fix all the problems with TTV.

3139
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:06,500
Um, better TTV is actually for more icons than the standard, uh, ones that you get.

3140
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:09,380
I was using it for my no bill icon for a long time.

3141
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:13,380
And, uh, bourbon put up the no fang that I made.

3142
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:15,300
Interesting.

3143
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,020
I don't know about that.

3144
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:16,900
Yeah.

3145
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:19,620
I'll, I'll, I'll link you the stuff after I do my thing tonight.

3146
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:23,140
I know about the pronouns add on for, but that's about the only

3147
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:28,020
which doesn't work right in Safari.

3148
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:32,420
Although a lot of those things run through tamper monkey, but that I digress.

3149
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:33,940
Interesting.

3150
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:35,140
Okay.

3151
02:37:35,140 --> 02:37:38,100
Um, but anyway, uh, thank you very much for your support.

3152
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:42,260
If you feel so inclined, you can also visit the store, vog network.com slash shop, uh,

3153
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:44,900
pick up an OLR t-shirt just in time for the holidays.

3154
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:48,740
Say hello to a loved one with a Bobby black Wolf mug, which you can pick up at vog network.com

3155
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:52,740
slash shop or a cool little vog network, logo, uh, anything.

3156
02:37:52,740 --> 02:37:55,540
Um, maybe we should add a couple items before the holidays.

3157
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:55,940
We'll see.

3158
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:56,580
We'll see.

3159
02:37:56,580 --> 02:38:00,580
Uh, maybe if you're good, uh, check that out at vog network.com slash shop.

3160
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:03,540
And, uh, again, thank you so much for your support of the show.

3161
02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:04,980
It really does mean the world.

3162
02:38:04,980 --> 02:38:07,220
Uh, we'll be back next week to do it all again.

3163
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,660
Before we say good night, good night.

3164
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:11,380
We want to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3165
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:13,540
So let me go to dark soccer at first.

3166
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:15,780
I'll say, uh, your final thought first, before you head out.

3167
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:18,340
My stomach hurts a lot because I ate too much.

3168
02:38:18,340 --> 02:38:22,020
I had a taco and I had a donut and the donuts were cheap and half price over at Safeway.

3169
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:29,140
And I made a big mistake, choices, choices, but you got to eat a taco and a donut today

3170
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:30,660
in a way pretty cool.

3171
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:33,620
Remember no booping without consent.

3172
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,420
All right.

3173
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:35,300
Thank you to our soccer.

3174
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:39,700
And, uh, we look forward to the boops on your stream and just a little later for live listeners.

3175
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:40,180
So thanks.

3176
02:38:40,180 --> 02:38:40,680
Have a good one.

3177
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:41,860
All right.

3178
02:38:41,860 --> 02:38:43,860
And Loki, how about your final thought?

3179
02:38:44,820 --> 02:38:52,420
Uh, my final thought is if you haven't already go subscribe to my YouTube channel, uh, username

3180
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:55,780
Loki O R and check out my new video.

3181
02:38:56,340 --> 02:39:00,500
I've watched that, uh, time-lapse video that I filmed in there several times.

3182
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:02,340
It syncs up so well to the music.

3183
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:03,140
I love it.

3184
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:04,020
Go check it out.

3185
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:05,220
I made in Django city.

3186
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:06,260
All right.

3187
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:08,500
You know what you need to add to your channel though?

3188
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:13,060
If you want to try to get more people, add some of your funny ass rants on things like

3189
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:13,780
to your channel.

3190
02:39:13,780 --> 02:39:18,580
I think, I think you'd get a lot of just other, other audience that comes in non-Minecraft

3191
02:39:18,580 --> 02:39:18,820
people.

3192
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:21,460
You got to reach the non-Minecraft crowd somehow, but yes.

3193
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:22,820
All right.

3194
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:23,540
Uh, check it out.

3195
02:39:23,540 --> 02:39:25,780
I, of course I encourage all of our folks to check it out.

3196
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:29,220
Of course, of course you'll learn to love Minecraft with Loki.

3197
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:30,900
Uh, I guess I'll plug my channel too.

3198
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:32,660
I was very bad in broadcasting last week.

3199
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:34,020
I promise I have a good reason.

3200
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:36,740
I'm not going to talk about it right now, but I've just had a lot going on this last

3201
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:37,220
week.

3202
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:41,060
Um, but I I'm going to really try to get back on the wagon next week because I was doing

3203
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:42,820
so good with my post-work streams.

3204
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:46,260
So I'll plug myself at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

3205
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:46,980
Oh, and Twitter.

3206
02:39:46,980 --> 02:39:48,020
I fucking love Twitter.

3207
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:51,300
Just follow me on Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts, Mr Rob Roberts.

3208
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,220
Um, yeah, that's it.

3209
02:39:53,220 --> 02:39:54,980
That's going to do it for tonight's show.

3210
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:55,380
Thank you.

3211
02:39:55,940 --> 02:39:57,620
Um, we'll be back to do it again.

3212
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:00,900
I can't believe like it's November, 2021.

3213
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:08,020
Like this time since we flipped to virtual has just flown by like this whole pandemic

3214
02:40:08,020 --> 02:40:08,740
stuff.

3215
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,340
I get my booster next week.

3216
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:10,900
That's exciting.

3217
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:12,020
I got mine on Friday.

3218
02:40:12,020 --> 02:40:12,580
Congrats.

3219
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:15,060
Did you get boosted with J and J or did you get something else?

3220
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:16,180
No, Moderna.

3221
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:17,540
I know you hate shots.

3222
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:18,820
So that does take a lot.

3223
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:20,020
I do hate shots.

3224
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:20,580
Well, congrats.

3225
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,300
Thank you for doing it.

3226
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:25,140
It's like literally felt nothing from it.

3227
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:30,180
My arm was very mildly sore the next day.

3228
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:30,900
Oh, you didn't get it.

3229
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:32,500
You didn't get any side effects from Moderna otherwise?

3230
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:32,820
That's good.

3231
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:34,340
Because I got no side effects.

3232
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:34,900
I am good.

3233
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,740
I'm getting tic-tac-toe with Moderna.

3234
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:40,740
So I'm getting a Moderna shot on, uh, Thursday, I think.

3235
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:41,140
No, no.

3236
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:41,940
Thursday's a holiday.

3237
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:43,620
So I think I might get it Tuesday.

3238
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,020
I don't know.

3239
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:45,860
I don't fucking know time anymore.

3240
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:47,620
So but I'm going to get tic-tac-toe.

3241
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:49,380
So I'll have Moderna, Moderna, Moderna.

3242
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:53,220
So because that is my love of Dolly Parton and the vaccine

3243
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,420
that she helped fund.

3244
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:56,180
It's like getting the Moderna vaccine.

3245
02:40:57,460 --> 02:40:58,740
Get the vaccines.

3246
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:59,380
We're fine.

3247
02:41:00,100 --> 02:41:01,300
You will be too.

3248
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:04,180
And yes, Bobby Blackwell says, follow the VOG Network

3249
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:04,980
Twitter as well.

3250
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:05,380
Of course.

3251
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:08,900
I just figured you already were at VOG Network.

3252
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:09,940
Yes, yes.

3253
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:10,820
All right.

3254
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:11,860
Tic-tac-toe Derna.

3255
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:12,100
Yes.

3256
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:14,020
And Garth says that's Moderna is the half dose.

3257
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:14,420
All right.

3258
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:15,620
It's not vaccine launch radio.

3259
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:16,260
It's Orange launch radio.

3260
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:16,740
No, I'm sorry.

3261
02:41:16,740 --> 02:41:17,780
I didn't get Moderna.

3262
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:18,900
I got Pfizer.

3263
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,260
Oh, I confused myself.

3264
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:20,760
Liar.

3265
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:25,380
So I did get the Pfizer one and I felt nothing.

3266
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:27,380
But the point is you got the booster.

3267
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:27,860
I did.

3268
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:28,340
You did.

3269
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:28,660
All right.

3270
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:30,420
Awesome.

3271
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:33,220
Get vaccinated so we can have conventions again.

3272
02:41:33,220 --> 02:41:34,340
So we can have tournaments again.

3273
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:35,620
We can have arcades again.

3274
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:37,380
We've got to end this fucking pandemic.

3275
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:40,740
At least where you're if you're going to, if you're

3276
02:41:40,740 --> 02:41:43,460
because I realize there are there is a very, very small

3277
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:45,220
amount of people who literally can't get vaccinated

3278
02:41:45,220 --> 02:41:46,980
because, like, you know, they were recently on a medication

3279
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:47,480
or something.

3280
02:41:48,340 --> 02:41:49,540
At least wear your masks.

3281
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,180
