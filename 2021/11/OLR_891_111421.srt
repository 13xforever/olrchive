1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,400
I don't know if it's a sign at a time, it's a sign of my being less in the music

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,760
games community, if it's because we've had simulators with no cost for decades, but

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,560
Konami's PC gaming network has become a little bigger with the release of Dance Dance Revolution

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,600
Grand Prix and I haven't seen a lot of hype yet. The song list is incredible and as I've

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,200
loved about modern Bimani, updates will doubtlessly continue to come. This is the music game update,

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,600
possibly the last of the year, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers,

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,440
and Loki to bring you more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,440
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,440
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live with you once again

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:03,720
for episode number 891 of our show for this November the 14th of 2021. My name is Rob

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,280
Roberts and joining me as always, say hello first off to DarkSakura, but you can call

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
her Jamie Sommers. Hi.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Hi.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
How are you?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm all right. How are you?

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,920
I've had a few weeks. I've had a bit of a month. Maybe I'll talk about some of that

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,600
later, but yeah, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's been a time. Um, big things happening. Yeah.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah. Lots going on. Um, lots going on in video games too. Um, I know a little later

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,080
in the show, we're going to talk about some of the issues that have come up as a problem

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,080
with the dead by daylight, um, test realm, but funny enough, the part that we're probably

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,520
not going to talk about as much. So I'll talk about it now is the actual new killer and

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,840
survivor that were announced for the game, the artist. And I'm curious about your thoughts.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,960
We have guy ferry. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Uh, no, actually FBI agent, whatever. I mean, I'm

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,960
glad we have another, uh, Latino character. Yes. And actually we have two new Latin characters.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,040
So I'm Carmina, the artist, first of all, I love her. I love her story and I love her

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,580
level. Yeah. It was like three different surrealist paintings like in one, like you can see bits

28
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,940
of a Dali in the, you know, the Sandy landscape and the shape of the trees and her little

29
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,020
cathedral inside is almost perfectly based off of an Escher painting. And this week is

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,280
the week that the Hawkins laboratory map is going away in dead by daylight because the

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,620
stranger things license will be lost for the marketplace in the game. Uh, this week the

32
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,700
offerings are already gone, right? Yeah. The offerings are gone. And, um, but, but, uh,

33
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,460
of course, uh, to, to clarify, if you've already purchased Nancy Steve or the killer, the Demigorgon,

34
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,940
you will get to keep that. It's just, you can no longer buy them. Yeah. You can no longer

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,980
buy them after a Friday. I think it's the big day that that is all being pulled. So

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,220
anyway, we also know though that there's also Jonathan who's only available as a cosmetic,

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,740
right? Um, so we're losing Hawkins laboratory as a level, but this, you know, which is,

38
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,620
you know, in a way it's kind of like, I know people have very strong feelings about indoor

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,780
maps. And I think, but I think Hawkins is superior to Leary's in my opinion, the other

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:26,020
doctor, whatever. Um, but, uh, uh, like I said, everybody has their opinion, but I think

41
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,980
this new map, which is an indoor, it's outdoor, mostly outdoor, it has a few indoor parts.

42
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,540
It's mostly outdoor. I think his new map is like, Oh, this is so damn good. It makes up

43
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,620
for losing Hawkins. They need to finish, fix the lighting issues on the indoor though.

44
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,740
Because it's almost unplayable without improving your brightness or having some sort of filter.

45
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,260
It's very dark. Yeah. And it's on the test build for now. So, you know, there's lots

46
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,260
of changes to come, but, um, that's just the point of the test build is to get feedback

47
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,740
from the people playing it. And I was just, I was just curious, your early thoughts, of

48
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,540
course, the killer and survivor won't release for probably another two, three weeks, but,

49
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,820
um, it's nice useless. He's loud. He's large. And I'm not saying this in terms of, Oh yeah,

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,780
he's a big guy. Cause I mean, I think it's good that we have more representation, but

51
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,580
from a tactical standpoint, he's a large guy, which makes him an easier target. He is very

52
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:29,140
loud. And honestly, I don't think his perks are all that great. However, Carmina is perfect

53
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:41,900
all around her. Her bird attack puts the chains, the axes, and the, the traps all to shame.

54
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,820
I think as far as the survivor goes, his perk that extends the run by two seconds. Um, when

55
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,540
you get hit, I think that is a lot more, that's basically a sprint burst at the time you need

56
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,980
sprint burst. And so I think that's kinda, um, I think that'll be the perk people want,

57
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,020
but we'll see. A good killer is going to be able to compensate for it easy. Most killers

58
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,300
are going to be able to catch up on that extra two seconds anyway. I don't always go up against

59
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,580
good killers. All right. Anyway, uh, let's say hello to someone who doesn't play quite

60
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,540
as much dead by daylight, but it plays a lot of other stuff. Certainly Minecraft and, and

61
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,980
a game we're going to talk about tonight. Uh, hey, hi tech master Loki. I don't play

62
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,380
any dead by daylight. No. Oh, you don't play any dead by day. Well, no, I know you have

63
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,820
to buy the game in order to play it. Yes. Um, that's okay. I know there's people listen

64
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,900
to this show. It's all right. Do they have it on games pass? I mean, yes, that's how

65
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,900
I started it. Uh, dead by daylight is on a game pass for PC or windows store and a X

66
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,500
box. That's how I started playing. That's how I got into it is I was like, Oh, well,

67
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,780
Alan's used to really like this game. It's free on game pass. What do I have to lose?

68
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,180
And well, apparently hours and hours and hours of my time, uh, is what I have to lose, but

69
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:07,060
Hey, here we go. Isn't that the way with video games? It is. Yeah, definitely. So what's

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,740
the game you have playing behind you tonight? I feel like I've seen it before. Yeah, you

71
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,780
have seen it before. And, and it's, it's shoddy glory. We have, uh, the grant has auto definitive

72
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,300
edition. I think this is just grant the thought of three right now, but it is a long play

73
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,620
video. It might be all three. I don't know. Yeah. Um, I'm going to ask dark soccer to

74
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,180
kick us off tonight in our discussion about everything that's going on with all of this.

75
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,860
First I do want to say hello to our chatters. Um, hi folks over at twitch.tv slash VOG network

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,820
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right

77
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,280
after the Bobby black Wolf show. Hello. Hello. Hello to all of you. I've seen some new people

78
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,100
in chat tonight. So hello to the new folks, whether you're a long time podcaster, first

79
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,780
time Twitch viewer or whatever you've been lurking. Hello. Hello. All the same and welcome

80
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,260
to our happy. Oh, that could be it too. Hello from Minecraft. Hello from dead by daylight

81
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,020
and my streams star Sakura streams. Who knows where people come from, but welcome. Welcome.

82
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,300
Uh, I want to say thank you. Thank you because I see a level five hype train going on and

83
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,620
it takes, it takes a lot of biddies and subs to get to a level five hype train. So I would

84
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,980
just want to do acknowledge that and say thank you. I will, I, I, we are taping a podcast.

85
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,260
I haven't kind of given this disclaimer in a little while. So just a reminder, we are

86
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,420
taping a podcast here and um, I know usually on Twitch, if you're like playing a game or

87
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,780
something, you usually kind of stop what you're doing and you stop and go, Hey, thanks

88
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,540
pod culture for the gift subs, you know, and stuff like that. And, and we really, we do

89
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,660
have when we're live, we do have a ticker bar at the bottom that kind of shows that

90
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,260
information that's going on. But since we are taping a podcast, we don't like to interrupt

91
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,380
every 15 seconds with what we're talking about and say that. So we will say it all at the

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,340
very, very, very end. And please know we appreciate it all the same. And I just do want to say

93
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,860
thank you, uh, for LA hype train going on right now. Okay. So let's talk about the train

94
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,740
that derailed this week and that is the grand theft auto remasters. And, um, yeah, Loki,

95
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,060
Loki, Loki said so, well, you didn't say that it was going to be a disaster, but you kind

96
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,300
of said like, this is not going to be good. They would put the minimal amount of effort

97
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,300
in. Yeah. And yes, yes. And so, yes, yes, I would agree with that. That is some, that

98
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,700
is the sentiment you've said they would put the minimal amount of effort in and, uh, that

99
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,380
is showing in all sorts of ways, dark Sakura, you have one very interesting way that effort

100
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,460
question Mark is showing up, right? Yeah. Um, I just thought like the moment I read

101
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,740
it, I actually laughed my ass off. And then I thought about it. I was like, actually,

102
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:53,500
that's probably not too much fun. Um, apparently the rain is so hard in GTA trilogy that it

103
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:03,580
it's unplayable. Um, someone put out a graphic comparison, uh, between the two and, you know,

104
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,860
it looks like the remaster was looking pretty good and everything, but when the effects

105
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,980
came out though, the effects were really negatively impacted. Um, the dynamic weather, you know,

106
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,460
which, which is really cool for immersion, get you into the game, make it seem like a

107
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,300
real world, but in the new version of San Andreas, the rainstorms are absolutely terrible.

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:34,140
Um, like people are describing it as it makes my eyes hurt or I'm running in a flash flood.

109
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:42,060
You know, um, it, it turns basically city rain into, you know, Alabama. It's a heavy

110
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,380
rain. Yes, it's a heavy rain. You'll just want to run around screaming, Jason, Jason,

111
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,220
look at it story wise. Well, this is supposed to be like somewhere in California, right?

112
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,100
California doesn't get rain like that. Not often. I mean, I was looking at the video

113
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,900
and this is, this is Alabama rain. This is the rain I grew up with.

114
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,340
People here would just go inside and never leave the house if it rained like that here.

115
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,060
So to be fair, that storm that happened up here, the, the, the day I was at Disneyland,

116
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,540
thank you very much, where it was a nice sunny day. Apparently that storm was kind of like that.

117
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,220
I missed it all. So thanks. I didn't want to be here. Even bad storms here. Don't get Alabama bad.

118
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,140
Um, over in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, our voiceover guy VX Jason,

119
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:44,860
V says what? Get it. Uh, let's see. Dr. Chui in chat says I saw some of it via one of the

120
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,660
YouTube folks I follow. Yeah. The rain was one of the things covered among a long list of others.

121
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh yes. We'll get into some more. I want to, I want to save a nice slice of this pie for Loki

122
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,020
here. Uh, and let's see Questbuster in chat says it sounds like it met their benchmark for being

123
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,660
minimally viable. I don't know from my, from my perspective. Yeah, sure. It probably met

124
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,260
the conditions for minimum minimally viable, but, um, that doesn't also make a good product,

125
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,820
but I also think it was, it met their conditions for having the computer do all the work for you

126
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,220
for better or for worse. Like I, I feel like the Loki, you tell me if I'm right or wrong.

127
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,020
I feel like grand theft auto remaster is what happens when you let that little kid from the

128
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,900
old G four commercials that goes, I'm going to go to programming school and learn how to just

129
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,700
turn up the graphics on level three with the little computer dial. Right. The grand theft

130
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,460
auto remaster, it's even worse than that. Cause like, let's not like insult indie developers.

131
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,660
I mean, Jesus, like I think that they would put more care into it. But no, no, no, no. The,

132
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,780
the grand theft auto remaster is what happens when you turn the graphics up on level three

133
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,420
using a dial. They turn the grand theft. They turn the graphics up using a lot of computer

134
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,140
automation, if I'm not mistaken here and a lot of stuff using this dial and this is what you get.

135
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:14,220
Yeah. So they did several things that were not great. Um, a lot of it, I think using AI to

136
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,500
upscale different things. I know one of the things that was pointed out in a video that I saw,

137
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,220
because I haven't purchased this game. I'm not playing on purchasing it anytime soon. Um,

138
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,820
show the record. You love grand theft auto. I do love grant and people don't, people,

139
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,340
not everybody may know this cause we have listeners that have listened for two episodes.

140
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,820
We have listeners that have listened for 890 episodes. Um, you love grand theft auto,

141
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,900
like to the point when grand theft auto four, I used to love grand theft auto to the point.

142
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,780
Yeah. Fair, fair. When grand theft auto four was all the rage on Xbox 360, you were in the top

143
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:56,140
100 players in the world. And there were millions of people to play on that.

144
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,780
And it doesn't, and that's, that's the thing that's scary is because they're the, well,

145
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,860
we'll get to it, but like the rumor is that's the next one to get remastered. Like, uh, don't

146
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:14,860
do that. Um, but yeah, so they did a lot of automation to try and using AI to improve the

147
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,820
graphics in the game, which sometimes works. We've seen that with like fan mods and stuff like that,

148
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,820
where they'll take like final fantasy seven or something like that and upscale all the background

149
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,860
images and stuff like that. Uh, well, they use this to also upscale like text in the game,

150
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,500
like in the actual background and stuff. And it did its best, but it also misspelled things

151
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,140
because some text was illegible for the AI to be able to translate it correctly and upscale it.

152
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,540
So you have things like, you know, there's an auto shop thing and it's talking about like

153
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,740
gear maintenance or something like that. And it says bear maintenance instead. It's just like

154
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,740
weird stuff. Um, then you have like the weird character models, which I have no idea what's

155
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,380
wrong with that, but they're, there's something that's for sure. Um, they increase the draw

156
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,940
distance, which is good, but they also removed all the fog, which makes the game look really weird.

157
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,580
And it's not that they can't do the fog because you can actually put the cheat code to make

158
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:20,300
foggy. And it looks fine when you do it like that. Um, but anyway, so let's, let's start off

159
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,060
with kind of the stuff that, uh, has been going on. So the PC version of the game has the rockstar

160
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,340
games launcher app, which I really hate that they have that, but for the rockstar social club,

161
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,780
they have their own launcher app, and this is how you're able to play grand theft auto.

162
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,660
So if you purchased it on PC, um, you may have noticed that the launcher app went offline. It

163
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,820
just stopped working for a little bit. Finally, they were able to bring it back online. However,

164
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,620
you can't play grand theft auto anymore. That game you just purchased, you can't play

165
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,780
the whole definitive edition. Um, it has been taken offline because the route removing some

166
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,540
unintended data files that were included in the game. What are those data files? You may ask?

167
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:17,980
Well, it is basically a master cut of the, well, basically the full grand theft auto,

168
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,580
San Andreas. So you may remember a while back that there was the whole hot coffee mod thing,

169
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,540
and there's additional scripts that were unused, but they were still included in the game. Well,

170
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,300
this has that, uh, those same scripts, they have removed some of the models and stuff from the

171
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:41,260
game, but they also included, um, dev comments, cut content, um, a whole bunch of stuff. That's

172
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:47,980
just weird that it's even in there, but being the fact that they got in trouble with the hot coffee

173
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,460
thing, even though it wasn't something you can play in the game, um, being that that code was

174
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,260
there, they got, you know, that game had an AO rating and apparently also all of the audio,

175
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,860
um, the music tracks that got cut in this version of the game as well are still on within there,

176
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,980
but they're disabled by scripts. So how hard would it be for someone to modify that? Who knows,

177
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,260
but there's, yeah, definitely a lot of issues. I think on the modder question, we're about to find

178
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,980
out, um, quest buster kind of going back to the rain thing, uh, brings up in our chat at twitch

179
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,620
TV slash vog network quest buster says after modders were chased away by rockstar in the

180
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,260
proceeding months, I've read that modders have already started working on fixing the rain.

181
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:39,660
This is hilarious to me that modders who take to have really gone out of their way to piss off

182
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,380
are now going to be the ones that are going to start fixing the game that blows my mind.

183
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,500
Just this week, they already had more DMCA strikes against modders. So for example,

184
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,020
they had three mods that were kind of taken down because of this, one of those being GTA advanced

185
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:05,260
PC port. Um, so what that is, is basically converting, uh, GTA advance, which was only

186
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:13,820
on the game boy advance into the, um, the GTA three engine. And then also they had the lost

187
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:20,460
and damned unlocked, which was basically the DLC for granted out for, but there's stuff that was

188
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,540
cut from that. And so it's kind of restoring that. And then oddly enough, um, a grand theft out of

189
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:34,140
four episodes of Liberty city, lost them, damn 65% complete save file, which isn't even a mod.

190
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,420
It's just a save file so that you can start with the game 65% complete. I don't get that one. Um,

191
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,340
I don't even understand how they can take this stuff down. Like it's just, it's, it's ridiculous,

192
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,580
just what they're doing here. But obviously it, it signals to me that they're looking to

193
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:00,540
do more of these remasters. Um, I'm, you know, maybe they shouldn't or well, maybe

194
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,180
whoever, whatever team was doing it so that this wasn't done by them necessarily in house. It was

195
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,780
done by some Grove street studios or something like that, which Grove street does a reference

196
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:19,500
to San Andreas. Um, I don't know if it's like a spinoff internal studio type thing, but basically,

197
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,620
you know, this is a team that was handling it and it's just, it's such a mess. Like,

198
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,180
I'm sure there were a lot of people working very hard on this who didn't have enough time

199
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,300
that I it's gotta be with this. It's always what it comes down to.

200
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,060
Somebody at the top wanted to get this out a lot faster than what was, what real was realistically

201
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,020
possible because they don't, they don't know what all really goes into it.

202
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,580
And like some of the character models though, that they did in the game, like they just look

203
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,940
terrible. Like the originals look better than this. Like, I just don't understand what choice

204
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,540
I understand, you know, maybe not making them look realistic. Fine. But like just the direction

205
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,460
that they went with is so weird. I just don't get it. Well, I think there's, uh, they were expecting

206
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,140
this to be a huge holiday title for them. And I think this backlash is gonna, you know, let's,

207
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,300
let's re this. Here we go. Here's our cyberpunk 2077 for the year. Here it is. There's always

208
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,820
some game around the holiday season that shouldn't have come out for the holidays.

209
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,540
Not even just this game. There's a lot of games out right now that just came out recently that

210
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,460
are a giant mess. And it's just consistent that we see this all the time. We have studios just

211
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,220
rushing games out and then apologizing later about the state that they're out in.

212
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,060
It would be less like, I'd be less angry about it if it were, if they weren't like coming down

213
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,780
on modders to like, you know, they're trying to just improve the game and like, well, they don't

214
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,540
have to, no, I understand they don't, but I get it. But like, but at the same time, some of these

215
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,900
projects that they're doing aren't necessarily hurting anything, I think, but they feel

216
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,900
differently, obviously with their games, I'm kind of locking that stuff down.

217
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,780
I think the modders shouldn't help them, but you know what? It's not my time. It's not my effort.

218
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,140
It's not my choice, but it's, you know, and I'm, I'm not, certainly a lot of these folks are

219
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,900
extremely talented what they're doing with the mods, especially, you know, so quickly on the

220
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,460
game. So I'm, I'm certainly not going to talk down or bad about them, but I just, I certainly

221
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,460
wouldn't be making the same choice. I'd be playing something else and modding something else right

222
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,460
now. But, um, I get it, I guess, you know, when you love something that much, you want to see it

223
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,260
succeed and you'll do anything to try to nudge it in the right direction, even when it maybe doesn't

224
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:43,500
deserve it. Yeah. Um, let's see, um, Bobby Black Wolf with a fair point on that whole thing saying

225
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,420
modders are helping out of spite so they can give a big middle finger to rockstar. I understand what

226
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,300
it's like to be motivated by spite. So I'll give you that fair. That might, that may be the whole

227
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:01,260
thing. Um, SSG100 Matt with a funny, uh, OLR history tidbit. Hot coffee controversy was first

228
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,740
mentioned for the first time on the show on episode 197. That was July 11th, 2005 per the Wiki.

229
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,660
Thank you for that little update. So yes, what's old is new again. There we are.

230
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,260
Huh? I was just looking that up. I guess it's just a coincidence about the, the name of that.

231
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,660
But aside from, you know, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy, so they've, they've done, um,

232
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,700
the bully scholarship edition, which was done not that long ago. And then arc survival evolved on,

233
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,020
no, nevermind this, I think not the judge, but I think this kind of explains it. So they've

234
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,020
been working on mobile ports of these games. So arc survival evolved on iOS and Android and bully

235
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:52,860
anniversary edition on iOS and Android, uh, Chinatown wars, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

236
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:01,500
So they actually did the ports for San Andreas on, um, on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 as

237
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,300
well. Hmm. But yeah, they've been mainly working on, uh, iOS and Android ports of

238
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:14,140
the Grand Theft Auto, actually any of the rockstar game stuff. Interesting. Very.

239
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,300
So what happens now? Uh, Loki, what do you think? Where do we go from here? Like,

240
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,180
does take two just have to write off that? Well, those millions of copies we expected to sell are

241
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,180
going to get reduced because the internet figured out we cut too many corners with this. Um,

242
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:38,860
maybe they'll come back and fix the issues. I don't know if people even care at that point.

243
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,780
Somebody brought up great. We were talking about that. Well, hold on. Cause we were talking about

244
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,860
this on Twitter and somebody had jumped in and replied, I think you were tagged in this too,

245
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:53,980
and said, whatever happened with cyberpunk 2077 anyway? Like, and, and in a way, good question.

246
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,620
What did ever happen with that? No one talks about it anymore. It's still be,

247
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,900
well, the people talk about still, but it's just still in progress. Like they've already pushed

248
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,100
back once again, the PlayStation five and X-Box series X versions of the game. Um,

249
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:16,060
I don't know. I don't think any DLC has been worked on any, you know, recently they're still

250
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,020
putting out patches. I haven't played the game in over a year. Um, well not over a year because I

251
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,660
don't think it was out then, but about a year. I mean, shortly after it came out, I stopped playing

252
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:32,700
it and just kind of waiting for all the patches to be done. But yeah, I mean, I, I would love to

253
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:40,300
see the, I would love to see a remaster of four. Just not like this. Just please don't break it.

254
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,860
I would love to see four come back with death match. Oh God. I would love to have the death

255
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,340
match back like it was before, but they won't do it. She Hulk 10 in our chat brings up a good point

256
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,700
that, uh, refunds refunds. Uh, that's another thing that take to us deal with all this,

257
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,180
just like, you know, what happened with CD project red now, maybe not on that same scale

258
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,820
with CD project red. Cause that got really ugly. Well, and this, this story may not be done.

259
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,580
We'll see. Um, it took a few weeks for the, the cyberpunk, uh, issues to get there. But, um,

260
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,100
with the refund thing, you know, uh, we see people taking advantage of that, uh, already on, uh,

261
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:24,460
you know, on this game. So that's going to be interesting. All right. Uh, and, and lastly,

262
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,180
we'll close with this question here. Um, SSJ 100, Matt says, so how much did Loki laugh

263
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,340
maniacally when he saw this? I didn't, it was more like kind of figured this was going to be

264
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,820
the case. It's just, I don't know. I kind of like, I'm, I'm surprised just that the,

265
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,580
how bad it is like, cause some of the like remaster stuff that they've done, wasn't too

266
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,860
bad. Like I want to say like the X, and this same company worked on it, like the X-Box three 60

267
00:24:52,860 --> 00:25:02,060
version of Sandra's wasn't super bad. Um, I'm just, I'm really surprised at like, like even

268
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,180
like, let's just say, let's just take it back. Like the absolute bare minimum, like we just up

269
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:13,420
scaled the graphics in the game. Maybe not even necessarily the models. Oh, so here's,

270
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,460
here's one that was also like, like, how could they get this so wrong? So I was watching, uh,

271
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:25,020
a video showing gameplay of this, um, being done by Matt, or was it Matt McMuscles? Uh,

272
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,820
he does a bunch of like, uh, funny like critique videos and stuff like that. And so he's showing

273
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,220
gameplay of Grand Theft Auto three and all of the audio in the game is like slowed down. Like,

274
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,900
it's really weird. And he's re he like, he's like, I rebooted my system. I restarted the

275
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,860
game. It's still doing this. And he was playing on, I don't remember, maybe in the switch. Um,

276
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,100
but there, no, it wasn't a sweet, it was one of the console versus PlayStation

277
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,260
five, maybe, or our X-Box series X. And yeah, it was just the audio is just like all distorted

278
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,660
and just like really deep, like everybody. It was weird. Um, but like, that's what I'm talking about.

279
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,620
Like that's the bare minimum and you gotta, you're right. Just pour it over the audio as it was

280
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,260
before. Like, why is the playback speed wrong? Like that's something that you should have caught

281
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,500
in testing. That's not something like, well, we'll fix it later. You know, that that's bad.

282
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,820
I think to go back to the original comment too, about laughing maniacally, it's, it's one of those

283
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,620
things where it's like, I don't know if we take pleasure in this news. I don't take pleasure in

284
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,260
it. Yeah. It's but it's really frustrating. Like kind of like Loki kind of, as we started off

285
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,540
talking about when you kind of saw it coming and like when we see this happen too much in this

286
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,620
industry where these projects are not given the time that they need or the manpower or the

287
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,020
resources or the investment that they need in order to be successful. And it's a bummer.

288
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,140
Yeah. It's just, it's a matter of looking at, I mean, let's not say that Rockstar Games doesn't

289
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,900
put any effort into Grand Theft Auto. They put in a lot of effort into, I don't have a lot of effort,

290
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,060
but they put in some effort into Grand Theft Auto Online because that's where they're making their

291
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,740
money. That's why I figured like when we're talking about a new version coming out, a remaster

292
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,940
or whatever, I wasn't expecting like a ton of changes. It was just kind of, you know, the bare

293
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,380
minimum. That said though, I mean, when we're talking about companies, they're putting the

294
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,380
bare minimum and re-release their games a billion times. At least, you know, the new Skyrim game

295
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,340
looks, you know, pretty good. I mean, considering that they didn't really do too much to it,

296
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,420
they just kind of slightly improved the graphics a bit and added a bunch of paid mods in there.

297
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,620
It still probably plays better. It's probably a better, you know, purchase versus what we got here

298
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:50,940
with Grand Theft Auto. A game that they're charging $60 for, by the way, for that.

299
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:58,380
Well, not if you're upgrading from a prior version. I get your point. I get it. All right.

300
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,140
Let's move on though. Let's talk about, we got other gaming news to get into and we will,

301
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,820
but it's always good to check in and see what types of games we have been playing this week

302
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,260
in a segment we call How Is Your Gaming Week? So let's go back to Dark Sakura. And I'm guessing

303
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,780
she probably hasn't played a lot of Grand Theft Auto, but we'll see what she has been playing

304
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,260
in your gaming week. I haven't actually touched Animal Crossing yet, which I'm really kind of

305
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,860
upset with myself about, but I've had a lot going on. So it's just basically been Dead by Daylight

306
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:36,220
and Fantasian. Though I found an RPG I might be starting called Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion.

307
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,900
That sounds fun. And I found a version of Power Washing Simulator for Mac. So I might be starting

308
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,340
that. That's fine. I love that game. I've been eating something just a little bit mindless to

309
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,660
sit back with after work. It is extremely mindless, extremely. I haven't played it in a while, but

310
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,700
it's extremely mindless. Well, the other thing going on is that I may have a period coming up

311
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,020
where I'm off work for about three weeks and I am thinking about doing a stream every day.

312
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Ooh, that's a big challenge. So I can get that stream for 25 or 30 days

313
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:21,660
achievement. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, right now, I can talk about it later,

314
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:29,100
but I've got stuff coming up soon that it's going to require me to be off all of my meds.

315
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,260
Look out world. Cold turkey. Well, let us know how we can help. If we can help. Probably just

316
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,700
don't talk to me. Well, if you have to take time off the show or something, let us know whatever

317
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:50,300
we had to do. We'll see. We'll see. But at any rate, I will probably be playing and cussing at

318
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:58,700
a lot of games during that time period. And I will let everyone know. All right. Well, if that's it

319
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,660
for your gaming week, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week? So my week was pretty much just

320
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:10,620
playing Minecraft. I've been really trying to hustle to put out my next video. So I've been

321
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,500
working on that. I have a large build that I did. Probably a little bit too large for one video,

322
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:23,180
but yeah, I've also distracted myself by playing on another server as well. So I've been doing

323
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,820
that. Probably splitting my time between two servers is not the best thing to get weekly

324
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:35,820
videos out. But you know, it's fine. And then what else? So I've been thinking a lot about

325
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:43,980
doing the about the physical release of Pixel Poops number two. So we've got this Sacramento,

326
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,220
they have like a game expo thing, classic game expo, not really classic game expo. It's like a

327
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,460
gaming expo that they do in December. It's a mini convention. Yeah. Yeah. I like mini convention.

328
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:00,620
I went to it last year. It's pretty fun. But they've got a lot of like retro collector

329
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,220
YouTubers and personalities that are going to be attending as well. And I think it might be a good

330
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,540
idea to hand out some physical freebies for them. Get your game in front of people. Absolutely.

331
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:23,260
YYR, I would imagine. I mean, hopefully he's listening and can confirm or deny with a tweet

332
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,020
or something. But going to Magfest and getting that game, his various games in front of people,

333
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,780
like nothing sells that super multitasking like playing it and showing it to people like that's

334
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,500
how you sell that game. And so I think that's a big thing. Yeah. And I think especially if you're

335
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,580
going to go to a game gaming show and say, here is this game that I made and you can buy it right

336
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,220
now, scan this QR code or pay me ten dollars. Well, you'd have to have a vendor license for

337
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,300
that. So you want to get careful with that stuff. Yeah, they had this. And I thought about that.

338
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I just don't think I'd be able to attend both days. So that's why I haven't been doing it. But

339
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,780
yeah, they've got like I'm trying to think who was there. But, you know, like Pat the NES punk.

340
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,220
Oh, you want to get your game in front of people the other way by actually giving them

341
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,700
copies of stuff to check out. It's clever. Yeah. They get people talking about it. Sure.

342
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Because it's like I've seen a lot of like press coverage of like different games that

343
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,300
pretty much have to do a Kickstarter to do get like the coverage because

344
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,580
people see all sorts of different NES projects and they like make articles about it and stuff

345
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:37,740
because it's a thing to talk about. A game about people pooping on stuff is the NES is going to

346
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,940
make articles and that has clickbait material. It's just like, can you believe what's coming

347
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:49,900
on the NES? I mean, just. Can you believe this poop? I see dark soccer trying to drop a zinger,

348
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,820
but you're muted. You should have a catchphrase. Just get shit on. Get shit on.

349
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,900
But yeah, something like that, just need to put it out there. I do want to make physical copies,

350
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:10,780
though. I have to check. I need to really like source like packaging and whatnot. There's like

351
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,700
different companies you can work with. Like, I know the one that they got the coverage on

352
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:22,540
broke studios is to actually purchase my hard my actual boards through and they also do publishing

353
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,060
as well. I just don't know how you you how you get that kind of an agreement. There's other

354
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,460
like companies, too, that'll do like kind of publishing. I even see like a little limited

355
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,700
run games and stuff will do. Sure. You know, publishing and stuff like that for NES things.

356
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,100
I just don't know who to talk to for that kind of stuff, but maybe start broke studios. But

357
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,100
there's that there was was at the that magazine thing. So I have to figure out when that's coming

358
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:56,460
out. There's the. There's another nest maker, like not really competition, but they do this

359
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,820
thing every year that's almost like a game jam, but this year they're not doing a game jam because

360
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,500
of the weird scenario of raising. So they're basically saying you can like submit your game

361
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,220
from any game like brand new. It's been out for a while. You publish it already.

362
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,820
You can submit as part of this kind of event thing and then they'll do awards and whatnot.

363
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:27,820
So I did that for this year and eventually I'm hoping they get their retroverse set up going

364
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,500
because that's supposed to be like a portal where you can actually play games online. You purchase

365
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,620
through there and eventually they'll do like, you know, actual physical publishing of different

366
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:44,220
things. That'd be really convenient. But it's going to be a while. So, yeah, I'm still thinking

367
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:51,020
about it. I just have to. Figure out the logistics for it. All right, that's pretty much it.

368
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,980
Let's talk about my gaming week. So for my gaming week, I have been continuing to play Pikmin Bloom,

369
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,060
which had a community event on Saturday yesterday, which was kind of interesting that that game

370
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,300
didn't launch that long ago and it's already having a community event because that game is

371
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,900
a little more passive in the way that it plays. You know, the community event was kind of the

372
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,020
same way. It was really just, you know, get 10,000 steps within this day for a special badge. But if

373
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:22,780
you are checking the game, the flowers are kind of blooming rarer stuff. I didn't see it, but a

374
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,020
friend of mine got a rose to spawn, which I didn't even know roses were in the game. But I mean,

375
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,500
makes sense in a game that has a lot of flower stuff. So I guess that was spawning in some

376
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,140
circumstances and so forth. So there's a lot of neat stuff going on. And, you know, I've been

377
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,180
talking about Pikmin Bloom a lot and I'm like, what is it about this game that, you know, I just

378
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,660
keep coming back to? Is it because it is very much a set it and forget it kind of thing? And,

379
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,340
you know, it's a little bit of everything, but, you know, just being able to incentivize the

380
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,540
walking and, you know, encourage me to get more steps and, you know, get out and exercise and do

381
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,940
all that. This game landed really at the right time for me. Something I've talked about on

382
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,740
social media this past week, which I guess I should probably bring up here because not all

383
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,260
of you follow me on social media. I don't know why. You're certainly making a choice. No, I'm

384
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:15,420
kidding. I get it. But something I talked about in a lengthy post earlier this week is that around

385
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:22,860
Halloween, I found out I have type 2 diabetes, which is probably not a thing that you associate

386
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,060
with. You know, everybody thinks of Wilford Brimley, right? The old guy from the Cocoon

387
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,100
movie and that stuff and those commercials. So you don't always associate that, but with

388
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,540
being a little bit younger, I don't think I'm old. I think I'm still pretty young all things

389
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,700
considered. So that was kind of a shock and a shitty thing to find out. And I could sit here

390
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,820
and dwell on all the, why did this happen? Genetics. My grandma had it. You know, how,

391
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,180
you know, and all this stuff. But I just kind of have to take this news.

392
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,980
And with your other issues with having pancreatitis before.

393
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,340
Oh, sure.

394
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,460
I think that there's a definite link if you were having troubles with processing

395
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,180
fats that you're going to have trouble processing sugars.

396
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,820
Yeah. But it's, you know, and again, the weird part was is that, you know, again,

397
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,380
I've been tested just as part of like a regular blood panel pretty much every year,

398
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,460
except last year, because I don't think anyone was going to the doctor's office last year.

399
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,700
There wasn't a vaccine yet, et cetera, et cetera. So I had labs done in 2018,

400
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:31,260
completely normal. 2019, completely normal. 2020, pandemic. Now this year,

401
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,500
some symptoms start to show up. I get my blood to complete type 2 diabetes,

402
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,620
not even a pre-stage, which a lot of people kind of find out for. In two years, I went from normal

403
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,780
to wow. And it sucks. And there's no, you know, easy way for me to say it.

404
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:53,100
I also try to remain humble and, you know, so forth in the fact that there's a lot of people

405
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,340
I know with type 1 diabetes who have had it since they were very young. And, you know,

406
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,900
it's just something they've been dealing with their entire lives. I have had 43 years of,

407
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,060
you know, having it okay. So and now just, you know, this is the thing that I have to take on

408
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:14,860
and try to, I don't know if, you know, I don't know. I've heard some things that you can kind

409
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,580
of reverse it and kind of put it in remission. You can kind of put it to sleep for a long time.

410
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm trying not to kid or fool myself. But I'm trying to definitely turn the tide the other

411
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,140
direction. And walking, exercise, making that a part of my routine again, because

412
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,980
since the pandemic happened, and here's something that's changed in the past two years,

413
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,780
I haven't been exercising as much. I'll go on big walks once in a while. I still do think,

414
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:47,820
but when I was working in the office, I would walk on like every break. And I haven't really

415
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,980
been doing that since I've been working from home. I think a lot of people have kind of changed a lot

416
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:58,140
of their lifestyle stuff. And that's what allowed those sorts of things to happen in just two years.

417
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,380
So my point is, as much as that news sucks, and I'm dealing with it and processing it,

418
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,700
and thank you. I see several of you in chat saying, I'm dealing with this too. So thank

419
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:18,700
you. And I really appreciate that. And I see you. Is this whole, okay, if I'm going to do this thing

420
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,180
and I'm going to take this head on, am I going to take it seriously? And I'm going to walk

421
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,580
and make sure I'm getting my 30 minutes of exercise every single day. Pikmin has been

422
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,780
hugely, at the right time, instrumental in motivating me to get out and get some steps

423
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,460
and cook these little Pikmin and hatch them and set them off on their missions and all that crap.

424
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,740
So if it seems like I'm talking about this game a lot, it's because it was exactly what I needed

425
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:53,820
at the right time, whether it's a good game or not. So I think that's a lot of that. Anyhow,

426
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,020
other games that I've been playing this week, I've been playing Forza Horizon 5,

427
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:09,260
because that just came out for everybody this week. Oh, get it, get it. It is magnificent.

428
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,700
I mean, and these games are always set up so well that in the first 10 minutes during the

429
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:22,380
introduction, it's like this fucking game, cars flying out of planes, into volcanoes,

430
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:28,140
racing down, doing jumps, whoosh, another car dropping out of a plane. Now you're, I mean,

431
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:38,060
way to show off the game in like 10 minutes. What a masterpiece of the hook, hooking people into

432
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,660
wanting to play more of this game. And then, you know, once you really get going and you get

433
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,300
settled in the game, it's really lovely that it's like this open world you can do. I mean,

434
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,740
has the formula changed from Forza Horizon 4? Not really. It's more of the same. But I asked you,

435
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:59,900
is that a bad thing? Because Forza Horizon 4 was a fucking marvelous game. Obviously, the biggest

436
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,380
change with Forza Horizon 5 is it's a new setting. It's Mexico. Lends itself wonderfully to a

437
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:12,780
varying environment and things I don't always think about when it comes to, you know, going

438
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,780
to visit Mexico. I wasn't thinking about volcanoes in Mexico ever. I don't associate Mexico with

439
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:26,380
that. But that was really cool. No. I associated with resorts and the beach and that's represented

440
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,620
too in the game. I've never been, that's never been what I've associated Mexico with. I've

441
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:38,540
always had to remind myself that they exist. So everybody has their own things, right? And what

442
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:45,180
a beautiful piece of art to put all of that diversity in Mexico on display front and center.

443
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,100
One thing I really caught in the opening credits of the game was that there was a partnership with

444
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,860
like the Mexican Tourism Board. I don't think that's the actual name of it, but that's what

445
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:03,740
it is. This game partnered with the Mexican Tourism Board and I 150% get why. Because this game

446
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:13,500
will make you want to go to Mexico. It's gorgeous. It looks great. It'll make you want to more.

447
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:21,020
It looks great. And it's just, it's more of that. And you know, the game itself, great. I don't

448
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:27,660
really know what I can say about it. Like it is a top of the line racing game, not a simulator,

449
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,620
more of an arcade, but there are so many types of difficulty sliders and accessibility things.

450
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,940
So you can make this game as easy or as hard as you want. You can make this game as easy as like,

451
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,780
push the accelerator and the rest of the work is done for you mostly. You know, it really depends

452
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,500
on what you're looking for in your game, but it's just such a nice little, I'm going to play this

453
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,220
game for five minutes, do one little race, and then I'm done. Or I'm going to play this game

454
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,780
for three hours and I'm going to do every single little event in this area and find every little

455
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,780
board and every little thing. I'm going to do all of this stuff. And that's what I'm going to

456
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:11,900
do in the game today. This game is magnificent. It is a must play. Forza Horizon is Microsoft's

457
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:22,460
flagship series. If you were thinking it was Halo, I'm not so sure anymore. But the nice thing is,

458
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,700
it's great that Microsoft is at a point where this is even a discussion because for so many

459
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,980
I've heard, you know, Microsoft is nothing but shooty, shooty, bang, bang, Halo,

460
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:40,700
sports types of games. There's nothing on Xbox for me. And if that is, and I've said this before,

461
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:46,700
and with the release of this game, if you are going to continue to say that in the face of

462
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:55,100
this game, I really need you to get your ass out of 2007 and look at what Microsoft is doing now

463
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:04,380
in 2021. It is much different and this game is an achievement. It is absolutely game of the year

464
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,540
material and I absolutely expect it to show up on the shortlist when we start talking about five

465
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:17,180
games nominated for game of the year. This game will be one of them. The only complaint I see

466
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,180
that people will have about this game is that it's not doing that much more that four didn't already

467
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:31,980
bring to the table. I suppose that's a valid criticism. However, if you eat a cookie and it's

468
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,420
really good, like this is the best fucking cookie you've ever had in your life, don't you just want

469
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,220
to have another cookie? Like, maybe this is, maybe I shouldn't be the one making this analogy right

470
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:53,980
now, but it's all I can think of. It's great. Anyway, let's see, TigerClodChat says,

471
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,180
Halo is overrated. It's all about the Forza now. I think depending on who you are, yeah,

472
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:04,300
and there'll be people that will say that, no, the Microsoft franchise is Gears. Gears is better than

473
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,540
Halo for the following reason, or the flagship series is, you know, Ori and the Blind Forest,

474
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,460
or the Ori series, which I certainly would not fault you for saying that either.

475
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:23,340
I think the interesting thing about this game is that more than anything, I was sitting here

476
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:32,060
playing this game going, this studio, and this engine, and this concept of do a little, do a lot,

477
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:40,300
do a quest over here, a quest over there. This is the new Fable studio. This studio is working

478
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:46,460
on the new Fable game. I'm very excited about that. My expectations for the new Fable game are

479
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:53,020
so fucking high right now, and I know, and I am the first one to say, don't get your expectations

480
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:04,700
out of control for games ever. Too late. No, I can't, Dark Sakura, because this game is too good.

481
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,540
It just sets up, you know, like Fable, like I imagine what Fable can be within this,

482
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,940
and it's just, I'm like, I'm so excited, and the bar is so high, and it is Playground Studio's fault

483
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:29,420
for doing that. So, anyway, Mr. Izos in chat says, never played a Forza Horizon game, but man,

484
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,380
watching videos and reading reviews, I'm going to get this for sure. Looks really fun. Best argument

485
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,540
for Game Pass right now. Incredible argument for Game Pass right now. So anyway, Forza Horizon 5,

486
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,220
it's great. Rob Roberts said the quote, put it on the back of the box. It's great.

487
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:52,140
Um, we have a club here at VOG Network, so if you search for the tag V-O-G, which I don't think

488
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,940
people could repeat tags, so I think we grabbed it. I don't know what else uses that acronym,

489
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:06,300
but okay. Maybe there's fans of that volcano and the fog that it produces, but that tag is now ours

490
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,300
at the Voicegeeks Network. So we do have a club, so I encourage you to look it up if you are playing

491
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,940
Forza Horizon 5. I'm hoping to, in the coming weeks, I don't want to promise next week,

492
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,780
obviously, with what I just told you and everything, I've been dealing with a lot lately,

493
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,260
but hopefully things will settle down in the next couple weeks, and we can look at maybe doing like

494
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:31,020
a Forza night here on the stream and, you know, play together and all that stuff. So, we'll see.

495
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,460
The other thing I want to point out, one other game I played this week, and Loki,

496
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,900
I really thought of you because this really seemed like the type of game that was up your alley.

497
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,300
It was on Game Pass, so it was one of those things when I was scrolling through to see what's new,

498
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,620
I saw this and I was like, okay, I have to check this out. It's a game called Kill It With Fire.

499
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:56,140
Have you seen this? I know what the game is, yes. I've heard of it. Okay, so you start in this

500
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:02,220
little house and then what happens, these spiders show up and you will stop at nothing to kill these

501
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,900
spiders, meaning you're throwing televisions at them, you're throwing game consoles at them,

502
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,380
you are breaking bookshelves, and then at some point you find a can of hairspray in a match and

503
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,340
you're setting things on fire, but with the all-important purpose of killing these little

504
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:23,740
fuckers. And what a brilliant concept for a game, because how many times has somebody said to you,

505
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,060
oh my god, I just saw a spider, and your response is, well, you got to burn the house down now.

506
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:33,100
Like, you know, somebody literally made a game out of that little joke, and so that's really cute.

507
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:40,540
I'm gonna be honest, it didn't play, it didn't snap as well as I, like, I was throwing the TV

508
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,500
at the spider many times because I just, I'm not sure if I was understanding the trick on how to

509
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,220
do it or what the deal is. It's much easier when I have a gun, and yes, at the end of the first level

510
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,820
you get a gun and you start shooting the spiders, that I get, but like, I was, until I looked up and

511
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:01,980
saw that this game was originally made for mobile devices, and so I was like, oh, you were, you were

512
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,860
probably, yeah, you were probably throwing the furniture, well, at least, or it came out on

513
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,180
mobile devices, so you're probably throwing the furniture like pokeballs, and it probably

514
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,420
kind of plays a little bit better in that regard on a mobile device. So that's my little-

515
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,780
What if you like spiders?

516
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:21,980
Then don't play this game, because you do nothing but kill them in this game, so that's it. And the

517
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,620
little music will come up and, you know, like, it's really funny. Like, there's a lot of the

518
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:32,700
presentation that's really well done in the game, but I just, I had, I felt it was very unforgiving

519
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,620
in its first level in just, like, how to play it, but at the same time, you can't lose it either.

520
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,860
Like, they're not poisonous spiders who, like, try to bite you or eat you or anything, so there is,

521
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:48,700
or at least not in the first level. I don't know what happens beyond that yet, but yeah, I felt,

522
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,300
it just took me too damn long to kind of get through that first level, because it was kind of

523
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:59,020
hard. So that's my only kind of thing there, but I love the idea as a concept for a game,

524
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,540
and maybe in a sequel, especially if they kind of have the consoles in mind,

525
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,820
maybe they'll kind of be able to make something that snaps a little more, and hopefully this game,

526
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,700
you know, does well for them, so. Okay, I think that's about it for my gaming week. I've talked

527
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:22,220
enough. No. Me? Talk? All right, let's get into some other gaming news. Let's get to Loki,

528
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,860
and starting us off with news. I was trying to think if there's any housekeeping. I don't think

529
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,540
we have any tonight, so we'll just get right out into some other. Okay. Never mind. It's not big.

530
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,740
Are you sure? Okay. Sure. All right, then let's go to Loki with our headline tonight.

531
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,700
Yeah, so the Steam Deck has been delayed, unfortunately, and it's thanks to the wonderful

532
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:49,180
chip shortage that we're still in in the middle of, so supply and change and whatnot. I think,

533
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:55,820
though, it's only being delayed, though, until, well, a few months. So, they're going to start

534
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:02,780
shipping to customers starting February 2022. So, if you obviously were in queue to get,

535
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,260
you know, a Steam Deck around that time, it's going to be pushed back even further, obviously.

536
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,620
So, it's about two months delay, but at least it's still coming to be expected, I suppose.

537
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:24,540
Along with that, the little indie kind of handheld play date has been delayed to 2022 because the

538
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:30,540
battery life on the first units that they put out weren't very long, and they are looking to improve

539
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:37,100
that. So, that's too bad. I hope you weren't looking for new hardware this year. I'm surprised

540
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,980
that the battery life on that would be pretty low because the type of screen that has on there,

541
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,460
it's got like one of those old e-reader screens, kind of like the e-papers type things.

542
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,660
I'm surprised. I don't think those are very battery draining, but I guess.

543
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,980
Well, it sounds like the creators were a little surprised that it couldn't get better battery

544
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,860
life either. So, you know, they were very transparent, you know, with all their reasons.

545
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,660
It's hard to read what those Playdate creators kind of put out there and not like understand

546
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:11,500
what's happening. It's a level of transparency, I bet we wish, from a lot of gaming companies.

547
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,700
At least they're willing to fix the mistakes and not just push it out the door.

548
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,660
Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, yeah, I'm sure this Stream Deck news is frustrating for a lot of

549
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:27,260
people, but then, you know, you look at this as the yin to the story we just talked about at the

550
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:32,300
top of the show, Yang, and it's like, all right, push it back because it's got to be, well, and if

551
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,020
literally the parts aren't there or the parts are not arriving to get them done, it's also kind of

552
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:45,100
like we literally can't make them. So what do we do? You know, that's it. So that's, you know,

553
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,780
it's a bummer for the folks that we're looking forward to those for the holiday or even early

554
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,820
2022. But maybe it'll just help them be that much better by the time they're released.

555
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,020
Yes, that's what we've got to tell ourselves, right? I would love to get one of the I want

556
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,460
to see really what the I have a few friends that pre-ordered that Playdate. I have some that did

557
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,660
the Stream Deck too, or sorry, Steam Deck. The Stream Deck is a different thing. I had some that

558
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:15,180
ordered the Steam Deck and I'm curious to see that. I really am. But I'm really, really curious

559
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,900
for this Playdate because the games on Steam Deck, I know what they're all going to be. I've played

560
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,420
all those games. I'm curious about what and the crank and everything that like what this Playdate

561
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,820
really kind of brings to the table. I'm very curious to see, you know, for an indie, you know,

562
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,140
again, I know it's not competing with the likes of the Nintendo Switch or anything. It is very much

563
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,980
an indie console. But I'm curious for that reason what it brings to the table. A lot of the indies

564
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:47,100
have brought a lot of good shit to the table. So, yeah, be interesting. All right. Moving on,

565
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:55,740
let's talk about what's going on with Dead by Daylight. So we talked a little bit, Dark Soccer

566
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:01,100
and I talked about how the public test build came out earlier this week and it featured a brand new

567
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:09,020
killer, the artist and a brand new survivor who's a CIA agent. And that talk aside, because it

568
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,940
doesn't matter, you know, some of you guys love it when we talk to it by daylight. Some of you are

569
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,660
like, fast forward, fast forward. And like, look, they're talking about that Debbie person again.

570
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:23,260
No matter where you are on the issue, this is not what you think because this isn't really about the

571
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:29,340
game itself. But it's about a problem that is recurring in the gaming scene and it's showing

572
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:34,940
up in a really nasty way this week because of the Dead by Daylight public test build. And what's

573
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,900
happening is that Dead by Daylight streamers are getting attacked with denial of service attacks,

574
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:47,100
sometimes known as DDoS attacks, also doxing and in some pretty extreme and shitty cases,

575
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:56,140
swatting. So let's see, some tweets and things that have gone out. A YouTuber named John Wolf

576
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:01,180
sent out a tweet getting DDoSed repeatedly on stream tonight. So that was fun. Not sure I'll

577
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,260
be streaming tomorrow unless I can figure out how to prevent it. I've had people DDoS the game

578
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,820
server I was playing on before, but this was an attack on my home network. Any advice would be

579
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:16,060
appreciated, by the way. So here's the thing is that when you play on the public test build,

580
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,780
as I understand it in dark soccer, you'll feel free to jump in if you have a different

581
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,820
understanding. But when you're playing the live game Dead by Daylight, you are connecting to a

582
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,060
server and then everything is happening through the server. In the public test build, you are

583
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,820
connecting peer to peer, which I think is what Dead by Daylight used to be in the first year or

584
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:43,340
two. And then it went to the server and now the public test build is done again, peer to peer.

585
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:50,220
And that correct. Yeah. Okay. So that means when you get match made with strangers,

586
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:57,500
you can't it doesn't show their IP, but you can find it because you're connected to them in a

587
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:04,060
peer to peer environment. A lot of people that play Dead by Daylight, more so than a lot of

588
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,980
other games out there, it happens a lot of other games, too. But what's unique to this situation,

589
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:14,860
you get a lot of people that put TTV in their name or YT in their name to show that they are

590
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:21,180
a Twitch streamer, because some people like to watch and go back and see what was the match from

591
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,140
the killer's perspective or something like that. That is a lot of fun to watch sometimes. In fact,

592
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:32,780
not to digress too much, but I just have to say two streamers that I enjoy and I know Dark Soccer,

593
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:40,220
you really love these folks, too. Losing color, went up against Puddins and his mod squad,

594
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:46,620
which included epic, which includes Flea, who sometimes is here at or high if you're out there.

595
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:51,260
But anyway. Yeah. And Flea streams, too. So a shout out for his streams. But the point is

596
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,060
those two got randomly not in the PTV, but I just want to tell us this and decide those two got

597
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:03,100
randomly matched against each other. And because the killer can see who the survivors are losing

598
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:11,820
color knew right away. It's Puddins. The others didn't know until, oh, God, it's a nurse. Oh,

599
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,780
God, it's a good nurse. They guessed, though. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was watching Puddins

600
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:22,620
when it happened. I wasn't active in chat. And I was in LC's chat. And Puddins had the

601
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:28,300
rain or they saw the rainbow flag and they were like, oh, they said, somebody check losing color

602
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:33,500
stream. Is he live? And somebody came back and said, yep, he's live. And like, Puddins put out

603
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:39,340
this off. Fuck, it's over. Like type of thing. But anyway, I tell you all that because there is a lot

604
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,180
of enjoyment. And you know what I did after I watched that match on Puddins and watch the

605
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:49,340
survivor and losing color cleaned house, of course, on that match, because, oh, yeah. Well,

606
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,220
they did. And Puddins team made the mistake. They didn't know because they don't know who the killer

607
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:01,500
is or what. They played the best. They played losing colors. Absolute favorite map. They played

608
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,660
the offering for that map because they had a different game plan in mind. They didn't know

609
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:11,660
it would be nurse and losing color. So when losing color saw that offering pop up, he was like a

610
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,580
present. Anyway, it was pretty funny. Well, and I was like, oh, my God, I know everybody in this

611
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:23,820
party. So I had the both of them open side by side. I know this because I watch and then I

612
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,820
went immediately back and I watched losing color. I watched on on their channel, too. And it was

613
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:33,180
really fun to watch it from both sides. That's why people put TV in their name, because there's

614
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,340
a lot of survivors. I know that if they find out the killer was a TV here, they go back and watch

615
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,700
it from the killer's perspective to see where they fucked up. And I think that's kind of neat.

616
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,060
And vice versa. You can do vice versa to Jamie that one time during one of your charity streams,

617
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:51,260
you like to be one three V ones and played against me. I went back and watched you play the match

618
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,660
because I wanted to see I got you real good with a pebble at one point. And I wanted to see what

619
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,380
that looked like on your end because I don't really know. So anyway, did you not hear me

620
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:06,140
say I bet this is a pebble and I went anyway? You did. You did. Anyway, that was fun. Anyway,

621
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:11,820
my point is. People put TV for that positive good reason, it helps grow their community,

622
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,300
but now we're seeing the bad side of this. They're forgetting to remove the TV when they

623
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,780
go on public test build because they're not necessarily thinking about this. This isn't

624
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:26,140
at the forefront of their mind. And now people are seeing here's your IP address and you're a

625
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:33,580
TTV or and now some people are doing a denial of service attack or, you know, multiple packets

626
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:40,540
flinging at the server and such as this YouTuber step did. However, these are VPNs and that's what

627
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:45,580
a lot of people are saying. Also, I want to mention this is very important to there is an option in

628
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:51,020
steam and I in the moment I forget where it is. Dark soccer. Maybe you know from from seeing this

629
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:57,980
there is an option in steam you can configure that says do not show my IP under any circumstance.

630
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:03,660
It will make it longer for you to get a match. But as far as I'm concerned, hearing about this,

631
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:09,980
who cares? Two times are long anyway. Take the few extra seconds. Hide your IP. That is an option

632
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:17,020
available to you in steam. I feel like and I'm not techie enough to know this. I'm going to

633
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:22,140
defer to chat on this and I'm not in our discord. We have a lot of great tech people that tweet us

634
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:28,140
and describe it. Couldn't they still packet sniff it out? Even if you're hiding your IP?

635
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,020
If it's clear to appear, you always have that risk. If you're like someone that's playing

636
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:38,700
in that match or whatever, you could probably sniff out the other person's IP. But if you use

637
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:45,740
a VPN, it's not going to matter. So I may argue that steam functionality may actually not be easy.

638
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:50,460
It may not be enough if they really want to get you. But I am not technical minded to really say

639
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,340
yes, no one way or the other. My real advice is do not put TTV or YT in your name when you're on

640
01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:01,260
the test realm. That's that's my humble opinion. I don't even I don't have the option to change

641
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,220
my name and I don't want to do it. Yeah, same. I don't want to do it at all. And I play on Stadia,

642
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:13,420
which if you want a protected experience and not have to wait for updates and not have to

643
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,300
deal with some of the bullshit like steam maintenance, play on Stadia.

644
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:26,220
Now, there's more to this story. It's not just DDoS. Another streamer who I'm familiar with,

645
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:32,940
but I can't confess I've watched a lot of. Elex? Yeah, Elex. There is a lot of people that enjoy

646
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:38,780
and please absolutely. I've been reading her tweets. Yeah. If I could absolutely no disrespect

647
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,340
when I say I don't I just there's so many great people on Twitch and so little time to watch them

648
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:49,260
all. I am familiar with with Elex, but I'm not super familiar. But it is one of those things

649
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,540
where I'm like, oh, that's a friend of a friend. I know this. I know of this person. Right. You

650
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,500
know how that sometimes that right. You feel like two degrees separated from this. So Elex,

651
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,500
who does a lot of streaming and drag and I think is very well known for being a very adept Hag

652
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,660
player in the game, which is one of the killers. Hag is the one that draws the traps on the ground.

653
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:17,100
Elex was swatted during PTB while live and like has the receipts to prove it showed the

654
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,180
because I did see this make its way around, because, again, I follow people that are in

655
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:27,260
Elex's circles. I saw the retweets of like the blink security camera footage of Elex walking

656
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:32,300
out the door with their hands up. But I thought, you know, what was the really fascinating part

657
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,380
of this story? One of the cops recognized Elex from Dead by Daylight streaming and knew what

658
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:45,260
was happening at that moment. Yeah. So nice, but very much. Yeah. It's into the ruler. Yeah,

659
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:52,780
it doesn't. Yeah, no. And it it's just a really phenomenal like twist in the story.

660
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:58,700
But it certainly does not change. It's shitty. I'm sure it was scary and absolutely unnecessary

661
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:06,220
for Elex. And it's a horrible situation. Here's what I don't understand. And I have to ask my

662
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:12,300
tech people. I'm going to confess. I am ignorant to this. I need to understand this so that it

663
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:19,980
doesn't happen to me. So Loki help. Chatters help. How does Elex's IP getting out lead to swatting?

664
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,820
I didn't know you could pinpoint somebody's home address with an IP address. How did they do that?

665
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,740
I've done it before. I haven't swatted anybody I'm saying, but remember when Timmy, his buddy,

666
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:40,140
was doing targeted harassment at me. I found the IP address. That was a long time ago. Holy moly.

667
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:48,140
Yeah. And it was attached to his home address. How? When I replied back, this was a while ago

668
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:53,500
when it was a lot less security on the web. Okay. But to be fair, that's not where we're

669
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,860
at now. I appreciate the insight, but I still don't understand. How do we get there?

670
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:05,820
But I'm saying the possibility is still out there. Especially if you've got contacts,

671
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:11,340
if you have other methods of doing it, it's still out there. You can get a home address from an IP

672
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:17,100
if you're not using a VPN. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about it or how that's possible, but

673
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:22,940
Like me, I'm actually installing a VPN. Oh, yeah. And there's a lot of them out there.

674
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,580
So yeah. Pod Culture and Chat says you can go through the ISP, but if you're Danny Dickhead,

675
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:31,580
you can't just call Comcast and say, I need to find out who's at this IP address. They're not

676
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:37,980
going to give it to you. So I'm not understanding. I mean, clearly it's possible. Unless you say

677
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,700
someone from this IP address issued this threat and send that to the police.

678
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:49,740
Hmm. I don't think that would work. It would work actually.

679
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:57,020
I here's, here's, here's why I bring it up is that I wonder if Elex wasn't targeted

680
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:03,100
before this public test build stuff and kind of maybe outside of that. And it just kind of

681
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,900
happened to time up with that. Again, I want to make very clear. This is a disgusting thing that

682
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:13,900
happened. The swatting business needs to stop. Danny Dickhead and whoever is making these calls,

683
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:19,900
they need to be brought to justice and spanked publicly. And I, you know, I can mean that in,

684
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,500
you know, whatever way you want to interpret that as far as what the punishment ought to be.

685
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:30,540
But was it really cause of public test build or has, has somebody been working on doing this for

686
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:35,980
a while? Unfortunately, it doesn't either way. It's not right. It's yeah, it's still disgusting

687
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:40,540
at the end of the day, but I just, I'm not understanding how an IP address leads to within

688
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:48,060
the same evening, the cops showing up, but here's what I do want to say. And by the way, I do want

689
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:53,100
to shout out, uh, Jason, uh, over in our chat room did point out the way to do that and steam

690
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:58,140
and hide the IP address. Thank you. Steam preferences, in game tab, steam networking

691
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:04,780
set to never. If you're paranoid in a rightly minded way, you can also do friends only and

692
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:10,620
always he points out default is an option, whatever that means. So I think default is

693
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:15,980
always, yeah, that's kind of where I'm at to default. I've had my set for friends only for

694
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:22,860
a while. That's that's then again, that should be dead by daylight on steam on steam. True, true.

695
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,340
Yeah. You know what? Actually, you probably don't need a VPN. You're playing through stadia.

696
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:32,140
Oh, you can't do test build through stadia though. You're going to have to do exactly.

697
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:38,620
You're going to have to, okay, you can't do test. But, but I do play other things and I do play a

698
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:49,340
few things on steam still, and I play other MMOs. And so I want to have a VPN for specific purposes.

699
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:55,900
I want to have the option of using it. So I'm reading this story about the whole thing

700
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:03,260
and there's a passage in and I'm looking at this story was reported everywhere. I did a search on

701
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:08,620
Google News and this article at gamerant.com came up about this whole thing. And there's a sentence

702
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:14,860
in here I want to address. A paragraph. Tech savvy individuals who may have dealt with such cyberware

703
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:19,740
vulnerabilities before suggests a VPN which allows for encrypted private networking as a default line

704
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:25,500
of defense. Okay. Yep. It is currently unclear why dead by daylight streamers are being targeted

705
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:30,940
specifically, though it has ensued rampantly in the past week across a seemingly indiscriminate

706
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:35,340
number of streamers. So perhaps it is a security breach that has been left vulnerable through the

707
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:40,860
game itself. I'd like to address that sentence. It is currently unclear why dead by daylight

708
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:46,220
streamers are being targeted specifically. I'd like to propose an answer and it's not what you

709
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:53,420
want to hear. Dark Sakura, I bet our answers are the exact same. Why are dead by daylight streamers

710
01:07:53,500 --> 01:08:03,340
being targeted? They are targeting anyone with the LGBTQIA tag or people of color or gender variant.

711
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:09,660
Because it is. Yeah, they are targeting dead by daylight streamers because dead by daylight

712
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:17,180
is extremely popular amongst all of those minority groups. That's the unfortunate truth.

713
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:24,300
So, Game Rant, I think you should update your article. No one wants to say this out loud,

714
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:29,500
but I think we have to. So, Game Rant, I think you should say it, too. This is why dead by

715
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:35,580
daylight streamers are being targeted. This is why Elex, a drag performer, was likely targeted

716
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:41,500
well before the public test build stuff. And I mean, I know it's a big elephant in the room,

717
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:46,620
right? Yep. It's a big elephant. But you're not going to get it out of the room until you

718
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:52,380
recognize that it's there and haul it out, right? And if that kill it with fire game taught us

719
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:59,260
anything, you need to find that spider, move the couch, shine a light on it, and then spray it with

720
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:04,860
fire. And that's the only way we're going to be able to do it. Spiders eat mosquitoes, Rob. They

721
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:12,700
deserve to live. They're fake spiders. I love that here we are talking about a game dead by daylight

722
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:18,380
where on a daily basis, you're in there murdering people horrifically. And you're like, but spiders.

723
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,620
Well, spiders. People are terrible. Spiders are awesome.

724
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,460
Unless they're funnel webs and then get them far away from me. They'll get one of

725
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,780
this. They'll have a spider as one of the killers here pretty soon. Oh, I can't wait.

726
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,220
Now, one other, sorry, I know I've talked a lot about this story, but it's a lot going on here.

727
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,380
And obviously this is a community I've spent a lot of time with. Behavior Interactive, who are

728
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,460
the developers of the game, it's called out that they're not really, they haven't really tweeted

729
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:52,220
about it. They haven't said anything about it. They're not really quote unquote doing anything

730
01:09:52,220 --> 01:10:00,620
about this. I have to admit, like, look, there's a lot of things we could ask Behavior about and how

731
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:06,700
they run their business. What do you want them to do? What do they, the only thing that they can do

732
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,820
is change their PTB streaming. To change it from-

733
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,580
To server. They could.

734
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:18,140
Make it server instead of peer to peer. And adding it to server then means that it opens up

735
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,820
PTB for people on console and streaming services.

736
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:29,820
Yeah. But what otherwise do you want them to do? Do you want them to send a tweet saying,

737
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:37,980
don't swat people? Like, why should companies have to tweet out, be a decent fucking human being?

738
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:44,940
Like we don't have that same expectation for Xbox to tweet out, hey, don't be an asshole on Xbox Live.

739
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,140
Be less of a dick, see who plays.

740
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:52,860
And you know, I have a catchy, you know, I have a catchy catchphrase for their public campaign.

741
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,020
It's just, what, how about not?

742
01:10:55,020 --> 01:11:00,540
I don't want to laugh because it's not a laughing matter.

743
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,460
So that was pretty funny.

744
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,460
So screw you for that joke. All right.

745
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,060
It's called gallows humor. It's allowed.

746
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,260
Yes, I get it. Laughing at funerals and all that stuff. Sometimes it's

747
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:15,980
the only thing you know how to do. I mean, sure, Behavior should probably say,

748
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:20,540
hey, warning, you might want to take these precautions when playing on the public test

749
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,700
build. We want to remind our audience when you play on the PTB, these things happen.

750
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:29,820
I guess I could see Behavior kind of doing that, but I think y'all that are tweeting in all caps

751
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:35,500
at them are not making your message clear. You just want, you want Behavior to say something.

752
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,260
What do you want them to say? Guess what? All gamers need to hear it.

753
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,540
All people need to hear it. Don't be a shit.

754
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:51,980
And people are also trying to bring Twitch in on this because it is predominantly streamers being

755
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:58,140
targeted. But the thing is that in this particular case, Twitch is actually fairly innocent.

756
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,820
I don't know how they can control their viewers necessarily. I mean, you can't,

757
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,700
you can't. Well, they're comparing it to the hate raids.

758
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:11,500
We, this is those solely having to do with the dead by daylight PTB.

759
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,940
We need and what we need, the person we need to make a statement on this

760
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:22,620
is your local Congress representative. And guess what? Most of them aren't going to give a fuck

761
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:28,060
because they're going to go, oh, that's a Gen Z thing. Well, Gen X here to tell you,

762
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:33,820
number one, we need more representation of different generations within Congress and

763
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:38,620
making these types of decisions for this reason. This is one of the many reasons why,

764
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,860
no matter whether you're liberal, conservative, somewhere in between,

765
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:49,980
this is why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was extremely possible, possible, extremely popular

766
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:55,020
when she went to Twitch and did her stream with the other representatives that she did that with

767
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:01,740
and so forth, because she was speaking a language a lot of people wish their politicians would speak.

768
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,100
She was addressing people in a way that, you know, there's a whole, there's many, many,

769
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:12,380
many people here on Twitch. So anyway, my point with this is we need our Congress people to

770
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:16,540
understand that this is an issue. And I do see, and it is important to say S200 Matt in chat says,

771
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:20,140
swatting is already a federal crime, yet these pieces of trash continue to do it.

772
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:23,820
They're so full of themselves that they can get away with it while they eventually get caught.

773
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:29,420
A lot of damage is already done by that time. That is why parents of minors need to be held

774
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:35,900
responsible in these circumstances. That is the federal legislation that ought to be out there,

775
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:40,620
for sure. Parents of minors who are committing these offenses need to be held responsible.

776
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:45,580
And I know that, I know politically that's not going to land with all of you and I'll just smile

777
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:53,340
and nod and say, then how do we end this? That's not the only step we need to take. The offenses

778
01:13:53,340 --> 01:14:01,180
for this, you know, need to go higher. The way to track these sorts of reports needs to be higher.

779
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:09,500
I'm going to actually say that parents and children doing this should both be sent to jail.

780
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:16,380
If somebody with a four digit internet number playing dead by daylight can be tracked to their

781
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:23,980
address, why can't someone phoning in or internetting in a report? The government's

782
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,540
technology needs to catch the fuck up. And that's the other thing that needs to happen.

783
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,460
That's why the Congress people have to get involved.

784
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,700
They can't just call in all these fake swaths from anonymous numbers.

785
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:39,500
That's it. SG100 Matt saying our internet crime response networks are still playing catch up a

786
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:47,180
lot of the time. And that's the problem. We need to invest in that. Okay. I've talked a lot, a lot,

787
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:51,740
a lot about that. Anyhow, there's more gaming news to get into. So I'm going to kick it over

788
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:57,980
to the next story, Dark Sakura. So Quantic Dream

789
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:03,100
is a company that, well, I may not have been fans of some of their practices, but I fucking

790
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:10,780
love Detroit Become Human. I'm actually rewatching the whole good playthrough again from a PS5

791
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:23,420
recording. But there is a big rumor with quite a bit of evidence behind it, that they are working

792
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:34,620
on a Star Wars High Republic era game with the name Eclipse. They're going to call it Star Wars

793
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:41,580
Eclipse. And then it was corroborated by some pretty reliable industry insiders.

794
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:49,820
And also there is evidence that now Quantic Dream has finished their contract with Sony.

795
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:55,420
They're signing with Disney for projects, which would make it absolutely right that they do a

796
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:05,180
Star Wars game. But I mean, the theory is that it is going to be a lot more action oriented than

797
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:13,580
just the QuickTime event control every last little thing somebody does game like Heavy Rain or Beyond

798
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:19,980
Two Souls or Detroit. It's definitely going to be more of an action game. And they're also

799
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:26,540
talking about there being open world and multiplayer elements to it. But while a lot has

800
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:39,340
been peripherally corroborated, I'm still not going to be too behind it until I see more evidence.

801
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,940
I mean, the people on the inside, the people in the know are saying all evidence points to yes

802
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:54,220
on their Magic 8 Ball. So it's one of those rumors with a lot of fire around it right now. So yeah,

803
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,060
I got a text message from one of my friends super into Star Wars that was like, why didn't you tell

804
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,460
me about this? And I was like, I literally didn't know until today when I was looking at the notes

805
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:08,460
for this week's show. And it's still in a rumor status, really. So yeah, well, in High Republic

806
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:14,540
games, I mean, there were all of those books, you know, but I think all of the books were

807
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:21,820
rendered like alternate universe now are no longer official canon. So maybe this is going

808
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:26,460
to be part of a way that they can write what their official canon is going to be for this. I don't

809
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:35,900
know. E3 Vialant. Oh, sorry. I was just going to say, given the quality of their other titles for

810
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:41,500
the technology it was released on, I would have really high hopes for how this game turns out.

811
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,340
Is it all going to be about like Senate debates? Because that would be amazing.

812
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:51,820
This is an action oriented game. There's not much action in the Senate.

813
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:56,300
There's lots of action in Senate debates. That was the best part of the original trilogy.

814
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:02,700
Unless someone brings out a lightsaber and takes offense at the Senator from Tatooine. I don't

815
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:10,060
know. I have trade agreements and stuff like that. I can't wait. I'm filing this report on you.

816
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,860
There was a comment in chat by E3 Vialant. It wasn't about Star Wars directly, but it was

817
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:19,180
because Disney, Marvel and all that got brought up. E3 Vialant did bring up the current Guardians

818
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:23,900
of the Galaxy has a good story. Yeah. You know, I have to say I haven't played that game myself yet,

819
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:29,100
but I'm considering a few people were kind of apprehensive about that after like Avengers and

820
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:35,340
some of the other, like it turns out that that game is landing really well with a lot of people.

821
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,500
And I got to say, I'm interested in it in a way out and I've never seen the movies. And that's

822
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:45,420
probably why it kind of has been under my radar. But I did the ride at Disneyland finally. So at

823
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:54,220
least there's that. So I understand that part. But I'm curious about the game. I have to say,

824
01:18:54,220 --> 01:19:00,540
I want to check it out. It sounds kind of up my alley. So we'll see. It's just it's $60. And I'm

825
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:05,660
like, oh, $60. And there's a Final Fantasy 14 expansion out in two weeks. It's going to take

826
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,460
all my time. I already paid for mine. By the way, I forgot to mention during my gaming week,

827
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:17,020
but I need to say every job, every class, max level and Final Fantasy 14 as of Wednesday or

828
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:25,020
Thursday night, I did it. We did it. We did it. So now I'm out of things to do in that game. No,

829
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:30,300
I'm I'm working on some of the mounts I still don't have. There's a lot of like grindy sorts

830
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:35,020
of things like Ishgard crafting. I'm missing one of the mounts and tanking a bunch of dungeons and

831
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,420
so on. So there is still that. Oh, yeah, that's true. Bobby Black Wolf reminds me I never did

832
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:44,540
finish Yakuza. Oh, yeah, that is a thing. That is a thing I should finish. And then there's going

833
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:49,980
to be more inspiration for games I should finish as we get into the next few weeks and award

834
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:55,980
season. Right, Logie? Exactly. So we have the game awards coming December 9, which is about the same

835
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:01,340
time that they have it every year. This year, they're saying that they're gonna show off 40

836
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:06,780
new games or 40 games, at least I don't know if they're all brand new. And one of the promises

837
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:13,820
because it's been brought up recently, different stories about it, but no game supporting or

838
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:20,940
selling NFTs will be featured in the presentation. Because there's been a lot of drama about

839
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:26,620
different companies supporting NFTs. And we have some more on that coming up.

840
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:33,660
Yeah, I was gonna say one of those being EA, which I trust them fully with NFTs,

841
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:39,900
there's no way they're gonna exploit that. So yeah, it's good to see that they're taking that

842
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,900
stance. Honestly, though, that's a really small list of games to exclude from it. But

843
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:50,220
cool. I'm excited. Are we gonna see another No Man's Sky trailer? That's what I really want to know.

844
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:57,820
Hope actually, yes, I would be super into it would be about the because the expedition that I'm I was

845
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:02,620
really trying to beat the current expedition. But I'm on like I have to get the fucking whispering

846
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:06,540
eggs. I have to get like 16 of them. And it's such a pain in the ass. And I don't I think I'm

847
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:10,780
not going to finish because I'm almost out of time. The time is up in like a week. So it is

848
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:16,140
very possible they could launch another expedition and a patch around game awards. You know,

849
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:19,340
sometimes they give it a few weeks between them. They don't do them back to back. So

850
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:24,700
they should sell some DLC, which is honest, is honestly like that with all the content

851
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:29,820
that they put in for free already. It's like, I would buy DLC in a heartbeat. I've put more

852
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,460
hours into that game than I think many of you realize. So I have not put enough hours in my

853
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:43,260
game. Let's see. As soon as Matt says can't imagine Forza Horizon five will be nominated

854
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,700
for this year's game awards. I hope you meant to say won't be nominated. I just it's got to be

855
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:55,020
there. And then as to Matt says waiting for it to run the table and get game awards 2022. And Bobby

856
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,860
Blackwell is pointing out that the game awards is on a Thursday night at eight o'clock Eastern. I

857
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:05,580
mentioned that in case we want to co stream. Okay, so Loki, you might remember when we brought this

858
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,180
up a couple weeks ago, I said, Hey, you and I should go down to LA. What do you think?

859
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,780
I don't know if you're still keen on that idea or what. But here's the thing.

860
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:18,940
I talked to Alan. And I said, because something about this came up. And I said, Alan,

861
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:23,660
the game awards are LA. I said, What would you think about going down there? Like we drive down

862
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:27,500
Thursday, go to the game awards, and then like just kind of fuck around in LA the rest of the

863
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:32,140
weekend. And he said, Yeah, that'd be fun. I'd be curious what the game awards like in person.

864
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:42,860
Let's go. So I need to, I need to figure out how to get tickets. I think they just sell them.

865
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:50,620
But there's a chance I'm going to go. I'm not going to confirm it until I can get that because

866
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,660
I have to make sure my day job commitments are taken care of because we are talking about two

867
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:59,020
days off of work. And I already missed a day this week because of the booster shot and all that

868
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:03,660
stuff. So which is, you know, if you're eligible and meet the criteria, you should consider it,

869
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:12,140
but it just it made me sick. So just plan on it. I think we might go. And that's what I really want

870
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:21,820
to do. Oh, no. Oh, Bobby says they're not selling public tickets this year. You got to be kidding

871
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:27,260
me. No, there went that idea. All right, well, we're still going to try to figure it out.

872
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:32,860
I still want to see if we can go. Of course, the one year I'm able to go, they decide they're not

873
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:37,420
going to sell tickets. Man might be, you know, I'm willing to kind of a break. It might because

874
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:41,420
of covid and all that stuff. They have to, you know, trust that probably they might be doing

875
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:48,220
vaccine checks. I'm triple vaxxed. OK, let's do this. I'll wear a mask indoors. I don't care.

876
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:55,340
All right. Anyway. All right, well, let let I I'm putting that out into the universe.

877
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:02,220
I'd like to go. My husband is supportive of this effort. Let's do it. I want to go. All right.

878
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:08,620
Anyhow, moving on, let's get to our next story. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Is there anything else you

879
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:13,100
want to say about game awards? No, that's it. It's just basically the announcement of that.

880
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:18,860
It's coming. So I'm looking forward to it. I always it's a good presentation every year.

881
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:27,180
All right. Let's talk about this. I'm going to bring up this story, which is a huge rumor.

882
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:34,860
I've been tagged in it a lot because I talk about this game a lot on our. So I get it.

883
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:41,020
It's the rumor going around about one versus one hundred potentially coming back to the Xbox.

884
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:46,380
Of course, we all know this was a big game show. It was so cool because it was actually live. It

885
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:51,340
was originally a game show on NBC and right around it was hosted by Bob Saget. Right. Which was kind

886
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:57,980
of a funny thing, wasn't it? Wasn't it Bob Saget that hosted it? I don't know if it was. Somebody

887
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:03,580
tell me if I'm wrong on that. And anyway, so they did a version on Xbox Live at the same time. It's

888
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:07,260
basically trivia questions and it's one person answering the questions and they're going up

889
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:13,260
against one hundred people. They slowly get eliminated as they get things wrong and all

890
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,180
that stuff. And then you can win Microsoft points. There's an actual host and all this stuff.

891
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:25,500
So here's the thing. Now, this is coming from a podcast journalist type of thing. But this is

892
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,500
somebody who's been in the industry a while and a lot of people know this name, Jeff Grubb from

893
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:34,460
Giant Bomb. I think a lot of you listen to that show. And this is where this was talked about

894
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:41,340
because Altspace VR is part of like the Microsoft mixed reality and like their relaunch of teams

895
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,900
and all this stuff. They're looking at doing something in relation to that with one versus

896
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:51,340
one hundred. So according to him, one versus one hundred is coming back. They are definitely making

897
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:55,900
that game. And it seems like it's coming from the Altspace VR team. They're spearheading the

898
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,060
project and all of the avatars we saw in the Microsoft team things last week. They're going

899
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:08,060
to use those avatars and bring that stuff in. So now, of course, it's a rumor. It's a journalist

900
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:13,660
saying this on podcast. But here's here's the thing. He's putting a lot of like that. Those

901
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:20,540
words say a lot. They are definitely making that game. He's wagering a lot by saying that. So he

902
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:24,940
has some type of knowledge that something's going on. Here's the thing that could happen.

903
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:31,020
Will the game release or will it get canceled or they'll decide to shelve it for whatever other

904
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:36,140
reason? That could still happen. One hundred percent. One versus one hundred percent.

905
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:44,300
But we'll just hope that, you know, we'll hope it works out, you know, but there could be a lot of

906
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:50,620
challenges with the networking and all that stuff and so forth. So we'll see what comes of it.

907
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:55,340
But certainly my hopes are very high. I wonder if that also means that, like,

908
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:01,420
oh, it's going to be built into like a PC version. It doesn't like nothing about what he's saying

909
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:10,060
means Xbox Series X, although I think Microsoft would be fools to not have it there. So but we we

910
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:17,020
are jumping a little bit to conclusions. If you want to revive the tea leaves further or I'm

911
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,900
sorry, you want to read the tea leaves further. Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox,

912
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:28,300
has dropped hints before. This was during an official Fan Fest live stream October 2020.

913
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,500
It was going to be going against a website quiz and the trivia game did not take place.

914
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:38,540
Phil Spencer said, I just want to say when our teams are trying to do new things that we've

915
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:43,260
never done before, I want to be 100 percent behind those things. Sometimes they'll turn

916
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:47,420
out amazing. Sometimes they'll be good learning experiences for us. But for all the fans who've

917
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:52,780
been with us with this on us, we're going to make it good with you guys. We don't know exactly what

918
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:57,900
it is yet. So thanks for hanging with us during this and our little experiment. We'll learn.

919
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:03,660
Maybe we should even be building our own trivia game, like from our past, that allows people to

920
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:11,340
play a trivia game more often. Maybe that could happen. So this isn't the first time he's hinted.

921
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:17,260
He also said in 2019 specifically that one versus 100 is something that they would like to bring

922
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:25,180
back. As far as I'm concerned, all the stars are aligned. And this is in development. It's just

923
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:29,900
a matter of, like I said before, just because it's in development doesn't mean it gets released.

924
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:36,780
A lot happens between now and then. As we've seen. Bobby Blackwell in chat says,

925
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:40,700
this isn't the same as Microsoft promising you something. Microsoft isn't messing with you.

926
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:46,540
I'm going to, I'm going to actually, because you tagged me with this on Twitter and 140 characters,

927
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:50,940
280, whatever, isn't enough to really explain this. So I sassed you back with a GIF.

928
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:59,020
This is why I tagged Microsoft in the tweet. Yes, they are playing with my emotions every day since

929
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:04,540
they canceled it. They could bring that game back anytime they want to, assuming they can get the

930
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:11,180
licensing deals and all that stuff. But the concept of a large live game show, even if it's

931
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:16,780
not one versus 100 itself, and I've said this on the show before, I would like to see come back a

932
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:22,780
live show of sorts. So Microsoft continuing to not do that is what's playing with my emotions.

933
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:27,420
And yeah, I tagged him in the tweet because I wanted to show support. This shit needs to happen.

934
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,900
I'm sure no one cares. No one's going to read it. No one's going to see.

935
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:35,020
But I have a feeling a lot of people are tagging Microsoft right now in that,

936
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:47,340
what's going on. So, all right. Anyway, let's move on and talk about other Xbox stuff,

937
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:53,660
which I think is Dark Sakura? Yep. So some of the older 360 games

938
01:29:53,980 --> 01:30:00,380
with many Bethesda titles are going to be updated for the Xbox 20th anniversary live stream.

939
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:07,180
Among those games are Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Fable

940
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:14,540
Anniversary, Dead Space, Dead Space 3, Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Fable 3. They've all

941
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:21,020
got updates. We're just not sure what they are. And it's going to be a pretty big event.

942
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:30,380
Supposed to happen on, well, tomorrow for us, November 15th, 2021, exactly 20 years

943
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:39,740
after the launch of the Xbox starting at 10 AM Pacific time, 5 PM GMT. And there are also

944
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:45,740
some rumors about them doing an early release for Halo Infinite's free to play multiplayer.

945
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:53,900
And then a few other surprises that they have, of course, it's not a surprise if we tell you

946
01:30:53,900 --> 01:31:01,660
kind of things. But apparently it does look like there has been some kind of update for

947
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:08,860
Halo Infinite store page that says the game will be released on December 8th. There you go.

948
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:14,700
All right. I'd be very curious about the classic. What else can they do for the backwards compatible

949
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:20,620
titles? Unless they went back and did some remasters. Because some of them, like Final

950
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:28,700
Fantasy 13, I've been playing on Xbox thanks to Game Pass. And it looks a lot better. The movies

951
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:33,180
obviously are that better quality and so on. The game just looks a lot better than it did when I

952
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:38,780
first played it. And so I'm curious what other stuff they might be doing to old classic games.

953
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:44,060
I'd also, you all know I'd still love to see the old DDRs be backwards compatible, but I'm sure

954
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:49,900
they're going to say music licensing is what's stopping that, even though I just want to put

955
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:54,940
my disk into this drive and have it reboot. It's whatever. Fine. Whatever. I guess because

956
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:59,260
technically you kind of have to download some of these things. It probably gets into messy legal

957
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:03,020
territory. But I'd be curious to see what else they might bring up with the classic updates.

958
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:09,980
So we'll see. All right. So back to a topic we were talking about a little bit earlier. Right,

959
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:19,900
Loki? You're muted, Loki. Sorry, kids were being loud in the background. So going back to

960
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:26,540
NFTs, as I mentioned, EA was one of the companies that was talking about getting into the NFT space.

961
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,540
Well, apparently Square Enix is another company that's looking to get into that

962
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:35,900
space as well, saying that NFTs have high affinity with our assets. Proof of concept

963
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:41,580
phase is over. This means is that they're going to transition to full commercial or

964
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:46,300
full commercialization stage. So they're going to try to sell it to make some money.

965
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:53,420
I don't know, most of the entities I see out there, like most of the news stories and headlines

966
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:57,580
you see, they're just talking about the scams and all the rug pulls that are out there. I just don't

967
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:02,940
know if this is really necessary unless we're talking about like we're going to allow you to

968
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:12,140
resell our digital games or something like that. With all this talk and NFT being a buzzword and

969
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:17,820
the whole investors are going to jump on anything that has the word NFT and all this, I still have

970
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:24,300
yet to understand what is the fucking point? Why would a video game use an NFT? Can somebody

971
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:30,140
explain that to me like I'm five? I understand the concept of the whole you own this thing,

972
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:35,820
like a digital receipt. Why does, why would that work in a video game? How is that different from

973
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:41,900
DLC? You bought a thing that says you own this digitally. Well, here's the thing too.

974
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:46,060
What does the NFT do to that? Kind of funny because, you know, if you look at all the,

975
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:49,900
you know, end user license agreements out there where basically anything that you do purchase

976
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,300
nowadays, you don't really own, you just own a license to it. And now they're like, oh, but wait,

977
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,420
wait, hold on. Now we want you to actually own something. It's like, well,

978
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:03,020
why can't I just own the digital game that you sold me in the first place? You know,

979
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:10,140
it's, it's really dumb, but I don't really see a point to it aside from it's a buzzword,

980
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:15,900
you know, that people are kind of looking for anything about and it just gets exposure.

981
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,820
And people have found ways to make money off of things that really shouldn't be probably worth

982
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:26,780
that much. Like, you know, JPEGs of small little pieces of artwork, like was it Taco Bell made

983
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:31,900
some stuff and they were selling NFTs and it sold for quite a bit of money, a lot more, I'm sure

984
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:36,460
than it was actually put into it. I just think they see money. A lot of these companies are really

985
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:45,500
centered on the money. And unfortunately, Square Enix had some issues with certain games that they

986
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:50,220
put out. Like, was it the Marvel Avengers game where, you know, they basically build the game

987
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:55,900
around monetization through, you know, XP boosts and stuff like that, even though they claim, oh,

988
01:34:55,900 --> 01:35:01,180
we're going to walk it back and stuff like that. I don't know. It's just these shady practices

989
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:06,300
that they see opportunities for revenue. And that's really the only driving matter here.

990
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,940
I don't think they're going to use them in any sort of meaningful way.

991
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:13,980
Okay. Looking at chat, some people trying to help break it down for me because I am with SSJ 100,

992
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:19,260
Matt, trying to understand NFTs makes my brain feel like I'm 80. I just want to be left alone

993
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:24,860
in my chair so I can nap and watch Judge Wapner. Yes. Very that. That is exactly where I'm coming

994
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:30,380
from. All right. So comments, Bobby Blackwell says, because you could resell it outside of

995
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:35,100
the games company's involvement. That's why they want the NFT. Quest Buster says,

996
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:39,420
so as a devil's advocate, when a rare weapon drops from a mob in an MMO,

997
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:43,820
it can be distinctly tied to you with an NFT, giving it an additional level of value.

998
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:49,980
Okay. What I'm not understanding. I could today, if a rare weapon drops for me in a game,

999
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:55,820
if I really want to, I could go onto a forum and say, Hey, PayPal me five bucks. I'll trade you

1000
01:35:55,820 --> 01:36:00,860
this weapon in game. I can do that with this. This is outside of that though. So this is like,

1001
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:05,180
I can literally, you know, hand you the keys to this weapon and then you can do that.

1002
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:09,660
It does have like, if you want to monetize something in that way, it does have like,

1003
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:13,820
that's not different. That's not what do you, that's not what I understand. I understand what

1004
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:17,980
you're saying, but this actually, I think puts gaming companies in worse situations because

1005
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:24,540
they've, you know, they've run a foul of different gambling laws by having loot boxes and stuff,

1006
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,860
but then they've made the argument that are, well, you can't make any money outside of these games.

1007
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:34,860
Like, you know, those FIFA, the FIFA money that you have or whatever, you can't turn that into

1008
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:40,700
real money. Well, now that you now with this, you can, you could turn something into real money.

1009
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:45,980
And so now they're going to run a foul of those laws again. Like I just, it's not a good idea,

1010
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:51,260
but whatever they're going to do it. Bobby explaining to my people's court,

1011
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:56,540
loving ass San NFTs use the blockchain. So you are anonymous. That's the difference.

1012
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:01,820
PayPal is trackable. Crypto is not crypto is free from the influence of big banks.

1013
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:07,740
PayPal is not, you know, if you don't want something, if you don't want a monetary

1014
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:14,060
transaction to be tracked, that sounds shady to me. Why are video game companies wanting to get

1015
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:24,300
into shady things or any company, any Taco Bell or anybody like, I don't know. I mean,

1016
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:29,420
I guess my brain just can't understand this because I'm like, somebody, somebody,

1017
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,180
somebody somewhere had to have built the blockchain, right? Like somebody, somebody,

1018
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:37,420
like I know you say it's, it's all these computers together. Well, with NFT accounts, you can

1019
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:41,980
actually, a lot of times you can follow, like, cause they'll have these profiles where they

1020
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:47,180
display their NFTs and you can track it back. You know, that's why there is a blockchain. So

1021
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:51,660
you can see who it is, but sometimes it may be, you know, may not know who actually owns

1022
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:57,260
that account. It's just that, you know, there's an account that has this purchase or that made

1023
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:03,180
that purchase. So the whole reason these video game companies want to do this is so that people

1024
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:10,140
can do transactions untracked is what I'm kind of, well, and the fact, and I also understand

1025
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:14,620
it is a buzzword right now. They're, they're using this word because it makes everybody's

1026
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:20,060
ears perk up. When in fact, it sounds like there's a lot of us out there that are like,

1027
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:26,220
stop glamorizing this. Your ears should not be perking up. You should be looking the other way

1028
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:29,820
when you hear this. That's a lot of people that are saying this.

1029
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:34,540
It's like, how about they focus on actually finishing a game properly instead of,

1030
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:43,900
you know, getting NFTs involved? Questbuster says blockchain cash is a real thing too.

1031
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:47,900
Governments are looking into digitizing their currency using the same technology. China is

1032
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:53,020
already piloting a program for their own crypto. EU is looking at it and the Fed is also interested

1033
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:57,180
to see what it can do. Wow. And Jason simply breaks it down. The whole reason people sell

1034
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:01,900
is for money. Yeah. Everything else, anonymity, regulation, et cetera, is only incidentally extra.

1035
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:09,420
The reason is thing has value to be extracted. Well, can't we, as people stand up and say,

1036
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:16,300
NFT has no value. You can't, aren't we able to do that? You can. And that happens sometimes,

1037
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:21,580
like people will buy into like some stupid thing because they think it's going to be worth a lot.

1038
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:25,660
And then people, then they find out, Oh, I guess no one really wants to buy that. And then it's

1039
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:30,860
worth nothing. It's all speculative. It's whatever you value, assign it. But people are

1040
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:38,140
they're so hyped with this, like, what's the next big thing going to be? You know, it was Bitcoin

1041
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:42,620
and Dogecoin and they're like, what's it going to be? And so everybody's getting like way too hyped

1042
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:46,700
about every single new thing that's coming out. And that's the thing is they throw a lot of money

1043
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,540
into it, hoping that's going to go up in value. And maybe it does, but a lot of the times it's

1044
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:56,940
normally a person that creates the NFT or puts together the cryptocurrency and then they make

1045
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:02,700
all the money and then leave with all the money. And then you're sitting there with something

1046
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:06,940
useless. Why did they do that instead of just giving me all the money? That'd be easy.

1047
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,740
Because they want all the money. No, I want it. It's mine.

1048
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:19,340
They're not going to give it to you. Continuing on with the NFT stuff that I still don't understand.

1049
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:26,620
The CEO of Discord had to backtrack a little bit. It looks like a screenshot kind of got out there.

1050
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:30,380
Actually, I think he actually tweeted it out. It wasn't like a leaked or anything. He actually

1051
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:41,260
tweeted it. Jason Citron, who is the founder and lead of Discord, tweeted a mock up on earlier this

1052
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:47,340
week of a Discord interface showing crypto products like MetaMask, Wallet Connect and

1053
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:52,940
Ethereum integrated within the Discord app. Also integrated with like YouTube, Twitch and all that

1054
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:58,780
stuff. Needless to say, Discord fans threw a shit fit, I think is the technical term for it,

1055
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:06,700
and it was quickly retracted, basically. So yeah, I love this. Probably nothing with a tweet,

1056
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:13,740
a screenshot of that whole mock up. Although to be fair, maybe that's all it was. It was a mock up.

1057
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:18,940
It was something to, you know, what if we wanted to get into this? What if we wanted to manage this

1058
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:24,140
stuff? What might that look like? It may have been simply a how about this sort of thing.

1059
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:30,300
But then boy, oh boy, boy, oh boy, that didn't do well. Oh, and I think there was an there was like

1060
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:34,780
a survey that Discord put out that had NFT in it as well. So people connected the two together.

1061
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:41,500
Anyway, in a follow up tweet, Citron said, thanks for all the perspectives. We have no current plans

1062
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:47,260
to ship this internal concept. For now, we focused on protecting users from spam, scans and fraud.

1063
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:52,140
Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale more soon.

1064
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:58,540
In a statement in an interview with TechCrunch, he continued, we appreciate all the perspectives

1065
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:02,220
we've been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet and want

1066
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:07,340
to clarify from you. We have no plans to ship it at this time. We're excited about the potential

1067
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:11,980
for Web3 technology and the positive way these communities are coming together on Discord,

1068
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:17,100
especially those organized around environmentally friendly creator focused projects. However,

1069
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:21,020
we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now, we're focused

1070
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:28,780
on protecting users from spams, scans and fraud. So did it look to you again? I don't understand.

1071
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:35,500
Did it look to you like Discord wanted to be like a central hub, a key ring, a place to store these

1072
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,460
NFTs, a place to store like a wallet for your Ethereum and all this stuff? Is that what Discord

1073
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:44,060
was kind of looking to be? Was kind of like what I guess PayPal does for some of that stuff?

1074
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:48,460
Maybe, but that's not a really good point. I don't know if I'd trust them necessarily with

1075
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:58,380
all that. Okay. Y'all just told me the whole point was to decentralize and have all this stuff off

1076
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:03,740
the record. So why would I give it to Discord? Exactly. It links it to yourself. But then on top

1077
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:11,260
of that, you know, they've had issues with people putting malware into like and sending out messages

1078
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:15,980
to people and saying, hey, come test my game and stuff like that and exploiting their accounts.

1079
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:19,180
And basically they're able to delete their accounts or have access to it. So yeah,

1080
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:24,780
that's where I want all my crypto to be is in an easily exploitable account. Awesome.

1081
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:35,420
NFTs will not have value until sex workers start accepting them. That is when you know something

1082
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:40,940
has actual value is when the world's oldest profession will start accepting it. So until

1083
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:48,380
that time, if a sex worker doesn't accept NFT in trade, they're not, they're not, they don't have

1084
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:52,780
the value you think it does. That's like saying though, like, hey, I've got this fine painting

1085
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:59,420
here. What can I get for that? I mean, like just because they don't accept it doesn't mean it's

1086
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,500
not, doesn't have value. Now that said though, a lot of these don't have value. You'd be surprised

1087
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,700
who you can take to a pawn shop. Can you take an NFT to a pawn shop? You can, you can take it,

1088
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:13,500
you can take it and sell it and then you get a theorem and then you can use that to pay for

1089
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:22,540
stuff. But, but yeah, it's typically people don't go, Hey, I got, I've got this JPEG of a weird

1090
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:30,860
monkey. What can I get for that? Bobby says, I honestly think discord was just wanting to accept

1091
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:36,460
crypto and there's, I can probably see that they wanted to link the wallet in the same way they

1092
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:39,980
linked to your credit card for your nitro payments or the same way they linked to your

1093
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:46,060
PayPal. Interesting. Zen monkey does point out, point out Pornhub does accept Bitcoin for

1094
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:52,700
membership now. Well, that's fabulous. I definitely need to take a trip back to the olden days because

1095
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:58,380
that is where I'm clearly living. So let us go to our next segment and cleanse the palette with this

1096
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:15,100
little bumper here. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the

1097
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:21,260
vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

1098
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:26,140
I think a lot of you are going to love tonight's pick. What'd you pick tonight, DarkSakura?

1099
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:32,140
I picked Mega Man Battle Network, also known as Rockman.exe.

1100
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:41,100
It was developed in Capcom for the Game Boy Advance. It is the first title of the Rockman.exe

1101
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:49,820
or Mega Man Battle Network games. It was released in Japan as a launch game on March 21st, 2021,

1102
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:54,460
and then released later in the year in North America and Europe. It also is on the Wii U

1103
01:45:54,460 --> 01:46:02,620
Virtual Console. And it's a game I personally didn't get too much into, but a lot of people

1104
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:11,500
love it. And so I figured I would talk about it. So it takes place during the 21st century,

1105
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:18,300
which we're in. And everyone, basically everyone just lives on the internet.

1106
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:29,820
You have these avatars called Netnavi, and you play a kid named Lan Hikari. I guess that's what

1107
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:40,220
his name is. And his Netnavi, Mega Man.exe or Rockman.exe. And so he's got to solve crimes done

1108
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:47,820
by the World 3 organization, WWW. So it is a little bit of a tactical role play game

1109
01:46:47,820 --> 01:47:00,140
where you control Lan or the avatar. And you have some battles that go in real time. You have

1110
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:05,820
special abilities called battle chips that you fight off different viruses in the cyberspace.

1111
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:13,500
And it also has like the battle chips or something like these folders, like card decks

1112
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:20,620
that you can use for kind of like simulating a collectible card game, something like that.

1113
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:28,620
But anyway, a lot of people are really, really into it. You can also do some other stuff in the

1114
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:33,900
game, like some RPG-ish stuff. Like, you know, you hang out with NPCs, you can check your email,

1115
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:43,900
buy stuff, do netmissions, speak to your little avatar there. You can also power up your little

1116
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:50,700
avatar guy as he goes along. I mean, when he's out of health, game over, right? The thing about

1117
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:56,700
this game is it was actually conceptualized as being a horror game. It was developed by Capcom

1118
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:08,140
Production Studio 2 around the success of Pokemon. And then rather than it being a standard

1119
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:14,140
action game, like they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, they wanted to do something like

1120
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:21,820
what was happening in the Pokemon game to have this adventure with it, to add a real-world

1121
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:28,460
element to Mega Man, to have a way for the player to connect with another player that's connecting

1122
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:39,100
with the character. And then they also marketed it along with an anime adaptation so that, I mean,

1123
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:46,060
it's all about money. In the end, you know, it's buy our game, watch our show, we're going to do

1124
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:57,100
all this other stuff by that too. So when it was first announced in August of 2000, there was

1125
01:48:57,100 --> 01:49:04,380
a demo of the game that was promoted at Nintendo Space World. It was only available on two of the

1126
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:14,220
140 playable consoles. They showed it off at Tokyo Game Show the next month. And the beta of it

1127
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:22,460
had you fight a Woodman.exe. And so it had some different stuff going on with it. But the game

1128
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:29,580
was fairly well received. It got an 80% on game rankings, 79 out of 100 on Metacritic.

1129
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:39,500
Famitsu gave it a 30 of 40, which is good for Famitsu. And they said that it was really an

1130
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:47,500
original kind of game playing off of the Mega Man franchise. So there you go, Battle Network

1131
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:55,260
Rockman.exe, aka Mega Man Battle Network. All right, there's your classic giveaway. You know,

1132
01:49:55,260 --> 01:50:01,340
I have to admit, I never really got into or really played this series, but I know a lot of people

1133
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:07,740
really, really love it. So it's one of those kind of gems that I guess I just unfortunately

1134
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:12,140
passed over and never got around to, but would love to someday, especially. And I see in chat,

1135
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:18,140
DJ Rama S is like, oh yes, I want a reboot of this. And yeah, I think that would be a good way

1136
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:22,780
for a lot of people who maybe missed it the first time to get back on board. I guess you never know,

1137
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:30,060
right? Yeah, you never can tell. Rama also says the anime is so good. And I trust Rama's

1138
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:37,180
opinion on the anime with his own program here. For me, I just still prefer the classic

1139
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:42,940
Rockman stuff, you know? But I know a lot of people who are into it and I would be remiss

1140
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:50,780
if I didn't bring it up and it did come out 10 years ago. Yep. And as much as I would say that

1141
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:57,340
too, like it's all about the main lines for me, I did love Legends. You know, I was always sad they

1142
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:02,700
never did a third one, you know, but that's what it is. Quest Buster brings up something we were

1143
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:07,500
talking about in a prior week. Like Sega, it was great seeing Capcom breakout creative

1144
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:14,380
bursts like this that no one expected. So, all right. Never say never about Legends.

1145
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:19,820
They get desperate enough for content they'll make. Never say never. That's true. All right.

1146
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:23,980
Let's travel around the gaming world and check out some other quick headlines starting with Loki.

1147
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:30,780
Yeah. So, this is a game that I keep, I kept trying to remember the name of like,

1148
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:37,180
I've talked about this before. This was on the Brave Venture Musashi demo disc, I believe. And.

1149
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:45,500
Back in the day. Yeah. Way back in the day. So, it is a game called Racing Lagoon and it came out

1150
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:53,660
on the original PlayStation back in 1999. And it's now getting a, it's now playable in English,

1151
01:51:53,660 --> 01:52:00,140
thanks to fan translations. So, it's pretty cool. It's like a racing RPG, kind of like a

1152
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:05,740
drift racing RPG type thing. So. I vaguely remember hearing about something like this.

1153
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:10,700
I think they just had, I don't remember if they had like a playable, like actual demo for it,

1154
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:17,020
but it was, I think it may have been just a trailer, but I've ever seen that. I was like,

1155
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:20,620
oh man, that looks cool. And then it just like never came out in the United States. So.

1156
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:29,500
Oh, well. Neat. And then, yeah. New DDR. It's pretty exciting. So, DDR Grand Prix. This was,

1157
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:37,980
the PC game that we kind of did the test for not that long ago. And it's got a bunch of new songs,

1158
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:44,220
plus a bunch of older songs as well. It's going to require a subscription service to play it online.

1159
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:47,740
And I think they're going to also have a controller as well, but you can play with

1160
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:56,220
basically any USB controller that is offered out there. I fully anticipate playing this on my

1161
01:52:56,220 --> 01:53:02,140
cabinet as soon as the songs get leaked and then put on to StepMania, which will probably happen

1162
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:08,220
very quickly. Clever. Especially with all the assets being able to be ripped from a PC game.

1163
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:12,860
I mean, it's like, that'll be just a matter of time. It's also funny to kind of just sit back

1164
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:16,700
and reflect on how far we've come. You know, in the early days of Orange Launch Radio,

1165
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:22,620
we were talking about the literal Dance Dance Revolution PC game release with its infamous

1166
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:28,780
downloadable characters. Mr. Spanky. That's where that whole character came from. Yes,

1167
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:33,500
they literally released a character called Mr. Spanky, who just looked like, you know,

1168
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:40,220
they were dressed up in bondage here. Somebody else. It was like two bondage, you know,

1169
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:45,740
kings and queens that were released together in this whole thing. And now here we are talking

1170
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:51,100
about DDR PC again, but it's a subscription service. It's just, it's interesting. Not that

1171
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:56,540
I'm not going to get it, but, um, yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to see it, check it out.

1172
01:53:56,540 --> 01:54:01,100
It's just, I feel like I haven't really touched DDR in a while. I'm still waiting for that round

1173
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:07,100
one to open up out here, but you know, the movie theater. Yeah. Yeah. I was just going to say,

1174
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:14,540
uh, Alan, funny to out of the blue today, I saw our pal JD, um, was in town cause it turned out

1175
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:19,100
the only place he could get a booster shot was up here. Long story. Oh, I missed him.

1176
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:24,460
He was literally like, we took him to the thing and back to the train basically. So,

1177
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:31,100
uh, for like two seconds. Yeah. Um, so, um, Oh, what was I gonna say with all that though? Um,

1178
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:37,020
Oh, we got, we brought up the topic of round one cause it came up in the car

1179
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:42,540
and Alan looked into it and was like, well, that movie theater opened up on Thursday and I was

1180
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:48,300
like, Oh shit. Okay. So the movie theater malls open now and the round one stuff is now on the

1181
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:53,340
city of Roseville's website. It just, they published a story on like Tuesday, the whole

1182
01:54:53,340 --> 01:55:00,140
thing, like round one coming soon. So I, I wonder, I wonder if they're going to try to

1183
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:03,900
get it open by black Friday when there's going to be all that traffic through the mall. I would be

1184
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:09,180
22 on there now. So we were just there last weekend.

1185
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:17,420
You know, and I was, I think it'd be a while. I was thinking that probably those machines

1186
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:22,780
are, but if they, if they hadn't already purchased them and had them in storage over here

1187
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:28,300
before the pandemic, those machines are probably on a ship somewhere in the middle of the ocean

1188
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:36,780
right now. And that's probably what's holding it back, but we'll see. Let's see. Um, Oh, that's

1189
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:42,060
neat. Uh, did your MS says the first opening theme to the anime jam session podcast was from

1190
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:48,780
the rock man, exe, mega man, battle network anime. That's really cool. Um, yeah. All right. Um,

1191
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:54,780
dark to see you said they deleted holic. You can never delete holic. Absolutely not. Uh,

1192
01:55:54,780 --> 01:56:00,060
dark to see me. I played the free version of grand Prix. I'm sorely tempted to subscribe

1193
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:04,540
since you get a good chunk of songs, including a 20 plus stuff. Orange ride also played this

1194
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:08,620
week. Didn't subscribe, but they allowed you to play it with tickets. Yes. Pay for play,

1195
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:15,660
bringing the arcade experience home, uh, being able to pay just a dollar. So neato. All right.

1196
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:20,140
Yeah. All right. Uh, dark soccer, what do you have for rapid fire news?

1197
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:28,940
Um, so if you have a Nintendo switch, you can watch Twitch on switch. It is in the e-shop and

1198
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:35,740
for free, and you can watch your favorite streamers through the Twitch app. So cool.

1199
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:42,780
I still prefer to watch on my, uh, on my computer. Yeah. It's uh, and it's also,

1200
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:48,860
in my opinion, not as good as the X-Box or PlayStation experience because you can't have

1201
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:56,780
chat and the video up at the same time, unless you're using a mobile phone to like have chat,

1202
01:56:56,780 --> 01:57:01,740
which the app actually encourages you to do. For whatever reason, it can't run those by

1203
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:06,220
side by side. Bobby had an interesting ridiculous. Bobby had a thing on his show tonight where he's

1204
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:12,540
like, it's tapping into the video feed directly. And just displaying that, like almost like you're

1205
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:16,940
watching a YouTube or something. So I don't know. It's, it's very clearly some weird technical

1206
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:24,140
limitation of the switch. Um, so, but I will say, so I list all these negatives, but the switch has

1207
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:29,500
a very nice screen. I would rather watch on my switch screen than I would my mobile phone.

1208
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:35,020
Cause it's a little bit bigger and it's very nice looking. Um, so there, there is that just be

1209
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:41,340
prepared. You can't really see chat, uh, unless the streamer is projecting chat on top of their

1210
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:48,540
image, which some do some don't. So yeah. Anyway, it's like, Oh, use the phone and this app. I mean,

1211
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:54,780
I guess if you're doing it on TV or something, that's fine, but. Which is kind of what I do.

1212
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,540
It's it's too slow to type on X-Box. Yeah. But if it's on the handheld,

1213
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:01,420
like if I'm watching a handheld, it's like, well, I'm just watching my phone.

1214
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:06,380
Yeah. I'm with, with Mike Daft and Pod Culture who are both echoing that the OLED probably makes

1215
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:10,780
a great case. I don't even have an OLED and I think it looks good on the switch screen. So

1216
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:19,500
there is that anyway, what else do you have? Um, so the publisher for, uh, call of duty, um,

1217
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:30,300
had to put out a change to it because, um, there were torn pages of the Quran, uh, scattered

1218
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:34,860
in the game. Some of them, uh, scattered on the ground and with blood on them,

1219
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:42,140
which of course angered many Muslims, uh, because it is a sacred text and to them the literal word

1220
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:50,300
of God. And they call it Islamophobic. So, um, they actually posted, uh, uh, the, from the, uh,

1221
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:57,020
call of duty, Middle East, uh, account in Arabic stating that they removed the scenes from the game

1222
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:02,940
apologizing for the offense caused. And of course, this is a game that came out November 5th.

1223
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:08,780
I'll read the translation. The game call of duty was designed for all users, the scenes in the game,

1224
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:13,820
which were offensive to Muslims were, uh, which were shown last week have now been removed.

1225
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:18,300
They should not have been included in the game. We apologize profusely. We're taking all measures to

1226
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:22,060
address this issue within the company in order to understand what happened and ensure it does

1227
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:28,300
not happen again. It's like our sex abuse scandals. Uh, as Joe and Matt says, come on,

1228
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:32,060
someone missed some common sense there. Yeah. It seems to be a thing that's missing in gaming

1229
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:41,420
lately. All right. Um, I, I think they've already done their damage, so yep. All righty.

1230
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:45,740
Let's travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases. I know we're in the height of

1231
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:51,660
November and I think we got some big stuff this week, right? Logie. Yeah, we got, we got stuff.

1232
01:59:51,660 --> 02:00:00,540
That's for sure. Um, so starting things off, uh, we've got, looks like grow the song of ever tree

1233
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:06,620
on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, hex tech mayhem, a league in the

1234
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:13,500
league of legends story on PC and Nintendo switch. That's a rhythm game and Sherlock

1235
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:19,980
Holmes chapter one on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series X surviving the aftermath on

1236
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:28,220
Nintendo switch, the waylanders on PC, final fantasy seven, the first soldier on iOS and

1237
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:34,620
Android. Uh, we've got clang two on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

1238
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:43,260
Xbox one and Xbox series X kid amnesia exhibition on PC, Mac and PlayStation five,

1239
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:52,060
Microsoft flight simulator game of the year edition on PC and Xbox series X battlefield

1240
02:00:52,060 --> 02:01:00,380
2042 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X. And of course,

1241
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:08,540
last but not least, uh, we have Pokemon, um, brilliant diamond and Shane Pearl on Nintendo

1242
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:14,860
switch. And I'm just shocked that they put that in one game. It didn't try to sell it as two.

1243
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:17,900
No, it's being sold as two. It's just also in a combo pack.

1244
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:26,940
Oh, nevermind. All right. Uh, traveling to Japan, uh, obviously Pokemon, brilliant diamond and

1245
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:32,060
shining Pearl. Uh, those two games are the big, big release in Japan on the switch this week.

1246
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:35,900
There's not a lot going up against it, but there are a couple of alternative games you can check

1247
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:41,660
out on the 18th. There's a game called the illmatic envelope swamp and Raiders re swag.

1248
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:46,380
That is a game that's coming out on the switch. And then there's another game called knives out

1249
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:51,580
game rhythm pack. And I was like, Oh, is it a rhythm game? It certainly doesn't look like it.

1250
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:56,860
In fact, when I look at the box art, it kind of looks like, like it's squid game type characters.

1251
02:01:56,860 --> 02:02:02,860
And I'm like, how did they do that so fucking fast? But it's a, it's a Sega published title,

1252
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:08,300
which is also interesting. And, uh, it's five players in a group, a hundred players in a battle.

1253
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:12,620
You work with teammates to live to the end, trust your teammates and win together with guns in hand.

1254
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:20,380
So it, it really sounds like, I don't know. It's, it's just interesting that that is so fast,

1255
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:25,740
but okay. Um, let's see also, uh, that, that is all on the switch, but let's not leave out

1256
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:32,540
PlayStation, uh, five PlayStation five has its own release of battlefield 2042 is out in Japan this

1257
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:37,820
week. And, uh, that is it. Yeah. Farming simulator to look forward next week, but that is it for the

1258
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:45,420
PS five. Let's go over to the UK dark soccer. On the 16th, we have surviving the aftermath

1259
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:53,740
for the big three, um, angry alligator for switch on the 18th on the 19th battlefield 2042

1260
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:59,580
for Xbox PlayStation, Pokemon brilliant diamond and shining Pearl double pack for switch,

1261
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:08,540
including their, uh, individual releases as well, uh, Zenith for, uh, the 19th also on switch

1262
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:18,380
and also distrust on switch. Um, we have disco Elysium, the final cut for Xbox and PlayStation

1263
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:25,740
arc ultimate survivor edition for the same two, again, on the 19th train some world to rush hour

1264
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:33,580
deluxe edition on just PlayStation. Uh, we have the eternal cylinder. Uh, we also have

1265
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:39,980
our ultimate survivor edition. Didn't I just say that one? Yeah, they repeated it. Nevermind.

1266
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:45,100
Oh, it looks like it's actually got a lower, um, a lower ranking, a lower age limit on it.

1267
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:51,500
Maybe there's two versions. Oh, that could be. And that that's going to be it for this week.

1268
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:59,500
All right. Uh, actually it reminds me, I've got to, uh, get my copy of, uh, diamond or Pearl

1269
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:03,500
preloaded. I haven't decided which one I want to get. I didn't sit down and look at the differences

1270
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:08,060
and try to remember. Cause I don't remember like which Pokemon are in which version. So, uh,

1271
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:12,700
we'll see. All right. Anyhow, uh, we have a few more stories for you guys and then we'll see if

1272
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:16,460
we have any time. Well, yeah, we should have time for at least one call. If anyone wants to call us

1273
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:21,020
over at, uh, our discord server, uh, which you can continue the conversation throughout the week.

1274
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:27,180
It's not just for our live calls, vog network.com. That's VOG network.com slash discord. If you want

1275
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:32,140
to join and the green room is where you want to be waiting. Uh, if you'd like to call in,

1276
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:36,380
but we do have a few, so it's going to be about 15, 20 minutes because we still have a few stories

1277
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:41,500
to get to first. Uh, Mike deaf says I can get you the list. Yeah. I know it's on self road. I'm just

1278
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:47,180
lazy. Uh, and also the knives out game I mentioned earlier, nothing to do with the movie. Yeah. I

1279
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:51,660
had that same kind of like, is this the movie, but why would that be in Japan first? It's nothing

1280
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:59,260
to do the movie. Okay. Um, Loki, uh, I think this is kind of funny. Yeah. So, Hey, if you have a lot

1281
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:05,420
of money that you want to burn on absolute garbage, um, Gucci is going to start selling

1282
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:15,100
some Xbox series X, um, controllers, I guess for $10,000. Um, or no, I'm sorry, an actual console.

1283
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:23,660
So it's going to be a customized Xbox series X plus two controllers for $10,000. And they come

1284
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:28,620
in map. I guess the controllers are a matte black with like a red and blue stripe on it.

1285
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:34,460
Because if you want to talk about speculative value, there you go. Um,

1286
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:41,900
alternatively, you could also just not do that and buy an Xbox series X normally, and then customize

1287
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:48,860
your own controller through the Xbox design lab, which has now added 19 new colors and

1288
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:53,580
rubberized grips. So you can actually make your own controller and it costs much less than $10,000,

1289
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:59,100
only $70 and 10 more. If you want to actually add those rubberized grip,

1290
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:05,020
I don't understand people that buy this stuff. I guess people that are by this stuff, you know,

1291
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:14,140
$10,000 for them is just pocket change. So why not? Just, just, just drop in the bucket. Those,

1292
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:18,380
those money that are making, uh, all that money scalping PS fives, we'll be able to afford the

1293
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:25,020
Gucci, uh, Xbox. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Uh, and did tiger claw brings up the same thing I thought of

1294
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:29,820
honestly saying that's funny considering there's that house of Gucci that's coming out. Well,

1295
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:35,660
you know, the Gucci company is, is still very much everywhere in your local mall with, uh,

1296
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:41,820
uh, people lined up outside it to get in. Who does Gucci anymore? It's all Hermes.

1297
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:50,540
So I'm just saying they're still, uh, Versace or as I always like to say in my best show girls

1298
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:55,660
versus right. Uh, Versace, same thing. And they had that whole show about, you know,

1299
02:06:55,660 --> 02:07:01,500
the really unfortunate killing of, uh, uh, the, the, the guy has started that whole thing. Um,

1300
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:05,820
and like Ricky Martin was in that and all that, right? The, the, it was the American crime story

1301
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:10,380
or whatever. Is that it? Was that what it, the Versace that was all on TV and they made a media

1302
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:17,180
spectacle out of that, uh, while this company is still running. So it's, um, but it is it tiger

1303
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:24,140
claw. I have to admit, I thought like, is this like a weird ass tie in the movie, but I don't,

1304
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:28,460
I don't know why it would be. I also don't need it because I think the movie has to do with like

1305
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:37,020
murder and stuff that I don't know if Gucci necessarily, um, yeah, but also, um,

1306
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:42,620
Crap. I was gonna, I was gonna say something else, but I know a lot of other,

1307
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:48,220
the designer companies like to work with tech companies to do like, well, and Gucci also

1308
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:55,260
worked with a Fiat for a Gucci edition, uh, uh, Abarth or however they're pronounced.

1309
02:07:55,900 --> 02:08:04,220
Um, cause I kind of wanted one. Um, and I mean, Hermes has the deal with Apple for Apple watches

1310
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:08,940
and it's designers do this all the time. So

1311
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:18,300
anyway. All right. Sorry. I'm, I'm, I'm texting Shane because the earlier question that came up

1312
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:24,540
about, uh, Pokemon, I would just text to Shane. I said, do I get diamond or Pearl? And he just

1313
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:29,260
replied with a P he just replied. I don't know if I probably, he just replied with the picture

1314
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:34,140
that shows all the differences between the two. Like he didn't even, he just replied with the

1315
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:38,540
picture that Mike Deft was probably about to send me. And so I'm looking at it and I'm like, okay,

1316
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:42,780
I think I want diamond. So I replied to him and I said, I think I'm going to get diamond,

1317
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:48,460
but I really want a Vulpix, which is in Pearl. He says, what makes diamond Pearl before?

1318
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:51,820
Yeah. And he's like, what makes diamond more appealing? And I'm like, literally everything

1319
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:56,860
else. I'm like, I, a lot of the trade for a Vulpix. Yeah, I can trade for a Vulpix. And I'm

1320
02:08:56,860 --> 02:09:02,380
like looking at the rest. I'm like, I prefer Electabuzz to Magmar. Uh, I like Scyther, uh,

1321
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:08,300
versus Pincer, especially. I like that, that thing that evolves into Cranados, I think is the name.

1322
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:13,740
I don't really care for the, uh, other one on the other side. Seal is cute. I can't, I,

1323
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:19,180
I really don't like the Slow Bros and they're all in the other one. Uh, Miles is cute. Yeah. It's,

1324
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:24,300
and Tyranitar, which is, you know, I love that whole line too. Uh, and then it has the dogs

1325
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:28,700
versus the bird. Yeah. I'm like everything in diamond. I kind of like better. Um, so there

1326
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:33,500
you go. I guess I'm going to get diamond. All right. Oh, that's. I'm just going to go listen

1327
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:40,620
to Prince. And if you don't get it, you're a kid. Oh yeah. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Um,

1328
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:45,180
let's get into the next story, which is another Twitch story, funny enough, but very different

1329
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:49,100
from what we were talking about before. Uh, you know, Twitch does a lot, not just with gaming,

1330
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:53,580
but there's a lot of music creation and content that's going on there. And Twitch is going to be

1331
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:59,900
targeting musicians, uh, with a new program. It's called the collective and it's going to invite

1332
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:05,100
selected musicians. It's an invite only collective. Uh, and from there you get more

1333
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:09,100
information on how do you build communities? How do you earn money through fans on the streaming

1334
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:15,900
platform? Um, this was all announced on Twitter by the head of music and V VP, uh, who is Tracy P

1335
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:20,540
Chan on Twitter and, uh, talked a little more about it, how they're planning to support and

1336
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:26,140
so forth. What I think is interesting about this is that they actually have, um, partners with

1337
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:30,460
rolling stone and Amazon music and those types of partnerships can be huge in getting discovered.

1338
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:35,900
I'm sure, especially rolling stone. Uh, so once you're a musician, you graduate from this program,

1339
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:40,860
you get eligible for prioritize discovery, promotion and activations from Twitch.

1340
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:45,020
So that's interesting. I'll be curious if any musician friends, I'm sure there's stuff in

1341
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:48,700
there that has to be kept secret, which is why they're not really detailing what really is in

1342
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:53,900
the collective. Um, so it'll be interesting to see, uh, friends that I know that are getting

1343
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:59,340
involved with that, uh, and what that all entails and how that goes. But, you know, it's just

1344
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:06,860
very telling of the, the digital path forward, uh, our society is taking. So, all right.

1345
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:12,380
Interesting bonds, double six and chat. I'm just seeing this about the Gucci thing.

1346
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:17,180
I have done internships for house of Gucci for eight months. They're all right. I got a $100

1347
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:22,460
belt as a present. Love it. If I paid a hundred dollars for a fucking belt, I'd love it too.

1348
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:28,620
Um, um, Alan has always told me he wants a Burberry coat and, you know, do you know how

1349
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:35,020
much those fucking coats are from Burberry? That is, is I would have to, I would have to mortgage

1350
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:39,740
someone's house to pay for, you know, they're, they're not cheap. It's yeah. So, or at least

1351
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:44,060
I said, maybe I'll get you a scarf. That's a couple hundred dollars that I could save up

1352
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:48,300
the money and get you one of those, but that's like your big Christmas present for the year.

1353
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:56,060
It's a scarf. So we'll see. All right. Um, I was going to go to our next story, but it looks like,

1354
02:11:56,060 --> 02:12:01,020
uh, dark soccer. Oh, hi. All right. Uh, then I just went to go put my bowl in the sink.

1355
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:04,140
Oh, no worries. Then why don't we go to our next story? If you're ready.

1356
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:12,300
All right. So, um, I'm sure people remember that when, um, mass effect legendary edition came out,

1357
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:18,140
they couldn't do the pinnacle, uh, deals, the pinnacle station DLC, because the code was,

1358
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:26,300
was gone. In fact, when they got, um, the information, the, uh, the backups from a Demiurge

1359
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:32,620
who, uh, did the DLC for them, it was super corrupted vital links for missing. They couldn't

1360
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:45,020
do anything with it, but thanks to mods. The DLC is back. Um, it is updated, um, graphically

1361
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:54,540
with difficulty adjusted extra music and sound effects and the old, uh, kind of 2009 ishness,

1362
02:12:54,540 --> 02:13:05,180
uh, polished out of it. Um, they actually had a blog post for how they managed to get it done.

1363
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:13,020
And I'm, I'm absolutely, absolutely impressed that, that they could do it. I mean,

1364
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:21,020
they, they even put in like some of their, uh, some of the coding, uh, differences, uh,

1365
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:27,820
where, how they rebuilt those particular pathways to get it done. Um, I thought it was absolutely,

1366
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:33,420
absolutely a labor of love and I thought it was, was pretty good. You, um, you can actually get

1367
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:40,940
it from nexus mods and I will, uh, post the link in chat. Um, everyone else is just going to have

1368
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:48,460
to go look for it, but there you go. You can now play pinnacle station again. Here we go again with

1369
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:56,300
the modders saving the day, although, you know, again, let's DMC strike them now. The reason why

1370
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:01,020
Bioware admitted it or omitted it in the first place, they didn't do it for any sort of greedy

1371
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:04,860
or lazy reason. I get it. They didn't have the source code, you know, it was a different issue,

1372
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:11,180
but it's, it's fascinating that again, modders just recreated it touch for touch. So there you

1373
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:22,460
go. It's all for love. Yep. Sure is. All right. Moving on Loki. Yep. So, um, battlefield 2042,

1374
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:26,460
which is one of the games that's coming out this week, it's having some issues with the early

1375
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:31,580
access. Maybe you may remember EA has this wonderful program to where you can actually

1376
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:40,060
play EA games early and you pay a premium for that. And well, it is, um, jank right now.

1377
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:46,860
I've seen reviews talking about the game saying that, you know, there's all sorts of frame rate

1378
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:52,380
issues depending on the maps that you're on, which is weird. Um, it just plays weird sometimes.

1379
02:14:53,180 --> 02:15:00,540
So they're saying that right now that even Xbox consoles are being crashed by this game,

1380
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:06,940
including the series X, um, just stops working after a while and it'll reset itself.

1381
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:13,820
So that's not good. Hopefully it's something that they're going to, uh, address also in

1382
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:17,500
order to actually be able to play this early access, you had to get one of those bundles

1383
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:22,780
as well. So it's, you know, upwards of $120 that you paid to play this game early. You paid to be

1384
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:31,180
a beta tester. So enjoy. Yeah, it's unfortunate, but this is a state that a lot of these games

1385
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:39,100
come out nowadays. EA is really bad at this. It's just, it's just another, they say just

1386
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:43,580
add it to the list games that shouldn't have come out yet. Pre-order games. Boy. Oh boy.

1387
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:49,020
All right. Well, trying to end on a positive note with a game from a smaller studio

1388
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:54,540
that is about cats, how could I not end with a cat story tonight? Right. Let's make ourselves

1389
02:15:54,540 --> 02:16:00,220
feel better after all of these, uh, not great, you know, broken game releases. Let's talk about

1390
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:06,860
Double Dagger Studio in Seattle and their upcoming game Little Kitty Big City. And it's

1391
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:13,660
going to be coming out in 2022. Uh, it's consoles and PC, although they did not say which consoles.

1392
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:20,540
Uh, the, uh, overview is you are a little kitty lost in the big city. Will you find your way home

1393
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:25,420
or are you having too much fun along the way? Little Kitty Big City is a game where you play

1394
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:30,860
a curious little kitty with a big personality on an adventure to find your way back home,

1395
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:38,060
explore the city, make new friends, wear delightful hats. I always love it when that's

1396
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:44,140
a selling point for a game and leave more than a little chaos in your wake. After all, isn't that

1397
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:49,180
what cats can do best? And they released a trailer for it, which I'm sorry. I didn't render in time

1398
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:56,540
to actually so show on stream tonight, but it just, I, it looks somewhere around like, um,

1399
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:03,100
the untitled goose game a little bit, but with the cat just kind of walking around and getting

1400
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:10,460
into trouble and talking to dogs and wearing hats and climbing up things and smashing pots and

1401
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:15,820
doing all the things that you would expect cats to do. So I'm all about this. Uh, yeah,

1402
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:20,140
Mike Deft made the same conclusion. It's goose game, but with a cat titled cat game.

1403
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:27,740
I like it. Uh, Zen Monkey 11 says, yeah, I'd play the shit out of that cat game. Sounds great. Yes.

1404
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:33,820
Quest Buster says cat with hat cat in the hat, I guess. All right, there you go. Little Kitty Big

1405
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:43,740
City. Looking forward to that in 2022 and not much else at this point. All right, let's, let's go to

1406
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:52,540
the listener round table, um, with your emails, your discord calls, uh, over at vog network.com

1407
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:56,860
slash discord, uh, and any chat questions you guys have, if you have any questions for us in chat,

1408
02:17:56,860 --> 02:18:01,020
go ahead and put them in there. Uh, first we'll take a trip to the mailbag participate

1409
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:05,900
at orange lounge, radio.com. And we'll see if we have any emails for the readings tonight,

1410
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:14,780
our Sakura who is muted and frantically looking for the button. There we go.

1411
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:19,500
I wasn't frantic on anything. Well, I have to fill this time with something. All right, go ahead.

1412
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:26,060
Hello, LR. I just wanted to formally invite the awesome audience of LR to my DDR charity stream

1413
02:18:26,060 --> 02:18:32,060
next Saturday, November 21st at 1 PM Eastern. I'll be attempting to clear max 342 times with

1414
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:38,220
at least 21 of those being on expert difficulty is the Ohio DDR max 300 birthday challenge.

1415
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:41,980
I got through it last year, but, and I don't intend to lose this time either,

1416
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:45,740
but that's not all my buddy, Dan hood, who I've been playing and practicing

1417
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:50,460
with over the last few years will also be attempting the challenge along with me.

1418
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:56,700
He's got to get through it 30 times, but is bursting with confidence and ready to go.

1419
02:18:56,700 --> 02:19:01,660
It'll be a good four hours of stomping reminiscing about the old days of DDR and ITG

1420
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:07,580
and general shenanigans we were doing. We're doing this to benefit feeding America.

1421
02:19:07,580 --> 02:19:12,220
Hunger remains a major problem across our nation, affecting millions of Americans.

1422
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:16,940
If you, if you're financially able to do so, please help us raise some money for a great cause

1423
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:20,060
would really appreciate your support. And if you want to go to my event page,

1424
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:28,140
I've made it really easy. You just go to tiny URL.com slash 2021 max 300. And you're there.

1425
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:33,020
Thanks so much for checking us out. We'll probably be using step mania for this,

1426
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:36,380
but just yesterday I learned about dance dance revolution, grand Prix, the brand new,

1427
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:40,700
just released official home version for windows. And I think if I can get it set up in time,

1428
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:46,700
we'll use that instead. I'm not sure if it may show role, but if not, here's a bit of info about

1429
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:51,340
it. The good news is that there's finally a, uh, a new home version of DDR for all of these.

1430
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:56,140
We talked about this, I think a few weeks ago, um, even better. It has the same interface tonight.

1431
02:19:56,140 --> 02:20:01,260
Yeah. Loki talked about it earlier, but yeah. Hmm. I could swear that we mentioned something

1432
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:06,380
about this before. I'm sure we've mentioned it before. Yes. The beta test came up before,

1433
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:11,180
and now it was the official release. Yeah. Okay. Even better. It has the same interface

1434
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:15,740
and almost the entire song list of current arcade version minus just a few licenses and covers.

1435
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:21,180
That's all 900 songs in total given take give or take, and it will work with any dance pad set up.

1436
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:26,300
The bad news is that the cost and accessibility are similar to other current Konami PC releases,

1437
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:31,260
meaning you need a Japanese account to get it. There are subscription fees and there are pay per

1438
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:36,300
play fees on top of that, depending on what modes you want to access to summarize, you can play

1439
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:42,940
without a subscription of the equivalent of 110 yen per three songs set, uh, the songs features

1440
02:20:42,940 --> 02:20:47,340
and options are available are roughly equivalent to what you would get if you walked up to the

1441
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:53,500
arcade machine and played it without logging in, but you would lose out on the newest, uh,

1442
02:20:55,020 --> 02:21:00,780
unlockable songs, plus, uh, several options and features that are unavailable in the arcade,

1443
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:05,580
unless you log in, such as the ability to save your scores. If you choose to subscribe for about

1444
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:10,060
15 bucks a month, you get access to those features, but you still have to pay for each game on top of

1445
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:15,020
that. However, fully included in a subscription is the additional unlimited play mode that gives

1446
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:19,260
you access to everything in the song list up to DDR supernova two. And it doesn't cost anything

1447
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:26,700
per game to play that well, apart from the subscription itself, excuse me. Um, so in other

1448
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:31,660
words, yes, it costs a lot, but you can base it, but it is basically the entire arcade game and

1449
02:21:31,660 --> 02:21:36,780
it's a hundred percent legal. So you can stream it without repercussions and just about all of

1450
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:42,380
the music in the game. What I said, wow. And just about all of the music.

1451
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:46,300
Yeah. I don't know about that. I would be careful just now.

1452
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:51,100
And just about all of the music in the game is fully owned by Konami. So copyright strikes

1453
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:57,100
are probably unlikely to happen. So for those folks who have great setups at home and are able

1454
02:21:57,100 --> 02:22:01,980
to afford the steep pricing, it might be worth it to try. If you want to look in to it further,

1455
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:08,380
ddrcommunity.com has excellent guides. Thanks again for the show and for Signal Boost. I hope

1456
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:14,780
that you will be able to join us at 1 PM Eastern next Sunday afternoon at tinyurl slash 2021 max

1457
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:20,540
300 sweaty hugs, Aaron, Y Y R sweaty hugs. I like that. Yeah. It's going to be 10 AM our time.

1458
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:24,700
That'll be right around the time I'm getting up. Uh, yeah, yeah. That's probably, we'll still be

1459
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:30,540
in bed, but I I'll check it out for sure. Yeah. Um, I have to make a reminder on my calendar or

1460
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:35,260
I'll forget, but, um, best of luck with that. I love that. I like that you're making it a charity

1461
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:41,340
event out of that. Uh, and good luck with that. So that's, that's great. I would say break a leg,

1462
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:46,620
but I feel like for this, I really shouldn't actually say that. So, um, don't break a leg.

1463
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:53,180
All right. Um, if that's it for emails, I will encourage folks to send more participate

1464
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:59,340
at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send emails. Uh, let me check the discord room over

1465
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:04,940
time. Nope. Nobody's in there yet. Uh, and then in chat, uh, just some folks commenting on the,

1466
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:11,180
uh, DDR, uh, uh, grant grand PRI breakdown, uh, bonds, double six saying paywall everywhere

1467
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:15,980
and orange, right. Saying grand PRI is expensive. Yeah. Um, but it is interesting. You're kind of

1468
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:20,940
getting an arcade perfect version where essentially, as far as we know, pretty much legally, I mean,

1469
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:25,420
we don't know what weird third parties might try to claim, but I think a lot of those songs are

1470
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:31,180
done in house or, or created by Konami. So, uh, he said they, they carved out the license stuff

1471
02:23:31,180 --> 02:23:35,820
for the most part. So I would hope so. I just, I, I'm always worried about that stuff. Yeah,

1472
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:39,500
I understand. I get it. I get it. So, but if they're going to be kind of like talking while

1473
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:44,780
they're going through it too, that'll help a lot too. So, all right. Uh, Jason is suggesting,

1474
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:49,660
uh, the well wish I could send is don't fall off. All right. There you go. Don't fall off while

1475
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:55,260
you're with your birthday fundraiser. All right. Well, I think with that, then we'll go ahead and

1476
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:59,740
wrap up another edition of OLR. I want to thank you guys for downloading our show this week or

1477
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:03,660
listening to us live, however you participated with our show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1478
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:07,980
Appreciate you guys. Uh, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word

1479
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:12,860
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to put out on

1480
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:19,020
air. Um, so, uh, please, uh, tell a friend or two about the show. Um, spread the word,

1481
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:23,260
get them here in chat, participate with the show. It would really mean the world. Um,

1482
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:29,820
and, uh, if you feel so inclined, you'll notice I'm wearing a VOG branded shirt and that's available,

1483
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:35,100
uh, at the shop, vognetwork.com slash shop. If you want to check that out, uh, you don't have to,

1484
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:41,900
but if you feel so inclined, uh, appreciate that. Um, a nice social media tweet, a five-star review

1485
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:46,460
where you found this podcast, all of it goes a long way. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate

1486
02:24:46,460 --> 02:24:51,900
the support. Let's go around and get folks final thought. I should wait before I do the final

1487
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:56,860
thoughts. Let me address this because I see Tiger Claw in chat says, you know, G4 TV's relaunches

1488
02:24:56,860 --> 02:25:04,700
this Tuesday, November 16th. I don't think on principle, we should just give that a news

1489
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:10,620
headline. Like when they do something newsworthy, we'll talk about it. Um, but I'm kind of

1490
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:15,820
expect, I'm going to be honest and maybe I will be proved wrong.

1491
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:22,700
I just kind of expect a lot of sophomore crap. That was what G4 was at the end of its run.

1492
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:31,340
And the reality is G4 has to be competitive now with Twitch and, uh, other ways that people

1493
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:36,460
consume content and gamer related content in this day and age. I wish them well. I know people

1494
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:43,740
that are involved. Good luck, but I, and it's, it's none of those people I'm concerned about.

1495
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:49,340
It's people at the top. If there's been one, if there's been one message tonight,

1496
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:59,260
executives ruin everything. There it is. All right. Anyway. Um, let's, uh, get everybody's

1497
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:03,740
final, final thought. Dark soccer, your final, I appreciate you bringing up the comment though.

1498
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:07,260
I just wanted to explain why we haven't really talked more about it. Um,

1499
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:13,100
Oh, the G4 thing. Not, not you drag. I was sorry. The G4 thing. I appreciate you bringing it up. I

1500
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:16,540
just want to address why we haven't talked more about it. I just, I don't see why we should.

1501
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:22,460
All right. Dark soccer. Uh, your final thought. Um, I'll go ahead and open up on this one. Um,

1502
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:32,780
I am being tested for narcolepsy, which is, uh, a test by omission. So, um, wish me luck.

1503
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:39,900
Is that this week or no, cause you know, um, what I'll say, so I'll just, I'll give the details.

1504
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:44,700
So the weaning off of my medication is because the medications that I'm on right now are actually

1505
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:51,100
used to treat narcolepsy. They have to take me off of my antidepressants and my sleeping meds

1506
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:55,500
and a couple of other things, which I may have to quit cold Turkey to get it out of my system.

1507
02:26:55,500 --> 02:27:00,220
I've actually started weaning myself until they give me my date. And then two weeks

1508
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:06,940
before my sleep lab, I stopped taking them whether I'm weaned off or not. Um,

1509
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:13,100
and then I do my sleep lab and then a week after that, I should hopefully be back on my meds and

1510
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:21,500
back to okay. But I am not a very good person to be around when I am not on my meds. I am on them

1511
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:27,900
for a very important reason. So, um, when that goes down, I am going to make an announcement.

1512
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:37,020
I am off my meds. And if I snap at you, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. So there you go. Blanket message.

1513
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:44,620
All right. Um, all right. Uh, well have a good, I'm assuming you're streaming as usual after

1514
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:49,660
the show tonight. So have a good stream. All right. Yep. Have fun. All right. Bye.

1515
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:52,300
And we'll go to Loki with your final thought tonight.

1516
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:58,940
Uh, my final thought is I have a lot of work to do on my episode.

1517
02:28:00,060 --> 02:28:04,220
Well, yeah, good luck. That'll be coming out soon. It's a really cool build. It's fun. It's

1518
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:08,300
all farms. And then it's also Hermitcraft themed. I've really got to get away from that,

1519
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:13,980
but it's fun. I had an idea for a pun at the beginning of the season and so I finally got

1520
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:22,220
around to it. All right. Uh, and my final thought is, um, it's been a crazy last two weeks. I'm kind

1521
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:26,540
of glad that I have some stuff sort of out there in the open now. Um, and I'm not just kind of

1522
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:30,860
stewing on it. And, uh, thanks again, everybody for being very lovely about it. And it's nice

1523
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:37,740
to know that I'm not alone. Um, the future will be bright. I have spoken it into existence.

1524
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:43,740
It will happen. Uh, there is, there is nothing you can do about it. The future will be bright.

1525
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:49,340
That's going to do it. Have a great, have a bright seven days and, uh, enjoy all the games coming

1526
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:54,460
out. Pokemon fans, enjoy those remakes. Battlefield, whatever else you're into,

1527
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:59,180
enjoy all that other good stuff that's coming out this week. Have a wonderful, wonderful time,

1528
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:04,860
and we'll see you back here in seven days to do it all again as black Friday, Thanksgiving,

1529
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:08,540
and the real, I mean, I know people are breaking out the Mariah Carey already,

1530
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:13,100
but the real holiday season really starts getting into full swing. Have a wonderful week,

1531
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:15,420
