WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
As I read the news this week, I was going to defend Streamlabs based on my own experiences

00:14.760 --> 00:17.400
in open source software, forks, derivatives, and so on.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.040
Then I saw that they filed for the legal right of a name that includes OBS, and we all know

00:22.040 --> 00:25.480
how well that worked out for In the Groove, which didn't even include the name DDR,

00:25.480 --> 00:28.880
just the entire technical foundation of it.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.680
This is another story of foolish decisions.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.720
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you more

00:33.720 --> 00:36.680
in this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.680 --> 00:38.240
every gamer has a voice.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.960
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.960 --> 00:54.920
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live with y'all once again, episode number 892

00:54.920 --> 01:00.520
of our show, live on this November the 21st of 2021.

01:00.520 --> 01:08.120
Happy 19 November, 20 November to those back in the good old DDR days where the roots of

01:08.120 --> 01:13.600
our show were made, and happy 21 November, even though I don't think that song actually

01:13.600 --> 01:15.080
exists, but it should.

01:15.080 --> 01:22.760
Hi, I am Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, hello, who

01:22.760 --> 01:23.760
is muted.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
Let's try again.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
Hello.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
Crap.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
Gosh.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
Hi.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
Hi.

01:29.800 --> 01:30.800
How are you doing?

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
I'm okay.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.800
I'm liking the new angle tonight.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.800
We get to see a little bit different angle of the lair of DarkSakura.

01:37.800 --> 01:45.840
I finally, I had the hardest time finding a clamp that could sit on my big widescreen

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
monitor.

01:46.840 --> 01:53.000
So finally I found a different kind of mount that I could clamp to the, you and I have

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
the same IKEA desk.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.240
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
I remember that.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:57.240 --> 02:03.520
So I have a clamp that now will sit up there and have my phone, because I use my iPhone

02:03.520 --> 02:09.280
as my webcam because it's far better than any webcam on the market.

02:09.280 --> 02:15.440
And so I needed it a little bit more central and now it is, and people can see every time

02:15.440 --> 02:21.120
I dip in, when I move with the camera, every time I try to kill people in Dead by Daylight.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.600
I need to get a mic arm for my office.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.400
I really like this one I have here in the old studio where we used to gather pre-COVID,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.480
but I like this mic arm.

02:30.480 --> 02:35.120
I need something like this that'll hold my Elgato mic, because I just bought a new, now

02:35.120 --> 02:37.600
I can't even remember the name of it, but it's Elgato's microphone.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.880
That's basically the response to Blue Yeti.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.880
And I heard good things about it.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.880
It's nice.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
I like it.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.320
It's what?

02:45.360 --> 02:52.120
I was going to say the Audio-Technica one that I have is, actually mine came with my

02:52.120 --> 02:54.160
arm and everything with it.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.640
And it's been an absolute delight.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
Gotcha.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.300
Mike Deff says the Wave 3.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.300
Thank you.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.300
That is the name of it.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.300
Thanks, Mike.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.300
Hi.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.400
And that is our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

03:05.400 --> 03:08.280
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:08.280 --> 03:13.480
I will, twitch.tv slash, no, I haven't, Vogue Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

03:13.480 --> 03:14.480
show.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.640
And of course, I'm going to say hello to Techmaster Loki and his mic arm as well.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
Hi, Loki.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.640
Hello.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
How are you doing?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.640
I'm doing fine.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.000
I'm a little tired because I've been staying up till three in the morning each day.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.200
I hear you've been working hard on that, Mike, because I know I've seen a lot of tweets.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.120
You've been really trying to kind of like wrap up your current storyline Minecraft so

03:32.120 --> 03:36.920
you can move on to, I know you've got a new kind of thing for Minecraft, right?

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
So

03:37.920 --> 03:44.440
I've been playing Minecraft, but I've actually been playing just on their server.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, their certain aircraft, just to mess around.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.280
And so that's what I've been busy doing up until three in the morning.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.240
But yes, this week, though, I did take off to actually work on that, because I do have

03:56.240 --> 03:57.360
to finish up some builds.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.000
I already have the last two episodes of the season planned already.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.400
So I just have to do the things.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.520
And I have one, thankfully, one of them is going to be a server tour, which is very low

04:07.520 --> 04:08.520
effort.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.360
No, I mean, it's not low effort, but it's just like, I don't have to build anything

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
else to design anything.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.520
So it goes quicker.

04:14.520 --> 04:22.160
But I still have to finish polishing up my base a bit so that it's kind of complete,

04:22.160 --> 04:23.160
you know.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.240
But yeah, it's gonna be fun.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Yeah.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.600
So, you know, a lot of people took off this next week for the holidays and all that stuff.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.600
So, yeah.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.080
Happy Thanksgiving to all the folks out there in OLR land, at least the ones in the States,

04:37.080 --> 04:38.080
Canada.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
You already had yours.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.280
And Hanukkah is the week after.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.280
Oh, that's right.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.000
It's really early this year, relatively, isn't it?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.680
Well, keep in mind, it follows a lunar calendar.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.840
I know, but still.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.040
But not everybody knows that, so that's why I'm saying it.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.040
Yeah.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.040
Yeah.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.600
So it's the same reason why Easter, you know, changes every year because it actually follows

05:00.600 --> 05:04.880
the same calendar that all the other Jewish holidays follow.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.880
Sure.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.720
So, but my body doesn't follow or my work schedule don't follow the lunar calendar.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.440
So it is a little novel to see Hanukkah in November.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.800
That's not usually the way it is.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.880
It's not the first time, though.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.520
I'm pretty sure I've seen it this early before.

05:18.520 --> 05:22.980
It's been pretty funny because like all the last few years, it's actually been, if not

05:22.980 --> 05:26.760
the same week as Christmas and awfully close to it.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
Right.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.280
And which made everything easier for planning holiday stuff, but not this year.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.280
So c'est la vie.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.280
It is what it is.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.280
That's okay.

05:35.280 --> 05:42.080
I'll still have latkes until the end of the year.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.320
Yum, yum, yum.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.640
Wishing everyone, no matter where you are in the world, a happy Thanksgiving and in

05:47.640 --> 05:54.040
the spirit of being thankful for, you know, the good things you have going on this year.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.160
Hopefully, you know, it's been a year of a lot of ups and downs for me, but I try to

05:58.160 --> 06:00.040
focus on the ups and being thankful.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.880
And of course, I'm thankful for Sunday nights.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.880
I really am.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.480
I'm thankful to hang out here with you guys and talk about what's going on in gaming.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.220
I'm thankful for my co-hosts who are just as crazy as I am, quite frankly, when it comes

06:12.220 --> 06:15.680
to having the dedication to do this for as long as we've been doing it, heading into

06:15.680 --> 06:18.800
our 20th year in a few weeks, if you can believe it.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
What were we thinking?

06:19.800 --> 06:26.920
I don't know, but this, I'm going to be honest, like this has been a hard week to be a gaming

06:26.920 --> 06:27.920
fan.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.040
There's a lot, there's some hard news this week that's really, really frustrating.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.160
And we're going to get into that in a minute.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.100
Let me try to start with something positive.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.840
How about we do a feedback sandwich?

06:38.840 --> 06:42.720
We'll do positive, then we'll do negative, then we'll do our gaming weeks back to positive.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.900
So let's start with positive.

06:43.900 --> 06:50.120
I want to give a shout out to YYR, our listener who's here a lot and emails us a lot.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.800
And you might remember our last, on last week's show, he said he was going to do a stream.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.560
I only was able to catch a little bit of it via mobile because I was, I'm really focused

06:57.560 --> 06:59.000
on my health and my walking and all that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.720
And it just kind of happened to be around the same time, but I caught some of it.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.460
And then I caught the big announcement, which we, I think I retweeted it on the OLR account,

07:06.460 --> 07:09.680
but his game, so he's an indie game developer, right?

07:09.680 --> 07:14.760
And you know, he developed the original Pixel Poops from an idea that came from Dark Sakura

07:14.760 --> 07:20.960
and us here at OLR, which then Loki evolved into the sequel that he's talked about.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.520
That's now featured in magazines as seen in Cool Shit Magazine, Pixel Poops number two.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.360
I have, I have five copies coming.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.720
I ordered a few copies to come in.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
That's great.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.640
Um, so, but of course YYR, he's developed other games.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.160
He's got a lot of cool games that are out there on Steam and otherwise, you know, um,

07:38.160 --> 07:42.560
I like falling as a, as a retro throwback, but one of the other big games he launched

07:42.560 --> 07:45.620
is super multitasking, which I'm telling you guys, it's really good.

07:45.620 --> 07:49.480
It's like playing WarioWare four times at once.

07:49.480 --> 07:58.320
Well, YYR announced on his stream, he's adding to it a dance game pad mode and get, it's,

07:58.320 --> 08:03.080
it's not just controlling the existing games, but there's a dance game thrown in.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.520
No, no, no.

08:04.520 --> 08:09.300
What happens is that there's like a dance game that plays in the middle bar that you

08:09.300 --> 08:11.720
have to step on the arrows and do all that shit.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.620
Meanwhile, the other three lanes are still lighting up with games that you're playing

08:15.620 --> 08:19.000
on your controller while you are dancing.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It's brilliant.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
For fuck's sake.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
It's, it's brilliant.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.160
What does he think we're made of?

08:23.160 --> 08:26.140
I don't understand why this game hasn't gone viral.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.140
It's so good.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.220
So super multitasking.

08:28.220 --> 08:32.420
And I think you'd have to have the superpowers of a single mother.

08:32.420 --> 08:36.560
So anyway, check that out on Steam if you haven't already over at super multitasking.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
Yay YYR.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.560
Yay, Aaron.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.560
Yay.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.560
Good news.

08:40.560 --> 08:41.560
Love that.

08:41.560 --> 08:45.660
Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, I heard he threw down the gauntlet to Chris for life to try

08:45.660 --> 08:46.660
it out.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.060
Uh, yeah, he was tagged in that tweet.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.220
So, uh, I thought that was, uh, pretty funny.

08:50.220 --> 08:51.220
So I hope he does.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.220
It's great.

08:52.220 --> 08:53.220
Okay.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.500
Um, not so great news.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.900
Uh, let's get into it.

08:56.900 --> 08:57.900
Look here.

08:57.900 --> 09:02.180
I know many of you at OLR, you know what's coming because you're tuned to gaming blogs.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.180
You probably listen to other podcasts.

09:04.180 --> 09:06.380
You are on social media.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.460
So you know why I'm about to give a hearty fuck you to Bobby Kotick.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.620
And in fact, it's at a point it needs to go further than that.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.220
I'll get into that in a moment.

09:15.380 --> 09:20.580
Um, and it's just this Activision story that will not quit.

09:20.580 --> 09:25.300
And I think we all clearly see the reason why it will not quit.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.660
That reason is becoming very apparent this week.

09:28.660 --> 09:33.820
However, I know there's a handful of you that, you know, you're more casual gamers.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.300
Maybe you don't follow all the headlines, but you listen to OLR cause you like me, Jamie

09:37.300 --> 09:38.300
and Matt.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.300
Thank you for that.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.580
Love ya.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.820
This is a difficult content or this is a difficult topic.

09:43.820 --> 09:48.820
Content warning, everything like it's, it's, it's awful.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.260
This, this is awful.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.260
I hate it.

09:51.260 --> 09:57.580
And this is why I'm saying when it comes to being a gamer this week, this story sucks.

09:57.580 --> 10:04.460
And the fact that it is not already resolved by his firing, his releasing sucks more.

10:04.460 --> 10:07.020
Anyway, I've got plenty more rants coming.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.740
Let's go to the facts.

10:08.740 --> 10:15.140
Ricky, um, tell us about some of the things that have developed with the CEO of Activision

10:15.140 --> 10:18.540
blizzards, King Bobby Kotick this week.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.540
Yeah.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.180
So there was a report done by the wall street journal that kind of talked about some of

10:23.180 --> 10:29.300
the allegations, um, that were happening kind of behind the whole California lawsuit.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.020
And they said that over the years, um, that apparently Mr. Kotick has been accused by

10:34.020 --> 10:37.980
several women of mistreatment, both inside and outside of the workplace.

10:37.980 --> 10:43.600
And in some instances has worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly, which

10:43.600 --> 10:47.340
you know, it sounds like a person with money would do so, uh, makes sense.

10:47.340 --> 10:56.180
Um, he also apparently was, uh, there was a flight attendant that, or his private flight

10:56.180 --> 11:00.140
jet flight attendant who was suing him for sexual harassment.

11:00.140 --> 11:05.660
Um, that was committed, I guess, by the pilot of his jet saying, I'm going to destroy you.

11:05.660 --> 11:11.340
Um, and then, yeah, just lots of different examples of that kind of stuff.

11:11.340 --> 11:16.540
So that's, that's kind of the kicking off point right here is as if it wasn't bad enough

11:16.540 --> 11:17.540
already.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.460
Now there's this kind of a bombshell report.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.460
Sorry, Loki.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.660
I'm going to do this to you a lot.

11:21.660 --> 11:25.940
I'm going to jump in because I'm not saying this in a, I was right kind of way, but I'm

11:25.940 --> 11:26.940
saying this.

11:27.660 --> 11:32.380
I, I hate that this has just proven true.

11:32.380 --> 11:39.020
I said way back when, when this first started, I said, the culture of a company is set at

11:39.020 --> 11:40.120
the top.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.640
It's set at the very top.

11:42.640 --> 11:47.280
And at the time I was pointing the finger a little bit of Bobby Kotek, I backed off

11:47.280 --> 11:52.540
a little bit with that response that came up and I shouldn't have this, this news that's

11:52.540 --> 11:53.540
coming out.

11:53.540 --> 11:59.660
This just proves that shit culture was started at the top.

11:59.660 --> 12:00.660
Continue Loki.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.660
Sorry.

12:01.660 --> 12:02.660
Oh no.

12:02.660 --> 12:03.660
It gets worse.

12:03.660 --> 12:04.660
It's not just him.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.820
It's not just him, but then let's, let's get into some other details.

12:06.820 --> 12:14.060
So we have former blizzard technology chief built Ben Kilgore, who was fired in 2018 and

12:14.060 --> 12:18.660
after investigation for multiple allegations of sexual harassment, but he was thanked for

12:18.660 --> 12:22.940
his many contribute contributions over the last four and a half years.

12:23.340 --> 12:29.060
Javier Panamaino, who was the former supervisor at Sledgehammer Games.

12:29.060 --> 12:35.500
And he was accused of raping one woman and sexually harassing a second one.

12:35.500 --> 12:44.820
Apparently they had reported those instances to the HR and back in 2017, but they apparently

12:44.820 --> 12:49.060
did not investigate the allegations or fire the supervisor.

12:49.220 --> 12:56.580
Dan Bunting, co-head of Treyarch, which apparently he was accused of sexual harassing a female

12:56.580 --> 13:00.060
coworker in 2017, after a night of drinking.

13:00.060 --> 13:05.660
In 2019, an internal investigation reported that he recommended that he be fired, but

13:05.660 --> 13:12.940
that Bobby Kotek intervened to prevent that firing and saying that after considering the

13:12.940 --> 13:18.100
potential actions in light of that investigation, the company elected not to terminate Mr. Bunting,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.500
but instead oppose other disciplinary measures.

13:20.500 --> 13:27.380
So we have a lot of like all of the higher ups, just all of these harassment allegations.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.020
I mean, there's a ton of smoke.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.460
Because the culture was set at the top.

13:32.460 --> 13:33.940
Yeah.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.300
Disgusting.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.660
And he's been protecting these people.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.420
It's like, he's like best buds with Yves Guimond.

13:41.420 --> 13:46.420
I mean, peas in a pod.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.420
What about...

13:47.740 --> 13:48.740
Go ahead.

13:48.740 --> 13:49.740
Go ahead.

13:49.740 --> 13:50.740
Let Jamie speak.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.740
Go ahead.

13:51.740 --> 14:00.260
I'm also going to add in, though, that this is what happens when men are raised with a

14:00.260 --> 14:05.620
disrespect for women.

14:05.620 --> 14:13.220
It starts at home and then corporate wide, it starts at the top, like you said.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.540
It's a symptom of a bigger problem.

14:15.540 --> 14:20.420
And we're now really seeing very obvious results of this.

14:20.420 --> 14:23.020
This is why feminism exists.

14:23.020 --> 14:26.620
Just saying right now, this is why we're not shutting up and this is why it gets louder

14:26.620 --> 14:27.860
and louder.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.540
So please continue.

14:29.540 --> 14:30.540
Yeah.

14:30.540 --> 14:37.580
So since he was found to be not only ignoring and downplaying harassment against female

14:37.580 --> 14:40.500
employees for a very long time now.

14:40.500 --> 14:49.380
So there were, of course, the Activision Blizzard employees there, the Workers Alliance,

14:49.380 --> 14:54.100
that's basically said, you know, we're staging a walkout because we want him to resign.

14:54.100 --> 14:57.960
And of course, he's not going to resign.

14:57.960 --> 15:03.300
So they even put out a petition to have him quit as well.

15:03.300 --> 15:09.600
They have twelve hundred signatures of different employees at the company.

15:09.600 --> 15:15.920
I mean, clearly people want him to go, but he ain't going, unfortunately.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.920
Where's the part?

15:16.920 --> 15:20.680
Can you can you skip to the part about Jen O'Neill and everything that she's been going

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
through?

15:21.680 --> 15:24.600
Because this is the part to me that just underlines like this.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.520
This is that he he is lying now.

15:29.520 --> 15:33.120
This is not even like and when they when they come into this whole stuff about we're going

15:33.120 --> 15:35.480
to fix it and these things are in the past.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.900
No, bitch.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.640
He has you all fooled.

15:39.640 --> 15:45.220
He is lying now after everything came out.

15:45.220 --> 15:48.340
He is still treating women like shit.

15:48.340 --> 15:49.340
No.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.300
So Jennifer, unequal pay and all this.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.300
Go ahead, Logie.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.300
Yeah.

15:53.300 --> 16:00.020
So basically she had been there revealed that she had been sexually harassed at the company

16:00.020 --> 16:04.980
earlier in her career and basically saying that I've been token tokenized, marginalized

16:04.980 --> 16:07.140
and discriminated against.

16:07.140 --> 16:15.940
And, you know, even attended, I guess, was a party in 2007 with Bobby Kotick in which

16:15.940 --> 16:20.620
they had like, I guess, strippers dancing on stripper poles or something like that and

16:20.620 --> 16:26.460
encourage female attendees to drink more so the men would have a better time.

16:26.460 --> 16:29.940
So fun stuff.

16:29.940 --> 16:33.600
I would like for him to just be castrated.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.960
He needs he needs to go yesterday.

16:35.960 --> 16:44.560
Bobby Kotick needed to be fired by the board yesterday and Monday or whenever this news

16:44.560 --> 16:47.600
came out Monday, Tuesday, whatever happened, he should have been escorted out by the board

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
the next day.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.180
I can't believe and I am enraged.

16:51.180 --> 16:59.000
I am enraged as a gamer, as somebody, as a fucking human being that is sick of this shit.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.520
I am enraged that this motherfucker is still in power over at Activision Blizzard.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
Fuck him.

17:05.520 --> 17:10.040
And I am fucking pissed that this board is enabling him, allowing him to stay in this

17:10.040 --> 17:12.040
position.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.000
Did you hear this story that broke three hours ago?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Can't wait for this.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.480
You ready for a new twist?

17:18.480 --> 17:24.020
Bobby Kotick, the Wall Street Journal, because they have they clearly clearly they are leaks

17:24.020 --> 17:25.020
on.

17:25.020 --> 17:28.920
There are very big leaks on the inside from people that recognize there is a big problem.

17:28.920 --> 17:34.080
Well, the Wall Street Journal mentioned that Kotick met with Blizzard executives on Friday

17:34.080 --> 17:41.220
and said, quote, he would consider leaving the company if he can't quickly fix the culture

17:41.220 --> 17:44.860
problems at the video game giant.

17:44.860 --> 17:49.480
From the Wall Street Journal report, Mr. Kotick, who has led Activision for three decades,

17:49.480 --> 17:53.040
stopped short of saying he would step down in a Friday meeting with executives of the

17:53.040 --> 17:57.380
company Blizzard Entertainment Unit, but left the possibility open if misconduct issues

17:57.420 --> 18:00.140
around the company weren't fixed with speed.

18:00.140 --> 18:06.000
These people said it has been 30 years.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.260
Of this culture.

18:08.260 --> 18:14.180
That Bobby Kotick has set the time for the killer is in the house.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.420
The problem is in the house.

18:17.420 --> 18:27.240
The issue is Bobby Kotick, who must go now.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.000
And that's it.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.500
And I am so enraged with this to a point, and I I will no longer stand by and enable

18:35.500 --> 18:37.140
this company.

18:37.140 --> 18:41.480
And I feel horrible saying this because I know people that work at Blizzard.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.000
I know people that work at Activision.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.480
I know people that were laid off at Blizzard while Bobby Kotick continued to receive a

18:46.480 --> 18:47.600
huge bonus.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.280
That's a whole other point.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.020
And I know these are good people.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.340
These are victims.

18:52.340 --> 18:57.940
These are victims of this culture that Bobby Kotick is set.

18:57.940 --> 19:04.340
Why doesn't the zero tolerance policy that was set apply to the man at the top?

19:04.340 --> 19:08.980
Why is the board not applying that policy consistently?

19:08.980 --> 19:14.780
And as far as I'm concerned, I want nothing to do with Activision Blizzard King until

19:14.780 --> 19:16.780
this man is removed.

19:16.780 --> 19:21.860
And when I say that, I mean, I'm not talking about their products on the show anymore.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.240
And I know there's a lot of people that are going to say big fucking deal.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.780
Nobody listens to your podcast anyway.

19:25.780 --> 19:26.780
But you know what?

19:26.780 --> 19:28.940
It's got to fucking start somewhere.

19:28.940 --> 19:35.780
I am not going to stand by and promote this fucking culture until Bobby Kotick is gone.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.980
Period.

19:37.980 --> 19:43.040
So as far as I'm concerned, as excited as I was for Diablo 4, I regret buying Diablo

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
2.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.200
I will no longer talk about those games on this show.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.140
And it sucks.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.140
As a fan of gaming and someone who is a gamer.

19:50.140 --> 19:51.980
You want to hear about those companies?

19:51.980 --> 19:55.660
I'm sorry, but you're going to need to go somewhere else.

19:55.660 --> 19:56.660
It's as simple as that.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.760
And I'm sorry to my friends that work there.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.300
And believe me, I've heard the other side.

20:01.300 --> 20:05.740
You're not helping those people by boycotting these products.

20:05.740 --> 20:06.920
I'm sorry.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.580
This is where my conscience is at.

20:09.580 --> 20:16.060
I cannot tell people to spend money that's going to ultimately end up in Bobby Kotick's

20:16.060 --> 20:17.060
pocket.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.700
I'm sorry.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.720
It's not even just that because he's there.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.780
He's actively hurting the company.

20:23.780 --> 20:29.540
I mean, basically, both the heads of PlayStation and Xbox have been disturbed by what they've

20:29.540 --> 20:31.180
been hearing.

20:31.180 --> 20:36.180
And even Xbox, you know, they said, well, you know, basically, this type of behavior

20:36.180 --> 20:37.180
has no place in industry.

20:37.180 --> 20:42.820
And they said that even reconsidering their relationship with the company.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.300
I appreciate that.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.020
I realize he has to use softer language because it's corporate speak.

20:49.020 --> 20:54.020
He can't say the things I'm saying now because he's the head of a very large gaming company.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.460
But I respect the hell out of Phil Spencer for taking that stand.

20:57.460 --> 21:02.240
I respect the hell out of him for saying, for not falling in line and letting the money

21:02.240 --> 21:03.500
do the talking.

21:03.500 --> 21:08.160
And for, you know, I'm sure Call of Duty or what the fuck ever Activision's got going

21:08.160 --> 21:10.940
on in partnership with Xbox right now.

21:11.820 --> 21:16.300
I've got a real respect for Phil Spencer to look in the face of all that and say, you

21:16.300 --> 21:19.460
know what? Maybe we need to not.

21:21.300 --> 21:27.460
So props to you and to be fair, Sony has made a I believe Sony made a similar statement

21:27.460 --> 21:28.580
and I apologize.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.620
I don't in the moment remember who, but I think that should be commended as well.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.180
I don't want to give Microsoft all of the credit I want.

21:35.660 --> 21:39.620
And this is the part that makes me feel a little better is that some of these other

21:39.620 --> 21:41.060
people are now putting the pressure on.

21:41.060 --> 21:44.780
And this, unfortunately, is the only thing the board is going to really be able to see.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.620
It was the CEO, Jim Ryan.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.740
Thank you. So thank you, Jim Ryan.

21:49.740 --> 21:54.020
Thank you, Phil Spencer. Thank you for doing what needs to be done because I'm.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.940
Yeah, money speaks.

21:55.940 --> 22:00.180
If they're going to take the money out of the pocket, then that's what I'm down for.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.100
Right. It's it's.

22:03.100 --> 22:12.820
I'll put it this way, if I were to express exactly how angry I am, I would probably have

22:12.820 --> 22:15.860
to do that and then go on a very long break.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.020
And I want to make this very clear, even though I have said.

22:24.380 --> 22:27.980
We are not going to cover Activision Blizzard King until this man is gone, which I'm hoping

22:27.980 --> 22:29.940
will be a one week boycott, quite frankly.

22:29.980 --> 22:35.380
I'm hoping next week this this all reaches, but unfortunately, the time for this to happen

22:35.380 --> 22:36.500
has already passed.

22:37.420 --> 22:42.820
So I don't know if that's the holidays messing this all up or what, but I'm standing by

22:42.820 --> 22:46.420
this. We're not talking about that company until that man is gone.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.580
So and but here's the thing, and this is very important.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.460
It is not my place.

22:51.460 --> 22:55.700
It is not your place to tell other content creators what they can and cannot play.

22:56.700 --> 23:01.740
I already told you that some people have a different outlook, that by not talking about

23:01.740 --> 23:04.060
the products, you're hurting the frontline workers.

23:04.780 --> 23:09.140
I think Bobby Kotick is a man that has already hurt frontline workers, and that's been

23:09.140 --> 23:13.620
demonstrated from the layoff that he did prior while he still pocketed a large bonus with

23:13.620 --> 23:19.180
that. So that's why that's a huge part of why I reached the conclusion that I did, is

23:19.180 --> 23:22.500
that if Bobby Kotick wants a bonus, he'll he'll lay people off.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.700
And that's really unfortunate and shitty.

23:25.380 --> 23:30.060
But again, it's not up to us to tell other content creators what they can and cannot

23:30.060 --> 23:31.940
cover. So I want to make that very clear.

23:32.140 --> 23:35.980
If you have friends that are streaming Overwatch and continue to do so or whatever, then

23:36.060 --> 23:37.340
you know what? More power to them.

23:37.980 --> 23:42.460
For example, some some deep friends here of Orange Lounge Radio that used to be a part of

23:42.460 --> 23:45.100
the Voice Geeks Network are pals over at Girls Gone Wow.

23:45.260 --> 23:50.620
I fully expect them to continue their show and talk about this community that they love,

23:50.620 --> 23:54.620
because some things are bigger than a video game.

23:54.780 --> 23:59.820
And I think the community over there is probably the only thing that's been keeping

23:59.820 --> 24:04.700
folks in check during all of this other bullshit that's been going on.

24:04.820 --> 24:10.060
And I fully support that if they want to continue to talk about that community.

24:10.060 --> 24:14.540
And honestly, it is a support group at this point.

24:18.340 --> 24:19.940
I will say this for myself.

24:20.100 --> 24:28.220
Yeah, if anybody has switched over, like on their stream to playing a game by that

24:28.220 --> 24:32.260
company, I leave and stop posting.

24:33.900 --> 24:44.620
I'm not going to help anyone benefit from a company that has done this, if that makes

24:44.620 --> 24:46.420
sense. That is my choice.

24:46.460 --> 24:49.500
I get it. And again, I hope this is over by Tuesday.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.220
I hope Bobby Kotick is out the door and we really have something to be thankful for in

24:53.220 --> 24:55.260
this industry that the poison is finally cut out.

24:56.540 --> 25:00.420
But until that happens, I'm digging my heels in.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.420
I'm getting ready to die on this hill.

25:04.060 --> 25:08.740
Once he's out, it still isn't going to be immediate.

25:09.980 --> 25:12.220
No, it's not, but it's going to go a long way.

25:12.620 --> 25:17.700
I think the first step, the board needs to be looked at as well for their failure to

25:17.700 --> 25:23.300
act. But I get that there are nuances that make things a little more complicated than

25:23.300 --> 25:25.140
that, but I'm still not happy.

25:25.980 --> 25:30.260
Oh, no, I think that once he's gone, then the board needs to be evaluated.

25:30.700 --> 25:38.860
I mean, if I had my way, there would be a third party oversight group that would step

25:38.860 --> 25:40.020
in and manage the whole thing.

25:41.020 --> 25:41.500
Agreed.

25:41.540 --> 25:47.420
Because clearly those in power at this company cannot be trusted to do the right

25:47.420 --> 25:55.460
thing. And I want to go on record saying that most this is something that's been a

25:55.460 --> 25:58.820
problem in the corporate world for a very long time.

25:59.220 --> 26:08.100
We would still have longer than eight hour work days and 40 hour work weeks and children

26:08.100 --> 26:13.300
would still be working if it wasn't for the fact that we have legislation and third

26:13.300 --> 26:19.580
parties who have stepped in to put companies in line because greed is greed and it never

26:19.580 --> 26:26.260
goes away. Just just look at the history and I'm not going to go like on a big lesson

26:26.260 --> 26:28.420
here, but look at the history of unionization.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.620
Look at the history of labor in the US.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.180
I mean, just look at why we have freaking Labor Day.

26:35.740 --> 26:42.380
Yep. This is a problem that has been proven that if you if you leave something unchecked

26:42.380 --> 26:48.700
like that, it is going to continue to run rampant until it until someone's hurt or many

26:48.700 --> 26:52.220
someone's are hurt and then someone else has to check in.

26:53.580 --> 26:59.660
And I I do hope from all of this, we really start to get that talk of that video game

26:59.660 --> 27:05.260
union. And I hope that starts at Activision Blizzard King, because I do hope for my

27:05.260 --> 27:10.180
friends that work there, I hope I truly hope the organization can come out stronger at

27:10.180 --> 27:13.860
the end of this from employees having a seat at the table.

27:14.140 --> 27:18.460
And from what I understand, that's what many of them have been asking for in the first

27:18.460 --> 27:23.140
place. But obviously, Bobby Kotick being removed now is the first step in that

27:23.140 --> 27:29.540
happening. I would also like to say for our friends that are in that employment

27:29.540 --> 27:33.300
situation, don't be mad at the people who are boycotting.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.300
Be mad at the company you work for from putting them in that position.

27:37.060 --> 27:42.140
This is this is this is a problem we have with your senior management and that and I

27:42.140 --> 27:44.460
feel horrible for the people on the front lines.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.500
I really do. I really do.

27:46.900 --> 27:53.580
But this is something that they'll have to continue to address with with their HR to

27:53.580 --> 27:57.860
make. And I would say this, too, if you are dealing and this is for any job, by the way,

27:58.140 --> 28:03.620
if you are dealing with harassment of any variety at your work, document every last

28:03.700 --> 28:11.580
thing, not just having, you know, a printout of not a printout, but like, you know, oh,

28:11.580 --> 28:13.380
I went to HR on this day electronically.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.900
No, you print that shit out.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.420
You have a physical record of it.

28:18.340 --> 28:23.620
It just and it's sorry, it just scrolled along the bottom that there's a report about

28:23.620 --> 28:27.420
the guy at Activision Blizzard who signed all his emails, 1-800-ALLCOCK.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.900
Document that, PDF it.

28:31.460 --> 28:36.300
That's it took years for that person to get by, and that's just another just add it to

28:36.300 --> 28:38.100
the dumpster fire seriously.

28:39.460 --> 28:46.860
But but again, it is if you're remotely in a situation like that documented, it's going

28:46.860 --> 28:53.700
to come back and you your document could help other people and it surely should have

28:53.700 --> 28:56.740
been done with Activision for many more of the employees.

28:57.740 --> 29:01.700
I mean, retrospect, you know, hindsight, but I'm saying that.

29:03.020 --> 29:10.660
I'm glad to see what's coming out is coming out, but there needed to be something done

29:10.660 --> 29:15.980
way too long ago, and that's really what has me angrier than anything, even if I am

29:15.980 --> 29:18.860
not expressing things.

29:19.860 --> 29:28.500
Loudly or verbally, passionately, my emotions are still there, and I am just simply trying

29:28.500 --> 29:33.060
not to lose my shit because I am also angered.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.220
Someone needs to stay calm while I'm over here yelling, it's fine.

29:38.300 --> 29:41.420
I'm not I'm I'll put it this way, I'm not calm on the inside.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.100
Fair, completely fair.

29:43.700 --> 29:49.500
Um, Bobby Kotick's bonus, that CEO bonus, the board bonus, they need to redistribute

29:49.500 --> 29:51.380
that to the victims, the employees.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.540
That's my other big for the employees.

29:54.060 --> 29:58.180
Take that one hundred and fifty three million dollars and give it to the employees who've

29:58.180 --> 30:01.180
been making those games, who've been working their ass off through all this bullshit.

30:01.220 --> 30:05.380
It's just they should find him for back amounts.

30:06.220 --> 30:15.860
I also the other shining light in this, which is so weird to say, is don't forget this

30:15.860 --> 30:20.020
company is still under investigation by the state of California, and Bobby Kotick has

30:20.020 --> 30:20.780
been subpoenaed.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.900
I would love to see him locked up.

30:26.300 --> 30:30.900
I mean, he's a man, he's a man and he's rich, so it's not going to happen.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.100
Yeah, they're going to have an impossible time proving anything criminal.

30:35.060 --> 30:35.980
But I would.

30:37.460 --> 30:41.140
Well, especially in light of the verdict out of Wisconsin.

30:41.180 --> 30:44.420
Yes, I would love to see.

30:46.940 --> 30:51.180
I would love to see some justice in any sort of way at this point.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.820
Well, that we all know is going to go to higher.

30:56.420 --> 31:00.140
I just want him out of the gaming industry.

31:00.180 --> 31:01.620
I want I want him out here.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.380
I don't want him really going into another industry.

31:03.420 --> 31:07.740
I want him. I want him to be never heard from again.

31:09.460 --> 31:12.780
Yeah, all right, how about a nice bottomless pit somewhere?

31:12.900 --> 31:17.980
I, I have I think we have to be very careful and say that we're using a lot of hyperbole.

31:18.500 --> 31:23.940
Yes, we are. But I'm reminded of a Wendy Williams clip when she was talking about Ms.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.980
and Mr. Spears.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.900
I'm not going to repeat it because somebody will report it, even though it's hyperbole.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.540
But that we know it, that's where my brain is right now.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.940
How many times have we heard this in a certain mutual friend stream?

31:38.340 --> 31:43.820
Yeah. Oh, yeah. When it when it when it comes to their careers, that clip.

31:44.780 --> 31:51.220
Yes. Although, however, if he was on fire, I wouldn't offer any water.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.060
Quest Buster and I say that also is hyperbole.

31:55.540 --> 32:00.700
Quest Buster in chat says, as a weird side note, ATVI stock price has fallen

32:00.780 --> 32:05.860
30 percent since news of the investigation broke this summer, allowing Roblox to pass

32:05.860 --> 32:07.860
them in value a few days ago. Good.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.540
That's that's where it's going to hurt them the most.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.580
And if you're holding Activision Blizzard stock, I would encourage you to sell it.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.540
I even made a tweet earlier this week.

32:15.540 --> 32:20.820
I was like, we need a movement like what we had with the whole like GameStop and AMC

32:20.820 --> 32:25.820
thing where we we need to hit Activision Blizzard there and make sure the stock stock

32:25.820 --> 32:27.460
is being sold off in mass.

32:27.780 --> 32:32.860
I somebody had replied to me and said that's not but I think they kind of

32:33.100 --> 32:35.540
misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying we need to buy the stock.

32:35.540 --> 32:39.420
I'm saying we need to be pushing this narrative within the financial media and

32:39.420 --> 32:42.860
within the financial markets and making sure that this is giving coverage on

32:42.860 --> 32:46.740
financial media so that people sell their stock and unload it.

32:46.940 --> 32:50.540
And that's that's going to do the talking, unfortunately, at the end of the day.

32:50.740 --> 32:57.140
But I will say we need to have some sort of financial devaluation enacted.

32:57.700 --> 33:03.980
But I will say I was at the gas station getting way too expensive gas in my

33:03.980 --> 33:05.300
thankfully hybrid car.

33:06.140 --> 33:09.860
You know how the gas station plays those little TV things that show you the weather

33:09.860 --> 33:10.900
and headlines and stuff?

33:10.900 --> 33:14.420
Guess what? This was the headline they were talking about at the gas station.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.020
So, you know what?

33:17.020 --> 33:18.900
I usually just walk off and ignore those things.

33:19.260 --> 33:22.060
Well, I've seen I've seen they're pumping my gas starts.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.460
I have lots of gas.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.380
But gas has automatic things on them now.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.260
True, true. All right.

33:28.260 --> 33:37.180
Anyway. OK, I know anything else to add here, any other negativity palette or

33:37.180 --> 33:38.860
something? Well, no, we'll get to another story.

33:38.860 --> 33:40.420
We'll go to our gaming weeks and we're done here.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.940
But I just want to make sure we've talked about everything.

33:44.420 --> 33:49.660
Yes, pretty much the only thing I was going to mention also is the organization

33:49.660 --> 33:55.220
girls who code was partnered with Activision and obviously severed their ties

33:55.220 --> 33:56.940
because of all the crap that's going on.

33:56.940 --> 33:58.980
It's kind of hard to be partnered with a company like that.

33:58.980 --> 34:03.460
This time, you think you think under understand that call.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.260
Much love to girls who code.

34:05.260 --> 34:10.340
Much love to them. E3VL pointing out in chat, Call of Duty sales dropped 40 percent

34:10.340 --> 34:11.420
compared to last year.

34:11.660 --> 34:13.580
That's another game stocks.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.140
But that that's totally different.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.460
All right. All right. That's actually not different.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.020
It's what else is doing basically.

34:20.340 --> 34:21.940
But it shouldn't hurt the cause.

34:22.380 --> 34:25.060
Right. To have it be such a.

34:26.140 --> 34:32.340
Piece of shit. And remember, that was Bobby, that was Bobby Kotex call to pull

34:32.340 --> 34:36.020
all of the studios to work on that flop.

34:37.460 --> 34:40.260
Just food for thought, that was Bobby Kotex call.

34:41.260 --> 34:45.860
So if you all if you financial peeps are mad about that, guess who needs to go?

34:46.380 --> 34:51.340
By the way, there's a lot of other hideous shit he's been involved with that you should

34:51.340 --> 34:52.620
look at anyway. I'm done.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.300
I promise. Let's cleanse our palate.

34:54.460 --> 34:58.820
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and talk about some happy things like I'm sure Dark

34:58.820 --> 35:03.020
Sakura is going to talk about murder in video games, in video games.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.140
Yes, I did murder some people.

35:07.340 --> 35:11.500
I, of course, played Dead by Daylight because I stream it.

35:13.260 --> 35:17.780
I also at least patched my Animal Crossing.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.980
So I'm taking steps.

35:21.220 --> 35:26.180
And of course, Fantasian, I did like a little bit of a grindy grind, I actually had to

35:26.180 --> 35:32.380
start my my stream for it a little bit late, and so I just played around and did some

35:32.380 --> 35:34.100
quests and some stuff like that.

35:36.380 --> 35:44.860
But I'm I'm having thoughts about the state of Dead by Daylight, and it's kind of not

35:44.860 --> 35:49.100
quite what I think some of the other streamers are saying, because there's a lot of

35:49.100 --> 35:52.420
stuff that they're saying about it, kind of ad nauseam.

35:53.980 --> 36:01.020
And I am now at the point where I'm just like, if a game is going, you know, if if

36:01.020 --> 36:05.300
people are going to be shit, if MMR is going to be shit, if all of this is just going to

36:05.300 --> 36:08.580
be the ultimate in garbage, then fuck it, I'll meme.

36:08.580 --> 36:14.980
Let my MMR get low, let me start winning some more games, then have it get shitty again,

36:14.980 --> 36:16.340
and then I'll meme some more.

36:17.460 --> 36:21.780
At this point, I'm kind of done with the complaining about it.

36:22.780 --> 36:31.940
I want I want Karina to come out already, I want my artist who has an amazing backstory

36:31.940 --> 36:35.580
and an amazing level and is an amazing character designed to boot.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.580
I'm so excited.

36:37.860 --> 36:42.060
Also, dear Hawkins Laboratory, rest in fucking hell.

36:45.700 --> 36:50.060
That's right, that the map was finally removed this week, as the Stranger Things

36:50.060 --> 36:54.180
characters no longer purchasable in the store, they are they're gone.

36:54.180 --> 36:57.820
And although you can still play them a game if you if you had them from before, there's

36:57.820 --> 37:05.340
more to it, because their perks are now generic, you can no longer adept challenge

37:05.340 --> 37:08.100
them, which means I won't see any more fucking adept Steves.

37:08.980 --> 37:09.940
I didn't realize that.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.900
Well, that's sad, because I never got those achievements.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.700
But well, the achievements don't exist.

37:14.460 --> 37:17.220
Oh, they are gone, removed for everybody.

37:17.220 --> 37:20.420
Oh, wow. OK, so you're off the hook, Rob.

37:21.020 --> 37:25.340
I didn't is that I mean, I'm sure that's true on like Steam and the PC places.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.740
Is that true on Microsoft?

37:27.180 --> 37:35.020
And that should be true everywhere, because I think it wasn't I think it was was a hydro

37:35.020 --> 37:37.260
that was doing adept challenges the other day.

37:37.580 --> 37:41.140
Oh, he does a lot of either hydro or merit or Meru love hydro.

37:41.140 --> 37:43.500
Shout out to hydro. Yeah, hydro is awesome.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.780
But it was either hydro or Meru, because those are the two people that I usually will

37:46.780 --> 37:50.740
watch earlier in the day and went to go look.

37:50.740 --> 37:55.220
And the the achievements for them were gone.

37:55.220 --> 38:03.380
And indeed, I think if I go and look at my because I have a Stadia achievement thing on

38:03.380 --> 38:04.660
here. Right, right.

38:05.020 --> 38:09.180
And I am looking at my adept list for survivors.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.980
And I I don't see them on the adept list at all.

38:13.980 --> 38:16.460
I'm actually going to resort my list in alphabetical order.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.180
Bobby Blackwolf and chat says, I wonder if you lose gamerscore when they delete

38:20.180 --> 38:22.780
achievements. That's why I'm fascinated with this concept.

38:22.780 --> 38:26.540
I I'm not familiar with games deleting achievements.

38:26.540 --> 38:31.580
I I would think that maybe the people who earned them probably keep them, even if they

38:31.580 --> 38:36.260
don't show, they might be in a hidden category, but they probably just don't show up as

38:36.260 --> 38:39.980
achievable for new people. But even then, that's also kind of fascinating to me in a way.

38:40.660 --> 38:46.180
Well, OK, so I looked it over and yeah, they are completely off of the list.

38:46.180 --> 38:50.100
There is no more adept for them at all, even on Stadia's readouts.

38:50.300 --> 38:53.220
Interesting. OK, that's fascinating to me.

38:53.860 --> 38:56.740
I also thought I got adept trapper.

38:56.860 --> 38:57.940
I'm sad that I didn't.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.700
Oh, well, I was like, why isn't that on my unlock list?

39:01.700 --> 39:02.780
Oh, I must not have gotten it.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.420
All right. Anything else for you?

39:07.460 --> 39:15.980
I guess that when I do my my mental breakdown streaming, which will be every day while I'm

39:15.980 --> 39:20.660
on medical leave, except for when I do my labs and I'll talk a little bit about that.

39:23.220 --> 39:27.100
I maybe might try to do adept challenges for killers.

39:27.940 --> 39:32.060
And my mental breakdown will be televised.

39:33.340 --> 39:37.700
Just if you need to step away, please step away, you know, do what you need to do, take

39:37.700 --> 39:38.700
care of Jamie first.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.220
I think it's going to be hilarious because when I'm not on my meds, I'm either super

39:43.220 --> 39:47.780
funny or I'm so pathetic that I'm super funny to bullies.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.420
Oh, boy. All right.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.300
Just don't want to see you.

39:51.860 --> 39:54.300
I'm trying to have a good sense of humor about it.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.580
And that's good, but I just don't want to see you broadcast something you will wish you

39:58.580 --> 39:59.380
had later on.

39:59.740 --> 40:00.700
I'll I'll know better.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.780
Yeah, good. All right.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.220
Let's head over to Loki.

40:04.820 --> 40:05.940
How was your gaming week, Loki?

40:06.580 --> 40:07.500
It's all Minecraft.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.860
It's always Minecraft.

40:10.780 --> 40:14.740
This week, though, I did put out a new video, so that was pretty good.

40:14.820 --> 40:21.940
I got more done on my base and then the it's not covered in this week, so I'll go ahead

40:21.940 --> 40:27.700
and say it. Then the news came out that the the next update for Minecraft 118 is coming

40:27.700 --> 40:28.580
out on the 30th.

40:29.300 --> 40:34.060
And so that screwed up all my timetables because I thought, oh, I've got like four more

40:34.060 --> 40:37.460
weeks. And I was planning on doing like some really elaborate things.

40:37.460 --> 40:46.860
And it's like. Damn it, by the way, which is fine, because what I wanted to do probably

40:46.860 --> 40:51.860
once again, overscoping the idea, I want to get into animation as well.

40:51.860 --> 40:57.180
But I think it would take in too long and it would just be very hard to do.

40:57.220 --> 41:01.700
It would've been cool. But the new the new plans now are better.

41:01.700 --> 41:08.220
And it's kind of exciting going into the next season and being able to hang out with the

41:08.220 --> 41:13.820
people on the server this weekend and actually have voice chats with people like that's

41:13.820 --> 41:17.300
just something that I thought I would be doing on my current server.

41:17.300 --> 41:22.540
But now it's kind of fun and then also pissing off somebody because I built a shop on

41:22.540 --> 41:23.380
top of their pumpkin.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.300
But, you know, Minecraft drama.

41:28.300 --> 41:33.740
So, yeah, I'm just going to be finishing up stuff this week and finishing up the build

41:33.740 --> 41:38.860
for that. Also starting planning for next season as well and just kind of.

41:40.100 --> 41:43.500
You know, diving right into that once we get started, I think it's probably going to be a

41:43.500 --> 41:47.220
couple of weeks. Well, whenever the server version is available.

41:47.220 --> 41:48.500
So usually about the week after.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.460
So hopefully it'll be starting a new season in like two weeks.

41:52.580 --> 41:55.780
Awesome. Yeah, look forward to more videos.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.340
Good luck to you. Hope the new server works out well.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.540
I know. I know getting discovered is always the challenge.

42:01.700 --> 42:06.820
It's one we've been facing here at OLR for a long time, but I hope I hope you get it.

42:06.820 --> 42:08.420
I hope you get that spark that breaks through.

42:08.420 --> 42:14.500
I really do. So my gaming week, I guess I'll follow up to the Dead by Daylight talk.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.780
I've also been playing a little bit.

42:15.780 --> 42:20.260
I've been kind of getting back into killer, oddly enough, even though I don't love getting

42:20.260 --> 42:22.260
bullied sometimes because I'm not great at killer.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.700
I think I think, Jamie, I've reached a similar conclusion, a different way.

42:25.700 --> 42:29.100
I'm just kind of in that point where I'm like, I don't care if I lose, like if I lose.

42:29.100 --> 42:34.020
So what? Like the only person that knows is me and maybe the people that bullied me, but

42:34.020 --> 42:35.980
it's whatever. They'll just go on to the next match.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.340
I stopped considering it as losing.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.700
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.780
That's true. It's just a game.

42:41.780 --> 42:46.900
You know, it's if you had fun, then you won.

42:47.220 --> 42:49.980
And if you bring no edge, you'll almost always at least get one kill.

42:50.980 --> 42:55.700
But and if you bring no ed and people bitch about it, you can then go, oh, how dare I use

42:55.700 --> 42:59.060
a perk that was programmed into the game intended to be used by the developers.

42:59.140 --> 43:02.820
Bring Soul Guard. Cleanse your damn totems.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.500
Yeah. Easy asses.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.420
I will. No, you're fine.

43:06.420 --> 43:09.740
But funny enough, the killer that I'm like super into right now, I actually don't have

43:09.740 --> 43:11.500
no ed on. It just hasn't come up in the roulette web.

43:11.860 --> 43:15.300
I am super fond of Pinhead right now is like the killer.

43:15.300 --> 43:20.940
I really enjoy playing like I yes, I find the chain mechanic and all that stuff extremely

43:20.940 --> 43:25.740
satisfying. I love that when they go do the box, if you aren't chasing anyone else, you

43:25.740 --> 43:28.700
get like a free teleport right to smash the survivor.

43:29.420 --> 43:30.780
There's a lot about it.

43:30.940 --> 43:36.900
And like when people fuck up Pinhead's mechanic, the entire match snowballs for them.

43:36.900 --> 43:41.500
And I had a match like that last night where it was like nobody bothered to open the box

43:41.860 --> 43:43.420
I found the box is Pinhead.

43:43.420 --> 43:47.700
So basically when you're playing for those who don't know Dead by Daylight, when when the

43:47.700 --> 43:53.060
survivors are doing the thing, yeah, you have to you have about 60 seconds every so often

43:53.220 --> 43:55.180
to solve the lament configuration.

43:55.180 --> 43:56.500
And this is a thing out of the movies.

43:56.620 --> 44:00.580
And if you don't solve it, basically chains start showing up everywhere.

44:00.580 --> 44:04.020
And not only do they slow you down, but now the killer can see the chains.

44:04.180 --> 44:07.860
So I as the killer know where you are because I hear the chains go off.

44:08.180 --> 44:14.260
And then even to make that even worse, if you don't solve the box in 60 seconds, if I find it

44:14.260 --> 44:20.260
first and I as Pinhead solved the lament configuration, then all of you scream, I

44:20.260 --> 44:24.940
instantly know where you all are located and you go right into the chain phase for at least 30

44:24.940 --> 44:26.500
seconds until a new box spawns.

44:27.220 --> 44:29.900
I as Pinhead cannot see where the box spawns.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.980
I have to come across it.

44:30.980 --> 44:35.620
Normally the survivors, they can all see it and let there is an add on that makes it a lot

44:35.620 --> 44:36.500
harder to find.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.980
But I don't run that out on because it doesn't pop up very often for me.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.980
But yeah, I love I don't know.

44:40.980 --> 44:41.940
I'm like super into Pinhead.

44:41.940 --> 44:42.500
It's weird.

44:42.500 --> 44:47.300
So and I when somebody drops a palette, I love like because the other big mechanic is that you

44:47.300 --> 44:50.900
can like you basically separate from your body to throw a chain.

44:51.060 --> 44:55.140
So you do this thing where you like project out where you want the chain to start and then the

44:55.140 --> 44:59.740
camera flips to where the chain is and you can drive the chain hopefully into selfies.

45:00.100 --> 45:01.060
Do you do hook selfies?

45:01.220 --> 45:02.580
I do palette selfies.

45:02.580 --> 45:04.780
When somebody throws a palette down, I'm waiting there.

45:04.780 --> 45:07.980
I'm I start with the hook and I'm waiting there to release the button.

45:08.100 --> 45:11.380
And then when they drop the palette, release, chain them right on the other side of the palette.

45:11.900 --> 45:14.100
But I mean, where you take the screenshot.

45:15.460 --> 45:17.100
Oh, no, I don't do the screenshot.

45:17.100 --> 45:18.060
No, no, no, that's clever.

45:18.060 --> 45:24.340
Yeah, if you can stand next to the hook and then you throw the chain and it turns the camera

45:24.340 --> 45:33.660
around and which is really funky because when you play as a killer and there are two boundary

45:33.660 --> 45:38.660
breaks, by the way, and I'm glad one of them showed what it looks like when you play killer and

45:38.660 --> 45:43.660
you go into like a third person perspective when you should be in your first person's perspective.

45:43.860 --> 45:47.020
And it shows how like their body is skewed, you know, a certain way.

45:47.220 --> 45:55.100
I think it's funny that it readjusts to the way a survivor sees it when you when you do that.

45:55.180 --> 45:56.460
I mean, I guess it kind of has to.

45:56.460 --> 45:58.500
But I think it's interesting just how quickly it happens.

45:58.660 --> 46:02.220
It is, you know, I love like behind the scenes stuff like that.

46:02.660 --> 46:05.700
Real quick update on the achievement front in our chat.

46:05.700 --> 46:06.980
Bobby Black Wolf is in chat.

46:06.980 --> 46:11.980
The good Bobby, who says, OK, yeah, it looks like they didn't delete the achievements.

46:11.980 --> 46:12.860
This is on Xbox.

46:12.860 --> 46:14.340
He's just did the research there.

46:14.340 --> 46:14.820
He didn't research.

46:15.180 --> 46:20.740
They didn't delete the achievements more than they renamed them and gave them different unlock criteria.

46:20.780 --> 46:21.860
So that's kind of interesting.

46:21.860 --> 46:27.140
So they probably, instead of making it Adept Steve, probably made it get out with these three perks.

46:27.140 --> 46:29.380
And it's just some whatever.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.580
Bobby says Steve did the rename too.

46:32.340 --> 46:38.540
That's interesting, because I thought I mean, there are already challenges to get out with certain.

46:38.540 --> 46:43.900
I mean, I guess that is the way to redo the Adept, but it's not you could do that with any character now.

46:44.140 --> 46:44.580
Interesting.

46:44.580 --> 46:53.860
So Bobby Black Wolf says the achievement so alone, which I am assuming is the Steve Adept, because that sounds like him, is now Operation Survival in a public match repair.

46:53.980 --> 46:55.540
Oh, no, that's in a public match.

46:55.540 --> 46:58.740
Repair the generator in the treatment theaters, operation theater and escape.

46:58.740 --> 47:02.380
Oh, that's oh, but that's probably that was probably the Hawkins achievement before.

47:02.380 --> 47:03.540
And they moved it to Larry's.

47:03.540 --> 47:04.780
That's probably what that one is.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.980
That actually makes sense.

47:05.980 --> 47:08.620
That makes a lot of areas because they're sort of the same kind of.

47:08.620 --> 47:10.340
Yeah, they're very similar map being indoors.

47:10.340 --> 47:11.420
Yes. Interesting.

47:11.820 --> 47:12.900
OK, moving on.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.900
I have other games to talk about, so I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.

47:17.340 --> 47:21.580
That expansion should have been out by now, but it was delayed and that's OK.

47:21.900 --> 47:24.500
I don't remember if I mentioned on the show, but I got all my jobs.

47:24.500 --> 47:26.620
I hit that goal of getting everything to 80.

47:26.820 --> 47:28.340
So I'm ready for the expansion.

47:28.340 --> 47:37.900
Now I'm just doing Moogle tome runs and trying to get more mounts and just upping my collection, getting ready for Endwalker, which early access is December 3rd.

47:37.900 --> 47:39.460
I'm very excited about that.

47:39.460 --> 47:45.660
So, yeah, I was playing a little more Forza Horizon five, which is still a great game.

47:45.820 --> 47:47.620
I was playing that a little bit earlier in the week.

47:48.060 --> 47:54.100
And then later this week, on Friday, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were released.

47:54.740 --> 48:00.420
And I picked up Brilliant Diamond, which seems to be the one a lot of people are getting in retrospect, looking at my friends list.

48:00.420 --> 48:04.980
I wish I'd got Shining Pearl, but there's more Pokemon I like and diamond.

48:05.180 --> 48:07.780
So I've been playing that.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.860
And yeah, I'm already through the second gym.

48:10.860 --> 48:16.020
I say already, like some of you guys have probably already beaten the game, but for me, that's good progress.

48:16.340 --> 48:18.180
And I'm just enjoying playing Pokemon.

48:18.380 --> 48:20.420
I love the quality of life stuff.

48:20.420 --> 48:22.420
I know some of the purists can't stand it.

48:23.180 --> 48:24.740
Respectfully, you're wrong.

48:24.900 --> 48:32.820
These are great changes, for example, the experience share being there and on by default from the very beginning without it being explained.

48:32.940 --> 48:33.740
Fantastic.

48:33.740 --> 48:37.220
Love that experience share is such an important part of Pokemon.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.300
I don't understand.

48:38.660 --> 48:44.900
Yeah, I think you're just living in the dark ages or you just clamor for an old game from the mid 90s if you're still tied to that.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.020
So I love that that's there by default.

48:47.500 --> 48:52.020
The changes that they did to the underground to make more Pokemon available sooner are pretty cool.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.900
And yeah, I'm just I'm just enjoying playing the game.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.900
I'm having a good time with a Pokemon game.

48:57.620 --> 49:02.580
Mike Defton chat says, I'm stuck at the beginning, shining, shiny hunting for a starter.

49:02.860 --> 49:04.260
Well, that's that's you.

49:04.260 --> 49:11.700
Shane was doing a similar thing, I think, but he gave up that intro sequence before you get the starter.

49:11.820 --> 49:13.300
That takes a while.

49:13.460 --> 49:16.220
Like you don't just start the game and get a starter.

49:16.420 --> 49:20.180
You have to kind of go through the town you started and then go up the trail.

49:20.420 --> 49:22.100
It takes a minute to get there.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.940
So I can see how resetting is a pain in the ass.

49:25.820 --> 49:33.660
E3VL points out if you have Let's Go and Sword and Shield, if you have those save files on the switch, you can get Mew and Jirachi.

49:33.660 --> 49:34.500
That is true.

49:34.700 --> 49:36.860
You don't see them until you get to the flower town.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.540
But there's an old man and an old woman in the flower town.

49:39.540 --> 49:42.780
And the old man will give you Jirachi for having Sword and Shield.

49:42.940 --> 49:45.580
And the old woman will give you Mew for having Let's Go.

49:45.580 --> 49:46.700
I have them both.

49:46.820 --> 49:52.340
And Jirachi, at least as of right now, is on my team because I enjoy enjoy that one.

49:52.340 --> 49:56.340
So, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.

49:56.340 --> 49:57.340
I don't know what else to say.

49:57.340 --> 49:58.820
It's a Pokemon game. It's fun.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.260
I'm enjoying it. We'll see.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.060
We'll see if I stick with it all the way to the end.

50:02.060 --> 50:10.740
I have a weird feeling it'll probably take me a year to beat it just because when Final Fantasy 14 expansion comes out, everything else is on hold.

50:10.740 --> 50:15.860
And you are not going to hear me talk about anything else for at least four weeks or until I get to the end of the story.

50:15.860 --> 50:16.660
It is what it is.

50:16.780 --> 50:17.740
We all have our thing.

50:17.740 --> 50:18.500
That is my thing.

50:18.780 --> 50:20.260
Dark Sakura's got Dead by Daylight.

50:20.260 --> 50:21.180
Loki's got Minecraft.

50:21.180 --> 50:22.260
I got Final Fantasy 14.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.660
OK, I should get back into playing.

50:25.100 --> 50:25.900
You should. It's fine.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.380
I'm sure the expansion is going to be great.

50:27.380 --> 50:27.980
I'm paying for it.

50:28.700 --> 50:29.300
Oh, yeah.

50:30.300 --> 50:40.140
All right, let's get into some more gaming news and we'll start with an update to the big headline from last week, right, Loki?

50:40.500 --> 50:45.260
Yeah, so the Grand Theft Auto trilogy Definitive Edition is a pile of garbage.

50:45.260 --> 50:47.380
Yeah, that's that's still a thing.

50:47.380 --> 50:53.300
And I don't I don't know what to make of this.

50:53.700 --> 50:54.700
It's just stupid.

50:55.340 --> 51:15.340
So apparently they put Rockstar Games put out a post on a Rockstar news wire, whatever, saying that, hey, we are aware of the issues and, you know, there is a title update that's going on right now and it'll fix a number of the issues.

51:15.740 --> 51:27.260
And in the meantime, we're going to put up the older classic versions of Grand Theft Auto three Vice City in San Andreas that are those are going to be available to purchase.

51:27.980 --> 51:36.340
And then also for anybody who purchased the definitive edition will also get those from the store.

51:36.340 --> 51:41.220
I guess they'll receive those until, I guess, June 30th, 2022.

51:41.980 --> 51:47.300
So if you purchase the definitive edition between them, you'll get that classic version at no additional cost.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.140
Oh, how generous of you.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.180
Thank you.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.700
Then, of course, they said that, you know.

51:54.940 --> 52:05.100
The update versions, updated versions of these classic games did not launch in the state that meets our own standards of quality or the standards our fans have come to expect.

52:05.340 --> 52:06.700
Excuse me.

52:07.260 --> 52:07.900
Excuse me.

52:07.900 --> 52:21.540
You're a company that develops very complicated, well polished games, and you were unaware of the quality or you didn't believe that they met your standards.

52:21.540 --> 52:22.300
Well, guess what?

52:22.300 --> 52:28.020
You as a company or publisher can say, yeah, that doesn't meet our standards.

52:28.100 --> 52:30.460
We're not publishing that right now.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.580
We're going to delay it, let it go.

52:32.780 --> 52:36.420
But you made the decision to release it in the state that it was.

52:36.540 --> 52:42.060
So this either tells me you're complete fucking stupid or you just don't fucking care.

52:42.420 --> 52:43.460
Take either one.

52:43.460 --> 52:44.340
It doesn't matter.

52:44.340 --> 52:44.860
They don't.

52:45.700 --> 52:47.260
It's just it's garbage.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.620
This is ridiculous that, oh, it wasn't up to our standards.

52:53.500 --> 52:54.660
Well, no kidding.

52:54.820 --> 53:00.340
I mean, you obviously somebody had to have been playing it or getting updates.

53:00.340 --> 53:02.860
You weren't completely going into this blind like, what?

53:03.780 --> 53:07.100
It was looking like that and we just let it go out.

53:08.820 --> 53:11.700
I don't believe that for one minute.

53:11.740 --> 53:21.380
I also I bet the QA department, I bet the quality because there's going to be people out there that still don't get it and they're going to sit there and say, doesn't don't they have a quality assurance department?

53:21.860 --> 53:22.940
Aren't they doing their jobs?

53:22.940 --> 53:25.100
And yes, they do.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.020
And they are.

53:26.020 --> 53:27.020
But guess what?

53:27.020 --> 53:31.740
Sometimes you report those things to the top and they go, ah, we have a minimum viable product.

53:31.740 --> 53:33.140
We'll release it and patch it later.

53:33.300 --> 53:36.380
That is the decision of the senior and that folks.

53:36.380 --> 53:36.660
Yeah.

53:36.660 --> 53:40.580
And that is not the way to release stuff nowadays.

53:40.580 --> 53:45.820
I know it seems like, oh, well, we've got a shoddy shell of a game put out through a patch it later.

53:46.420 --> 53:50.220
OK, well, we're going to remember that when the next game comes out.

53:51.420 --> 53:56.660
And of course, there's still the lawsuits that they're filing against modders for different things.

53:57.540 --> 54:09.700
So I know right now that there are they're fighting the lawsuits right now for RE3 and RE Vice City, which were reverse engineered clean room source code.

54:09.700 --> 54:14.860
So it was basically kind of seeing how the game works and figuring it out in the back end and redoing it.

54:14.860 --> 54:30.460
And so basically saying that, you know, any complained copying of code protected material that did occur, if any, was undertaken to allow for interoperability of the software and fixing bugs.

54:32.660 --> 54:41.020
But such actions comprising reverse engineering are transformative use is what they're alleging, which I agree.

54:41.020 --> 54:48.660
I think if they are coming up with completely unique code that basically runs the game in a similar manner.

54:49.860 --> 54:56.900
Then there's not really much they can do about it unless they were actually ripping out the code from the game and popping it into theirs.

54:56.900 --> 54:59.380
I mean, it. I don't know.

55:00.300 --> 55:00.900
It's stupid.

55:01.060 --> 55:08.380
As 100 Mountain Chat says, this was a side project that didn't have a huge staff, I imagine that was pushed out to get out something for the holidays.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.460
Again, a call from the top.

55:10.460 --> 55:16.140
And why are we so I mean, they don't have something for the holidays because they have granted auto online.

55:16.140 --> 55:16.820
They have grants.

55:16.820 --> 55:18.020
They're making tons of money from that.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.340
They don't need to push this out.

55:19.340 --> 55:23.060
How much money does this obviously that does this possibly make for them?

55:23.100 --> 55:30.260
Didn't Switch show us that the holidays do not have to be the end all be all of video game releases?

55:30.260 --> 55:31.180
I mean, I get it.

55:31.180 --> 55:32.900
Yes, there is a lot of retail.

55:33.220 --> 55:34.860
But OK, you know what?

55:34.860 --> 55:36.820
Covid has fucked everything up.

55:36.820 --> 55:38.900
If you have to delay it for a few months.

55:39.180 --> 55:40.220
Oh, well.

55:40.220 --> 55:41.580
Release it in April.

55:41.580 --> 55:45.460
And I bet there'll be a lot of people who'd still buy it if the product is good.

55:45.940 --> 55:51.940
I just feel like it's mind blowing to me how people literally die on the hill of getting the game out for the holiday.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.700
I know y'all are going to go to fiscal year.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.900
Got to get the stocks.

55:56.900 --> 55:58.940
Has to be out before April or doesn't go to.

55:59.220 --> 56:00.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.460
But do you think this helped?

56:02.700 --> 56:05.780
Do you think this is going to end up being a good thing for them at the end of the day?

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
Well, this is not.

56:07.260 --> 56:16.140
It's like, look at they knew what the the studio, the quality of the studio, they had this studio do mobile versions of these games.

56:16.140 --> 56:23.220
And then they they instead of remastering the console versions for this definitive edition,

56:23.500 --> 56:29.300
they remastered the mobile versions, which were like adapted from the console version.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.020
So it's like a copy of a copy.

56:31.660 --> 56:34.620
You can't tell me that they didn't know that they had issues with it.

56:34.620 --> 56:41.100
I mean, like, just can you not like I'm going to put the original game on one screen.

56:41.100 --> 56:47.140
I'm going to put the piece of shit that I'm working on right now and I'm going to look at them and go, damn, that doesn't look good.

56:47.260 --> 56:48.540
Maybe I should fix that.

56:48.620 --> 56:50.220
Oh, someone looked at it.

56:50.220 --> 56:51.580
Loki, someone looked at it.

56:51.580 --> 56:53.140
It's just somebody else didn't care.

56:53.140 --> 56:58.500
Stupid like like the rain textures that they had were like super high res for what it is like.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.700
It shouldn't be that high level.

57:01.340 --> 57:04.620
The texture file for that shouldn't be that big.

57:04.940 --> 57:07.660
And they were using something ridiculously large.

57:07.660 --> 57:11.460
I mean, even the rain, just like the opacity just need to be fixed on that.

57:11.500 --> 57:14.900
I heard modders are actually taking care of that stuff.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.740
I mean, it's just of course.

57:16.740 --> 57:17.620
And it's weird, too.

57:17.620 --> 57:23.380
It's like even and even with this, like the San Andreas rain looks like garbage.

57:23.380 --> 57:25.380
And I think freeze rain looks like garbage.

57:25.380 --> 57:27.780
But Vice City, not so bad.

57:28.540 --> 57:32.820
Like, there's not even consistency between the different games that they have.

57:33.180 --> 57:36.140
And you can't tell me it's because they're running on different engines because they're not.

57:36.140 --> 57:37.780
They're all basically the same.

57:37.780 --> 57:42.700
It's just if these are like graphical assets, it shouldn't matter

57:43.380 --> 57:48.820
how, you know, they can just adjust the texture file that's being used for this.

57:48.820 --> 57:51.100
I don't. I don't know.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.100
It's just so stupid.

57:53.100 --> 57:55.020
They're like, I don't want to.

57:55.020 --> 57:56.460
And that's it. That's why.

57:56.780 --> 57:58.540
It's just it's low effort.

57:58.540 --> 58:01.620
It was an incredibly low effort port.

58:02.620 --> 58:06.660
Of another port that they put in there, it's because that's what they do.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.700
They're not going they're not going to.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.580
I don't even know why put this out, like why?

58:11.580 --> 58:13.740
Why even bother putting this out at this point?

58:13.740 --> 58:14.660
Like, I don't understand.

58:14.660 --> 58:17.700
Just put it put a sale out for your other games or something.

58:18.140 --> 58:21.220
Like, I don't know why you need the definitive edition of this,

58:21.500 --> 58:25.220
which is kind of where they ended up now is that they are doing a sale

58:25.260 --> 58:27.500
on those original games or they put the original games back

58:27.500 --> 58:30.020
after taking them down, right? Right.

58:30.060 --> 58:33.380
Yeah, it just got I don't know. It's stupid.

58:35.060 --> 58:38.020
It's because they thought they could print money.

58:38.020 --> 58:40.220
And it backfired.

58:40.980 --> 58:43.780
All right. Let's move on and talk about

58:43.780 --> 58:47.020
this is pretty big news in the competitive fighting game circuit,

58:47.020 --> 58:49.980
and that is, you know, of course, Nintendo has shut down a lot of,

58:50.340 --> 58:53.540
you know, Smash Brothers tournaments because they were running on that

58:53.780 --> 58:55.740
modded thing and so forth.

58:55.740 --> 58:59.060
Well, very interesting development this week in a tweet from

58:59.660 --> 59:02.380
a group of folks that organize tournaments.

59:02.380 --> 59:06.500
Panda, who is at Panda Global on Twitter, tweeted out,

59:06.500 --> 59:11.340
We are proud to announce our partnership with Nintendo in 2022.

59:11.340 --> 59:14.460
Panda will be bringing the first officially licensed circuit

59:14.740 --> 59:18.900
for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and Super Smash Brothers Melee

59:19.220 --> 59:20.700
to North America.

59:20.700 --> 59:24.940
That's the part that has a lot of people raising their eyebrows because

59:25.620 --> 59:28.260
they've they they tagged Nintendo in the tweet.

59:28.540 --> 59:32.140
They've they've given Nintendo coin or something's happened here.

59:32.420 --> 59:36.740
And Nintendo is essentially endorsing Super Smash Brothers Melee

59:36.980 --> 59:40.900
as a competitive platform, even though the ultimate is up there as well.

59:41.100 --> 59:45.020
It feels like Nintendo was resisting that for a long time.

59:45.220 --> 59:48.460
I don't know if this is because Ultimate is now finished.

59:48.460 --> 59:51.500
I'm using my quotey fingers finished because all the DLC

59:51.740 --> 59:54.060
is out there at this point or what the deal is.

59:54.380 --> 59:57.500
But very fascinating, to be quite honest.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:02.020
They did point out more details for this short series of events.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:06.620
I'm not sure what they mean by that with cash prizes is coming very soon.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.940
So that's that's pretty awesome.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.980
Hmm. Yeah, just maybe they wanted the new games showcase,

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.220
and so they agreed to do the new game and the old game as well.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.260
Yeah, which I would have which I would have figured would have been part of it.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.740
And Mike Defton chat says this is actually huge, like so freaking huge.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.180
Yes. But if you're in that fighting game circuit, I have seen people

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.460
who do play Smash and on a somewhat competitive level that are like kind

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.700
of tweeting like like, whoa, at this type of news that's going on.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.940
This is a big deal.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.540
The fact that you're going to have an official Nintendo Smash

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.780
Brothers Melee tournament in the year, assumably 2022.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.500
You know what, 20 years almost after almost 20 years after it was released.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.780
That is a pretty big deal.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.100
And especially after Nintendo, you know, was shut, shutting down modders

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.460
and really kind of was perceived to anyway

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.700
really be burying melee in favor of ultimate.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.140
So this is this is very, very interesting.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.580
That is very specifically on their terms.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.700
And that that honestly could be it as well.

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.300
And maybe Nintendo, to some expect, kind of realizes

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.420
they have to do this because they can't exactly stop the modders.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.220
But if they can get a company to partner with that's willing to do cash prizes

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.340
for this, then this is the one people are going to work for.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.860
And I think that's also a big thing.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.700
If you're going to get a cash prize from being the best in a melee

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.060
version of this, it's in one that's Nintendo acknowledged.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.180
Nonetheless, it's going to make it more attractive

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.500
to train to and compete to.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.620
I'm not saying it's going to do away with mods.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.340
You'll never you'll never do away with mods.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.340
And there's always going to be a fan, you know, fans for that scene

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.220
and all that stuff.

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.780
But it's going to mod. Yeah.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.100
But I think it's going to they're going to pull people away from that

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.940
in this more, quote unquote, legit thing, which I think is interesting.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:02.020
SSG 100 map saying Nintendo was hesitant to get into the tournament scene.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.980
They were shutting down a ton of tournaments until recent years.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.780
Even now, they only mildly tolerated tournaments.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.740
Now they're actually partnering with a legit e-sports group

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.980
to put something out.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.060
Mike Deaf follows that up and says, yeah, Hungrybox actually got emotional

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.820
about this. Well, this is, you know,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:22.060
if this is something that's been like underground for a long time

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.940
and have it's it's nice for Nintendo to kind of fucking acknowledge it.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.820
So kudos to everybody that that everybody that stood by

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.780
that 20 year old game while everybody was saying, why are you just

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.380
why are you playing such a goddamn old game?

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.500
Get over it. Play the new shit.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.260
For those of you guys out there that stuck with it, congratulations.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.260
You know, you're proud of yourself.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.540
You're getting a hug this week.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.900
And I to some extent, I get it like the modded thing.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.100
I kind of always understood why Nintendo shut that down.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.300
You may not like it,

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.860
but Nintendo completely was in the legal right to shut that down.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.460
The unmodded like local game store tournaments on melee.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.900
Like what's what's the problem, Nintendo?

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.980
What's the problem if it bothered if it bothered you that much?

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.180
Sell copies of melee, which, by the way,

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:18.020
a lot of people are thinking this might lead to that is that.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:21.340
Oh, now that Smash Brothers Ultimate is done

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.060
and there's this whole audience that wants to do melee

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:28.660
and do it competitively, let's sell them the game again on the switch.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.780
That doesn't actually sound far off.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:36.340
I. I holiday 2022.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.740
What do you bet? Now the game on the switch or sell them

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.380
a subscription to Nintendo online services is going to include that game in there.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.860
No, no, they're not going to.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.100
No, no, no. They won't Netflix the GameCube games.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.780
They're going to sell them separately.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.740
But you know what?

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:56.900
If this opens the door, the pop, if this opens the door to F-Zero GX

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.220
being also one of those games that comes out on a GameCube thing,

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.900
I'm going to allow it.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.500
That's the reality. All right.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.300
Pod culture and chat says melee ultimate remastered.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.660
See, I think the community would reject that immediately

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.820
if if it is not frame by frame.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.140
Perfect to the original.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.220
The community will reject it.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.620
The definitive edition.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.820
Yeah. Now I change how it plays ready to work on another game.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:31.460
Yeah. Vicarious visions before they were purchased by an evil company.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.660
Did what was considered to be a pretty relatively good remaster

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.900
where you just hit a button to toggle between the two.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.220
If that's the direction Nintendo wants to go with it. Cool.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.620
But yeah, it's.

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.620
All right. Let's move on to our soccer.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.580
How about more rumors?

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.180
We love rumors on Thanksgiving week when the news is slower.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.660
Well, CD Projekt,

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.740
there was like a little bit of a leak out there

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.180
that had a trailer.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.820
It was actually included in a trailer for Cyberpunk 2077

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:14.180
that there would be links to using Xbox Game Pass

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.700
and it would be available via the game pass.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.020
And they're like, nope, we didn't do that.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.380
That's a rumor. Stop.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:25.140
And that actually direct quote says there are no game pass plans

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.260
for Cyberpunk 2077.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:33.820
But it was there, you know, there was the mention.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:35.340
It makes me think that at some point

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.660
they actually did have some sort of discussion about it.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:44.860
The DLC delays are also not coming out.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.460
Well, sorry, the DLC is for this year has been delayed until next year.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.740
The new titles that are coming out for

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.580
Xbox Game Pass will actually just for this month is Grand Theft Auto

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.180
San Andreas, the Definitive Edition.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.060
It takes two Forza Horizon five and Evil Genius two.

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.500
Nice. Yeah.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.540
I'd grab Cyberpunk if it came out on Game Pass.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.700
I wish it would. I get it.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.540
You know why? Why?

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.180
It's not your kind of game.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.700
Oh, I don't have the Xbox. Oh.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.620
That's why I would not, because I cannot.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.380
I'm not I'm also completely not mad about it.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.420
I still don't have a PlayStation five, and I kind of want to remedy that.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.940
But I'm at the point where I'm like, OK,

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.220
maybe they'll do a pro next year.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.900
But the reality is when Final Fantasy 16 is dated,

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.500
I will get a PlayStation five period. So.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.620
All right. If you can, if you can find one, that's always the the major caveat.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.740
Don't remind me. All right.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.220
Let's move on, Loki.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.260
So basically, according to Tom Henderson,

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:57.740
DICE had pitched Battlefield three, but it was rejected

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.180
by EA due to the cost of using the Star Wars license.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:07.340
I got turned down because it takes 20 percent more sales to make the same money.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.020
So instead, they're going to work on another Battlefield game.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:16.060
Like Battlefield 2042, the one that just got released

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:20.420
and also has the most is the worst reviewed game on Steam.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.660
That that series.

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.340
You know, the the battlefield Call of Duty, I guess.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.260
Tiger Claw on chat says, probably because EA got burned

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.460
by what happened with Battlefront two. Well, whose fault was that?

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:40.340
Whose fault was that was your fault and not for,

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.620
you know, not embracing the wonderful world of loot boxes.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.020
Don't you like surprises?

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.220
I hate how disconnected executives

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.100
are at these companies from fucking reality.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.060
It blows my mind.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.700
It blows that was a requirement to being an executive.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.540
Any three VL in chat says current Battlefield is buggy.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.180
Oh, yeah, we've been hearing about that.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.180
I mean, that's not the type of game I play, but I've definitely been hearing about that.

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.140
Another thing I've been hearing about quite a bit this week

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.060
has to do with a little company called Stream Labs.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:18.740
Oh, boy. So, oh, boy.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:23.540
There's a lot that Stream Labs really got a good dragging,

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.700
a hair pulling on social media this week, and it started with plagiarism

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.420
accusations, basically.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.260
There they've been working on a product that's very similar to Lightstream,

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.940
which is where you can stream without the need of a capture card.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.300
I think it just kind of pulls from like a I don't know how it actually works.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.580
I don't know if it's going through your mobile device or streaming like on

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.620
like your I think you're streaming it on your device to like a server

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.940
that then, you know, you you go through and broadcast on.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.740
I haven't really had to look into it

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.100
because I am fortunate enough to have a capture card.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.460
It's a thing that does stuff.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.100
But Stream Labs was going to launch their own version of it.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.420
And boy, oh boy, did Lightstream call them out on their bullshit.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.420
They they put out a tweet that was like when the other kid copies your homework.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.460
And I'm telling you, the Stream Labs launch page was like, copy, copy

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.740
down to the testament quotes.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.500
And of course, Stream Labs put out this apology that was like it was

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.980
something that was supposed to be a test page

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:32.300
that was not supposed to go into production well. Right.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.580
Well, but all right.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.980
I am going to take a step back.

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.740
Change the text and change the fonts.

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.180
Actually, I will tell you,

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:45.900
I have copied and pasted the layout for the sake of setting up my layout.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.460
I will typically not copy and paste text

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.180
and just do like the lorem ipsum text.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.220
But I I'm not going to fault.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.140
That is a statement.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.660
But I am going to say it's fucking lazy on their designers

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.860
part to have done it verbatim.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:10.140
Well, and also like it's not the fact is it's that coupled with the fact

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.500
that Stream Labs is essentially building off a knockoff software

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:18.140
of the page they stole that that isn't I think the problem

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.100
is that it's those two things together that make it really ugly.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.740
If they knocked off some other person's website for this product,

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.700
then, you know, they're still kind of, you know, being lazy.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.780
But at least they showed that there were multiple sources of inspiration

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.860
and not just one.

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.300
The other problem is then, oh, my God, the floodgates opened up.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.620
So then OBS sent out a tweet this week that was like, yeah.

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.500
So we asked while we're spilling tea. Yeah.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.100
What's while we're doing a dragging while we're doing a public,

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.700
you know, yoinking of Stream Labs,

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:56.900
we asked them not to use OBS in their name and they did it anyway. OOP.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.340
In response, they trademarked it.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.940
Yeah. Oh, that was the other.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.780
Oh, that was really shady, too.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:07.820
In response, Stream Labs sent out a lovely little white text

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.980
on a black background tweet,

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.260
which is this is the part that blows my mind.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.860
What they wrote is big enough for an actual tweet,

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.700
but they decided to do the white text on black background.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.820
OK, go off, because they probably copied it from somebody else.

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.980
They do a scream saying

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.100
it's it's done for effect.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.300
We are taking immediate action to remove OBS from our name.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:35.260
Stream Labs OBS is built on top of the OBS open source platform.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.300
Stream Labs OBS is also open source and our code is publicly available.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:43.180
We take responsibility for our actions and will support the community.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:48.100
I mean, this is the equivalent of like that scene from Game of Thrones

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.300
where she's having to parade naked through the town

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.260
and everybody's ringing the bell going shame, shame.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.580
That is what's happening to Stream Labs right now.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.660
And it's it just it just makes it feel like their entire business

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.140
is built on copying other people's homework.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.580
But the first time that's happened, I've been trying to

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.340
when you're entangled, though, in the Stream Labs ecosystem.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.980
Disentangling yourself is a pain in the ass.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.900
Yeah, because I'm having to do that right now.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.100
I've already, you know, my personal merch store away from it,

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.460
you know, which honestly, we'll talk about that offline,

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.620
but it was really easy to do.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.380
But, you know, all of my because I use cloud bot, you know,

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.500
changing everything over is not easy and they kind of make it that way.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.020
Elgato also dragged them because I believe Stream Labs

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.340
is launching an app that basically does the same thing as a stream deck.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:48.460
So, yeah, everybody's ringing their bells like now is the time.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.220
I think I think Festivus came early this year

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.900
because everyone's airing their grievances against Stream Labs.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.500
Interesting side effect

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.300
that hits close to home here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.060
and Vogue Network, where we broadcast every Sunday night.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.940
We had a year agreement through Stream Labs Space.

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.900
Well, not agreement because it wasn't like a contract or anything,

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.420
but basically we bought a year of Stream Labs Pro

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.260
so that we could sell the merchandise.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.260
You know, I always plug the shop at the end of the show.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:22.060
That contract was set to be renewed on the sorry, not contract,

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:25.940
but you know, the agreement agreement was set to be renewed on Friday.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.900
Bobby made an executive decision, which I supported, to not renew the agreement.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.100
Henceforth, there is no Vogue Network shop anymore.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.460
Actually, my understanding is it is still there.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.260
However, I cannot endorse it because I don't know

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.300
if we will actually make money off of it at this point.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.620
So I'm not going to be sharing that link right now.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:51.300
That's why Dark Soccer hinted we need to talk offline,

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.980
because an interesting sort of thing, the timer timer came up on Stream Labs.

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.660
We have opted, you know what?

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.620
Y'all are messy.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.860
We don't need to do messy.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.100
So we're going to we miss seeing this without y'all.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.740
And I think you're on the right track, Dark Soccer,

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.740
when you talk about untangling a little bit.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.380
So we're going to move the merch store somewhere else

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.300
and we're going to be doing stream elements.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.140
Bobby is doing a test tonight on stream elements

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.540
to make sure that a lot of the stuff that's kind of magic

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.740
that runs behind the scenes,

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.860
such as the bits and subs that scroll on the bottom

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.020
so people get their shout outs and all that.

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:32.620
He's actually running a test right now during tonight

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.380
to see if it's everything's cool, like nothing breaks or whatever.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:40.060
And we are looking at making the motion to change over to stream elements,

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.260
at least for that component after this week.

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.900
The hardest part that I see with all of that are because, you know,

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.180
I have my my shout commands.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.940
Not my shout commands.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.100
I mean, those I think I can move over pretty easy

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.220
if I use Chrome because there's a tool that does it.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.380
But the ones that I'm really the most concerned about

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.460
are going to be like my sound alerts.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.180
That I set up in slobs streamlabs ODS,

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.100
which thankfully they're changing that name, but it doesn't work with stadia.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.060
And I'm not the only person who notices how buggy their freaking app is

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.780
and what a resource hog it is.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.220
Yeah, I, I tried I use it just for setting stuff up.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.860
I tried slobs for like five seconds because I will admit

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.780
they have some really nice built in templates.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.580
Now, of course, when everybody has access to those templates,

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.140
you don't look so unique.

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.660
But it it was not running efficiently.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.980
Like I was getting frame skips.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.180
It was not running well on my computer, so I went back to OBS.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.460
Like it was like I think I maybe did one test stream in that.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.540
And I was like, nah, this isn't for me.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.580
It was the only way that I could possibly use chat bot because I'm on a Mac.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.820
I am proud of being on a Mac, but.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.500
They don't make chat bot chat bot for for Mac,

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.660
and since I'm on an M1, I can't run it through crossover.

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.580
So or or even emulated in wine.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.860
So I have to use cloud bot.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.860
And as it is, I'm going to be going over to whatever

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.940
stream elements users or go to nightbot like a bunch of people do.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:16.140
So but yeah, if anyone doesn't think that there's anything

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.620
if you're a new streamer and you only think that it's streamlabs,

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.620
you've got alternatives.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:25.700
Even Twitch has their own stream thing that you can use as well.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.580
That I think might be back, by the way.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.980
Oh, I think it might be built on top of OBS.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.140
I can't remember, but there it is built on OBS.

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.620
Yeah, there are plenty of options out there.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.980
Just so folks know.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.180
Anyway, and when I'll say one last thing about stream elements

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.780
for other streamers out there, they offer

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.420
um, uh,

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.420
sponsored streaming opportunities like left and right.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.140
Oh, neat. Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.940
I you know, we're going to look into that.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:55.060
I do really like the idea that their merch shop

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.740
allows you to give discounts to people who subscribe.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.740
I kind of love that.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.300
But I know you really enjoy the quality of the merch

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.260
that the store you've been working with has been putting out.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.380
So we'll figure it out. We'll come we'll figure out.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:11.620
But either way, you can actually do broader coupons with spring.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.300
I think. But yeah, offline.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.220
But either way, sorry, y'all.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.020
But the shop is closed just in time for the holiday shopping season.

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.460
Love that for us.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.540
But it'll come back bigger and better as soon as we can.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.260
So there you go.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.740
Let's see. I also want to point out,

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:32.100
Dark Tetsuya in chat said, good to know you'll move the shop elsewhere.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.340
Oh, yeah, we're not going to we don't want to get rid of ways

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.540
for you guys to help us financially pay for things like stream labs

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.220
that we end up canceling.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.700
Hello, we like money.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.580
I mean, we like keeping the show afloat.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.340
Yeah, exactly. Running a business takes a lot of money.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.500
And again, we really, really want to get back into live conventions

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.180
and all that good stuff. Anyway,

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.980
Dark Tetsuya says haven't been able to get a shirt or anything just yet

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.820
for various reasons, but hopefully by the time it finds a new home,

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.380
I'll be able to. I'm hoping in the next month or so,

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:03.540
we have this all figured if if that I I bet we're talking about this

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.420
in a week or two, which is we're going to miss

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.260
we're going to miss the biggest shopping day of the year.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.940
Oh, well, sorry, guys. All right.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.900
Let's move on. For the record, if I do recall correctly,

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.380
I think that you can have a limited number of merch

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.580
that you can share through the free version.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:22.220
Oh, that's cool, because having a merch shop,

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.980
they they make money off of it regardless.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.780
Oh, they sure do. Of course they do.

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.540
Yes. So if I do recall correctly,

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:31.580
you just have fewer things you can have on your storefront.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.740
All righty, let's move on and let's get back into games and less drama.

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:43.860
Dark Sakura. Well, general good guy all around Phil Spencer,

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:49.780
he has come out on record saying that he believes that a large focus

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.300
on video game preservation in the industry is a good idea

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:59.060
that he hopes to turn to emulation to preserve these games.

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.100
I'll read the quote. My hope and I think I have to present it that way

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.980
as of now is as an industry would work on legal emulation

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.420
that allowed modern hardware to run any within reason,

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:17.020
older executable, allowing someone to play any game there.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:23.020
And there is some backwards compatibility in a relatively limited fashion.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:27.500
Nintendo certainly, I think, has been the leader at this

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:34.780
with their online library of the NES, Genesis, all that stuff up there.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:40.340
Xbox just had 70 games added to its backwards compatibility list.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:46.860
So it's good to see that sort of dedication to keeping the old up

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.020
with the new so that people can see where their games came from.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.380
I think it's a great idea.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.060
When on top of that, we're also dealing with the 20th anniversary of Xbox,

01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:03.300
which my baking buddy, Seamus Blackley, has been posting about.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:07.260
It's been really neat watching the old pictures

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.940
and seeing the old ads pop up on my Twitter feed.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.540
But yeah, huh?

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.620
I was just going to say, good on Phil Spencer for kind of recognizing

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.020
this is an issue in the industry and trying to do something about it.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:23.660
Obviously, Microsoft did an about face with its own stance on emulation,

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:27.220
but I think in large part that's due to Phil Spencer coming on board,

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.900
you know, and really driving that.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.300
So that's a great thing.

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.740
And I bet Phil Spencer would love it

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:37.980
if other platforms might make their way over to Xbox and so forth.

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.060
We'll see, though.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:43.420
Of course, they had the opportunity with Game Room and decided to let that go.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.540
But again, that was not under Phil Spencer's call.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:50.220
So I will back off the attack dogs on that one because I bitch about it every week.

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:54.300
We don't blame him for the idiocy of others.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.380
No, we don't. We don't. We do not.

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:59.540
But good. This is a good stance and promising.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.620
I hope it moves, keeps moving in the right direction.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.980
I'm happy to hear it.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:06.540
There's really a second half to this, which Loki has,

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.660
and that is you kind of brought up the 20 years of Xbox

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.340
and there's there's even more, right, Loki?

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.980
Yes. Lots of exciting stuff.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.740
So they had announced

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.060
that there's going to be 70 plus classic games that are going to be coming to Xbox.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.860
Even some more with performance boosts as well.

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:29.500
So lots more backwards compatible games of that.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.380
I mean, you know, they've got several games from

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.300
pretty much the whole series of Fear is on there.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.260
Dead or Alive, you know, a few games of that beautiful Katamari.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.380
That's pretty cool.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.020
Then what else?

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.380
Oh, and Times players, too.

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.780
That's that's an excellent game.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.980
And then, hey, surprise.

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.860
We're putting out Halo Infinite's multiplayer early.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.700
You'll have to wait until December eight.

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.260
And apparently it's excellent.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:02.700
So that was a pretty cool surprise that they had.

01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.660
Then along with that, you can now

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:11.460
with the Xbox one, Xbox Series X and S, you can use Xbox

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.340
Cloud Gaming if you have Game Pass Ultimate as well.

01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.700
So that's pretty awesome.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.260
You don't have to necessarily do that now to a mobile or smartphone device.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.580
You can actually use your console,

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:25.460
which I think is the direction that they wanted to go with that stuff.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.860
And also, it's nice when you want to, say, play a game like,

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.700
I don't know, Flight Simulator or something like that.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.020
That would normally be a really large download.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.260
You can just kind of stream it.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.540
So pretty cool.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.460
Sorry, my sister is texting me

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.180
as if she doesn't know that I have a show right now.

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.420
That's why I keep looking at my phone.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:53.700
Sorry, guys. But yes, I thought the Xbox event was pretty cool.

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.700
I love that they have still enhanced the backwards compatibility.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.180
I know they've pretty much definitively said this time, this is it.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.220
There's no we're not doing any more work on backwards compatibility.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.460
This is this is it.

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.340
And that's OK.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.140
It's fair, obviously. Yeah, it's fair.

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.620
I mean, yes, I'm sure we can all think of games that are still missing DDR.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.020
It's still like it's still a lot.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.020
I mean, but yeah, DDR would be cool.

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:20.860
But Jet Set Radio Future in chat, I see being named, of course.

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.660
So that's a bummer.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:27.740
Yeah, but they still got like quite a bit in there,

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.980
and at least they're putting effort into it.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.020
So, you know, props for that.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.020
But yeah, I don't know. I get it.

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:42.300
So, yeah, also, I did I didn't mention it during my gaming week,

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.140
but I did lightly check out that shock Halo Infinite drop that they did.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.820
I did spend the hundred gigs of my bandwidth to download it

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.620
because we've been doing really good on bandwidth this month.

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:56.300
So I downloaded that Halo Infinite preview and I got through the tutorial,

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:01.620
at least now I did not know that there was a PvE or player versus bots mode.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.180
And Bobby was telling me about that before on his show tonight.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.700
So I definitely will check that out

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:09.900
because I'm still a little bit like like that Doom difficulty.

01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:13.780
Mommy, I'm too scared to die when it comes to Halo online right now.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:19.380
But I think I think the PvE thing Bobby was talking about is good.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.500
That's how I enjoyed playing other games, too, is PvE.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.860
But also, thankfully, now that I'm super into Dead by Daylight

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:31.820
and all this stuff, it's kind of softened me a little bit on playing with strangers,

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:35.700
even though it also still annoys the shit out of me sometimes like,

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.540
you know, when you're solo queuing and you get in a match against a Freddy

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:43.220
and everybody else decides to die on first hook because it's Freddy like

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.300
annoying. All right.

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.780
Anyway, but I won't I won't talk more about that.

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.220
Instead, I will talk about another old company.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.740
Trying to do new things.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:00.340
You know what, we give this company a lot of shit, and to be fair,

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.620
I kind of think it's justified most of the time.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.740
But this sounds kind of interesting.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.020
And it's Atari we're going to talk about.

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:11.700
Atari is going to be rolling out something called Atari XP.

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.340
This is not like an individual gamer product, but it's an initiative

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:20.940
for retro gaming enthusiasts, collectors, where you can get actual Atari

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:23.900
game cartridges from the 70s and 80s.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.300
But these are games that didn't really end up happening.

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:31.660
They're either things that probably showed up on a flashback console

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.580
or just straight up never happened.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.740
I think all of these showed up on a flashback at some point.

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.900
But Yars Return, Aquaventure and Saboteur.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.100
I know I've heard of Saboteur and the Yars one before.

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:46.940
Those games are going to be the first three that will be through this service.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.740
They are going to stay focused on Atari.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.340
Twenty six hundred fifty two hundred seventy eight hundred.

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.100
Not like Jaguar and the stuff that came after that stuff.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.860
No Tempest 3000.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.940
That would be rad.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.380
Yeah, I know. Well, who knows if these things sell really well.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.340
We've had plenty of other temps.

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.220
So anyway, these limited editions are newly manufactured.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.460
These are not old cartridges that were like dug out of landfill or something.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.620
These are being printed new.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:21.540
There will be an instruction manual and other bonus material, a collectible

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.100
pin and a badge, a certificate of authenticity, and you can even get

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:29.580
a digital copy to play on your Atari VCS like anyone else.

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.140
Come on now. But cute.

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:37.620
They're also saying one thousand nine hundred and eighty three copies of these

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.620
to signify the year they would have been released.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.860
Now, ready for the Whopper?

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:48.180
These games will go for one hundred and fifty dollars over at Atari XP dot com.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:53.620
But there will be standard editions cartridge only that are fifty dollars.

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:57.740
They are planning on doing more with Atari XP, including unreleased titles,

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:02.740
rare games, improved versions of classic games with refined

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.380
mechanics and graphics.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.700
Can you imagine a good E.T.?

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.740
Yes, except they're never going to get the license to do E.T.

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.860
again. They can't do that unless somebody wrote a real good contract

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.740
in nineteen eighty two or whatever that was, unless someone wrote a real good

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.060
contract. Atari is not going to be able to do another E.T..

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.660
The thing is, is that there's also other companies that have done

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:25.860
repros of prototypes.

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.740
Yeah. Like, you know, I've got a few of them.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:33.540
Like I have actually have a baby Pac-Man prototype.

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.620
Tempest, you know, lots of stuff like like that.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.260
And they sell them for a lot less.

01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.940
So I don't know what they what they think.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.100
It said that it is maybe that it is official and licensed.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.140
I don't know. Interesting.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.460
Bobby points out that some of these are homebrew.

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:55.500
I thought Saboteur in particular was like just an unreleased Atari game.

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:59.500
I didn't realize that Yars return or I'm sorry, I already forgot the name

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.660
was was a homebrew thing.

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:03.620
But Bobby says it came out in 2005.

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.220
They're just selling people's homebrews.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.860
Well, now maybe that's how the homebrews were able to be legitimized a little bit,

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:13.260
I guess. I mean, they were kind of making it on Atari's IP.

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:16.180
But hey, hopefully both ends are getting coin.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.860
Hopefully the homebrew makers get the coin.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:21.380
Atari's getting the coin because there's a lot of coin when you charge one hundred

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:25.020
fifty dollars. So that's what's kind of interesting.

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:28.020
So we talk about stealing the other ideas earlier.

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.940
We talked about stream labs and all that.

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.980
Atari is basically doing limited run games.

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:37.620
But I sort of think that's the wheelhouse they should be in.

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:42.620
And whether well, whether you agree this is the right price or not is all this stuff.

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:47.540
I think it's better than that joke of a new console they put out.

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.140
Not that long ago, although the hotel thing does sound rad.

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.500
That's not what I'm making that sound about.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:59.860
It's that they're they're not really imitating limited run because.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:03.660
Limited run doesn't have the monopoly on doing that either.

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.260
And they didn't copy the they didn't copy the website as far as we know.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:14.380
But I mean, a limited run of a game is just that limited printing of a game and

01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.740
companies have been doing that forever.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.580
So I don't know if that's the best comparison that I would have made.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.740
Well, that's fair. The reason why I bring it up is because the limited run games has

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.060
had such success with it.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:31.340
And I think I think it showed somebody at Atari, whoever's calling the shots there,

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:36.700
this could work because it's working over here for these guys and their NES replicas

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.140
of Mayman 2 and all this stuff.

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:43.580
So that's why I put it that way, is that, you know, yeah, yeah.

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:48.580
So anyway, Bobby also humble bragging a little bit, saying I bought Saboteur from

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:52.900
Howard Scott Warshaw directly and it's signed back in 2004.

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.020
Can we just give it up here for Howard Scott Warshaw right now?

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.700
He was a true genius of the 80s Atari games.

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:03.060
He is. And of course, I'm sure a lot of you guys remember the old commercials on that

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.780
network where he used to brag.

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:07.700
He made one of the best Atari 2600 games ever made.

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.420
Yars revenge and one of the worst E.T.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.780
But you all know the documentaries are out there.

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:18.980
What Howard Scott Warshaw was given six weeks and a bag of cocaine, allegedly, to make

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.180
E.T. happen. And you got what you got.

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.500
You talk. Oh, my God.

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.180
The broke ass game to make the holiday season is been a recurring theme in this

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:34.620
industry since literally eighty two, eighty three, whatever that E.T.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.780
game came out. And here we are.

01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:42.220
Twenty twenty one and take two still hasn't figured it out.

01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:49.740
Orange right says E.T., if it wasn't crunched, I mean, but back in the day, it really was

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.020
one person that made a lot of those games.

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.940
It really was. Bonds 006 says, but he did it.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.620
And that's why in many ways, E.T.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.580
is actually kind of awesome.

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:00.940
Yes, I said it.

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:06.300
E.T. is actually kind of awesome because he threw that together in six weeks.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.740
What have you done with the last six weeks?

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:15.700
I know I don't have a great answer for that, so I just I just think that's a great story

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:16.780
with that for what it is.

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:22.860
So, all right. I think a great segue into our next segment.

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.980
So let me roll the bump.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:41.980
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.700
a classic and tell you about it.

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:52.660
And dark soccer is going to tell you the game, and I'm going to warn you, I'm having to do this

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.100
a little differently tonight.

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:54.940
Apologies.

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:59.460
I neglected to rip the B roll in advance because I had a little bit of a busy Sunday.

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.300
But I think we got it.

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.300
So dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:10.220
The classic game of the week is Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which I played the shit out of.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:13.260
I even remember

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:19.780
Tiara visiting once and us playing through this game and having such a great time with it.

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:30.100
But anyway, it's by the company that acquired another company that's currently having some

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.260
problems right now, and I didn't realize it when I picked it.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:41.500
But it came out in 2006, it was an action role-playing game developed by Raven Software

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:46.900
for PS2, PS3, Xbox and Xbox 360, published by They Who Shall Not Be Named.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:54.780
It did have a port to PSP and Wii by Vicarious Visions, and then to Windows by Benox.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:00.980
There is a sort of Game Boy Advance version by Barking Lizards, and a remastered version

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:09.260
developed by Zoe Mode for Windows, PS4, Xbox One that came out 10 years later in 2016.

01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:19.140
So it is set in its own, I guess, part of the Marvel multiverse, where you have different

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:22.380
heroes, different villains, different supporting characters.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:28.020
And it's very similar to X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2 Rise of Apocalypse that you

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:35.060
have, you choose your different team from the roster there and different story objectives

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:35.580
that you go.

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:42.060
For this particular one, you have to defeat Doctor Doom and the Masters of Evil.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.420
It was a really good game.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.940
I mean, it was really fun.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:53.900
You had, like, just the best banter that went in in the game.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.660
It was so much fun.

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:02.060
I mean, I felt, you know, Ultimate Alliance 2 was really good.

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:08.140
Ultimate Alliance 3 was kind of, even though it was done by Team Ninja, but we won't talk

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:08.660
about that yet.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:16.340
Maybe in 2029, because that'll be 10 years after that.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:24.820
Anyway, you start from a cast of over 22 playable characters, although some of them are

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.140
not available when you start, you have to unlock them.

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:36.540
You also get bonuses if you form certain groups, like putting Avengers together, Defenders,

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:45.140
Fantastic Four, X-Men, Marvel Knights, you know, and then you have to do these different

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.420
missions as you keep going.

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.140
And you can switch between your characters.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.420
They've got special moves.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.620
You've got different things going.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.620
It's very much a masher game, though.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.980
I will be perfectly honest.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:03.940
There's also some differences in some of the other versions.

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:12.340
For Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Marketplace, you had a Heroes pack that gave you a few other

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:18.940
Marvel characters and you had a Villains pack, you know, and they came with different achievements.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.140
The Gold Edition has all of that in there.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.340
Of course, you know, if the game is successful, they're going to do 50 million different versions

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:25.740
of the game.

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:34.340
The Wii version has motion specific controls and they also have different missions and

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:38.340
added in a couple other characters, as did the PC version.

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.340
It has intuitive mouse controls, but it also will work with the game pad.

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.340
And then, of course, the Game Boy Advance version is just the sort of teeny version of it.

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.340
The game is beautiful.

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:54.340
You are traveling all through the Marvel universe.

01:35:54.940 --> 01:36:01.940
You go to Asgard, you go to space, you hang out with Galactus for a hot minute.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.940
It's pretty, pretty awesome.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.940
You've got so many different bosses in the game.

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:16.940
I like to pride myself on my comic book knowledge, although I will say that most of my knowledge

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.940
has to basically stay in the X-Men universe, but there's some pretty, pretty cool stuff.

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:25.540
And there's other characters that are just in cut scenes that's still a really good nod to.

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.540
It got really positive reviews.

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:39.540
For Metacritic, the initial console releases were over 80%.

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:43.540
Reviewers and magazines gave it really good reviews.

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.540
And like I said, there's been sequels.

01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.540
There was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.140
That was also pretty fun, but it was the stupid Civil War storyline,

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:58.140
which I hated the Civil War storyline from the comics, I won't go there.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:02.140
And then there was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 The Black Order.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:07.140
That was done by Team Ninja, and it's a reboot of the series,

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:12.140
so it's a different continuity from the first game, but it has kind of similar lines.

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:18.740
To this day, it's still a very solid, easy-to-play game.

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.740
It's got great story to it.

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740
It really is a lot of fun.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:31.740
I kind of want to hook up my Xbox again and play it,

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:35.740
just because I've had it kind of on my mind for a little bit.

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:40.740
It's really good, and I recommend if you haven't played it, why the fuck not?

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:45.740
Especially playing as Deadpool.

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.740
Sounds like there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:55.740
Very loved choice by chat, it sounds like.

01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:02.740
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, you have to remember the game came out after the last two games that were X-Men Legends 1 and 2.

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.740
That's what I said.

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.740
Questbuster says, replayability was great.

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:10.740
There was loot, unlockable characters, and a skill system to keep you coming back.

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.340
S.J. 100 Matt says, I got it on PS2 in storage somewhere.

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:19.340
S.J. 100 Matt also says, very button-mashy, but so much fun.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.340
Oh yeah, this was a stress relief game for me. I had a lot of fun.

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:31.340
And yes, I did mention right at the beginning that it was based off of the same for X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2.

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.340
Ah, gotcha.

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.340
I may have snuck in a potty bit.

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.940
Alright, awesome, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:48.940
So, let's get back into talking about some news, and we'll go now to rapid fire news.

01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.940
Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:56.940
Yeah, so we got news, and I'm not surprised because of all the backlash it received, but

01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.940
Saints Row has been delayed now to August of 2022.

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.540
And it's, you know, basically to give them more development time, which I'm totally cool with.

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:13.540
Let's let them take the time and make it good, and maybe come up with some different characters that they have in the game.

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.540
That's a tall order.

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.540
I'll give it a chance, I'll give it a chance. Actually, the gameplay looked pretty good.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:27.540
Still not sold on the characters yet, but if they have good writing and a good story behind them, maybe I'll come around.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.540
No promises.

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.140
No promises, yeah.

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:42.140
Something that's actually very insanely cool is this brand new Disney World DLC pack that's available for Minecraft Bedrock.

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:48.140
And what it adds is Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom, and it's a full park.

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:54.140
You can actually have all of the cast members sign a book, you have an autograph book that you can go through and stuff.

01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:58.140
And all of the rides are interactable.

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:03.740
You can actually ride all the rides, and it's extremely detailed with the copyright music and everything.

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:11.740
They even went so far, if you were to stream it, to have a content creator mode in it that will suppress the copyrighted music.

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:16.740
I checked out some video of it, it looks absolutely amazing.

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:24.740
It's just really realistic, like someone was playing the Buzz Lightyear ride, and you can actually shoot the targets and everything like that.

01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:26.740
Which is pretty awesome.

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.340
Do you have a reason to play Minecraft again?

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:31.340
I think so, I want to check this out.

01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:33.340
Autotopia.

01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:35.340
Yeah, all the rides are in there.

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:41.340
I actually was going to get this for my kid, but I probably will have to try it out myself too.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.340
It looks pretty cool.

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.340
Oh my gosh, Space Mountain.

01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.340
Yeah, Space Mountain is in it.

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.340
This is definitely the Disney World stuff.

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.340
Wow, I want to check it out.

01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:53.340
Can I get it on Xbox with that version?

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.340
Yes, that version is the one.

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.940
The DLC.

01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.940
That's pretty neat, I might have to check that out.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940
That's really clever and cool.

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.940
This looks pretty neat.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.940
The detail in it is amazing.

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:14.940
It's still Minecraft blocks, but they have an insane amount of custom items and obviously some customized stuff that they've coded into it.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.940
They have the fireworks show that you can do as well.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:18.940
Lots of cool stuff.

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:21.940
I saw some Grim Grinning Ghosts.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.940
Yes, yes.

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.540
And they even have the barbershop quartet.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.540
The Dapper Dans.

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:32.540
The Dapper Dans, they're in there.

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:34.540
That's fun.

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.540
Damn it, Disney.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.540
Alright.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:43.540
Dar Sakra, sorry to pull you away from that YouTube, but I know you have some headlines for us too.

01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:45.540
Yes.

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:53.140
So, there is an update for Mario Kart Live, even though not everyone has been super into it.

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:55.140
Alright, great.

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:59.140
Mario Kart live in a box, because that's where my Mario Kart Live is.

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:02.140
Well, it's being referred to as version 2.0.

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:15.140
It has a split screen mode, so you can have two karts on one switch, a relay race, you have the Luigi Cup, three new courses, which is King Boo's Courtyard, Music Broadway, and Windmill Meadows.

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:21.740
And an unlockable cart that you get if you place in all of the new courses.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.740
It's called Luigi's Poltergust.

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:27.740
And there you go.

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:30.740
If you're into it, maybe it's a reason to play again.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:32.740
There you go.

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.740
And then I have to tell this site that I don't want cookies.

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.740
I mean, I want real cookies, but whatever.

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:46.340
So Sega has clarified their stance on the Microsoft thing.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:52.340
Basically, the details are, I'm just going to go ahead and read this verbatim.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:55.340
We already have a close business relationship with Microsoft.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:43:06.340
We outsource the development of their large-scale titles, and as a third party, we are supplying a variety of titles, referring to their work on Halo Wars 2 and Age of Empires 4.

01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:17.940
So they're not talking about exclusivity, but to do a super game initiative, something that they're going to be working on together.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.940
Very curious to see what comes of that, that's for sure.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.940
All right.

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:27.940
Let's travel around the world and check out releases for this week.

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:34.940
I'm not sure we have a lot, a lot, because the games that want to be sold on Black Friday should be out by now.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:40.540
I guess we did have a couple of games that released last year on Black Friday, but let's check in with...

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.540
Does it exist in Japan?

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.540
Yeah, that's true.

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:44.540
We got the rest of the world too.

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.540
So, Loki, what's coming out this week?

01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:50.540
So, this week we've got not a whole ton.

01:43:50.540 --> 01:44:01.540
We have RE Legend, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:07.140
Death's Door, which is on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.140
That's it.

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:09.140
All right.

01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:11.140
As DarkSakura alluded to, much different story in Japan.

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.140
We have a lot of releases actually this week on the Switch.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.140
Ironically, Dead by Daylight, getting a fifth anniversary edition on the Nintendo Switch.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:24.140
And that is, they labeled it as in English, but it is a Japanese localized release.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.140
Kukiomi 123, also out in Japan this week on the Switch.

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:32.740
We have Deer Simulator, your average everyday deer game.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:34.740
I like that it's got an honest title.

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.740
I kind of want to play that.

01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.740
It's a goat stimulator.

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.740
It's really stupid.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:40.740
I like stupid.

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:41.740
It's pretty stupid.

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.740
Well, that's out in Japan this week.

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:47.740
We have Eastward, also coming out in Japan this week, all on the 25th.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.740
Asatsugatori is also out this week.

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:53.740
And we have some other games in regular and limited edition.

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.740
One releases Parfait Remake, and the other releases Fuyukiss.

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.340
Those are just the Nintendo Switch titles for this week.

01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.340
Taking a look at PlayStation 5.

01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:08.340
Farming Simulator 22 gets its Japanese release this week, as well as Disciples Liberation.

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.340
Treasures of the Agian, again, Dead by Daylight.

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.340
Aegean?

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.340
Yes, that's it.

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.340
Like the Aegean Sea?

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:20.340
Dead by Daylight also getting its Japanese release, or I think it's like a different bundle basically.

01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:24.340
I think it's been out in Japan, but the fifth anniversary edition is out this week.

01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:30.940
And then Cricket 22, the official game of the Ashes, also out in Japan this week.

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:36.940
And quickly glancing at the PlayStation 4 to see if there's anything that wasn't already covered on the Switch.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:43.940
I think mostly it's the same stuff, but you do have, oh okay, you get a price reduction on Need for Speed Heat.

01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:50.940
And then the whole, looks like Biohazard 25th, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, those different episodes.

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:57.540
Those are, I think they're a price reduction as well, happening on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.540
Dead by Daylight also on PS4 if you care.

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.540
Well, sometimes Jamie gets really bored early in the morning and watches Japanese streamers playing Dead by Daylight.

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.540
Oh, fun!

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:18.540
And sometimes they'll say, oh, you know, they'll actually talk to English viewers, so I think it's pretty fun.

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:23.140
Oh, that's neat. Well, they have a new retail release for whatever reason.

01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:29.140
I imagine it probably just bundles in some of the DLC and, you know, trying to draw new people into the game, so that is available.

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:34.140
Yep. All right, so for Europe then, right?

01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:35.140
Yep.

01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:38.140
Okay, just making sure you got everything because they're pretty big.

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:44.140
Well, it's already out now, but Farming Simulator 22 came out today.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.740
And then for the 23rd, we have Let's Sing 2022 on Switch.

01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:58.740
On the 25th, we have Cricket 22, the official games of the Ashes for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:01.740
We have Asterix and Obelix, slap them all.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:02.740
Funny comics.

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:07.740
So we have that on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:13.340
And then on the 26th, we have Windlands 2 for PlayStation.

01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.340
That's it.

01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:19.340
All right, that's it.

01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:26.340
We still have some more headlines for you guys and then, of course, we'll get to that part of the show where you can call in or email or any of that stuff.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.340
We'll get to that in just a little bit, but first, Loki with another headline.

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.340
Yeah, so this is kind of cool.

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.940
This is something that was more of a rumor in leaks.

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:41.940
We talked about like the fighting game that had like Shaggy and Superman and whatnot, but apparently it's actually a real thing.

01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:44.940
So it's going to be a free to play game that Warner games is putting out.

01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:52.940
And it's basically like a Smash Brothers game, but it has all sorts of different characters in it from different Warner Brothers properties.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:58.940
So right now, the roster that they showed off, they've got Aria Stark from Game of Thrones.

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:10.540
We have Batman, Superman, Bugs Bunny, Finn the Human, Jake Dogg, Harley Quinn, Shaggy, Tom and Jerry, Wonder Woman.

01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:17.540
And then they've got a new character that they created called Rain Dog and Garnet, who I have no idea what show she is from.

01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:20.540
That would probably be Steven Universe, right?

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.540
It may be Steven Universe.

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:24.540
Yeah, I'm not familiar with Steven Universe.

01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:35.140
This actually seems to be a little bit better than, say, the Nintendo one that just came out recently was you may remember that none of their characters were voice acted.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:40.140
Whereas in this one, all of the characters are voice acted and by the people that actually...

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.140
Did you mean Nickelodeon, not Nintendo?

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:43.140
Yeah, the Nickelodeon one.

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:44.140
Yeah, sorry.

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:45.140
Not Nintendo.

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.140
The Nickelodeon one is what I was talking about.

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:53.140
So they have like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:59.740
And of course, Maisie Williams reprising Aria and John DiMaggio as Jake the Dogg and stuff.

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:04.740
So very huge cast of voice actors in that.

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.740
It's supposed to be coming out later, I guess, next year and on all the consoles and PC and stuff.

01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:16.740
Many folks in chat referencing how this game appears to be very meme-ified.

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.740
It kind of seems to exist for the memes.

01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.340
Not only do you have Matthew Lillard doing Shaggy, which is something the internet is,

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:27.340
you know, memed all over the place, Pod Culture points out...

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.340
Casey Kasem is clearly dead.

01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:33.840
Pod Culture points out Shaggy has a Smoke Em Out move, which is obviously a wink and

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:36.340
a nod to what we all know Shaggy is doing.

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:38.340
And he can also Super Saiyan or whatever.

01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:40.340
So it's like the Super Shaggy thing.

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.340
Yeah.

01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:43.340
Does he have to eat a Scooby snack for it?

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:44.340
Yeah.

01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:48.740
Bonds 006 in chat says, to think, someone at WB actually went to their boss with this

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.740
idea and he approved it.

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:55.740
Well, you know what, we've had enough stories about idiot executives tonight.

01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.740
It's time to recognize a good one.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:00.740
So congrats that guy at WB who gave us the green light.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.740
It could be a lady, Rob.

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:03.740
You're right.

01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:06.740
Let's not give them credit for coming up with this idea.

01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.740
It's not a unique idea.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.740
Let's look at the history here.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:17.740
So we have Ready Player One that they tried this with already with shoehorning as many

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.740
things as possible in there.

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:25.740
Then Space Jam 2 or Ready Player One Part Two, where they tried shoehorning as many

01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.740
Warner Brothers properties as possible.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:31.740
Thankfully though, on the game side, it seemed to work out a little bit better because, you

01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:34.740
know, we've got Lego Dimensions, which is fantastic.

01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:39.740
So I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:43.740
Maybe can we get some like other properties like, you know, Lego Dimensions in this as

01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.740
well?

01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:45.740
I mean,

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:51.740
Because maybe we get Chell from, you know, portal fighting in here as well.

01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:52.740
No, no, no.

01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.740
We need Space Ghost.

01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:57.740
Space Ghost needs to be in it.

01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.740
Space Ghost is a superhero.

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.740
I'm sure there's plenty more lists to come.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:02.740
This is not going to be the end of it.

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:03.740
I'm yes.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:04.740
It's a small roster.

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:08.740
And they've already said that they're planning on adding more characters as they go along.

01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:10.740
And they have also different like skins and whatnot.

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:11.740
Obviously, free to play game.

01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:14.740
So you're going to, you know, buy stuff.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.740
What if they added in like Grape Ape?

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.740
There's a lot of things they could add in this.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.740
That would be though hilarious.

01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:23.740
Like this big giant character.

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.740
That would be awesome.

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:26.740
All right.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.740
Moving on.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:28.740
Let's talk about.

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.740
I'm a fan of the obscure.

01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:31.740
Moving on.

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:34.740
Let's talk about maybe this game will get nominated at next year's The Game Awards.

01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:36.740
I doubt it, but it might.

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.740
But we know the nominees for this year's The Game Awards.

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:42.740
This kind of snuck up on us, but it is around that time of year.

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:44.740
Usually Thanksgiving weeks away.

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.740
Yeah.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.740
It all moves so fast.

01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:55.740
Like we find out the nominees this week and then the ceremony is just in a couple of weeks, which it sounds like, by the way, I can't go because they didn't open the tickets to the public this year.

01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:56.740
So that's kind of a bummer.

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:00.740
But honestly, after reading the games that got nominated.

01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:04.740
There's a very obvious oversight in here, in my humble opinion.

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:09.740
However, the nominees for Game of the Year are Deathloop.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:10.740
Doesn't surprise me.

01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:20.740
A lot of people talking about kind of the story I haven't played yet, but a lot of people talking about the story of that game and how it's kind of pretty innovative, what it does with some of the time stuff and making that a mechanic.

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:23.740
It Takes Two was nominated.

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.740
Metroid Dread is nominated.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.740
So there's your Nintendo pick in the back.

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.740
There's always a Nintendo one in the back.

01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:32.740
Psychonauts 2 got a nomination as well.

01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:35.740
So that is the representative from the Xbox area.

01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:39.740
Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart, also nominated for Game of the Year.

01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:43.740
And Resident Evil Village, nominated for Game of the Year as well.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.740
So those are your nominees for Game of the Year.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.740
Nowhere to be seen.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.740
The game that has been getting tens, tens, tens across the board from all the critics.

01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.740
Forza Horizon 5.

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.740
Um, all right.

01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.740
I guess somebody thought...

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.740
The Game of War is more like fiscal year?

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.740
No, no, it is, it is, uh, it is calendar year.

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:08.740
It is allowed to be included if it was released before like November.

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:12.740
Basically all the games released before Black Friday are eligible in a nutshell.

01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.740
So yes, even though it was just a moment ago, it's kind of like the Oscar movies.

01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:19.740
As long as it plays in a theater in LA, in a theater in New York before the end of the year, it's eligible.

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:22.740
So, um, Forza should have been eligible.

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:28.740
Um, but I understand that some folks might find it a little bit reductive from part four

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:33.740
because, you know, it's more of the same even if it is really, really good what it is doing.

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:38.740
Um, I still think at some point you have to acknowledge what the series is doing.

01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.740
I'm sort of reminded of the Oscars when they finally recognized Return of the King

01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:45.740
as best picture of the year because the trilogy was over at that point.

01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:51.740
So I worry the Horizon series is not going to get its due until Playground Games comes out and says,

01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:54.740
this is the last one, which I don't want to ever see that happen to be quite honest.

01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:59.740
So, um, anyway, that's my piece on that. I said what I said.

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:02.740
Uh, this is an interesting layout of games.

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:07.740
And what's interesting about it, it's kind of hard for me to say X is the front runner.

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:12.740
I've heard a lot of buzz about all of these games in one way or another.

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.740
I'm not sure there is a front runner.

01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:21.740
I would guess Metroid Dread, but that might be a little bit of personal kind of coming into it.

01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:25.740
Um, Deathloop, I've also heard a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff about.

01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:29.740
Um, so, yeah, let's see.

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:35.740
Now, some folks in chat mentioning Mike Deft says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated for other awards.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:38.740
And Bobby Lockl says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated in three other categories.

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.740
Yes, yes, we love nominations in the technical categories for a pity award.

01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.740
Same thing happens with the movie awards, right?

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:50.740
You get this great movie and then it's like, oh, it got nominated for costume design.

01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:51.740
How cute.

01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.740
Um, not that costume design is important.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:55.740
I'm just saying.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.740
Uh, let's see.

01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:01.740
Mike Deft says I think Returnal is missing from that game of the year list.

01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:04.740
Not the first person I've heard say that.

01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:05.740
That's for sure.

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:12.740
I've seen a lot of that on social media is that people think because of the bugs that existed in Returnal at the very beginning,

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:17.740
it's kind of getting the shaft here, um, which, you know, is a problem all in itself.

01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:19.740
So that's somewhat interesting.

01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:20.740
Let me see.

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.740
There's a lot of categories, you guys.

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:27.740
I don't want to read them all, but let me see if there's another category I want to do here.

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:32.740
I want to talk about performance.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:33.740
Where is it?

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:38.740
There's like voice performance.

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.740
Hold on, I'm looking for a guy.

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.740
Sorry, I know this is terrible radio.

01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:42.740
There it is.

01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:43.740
Interesting.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:50.740
I don't know if it ever was split into actor and actress type of thing, but just a note.

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.740
Now it is just best performance.

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:57.740
I know I've seen another award show in gaming that was split, so I just think that's interesting.

01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.740
The nominees in that category.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.740
Erica Mori, nominated as Alex in Life is Strange True Colors.

01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:10.740
Giancarlo Esposito, nominated for Anton Castillo in Far Cry 6.

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.740
Jason Kelly, nominated as Colt Vaughn in Deathloop.

01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:19.740
Maggie Robertson, nominated as Lady Dimitrescu for Resident Evil Village.

01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:25.740
And Ozioma, I hope I said that right, Akaga as Juliana Blake in Deathloop as well.

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:29.740
There is a very clear front runner there in my opinion, but then again, I haven't played Deathloop.

01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:37.740
So maybe, but in my opinion, that Lady Dimitrescu kind of like own that game, but she wasn't in it very long.

01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:38.740
Spoiler alert.

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.740
So I don't know.

01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:42.740
So I don't know.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.740
Wasn't that Resident Evil and not Deathloop?

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.740
No, no. Yes.

01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:48.740
Yes. Lady Dimitrescu was in Resident Evil, but not for very long.

01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:54.740
Still, because I thought you were saying it in the context of Deathloop and I'm like, what?

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:55.740
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.

01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:56.740
Sorry.

01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.740
So, yeah, hold on.

01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.740
I'm looking to see if there's any comments there.

01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:03.740
Mike Deaf does say Deathloop has really good voice acting.

01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:05.740
Yeah, there you go.

01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:11.740
Garth the Wolf in Chat says doing Hades Extreme while listening to the show LMAO Loot Dragon Time.

01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.740
Hey, that's last year's Game of the Year right there.

01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:14.740
Or at least it was nominated.

01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:18.740
It didn't actually win, but I know it got nominated.

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:21.740
Yeah, Mike Deaf says Lady Dimitrescu is the people's vote.

01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:24.740
Yeah, Tigerclaw says Giancarlo Esposito is a good actor.

01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:25.740
He could win it.

01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:27.740
It's a good group, if nothing else.

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.740
So there is that.

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.740
So, yeah, I think that's all I'll read.

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:35.740
If you want to see more of the nominees, you can head on over to the Game Award websites.

01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:42.740
Of course, you can vote, but if you read the fine print, audience voting is only 10% of the vote.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:45.740
That way you guys can't fuck it up.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:49.740
The critics and the board still have 90% of the say.

01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:54.740
I haven't checked the fine print this year to see if maybe those numbers shifted, so disclaimer,

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:57.740
but I know in previous years the people's vote is only 10% of the vote.

01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:01.740
So just an interesting little footnote you may have missed.

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.740
All right, we have a few more stories for you guys.

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:06.740
Let's go to Dark Sakura with our next story.

01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:17.740
So, well, people like BTS, and BTS has been doing several collaborations across the board with other things.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:26.740
So they're actually going to be working with doing a collaboration with Among Us.

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:33.740
They're going to have the BT21 characters that were created by line friends

01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:40.740
to do all animated versions of the members of BTS for Among Us.

01:58:40.740 --> 01:58:42.740
So there you go.

01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:47.740
I don't listen to BTS. A lot of people do.

01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:56.740
I've listened to a few things, but I mean, I think it's kind of cool that there's this big international thing going on,

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.740
that they've hit it so big.

01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.740
They're involved in games that a lot of people around the world are going to be playing.

01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:04.740
So there you go.

01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:06.740
I'll be interested to see.

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:09.740
It would be a nice kick in the pants for Among Us, too.

01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:12.740
I know there's still people playing it, but I do kind of feel like that game sort of peaked,

01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:15.740
at least as far as like the Twitch interactivity and stuff, a while ago.

01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:19.740
Yes, I know people are still playing it, but not as many as were.

01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:25.740
But this could be the nice little like kick in the pants that that game could kind of use to get people to play it again.

01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.740
So we'll see.

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:30.740
I think it's more that people outside of the US are playing it more.

01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.740
Oh, good point. Fair point.

01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.740
You're not the only country in the world.

01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:35.740
That's true.

01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:39.740
Jason and chat are voiceover dudes saying Among Us collab, not Fortnite.

01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:40.740
Bless.

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.740
Hey, you know what, though?

01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:45.740
I have to say, remember the Ariana Grande Fortnite collab was actually pretty cool.

01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:50.740
Like in that day, take that for somebody who does not play Fortnite, but kind of wanted to for that.

01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:56.740
Garth, the wolf in chat says BTS came out with the best sauces McDonald's has had for their nuggies in years.

01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:57.740
Honestly, truth.

01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:02.740
Like I know BTS from the McDonald's meal and those sauces were really good.

02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:06.740
So there is they have I'm unfamiliar with.

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.740
I think they exist in other again, like dark soccer kind of pointed out other other parts of the world.

02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:14.740
And I think they just made them for the US for a short time.

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:19.740
I want to say there was a spicy chili sauce and some type of mustard sauce.

02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:23.740
Garth, the wolf. Correct me if I'm wrong. It was it was as like a spicy mustard as well.

02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:26.740
Maybe it was a chili sauce and spicy mustard, but they were really good.

02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:31.740
Oh, thank you. Garth, the wolf says Cajun and sweet chili were the two sauces.

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:37.740
OK, they were good. Who had the mustard? Somebody, another artist had the mustard then.

02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:42.740
Was that Saweetie? I don't know. All right. Anyway, moving on.

02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:46.740
Let's get to Loki's story.

02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:54.740
So this is out of like left field here, but apparently there was a video put up or a brand new site, I should say,

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:59.740
called Beyond the Groovy that's been put up by Interplay Entertainment.

02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:05.740
And it is kind of showing off Earthworm Jim as an animated series.

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:08.740
I don't know if these are like animation tests or what,

02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:15.740
but apparently there's an animated series for Earthworm Jim coming out. Wasn't there already?

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:21.740
Yeah, there was a cartoon in the past. This is going to be like a computer animated thing.

02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:26.740
It looks all right. I mean, I like I like the old cartoon,

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:32.740
so sure. Why not? Beats what Earthworm Jim 4 looks like.

02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:38.740
It's an interesting development as far as Intellivision having that property right now.

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:42.740
I don't put too much stock in that, but it's interesting.

02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.740
That's it. Like interesting can go a lot of ways. I just think it's interesting.

02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:54.740
Yeah. So. All right. Last. No one asked for this, but sure.

02:01:54.740 --> 02:02:02.740
Last but not least, I thought this was a very interesting story with the former VP of marketing for Nintendo of America.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:07.740
You know, the GameCube is 20 years old now. It originally came out in 2001 for the holidays.

02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:14.740
And here we are. Holidays 2021. VGC had an interview with Perrin Kaplan,

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:20.740
who you might remember from some of the older E3s who at the time was VP of marketing at Nintendo America.

02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:31.740
And in the interview, Perrin Kaplan mentioned that the PR marketing teams at Nintendo of America were not happy with the purple color choice for the GameCube.

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:37.740
And that these teams informed Nintendo Japan of this. But Nintendo Japan has the final say.

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:42.740
And so that was it. Nintendo America was told, nope, this is the direction we're going in.

02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:45.740
Nintendo of America wanted to do black and silver at launch,

02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:49.740
which is funny because those colors came later, if I'm not mistaken, because I had a silver one.

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:53.740
Thanks to Loki. Loki bought me a GameCube. Wasn't it a silver one? I think it was.

02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:59.740
So I liked purple. Yeah, I like the color. We never got over here with spice.

02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:05.740
Yeah. Yeah. But what's interesting now, here's the.

02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:14.740
Nintendo of America thought the purple GameCube looked too feminine and they were nervous that it would be slated at E3 based on the color.

02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:22.740
And here's the quote from Perrin Kaplan, who, if I'm not mistaken, is it wasn't Perrin Kaplan a one or is a woman?

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:28.740
I think so. What I remember. We actually suggested that the purple was not the best to start with.

02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:35.740
And Japan said, no, we're going to use that. Then we pushed for black and silver because I think in the US, nobody had ever really done the purple color before.

02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:40.740
It wasn't that you couldn't bring out hardware that was a different color. It was just a very female looking color.

02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:50.740
It just didn't feel masculine, I think. I remember us being very nervous at E3 that we were going to get bad press of purple based on the color.

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:59.740
Beth Lujan, who is the former director of corporate communications, says this predates Apple picking your color these days is like making a statement.

02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:03.740
But back then, all the game systems were black. Even white hadn't really been done widely.

02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:10.740
Nintendo was never a technology story, but we were always combating what our competitors at Sony and Microsoft were doing from a PR perspective.

02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:20.740
And having this purple box didn't quite help there. Beth, wasn't the Super Nintendo a white and purple console?

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:28.740
Am I am I recalling that incorrectly? Wasn't the Nintendo Entertainment System agree?

02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:35.740
All right. It was it was just two different shades of gray overseas.

02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:43.740
And I think that this might be, I hate to say it, but a coded phrase.

02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:55.740
And I'm going to just call it out there. I mean, I kind of think that there is a big stink of maybe some homophobia behind behind this comment.

02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:57.740
Interesting.

02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.740
Because I mean.

02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:11.740
There was like, well, what was it that I was reading that that things that are purple are coded to be more toward the LGBT community in marketing?

02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:14.740
I've heard that, too. Yeah.

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:19.740
And so I mean, so basically, like, does this make our system look gay?

02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:29.740
You know, that's how I'm I'm not going to fault Perrin for the compliment or for the comment, because she's speaking of an industry 20 years ago and that whole thing.

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:36.740
So I'm not I'm like, I'm not my target isn't on her for that comment, but it is just fascinating.

02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:40.740
And to look in retrospect, did anyone fucking care that it was purple?

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:44.740
Actually, I kind of liked that original car. I love my silver game.

02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:47.740
The purple was fine.

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:48.740
My purple.

02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:50.740
It's it's a weird comment.

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:58.740
That second comment that talks about all the other game consoles being black and white, that Atari had a very definitive kind of wood color to it.

02:05:58.740 --> 02:05:59.740
It wasn't really totally.

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:01.740
That was also the 70s, Rob.

02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:04.740
I know, but everything was wood paneled in the 70s.

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.740
Game systems are all sorts of colors.

02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.740
It's weird.

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:12.740
Channel F was what? Orange and yellow.

02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:14.740
That was also the 70s, though.

02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.740
TigerCon chat says, what's wrong with purple?

02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:17.740
Vogue network is purple.

02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:18.740
Nothing.

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:19.740
Nothing's wrong with purple.

02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.740
I love purple.

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.740
Twitch is purple everywhere.

02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:26.740
Like, but again, also talking about a different market.

02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.740
Yes. And Perrin is talking about an industry 20 years ago.

02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:36.740
And speech is very coded for meaning one thing and saying it a different way as so not to cause offense.

02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.740
Yeah, I get it.

02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:43.740
But it's not the first time I've I've heard that terminology used in a homophobic light.

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.740
You're right. She might be covering up for something way worse.

02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:58.740
And I understand that she got to choose her words carefully there, because, you know, if she potentially allegedly said what we are drawing conclusions to, admittedly, we don't know.

02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.740
We weren't in the room.

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.740
We don't know.

02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:07.740
But, you know, that obviously, if she'd said that very frankly, that would have caused a much bigger stink and she probably wouldn't be giving any more interviews.

02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:14.740
So which and probably, though, in the day, it would be said that way because.

02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:16.740
Yeah, I get it.

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.740
People today are a lot more conscious of it.

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.740
I get it. TigerClaw again with an excellent point.

02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.740
This is the last purple thing I'm going to read, guys.

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:28.740
TigerClaw in chat says Mace Windu's lightsaber was purple from the Star Wars prequels.

02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:30.740
That if I remember my.

02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:31.740
That was Samuel's pick.

02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:33.740
Yeah, it was Samuel L. Jackson's pick.

02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:38.740
He said he would only play the part if he could have a purple lightsaber and they gave it to him.

02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.740
So because he's Sammy fucking L.

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:42.740
Because Samuel L. Jackson's a fucking badass.

02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:45.740
We all know that. So he tells you to do something.

02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.740
You better listen.

02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:51.740
He needed to be in the room when they were choosing the color purple for the GameCube.

02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:55.740
He would have shut that down.

02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.740
Bitch.

02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:59.740
Exactly. All right.

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
Do you recall me giving you a choice of what color you could pick?

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.740
I don't think so.

02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:09.740
All right.

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:10.740
It's motherfucking purple.

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:12.740
Let's go to the listener roundtable.

02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.740
We invite your emails every week.

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.740
Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:20.740
I think I only saw a spam email in there, but I'll check with Dark Soccer.

02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:21.740
See if we got anything.

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:23.740
There were nothing but several spam emails.

02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:25.740
Only one that cleans out spam emails.

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:26.740
Apparently they found us.

02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:29.740
No, I get everything forwards to my personal email.

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:30.740
So I know there.

02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:31.740
So, yeah.

02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:32.740
All right.

02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:34.740
It wasn't nothing was deleted, but it's fine.

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:38.740
So I will invite calls if anyone wants to call in.

02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.740
Head on over to our discord.

02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.740
I'm watching Drag Race.

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:45.740
Vogue network dot com slash discord.

02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:46.740
Oh, yeah.

02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:48.740
We we usually do drag race talk when there's no emails.

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:51.740
But I can't watch any drag race now.

02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:52.740
So whatever.

02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:53.740
And none of it's on.

02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:54.740
Right.

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:57.740
I mean, there's international versions, but that's what I'm saying.

02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:58.740
I can't watch.

02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:02.740
I don't have any of the paramount shit.

02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:07.740
OK, let's go to questions in chat, which we invite those as well.

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.740
No one special.

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.740
Seventy seven has a good food related question to start us off.

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:13.740
I guess a little mini Orange Lounge foodie.

02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:17.740
Oh, do you associate eating a specific food with gaming?

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:19.740
If so, what food for me?

02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:23.740
I associate pizza and cola with gaming on account that I went to show

02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:25.740
this pizza place in the early 80s.

02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:28.740
And that was an early experience with gaming for me.

02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:31.740
Does anyone associate food with gaming?

02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:32.740
Yes.

02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:37.740
Is there a cheese sticks and DDR?

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:38.740
That's true.

02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:39.740
Where this show was born.

02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:40.740
Right.

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:44.740
Those good ass mozzarella cheese sticks that the cafe in front of

02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:45.740
Golf Land sold.

02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:46.740
Yeah.

02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:47.740
All right.

02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:48.740
I'm with you there.

02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:53.740
This question is a little weird for me now after everything I talked

02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:59.740
about last week, but I'm not sure I have.

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.740
I'm not sure I have, like, a Pavlov response to some sort of food

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:05.740
and gaming like that.

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:08.740
I mean, I do remember, like, like, you know, in special,

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:11.740
I do remember that my like an early,

02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:12.740
early gaming experience,

02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:17.740
like my first arcade memory I very clearly remember was playing Crystal

02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:20.740
Castles standing on a booster because kids had to use the boosters

02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:23.740
because we were short and it was at a Chuck E.

02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.740
Cheese pizza.

02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:28.740
So I associate like Crystal Castles with Chuck E.

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:29.740
Cheese.

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:32.740
But like, why would I ever in my life crave Chuck E.

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.740
Cheese pizza?

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740
Because the Chuck E.

02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.740
Cheese pizza back in the 80s was really good.

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:38.740
Okay.

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.740
Now, not so much.

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:45.740
And also, like, I remember then, like, they kept arcades,

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:48.740
like pretty dark because it's arcade games.

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.740
You don't want the glare on the screen.

02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:51.740
So good pizza, dark arcades.

02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:53.740
Yes, that's the way it is.

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:57.740
Now it's just like ticket spitters and bad pizza.

02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:58.740
I have one.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:10:59.740
Okay. Yes.

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:01.740
And then I have one that I know dark soccer will agree with.

02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:02.740
But you first.

02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:03.740
Pop Rocks.

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:05.740
Oh, how's that associate with games for you?

02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:08.740
Because when I worked in an arcade,

02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.740
remember I worked at one for a while,

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:12.740
I would save up all the little single tickets

02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:14.740
that people would leave in the machines.

02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:18.740
And I would redeem them for Pop Rocks during my shift.

02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:22.740
And then I would bounce around like a maniac my entire shift

02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:26.740
and then go home and crash hardcore.

02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:30.740
Like, I mean, the machines actually gave me migraines,

02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:33.740
which was pretty unfortunate given that I, you know,

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:35.740
like being saying that I could work at an arcade,

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:39.740
but it was Pop Rocks.

02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:40.740
And I mean,

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:43.740
and Pop Rocks and Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks

02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:46.740
also got me through my first exam week of college.

02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:50.740
The week I didn't sleep for a week.

02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:54.740
Going to chat, we have a few other comments on this.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:55.740
Garth the Wolf says,

02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:57.740
I associate Halo 3 with Cheez-Its

02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:00.740
because me and a friend ate them while playing together, LOL.

02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:05.740
And E3VL says, yeah, pizza back in the day was good,

02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:07.740
especially Pizza Hut before they changed the recipe.

02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.740
Okay, I have one more.

02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:11.740
Pizza Hut is so much better now.

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:13.740
I have a food association, Dark Soccer.

02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:14.740
I know you're going to.

02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:21.740
It's the drink propel and the DDR days.

02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:26.740
And that is like if you listen to the early episodes of OLR,

02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:27.740
not that I would encourage people to do that,

02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:29.740
but I know some of you do it anyway.

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:32.740
Like there were seriously like propel worship episodes

02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:33.740
of that show.

02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:34.740
We would drink it while doing the show.

02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:36.740
Now I can't stand that shit.

02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.740
I don't mind it, but I have the texture of it.

02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.740
I haven't checked to see if it jives

02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.740
with what I currently am facing,

02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:46.740
so probably not to be honest.

02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:48.740
Well, actually propel is sugar free.

02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:49.740
Oh, that's good.

02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:51.740
Okay, then I probably can have it.

02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:52.740
But I don't hate it.

02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:56.740
The other thing for me is Brookfield's Mini Loaves.

02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:58.740
Yeah, yeah.

02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:02.740
And I actually blame Jessica for that.

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:03.740
It's good stuff.

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:06.740
And now I cannot go to Brookfield's

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:10.740
without being pissed off that not all of them

02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:11.740
will have Mini Loaves available.

02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:12.740
Oh, they don't?

02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.740
That's unfortunate.

02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:17.740
To go with my Avgo Lemono that I've become addicted to.

02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:18.740
Yes.

02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:20.740
They had great chicken tortilla soup, too.

02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:22.740
Rob, let's go to Brookfield's.

02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:24.740
I'm challenged to eat some of the things

02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:25.740
I used to enjoy there.

02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.740
I guess I could always have a salad.

02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:28.740
There's other stuff.

02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:30.740
You can have me.

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.740
Also, in a couple months,

02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:34.740
we can reevaluate some things

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.740
and hopefully get to bring some things back.

02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:37.740
We'll see.

02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:38.740
We'll see.

02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:41.740
Okay, I did see a call sneak into the green room,

02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:44.740
so I want to take it because this is, of course,

02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:47.740
an old OLR favorite to invite back on the show here.

02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:50.740
So let's bring him into the room and say,

02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:52.740
hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.740
Who's this?

02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.740
This is YYR.

02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:58.740
Hey, YYR.

02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:02.740
Yes, I caught the tail end of your stream.

02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:04.740
I did.

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:06.740
Yeah, I was on mobile, so I wasn't really chatting,

02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:09.740
but your friend that you were playing with

02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.740
was playing Max 300 on standard

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:13.740
and used some type of modifier

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:17.740
that added extra notes in the middle of runs.

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:20.740
I was like, why on earth did you do that to yourself?

02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:25.740
Well, we were using all kinds of crazy mods

02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:26.740
the entire time.

02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:29.740
I would definitely encourage folks to check out the VOD.

02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:31.740
I'll link to it in the Discord.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:36.740
But some of the things we did included, you know,

02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:38.740
hidden plus sudden at the same time,

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.740
which StepMania does.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.740
DDR doesn't.

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.740
Basically, you get to see the arrows

02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.740
for just like a very short time in the middle.

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:50.740
And what else?

02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:52.740
I did a low-scoring set

02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:54.740
where I intentionally got the lowest possible passing score.

02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:57.740
I think I got about a 32% on expert.

02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.740
Congrats, I think.

02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:04.740
I played completely silent one song.

02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:07.740
I played the expert chart with no audio.

02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:10.740
I played the expert chart with different audio.

02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:15.740
And then just all kinds of other crazy, silly things

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:18.740
to try to break up the monotony a little bit.

02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:22.740
And I saw you raised some good money for charity,

02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:23.740
so congratulations.

02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:25.740
I apologize for the terrible camera angle in Discord.

02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:27.740
I'm doing my best here.

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:29.740
But now we actually brought,

02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:30.740
I don't know if you were listening

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:31.740
at the beginning of the show,

02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:32.740
but right at the beginning of the show,

02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:34.740
I did talk about your little announcement

02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:35.740
that you made at the end.

02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:38.740
Oh, I appreciate that.

02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:44.740
That you're adding the dance mode into super multitasking.

02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:46.740
But I couldn't remember all of the details

02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.740
about the other stuff too.

02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:50.740
Can you elaborate on what else you're working with

02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.740
with super multitasking?

02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:55.740
Well, I mean, I have to admit,

02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:59.740
I didn't do much apart from, you know,

02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:05.740
I didn't announce much apart from the workout mode.

02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:06.740
Okay.

02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:08.740
I'm working on the expansion.

02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:10.740
Oh, I see you allocated a spot for me.

02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:12.740
I guess I might as well do this.

02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:16.740
Sure.

02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.740
Access camera.

02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:19.740
Cool.

02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.740
Sup?

02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:21.740
Hi, good to see you.

02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:23.740
Thanks.

02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:27.740
So, yes, what I announced today,

02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:29.740
basically I'm working on the new minigames

02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:32.740
for the expansion that's still coming sometime next year.

02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:35.740
I don't want to commit to a certain time of the year,

02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:39.740
but several of them are done now.

02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:42.740
But the only one I have announced to date

02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:44.740
is this dance game.

02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:48.740
It plays on one of the thumb sticks.

02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:50.740
It's very simple.

02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:52.740
It only lasts for about 12 seconds,

02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:53.740
like all the others,

02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.740
and you just, you know, push in the proper direction

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:56.740
when the arrow comes up.

02:16:56.740 --> 02:17:01.740
But I really feel like I captured the feel of DDR pretty well.

02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:05.740
And it plays nicely, and I'm really excited about it.

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:09.740
But I knew from the very beginning that I, you know,

02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:12.740
from the moment I decided to put this minigame in there,

02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:15.740
I knew from the very beginning that I wanted to actually put

02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.740
a dance pad mode in the game.

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:22.740
Because, I mean, because I'm ridiculous, that's why.

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:27.740
And it, yeah, it actually plays really well,

02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:31.740
except for the fact that I need to work on the jump processing,

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:34.740
because DDR and Step Mania, I don't know if you noticed this,

02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:40.740
but if your feet don't go down at the exact same frame

02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:42.740
or moment when you're jumping,

02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:45.740
the game has some leniency on that.

02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:51.740
Right now, mine doesn't have that, so it will.

02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:54.740
But at the moment, you have to hit the jump.

02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.740
Both feet have to go down at the exact same moment,

02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:58.740
otherwise you miss.

02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:02.740
But I actually threw most of it together.

02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:05.740
Like, the actual full-length song mode,

02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:07.740
I actually threw most of it together yesterday.

02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:12.740
So, because in the regular super multitasking dance minigame,

02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:13.740
there are no jumps.

02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:15.740
Because how are you going to do a left-right jump

02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:16.740
with an analog stick?

02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:18.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense.

02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:21.740
It's going to be difficult enough, that's for sure.

02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:27.740
I watched you play that mode with the controller,

02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:29.740
because you tweeted OLR and I retweeted it

02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:33.740
so people could see it, and you had that,

02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:35.740
like you were playing the dance in the middle

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:37.740
on the dance pad using a controller,

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.740
and I just thought, I was like,

02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:44.740
way to make a zany, stress-filled game even more stressful.

02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:48.740
But hey, you can burn calories doing it, so awesome.

02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:50.740
If it makes you feel any better,

02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:53.740
you don't have to worry about the middle of the controller,

02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:56.740
the ABXY, it's just the stuff around it.

02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:57.740
So, just.

02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:59.740
I feel much better, thank you.

02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.740
But actually, that's not the only thing

02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:05.740
I wanted to talk about.

02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:07.740
I want to talk about a pretty awesome experience

02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.740
I had this week gaming on my Xbox

02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:14.740
when I actually made the few minutes to do that that I got.

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:21.740
So, Forza Horizon 5, you know how great this game is,

02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:25.740
but the one disappointing thing about it in my eyes,

02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:30.740
the biggest one, was the fact that I'm still rocking

02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:36.740
my Xbox One X on my big TV, and when it comes to driving games,

02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:38.740
I'm a frame rate snob.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:40.740
It has to be 60 frames per second or higher,

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:43.740
and I will not settle for less.

02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:48.740
In fact, that's why I bought my Xbox One X initially.

02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:50.740
It was to play Forza Horizon 4 at 60 FPS

02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:52.740
because I knew the performance mode was there,

02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:55.740
and it was to play Ori in 4K.

02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:58.740
So, and I still haven't even made the time

02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:01.740
to get back to the ladder yet,

02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:03.740
probably partially because I spent 500 hours

02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:05.740
playing Forza Horizon 4 on it.

02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:07.740
So, I got my money's worth.

02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:11.740
And to be clear, there is a 60 frame mode in Forza,

02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:14.740
but I believe it's only on Series X and maybe S,

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:15.740
but not the console.

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:16.740
It's on S.

02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:17.740
Yeah.

02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:20.740
Yeah, unfortunately, there is absolutely no performance mode

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:25.740
in Forza Horizon 5 if you're running it on an Xbox One X,

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:32.740
but I actually played Forza Horizon 5

02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:39.740
on my Xbox One X at 60 frames per second this week.

02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:40.740
Oh.

02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:45.740
Using cloud gaming.

02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:48.740
Oh, clever.

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:53.740
Because, first of all, you have to uninstall it from the hard drive.

02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:57.740
It won't offer you cloud gaming if the game is locally installed,

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:00.740
but if you then launch it,

02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:04.740
you're going to be playing it on an Xbox Series X

02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:06.740
somewhere in a data center.

02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:08.740
Right.

02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:11.740
And you just go to the menu from the initial screen

02:21:11.740 --> 02:21:14.740
and you turn on performance mode and it restarts

02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:19.740
and then you get the 60 FPS on a One X.

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:24.740
Now, did the artifacting or any of that stuff bother you

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:28.740
or were you very pleased with the experience of gaming in the cloud?

02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.740
There was definitely some artifacting.

02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:32.740
I can't hide that.

02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:38.740
However, if you've been watching digital cable YouTube videos,

02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:41.740
you know, for any length of time,

02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:44.740
you're probably already somewhat used to it,

02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:48.740
so I actually felt like, you know, the colors weren't as good,

02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:51.740
they weren't as vibrant, and yeah, the artifacting was there.

02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:53.740
But you know what?

02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:56.740
I enjoyed it more than I would have a 30 FPS mode.

02:21:56.740 --> 02:22:00.740
So for me, and here's the thing,

02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:03.740
I've used xCloud on my phone before,

02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:06.740
and on my computer as well,

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:09.740
and there was always enough lag on it

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:12.740
that I felt like it wasn't really playable,

02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:16.740
at least if you're moving at 200 miles per hour,

02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:19.740
because pretty much any lag is unacceptable.

02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:24.740
But on my console, mind you, it's directly wired to my router,

02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:28.740
but on my console, it played really, really well.

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:31.740
I did not notice the lag.

02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:36.740
Yeah, the cloud gaming is getting to be more and more impressive technology,

02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:39.740
and that's really any piece of the cloud gaming I've used,

02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:42.740
whether it be Stadia, which I know Dark Soccer is very familiar with,

02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:45.740
or the xCloud, which I think has also been a great experience,

02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.740
or the NVIDIA thing that's also in the cloud as well,

02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:51.740
you know, have all been pretty good,

02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:55.740
and it's interesting because I really do think there is a good chunk of gaming

02:22:55.740 --> 02:22:57.740
that's kind of headed this direction.

02:22:57.740 --> 02:22:59.740
Now, granted, Internet isn't everywhere yet,

02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:01.740
but, you know, 10 years from now,

02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.740
we're going to be talking about over-the-air 5G is what we have in our house,

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.740
and it's faster than cable,

02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:10.740
and it's going to be very interesting to see what that does for cloud gaming.

02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:14.740
Yeah, I mean, I have to say,

02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:18.740
my whole opinion of cloud gaming changed just in this one week,

02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:20.740
just with that one experience,

02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:24.740
because that basically told me that this is a viable thing,

02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:28.740
that, you know, this could be the future.

02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:30.740
It's crazy.

02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:32.740
I didn't think I would think this way,

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:36.740
but, and this is after I bought an Xbox Series S

02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:39.740
just so I could play the game at 60 FPS,

02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:42.740
but it's sitting at my computer desk over there, you know,

02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:46.740
and I guess I like playing on my TV for some reason.

02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:48.740
I love that story, though.

02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:50.740
You should tweet that to Microsoft.

02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:53.740
I bet they'll be very happy with it, so interesting.

02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:55.740
And you know what?

02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:59.740
It's funny because, you know, if you play cloud gaming,

02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:01.740
a lot of the time it pops up right after,

02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:03.740
oh, what did you think of this?

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:06.740
We want your feedback, and when I tell them,

02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:09.740
and when I tell them, yes, it was good,

02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:11.740
they ask, okay, what did you like about it?

02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:16.740
My use case is not one of the options.

02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:20.740
Oh, you don't get a box to fill in to put your own thing?

02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:25.740
No, no, they ask you to pick one of several choices.

02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:27.740
I thought they let you fill it in.

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:30.740
I like the fact that I could play anywhere.

02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:32.740
I like how it starts immediately.

02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:34.740
I like how I don't have to install anything.

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:38.740
I like that it's giving me access to Series X exclusive features.

02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:47.740
I really do like that, and yeah, it's pretty sweet.

02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:49.740
And you know what?

02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:55.740
I bet when, you know, word spreads about how well this runs,

02:24:55.740 --> 02:25:00.740
I think the resale value of some of these old VCR Xbox Ones

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:03.740
might go up a little bit because, you know,

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:05.740
maybe they're not worthless after all.

02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:11.740
Although I must say, when I got my Series S,

02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:17.740
I started looking at eBay to see what the resale value of an Xbox One S is.

02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:22.740
I don't know what the heck is going on with the console market right now

02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.740
because people are just bonkers.

02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:29.740
They're willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money for Xbox Ones

02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:32.740
and base PS4s right now.

02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:34.740
I guess it's because they can't get anything else.

02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:39.740
But $200 to $300 range, for the previous gen consoles,

02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:41.740
$200 to $300 range was commonplace.

02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:43.740
Wow.

02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:45.740
Yeah.

02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:47.740
It's bad.

02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:50.740
Well, while we are, I love that story,

02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:53.740
and I love what you did for your birthday stream,

02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.740
and I love that we all get to benefit with more bigger, better,

02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:58.740
super multitasking in the coming months.

02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.740
So if you guys haven't checked out my channel,

02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:04.740
So if you guys haven't checked it out on Steam already,

02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:06.740
what the hell are you waiting for?

02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:10.740
Get on it. Super multitasking available in the storefront.

02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:12.740
I don't know how to say it.

02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.740
It's like WarioWare, but more.

02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:17.740
More at once.

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.740
More at once.

02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:22.740
YYR, anything else to share with the audience before I let you go?

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.740
I think I'm tired.

02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:27.740
All right. All right. Go to bed.

02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:29.740
All right. Have a good night. Thanks for calling.

02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.740
We're very tired from all that dancing. Get some rest in.

02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:33.740
All right. Take care, buddy. It's good to hear from you.

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:35.740
Great week, everybody.

02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:37.740
Bye-bye.

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:40.740
Great to hear from our pal YYR here on the program.

02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:42.740
All right.

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:44.740
Let me see if we had any other...

02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:46.740
No, we didn't have any other calls.

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:49.740
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories.

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:51.740
No.

02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:54.740
It's going to start to get more to that slower time of year.

02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:56.740
I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover next week.

02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.740
We are still going to be here Sunday night.

02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:00.740
I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover.

02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:03.740
I really want to invite your questions and discussion topics for us.

02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:06.740
Mailbag... I'm sorry.

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.740
The mailbag address is

02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:10.740
participate at orangeloungeloungeradio.com

02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.740
is the place where you can send us an email.

02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:15.740
Oh, Bobby Blackall points out the Arcade 1UP Tron.

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:17.740
Yes, that's true.

02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:21.740
Should I talk about this? I don't know.

02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:25.740
I'm getting a little iffy on if I want to still do London next year.

02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:30.740
I really, really, really, really want to go to that concert.

02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:34.740
The thing that's obviously with the recent news

02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:37.740
that I talked about last week on the show,

02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:40.740
I'm starting to worry if that might kind of put a damper on things,

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:42.740
but what's really putting a damper on things

02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:44.740
is that COVID is coming back again,

02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:47.740
and now you look into all the travel restrictions.

02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:49.740
You want to go over there. You still have to get tested.

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.740
This is even if you're vaccinated.

02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:54.740
You still have to get tested on the second day that you're there.

02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:57.740
So it's like you have to spend money to do that and time to do that.

02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:01.740
So I'm starting to wonder if I just shouldn't

02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:04.740
axe that trip and get myself a Tron Arcade 1UP

02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:07.740
and some of the other things, but we'll see,

02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:09.740
to be determined on that.

02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:13.740
I got an Arcade 1UP actually just last week.

02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:15.740
Oh, yeah. Tell us about this because I saw the tweet.

02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:17.740
I got the tabletop Dig Dug.

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:19.740
Oh, I didn't know it was tabletop.

02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:22.740
I thought it was the standing one. Oh, that's cool.

02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:26.740
Yeah, I got the tabletop Dig Dug to go with our tabletop Galaga.

02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:28.740
Oh, I love that.

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:31.740
I didn't know there was a Dig Dug branded one.

02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:33.740
I imagine it's the same like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man,

02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:35.740
like all the Namco stuff in it, but that's pretty cool.

02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:39.740
Yeah, it's just Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.

02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:42.740
These are a little bit more limited.

02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:45.740
Oh, oh, not like cocktail tabletop.

02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.740
I know what you're talking about. I wanted that Dig Dug 1.

02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:49.740
I couldn't find it anywhere. Oh, I want it.

02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:54.740
They had exactly one left at a Ross Dress for Less.

02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:55.740
Wow.

02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:57.740
If I find another.

02:28:57.740 --> 02:28:58.740
Yeah, let me know.

02:28:58.740 --> 02:28:59.740
I will grab it for you.

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:02.740
I'll have to check those kind of stores in the area to see.

02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:07.740
Along with the other stuff that I've bought for you that I haven't given you.

02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:09.740
I still have a thing for you from L.A.

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:10.740
That's right.

02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:12.740
I still have a thing for you from L.A., yeah.

02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:14.740
I've got things in the pipeline.

02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:16.740
All right.

02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:17.740
All right.

02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:21.740
Well, if there's no other stories, then I think we'll go ahead and wrap it all up for tonight.

02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:24.740
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning into Orange Launch Radio and listening to our show.

02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:28.740
Whether you were here with us live or listening on the podcast feed, thank you for being here.

02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:30.740
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:33.740
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:35.740
but we need the voices to be here.

02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:41.740
So, yes, please consider following us on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network.

02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:45.740
A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Spotify, wherever did you find this show.

02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:47.740
Those go an awful long way as well.

02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:51.740
The merch shop is currently closed for maintenance, but we'll be bringing that back soon.

02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:55.740
Thanks to everyone who's gone out of their way and supported us with that in the past.

02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:59.740
And we look forward to maybe this will be an opportunity for some new merch in the future.

02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:04.740
I think that's all I have to say in my little spiel.

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:07.740
So, we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap on up.

02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:12.740
Dark Sakura will be keeping the party going with the after party and her dead by daylight.

02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:16.740
So, I will go to her first with her final thought.

02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:23.740
I should probably just play no-ed just for the sake of pissing people off tonight.

02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:24.740
I might do that.

02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:26.740
An all no-ed stream. Love it.

02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:29.740
An all no-ed stream and I want to see who it's going to be the meme.

02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:34.740
I'll use no-ed and then see if anybody gets a tree trunk up their ass over it.

02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:40.740
No-ed, haunted ground, I'm trying to think of the other like exposed iron maiden.

02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:44.740
My pig build is pretty mean as it is.

02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:50.740
Especially if I do like number two rule set and tamper timer when I don't have the VHS tape.

02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:54.740
I don't know. I'm pretty mean already.

02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:58.740
But how about a doctor with no-ed or a Freddy with no-ed?

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:00.740
All right. All right.

02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.740
Have fun being sweaty.

02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:04.740
I will see you in a little bit after the show.

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:08.740
Sweaty? That removes the sweat factor altogether.

02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:10.740
All right. Take care.

02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:12.740
All right. Bye.

02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:16.740
All right. And we'll go to Loki for your final thought tonight.

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:21.740
My final thought is I'm going to be very busy this week getting the last few episodes put together for my series.

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:25.740
And I can't wait to start the new stuff.

02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:31.740
My final thought I didn't stream as much as last week because I've really been trying to keep make room for Alan to stream.

02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:36.740
And I've been really into this ingress event that's going on right now and trying to get more exercise.

02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:39.740
And I hit some really good exercise goals I did yesterday and today.

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:41.740
Ten thousand steps. That's five miles.

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:44.740
So that's something I'm obviously with everything I've been talking about last week.

02:31:44.740 --> 02:31:51.740
But some of the signs of me doing good things is showing up already, which is very encouraging because it's only been a couple of weeks.

02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:53.740
So just y'all keep your fingers and your toes crossed.

02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:59.740
I can stay on this route because I would love to not that I'm going to kid myself this is going to go away completely,

02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:03.740
but I'd love to just be in a in a capacity with a little more flexibility.

02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:06.740
So we'll see. Fingers and toes crossed. Yes.

02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:09.740
You heard Matt says I didn't participate in community today was traveling.

02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:13.740
I only got five. I walked five miles and got five shiny shinxes.

02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.740
But that's plenty. I don't I don't need 40.

02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.740
I didn't check in with Shane to see how many he got to maybe check in for after the credits.

02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:25.740
All right. That is going to do it, though, for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:28.740
Thanks again. We'll see you in seven days for those of you in the states.

02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:31.740
Have a great Thanksgiving for everybody around the world.

We are thankful for you tuning in and supporting our show each and every week.

02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:42.740
Or even if this is the first week, I'm thankful you got to the end of the show because we had some angries earlier.

02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:48.740
So I appreciate you guys sticking with it. Happy gaming. Enjoy any of the new games you picked up this week.

02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:51.740
We'll be back to do it again in seven days. Have a great night, everybody.
