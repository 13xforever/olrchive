0	13800	This week, if you showed up and Bobby was an hour late or you showed up for Bobby and
13800	18960	got us instead, you probably forgot to set your clocks back or forgot that we did, hemispheres
18960	21480	and countries and the tyranny of clocks, something like that.
21480	26340	For the podcast listeners, it's just another day ending in Y or G if you're Swedish.
26340	30300	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you actual news.
30300	34420	Things like a Squid Game like games, certainly needed social dynamic changes and plenty more
34420	35940	news starting right now on the show.
35940	37260	Rera Gamer has a voice.
37260	48700	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48700	50700	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50700	51700	That's right.
51700	59900	A brand new time zone tonight and we are back with episode number 890 for this November
59900	62540	the 7th of 2021.
62540	63940	And on Twitch, I'm by myself right now.
63940	64940	Why is that?
64940	65940	There we go.
65940	66940	Hello.
66940	70060	I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my incredible co-hosts.
70060	73220	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73220	74220	Hi.
74220	76260	But you know, we're not really in a different time zone.
76260	77260	We're still Pacific time.
77260	78260	Yeah.
78260	80340	I should have said a different time, not time zone.
80340	84220	But you know, when you're trying to do camera changes with one hand and talking with your
84220	85220	mouth, it's a lot.
85220	86220	It's multitasking.
86220	87220	It's hard.
87220	88220	It's very hard.
88220	89420	I don't need to know what you're doing with one hand, Rob.
89420	93420	I got one hand in my pocket to quote an Alanis Morissette song, but that's all it's doing.
93420	98360	Anyway, DarkSakura, I wanted to start off the show by saying to you happy N7 day.
98360	101400	How did you, how did you spend your N7 day?
101400	102940	I was busy all day.
102940	106740	We did, it was really actually kind of a half work day for me.
106740	114460	I had to, I had a sister meeting this morning and it went two hours instead of one hour,
114460	116340	longer than two hours actually.
116340	118540	Are you back to doing those in person or is it still virtual?
118540	124180	No, we tried and then we went right back to zooming it.
124180	131740	And funny enough, I found that the thing I use for connecting my phone for, not for Twitch,
131740	136900	I use Twitch cam for that, but for discord works in zoom.
136900	144020	So I was able to, but for some reason, zoom doesn't like my headphones maybe because it's
144020	149440	hooked in through my microphone, maybe, but lots of house cleaning and I had to get some
149440	161100	groceries and, and yeah, just too busy today, but I but to celebrate, I did not play any
161100	165260	mass effect because I didn't have time and it still won't run on my Mac.
165260	171500	Well, that's a bummer, but yeah, that legendary edition, uh, I don't, I haven't touched it
171500	175500	myself in, since it really, like it came out, I didn't even beat mass effect one still.
175500	178740	I think Alan did a play through of it, but I never did.
178740	182220	And uh, I was kind of waiting for them to finish patching it because they were still
182220	183780	putting out patches after the fact.
183780	187820	So, um, well, I still haven't done animal crossing either just because of how busy I've
187820	188820	been.
188820	189820	So, Oh my gosh.
189820	191180	There's a lot of people playing that.
191180	194620	I haven't, I haven't gotten around to animal crossing yet either, but I know a lot of people
194620	196260	have been super enjoying that one.
196260	200620	Uh, I want to go to s two and a mat in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday
200620	203400	night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby black will
203400	207100	show at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
207100	208100	That's VOG network.
208100	209100	And that's the shoe.
209100	210100	One hundred.
210100	213140	Matt says, I didn't realize it was N seven day until an hour ago.
213140	217740	Um, neither did I, well, not an hour ago, but it was a good chunk into the day until
217740	221260	I realized, I think I was on Twitter and then I realized, Oh yeah, it is.
221260	222260	It's November 7th.
222260	225380	It's N seven day, but I wasn't expecting much this year.
225380	229340	Of course I should backtrack if you don't know what N seven day is, it's a tie into
229340	234700	the game series mass effect, which of course doc soccer and I fan boy and fangirl about,
234700	243220	uh, because, uh, it's an amazing series, um, and N seven refers to like, like the military
243220	247020	kind of special squad sort of thing that's in the game that shepherds apart.
247020	252380	They have like a seven levels of special ops and seven is the top designation.
252380	253600	Kind of like hell.
253600	257340	So you're in the seventh circle of alien hell in a mass effect.
257340	258340	So yeah.
258340	261620	So this is always kind of a special day and usually they drop some mass effect news.
261620	264420	They actually did today, and I don't know if you saw it, dark soccer, but they did put
264420	265420	out a poster.
265420	270100	They put out a new poster for the new game and it doesn't say much, but it kind of hints
270100	275220	that like the geth are strongly involved, which if it's a game in shepherd's universe
275220	276460	would make sense.
276460	280540	Uh, but it, you know, there's like this interesting shadow of like a geth figure that the, you
280540	281940	know, a picture makes out.
281940	283660	So it's kinda, kinda interesting.
283660	286860	But again, I saw that poster and I was like, looks great.
286860	288820	Too bad I won't play it till 2025.
288820	292920	Well, I would rather it take a while to come out and be good.
292920	293920	That is true.
293920	296600	We don't want them to rush it, but it does seem weird to like tease it.
296600	300940	You know, I'm just like, okay, it's like, it's like hyping a Marvel movie that won't
300940	303380	be out for three years, you know, it's, but it is what it is.
303380	304740	I guess people do that now anyway.
304740	305740	All right.
305740	306740	I reckon.
306740	307740	Also say hello.
307740	309980	Welcome back this week to Techmaster Loki.
309980	311700	Welcome back, Loki.
311700	316060	I guess we'll have to wait and see what they come up with for that new game.
316060	317060	And goodbye, Loki.
317060	318060	It was nice.
318060	319820	Uh, well, it wasn't nice having you.
319820	320820	Goodbye.
320820	321820	All right.
321820	322820	Uh, anyway.
322820	323820	Hey, dark soccer.
323820	324820	Let's no, I'm just kidding.
324820	325820	I'm just kidding.
325820	326820	All right.
326820	327820	How was your Halloween?
327820	328820	Loki?
328820	329820	Uh, it was fine.
329820	330820	It was pretty typical.
330820	331820	Took the kids out.
331820	334700	I was reading and got some candy.
334700	337940	Um, it was pretty short this year, so yeah.
337940	338940	Yeah.
338940	339940	Well, that's good.
339940	341900	They ain't getting good candy though.
341900	342900	Time.
342900	343900	No.
343900	347980	Why does, does dad go through the bag and pick out the ones he wants first?
347980	353340	Not really, but like, you know, like tootsie rolls and stuff.
353340	357220	So, uh, they didn't have any, so I had to buy my own.
357220	358220	Like I don't even know.
358220	360060	It's not worth it at that point.
360060	362020	Uh, let's see.
362020	364940	Bobby black Wolfen chat says the kids got some candy.
364940	366540	Loki got lots of candy.
366540	367540	Yes.
367540	370720	Three and a half pounds of candy.
370720	373820	Then the day after Halloween is when you go and you get all the on sale candy.
373820	375880	So yeah, that's how it works.
375880	376880	So yeah.
376880	378180	Um, okay.
378180	380080	What is the game playing behind you tonight?
380080	383340	I don't, I don't recognize it.
383340	387340	I don't know why, but like I was thinking about it today as I was kind of getting ready.
387340	391380	I'm like, well, what do I want to put in my background today?
391380	398740	And just for some reason, my brain being stupid, decided to shout out home improvement.
398740	401680	And I was like, I don't even know if there is a home improvement game, but apparently
401680	406760	there is, there is a home improvement game on the super Nintendo.
406760	410580	It's like home improvement search for tools or I remember it's search for something with
410580	414620	tools, but, um, it looks weird.
414620	419020	Believe it or not, they made a lot of bullshit games on the super Nintendo.
419020	423380	That's why, even though I wasn't sure if that's the case, I'm like, there's a good chance
423380	424540	that it's there.
424540	425540	Yeah.
425540	428900	We hope we hold the super Nintendo in high regard and mostly with good reason, but that,
428900	434420	you know, every system has its clunkers, you know, and, and there you go the whole game,
434420	437580	you know, he is basically fighting with tools and it's great.
437580	438660	He has a nail gun.
438660	442180	Looks like he's using a saw the fight off dinosaurs or something.
442180	444860	So, um, I'm down for that.
444860	446840	I need to see that in the awful block.
446840	448260	My one little weird, quirky thing.
448260	450540	I know I've mentioned this on the show before, but it's been a while.
450540	451540	Say it again.
451540	455420	My one little weird, quirky thing is that, um, I went to school with that kid's brother,
455420	459740	uh, the Jonathan Taylor Thomas, they used to live where I grew up, grew up and the kid's
459740	461420	brother was in my math class.
461420	466500	So yeah, it's just, it's, it's a small world, I guess, but yeah, I guess everybody's, you
466500	468780	know, got weird ties to someone famous like that.
469500	473680	But even I, you know, obviously I, we weren't like friends or anything, so I didn't really
473680	474680	keep in touch or whatever.
474680	478860	I had friends that were friends with him, but, um, I, uh, didn't really keep in touch.
478860	482100	Even I was wondering what the hell ever happened to that kid?
482100	485780	Like, cause you know, after home improvement, he kind of disappeared, right?
485780	490180	And then I guess they, they finally found him a few years ago, but yeah, it was funny.
490180	492300	He was here at this bar the whole time.
492300	494700	Oh, did you check under the rock?
494700	495700	All right.
495700	496700	Anyway, uh, let's see.
496700	500340	Bobby Blackwell in chat says, I think home improvement has been on games done quick before.
500340	501340	Oh, I'm sure.
501340	503300	As Jonah and Matt says, yeah, I remember the game now.
503300	504820	I remember renting it.
504820	508380	It's trash with 16 bit, Tim Allen, grunting sound effects.
508380	509380	Oh God.
509380	510380	That's the best part though.
510380	511380	Like seriously.
511380	516500	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I bought the last super Nintendo game ever officially released
516500	518440	in North America and it's so bad.
518440	521380	It's Frogger, but it's a bad version of Frogger.
521380	522380	Yikes.
522380	523380	That's every version of Frogger.
523380	525380	Except for the arcade.
525380	531620	Yeah, the original and Frogger two, three deep on the Commodore 64 was pretty good.
531620	537220	So anyway, okay, Loki, I have to ask you about this because you weren't here last week, so
537220	539060	you didn't get to do last week's news.
539060	543340	But when this story came up, like everybody was like, we need Loki here to talk about
543340	544340	this.
544340	549900	So I'm going to ask you now VR edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that meta is
549900	551460	talking about.
551460	555660	I already, now for the podcast listeners, you can't see his face, but you can imagine
555660	557540	his face.
557540	559500	I'm not buying a quest for this.
559500	560580	Like it's stupid.
560580	567500	Like they want, they want you to buy the quest to, to play San Andreas, which is super damn
567500	568500	old.
568500	569500	Like I, like I get it.
569500	570500	Yeah.
570500	577020	It'll be cool in VR, but let's be honest, like if I want to play that in VR, I'm pretty
577020	579380	sure modders can make a version that's in VR.
579380	582260	I'm sure that they've already made a version that's in VR.
582260	583260	Well, okay.
583260	588660	But to, to be fair, like the conversion of like forcing VR on games that weren't designed
588660	590720	for VR usually stinks.
590720	594620	Like it's a five minute novelty and then it's like, okay, this is garbage.
594620	600660	Like case in point, whoever modded the 8-bit Nintendo Legend of Zelda to run in VR, like,
600660	601660	and I'm not knocking this person.
601660	602660	Of course people want to see that.
602660	604820	That was like its own kind of independent thing.
604820	605820	I get that.
605820	606820	Yeah.
606820	607820	And it doesn't need to be there.
608260	610140	I think it's just such a gimmick.
610140	617260	Like, like it really is just such a gimmick to try to sell the Quest 2, which is stupid
617260	623060	because like I have a Rift S and like, I guess it's just not being supported anymore.
623060	626220	Even though I think it's probably more powerful than the Quest 2.
626220	632980	I mean, after all it's running on a PC, which is arguably more powerful than the Quest 2.
632980	634060	But sure, whatever.
634060	635060	Let's wall it behind.
635060	636060	I'm not buying another con.
636060	637060	I'm not buying it.
637300	638300	Sorry.
638300	639300	You know, I don't care how great it is.
639300	642620	I'll just not play it.
642620	643620	So whatever.
643620	645780	I mean, it's, it's fine.
645780	650660	Even like, I think we, they have like the remasters that they just, you know, they talked
650660	654740	about coming out and stuff and they actually, they, at least they did something with that.
654740	657940	At least the graphics look a little bit better.
657940	663660	Not great, but I mean the best, I guess they can do, but it's just very minimal effort.
663660	666260	Like I just don't, I don't care.
666460	671300	Bobby does want to clarify that the meta will no longer support PC VR, mobile VR is where
671300	672800	they see the market share.
672800	675780	And also wants to clarify, he still does not own a Quest.
675780	677380	The Rift has been discontinued.
677380	681300	So just to where are we, how, so we know where VR is at.
681300	682900	You know what?
682900	684460	I don't care, Facebook.
684460	686380	It works on PC.
686380	687700	There's other VR pro there.
687700	688700	You know what?
688700	691940	There's, I don't need a walled garden for VR.
691940	692940	Okay.
692940	693940	I don't.
693940	698460	Honestly, like it's just, there's so much stuff on scene.
698460	707460	Like really, like I don't need to play San Andreas again for like how many times now,
707460	708460	like I don't care.
708460	710980	I'm not going to wait for them to put it out on VR.
710980	715380	Now if it was a brand new Grand Theft Auto, which they really should be doing, like, let's
715380	720620	just put it this way, like develop a brand new Grand Theft Auto for the Quest 2 and then,
720620	723460	and then make that a VR only game, then that would be cool.
723500	726300	I'm sure they're developing a new Grand Theft Auto is just taking forever.
726300	727300	Yeah.
727300	733100	But I understand that, but like before, like there's been lower tier effort, uh, games
733100	740900	that have been put out by Rockstar, like they had a Grand Theft Auto for, uh, the DS, Chinatown
740900	741900	Wars came up last week.
741900	742900	Yeah.
742900	743900	Yeah.
743900	744900	Yeah.
744900	745900	So like something like that.
745900	747980	Um, I mean the PSP ports are pretty good.
747980	748980	Those had multiplayer.
749020	752500	That's why I started multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto with, was the PSP stuff.
752500	758220	Um, I just don't like, I would not, I would so not buy a Quest 2 for that.
758220	764100	Like I would just absolutely not, not worth it at all, but more power to them, I guess.
764100	766740	I just think this it's just stupid.
766740	770500	Bobby Blackwoven chat says there's not enough market share of VR to make a new Grand Theft
770500	771660	Auto for VR only.
771660	773180	I do agree with that.
773180	777740	And follows up saying Valve made a brand new Half-Life just for VR and everyone lost their
777740	778740	shit.
779500	782860	So, um, going back to that first thing that Bobby said there, uh, I thought this was a
782860	786860	good follow up comment and I haven't read this chatter before, so welcome and hello
786860	791980	XC Friesz, I hope I said the right XC Friesz, sorry, I'm not sure how to pronounce that.
791980	792980	My bad.
792980	796700	Uh, says, uh, I would like to get into VR, but terrified of buying something that will
796700	799260	be obsolete or abandoned soon after.
799260	802620	And I think that's a damn good point, especially when you consider, okay, well, Meta just walked
802620	804260	away from the rift.
804260	808220	That's why for me, and I know Meta's got something else in the works, blah, blah, blah, blah,
808220	811220	blah, blah, blah, but for me, that's why I'm like, you know what?
811220	815860	I'm just going to wait for PlayStation 5 VR because you know, it's coming, you know, it's
815860	816980	going to be a good baseline.
816980	818260	You know, it's going to be solid.
818260	820940	It's going to have a lot of games on it for gamers.
820940	825660	Whereas the Meta stuff will probably have a lot of other crap that Facebook wants to
825660	827900	push on it in some games too.
827900	828900	So you know what?
828900	833260	I'm just going to hang out for PlayStation 5 VR because I feel like the good baseline
833260	837940	for a gamer who wants VR is a game console doing VR.
837940	838940	And so that's for me.
838940	843660	The only positive I see with the Quest 2 is that you don't have, you're not really docked
843660	846700	to like a PC.
846700	849940	But really like anywhere in my house, I don't have enough room to do VR.
849940	851300	Like that's why I don't do VR.
851300	855700	That's why my, you know, Rift S is still in the box over here and my PlayStation VR is
855700	857060	in a box in another room.
857060	860100	You could try to do VR, but you'll trip on a toy.
860100	861380	You'll trip on a cat.
861380	866580	Yeah, so, so cat updates since I've been gone for a few weeks.
866580	868380	She's not doing great.
868380	876940	She's got, she, she is, health is definitely deteriorating, so she is, she is confined
876940	878280	to the kitchen now.
878280	882780	She does not, she, well, she still can't hear.
882780	886220	And now I think she can't see out of one side.
886220	888760	And so she, and she has brain issues.
888800	893260	So she circles and around and around and around and can't find things.
893260	897960	So then she's, you know, missing her litter box and stuff like that.
897960	902880	So she's, she sleeps now under my desk.
902880	905040	I don't know where she's wandered off to actually.
905040	906400	Well there's a lot of love.
906400	907400	She's under my wheels.
907400	909300	Okay, please don't.
909300	911920	There's a lot of love pouring out from the chat right now.
911920	915760	Send Stella some love from all of us, cause that's always difficult to hear.
915760	918120	Uh, I, did they say what the issue was?
918120	923200	Cause it sounds like almost like some sort of, um, brain.
923600	928080	Well, it is, but they can't do, she wants it still for an X-ray for her head.
928240	931900	And I'm not paying $3,000 to do advanced imaging at like Davis or something like
931900	937960	that, so it's probably something like a tumor or something, who knows, but we're
937960	944980	just keeping her comfortable, I guess for now, you tell me a people, a person has
944980	946780	these problems and I'm like, Oh, that sucks.
946780	948220	She told me a cat has these problems.
948220	951540	Like, like, no, I get very emotional.
952020	956060	So, but yeah, she's, she's been like, cause we, we had, it was weird.
956060	959900	Like she was like going to the bathroom behind the couch and stuff like that.
959900	963500	And just like, kind of like I noticed her circling around a bunch.
963540	966300	And so I don't think she can see out of the one side cause I can kind of come
966300	970380	up beside her and just like, Wave my hand in front of her and she doesn't see it.
970820	972400	Um, but she sees me on the other side.
972440	976760	And so she'll, she'll either follow the wall to, you know, kind of clockwise
976760	979560	around the room or she'll circle around.
980040	981960	Um, I don't know.
982080	984280	Well, she probably appreciates you giving her some cuddles.
984280	985760	So keep at it a little bit.
985760	986040	Yeah.
986040	990280	She's, she's got her bed underneath my desk, so she's always with me all day long.
990280	995240	And, um, you know, and keeping her locked up in, in the kitchen is good because
995240	996880	she's not getting lost in the house.
997480	997600	Yeah.
997640	999740	Um, so, all right.
1000600	1001720	Oh, unfortunately, yeah.
1002040	1002480	All right.
1002480	1003880	We've been dealing with the last few weeks.
1004600	1005080	All right.
1005120	1007080	Tough topic, but let's try to move on.
1007080	1011200	We're going to move on into, uh, some video game news going on around the world
1011200	1015240	and get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about a company I talk a lot
1015240	1019680	about on this show because I play a lot of their games, it's Niantic and Niantic.
1019720	1022560	You know, what's interesting just a couple of weeks ago on the show, we had talked
1022560	1026360	about how Niantic will not be moving forward with the Settlers of Catan game,
1026680	1028360	uh, that they never released here.
1028360	1030040	They released it in other countries.
1030160	1033600	I think Australia, New Zealand was kind of the biggest, um, market they put it out
1033600	1037560	in, uh, and the Catan game was out there for a while, but they did not continue
1037560	1040400	development of the game and they canceled it effectively.
1040680	1043680	Um, they may reuse some of the ideas somewhere else.
1043960	1047920	It sounded like to me, you know, and again, this is an interpretation.
1047920	1051160	This is not something they said, but it sounded like to me, them and the Catan
1051160	1052440	people were not seeing eye to eye.
1052440	1055680	The Catan license was likely expensive because Catan people didn't want to
1055680	1058920	continue with it because they didn't see a new Pokemon go in it or something.
1059200	1060760	Um, so that's what it sounded like.
1061160	1067160	Um, kind of a little bit surprising that God, not even a month later, uh, here we
1067160	1070360	are Niantic is going to be shutting down a game that did launch and launched
1070360	1070920	everywhere.
1071120	1074600	Uh, and this was a partnership to be fair with Portkey games.
1074640	1076760	So it's not just Niantic shutting it down.
1077080	1080640	Um, but certainly Niantic's name was involved with Harry Potter, Wizard's
1080640	1081160	Unite.
1081480	1085480	Um, Harry Potter, Wizard's Unite was kind of the game that came out after Pokemon
1085520	1088240	Go had a lot of similarities to Pokemon Go.
1088240	1091080	Certainly instead of capturing Pokemon, you were capturing what?
1091080	1096840	Like spirits, pages, ghosts, things from the Harry Potter universe, but it did
1096840	1101800	have a pretty neat battle system that Pokemon Go didn't have instead of like
1101800	1106840	tapping at gyms, you actually had kind of like your, um, you know, MMO triad of
1106840	1110760	healer tank, you know, DPS kind of thing going on where you were taking on
1111000	1111560	monsters.
1111800	1113880	Um, I played the game for a little bit.
1113960	1119240	Um, I got a little turned off to a lot of Harry Potter related things when, uh, the
1119240	1122760	author of the books started her social media bullshit, and I'll let you do your
1122760	1123760	own research on that.
1124080	1129520	Um, and my conclusion was that, you know what, I, I don't know how much I want to
1129520	1134320	be like, yeah, I'm super in Harry Potter right now, which sucks because there's a
1134320	1138200	lot of people that work on these games that do not share the same viewpoints of
1138200	1138800	the author.
1139040	1144640	But when she's out there just saying what she's saying, it's very hard to drop
1144640	1146960	money into the game, knowing that she's getting money in her pocket.
1147520	1149240	Um, I just got really bored with it.
1149680	1151480	And honestly, there's that too.
1151560	1154280	Like the grind was only good for so long.
1154480	1158760	Apparently the game got a lot better with the COVID changes that they made.
1158760	1161720	That's what I heard from the people that were still playing it at that point, um,
1161720	1163280	that they really added a lot to the game.
1163280	1166000	They finally added some stuff that probably should have been there when it
1166000	1168280	launched with some of the, um, Epic bosses.
1168280	1171240	Like you could take out Umbridge and I don't know all the characters, but you
1171240	1174400	know, some of the, some of the big, big characters, but unfortunately, uh, too
1174400	1179360	little, too late, I suppose, because the game is going offline on January 31st,
1179400	1180560	2022.
1180600	1184360	It will disappear from all the marketplaces December 6th.
1184720	1190320	In the meantime, go hog because rewards and cool down times will be, uh, I'm
1190320	1192600	sorry, increased rewards, decreased cool down times.
1193200	1196280	Basically, you know, they're throwing everything at you to enjoy the game.
1196320	1200480	Uh, while it's, it's lasting bosses events, they will continue going
1200480	1201880	live until the end of January.
1202160	1204800	If you spent money on the game, though, too bad.
1205160	1207160	The money's been spent, the checks have been cashed.
1207320	1211080	You will not be getting that money back unless there is a law in your country or
1211080	1213760	something where you must, uh, in the U S ain't one of them.
1213920	1216040	So, uh, there you go.
1216120	1219120	Um, it's closing.
1219360	1222280	Uh, the game had been released in June of 2019.
1222320	1224160	Honest to God, it felt like a lot longer.
1224200	1227760	I felt like that game had been out for at least at least three years, not two, but,
1227800	1229200	uh, there it is very long.
1229280	1230240	Yeah, it really doesn't.
1230240	1235960	And so I don't know, maybe COVID could partially be to blame for that, but I kind
1235960	1238240	of go back to, it wasn't very popular.
1238240	1243600	I think like, unfortunately we released it and like Ingress was, it was all right.
1243640	1246560	Um, everyone's really in the Pokemon go and then.
1247240	1249640	Wizards of the United seem to be kind of like a third wheel.
1249880	1253040	It's like, I think people tried it and they were like, eh, that's fine.
1253520	1255760	But like, it just didn't have the same power.
1256040	1259760	Um, Mike Defton chat says, technically it's more WB games shutting down this
1259760	1261400	game rather than Niantic though.
1261440	1263080	I believe that to be true.
1263080	1266600	I believe this is more port key games decisions, and maybe they didn't want to
1266600	1269600	keep paying to license Niantic light ship.
1269920	1273960	The, all the portal network, what used to be the Ingress portal network, that is all
1274000	1279600	now Niantic light ship, and that is their big, uh, platform of all, like your parks,
1279800	1284240	your play structures apart, all that shit that was submitted by mostly Ingress
1284240	1288440	players, and now a good chunk of Pokemon go players, especially in, um, countries
1288440	1291720	outside the U S uh, that is all now on Niantic light ship.
1291760	1293240	And actually it's interesting.
1293240	1296160	A friend of mine who, you know, has played all the, is just like me.
1296240	1300800	Like I have, you know, it's a lot of my Ingress friends are like me and that they
1300800	1301760	play all these games.
1301840	1303760	They will try all of these games at least once.
1303800	1305840	We, we just did a walk this weekend.
1305840	1309280	We were all playing Pikmin and doing a walk while we were playing Ingress.
1309280	1311160	Like we're just all kind of in that same mindset.
1311520	1316920	And one of them said to me, you know, um, WB and Warner brothers, porky probably
1316920	1320280	just didn't want to keep paying the fees for Niantic light ship and want to keep
1320280	1324520	licensing that you add that into Harry Potter's licensing fees.
1324640	1326520	That's an expensive game to keep going.
1326560	1327320	And for what?
1327920	1329240	And I kind of agree.
1329320	1330720	I think he hit the nail on the head.
1330720	1335040	I think it's not just the Harry Potter fee, but now Niantic fee that goes into
1335040	1338720	this as co-developer, I just don't think the game was worth it to keep running.
1338720	1342440	It wasn't selling enough of the microtransactions, especially in a COVID
1342440	1342880	world.
1343560	1344640	Uh, and that's that.
1344640	1349320	And that is, and as I expressed last week, that is kind of my fear with the Pikmin
1349320	1355000	game, the Pikmin game I'm actually rather enjoying because it is a low pressure,
1355000	1357840	low, um, intensity kind of game.
1357840	1361520	You can kind of set it and forget it a lot more with Pikmin than you do the other
1361520	1362240	Niantic games.
1362640	1366480	Um, but the microtransactions make no sense at all.
1366680	1367120	None.
1367640	1373360	And, uh, I just, I feel like, not that I am encouraging Pikmin to put more stuff
1373360	1376920	for more microtransactions in the game because I don't really want that.
1376920	1380840	But at the same time, I also realize, you know, developers have to get paid from
1380840	1381520	somewhere.
1381720	1385000	So I'd like there to be something worthwhile for them to toss a coin to.
1385040	1389960	And I don't think that exists in Pikmin Bloom right now and the Harry Potter game
1389960	1394600	at least once in a while, once in a while, I would say I probably gave 15 bucks, 10
1394600	1398920	bucks to Wizards Unite when I was actually playing it when it first came out.
1399560	1406080	So I, it's, I just hope that doesn't kill the Pikmin game that there's, it's, it
1406080	1408960	doesn't make money because I really don't see how the Pikmin game is going to make
1408960	1411120	money in its current state anyway.
1411680	1413320	So, all right.
1414080	1417320	Anyway, um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat.
1417360	1420800	Um, yeah, Questbuster points out Pikmin Bloom was just rolled out.
1420800	1422560	There's a Transformers game as well.
1422800	1426200	They might have decided to shutter the game to save on costs and push resources to
1426200	1426840	other projects.
1427120	1428960	I believe I could be wrong.
1429000	1434040	Somebody should fact check me on this, but I believe the Transformers game is like
1434440	1437600	the Harry Potter game where somebody else is developing it and using Niantic
1437600	1438920	Lightship in it.
1439200	1440040	I could be wrong.
1440720	1444080	Uh, as Joe and Hunter Mattis pointing out that Niantic is really investing in Pikmin
1444080	1447560	Bloom, uh, this is probably Nintendo as well.
1447720	1450760	They've bought some serious airtime and commercials for it, being seen the
1450760	1453360	commercials for prime during prime time, which isn't cheap.
1453600	1456640	You didn't see that with Pokemon Go for a while or at all with Pikmin.
1456800	1461160	Last I checked the Pikmin Bloom is number one in the like adventure games category.
1461160	1462400	So, I mean, it's paying off.
1462680	1466600	It's, it's not 2016 Pokemon Go.
1466920	1471320	Nothing ever will be again, but Pikmin seems to be doing all right.
1471840	1476000	But is it, you know, it's getting the installs, but is it making money?
1477200	1477720	I don't know.
1477720	1481280	I guess maybe players are probably buying that first timer starter kit thing, but I
1481280	1483000	don't know if they're getting it, uh, beyond that.
1483000	1483520	Who knows?
1484040	1487840	Um, Mike Defton chat says, don't know if this is coming up later, but now you have
1487840	1488760	a Niantic ID.
1488920	1490720	No, I did not show all that for later.
1490720	1494920	I'm glad you did bring that up because, um, yeah, everybody that's played a Niantic
1494920	1499680	game before is now getting emails to reserve your Niantic ID, but we kind of
1499680	1500520	knew this was coming.
1500520	1503960	If you looked at the acquisitions Niantics made, they've been wanting to build a
1503960	1506040	social network around this AR gaming.
1506040	1513440	And I, I really think Niantic wants to be in a place like Blizzard, but obviously all
1513440	1515720	this current stuff we've been talking about Blizzard accepted.
1515720	1516320	Don't go there.
1516320	1517080	That's not what I mean.
1517320	1521240	I'm talking about like battle net and all the Blizzard infrastructure and how those
1521240	1522200	games tie together.
1522200	1525000	And you kind of talk to friends through games and stuff, and they've kind of built
1525000	1526640	that experience on PC.
1526840	1528880	I think that's what Niantic wants in the mobile world.
1529240	1533160	And they think Pokemon go is going to get them there and it just well might to be
1533160	1533560	honest.
1533760	1537640	And if they can get Pikmin bloom to catch on huge too, that'll be more people for the
1537640	1539360	social network and that'll catch on as well.
1539720	1542480	But Harry Potter wasn't it.
1543240	1549800	So XC freeze and chat says, I wonder if WWE would be a good license to pick up for
1549800	1550320	Niantic.
1550520	1555680	I'm not sure how that would go into the real world very well, but, uh, yeah, anything's
1555680	1556080	possible.
1556080	1557720	I think there's a lot of different licenses.
1557720	1561920	People would like to see Niantic pick up and go with, but Harry Potter no longer going
1561920	1562680	to be one of them.
1562920	1563960	The game is closing.
1563960	1565120	So that's that.
1565160	1568560	And again, yeah, I th I don't think any of us are like super surprised.
1568600	1571680	I feel sorry for my friends that grinded to 60 in that game.
1572120	1577920	I think if this is what I think would be nice, but I'm not expecting it to happen.
1578800	1584400	If Niantic is launching a social network and if achievements are to be part of that
1584400	1587840	network, which I've been led to believe from some of the tea leaves and the stories that
1587840	1592320	have come out, it would be nice for the people that played Harry Potter wizard tonight to
1592320	1597040	have some sort of legacy achievement on their profile before they ax the game.
1597720	1601280	But because it's technically port key, and I don't know how that ties in.
1601640	1606120	I, that may not actually happen, but I do feel bad for those that, you know, really the
1606120	1609120	grind to level 60 in that game, no fucking joke.
1609360	1610080	That's a grind.
1610320	1615360	So, um, it would be nice if people had something to show for it besides Womp Womp, but
1615360	1618880	that's the reality of mobile games.
1619160	1620960	Your fave may go away someday.
1622360	1624160	Anyway, let's move on.
1624200	1627800	Uh, I talked a little bit about my gaming week in there, but I have more, but we'll
1627800	1630320	talk, go around the table and talk about our gaming weeks.
1630320	1634320	So let's go to Dark Sakura as we usually do first and talk about your gaming week.
1634320	1634800	Dark Sakura.
1635520	1636840	Pretty uneventful, actually.
1636840	1638640	I just played, um, Dead by Daylight.
1639320	1639880	Really?
1640440	1643840	Um, oh, and I played Mandalorian Pinball, so that was it.
1644400	1646960	Um, I was going to do Animal Crossing.
1647480	1649480	Um, real life has happened.
1649760	1653400	I have had so many projects that I've needed to wrap up that it's not even funny.
1654080	1657880	So just Dead by Daylight.
1658480	1659400	Real life happens.
1659400	1661120	Where's, um, where's Fantasian at?
1661200	1662240	You finished part two, right?
1662240	1663680	Oh yeah, I did play Fantasian.
1663680	1664520	I did play Fantasian.
1664920	1670040	Um, I am at just this really grindy spot and I'm trying to do as many different
1670040	1677880	sub missions as I can, but I think I need to buff up my people quite a bit more.
1677880	1679880	It says, oh, you can do this level 42.
1679880	1680400	Bullshit.
1681680	1685240	This is like this one attack that's just like completely ridiculous.
1685280	1689160	And like, I think I want to get my guys up to like 50 before I do it.
1689200	1689400	Yeah.
1689400	1692360	Whenever I see a warning like that, I'm like, no, I'll get to 45.
1693200	1697560	I've been able until this match to do things early.
1698360	1698760	Oh, interesting.
1698760	1702560	Kind of like how I did with Final Fantasy, uh, 10-2, not with 10-2.
1702760	1707640	Yeah, actually, yeah, it was actually both with 10 and 10-2 that I would just rush
1707640	1713240	through everything kind of outwit, you know, I guess the enemies.
1714400	1718160	And then I would finally get to a point where I couldn't do that because
1718160	1719800	it was all a matter of a power game.
1722760	1724120	And that's where I am on Fantation.
1725240	1727680	Um, and then how's how's Dead by Daylight been going?
1727680	1729480	You enjoying the Halloween event?
1730360	1730920	I am.
1731160	1734320	Um, I love stepping on pumpkins before the salty survivors can.
1736440	1742120	Um, I've actually had just like some funny people, like just like automatically
1742120	1743160	it's like, Hey, let's farm.
1743160	1744160	I'm like, okay, let's farm.
1744600	1753160	I made, um, new Twitch emotes for my channel that are very on point for me.
1753520	1756760	I have made a pig, a no boop and a boop.
1758880	1761480	Cause the no boop is no booping without consent.
1761640	1763680	You must always ask your pig before you boop her.
1764240	1766360	Which, which, but you can't chat in the game.
1766360	1768840	So you have to use nonverbal cues to do that.
1769560	1770160	Exactly.
1770160	1774120	If that pig growls at you, run, run.
1774240	1774720	All right.
1775520	1776840	Uh, let's go to Loki.
1776840	1777800	You have a couple of weeks.
1777800	1781000	I saw you had a new Minecraft video this week over on your YouTube channel at
1781000	1783000	Loki, OLR, plug, plug, plug, plug.
1783000	1784600	I did have a new Minecraft video.
1784600	1789040	So I finished the Ninjago city, uh, build that I was doing.
1789040	1793560	I got to add to it and I've been, uh, playing on multiple servers recently.
1793560	1799280	So it's, I've wasted a few days just playing Minecraft instead
1799280	1800440	of making stuff for Minecraft.
1800880	1803920	Um, so I'll be doing, uh, some more stuff for that soon.
1803920	1806240	I've been in the design process for that.
1806240	1807280	I know what I wanted to make.
1807280	1808240	I just have to design it.
1808760	1815880	And then, um, I played a little bit of, uh, Poppy's playtime chapter one.
1816200	1819400	This is the new hotness as far as a horror games go.
1819400	1820240	So it's,
1820240	1823000	Oh God, I saw someone streaming this the other night.
1823000	1824440	It looked fucking scary.
1824480	1828160	It's like, it's like, it's got a five nights vibe because it's all
1828160	1829520	like the plate, like play things.
1829520	1829880	Right.
1829880	1833200	But it's like, she was in an event, like climbing around the vent and
1833200	1835440	like the little, Oh my God, I couldn't play this.
1835480	1836360	I could not play this.
1836480	1838240	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1839120	1840920	Uh, I do like it.
1840920	1843600	It reminds me a lot of a little bit, like, uh, the puzzle solving and
1843600	1846240	portal because of the mechanics that they have in it.
1846240	1849640	So it's pretty fun, but yeah, there's, it's definitely more of like a
1849680	1851720	scary, almost FNAF type game.
1852120	1856240	I'm curious to see how this compares to like, say, uh, the
1856240	1857720	new FNAF game coming out.
1857720	1860080	So, um, curious to see how that is.
1860480	1866000	And then, uh, aside from that, I played a little bit of Orna
1866240	1867240	because I got a new phone.
1867240	1869960	So I was just messing around with that to see how much it's changed.
1869960	1871160	It's changed quite a bit.
1871280	1874600	Um, yeah, not very interested in it though.
1874640	1878880	It's more of like, you know, I'm sitting here, kids are doing piano
1878880	1879880	and I have nothing to do.
1880120	1882880	I've run out of internet to look at and play Orna for a sec.
1883280	1888480	Um, yeah, I don't know something to talk about, not having the same power.
1888480	1891280	Um, a couple of things I did want to mention though, cause I
1891280	1892400	haven't gotten to mention it yet.
1892400	1896280	So, uh, the game that you guys know called the pixel poops.
1896280	1899440	Number two is being featured in a magazine.
1899560	1905760	So the next issue of cool shit magazine, Bobby brought this up on his show.
1905800	1906560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1906560	1907760	Well, it was the week we were out.
1907760	1908080	Yeah.
1909000	1912880	So cool shit magazine, which is I think a UK publication, uh, somewhat
1912880	1915880	indie, they cover like retro gaming and.
1915880	1918200	Um, stuff like that.
1918280	1922760	And so they're going to have, they had like a kind of a giveaway thing where,
1923000	1927760	uh, the guy was running an ad, a one page ad, and he was also raffling
1927760	1931880	off, I guess, um, a couple like preview spots.
1931920	1935480	And so he, I got one of the previous spots, so he's going to cover the
1935480	1940080	game as a preview and like play through it and stuff and like, talk about that.
1940320	1944680	And then also at the same time, there's the, I want to say it's a Midwest
1944920	1949960	Midwest gaming conference or convention or something like that, a gaming classic
1950000	1955600	Midwest gaming classic there's the folks at, uh, nest maker that are there as well.
1955640	1961040	And they have, they're still in beta and it's not really open to the public yet
1961080	1964920	retro verse site, which is going to be featuring all of the nest maker games
1964920	1965800	that people have made.
1965800	1968640	And of course, one of those being pixel poops, number two.
1968840	1973040	So there's a chance that people that are at Midwest gaming classic or we're at
1973080	1975600	that, got a chance to play pixel poops number two.
1975600	1976200	So that's great.
1976200	1977720	I've been getting emails on that.
1977880	1979200	Like, did you give them my email?
1979200	1981240	I've been getting emails on that, but I'm like, oh, that's nice.
1981240	1984400	But it's like too far for me to really travel out there on a moment's notice.
1984400	1987880	But I've been seeing the, I didn't realize that was tied to your or either
1987880	1990920	that, or it's a big enough thing where it's a big, it's a big convention.
1990960	1991440	Wow.
1991440	1992480	It's not just, yeah.
1992600	1994600	I don't know how the hell they got my email, but cool.
1995080	1995840	They had a booth.
1995840	1996200	Yeah.
1996200	1999200	So they had a booth and there's some of the developers that also had booths there.
1999200	2001400	So one of them must be a listener.
2001440	2002640	So one of them, that's it.
2002640	2003800	One of them is a listener, I bet.
2003800	2004480	So shout out.
2005160	2005360	Yeah.
2005360	2009040	So I'm definitely have to pick up a copy of that magazine once it comes out.
2009080	2010920	Um, I don't know how to pick it up.
2011080	2013120	Maybe Barnes and Noble has something like that.
2013120	2013520	I don't know.
2013760	2015680	I don't know how wide their publication is.
2016280	2018960	Uh, might be able to order from Amazon UK.
2018960	2022720	Sometimes they'll ship to the U S and sometimes, uh, Amazon Canada will ship.
2022760	2027640	We also have some very kind listeners in the UK who may reach out to you on Twitter
2027680	2029720	and maybe can help you arrange something like that.
2029720	2030560	So at low key.
2030600	2035120	Also, I think the guy has, uh, yeah, so they do have an actual website as well.
2035200	2037720	Um, which I'll link in chat here.
2038080	2042160	Um, so they actually, I think they sell through the website as well.
2042440	2042800	Nice.
2042800	2045320	But, uh, I really want to see that.
2045320	2047880	I mean, if, uh, let me know how ordering the magazine goes.
2047880	2051080	I'll order my own copy, uh, if, uh, if it goes well, so let me know.
2051120	2051680	That's awesome.
2052200	2056040	Um, Just some quick followups, uh, in chat before I lose them quest
2056040	2059280	Buster did some research and wanted to mention the transformers game
2059280	2060000	that we brought up earlier.
2060000	2062920	That new AR game coming out, uh, quest buster did some research and
2062920	2067120	found it's an indie studio named very, very spaceship working with Niantic.
2067520	2068880	Thank you for researching that.
2068880	2069480	I appreciate you.
2069480	2074920	That's what I thought, uh, was that it was, uh, not actually developed by Niantic
2075200	2077360	and pod culture about the poppy.
2077400	2078240	What's that game called?
2078280	2081480	Poppy poppy poppy makes you poop.
2082320	2084840	No, it was Poppy's playhouse.
2084880	2085240	That's it.
2085240	2085840	Poppy's playoffs.
2085840	2086120	Okay.
2086200	2090720	Cause, uh, I was watching it's it's me Holly last night.
2090720	2092520	That's that's who, God damn it.
2092520	2094120	You always follow me on Twitter.
2094120	2095160	That's who I was watching.
2095760	2098240	I was looking after she played it and she was talking about it.
2098240	2099960	It was while she was playing medium.
2101240	2102120	I'm just dying.
2102280	2104200	You guys, you guys seriously don't know.
2104480	2108400	I will be in a channel and finally I'll decide to un-lurk and say, cause like I
2108400	2112400	usually watch on my Xbox, I have to get on my phone to actually type a message and
2112440	2116080	I'll say something and then dark soccer goes, Rob, she is all.
2116960	2119960	I'm like, do you have 10 tabs open with all the channels I watch?
2119960	2120840	You're always there.
2120840	2127040	I just like every so often I may have, I may lurk in a few other people's channels,
2127040	2128560	like, especially if I followed a raid.
2128800	2129160	Yeah.
2129200	2131720	But most of the time I pick one person and stay there.
2132000	2134440	But that's why, yeah, Holly is who I was watching play it as well.
2134480	2136640	She's very fun and animated and yeah, that game.
2136640	2137160	So anyway.
2137480	2137760	Okay.
2137760	2143960	So about that game, pod culture said next VOG point event, Rob plays this game live
2144160	2147480	and SSU 100 Matt says, not enough points to get Rob to play that.
2147600	2148640	Matt is correct.
2148920	2150200	You want this to happen?
2150200	2152040	We're going to be talking cash.
2152080	2153600	We're going to be talking charity event.
2153920	2154680	What charity?
2154720	2155240	I don't know.
2155320	2156960	Um, maybe cats.
2157000	2160200	Cause that's the thing, especially thinking about what Loki's going through.
2160200	2161320	And that's the thing we all love.
2161320	2162200	We all have our cats.
2162360	2163680	So maybe a cat charity.
2163960	2167640	Um, but I, I, I'm not going to set an amount yet.
2167800	2171080	I have to, I have to crunch some numbers and figure out what sounds
2171080	2173440	realistic, uh, to do something like that.
2173480	2175080	But, uh, no, you want that.
2175400	2178360	You have to show the money to the cats, uh, to make that happen.
2178400	2179080	So we'll see.
2179080	2181640	It's like a five nights type game.
2182680	2187400	It's not like it's, it's, it's not necessarily in the style.
2187440	2192280	I mean, it's five nights as far as like, if there's like animatronic
2192280	2198600	things that are alive, it's basically, it is a first person like puzzle game.
2199160	2201320	But there's horror stuff in it as well.
2201320	2204520	So that's why I kind of compared it to portal a little bit because
2204520	2208760	you've got these kind of like grabber hands that you put on.
2208960	2210560	And so you solve puzzles with it.
2210560	2211760	It's, it's pretty cool.
2212080	2213520	This looks, but it's also horror.
2213680	2214880	It's scary as fuck.
2214920	2215800	It doesn't look scary.
2215800	2216600	It looks adorable.
2218680	2220440	It's not necessarily adorable.
2220960	2222000	You probably want to play it.
2222080	2226600	That scary stuff is, uh, of course it's only on, um, on a PC.
2227600	2230920	Um, I think it's a really small studio, maybe like even one
2230920	2231880	person just putting it together.
2231880	2233840	So they only have one chapter right now.
2233840	2235720	That's out, that's like $5.
2235720	2238760	But in each piece, each episode is gonna be like five bucks as well.
2239160	2241920	I'm still going to go ahead and buy it now because I might
2241920	2243600	be able to play this on ARM.
2243800	2244960	So that'd be cool.
2245640	2249640	Uh, Mike Deft warns don't have more than three tabs of Twitch opened.
2249640	2251080	I forgot that that was a thing.
2251080	2251480	Yeah.
2251640	2255760	Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, uh, I think it, all your views are
2255800	2257040	all your views don't count.
2257040	2257880	Cause it thinks you're a bot.
2257880	2258720	It thinks you're a view bot.
2258840	2259800	If you have more than three open.
2259800	2263440	Well, I, I've got, I don't have any more than that usually.
2263720	2263920	Yeah.
2264400	2266920	Um, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, geez, am I the only one not wanting
2266920	2268440	to see her friend get traumatized?
2268480	2269040	Thank you.
2269040	2272840	But like, Hey, like I said earlier, cats are more important than people.
2272840	2275480	So I'll get traumatized to try to save a cat.
2275520	2276040	I'll do it.
2276120	2277480	Um, so there you go.
2277760	2278560	All right, Loki, I'm sorry.
2278560	2280640	We derailed a little bit from your gaming week.
2280680	2281680	So what else?
2281960	2282240	Sorry.
2282240	2282960	Alan came in the room.
2283320	2285920	Alan, the viewers are talking about Polly.
2286280	2290200	Playroom Polly's playroom, playtime, poppy playtime.
2290240	2290760	So, okay.
2291040	2295760	So they're trying to get me to play Poppy's playtime and with vlog points.
2296040	2297560	And I'm like, Oh no, no, no.
2297800	2299040	You want to see this happen.
2299040	2302120	You got to show money and we're going to do like a cat charity or something
2302120	2305240	like that if you want Poppy playtime to happen, have you, are you familiar
2305240	2306680	with Poppy play, Alan walked in the room.
2306680	2307800	Let me let him make comment.
2307960	2309080	Have you, have you seen this game?
2309080	2309680	Alan, what did you think?
2309800	2312800	I can't, I can't really get on camera the way it's set up right
2312800	2315400	now, um, episode one is out.
2315440	2316800	It's a very short demo.
2317360	2320200	Um, I don't want to give it away.
2320240	2321000	Basically.
2321040	2322880	There's just one really intense sequence.
2322880	2325720	And then if you make it through that, then it's like, congrats.
2325720	2326600	Wait for episode two.
2326600	2332920	So, I mean, I would say that you would be better off playing that than
2332920	2335240	you would a five night at Freddy's TBH.
2336440	2339920	I mean, it's, it's scary, but it's just, you know, it's a buildup.
2339920	2342440	And then, you know, the climax.
2343200	2343600	All right.
2343600	2344280	Fair enough.
2344360	2344640	Thank you.
2344640	2345600	Thank you for popping in.
2346160	2346800	Hey, Rob.
2347200	2347440	Yeah.
2347440	2347720	What?
2348360	2349840	You're going to want to check your steam and about,
2353840	2358640	I mean, like, I want to call you names, but then it's like, when you send me gifts,
2358640	2361920	like it's hard to call you names, but just know the urge is there.
2364240	2364760	There you go.
2364840	2367080	And you'll probably like the name I sent it from too.
2367200	2367760	Great.
2367800	2368360	All right.
2368720	2369120	All right.
2369120	2369600	Loki.
2369600	2370160	We've derailed.
2370160	2370960	Congratulations, Rob.
2370960	2372320	You have a scary game.
2372800	2374120	We've derailed the cats.
2374120	2374760	Say thank you.
2374800	2377880	Uh, Loki, I've derailed your gaming week three times now.
2377880	2378800	Anything else for your gaming week?
2379600	2380800	Um, that's it.
2380880	2385880	I'm probably going to have to dust off my Xbox series X though, for next week,
2385920	2390080	because you know, we got fours of horizon five coming, so I got to play a little bit
2390080	2395120	of that at least our pal Bobby Black Wolf was, uh, got to have the look at that game.
2395120	2398160	Cause he, uh, did the, you know, addition that had the early launch
2398160	2400720	and, uh, his, uh, reactions on his show were very good.
2401080	2401800	Very, very good.
2401960	2403480	Oh, thank you.
2403520	2405560	Alan just brought into the room and reminded me.
2405560	2407920	So dark soccer, can you see my cam dark soccer?
2408000	2409240	Are you, do you have Twitch open?
2410120	2414520	Um, I usually don't play the thing.
2414520	2417880	Well, um, for some reason it says I'm not hosting, hold on, give me just a second.
2417880	2422840	Cause cause Alan came in here, reminded me, we have something for you, dark soccer.
2422840	2425480	And I, I can't, Alan, can you hold that closer to the cancer?
2425480	2429480	The name can, that the name is a little, see, it actually says.
2429800	2435080	Sakura, but in addition to that, Alan decided he wanted to add something extra into it.
2435080	2436120	Can you put that on cam as well?
2436920	2437160	Yeah.
2437800	2440760	Or what, whatever, I thought you bought one for her.
2442840	2447800	Oh, and Alan says they just opened this store at Arden fair where I found this.
2447800	2449400	It opened at Arden fair on Saturday.
2449960	2453080	So this, no, no, no mini, mini.
2453080	2454520	So mini cell.
2454520	2455000	Oh, okay.
2455640	2456440	And it just opened.
2456680	2456920	Cool.
2457480	2459000	Wait, are these for Jamie or?
2461000	2461800	Oh, those are for you.
2461800	2462120	Oh, okay.
2462120	2462520	I'm sorry.
2462520	2463640	These are not for you, Jamie.
2463640	2463960	Sorry.
2463960	2469560	He just wants to show them off, but he got a Pokemon face mask with mu.
2470520	2473240	And I think there's some other Pokemon face masks as well.
2474840	2475640	Oh, there's an act deaf.
2475640	2476920	That's an act deaf face mask.
2477480	2478520	So there you go.
2478520	2479880	Mike deaf says, oh, we have a mini.
2479880	2480520	So where I live.
2480520	2481080	Well, there you go.
2481080	2482680	You got to go get that Kirby face mask.
2485080	2486360	Oh, that one's super cute.
2486920	2490600	Oh, I know the, the, the crime shop.
2490600	2493080	I've I buy a lot of their masks.
2493080	2497320	I saw the new, um, was it build a bear, uh, animal crossing figures.
2497320	2500840	They had them in the storefront when we went by there the other day.
2500840	2503560	They had a line out the door for something.
2503560	2504280	I don't know.
2504280	2506680	Probably those certainly wasn't animal crossing stuff.
2507400	2512600	I, I just ordered my, um, Tom Nook, uh, holiday ornament.
2513880	2514280	Love it.
2515000	2515320	All right.
2515880	2518920	My gaming week, um, kind of along the same lines as dark soccer.
2518920	2520360	I had a lot going on this week.
2520840	2523160	Um, I've been going hog on Pikmin bloom.
2523160	2526200	Like Pikmin bloom kind of came out at a really good time where I'm trying
2526200	2527560	to really change my lifestyle.
2527560	2532600	And you know, of these past couple of years, COVID has taken its toll
2532600	2534200	in many, many, many ways.
2534200	2539400	Um, and walking, um, is something I really need to be doing more of.
2539400	2542680	And I think Pikmin's like this game came out at the right time to
2542680	2544040	really incentivize some of that.
2545000	2547480	So I'm level 17 in Pikmin bloom.
2547480	2549400	I'm not the highest on my friends list though.
2549400	2552840	Uh, somebody, somebody I'm friends with in Korea is level 20.
2552840	2554600	I think 21 at this point.
2554600	2559800	So, um, yeah, but I, I've just been having a good time, uh, walking and
2559800	2562760	just knowing that I'm leaving a little trail of flowers.
2562760	2567240	When I, when I opt into it and, uh, sending a little Pikmin on adventures,
2567240	2569960	you have to get, and for those that are getting into the game,
2569960	2572200	you unlock things slowly.
2572200	2573720	And I didn't even know this last week,
2573720	2578280	but once you get to level 15, you have to get all the way to level 15.
2578280	2582520	Then you unlock Pikmin Bloom's version of raids where you can go beat up on
2582520	2585720	mushrooms, which I guess is, um, from the console games.
2585720	2589960	Uh, and you get little like postcards and, and limited pedal things from that.
2589960	2591560	So you get like some good stuff from that.
2591560	2594040	So, um, yeah.
2594040	2596280	Uh, Pikmin Bloom is super cute and I'm still playing that.
2596280	2597960	Otherwise kind of the same stuff.
2597960	2599640	Final Fantasy 14.
2599640	2606120	Uh, I am, uh, just got my Warrior to 77 and that is my last job to get to 80.
2606120	2607960	I hit Black Mage 80 in the last week.
2607960	2611400	So only one more job to get to 80 and then everything will be 80.
2611400	2614120	Only other thing to really mention for my gaming week, No Man's Sky.
2614760	2618440	It took me a little bit because the new expedition came out that weekend.
2618440	2621720	I went to Disneyland, but, um, I'm finally, I was like, okay,
2621720	2624520	two weeks is enough for them to patch everything that went wrong
2624520	2625960	with the expedition when it came out.
2625960	2628440	So I started playing the expedition, like for realsies.
2628440	2632360	And, uh, I'm up to phase two in the X, I just got to the second,
2632360	2635080	uh, rendezvous point, uh, in, in there.
2635080	2637160	So I've still got a few more phases to go.
2637160	2641480	It's all about worms, sandworms that, that fly out of the planet.
2641480	2643160	And it didn't hit me.
2643160	2644280	Okay, tremors.
2644280	2650760	Well, no, what it is, it's not officially a tie-in, but you know, it's timed because of Dune.
2650760	2653320	It's a tie-in to the Dune movie, although not officially.
2653320	2656760	So they did the sandworm expedition right when the Dune movie released.
2656760	2659560	So, um, not tremors, but close.
2659560	2663240	So, uh, I, I think anyway, obviously they're not going to confirm or deny that,
2663240	2665560	but it is a very interesting coincidence for sure.
2665560	2668520	So, um, that is, that is what's going on in No Man's Sky.
2669080	2669560	All right.
2669560	2671480	Um, that's it for our gaming weeks.
2671480	2674600	I don't have any show schedule updates to really get out there.
2674600	2677800	Uh, as far as I know, we're not having any shows off in the future.
2677800	2678760	So let's move on.
2678760	2680280	We still need to schedule.
2680280	2683880	You guys did meet the point reward for Orange Lounge Fudio.
2683880	2686520	I just need to pin down a date with my co-host for that to happen.
2686520	2687480	So we'll work on that.
2687480	2691000	It will be sometime this month, just in time for Thanksgiving.
2691000	2691800	All right.
2691800	2697400	In the meantime, let's get into some, uh, gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight
2697400	2702440	with, uh, kind of the company that has been a reoccurring headline in the last few months.
2703000	2703320	Yeah.
2703320	2704680	So Activision Blizzard.
2704680	2710840	So the announcement that Jen O'Neill, who was one of the, uh, I'm not exactly sure what
2710840	2712200	position she had.
2712200	2716440	She was, um, I guess one of the top positions in Blizzard.
2716440	2720360	And that was kind of a big deal because, you know, female in a top position at a company
2720360	2726360	that's has, uh, see allegedly very misogynistic, uh, tendencies.
2726360	2730760	Uh, she is stepping down, uh, immediately, or at least I used to say at the end of the
2730760	2736920	year, she will be stepping down and Mike Ybarra is going to be taking over, um, those
2736920	2737800	duties as well.
2738440	2741320	And, you know, basically, of course, a dude.
2741320	2741640	Yeah.
2741640	2746200	According to the ABK Alliance, you know, they said, this is a sad moment for many of us
2746200	2750920	at ABK who are very excited to have a new experience, uh, with women of color heading
2750920	2751720	our company.
2751720	2757480	We found out during our shareholder meeting and wish Jen well in her future endeavors.
2757480	2760200	Um, along with that as well.
2760200	2764600	And I'm not sure if this is related to the drama, but, uh, apparently Overwatch two and
2764600	2767480	Diablo four have been delayed to 2023.
2767480	2773640	They're still, uh, planning to deliver substantial amounts of content, uh, from Blizzard next
2773640	2778120	year, but, uh, now playing later launches for those two games.
2778120	2780360	Define substantial.
2780360	2783480	I'm going to guess the Diablo mobile game, I think is finally going to line.
2783480	2787400	I think they've said it's going to launch early 2022, but beyond that question mark,
2788040	2790120	um, I don't know.
2790120	2795320	And maybe a Hearthstone expansion or something, but it's, it's, I don't think substantial
2795320	2797320	is an interesting word for them to use now.
2797320	2801480	And this chance we're going to get so many candy crush updates.
2801480	2803480	This plays into what I said last week.
2803480	2807160	I know you weren't here, Loki, but, um, you certainly heard about the virtual Blizzcon
2807160	2808920	getting canceled early next year.
2808920	2811320	And I said there, what do they have to show?
2811960	2815080	They have games that they shown already.
2815080	2818360	And if they want to give an update on Overwatch two, they'll just drop a trailer out of nowhere
2818360	2818920	on us.
2818920	2819720	You know what I mean?
2819720	2824760	And so I, I, and now, now of course, a week later, we hear the games get delayed another,
2824760	2827000	you know, which again, okay.
2827000	2828120	I'm, I'm of two minds.
2828120	2830120	And I said this last week and I'm sorry to repeat myself.
2830120	2831640	I'm of two minds of this.
2831640	2832200	Yes.
2832200	2836200	I understand the great Miyamoto and I agree with this and I understand the great quote
2836200	2838680	that we always say everybody always fucking says with delays.
2839480	2839980	Yes.
2840280	2843400	A good game is always good, but a bad game is forever bad.
2843400	2845800	And no one will remember that you delayed a game, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2845800	2846520	We all know that.
2846520	2846840	Yes.
2846840	2847800	I do agree with that.
2847800	2849080	However, guess what?
2849080	2850680	No game makes no money.
2851640	2857240	And Blizzard is in, is really in a circumstance here, especially with wow, losing the players
2857240	2858280	that they've been losing.
2858280	2862760	Like, wow has, or Blizzard has got to figure out how to get these games out faster.
2863720	2864840	They really do.
2864840	2870040	I, I, and I, I don't understand how like a new call of duty game will be all hands on
2870040	2873640	fucking deck around Activision, but Overwatch won't.
2874280	2876520	And yes, before somebody in chat, corrects me.
2876520	2876760	Yes.
2876760	2878920	Call of duty sells buku millions billions.
2879480	2879720	Yes.
2879720	2883320	That is the very clear reason why it is all hands on deck for a call of duty game.
2883320	2887320	Why can't it be some hands on deck for Overwatch though?
2887320	2891480	You know, to try to, and look, I get there's a certain level of quality we expect.
2891480	2892040	Yes.
2892040	2900280	That can all be true with the right oversight of the game, but like Blizzard has got to
2900280	2900840	step on it.
2901480	2907080	And all these, all these people, like the Overwatch guy leaving the Diablo guy leaving
2907080	2909720	Jen O'Neill now leaving isn't helping.
2909720	2912120	It's not helping the speed situation.
2912120	2914840	Like Blizzard needs new leadership.
2915800	2916840	Mikey Barra.
2916840	2917640	Okay, cool.
2917640	2919720	Like he did a lot of good stuff with Microsoft.
2919720	2920760	Let's see what he's got.
2920760	2922200	I'm not going to discount him.
2922200	2926440	Let's see if he, you know, has it in him to fix what's going on with Blizzard.
2926440	2929240	You know, but I also kind of think he can't do it alone.
2929240	2931720	I don't necessarily mean he needs a co-chair.
2931720	2936760	I thought it was nice, but he probably doesn't need one, but, um, he's going to need support
2936760	2938840	all the way from the top at Activision for sure.
2939880	2944440	Anyway, um, Mike Defton chat says the thing here, Rob, with all the people that left over
2944440	2948600	the past six months, how can they work on a game without any sort of leadership or management?
2948600	2955320	And honestly, it is somebody has got to come in and clean up the rodeo and get it going
2955320	2955720	fast.
2956840	2962280	I Mikey Barra has a big job ahead of a big Jen O'Neill did too, but she found an option
2962280	2965640	that worked better for her at the same time for her professional growth.
2965640	2966280	Good for her.
2967560	2972200	Is anyone going to fault her for leaving Blizzard to, what does it start her own charity or
2972200	2976520	work on this board of this charity or whatever it is that supports the wider picture of supporting
2976520	2977240	women in gaming?
2977240	2978280	Am I getting that all correct?
2978680	2983560	Is her reasons for leaving who's going to fault her for that, but somebody's still got
2983560	2984760	to come in and clean up the mess.
2988840	2989320	I don't know.
2989320	2990760	It's, it's, it's just sad.
2990760	2999640	I do feel like the big card, the T card that Blizzard might have in their pocket for 2022.
3000360	3005080	And I, I, I'm going to say it now is this, I think absolutely this has to happen whether
3005080	3005960	it's a mess or not.
3006520	3009400	They're going to drop wrath of the Lich King classic.
3009400	3009720	Wow.
3010600	3011480	Absolutely.
3011480	3014680	Because that was the peak of world of Warcraft.
3015400	3019720	And I do feel like there are people that will go, go back to world of Warcraft specifically
3019720	3021000	for that expansion.
3021800	3026520	I don't think it'll be nearly as many as played while in the Heyday, but that's, that's the
3026520	3031880	T card that Blizzard has in their back pocket that I do think they will drop in 2022 when
3031880	3033560	that probably wasn't in their original plan.
3034520	3036360	Anyway, yeah.
3036360	3038440	S2-100 Matt says lost Vikings.
3038440	3040040	Ooh, a new lost Vikings project.
3040040	3041080	Wouldn't that be fabulous?
3042440	3043480	I think that would be great.
3044440	3046360	It'd be nice, but would it happen?
3047000	3047800	Probably not.
3047800	3053240	It is a little niche at this point, unless, you know, Blizzard, whoever can put a really
3053240	3054680	shiny coat of paint on it.
3054680	3059480	The other card that Blizzard has in their back pocket, Vicarious Visions.
3060120	3062360	They did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.
3062360	3068360	Honestly, the, the only problem with the Diablo 2 remaster is that it was, it was, it was
3068360	3069400	Diablo 2.
3069400	3073400	It was, that's not a bad, hold on before you put your pitchworks and torches down.
3073400	3075080	Diablo 2 is a great game.
3075080	3079320	It is a monumental game in gaming history, but it's an old game and there's a lot of
3079320	3082760	quality of life things that have changed a lot in the industry and with those types of
3082760	3083800	games since then.
3083800	3087880	And it's a little hard sometimes to go back to that old way with Diablo 2.
3088760	3092840	Otherwise, Vicarious Visions did a really good job with the Diablo 2 remaster.
3092840	3099640	So the big question mark, what is Vicarious Visions working on now?
3101640	3102760	Is it another remaster?
3102760	3106760	And that was the studio that Jen O'Neill had, that was her studio.
3106760	3107960	That's where she was pulled from.
3108520	3111640	What is the game that they are working on?
3112440	3115480	And if anybody's doing a Lost Vikings remake justice,
3118520	3120760	them, but we'll see.
3120760	3125240	But I think that is the big question that we have to figure out to see if there really
3125240	3128280	are monumental Blizzard releases coming this year.
3128280	3130520	What is Vicarious Visions working on?
3130520	3132360	That is the $50,000 question.
3133960	3134520	Moving on.
3135640	3139480	Let's talk about another studio that's having a lot of problems, um, internally.
3139560	3144360	And it's one that, admittedly, we probably haven't shown the spotlight on enough.
3144360	3150200	Because, you know, just looking at the games that we tend to talk about here on OLR, we
3150200	3154040	collectively, as the hosts, have probably spent more time playing the World of Warcraft,
3154040	3159400	the Overwatches, the Diablos than we have the Far Cry's, the Assassin's Creed.
3159400	3162520	Not to say we don't play those games, just not as many hours spent on them.
3162520	3165160	I used to play Far Cry, just not, you know.
3165960	3167080	But did you hear what I said?
3167080	3168680	Not as many hours, right?
3168680	3170120	Collectively, between the three of us.
3170120	3174440	So we don't often shine the light on Ubisoft.
3175080	3181080	Well, how about, I think one a lot of people, the Super Mario Rayman Rabbids, the tech game
3181080	3182840	that that was, I can't, why can't I remember the name?
3182840	3185880	Mario vs. Rabbids, Mario Rabbids, that whole thing.
3185880	3186680	That's Ubisoft.
3186680	3192680	Anyway, the point is, I've been sitting here on the show going, it has been X number of
3192680	3195480	days since the ABK letter's been responded to.
3195480	3201800	What I have failed to highlight, and I'm sorry, is that the Ubisoft letter has also gone unresponded
3201800	3206280	to, and as of the taping of tonight's show, still has.
3206280	3213000	In fact, it has been 100 days as of November 5th, so today would be day 102.
3213000	3218360	At Twitter account, A Better Ubisoft, very familiar to what we saw with A Better ABK,
3218360	3223800	A Better Ubisoft tweeted, 100 days ago, we signed our open letter and set our four key
3223800	3224680	demands.
3224680	3226600	None of our demands have been met.
3226600	3232520	So today, we're launching a new petition open for all of our supporters to sign, and it
3232520	3238200	is basically targeted right at Yves Guillemin in another tweet saying, you disappoint us.
3239240	3241400	100 days, zero demands met.
3241400	3243080	Surely you can do better than this.
3244440	3250680	Interesting, the phrasing is right out of those Far Cry 6 emails that were sent to all
3250680	3253800	the people that were playing that game and then kind of like abandoned it for a few days.
3253800	3257240	They got those emails out of the blue that were like, you disappoint me, you, but it's
3257240	3258600	like from the villain in the game.
3258600	3261160	Oh, clever, clever, clever.
3261160	3264120	They really like spamming you if you don't play their stupid game.
3264120	3267160	Oh yeah, this is a whole big thing because it led into a discussion about how the games
3267160	3272600	track your play and all this, but you, you, when you click the agreed all those terms
3272600	3276120	and conditions for you play or whatever it's called, guess what?
3276120	3277400	You told them they could email you.
3278280	3280600	So that's why people are getting emails.
3281320	3284760	Yeah, but don't, there's also other ways of getting the emails blocked.
3285720	3290040	Oh yeah, oh yeah, if I got one of those emails, I just report a spam, done.
3290600	3293720	The Gmail filters are pretty good on that as are most email systems.
3295160	3298840	As a reminder, the four, a better Ubisoft key demands.
3298840	3302760	Number one, stop promoting and moving note offenders from studio to studio.
3302760	3304360	Team to team with no repercussions.
3304360	3305480	The cycle needs to end.
3305480	3310360	Number two, we want a collective seat at the table to have a meaningful say in how Ubisoft
3310360	3312200	as a company moves forward from here.
3312200	3318280	Number three, cross industry collaboration to agree on a set of ground rules and processes
3318280	3321880	that all studios can use to handle these offenses in the future.
3321880	3327000	Number four, this collaboration must heavily involve employees in non-management positions
3327000	3329080	and union representatives.
3329880	3332280	What here is so fucking crazy?
3332280	3338520	They're like, honestly, these are, these are really, this bar is very low.
3339320	3339560	Yeah.
3340200	3343880	In my opinion, number five, in my opinion, underlined bolded,
3343880	3347240	number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.
3348680	3351080	Yeah, but absolutely.
3351080	3352280	They're not going to go there.
3352280	3353960	Certainly the employees aren't going to go there.
3353960	3354920	I will go there.
3354920	3357720	Number five should be the resignation of Yves Guillemin.
3357720	3360760	Why not give Jay Allard a call?
3360760	3361800	Why don't you see how he's doing?
3363160	3365400	Run a company like shit, get a shitty result.
3366520	3367020	Totally.
3369960	3374520	The petition is quite simply, I support, it's a Google doc.
3374520	3375720	So that's why it's a little tricky.
3375720	3379160	I can't just give you the URL, but I can give you the link to the Twitter account,
3379160	3380120	A Better Ubisoft.
3381000	3384040	100 days since our open letter and none of our demands have been met.
3384040	3387560	This new petition is open to everyone who supports a better Ubisoft campaign.
3387560	3392040	Please add your name, show your support of at A Better Ubisoft on Twitter and share this link.
3392120	3395160	I will fill this out on the show right now
3395880	3401000	and say from all of us at the world's longest running video game podcast, Orange Lounge Radio.
3402680	3404520	But of course we should all sign individually as well,
3404520	3408520	but I'm going to go ahead and sign it from your friends at Orange Lounge Radio
3408520	3412360	and our thoughts to those employees at Ubisoft,
3412360	3416360	who I don't think are asking for anything unrealistic by having a seat at the table.
3416360	3419800	SHJ 100 Matt in chat says,
3420760	3422600	why does Yves Guillemin still have a job?
3422600	3423480	It's baffling to me.
3423480	3424200	He's still there.
3424200	3425560	It all happened on his watch.
3425560	3427240	Everyone else got let go except him.
3427240	3430520	I understand he's the co-founder CEO, but why isn't the board pressing anything?
3431320	3431880	Because men.
3434520	3438280	I don't, I do not have an answer outside of what Dark Soccer just said.
3439400	3440600	There is no answer.
3440600	3441640	There is no spoon.
3441640	3443720	There is no, there is nothing.
3446840	3448040	It doesn't make sense.
3448040	3448540	Resign.
3449480	3450280	Bitch.
3450280	3450680	All right.
3451400	3452360	Because he's got a dick.
3453960	3454920	I mean, I'm sorry.
3454920	3457240	It's, and I'm not, okay.
3457240	3459880	For anyone who thinks, I'm laughing at Twitch, not you, sorry.
3460520	3464120	For anyone who thinks that calling something out like that is misandry,
3464120	3469800	you can, first of all, take your tiny little brain, vomit it, and then shove it back up your ass.
3471000	3474120	Number two, this is the way that the world is.
3474120	3474920	I am not wrong.
3477320	3477800	Just saying.
3478600	3480520	The comment that made me laugh on Twitch,
3481400	3486440	SSG100Matt says, sign up from that Catholic school that tagged OLR in that random tweet.
3486440	3487080	We get tagged.
3487080	3489480	Go check out OLR's Twitter.
3489480	3491480	We get tagged in the, okay, look, we're very lucky.
3491480	3492840	We've been on Twitter so fucking long.
3492840	3494360	The show's existed so fucking long.
3494360	3496280	We have a three letter Twitter name.
3496280	3498760	You actually can't get those anymore.
3498760	3501800	My old Twitter name used to be Skye, S-K-I-E.
3501800	3503560	You, I can't get it back.
3503560	3504600	Even if I wanted to.
3504600	3508920	I don't because I now, I don't really go by Skye online anymore.
3508920	3513320	My brand quote unquote is Rob Roberts or on Twitter because the spammer got it.
3513320	3514440	Mr. Rob Roberts.
3514440	3515640	So follow, plug plug.
3517640	3523880	But you can't get a Twitter name with less than four characters at this point anymore.
3523880	3527240	So the fact that we're sitting on OLR, number one, is a gold mine anyway.
3527240	3532040	But number two, we get like, there's all sorts of, I guess there's some fucking school out there
3532040	3536200	that's OLR because we were getting tagged in like bullshit referee.
3536200	3538600	Just go look at twitter.com slash OLR.
3538600	3539080	It's weird.
3539080	3542840	And I actually, I replied to it and I quote tweeted it and I said, ma'am, this is a podcast.
3545080	3547160	I thought it was funny anyway.
3547880	3548380	All right.
3549800	3551640	Oh, did they say they took it down?
3551640	3552440	Really?
3552440	3552920	Hold on.
3552920	3553080	Yeah.
3553080	3554120	I was deleted.
3554120	3556440	They deleted the tweet after I quote tweeted.
3557000	3557480	Victory.
3557480	3587480	Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh du
3587480	3617480	duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
3617480	3623640	There was an OMGITSROB2, but there wasn't just an OMGITSROB, and I was like, I'll take it, yoink.
3623640	3626440	Somebody-
3626440	3629400	Maybe then that means that there was one and it was deleted.
3629400	3630200	Probably.
3630200	3631240	After that one was made.
3631240	3636280	I wish the Rob Roberts account would get deleted so I could get it, but unfortunately, there's me,
3636280	3641880	there's apparently some politician in the UK who kind of sounds like an ass,
3642520	3648120	there's some DJ in Australia, New Zealand, and there is some rugby player.
3648120	3649640	All of us named Rob Roberts.
3649640	3653720	So it will be a fight to who gets that name first once the spammer disappears.
3654840	3655640	Fingers crossed.
3656360	3657400	It should be me, damn it.
3657400	3658520	I've been on Twitter the longest.
3659080	3659880	All right.
3659880	3660520	Anyway, moving on.
3660520	3665160	I'm sorry, we derailed a long way from a very serious topic, but I do want to re-emphasize,
3665160	3669560	speaking of Twitter, check out what's going on with a better Ubisoft and latest updates
3669560	3671480	and resign iskimam.
3671480	3672040	Let's move on.
3672040	3673800	Let's try to get some happy news, Dark Sakura.
3675320	3682440	So a game called Tetris the Grandmaster is getting a home port.
3684760	3688680	And then they said it was going to be delayed.
3690520	3697240	So they announced the port by announcing that the announcement has been delayed.
3698840	3700040	Does that make sense?
3700120	3703240	Yes, this game is coming out eventually.
3703880	3710120	This is the same arcade version from 1998, which was considered one of the best ones
3710120	3713960	and is often used for speed runs and competition.
3716360	3721640	And of course, there were other sequels like Tetris, the absolute Grandmaster two plus
3721640	3724600	and Tetris, the Grandmaster three terror instinct.
3724600	3727240	What's terror about Tetris, please?
3727240	3727740	Thank you.
3728380	3733340	Um, but this tweet is actually, hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read it.
3733340	3733840	Okay.
3735100	3740300	The announcement about the TGM series for home use, which was scheduled for today, has
3740300	3743740	not been released yet due to the reasons other than Arika.
3743740	3745180	I guess that's the company.
3745180	3745820	Yes, company.
3746700	3753020	In addition, although it is a new TGM work that is under consideration separately, there
3753020	3759100	is a request from the licenser side that I want you to make the case success as a condition.
3759100	3760460	So it is very legitimate.
3760460	3761660	It's, it's bad translation.
3763020	3765660	But basically it means this is, this is real.
3765660	3768460	It is a real game, but we're not supposed to announce it yet.
3769900	3770400	Wild.
3771260	3773740	I think they just worked around being told not to announce it.
3774620	3775120	Interesting.
3776220	3779580	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I don't know if he'll be at games on quick, but talking to
3779660	3780700	our old friend, Kevin.
3780700	3781200	Yes.
3781580	3783900	One of our listeners who used to go by Kevin DDR.
3783900	3785180	I don't think he goes by that anymore.
3785180	3790540	I think he changed his branding, but, um, he is very well known for doing Tetris at
3790540	3791340	games done quick.
3791340	3793340	He listened to this show back in the day.
3793340	3796860	I don't know if he still does, but hello, if you're listening, um, and has done some
3796860	3800300	very impressive tech, like he did Tetris blindfolded this game.
3800300	3801580	If I remember right.
3801580	3805820	Well, no, that can't be possible because you have to know what he did.
3805820	3807980	There was something wild he did with this game.
3807980	3810620	I remember somebody in chat remind me what it was.
3810620	3813420	Um, but anyway, the full comment, Dr.
3813420	3817100	Tetsuya said is that from talking to our old friend, he's thinking this is a compilation
3817100	3820620	of the three, uh, TGM arcade games.
3820620	3821820	So it might be like a compilation.
3821820	3822860	That'd be really cool.
3822860	3826380	Uh, and you know, the switch has been getting a lot of like arcade ports.
3826380	3828380	You know, we talked about it again last week.
3828380	3830380	Um, the whole series of the.
3831260	3832060	Oh my God, what?
3832060	3835900	Arcade archives and you know, the console archives and that whole news arcade archives.
3835900	3838060	There's been a lot of arcade ports on switch.
3838060	3842860	Not that this is falling into that same, um, branding, but it is, you know, very interesting.
3842860	3843420	Uh, and Dr.
3843420	3846860	Tetsuya says he made grand master, which is not an easy feat at all.
3848140	3849260	So that's really cool.
3849260	3850380	Well, congratulations.
3850380	3852780	Um, I I'm I'll check this game out.
3852780	3859340	Oh, the other thing, um, that is like a neat, uh, apparently Tetris 99 is by that Akira
3859340	3861260	company, although they kind of did it in a partnership.
3862220	3866780	Arika did this in partnership with, uh, Nintendo, the Tetris 99.
3866780	3869580	So a lot of people have already played that style of Tetris.
3869580	3873340	But I think, I think it's neat that there's room for all of this Tetris,
3873340	3875260	because you can look at Tetris 99.
3875260	3879180	You can look at Tetris effect and you can look at Tetris, the grand master and go,
3879180	3880860	these are all great Tetris games.
3881580	3884700	And then you can look at what gelico did on the PlayStation with that Tetris release and
3884700	3886380	go, that is a shit Tetris game.
3886380	3887340	But anyway, I digress.
3888460	3890140	I don't know if he ever played Tetris on PlayStation.
3890140	3891260	It was horrible.
3892460	3892960	All right.
3893660	3895260	I play one Tetris.
3895260	3895580	Sorry.
3895580	3898060	Two Tetris is two, two only to Tetra.
3900220	3901020	Tetris sees.
3901660	3903500	I don't know what the, the plural would be.
3903500	3904220	What are the two?
3905420	3907980	It's the nest one and the game boy win.
3907980	3908220	Yep.
3908220	3909420	Those, those are good ones.
3909420	3910700	Uh, Tetranet.
3912140	3912380	Yeah.
3912380	3913500	Tetranet was great.
3913500	3914700	I miss Tetranet.
3914700	3915260	Yeah.
3915260	3917100	It was a little throwback to Tetranet.
3917100	3919180	I don't know how much of that exists.
3919180	3920940	We need a Tetranet stream.
3920940	3921420	Oh my God.
3921420	3922620	Is Tetranet still a thing?
3924380	3925260	I have no idea.
3925260	3925760	Okay.
3926780	3930140	Maybe I I'm going to put my foot in my mouth, but I'm saying it anyway.
3930140	3930640	Next.
3931420	3933660	O L R or I'm sorry.
3933660	3936540	Next vog point redeem thing.
3936540	3937420	Tetranet night.
3938940	3940220	I'm so in for that.
3940220	3940780	Dark soccer.
3940780	3941980	Would you do a Tetranet night?
3943500	3945420	If I can get it to run on this for sure.
3945420	3946460	If we can play it.
3946460	3947180	Sure.
3947180	3947500	All right.
3948540	3948860	All right.
3948940	3949420	Moving on.
3949420	3951260	Uh, let's go onto our next story.
3951260	3951760	Loki.
3953020	3953180	Yeah.
3953180	3960460	So apparently there was some game that's being developed by, uh, the folks behind,
3961420	3963180	uh, the mafia three series.
3963180	3971660	And so hanger 13 was working on this ambitious, I guess, new IP for take two.
3971660	3975340	And fortunately it's been canceled.
3975980	3981980	So hanger 13's latest project, um, when they pursue new intellectual properties,
3981980	3985580	we occasionally may encounter situations that call for cancellation.
3985580	3989020	We encourage our teams to pursue their passions and take creative risks,
3989020	3990700	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3990700	3991980	Um, they didn't do it.
3991980	3995820	So, uh, not sure what it was going to be.
3995820	4001020	The game went by a code name volt or Voltron.
4001100	4006940	So, um, maybe something similar to like Anthem, something like that.
4006940	4010940	Maybe we can speculate all day, but I'll tell you what we'll do.
4010940	4018300	We'll just wait a good five, 10 years or so when somehow a working build of this game
4018300	4022620	leaks out into the public, you know, and we'll figure it out then.
4024220	4024620	Kitty.
4025660	4026540	It's a midnight.
4026540	4031660	Oh, I have grabbed her against her will.
4032860	4034140	What do you have to say about that boo?
4035580	4037740	Smoosh never comes in here during the show.
4037740	4041180	I guess he just yells at you from across the house.
4041180	4041660	He did.
4041660	4046140	When we were all in person, he would, because he was like, oh, new people.
4046140	4049500	Oh, anti Jamie, you know, he would do, he would do those types of things.
4049500	4049900	Yeah.
4049900	4052460	So, but now it's just like, oh, I see that guy all the time.
4052460	4053900	I'm not going to go over there.
4053900	4059100	So anyway, we have a cat in the neighborhood named blue.
4059100	4061180	She is a gray short-haired cat.
4062300	4065660	She now knows that I work from home.
4065660	4069260	And if we leave the door, the front door, we have a screen door in the front door.
4069260	4075260	Or if I leave the side door open in the kitchen here, she will come up and meow at the door
4075260	4077260	for me to come outside to pet her belly.
4077820	4083180	Oh, and today she tried to run into the house when I was going back inside.
4083740	4086780	I'm like, nope, you can't go in there.
4086780	4087740	Congratulations.
4087740	4088620	You have another cat.
4088620	4089020	I know.
4089020	4090140	I don't know whose cat it is.
4090140	4092780	It's one of the, so one of the neighbor's cats.
4092780	4096140	She always smells like, uh, like laundry.
4096140	4097820	She always smells like laundry sheets.
4097820	4103660	And I'm not sure if that's like, uh, there are worse things a cat can smell like.
4103660	4107900	No, I bet she's cuddling up against a dryer because it's warm.
4107900	4109500	I think that might be a serious answer.
4110700	4111100	Maybe.
4111100	4112780	I don't know, but she's one of the neighbor's cats.
4113740	4114220	Knock it off.
4114940	4120140	Um, I, I found a kitty friend when I was doing, um, a walk recently during Pikmin at the park
4120140	4121900	and I was afraid I was going to make the Loki mistake.
4121900	4125420	I was petting the kitty and it's adorable, but no collar.
4125420	4128140	I couldn't see that the ear was chipped or anything like that.
4128140	4132060	And I'm like, oh God, this is probably a neighborhood cat, but like very friendly to
4132060	4132460	humans.
4132460	4134620	Most ferrules kind of hiss at the humans.
4134620	4137660	They don't really come up to a real feral.
4137660	4138300	We'll do that.
4138940	4142700	Um, a lot of people though, there's a lot of assholes out there, especially now in this
4143260	4147420	period that have adopted COVID pets and abandoned them.
4147980	4149260	And you know what those people are?
4150140	4150700	They're shit.
4152140	4154220	Anyway, we digressed.
4154780	4158140	It's always back to cats, but that's why, but we digress from the big budget game that
4158140	4158700	got canceled.
4158700	4160700	So this is a $53 million project.
4160700	4161500	Take two canceled.
4161500	4162300	Yeah, that is.
4163900	4164400	Wow.
4164940	4170060	You know, I, you know what I'm reminded of funny enough, blizzard, blizzard cancel.
4170060	4172060	And I can't remember the name of the game.
4172060	4174220	Now somebody in chat might remember it was a pro.
4174220	4175740	Well, they never announced the game.
4175740	4177420	It was always project.
4177420	4180060	It was project Atlas.
4180060	4185180	I don't, I don't remember the name of it, but it was like, it was a huge thing that they
4185180	4186220	were undertaking.
4186220	4193900	Well, the point is Overwatch was born of that because it was supposed to be, I guess I,
4193900	4198220	they never really said what it was all about, but it was some type of like MMO type of thing
4198220	4203580	where like you would go into these combat areas and the combats were Overwatch.
4203580	4206540	And so what they did, they built that out into its own game.
4206540	4210860	And a lot of the characters in the original Overwatch were supposed to be for that.
4210860	4213100	Thank you, tiger client is Titan was the name of it.
4213100	4213980	It was project Titan.
4213980	4216300	Ah, yeah, that is it Titan.
4216300	4220620	And a lot of those characters that were, especially in the original Overwatch were from that project
4220620	4221500	Titan game.
4221500	4226220	So my point is because I'm sitting here going, well, that's $53 million down the fucking
4226220	4226940	drain, right?
4226940	4230540	You gotta be pissed off if you're a shareholder or you're somebody that's, you know, on the
4230540	4235660	board of this company, but maybe there's a way they can reuse some of what they built
4235660	4236540	in something else.
4236540	4239020	It just depends on what it is, which of course we don't know.
4239020	4240220	There's rumors yet.
4240220	4240460	No.
4240460	4241980	What are they going to work on?
4243340	4245100	Oh, I'm sure something else is lined up.
4245100	4246060	Grand Theft Auto six.
4246780	4247660	We need people to help.
4248620	4252860	Oh, well, Grand Theft Auto remaster, uh, Chinatown wars remaster.
4254540	4256300	What, what haven't they remastered yet?
4256300	4256620	Loki.
4256620	4257500	That's what they're going to work on.
4259500	4265100	So anyway, every master bully, everybody wants a bully remaster or a bully sequel.
4266780	4272940	That's not a terrible idea, but who knows?
4272940	4276060	I guess anything's possible, but they're, they'll probably play a coaster test.
4276060	4280300	It'll probably be like the Titan thing where we won't really figure it out until a couple
4280300	4286140	years later when either the derivative game comes out or a former employee eventually
4286140	4291500	squeals because they figure the, um, uh, the NDA doesn't apply to them anymore, even
4291500	4293260	though it technically does.
4293260	4295980	But, you know, people will squeal eventually.
4295980	4297260	It just might be a few years.
4297900	4299980	So, all right, moving on.
4300620	4301980	You got to love this headline.
4302860	4304300	Bowser pleads guilty.
4304940	4307260	Uh, and, uh, that's exactly what's going on.
4307260	4308460	Is that time?
4308460	4308700	Yep.
4308700	4309020	That's right.
4309820	4310460	They caught him.
4311020	4312460	They, they got him gals.
4312460	4312860	All right.
4313740	4319020	You've been arrested for 83 chart or you're being charged with 83 counts of kidnapping,
4319020	4325740	false imprisonment, setting fire in places where it shouldn't be.
4326460	4330940	All right, look, uh, I am not talking about Bowser, the villain and Mario.
4330940	4332540	I am not talking about Doug Bowser.
4333100	4340220	I am talking about Gary Bowser, who was in the news, uh, previously as part of team executor.
4340220	4342300	Doesn't that sound like a very Bowser sounding name?
4342380	4343020	It was a hack.
4343020	4346620	I have purchased so many of their products and I'm very disappointed.
4346620	4348780	That was selling software and heart.
4348780	4353660	I don't think you should admit that Logie, uh, software allegedly, it was research purposes.
4354460	4356220	It was, uh, research.
4357180	4362620	Well, I don't have it anymore because, or maybe I don't remember, but, um, it was, I
4362620	4368140	had a, a chipped, um, we, to be able to, um, mod stuff with that.
4368140	4371820	And then, um, never could mod anything with it too.
4371900	4374060	And then eventually they had like easier things you don't even need.
4374060	4376620	I was going to say, I didn't have a chip.
4377420	4382060	Uh, the Xbox 360 also, they did a lot of, um, repair kits.
4382060	4386220	I had gone through a lot of their repair kits for the rhetoric at death type stuff.
4386220	4389980	So that was another thing that I perused them from.
4389980	4393420	Or, and I think an actual, like, uh, I don't know.
4393420	4394940	I bought lots of things.
4394940	4400380	Well, anyway, team X executor, uh, believed that they were advocating for homebrew programs
4400380	4406220	and a consumer's right to repair their own property, which in that regard points are
4406220	4406780	made.
4406780	4411500	Um, however, the Japanese, uh, company Nintendo teamed up with the U S government.
4411500	4416620	And, uh, so you got many nations involved in, uh, uh, bringing charges against Gary
4416620	4418860	Bowser and team, uh, executor.
4418860	4425740	And, um, the court documents called them a criminal criminal enterprise that was over
4425740	4428460	a dozen individual members located around the world.
4428540	4433340	And, uh, eventually they, uh, pleaded guilty.
4433340	4440700	So you have 48 year old French national max Lauren and 51, uh, Canadian man, Gary Bowser,
4440700	4444780	who were arrested and, uh, Bowser was in the Dominican Republic.
4444780	4449580	So surely you're following all the rules when you've fled to another country that, you know,
4449580	4454380	is much smaller, but anyway, uh, he's been extradited to the United States and that's
4454380	4455100	where he's been.
4455820	4461260	And yeah, I'm glad we're going after these large criminals that clearly caused Nintendo
4461260	4463260	so much loss in money.
4464140	4468700	He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to circumvent technological measures and trafficking and
4468700	4473900	circumvention devices, which both carry maximum prison sentences of five years.
4473900	4477340	Although I would imagine if he pled guilty, he will not get that maximum sentence.
4477340	4479500	He's probably hoping for something like probation.
4479500	4480540	So we will see.
4481020	4487340	Um, let's see the FBI Raymond Duda of the FBI was quoted saying, imagine if something
4487340	4490940	you invented was stolen from you and then marketed and sold to customers around the
4490940	4491420	world.
4491420	4495820	That's exactly exactly what team ex executor was doing.
4495820	4499980	This is a perfect example of why the FBI has made the prevention of theft and intellectual
4499980	4501580	property a priority.
4501580	4506300	These arrests should send a message to would be pirates that the FBI does not consider
4506300	4507660	these crimes to be a game.
4508620	4509660	I feel like that should be said.
4510060	4512860	That's the FBI logo on a splash screen.
4512860	4513260	Thank you.
4513260	4513660	Thank you.
4513660	4519340	Boomers for like, uh, that, that wonderful, you know, no, no, it wasn't, his name wasn't
4519340	4519740	boomer.
4519740	4521900	It was Duda, I think, or I closed the window already.
4523180	4525660	Um, it's just, it's so stupid though.
4525660	4530140	Like seriously, like I get it like, yeah, mod chips and stuff, but like you could go
4530140	4532460	back to like even like PlayStation and stuff like that.
4532460	4532700	Yeah.
4532700	4538780	There's their mod chips that they had out there that you could hire a game and run it
4538780	4543020	on there, but you can also use it to play stuff from other regions.
4543020	4546940	Or although I think that, you know, honestly though, I think the systems are region free
4546940	4551180	for at least like some of the more modern systems, but there are other applications
4551180	4552780	playing modded games.
4552780	4556460	For example, I did a lot of modded grand theft auto.
4556460	4561980	I didn't necessarily have, um, executed products when it came to running that stuff.
4561980	4567420	That was just, you know, hard drive or a district flashes, but you know, we played a lot of
4567420	4570620	modded stuff with it and no harm to other people.
4570620	4577100	Cause I owned like, you know, my copy of grand theft auto four at the time, but I don't
4577100	4577260	know.
4577260	4579820	I think it's stupid to go after these mod chip creators.
4579820	4581820	It's not like it's destroying this console.
4582700	4588940	I think it's a whole different situation now than like, say it was a long time ago.
4588940	4592220	So I think now it's just really easy and convenient to buy games.
4593660	4594140	Yep.
4594140	4594620	I don't know.
4595980	4596460	All right.
4596460	4602700	Or I mean, or let's put it this way now, like they're almost out of the market anyways,
4602700	4606780	because it probably even easier to emulate some of these systems before it is to, you
4606780	4609820	know, like we talked about like the switch emulation and stuff like that.
4609820	4614940	It's like, well, Oh, darn, I can't, you know, I can't mod my switch now.
4614940	4619020	I guess I'll just have to emulate it on PC instead and get around all of those problems.
4620780	4621180	All right.
4621180	4621660	Stupid.
4622300	4623100	Let's move on.
4623100	4627020	Like they're built, creating this circumstance all on their own.
4627020	4628620	And it's also Nintendo.
4628620	4632140	It's just Nintendo is just the wrong take on so many things.
4633580	4633980	All right.
4633980	4638940	Let's move on to another sort of mod and questionable usage of IP, right?
4638940	4639580	Dark soccer.
4639580	4642380	I guess it's more parodying.
4642380	4643900	Defend this in just a second.
4643900	4647500	Let dark soccer talk about our next story.
4647500	4648140	Next story.
4649740	4650460	Oh, nevermind.
4650460	4651580	Cause I forgot to bring it up.
4651580	4652300	That was my bad.
4653980	4657340	So there is a clone out there.
4658940	4661260	No, this actually, okay, there we go.
4661260	4661660	Sorry.
4661660	4663580	For some reason it kept opening the wrong article.
4665100	4674860	There is a game out there that is a clone based off of squid game.
4676380	4677580	It's legally distinct.
4678300	4679580	It is legally distinct.
4681020	4682460	It is inspired by it.
4682460	4685180	I should say an offered up for free on steam.
4685180	4686540	It's called crab game.
4687500	4696540	And it has like different, the different childhood games where you have to basically
4696540	4700620	do them or die or do them well and die or die.
4701340	4704140	Like the floor is lava or red light, green light.
4705180	4709260	And I don't know how to feel about this, but I want it.
4709740	4711660	Loki clearly has feelings.
4711660	4718540	This is created by a guy that goes by Danny on, uh, he's a YouTuber and unity developer.
4718540	4721340	And he's been making games for a very long time.
4721340	4723020	He's very entertaining to watch.
4723020	4724060	He has another game out.
4724060	4727020	That's very popular on steam right now called muck, which is kind of a.
4727580	4733500	Survival type game, not, not in Minecraft per se, but it's just like a survival game.
4733500	4734940	It's just ridiculous.
4734940	4738940	But this, yeah, obviously it is definitely based on
4739980	4746460	the gameplay of say squid game, but he's taken it to like another level where he's added a
4746460	4748940	bunch of unique games into it as well.
4748940	4755740	And, um, different spins on the games that were in the actual show.
4755740	4761100	And I'm saying, I'm saying a lot of this, a lot of my talk is very tongue in cheek because
4761100	4763260	I mean the squid game stuff and you're right.
4763260	4765660	It's all based on childhood games anyway.
4765660	4768300	So a lot of this stuff is showing up everywhere.
4768300	4770300	Ironically back on in childhood.
4770300	4773980	So when kids really shouldn't be watching squid game, but I get, of course they are
4773980	4774620	anyway.
4774620	4776460	And so they're playing Roblox and stuff.
4776460	4777500	Who does their job anymore?
4777500	4777740	Right?
4777740	4778060	Yeah.
4778060	4779820	Who is supposed to be a babysitter?
4779820	4780620	Who cares?
4780620	4780940	Yeah.
4780940	4785020	So they're playing red light, green light, but I guess when they lose, they get shot
4785020	4786140	with a nerf gun or something.
4786140	4788380	I don't know, but that's what kids do on playgrounds now.
4788380	4792220	So it is, it's not surprising that of course it makes its way to video games, of course.
4792220	4795740	And again, it's a, I mean, it's basically fall guys, right?
4795980	4798860	I mean, fog and fall guys was before the squid game phenomenon.
4798860	4801500	Isn't that basically the same thing in a way?
4801500	4803100	I mean, obviously no.
4803100	4805340	Yes, the games are different, but not that different.
4806140	4806380	Yeah.
4806380	4807180	It's kind of fun.
4807180	4809340	I think it's really popular because it's free.
4809900	4810860	Um, true.
4811980	4812460	Honestly.
4812460	4816620	Well, he kind of expanded it in the way, like he wanted to take other, like if squid game
4816620	4818300	were made in the U S type of thing.
4818300	4825340	So he has a bunch of like, you know, us games like tag or they have like hide and seek bomb
4825980	4830620	tags on a thing, but like, they have a game that's sort of like not necessarily splatoon,
4830620	4834940	but it's kind of like, you know, you have to touch panels on the wall and the floor
4834940	4836220	and they change to your color.
4836220	4839500	And, um, of course then there's the red, like green.
4839500	4844140	Let me tell you, let me tell you a game dark soccer and I never shut up about dead by daylight
4844140	4846620	is basically hide and seek and I'm terrible at it.
4848700	4853420	So it's a little bit more involved, but yeah, it does have some tags, especially the way
4853420	4855500	these, especially the way people playing it today.
4855500	4857660	My God, it has some tag elements.
4858860	4859100	Yeah.
4859100	4860620	So it looks fun.
4860620	4865740	It's also, you know, it's, it's popular because, you know, we have everybody streaming it now
4865740	4868860	cause everybody wants to get on that like squid game hype.
4868860	4873580	And now there's like a free to play game that kind of captures that.
4873580	4877260	So everybody's just, I mean, everybody's doing squid game stuff now.
4877260	4878460	It's just, that's, what's popular.
4878460	4883260	They just did a big thing with the Minecraft, uh, Minecraft streamers, like 200, you know,
4884140	4884940	streamers and stuff.
4884940	4887740	And they were doing a squid game in Minecraft.
4887740	4889340	And then they have the crab game stuff.
4889340	4890220	You have dream.
4890220	4893100	Who's a Minecraft streamer also playing crab game.
4893100	4893980	Just like it.
4893980	4897260	It's just insanely popular and it's free to play.
4897260	4900380	So poor Danny's not getting any, any cash though, from it.
4901260	4903980	Make sure you go wishlist, uh, Carlson instead.
4903980	4908140	His, his actual paid game, put ads in that game, buddy, make that coin.
4908140	4908780	You earned it.
4909340	4914860	So ma well, maybe he's worried about Netflix, but it's, it sounds like it's super derivative
4914860	4917740	enough that it's not, not even close.
4917740	4921820	There was that story tonight, uh, on Bobby's show, or at least I remember him referencing
4921820	4926220	it about that squid game thing that had the NFTs that they were selling like NFTs, the
4926220	4926460	carrot.
4926460	4928300	Now that is some bullshittery.
4928300	4931580	And that's the type of stuff that, you know, it did get shut down.
4931580	4934060	Didn't they, didn't they steal like $3 million?
4934060	4934940	They rug pulled.
4934940	4935180	Yeah.
4935180	4937180	That's the thing with, and it's not NFTs.
4937180	4938540	It's like a crypto coin.
4938540	4944700	So these like, um, trash coins or whatever that you will, if, if you hear about these
4944700	4948300	new cryptos, it's like, and they, it's more times than not.
4948300	4952540	It's just rug pulls where you get a bunch of people hyped up and you get them invested
4952540	4952780	in it.
4952780	4956380	And then the person that creates the coin takes all the money and leaves, and then the
4956380	4957260	coins worth them.
4957260	4962700	If those D bags can take 3.4 million from squid game fans, then what's the guy's name
4962700	4963980	that created this crab game?
4963980	4966140	Danny, Danny, Danny.
4967100	4971580	He's can put some quick five, five second, 10 second ads in his game and make that coin.
4971580	4972140	He deserves it.
4972780	4973500	He really should.
4973500	4974460	And also play mock.
4974460	4975900	Mock is really fun too.
4975900	4977500	It's also insanely hard.
4977500	4977820	All right.
4978700	4980060	You got a lot of great games, actually.
4981180	4983900	DJ says the squid game memes are hilarious.
4983900	4989660	A lot of them are, but, um, yeah, I mean, I guess it was this game, a meme of some sort,
4989660	4989980	maybe.
4989980	4990860	I don't know.
4990860	4991180	All right.
4991180	4994940	Well, a lot of the game has memes from his other games as well.
4994940	4997660	Like there's a whole bunch of watches.
4997660	5002300	You have to like, like the red light, green light person, the model that they created
5002300	5003420	has his face on it.
5004060	5005340	It's just like stretched.
5005340	5006540	It just looks weird.
5006540	5009420	But like, it's, it's just silly and it's free.
5011020	5011820	It's just fun.
5011820	5012460	I don't know.
5012460	5013180	I'll check it out.
5013980	5014540	Let's move on.
5015180	5016060	Who's got our next story?
5016060	5016560	Logie?
5017500	5019500	Yeah, so this is really cool, actually.
5019500	5024300	So there's a brand new feature that's coming to Forza Horizon 5.
5025260	5032700	That adds actual ASL and BSL sign language support to the cinematic.
5032700	5038860	So you actually have an interpreter on screen during the cinematics signing all of the dialogue
5038860	5043260	in there now, whereas some folks may use like, you know, closed captioning or something like
5043260	5043760	that.
5045500	5054380	People that may also not be able to hear and also maybe like, you know, dyslexic or whatever
5054380	5059420	the case may be, might not be able to read captions that easily.
5059420	5066140	And, you know, the sign language interpreter is much easier to, to understand.
5066140	5071580	So I think that's just like, it's extremely cool that they put that in this game and just
5071580	5074060	the accessibility features are, are insane.
5074060	5079660	This, this is the kind of shit when they talk about cloud gaming and things that are in
5079660	5080700	the cloud.
5080700	5083980	This is the kind of shit I would love to see the cloud used for.
5084380	5088940	Is that when somebody would like to have, you know, ASL, I'm assuming, I know ASL is American
5088940	5089340	sign language.
5089340	5090620	I'm assuming BSL is British.
5091660	5094700	But please correct me if I'm wrong.
5095580	5100860	But I think it'd be awesome if more games had the ability to, you know, I get it.
5100860	5102220	It's a lot of data.
5102220	5104780	They might not be able to fit it all on the disk or in the download or whatever.
5104780	5107820	But if somebody could like connect to the cloud and get some of these interpretations,
5107820	5108860	I think that's awesome.
5108860	5113820	And yeah, you brought up the great points about why captions are good in one way, but
5113820	5116940	sign language is even better for other sorts.
5116940	5120140	There's also emotion and things that you can convey.
5120140	5123420	Yes, that you can convey in sign language that you can't necessarily convey in the written
5123420	5124060	words.
5124060	5130220	If you want to see what I'm talking about and folks that can hear will absolutely notice
5130220	5130780	this as well.
5131580	5135340	Go look at somebody sign languaging a rap concert.
5135340	5137100	These videos go viral once in a while.
5137100	5139180	I'm sure they've got to be all over TikTok.
5140140	5147580	I actually want to interject on this one because my uncle is an interpreter and I know a little
5147580	5148080	ASL.
5149580	5153500	Part of actually speaking sign language is facial expression.
5153500	5158620	It is an integral part of sign language.
5159260	5166300	You have to cultivate certain emotions for certain things that, you know, facial responses
5166860	5168860	to convey the right terms across.
5168860	5172300	And don't forget, there are also different dialects of ASL.
5175100	5184700	And so it is a lot going into it, but having the face to go with it is absolutely essential
5184700	5186780	to proper communication in ASL.
5186780	5192140	Yeah, so I don't think anyone looks at this and sees it as a bad thing.
5192140	5194220	I think some people have that curiosity.
5194220	5195580	Well, don't they have closed captioning?
5195580	5196620	But now we've explained it.
5196620	5200460	There's a very big difference between the two with the emotion and everything.
5200460	5206140	And again, Google somebody signing in a rap concert or look it up on TikTok.
5206140	5210220	Share one in chat if you got a good one and you will see exactly what we're talking about.
5210860	5212860	There's a reason those videos go viral all the time.
5213740	5215260	All right, let's move on.
5215260	5215980	I don't know.
5215980	5216540	It's interesting.
5216540	5218380	I'm doing this story, not dark soccer, but that's okay.
5218380	5219420	We'll talk about Google Stadia.
5219420	5222780	And the reason I actually had clicked on that because the moment I saw Stadia, I thought
5222780	5223280	it was mine.
5223820	5224860	No, no, it wasn't.
5224860	5225900	It wasn't in your pool.
5225900	5226780	So I took it out of your pool.
5226780	5229260	I should have given it to you as that other one, but that's all right.
5229260	5234140	Anyway, what I wanted to talk about with this is that, well, you can comment to your heart's
5234140	5234780	content, please.
5234780	5235580	It's a collaborative show.
5236140	5241820	Google Stadia did start doing free trials back in October, and they're going to be adding
5241820	5242060	more.
5242060	5245740	And when I say free trials, this means you don't have to have Stadia Pro for this.
5245740	5251740	You can be a free Stadia user and you can actually get two more games you can test drive.
5251740	5257100	Control Ultimate Edition, which of course that one game of the year things up the wazoo.
5257100	5260860	And that is a freebie on Stadia Pro, just saying.
5260860	5261180	Right.
5261180	5264060	But even if you don't have Stadia Pro, you can still test run it.
5264060	5267740	Well, no, I'm just saying the difference is that as opposed to a trial without Stadia
5267740	5270060	Pro on Stadia Pro, they were giving it away for free.
5270060	5270560	Nice.
5271340	5276460	And then I believe Hello Engineer is the other one that they're doing.
5276460	5276860	Am I?
5276860	5277740	No, no.
5277740	5279660	Hello Engineer was the first one they did.
5279660	5283420	And then I'm sorry, the other game is Riders Republic from Ubisoft.
5283420	5284940	So that's pretty neat.
5284940	5286940	And the Resident Evil Village one is still up too.
5287820	5288300	Oh, cool.
5289180	5289500	Yeah.
5289500	5292860	Last I checked, I can't actually look at my phone.
5292860	5295820	And if I launch Stadia right now, Dead by Daylight will come up.
5297580	5298940	But yeah.
5299740	5305020	So if you're curious about Stadia, you know, and you want to take it for a test drive,
5305020	5308620	you have plenty of ways to do that now with these free trials and so forth.
5308620	5310700	If you're curious, how does the cloud gaming work?
5310700	5313340	I should say Microsoft's gotten more and more in this too.
5313340	5315900	You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week, because I didn't play enough
5315900	5321020	of it, but I started up the Marvel Avengers game in the cloud because you know, that game
5321020	5322140	is like 100 gig download.
5322140	5324540	I'm like, I don't have the bandwidth for that, but I want to try this.
5324540	5326780	So I started to do that first little area.
5326780	5328780	If you've played the Avengers game, you know what I'm talking about?
5328780	5332060	That first little Avenger, how do they call it?
5332060	5333580	Like the celebration.
5333580	5336220	It was half price on Steam, but still full price on Stadia.
5336860	5337360	Yeah.
5337360	5342140	So, but, but on the, um, it's on game pass, Microsoft, you can play it on the cloud through
5342140	5344540	Microsoft game pass on your console.
5344540	5345660	Now that's the big deal.
5345660	5350780	I'd already done cloud gaming on my PC, but this was me playing the adventures on my TV
5350780	5351820	and it wasn't bad at all.
5351820	5353740	Again, it was like watching a YouTube.
5353740	5357820	You see a little bit of, uh, you know, like kind of artifact ingraininess that you would
5357820	5360460	see on a YouTube, but it wasn't terrible by any means.
5360460	5363980	Um, certainly better than spending the a hundred gigs to download it, to take it for a test
5363980	5364620	drive.
5364620	5367340	So maybe cloud gaming really is the future.
5367340	5371980	You know, I feel like I'm, you know, integrating it more and more and getting, you know, it's
5371980	5374380	great for taking things for a test spin and so forth.
5374380	5377980	Certainly what dark soccer is doing is, is a great test case for it as well.
5377980	5381740	There's, I think we're going to see the cloud thing more and more honestly, in the, um,
5381740	5385100	you know, coming years, another quick little update with Stadia.
5386220	5389420	Uh, you can actually jump into friends games now.
5389420	5393340	Um, so, uh, for example, far cry six is one of them.
5393340	5399020	Uh, you can actually go right into, um, somebody else's current game, but somebody does have
5399020	5400940	to enable their privacy settings for that.
5400940	5402540	Of course you can imagine why.
5402540	5406220	So if you go into your privacy tab of Stadia and in the current game, there's an option
5406220	5407580	that says, join your current game.
5407580	5411900	And if you enable that, then somebody can join your game unannounced, which some people
5411900	5412300	would love.
5412300	5413340	Some people would hate.
5413340	5414460	So you can pick that.
5414460	5418540	You can also, of course, set it to friends, um, and all players.
5418540	5419580	I don't know why you'd do that.
5419580	5422060	I guess if you really want to do something multiplayer, you could.
5422060	5423580	Um, so that's kind of neat.
5423580	5428700	Um, it's also what you would expect on some of the other services like Xbox live and PlayStation.
5428700	5432700	So it is nice that Stadia has got that now in the cloud, um, section as well.
5432700	5434460	So good for them.
5435500	5439980	All right, now we're going to get into, forget this cloud gaming stuff.
5439980	5443500	We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no cloud.
5443500	5446220	It was all on a disc in our next segment.
5452060	5463580	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5463580	5465900	out a classic and tell you about it.
5465900	5468540	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5469500	5475580	And once a month, dark soccer instead picks a fucking weird arcade game, but I think everyone
5475580	5476540	knows this one.
5476540	5477660	At least I hope they do.
5477660	5479260	And this is an amazing pick.
5479260	5479820	Dark soccer.
5479820	5480940	What is the flag tonight?
5481580	5487420	Okay, so it is a game that a lot of people know, but it was really freaking weird when
5487420	5487980	it came out.
5489340	5492940	So it's part of it.
5492940	5494220	Don't get me wrong.
5494220	5499740	So it's the typing of the dead, which was funny when I was pulling up the video for
5499740	5499900	it.
5499900	5504220	I hear from the other room, are you playing the house of the dead?
5504860	5510060	No, but it was funny because Dan does like recognize the music from like the first two
5510060	5510560	bars.
5511820	5516220	Typing of the Dead was an arcade game that was developed by Wow Entertainment, published
5516220	5518220	by Sega for the NAOMI hardware.
5518780	5525660	It came out in 1999 in Japan and then had a port to Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit.
5526460	5532300	There was another version for Windows that came out in 2000 in the PS2 port in 2004.
5533020	5539660	So this is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun game.
5539660	5544940	The House of the Dead 2, where instead of a gun, you have a keyboard.
5546380	5553980	And so you type to kill your enemies and, you know, typing faster is better.
5553980	5557340	You know, you've got to type before the enemy is going to attack you.
5558060	5561660	And it's really, really cool.
5561660	5567740	It was actually considered a form of edutainment when it came out, and a lot of critics actually
5567740	5569580	said, hey, this is great.
5569580	5570860	It's funny.
5570860	5572140	It can be difficult.
5572140	5573020	It's original.
5573980	5579900	The PC version of Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003.
5581820	5587020	The PS2 port was called Typing of the Dead Zombicanic, and it was released in Japan December
5587020	5589580	2004, and it came with USB keyboard.
5590860	5593500	There was Typing of the Dead 2 that came out in Japan.
5593500	5598540	English of the Dead, which was a revision for House of the Dead 2, was also released
5599260	5602540	to learn as a language learning game in Japan for the Nintendo DS.
5603100	5607340	And then there's an iOS remake that was called Flick of the Dead.
5608300	5612300	And then it was, of course, Typing of the Dead Overkill, which was based on House of
5612300	5616380	the Dead Overkill, came out for Windows in October 2015.
5616380	5618380	And we have the distinction of having a text pack.
5620780	5624460	These are special, and awesome, and educational.
5625900	5629500	Anyway, so it is just House of the Dead 2.
5629500	5630940	It's, you know, rail shooter.
5630940	5632140	You just type text shit.
5634860	5637900	You can actually play the Japanese version fairly easily.
5639900	5645340	I don't think it has too many non-English characters in it.
5646620	5651500	But the thing I need to point out, and this is why I'm bringing this one up, is that it
5651500	5656380	is not the only keyboard game that's been out.
5656380	5658220	I mean, we have...
5659740	5664220	There was the one that was the loop on the third, the typing.
5665100	5666140	Oh, yeah.
5667580	5669580	I think I've never seen that once.
5669580	5671500	Yeah, which is actually what I almost picked.
5671500	5674140	And it's another Sega game.
5674140	5679660	It was developed by WoW, as well, published on the NAOMI system.
5679660	5684220	So it was based off of Loop in the Third, the shooting that came out the year before
5684220	5684720	that.
5685100	5690700	So there are just a variety of, you know...
5691260	5692940	I think there's another one.
5694860	5695820	There was...
5701420	5703500	Can I say really quick while you're while you're brainstorming?
5703500	5705260	Neon Ships was, I think, one.
5706620	5710140	Bobby Black Wolf in chat reminds, and I was going to bring this up, I promise.
5710140	5714860	I was going to Dark Soccer get to the segment, but a reminder that for the Steam version
5714860	5717740	of the game, because again, this game is incredible.
5717740	5718540	Check it out.
5718540	5721660	But there's the OLR mod.
5721660	5724460	It's an official Steam mod that I put out.
5725180	5725900	I want to say Episode 6.
5725900	5727020	You did mention that.
5727020	5727740	Oh, I'm sorry.
5727740	5728540	Which I talked about.
5728540	5729100	I'm sorry.
5729100	5731420	I went AFK to the potty and I caught up on chat.
5731420	5731920	Sorry.
5732620	5733120	It's okay.
5734380	5738540	Well, I didn't say specifically Steam, but I did say it was the Windows version.
5738540	5739040	Gotcha.
5741500	5743020	But there we go.
5744380	5750540	And of course, it's got three different endings based on how you answer the questions that
5750540	5751740	the Emperor asks.
5753340	5756460	You have the explosion ending where you defeat the Emperor.
5756460	5761580	You see Goldman falling off of a building, and then there's an explosion when he hits
5761580	5765740	the ground and you have to type honest answers to questions during the boss fight.
5765740	5767260	So that's how you get that one.
5767260	5775180	There's the bungee ending where if you do untruthful or strange answers during the boss
5775180	5782220	fight, then you get a bungee cord attached to Goldman's leg, and he returns to where
5782220	5783740	he came from and burps.
5784780	5790460	And then you have the Superman ending where you have to do untruthful answers only to
5790460	5791980	the questions asked in the boss fight.
5792620	5800460	And instead of him jumping, Goldman jumping off or falling off, he waves to the narrator
5800460	5803340	and raises his hands and rises into the sky.
5806620	5807260	And that's it.
5807900	5809660	So it got great reviews.
5809660	5812140	Like I said, Famitsu gave it 35 out of 40.
5812860	5819180	Everyone thought it was just so absurd that it's just, it was hilarious.
5820060	5822540	Game Informer named it the weirdest game of all time.
5824540	5829020	The graphics have, of course, been criticized because, I mean, it wasn't updated from House
5829020	5837900	of the Dead 2, and there's actually even PC World said it was a runner up on the top 10
5837900	5838940	worst games list.
5838940	5840300	What the fuck do they know?
5840300	5841580	They don't have sense of the femur.
5841580	5850220	But yeah, they're probably holding up the new steam release to or I say no, but it's
5850220	5850780	a few years old.
5850780	5853500	They're holding that up to, like, new guidelines.
5853500	5855660	And I think they're probably looking at it through the wrong.
5855660	5860940	This is 2014 still when it was ranked as one of the worst.
5862140	5862300	Yeah.
5862300	5864700	So that wasn't that the year that it came out on steam?
5866460	5869900	I don't know.
5870860	5879420	But even so, I mean, they said they didn't think the concept was that novel.
5880140	5880620	Whatever.
5881180	5882300	Then go play something else.
5883340	5889580	I mean, honestly, the House of the Dead, any of the typing of the dead ones, like, they
5890300	5890800	don't.
5891660	5892940	They're really fun.
5892940	5899260	They like, I remember going to Jessica's house and us both having our keyboards.
5900060	5907340	Two player house typing of the dead and having the best time.
5907340	5910380	Of course, sometimes there was drinking involved and then we would play drunk and that was
5910380	5910880	terrible.
5912220	5918140	But yeah, it's probably up there with one of my favorite games.
5918140	5921580	But it is definitely a fucking weird arcade game when it came out.
5921580	5922620	Absolutely.
5922620	5923660	Great pick.
5923660	5924220	There it is.
5924220	5925260	Your flag.
5925260	5926060	Oh, the month.
5926780	5931980	The typing of the dead, or is our DJ on the chat says this game looks better than the
5931980	5932480	movie.
5933900	5935180	Everything looks better.
5935180	5936700	Everything looks better than that movie.
5936700	5937980	So there you go.
5937980	5938860	All right.
5938860	5939420	Great pick.
5939980	5941260	Great trip down memory lane.
5941260	5944060	Great chance to plug the OLR mod that's out there.
5944060	5946780	That honestly should go back and update.
5946780	5948940	I just I will caution.
5949740	5956700	A lot of the stuff that's in there is old, like it's old references to the show when
5956700	5960700	it was a little more wild and we had more people here every week for the show.
5960700	5964140	Like, you know, there used to have, you know, we crammed like six people in the studio every
5964140	5965340	week and we had all that.
5965340	5970140	So there's a lot of like old jokes that might not resonate with if you found the show in
5970140	5971100	the past five years.
5972060	5974540	But I still think it's I think it's neat that we did a mod.
5974540	5976540	We should do an updated pack for reasons.
5976540	5980380	I was going to say we should do an updated one, but I also I'm like, well, what updated
5980380	5981260	jokes do we have?
5982380	5987100	I need the help of some OLR historians to add stuff in there.
5987100	5988540	I'm happy to do an update, though.
5988540	5989740	I think it would be fun.
5989740	5995260	So and I think Questbuster really sums it up for me in chat over twitch.tv slash vog
5995260	5998860	network saying this is one of the reasons I love Sega.
5998860	6002940	They're willing to take risks like this from time to time, even now.
6003580	6004940	So and agree.
6005020	6009260	That's I think what a lot I mean, just think of all that crazy shit from the late 90s Sega
6009260	6009980	Dreamcast era.
6009980	6011020	Samba de Amigo.
6011020	6015820	Hello, weird Space Channel five wild crazy taxi.
6015820	6016700	Crazy.
6016700	6020140	You know, it's just that's now that stuff.
6020140	6023580	I don't know if it's just because we're in a certain generation of gamers or what, but
6023580	6029740	all that stuff is like the peak of gaming in many ways for many of us, I think so.
6030380	6032780	She Hulk 10 in chat says, what's flag?
6032780	6035900	Flag stands for fucking weird arcade game.
6035900	6038860	And it's because every month of the week.
6040060	6043340	Of the of the month, because every of the week of the month.
6043340	6045580	But I just do them all the time, but I'll run out.
6045580	6046460	They're all weird.
6046460	6052700	We've been doing a yearly twist since twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen, where Dark Sakura
6052700	6054940	mixes it up and once a month she does something different.
6054940	6057900	So one year she did classic consoles.
6057900	6060300	I think soundtracks was one year.
6060300	6061900	There was one other one, I think.
6061900	6064380	Oh, peripherals was last year, if I remember right.
6064380	6066380	So I did pinballs.
6067020	6067260	Yeah.
6067260	6069340	This this I don't think you did pinballs yet.
6069340	6071180	Maybe that's not pinball.
6071180	6071740	Did you?
6071740	6072140	Did you?
6073020	6073500	Yeah.
6073500	6079180	OK, time flies because I had to I gave myself a limit that they were anything that was at
6079180	6081820	the beginning of using the DMD system for scoring.
6081820	6082060	Wow.
6082060	6082700	Yeah, you're right.
6082700	6083100	You're right.
6083100	6086940	OK, so then this now we're at the this is me.
6086940	6090060	I know, but it's just like it all blurs together.
6090060	6092140	And also, to be fair, you talk about pinball a lot.
6092140	6096860	OK, it doesn't need its own statement, but I love him.
6096860	6097260	It's fine.
6097820	6102940	Who doesn't love the ball so that this year the twist was the fucking weird arcade game
6102940	6105820	where Dark Sakura would pick a game that was really crazy in arcades.
6105820	6109900	And, you know, again, I would urge you all to go to the wiki, which is orange lounge
6109900	6111980	radio dot fandom dot com.
6111980	6116300	Now, I think it used to be Wikia, but they want some company bought the other.
6116300	6120060	So and yeah, as Joe and Matt says, there's only one more flag left.
6120060	6120620	That's right.
6120620	6122140	December is the only month left.
6122140	6127100	So Dark Sakura will go out with a bang and then got to think of next year's one.
6127100	6130780	I know some ideas have come up, but we'll let Dark Sakura pick what she wants to do
6131500	6135100	as we move into 2022 and the 20th year of the show.
6136780	6141020	The 20th year in my worst arcade game, what's that?
6141020	6143980	I'll do worst game of the month, worst game of the month.
6143980	6147500	You've picked some stinkers, but I mean, you can do more stinkers.
6147500	6148540	I'll think of something.
6148540	6151100	There's a lot of shitty games out there.
6151100	6151600	All right.
6152700	6154300	Thank you, Orange Right, who sends a link.
6154300	6157740	And so you can see all the previous classic games and the different themes and all that
6157740	6158220	stuff.
6158220	6159020	So there you go.
6159820	6160220	All right.
6161180	6161580	Halo.
6161580	6162380	OK, Bobby.
6163580	6167900	Bobby says finally, Halo gets in legit with the worst game of the month.
6167900	6175020	I'm going to say, remember, I did Halo for a lot of money for my mother and it was legit
6175740	6176620	and it was legit.
6179020	6181660	If I do another Halo game.
6186140	6191980	I don't even know, maybe, maybe, maybe something will happen, maybe one of the prizes for like
6191980	6194940	a subathon or something will be I do Halo two.
6195900	6197740	It's got to be a subathon here, though.
6198380	6199100	Vogue Network.
6199100	6201020	I didn't say I wouldn't do it for myself.
6201020	6202060	I do it here.
6202060	6203500	OK, all right.
6204140	6205340	Who do you think I am?
6207180	6208060	Of course, I would do it on my own.
6208060	6208620	Capitalist.
6208620	6210860	I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
6210860	6212460	All right, moving on.
6213260	6216460	Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some things going on in the industry
6216460	6217420	rather quickly.
6217420	6220140	And we will go to, I think, Loki first.
6220940	6228620	Yeah, so, you know, I've been a big fan of Lego stuff and we were buying most of the
6228620	6229740	Mario sets.
6229740	6233740	We've kind of stopped because we got too many of them and my son doesn't want to build the
6233740	6234700	ones I buy for him.
6234700	6235660	So there's a lot of them.
6236460	6237180	There is a lot.
6237180	6241580	So as you may remember, Lego Luigi is a thing now.
6242300	6244860	He was introduced back in August, I believe.
6245500	6252220	And now they've got some more Luigi centric sets, including the brand new Luigi's Mansion
6252220	6253660	sets that are coming out.
6253660	6259900	So there's actually one there's a brand new like entryway expansion set that they've got
6259900	6261260	for like 40 bucks.
6261260	6263900	It looks kind of cool with some of the ghosts from the game.
6263900	6271660	There is a the lab and Poltergust expansion set, which gives you the actual Poltergust
6272380	6274220	suit that Luigi can wear.
6275020	6281660	And as also Professor Egad in there, and then they have a more elaborate set, which is the
6281660	6285660	haunt and seek expansion set, which is 80 bucks.
6285660	6290540	And it's got like a bunch of stuff from like a haunted house in there, including King Boo.
6291420	6293500	But pretty elaborate stuff.
6295660	6298940	Probably won't be buying that, though, but neat.
6298940	6300620	I like to see more Mario sets.
6301740	6305180	And then obviously, that partnership is doing very well for both those companies.
6305180	6306300	Yes, yes, yes.
6307660	6312380	And then also, of course, we've got an update to Super Mario 3D All Stars.
6312380	6316620	You may remember that was a game that was released back in September of last year.
6316620	6319500	And then they just continued in March when they.
6320940	6325820	Decided to roll out their expansion pass for their Nintendo online.
6325820	6326700	No, no, no, no, no.
6326700	6328140	It's a limited celebration.
6328140	6329020	It's a celebration.
6329580	6333980	Eventually, the celebration has to read that was driving that.
6333980	6336380	Eventually, the lights have to go out.
6336380	6338620	Eventually, the hors d'oeuvres spoil.
6339660	6341260	So here's OK.
6341260	6348380	So to that to to that, this is going to be the most unnecessary expansion ever, but or
6348380	6349100	update ever.
6349660	6355100	So Super Mario 3D All Stars is adding Nintendo 64 controller support.
6355740	6361100	But you may remember that the Nintendo 64 controller, aside from being impossible to
6361100	6364540	get right now because it's Nintendo and they don't know how to manage the supply chain,
6365740	6371820	you could only purchase that if you had the expansion pass through Nintendo online,
6371820	6375580	which you would have already gotten Mario Super Mario 64.
6375580	6380300	But hey, if you want to play it again on a copy, you already bought now.
6381580	6383100	They're letting you do that.
6383100	6384300	How generous of them.
6387500	6388060	I don't know.
6388060	6389020	It's stupid.
6389020	6389980	It's so stupid.
6389980	6395980	It's weird to see that get a patch, but I mean, it makes it's nice that they're supporting
6395980	6400380	it, but like it's the hoops you got to jump through to be able to do that is just stupid.
6400380	6402060	It's nice, but I don't care.
6402060	6405260	Like that's that sums me up, I guess.
6405900	6408220	All right, Dar Sakura, you've got one for us.
6409020	6409520	I do.
6410400	6419280	It looks like that filming for The Last of Us is actually done.
6421040	6423520	Neil Druckmann posted, and I'll read this verbatim.
6423520	6427360	Alas, my time in Canada has come to an end to the best TV crew in the world.
6427360	6430880	Thank you for your incredible work, your passion, and for making me feel so welcome.
6430880	6432080	I will miss you terribly.
6432080	6434800	Excited to return to Naughty Dog and some warmer weather.
6434800	6447120	And yeah, he put a picture of a clapboard with The Last of Us on it, and it's the same
6447120	6450240	font, but red with like a design on it.
6450240	6455920	And yeah, it might be done filming completely, so we'll see.
6456720	6458960	Now to edit it and get all the special effects done.
6458960	6462480	So it's still probably going to be a little while, but I think that the bar is pretty
6462480	6465600	high for that, but it looks like they've got a good cast.
6465600	6468640	So be very curious to see how that turns out for sure.
6468640	6469140	Totally.
6470000	6472000	Speaking of media, I've got a story for you guys.
6472000	6476160	And this trailer, I know, showed up in our Discord over at vognetwork.com
6476160	6480000	slash Discord because, you know, who doesn't love Neil Patrick Harris?
6480640	6482560	And that's why everybody's sharing this movie, right?
6482560	6483600	Well, I'm sure that's part of it.
6483600	6487280	But the other part is it plays in the Nintendo hardcore.
6487280	6490640	So it's a movie coming to HBO Max called 8-Bit Christmas.
6491280	6492720	And it's talking about it.
6492720	6494160	Look, I'm gonna be honest.
6494160	6495520	I watched the trailer.
6496480	6500800	And to me, it's just completely trying to rip off a Christmas story and get that same
6500800	6501680	sort of vibe.
6501680	6503840	But instead of a BB gun, it's a Nintendo.
6504800	6508640	What this has to do with video games, I'm not exactly sure, but I guess we can expect
6508640	6511040	to see Nintendo stuff featured in the movie.
6511680	6514960	And of course, it's just tugging at our heartstrings because a lot of us look at that and go,
6514960	6519360	oh, oh, that was me going to my friend's house trying to play the Nintendo and all that stuff.
6519920	6526320	It would have been a perfect time for them to do some sort of partnership deal to re-release
6526320	6529040	the NES Classic Edition, wouldn't you think?
6530080	6532080	That's how a smart business person thinks.
6532080	6533440	That's how a smart business person thinks.
6533440	6535600	But this is Nintendo and they won't do that.
6536240	6538240	Anyway, the trailer's all over.
6538240	6540080	I'm sure many of you guys have seen it by now.
6540080	6541360	It's on HBO Max.
6541360	6542560	It has Neil Patrick Harris.
6543200	6545440	I will wait to see what my friends think of it.
6545440	6550560	I'm not exactly in a rush to watch it, but it's not because completely that I'm a bitch.
6550560	6556640	It's just that I don't, you know, I watch a lot more Twitch and I play a lot more video
6556640	6560800	games and I really have to be intentional if I'm going to break to watch a movie or
6560800	6561680	something like that.
6561680	6564800	Tigerclaw does point out that it's based on a book.
6564800	6568880	Mike Deff says it's nostalgia bait, but I'll watch because of Neil Patrick Harris.
6568880	6572320	And that's where I'm kind of like not going to write it off completely.
6572320	6573520	I do love that man.
6573520	6574880	So yeah.
6574880	6578080	And by the way, did y'all see his Halloween?
6578080	6581840	Like every year that family goes all out for Halloween and it's amazing.
6581840	6583120	It's also those kids are growing up.
6583120	6584560	Those kids are like 10 or 11 now.
6584560	6587120	So they do amazing stuff in the new Matrix movie.
6587120	6588160	That's right.
6588160	6590560	Yeah, that Matrix movie has a hell of a cast.
6590560	6594080	That is a movie I will set aside the time to watch.
6594080	6594560	Guaranteed.
6595840	6597920	I will borrow a friend's HBO Max.
6597920	6600240	Actually, I might go to the fucking theater to see it quite honestly.
6600240	6601760	I'll see it in the theater.
6602640	6605600	Anyway, Tigerclaw says it's based on the book.
6605600	6607440	Yes, there is a book on it.
6607440	6609040	And so it comes from that.
6609040	6613920	So was A Christmas Story, which is the original nostalgia porn.
6613920	6615840	I think that ties into this.
6615840	6618480	All right, let's move on.
6618480	6620480	Travel around the world and check out some releases.
6620480	6621680	Actually, no, I lied.
6621680	6625040	I'm going to insert a story here in Rapid Fire News because we had a really good one
6625040	6627280	shared by Bobby in chat.
6627280	6628320	And I think this is worth sharing.
6628320	6631680	I should save this for last minute stories, but I'm not going to.
6632160	6633200	Because this is kind of huge.
6634400	6641040	Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 3 going to be removed from PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
6641040	6643360	Nintendo 3DS and so on in those stores.
6643360	6644480	They're saying it's temporary.
6645600	6650160	Apparently, there is historical archive footage that appears in the game.
6650960	6652400	The licenses have expired.
6653120	6660000	Konami is therefore legally obligated to yank the game until they can either fix it and
6660000	6665600	remove that footage, which I doubt they're going to use the resources to do, or they're
6665600	6669680	going to, I guess, try to reinstate the licenses.
6669680	6673760	They are saying in this press release on their official site, konami.com.
6673760	6678080	We sincerely ask for your patience and understanding as we work towards making these products available
6678080	6679360	for purchase once again.
6679360	6681760	So they are going to try to get them back up again.
6682320	6687600	There's a lot of this affects the GOG version of Metal Gear Solid 2.
6688320	6690560	Many PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.
6690560	6693280	I mean, the storefronts are already kind of on their way out as it is.
6693280	6698480	PlayStation Now, that's the when I see that, that's the big one.
6698480	6700240	They have to yank it off the cloud.
6701280	6705520	Something to think about with these licenses and expiring and the cloud gaming we're moving
6705520	6709520	to just that's the one that catches my eye is the PlayStation Now version of the game
6709520	6710720	is going to disappear.
6710720	6711520	Hmm.
6711520	6716960	So anyway, and that involves for PlayStation Now and PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.
6716960	6719040	That's the HD collection.
6719040	6723440	They have to throw out the whole collection for now because, of course, it includes number
6723440	6724320	two and number three.
6725040	6725840	So interesting.
6726480	6729120	Garth the Wolf in chat says, Konami looking sus.
6729920	6731840	Well, it is legal obligations.
6731840	6735600	It's just what good news is coming out of Konami lately?
6735600	6736080	I'll wait.
6737840	6740080	Oh, the new BeatMania 2DX.
6740080	6741200	I really want to play that.
6741200	6743840	That's, I guess, there's your good news for Konami.
6744480	6745280	The rest?
6745280	6748640	Well, we have a story on E-Football coming up later, and I will just let that speak for
6748640	6749140	itself.
6750560	6751060	Anyhow.
6751680	6752480	All right.
6752480	6753040	Oh, yeah.
6753040	6757600	Darticuya says, remember Dynamite Rave literally had to be rewritten about 2009 or so.
6757600	6759760	Yeah, they are not good with licensing sometimes.
6759760	6760260	Yes.
6760880	6762880	How about the Silent Hill remaster?
6763680	6764320	Enough said.
6765600	6766800	I don't like the remake.
6768000	6768480	Oh, yeah.
6768480	6768720	Okay.
6768720	6769520	Sacred Jade.
6769520	6770240	I will.
6770240	6770560	Okay.
6770560	6771040	Yes.
6771040	6771280	Yes.
6771280	6771600	I will.
6771600	6773360	I will golf clap that response.
6773360	6774960	Castlevania collection.
6774960	6777280	That is some good news that came out of Konami.
6777280	6781680	I do want to point out they did contract with that other company to make the game for them.
6782640	6784800	However, point taken.
6784800	6786000	Point acknowledged.
6786000	6787200	Golf clap earned.
6787200	6787600	Thank you.
6788240	6788720	All right.
6789280	6789520	All right.
6789520	6792400	Orange Rite is now putting out the TurboGrafx-16 mini.
6792400	6794640	I will give you one clap because that was last year.
6794640	6794960	All right.
6795600	6796000	Enough.
6796560	6797120	Moving on.
6798400	6800080	You all know the point I'm trying to make.
6800080	6801360	It's a hot mess over there.
6801360	6802000	All right.
6802000	6804800	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are
6805680	6808720	from Konami or otherwise in the coming week.
6808720	6810560	And we'll go to the US and Loki.
6811680	6811920	Yes.
6812480	6818720	So we have Blue Reflection, Second Light on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6819680	6826640	Football Manager 2022 on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, iOS, and
6826640	6827200	Android.
6828240	6833280	Forza Horizon 5 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6834160	6841200	We have Jurassic World Evolution 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and
6841200	6842320	Xbox Series.
6843440	6846720	The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Anniversary Edition.
6846720	6847280	That's right.
6847280	6852240	Todd Howard is doing it again, and he's going to make you buy Skyrim again, even though
6852240	6855280	they already did a remastered anniversary edition before.
6855280	6863360	That's coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6864400	6868080	The Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy, the definitive edition.
6868080	6871680	Sure enough, it is definitive until they release another one.
6872480	6877680	That's also coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and
6877680	6878480	Xbox Series.
6879040	6881120	If they do another one, would it be redefinitive?
6881120	6885920	It's a serious question.
6885920	6888800	In the Grand Theft Auto, Rockstar Games doesn't want to make a new game.
6890080	6896640	PUBG The New State on iOS and Android, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Nintendo
6896640	6903040	Switch, and finally, we've got Shin Megami Tensei 5 on Nintendo Switch.
6903040	6903440	That's it.
6904480	6907760	All right, going to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
6907760	6912320	You bet Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a huge release this week on the Nintendo Switch.
6912320	6914560	It has a regular edition, a limited edition.
6915200	6918720	There's even some peripherals that are coming out that are Shin Megami Tensei branded, of
6918720	6920400	course, because that game is huge.
6920400	6923040	So you can check all that out on the 11th when the game launches there.
6923040	6925840	There are some other titles on the Nintendo Switch as well.
6926400	6928720	What Would Dare go up against Shin Megami Tensei?
6928720	6931120	How about Laid Back Camp, Have a Nice Day?
6931120	6932160	That is out this week.
6933040	6935840	Dragon Quest X, Heroes of the Heavenly Stars online.
6935840	6936320	I'm not sure.
6936320	6937520	That must be some type of re-release.
6937520	6940160	I don't know if that's the first time on the Switch or what it is, but that is out
6940160	6941360	as well in Japan this week.
6942080	6945120	And Megaton Musashi is out this week as well in Japan.
6945120	6950160	And Labyrinth of Galleria, Coven of Dusk is all out this week on the Nintendo Switch.
6950720	6954080	Looking at the PlayStation 4, I imagine you have some of the similar stuff.
6954080	6958240	Yep, we have Megaton Musashi is also out this week in the Dragon Quest game.
6958240	6960880	Also on PlayStation 4.
6960880	6965840	Let me check PS5 and see if any of those games made it over there this week.
6966560	6973760	No, the next release is a Battlefield 2042, Japan's release, excuse me, on the 19th.
6973760	6975680	So we're still a little ways from that.
6976480	6978160	Let's go to the UK and Dark Sakura.
6981440	6982320	I think you have a mute.
6982960	6984480	Yes, you have a Discord mute.
6986960	6992560	On the 9th, we have Forza Horizon 5 on Xbox.
6993200	6997360	For Xbox and PlayStation, Jurassic World Evolution 2 on the same day.
6997360	6998960	The rest of these are on the 12th.
6998960	7001440	We have Human Fall Flat Anniversary Edition.
7002000	7005040	We have Game & Watch The Legend of Zelda.
7005600	7006100	Nice.
7006560	7009280	We have Shin Megami Tensei V5.
7010080	7011520	I did the thing.
7011520	7013760	I hate that I did the thing and I did the thing.
7013760	7015600	Shin Megami Tensei V.
7015600	7017680	And then Let's Sing 2022.
7017680	7021520	I did the thing, Rob.
7021520	7023360	How dare I do the thing?
7023360	7023920	I know.
7023920	7025280	I'm going to clip that.
7025280	7025520	All right.
7025520	7026240	No, just kidding.
7026240	7027440	No, do not.
7028320	7029120	All right.
7029120	7032000	Let's move on and get some more headlines.
7032000	7036160	And then, of course, we'll take your calls and your emails and all that good stuff and
7036160	7039600	really make it your show a little later on with the listener roundtable.
7039600	7042720	But for now, we have some more headlines to talk about, starting with Loki.
7042720	7056560	Yeah, so this is a story Nintendo has promised to continually to improve the switch online
7056560	7063120	since there's been some backlash basically saying in there and was that their investor
7063120	7068640	meeting, I believe that the last month we released in the switch online plus expansion
7068640	7072240	pack a new membership plan that adds content to the existing service.
7073200	7076880	Going forward, we will continue to improve and expand on both Nintendo Switch Online
7076880	7081440	and Nintendo Switch Online Plus expansion pack striving to provide services that satisfy
7081440	7081940	customers.
7083520	7087840	Yeah, I better hope you better be continually improving that service.
7087840	7091840	I mean, that's the point of a service that you're charging fifty dollars for.
7092560	7096160	Sony doesn't Sony or Microsoft doesn't just charge it and go, OK, we're done.
7097360	7099200	We're done putting out content.
7099200	7104080	Well, I also took it about the split that they have and now they have two levels and
7104080	7107600	everybody's thinking, well, this basic level is going to be trash now because they want
7107600	7109200	people to pay more for the premium level.
7109200	7112800	So I kind of read it as Nintendo kind of recommitting to both levels.
7113840	7116720	And to confirm, like I even though.
7118720	7123120	I didn't pay for the expansion pack, meaning I did download I did pay for the DLC, though,
7123120	7126960	for Animal Crossing, but I'm not I'm not paying for the expansion back.
7127920	7133840	So they miss out on the five dollars there, but it's still it's stupid, like it's just
7133840	7137040	a principal thing for me, like I don't know.
7137040	7137600	Thank you.
7137600	7141760	Like, I'm not giving you more money, especially when you haven't proved with the current
7141760	7146800	expansion pass stuff that you're willing to continually update it.
7146800	7149680	I mean, it's just minimal effort being put in by them.
7149680	7150080	Yeah.
7150080	7154640	So sorry, I'm not going to you can promise all you want, but you haven't shown that you're
7154640	7155360	going to do it.
7155360	7155760	Yep.
7155840	7156400	Actions.
7156400	7162720	I mean, I understand they have to playing Yakuza games has taught me that the board
7162720	7166240	meetings are very important and you have to please the board of directors.
7166240	7167440	But I get it.
7167440	7170240	With the shareholder meetings, you have to talk a lot of talk.
7170240	7174720	But for us, the gamers, we got to see the action and we got to see the you know, the
7174720	7176080	stuff that really makes it worth it.
7176800	7177280	So we'll see.
7177280	7182320	I'm curious what big free thing Nintendo is going to try to throw at the game and Game
7182320	7183440	Boy Advance games.
7183440	7184320	That's what they're going to do.
7184320	7185600	That's the easiest.
7185600	7187040	Like, come on.
7187040	7189760	I think there needs to be something more like, yes, sure.
7189760	7191920	I like Game Boy, Game Boy Advance games, but I think there needs to be.
7191920	7192560	Here's the problem.
7192560	7193120	Here's the problem.
7194160	7198560	If Game Boy and Game Boy Advance does not include Pokemon, forget it.
7198560	7199440	And that's the thing.
7199440	7201040	Everybody hears Game Boy, Game Boy Advance.
7201040	7202800	They think, oh, well, I want to play the Pokemon games.
7203440	7206320	You better get you better level set those expectations.
7207600	7212480	Because technically those games are from the Pokemon company, which is like second party.
7212480	7217840	So I don't, you know, and also Nintendo can, you know, as they're doing with the fourth
7217840	7221760	gen, just remake those games and charge a whole separate premium for them and people
7221760	7222400	will pay it.
7223040	7227040	So don't assume Pokemon games are going to be a part of that.
7227040	7228160	So what's left?
7228160	7231840	There's Metro, the original Metroid 2, you know, there's some other, you know, not to
7231840	7235440	say obviously there are some good, but I just think the highlights are not going to be what
7235440	7236640	you all want them to be.
7236640	7237280	That's my thought.
7238080	7239760	So, all right.
7242640	7248240	Moving on and on a similar note with Nintendo, and I think we kind of addressed this on a
7248240	7250400	previous show, but it's kind of continue.
7250400	7254800	I want to say this got brought up again this week because of that same shareholder meeting.
7256480	7261040	Nikkei Asia is talking about that Nintendo is going to make 20% fewer Switch consoles
7261040	7262400	through the end of the fiscal year.
7262400	7265040	And this all ties into the chip shortage that's going on.
7265120	7268880	That means 24 million fewer units than what was planned.
7269760	7273520	And yeah, that's basically the headline.
7273520	7278960	I mean, yes, there's still a lot of games when you consider Metroid Dread, the new old
7278960	7282960	Mario Party that came out and, you know, the other things that are on the horizon for next
7282960	7286720	year or Animal Crossing 2.0, if you will.
7286720	7292640	Next year, Splatoon 3, Bayonetta 3, but the reality is the chip shortage is just playing
7292640	7294880	into how many Switches they can make.
7295440	7299840	And if that doesn't scream the answer to what happened to the 4K Switch.
7301920	7307040	Ah, that's I mean, and we said that then it's probably because of the chip shortage.
7307040	7310320	And Nintendo hardware is already hard enough to come by.
7310320	7311600	Now put this on top of it.
7311600	7312800	It's going to be a nightmare.
7312800	7318400	So on when you consider all that, I am glad Nintendo put off the 4K Switch to be quite
7318400	7324800	honest, like because I do not want to have to I do not want to have to Squid Game to
7324800	7327840	win a 4K Switch.
7327840	7332720	So do that when the chip shortage is looking a little better.
7334480	7340320	Speaking of whatever's in the future for Nintendo in that interesting meeting, they did
7340320	7345920	confirm there's another Nintendo console in the works for release 20XX.
7345920	7346480	Great.
7346480	7349600	So we get a new Nintendo console coming out before 2099.
7351840	7358320	It's interesting that a lot of websites are running that as a headline because no fucking
7358320	7358720	shit.
7358720	7360960	Nintendo is working on a new console.
7360960	7361520	Guess what?
7362320	7363680	I feel like I've said this before.
7363680	7364400	I'm going to say it again.
7364400	7366480	PlayStation is working on PlayStation 6.
7367280	7367600	What?
7368480	7369600	But it's so early.
7370160	7376320	These things take years to come up with years of development, trial and error, cost analysis,
7376560	7377440	parts.
7377440	7381120	Now that we're seeing launch games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
7381120	7384560	So yes, of course, they're working on a successor to the Switch.
7384560	7392080	I think the real question is, has the 4K Switch been scrapped altogether for a future like
7392080	7396000	is the future Nintendo console now a 4K Switch?
7396000	7398400	Because that's I think that's where it ends up.
7399120	7400800	But we'll see.
7402240	7405520	Anyhow, on a completely different note, Dark Sakura.
7407280	7407780	Well.
7409040	7413120	We often call politics a game, right?
7413920	7419040	Some of us do, because it really can just go back and forth and one tries to win versus
7419040	7419540	the other.
7420080	7427680	There's actually a Kickstarter now to make a game and to teach about politics and the
7427680	7429600	nature of how it works.
7429600	7435840	It's called Political Arena, created by Elliot Nelson, who is a journalist who wrote for
7435920	7437600	Huffington Post until 2018.
7438160	7439520	So you legislate.
7439520	7440480	And this is actually the quote.
7441200	7445520	You can legislate, you can campaign, you can navigate the media, you can weather scandals,
7445520	7451840	you can try and pick apart the myriad interests on K Street and other special interests.
7451840	7455920	So you customize your politician and then decide how to invest their time.
7457200	7460640	And then you can see how weak or strong they are in certain skills.
7460640	7462320	And then the game plays out from there.
7463280	7470320	So if you are a fan of, you know, following politicians or kind of want to see a little
7470320	7476720	bit about, you know, what all you'd have to juggle for it, you could sign up for the Kickstarter.
7477360	7478720	It looks kind of interesting.
7479360	7489280	Like one of the screenshots on here is like Senator Olin misspells butter, which how many
7489600	7490480	times have we seen?
7491760	7494320	People drug for their grammar.
7494320	7494800	Oh, sure.
7494800	7495840	What by me?
7496480	7501280	How how many of us are old enough to remember the whole potato shenanigans with Vice President
7501280	7502160	Quayle at the time?
7502160	7505280	That was it's very much a reference to that.
7505280	7508480	Yeah, we had way too many of them with the dumpster that we just got used to it.
7509440	7509940	Yeah.
7511680	7515840	What's interesting about this to me, you know, political games are nothing new.
7515840	7519920	I mean, hello, we had that guy who made cat president like the actual.
7519920	7523040	Yeah, that's a political game of sorts, a little tongue in cheek.
7523040	7526240	But I remember playing a game on like the Commodore 64 in the 80s.
7526240	7527760	It was like a campaign manager game.
7527760	7532080	But it's not that the political game element is new, but it's interesting that the talent
7532080	7537040	behind this and that there is, you know, people that might bring some sort of, you know, I
7537040	7542000	don't know if you want to call it insider, but sort of like just more like weathered,
7542000	7544560	I guess, experiences into a game.
7544560	7545440	I think that's interesting.
7546400	7554720	Well, the producer, Diana Williams, she's former exec at Lucasfilm, said that she wants
7554720	7558160	it to be fun to play, but also to be educational.
7560160	7565920	And she one of her quotes is, and if you and if through while having fun, they're able
7565920	7569200	to say, hey, I didn't know this about X, Y, Z, then we have also done our job.
7570080	7577200	Um, she's kind of, you know, wanting this to show a lot more of an honest view of how
7577200	7578400	politics work.
7579200	7586080	I mean, it's very much just like old courtly drama, you know, where this person moves against
7586080	7589840	this person and this person with power moves this way and you make these alliances and
7589840	7592160	you do this thing, except, of course, very modern.
7593600	7596800	You know, she said she wants it to give more information than Schoolhouse Rock.
7597440	7598960	It's chess on a different board.
7599920	7603040	It is, yeah, it's it's really.
7605040	7610400	The only thing that I can really liken the world of politics to, excuse me, my nose is
7610400	7614000	itching as a dumpster on fire in the ocean.
7614880	7619440	No, it's like when you watch, um,
7619440	7627200	I was trying to think, kind of like watching Game of Thrones, I think, when you're watching
7627200	7632240	how the families sort of move against each other and interact and how you sway opinion
7632240	7633840	to get alliances with one or the other.
7633840	7638480	I mean, in this case, if you're trying to sway someone's opinion, you go to a charity
7638480	7643280	dinner, you donate to so-and-so's cause, even if you don't believe in it, you want so-and-so
7643280	7647040	to be on your side because you want them to think that you think the same way they do.
7647760	7651680	Um, it goes also into the less savory side of politics.
7652800	7661440	Um, by like, you can do attack ads, you can do, uh, uh, you know, social media manipulation.
7662320	7670240	Um, you can, I mean, they've even got people, uh, who worked, uh, in campaigns working on
7670240	7670800	this game.
7671440	7681120	Um, it's, it's absolutely, you know, going to be completely, I think, a candid and honest
7681120	7684080	look at it, but still supposed to be something that you're, you're supposed to have fun with.
7685120	7691600	All I have to say about the wide world of politics is remember my ex, the politician?
7693040	7696560	That is all I'm going to say about that.
7696560	7698640	That was a very eye-opening experience.
7698640	7702960	Thankfully, he, even though apparently he got a lot of votes, uh, he did not end up
7702960	7704400	holding public office.
7704400	7708960	And, uh, last I heard still hasn't, although honestly, I haven't heard a lot in a long
7708960	7712160	time, but, uh, the world's a better place for it.
7712160	7713840	Sorry to be shady, but also not sorry.
7715040	7715760	I'm not sorry.
7716720	7717520	I'm not either.
7718160	7720400	I'm just supposed to be nice on, on the show.
7722640	7724720	And I say this as a weird person.
7725600	7726960	He's such a weird guy.
7728640	7729140	Yeah.
7729440	7734880	Well, that's, you know, I embrace my weird and he was completely strange to me.
7734880	7738160	That's what happens when you, uh, you know what, I'm not going to get into it.
7738160	7738880	I'm not going to get into it.
7738880	7739760	I'm not going to get into it.
7739760	7741840	I'm a better, I am a better person.
7741840	7743280	All right, let's move on.
7744480	7748560	Speaking of Loki, why don't you be a better person with this next story?
7750480	7758320	Uh, I don't know if I could be the better person, but so Konami has decided to delay
7758560	7767440	E-Football 2022 version one to next year, probably because there's a lot of updates
7767440	7770240	and fixes they're going to have to do to even get to version one.
7770240	7772640	And so that's just an inevitability of them.
7773440	7776880	But yes, they have pushed it back to spring of 2022.
7777920	7780000	I just say, don't even bother at this point.
7780000	7786480	It's just, it's trash, but yeah, they're, they're pushing it back.
7786880	7789200	Even though they already like, wasn't, they released it and stuff.
7789200	7801520	So yeah, and I go along with that, um, they are, you may remember because, um, we had
7801520	7808480	brought it up in the story, they were so bold to pre-order the premium player pack, which
7808480	7811920	was paid DLC for that premium game.
7812640	7818160	And yeah, they're refunding that for folks because, um, you know, their game is jank
7818160	7818720	and broken.
7822560	7827280	So I apologize for the awkward silence, but I literally have nothing.
7827280	7828800	Congratulations, Konami.
7828800	7832080	You've managed to successfully pee and poo the bed.
7832080	7835360	Like, I don't, I don't know what to say.
7835360	7839840	What do you say to some company that is such a colossal fucking mess?
7839840	7841200	Like, what do you say?
7841200	7846080	What do you say when you walk in the room and just, it's just, it's not even a room.
7848800	7853200	You've literally done that silent hill thing where you go through the hole and like, it
7853200	7856480	was, it used to be a room, but now it's murder.
7856480	7859840	Like, I don't, what, what do you say?
7862960	7863760	There's nothing.
7865520	7870560	And they have like the last thing that they had that was good was like pro Evo soccer.
7870560	7873280	And then they're like, Hey, wait, hold on, hold on.
7873280	7875600	There's still an opportunity for us to screw this up.
7876800	7877600	And you know what?
7879120	7885360	They had, they took, it took some gusto, but they managed to pull that mess up in 2021.
7885360	7886000	They did it.
7886720	7888560	So congrats, Konami.
7889600	7893120	Uh, dark Tetsuya chat says it's that meme from community.
7893120	7895280	He walks in with a pizza and everything's on fire.
7895280	7896560	At least that guy had pizza.
7898560	7899360	That's a fair point.
7900320	7902720	Is, is, is there a playable game here?
7903280	7903760	Nope.
7903760	7905200	At least that guy had pizza.
7906080	7909440	Uh, as Joe and her mat says, just play that Bob Saget clip from dumb and dumber.
7909440	7910480	There's shit everywhere.
7910480	7915520	How about the Bob Saget directed movie dirty work, starring the late Norm McDonald rest
7915520	7921360	in peace where the CA everybody, you have to know the scene where the guys look, there's
7921360	7923280	a dead hooker in that trunk over there.
7923280	7924320	Oh, Oh my gosh.
7924320	7925600	Another dead hooker.
7925600	7930320	Like it's, it's like really a tasteless scene and everything, but it's really funny.
7930320	7936480	Uh, if you have a dirty mind and it's that, that, that is a little more appropriate to
7936480	7938800	what Konami is going through right now.
7938800	7941520	Like, I just, I, I don't know what to say.
7943520	7947840	Um, Mike Defton chat says PT was foreshadowing of Konami state.
7947840	7949840	Now I know why Konami shut it down.
7949840	7952720	Now Bobby Black Wolf points out their gambling side isn't a mess.
7952720	7953600	It makes money.
7953600	7954720	Well, you know, what's interesting.
7954720	7960480	And maybe this goes back to the old division of, um, Konami, the arcade publisher and case
7960480	7960720	set.
7960720	7964880	What used to be that Konami, you know, computer entertainment, I guess technically still is
7964880	7966320	except they closed all the U S offices.
7966320	7967920	I don't even know how to sort that mess anymore.
7967920	7975040	My point is arcade hardware, gambling machines, things like that.
7975040	7975600	Pachinko.
7976320	7977280	Those are all fine.
7978560	7979920	It's the software division.
7979920	7981040	That's a fucking nightmare.
7981520	7985760	Now, yes, uh, y'all brought up the Castlevania thing, but again, I said that really, that
7985760	7987200	kind of wasn't Konami.
7987200	7989600	That kind of wasn't, it actually wasn't Konami.
7989600	7990880	It was their, it was their games.
7990880	7994240	It was their, it was their old shit, but somebody did it for them.
7994240	7999280	And honestly, after hearing about this football game, I think we should all be thankful someone
7999280	8004400	else did it for them because believe me, Konami would have found a way to pee and poo that
8004400	8008240	Castlevania collection if they'd done it themselves.
8008880	8015440	Uh, Tigerclaw in chat says, I still can't get over the fact two of the channels here
8015440	8018320	are named after the company that used to make arcade games.
8018320	8023440	Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, I think talking about, they were talking about something else, uh, with
8023440	8024640	Valley Sports and all that stuff.
8024640	8031040	Um, I, it is funny that the name of our show comes from a Konami namesake, but it is, it
8031040	8034160	is quite literally the Konami of a different era, literally.
8034720	8037840	And we'll always keep DDR near and dear in our hearts.
8037840	8040080	And like I said, honestly, arcade division's fine.
8040080	8041360	Like new DDR mixes.
8041360	8042080	Cool.
8042080	8043360	Uh, new 2DXs.
8043360	8043680	Yeah.
8043680	8044400	You know, all that stuff.
8044400	8044800	That's fine.
8044800	8048240	I don't got, I don't got no complaints about that, except I just got old.
8048240	8053360	I'm a Bamani boomer now as we talked about on a previous episode of OLR, but, um, that's
8053360	8054000	all cool.
8054000	8055040	I don't got a problem with that.
8056960	8062480	Anyway, one more story for you guys and Loki kind of referenced this already.
8062480	8063040	Thanks, Loki.
8063040	8067760	You know, but I understand it's in the release dates, but, um, Hey, look, Skyrim.
8067840	8075120	Is coming out once again, it is the anniversary edition and it's kind of all over the place.
8075120	8075620	Okay.
8076000	8076960	So here's the deal.
8078080	8078720	God damn it.
8078720	8082080	The story won't open because it thinks I'm using an ad blocker on this site.
8082080	8087600	Um, there are different price levels for this, uh, uh, game that's coming out.
8087600	8089760	There's going to be $49.99 edition.
8089760	8093600	And I think that's the new one, or it's going to be $19.99.
8093600	8097200	If you want to just upgrade, I guess your existing edition.
8097200	8101680	But then I also heard one of them is coming out on game pass somehow.
8102400	8107040	Because Skyrim is there, but it's like not the newest one, even though Microsoft owns
8107040	8111120	Bethesda now, like this newest one is not coming out right away or something.
8111120	8111600	I don't know.
8111600	8114880	It seems like a disaster, uh, of different pricing.
8114880	8115360	It's confused.
8115360	8118800	I shouldn't say disaster because, you know, Skyrim is a good game, but it's confusing
8118800	8119680	all these different tiers.
8119680	8126080	And it's confusing why Skyrim is getting released again, but it's, you know, the 10 year collection
8126080	8132080	and I get it from the perspective of, okay, they have to make it even better for the Xbox
8132080	8137520	series and for PlayStation five, but it's like, okay, they already kind of redid it
8137520	8141680	for Xbox one X and you can play that version on game and it looks fine.
8141680	8142320	It looks great.
8142320	8143760	It looks better than fine.
8143760	8149120	Um, so I guess what now you get ray tracing and extra sparkles and things like that.
8149120	8149840	Cool.
8149840	8155600	Um, but I don't, I don't know if it's really necessary to drop money to get this game all
8155680	8156320	over again.
8156800	8160160	Um, but I guess Bethesda is hoping many of you will think differently.
8161600	8162880	Anything you want to add to that Loki?
8162880	8164320	Cause I know you're a Skyrim fan.
8165360	8171520	Um, it's, it's a lot of it is just these, they keep trying to push that, uh, the creator
8171520	8172720	club stuff really.
8172720	8176000	And so there's like a lot of pieces from that, but it's, it's all mods.
8176560	8177680	Some of it's kind of cool.
8177680	8182800	I mean, they've got like fishing and stuff in there now and, um, different armor sets.
8182800	8186320	Like if you're a fan of the other elder scrolls games, there's armor sets from those.
8186880	8188960	Um, is it 1999?
8188960	8189200	Cool.
8189200	8190480	Because that's the cost to upgrade.
8192240	8192960	Probably.
8192960	8194640	I mean, there's a lot of content in there.
8194640	8195280	I just don't know.
8195280	8197680	I'll just wait for the go on sale there.
8197680	8200400	At the very least, they're giving you some stuff for free though.
8200400	8203760	So even if you don't upgrade and you already have a special edition, which probably most
8203760	8206320	of you did, cause they also updated that for free.
8206400	8214000	Um, then you get like, there's three big pieces of DLC kind of there being thrown in there.
8214000	8217440	So I'll wait, it'll hit game pass eventually.
8217440	8218800	It will hit game as eventually.
8218800	8220400	It has to, I'll wait for that.
8220400	8221280	I mean, yeah.
8221280	8224960	I mean, it's definitely gonna hit game pass eventually and, and see sales.
8224960	8227680	I mean, that's just always they're cheap, so just wait.
8228720	8229120	All right.
8229840	8231200	But don't wait for this segment.
8231200	8234400	It's the listener round table where we're going to take your calls.
8234400	8239600	If you'd like to call us over at vognetwork.com slash discord, just hop into the green room
8239600	8244960	and we might take a call or two, but we also want to take a look inside our mailbag, which
8244960	8247440	is at participate at orangelandtrader.com.
8248320	8251920	Something that was brought to my attention though, um, by a listener in our discord today
8251920	8254800	over at vognetwork.com slash discord, because, you know, we chat with you all throughout
8254800	8259360	the week, um, is that somebody tried to send an email through the website and it didn't
8259360	8260080	work.
8260080	8264080	Um, I have to confess the website is old and it's broken.
8264080	8269360	And the only reason it exists right now is because it powers this show, uh, and the feed,
8269360	8271520	uh, that is still on iTunes.
8271520	8277760	And I am scared as hell to change some of that because, um, obviously I don't want,
8277760	8282240	I don't want to lose the podcast feed that we have and you, cause we have like, we're
8282240	8286560	probably the, I don't, is there an older show on iTunes?
8286560	8290240	I don't, we've been, we've been on iTunes since day one.
8290880	8294160	I don't know if there's any other current running show that was there on day one.
8294160	8297840	Like, I'm not trying to toot our horn too much toot toot, but like there's certain,
8297840	8303360	yeah, Guinness, there's certain types of prestige you don't want to lose.
8303360	8304160	And that's one of them.
8305040	8311680	So, um, my point is the website has been updated in like 15 years and Hey, update the website,
8311680	8313120	just don't touch the feed links.
8313120	8315040	And that, that might be the ultimate solution.
8315040	8317120	And you know, Jason and I talked about it a long time ago.
8317120	8318320	We just never got around to it.
8318320	8319840	And I do want to be clear.
8319840	8324080	Somebody was very kind, a listener named Deke Mann and I'm sure if he still listens to the
8324080	8328240	show, somebody was very kind in doing that website for us 15 years ago and did it out
8328240	8329280	of the goodness of his heart.
8329280	8330480	And I just want to say thank you.
8330480	8331840	I can never thank you enough for that.
8331840	8336400	I can't thank Jason enough for the multiple favors around on Facebook.
8336400	8337520	I see him on Facebook.
8337520	8337680	Yeah.
8337680	8338880	The social media and all that stuff.
8338880	8341760	I still see deep, but I don't, you know, people come and come and go from the show.
8341760	8344480	I, and I appreciate both those guys immensely.
8344480	8348960	But the reality is he did it 15 years ago, but a lot's changed.
8348960	8352400	So yes, a new website is something that we really should work on.
8352960	8358000	So anyway, my point is if you try to send an email through the website, don't, uh, just
8358000	8361360	use your email client, participate at orange lounge, rated.com.
8361360	8365200	However, I can see why people would think that.
8365200	8366720	Why not just go to a website, clicking it.
8366720	8370400	So I have to figure out how to update that to give a, uh, heads up or something like
8370400	8370720	that.
8370720	8373600	It should just be a mail to link.
8375120	8380400	Um, Bobby black, Bobby black Wolf says, uh, gamertag radio was there day one respectfully.
8380400	8384320	And of course I, I re I realized they also have been running a very long time.
8384320	8385440	They've done more episodes.
8385440	8388160	I have nothing but respect for Danny and the work that he does.
8388720	8394320	I thought he came out after iTunes launched because that was what inspired him to go the
8394320	8395360	direction from what he was.
8395360	8398000	He was doing like a fantasy star thing before I could be wrong.
8398000	8404400	And if I am, I am sorry, but, um, and I'm sure, I'm sure there are also non video game
8404400	8406320	podcasts that have been there since day one.
8407360	8412320	Um, but, um, not many that's for sure.
8413280	8414640	So, all right.
8414640	8421120	Anyway, I, but I don't, I don't think it was very long after, um, some of the day one podcasts.
8422480	8426960	There was the one with the dudes in Cleveland, but they kind of faded, although they like
8426960	8428640	we'll do one show a year or something like that.
8428640	8434320	And again, please do not hear any of this as disrespect because it takes a lot of work
8434320	8436000	to do a show for one year.
8436000	8437840	And I have nothing but respect for the folks that do that.
8437840	8444560	But at the same time, we're, yes, we've been doing this for 19 years and we're going to
8444560	8445760	kind of toot that a little bit.
8445760	8446960	We're very proud of it.
8446960	8448000	You know, it takes it.
8448000	8448240	Yes.
8448240	8450080	It's taken a lot of dedication to go that long.
8450080	8454800	So to do Bobby says I showed up a month after iTunes.
8454800	8456560	I was month one, but not day one.
8457040	8460640	That still puts you in the old folks home, Bobby, as far as I'm concerned.
8460640	8463920	So it will be interesting to see what happens.
8463920	8466160	Should we ever decide to call it quits?
8466160	8468320	Who's still going at that time?
8468320	8472080	And, um, I, cause I don't know.
8472080	8478480	I, I'm, I'm very confident we are the longest running podcast about video games or internet
8478480	8481040	show, especially, especially when you combine all that together.
8481040	8482640	I don't know who's second place.
8483600	8484720	Y'all can fight about that.
8485600	8486080	I don't know.
8486640	8487440	All right.
8487440	8489120	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
8490240	8493360	Uh, I was going to get to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com.
8494320	8496160	Yes, there is one.
8496160	8496660	Yay.
8497440	8504160	Um, I don't have a nickname on it, so I'm just going to say Ronnie with Microsoft announcing
8504160	8506640	their avatars and virtual universe for teams.
8506640	8509520	Do you think PlayStation home was ahead of its time?
8509520	8514640	If Sony had stuck it out to this point, do you think there would have been opportunities
8514640	8518240	for them to utilize the service professionally during COVID?
8518240	8523040	Also, do you think AR tech missed a huge opportunity to advance during COVID?
8523040	8524320	I've been, uh, thanks.
8524320	8526960	I've been listening since life 365 days.
8526960	8527680	Wow.
8527680	8529680	This is my first time in mailbag.
8530720	8531200	Wow.
8532080	8533200	Well, hi Ronnie.
8533200	8533680	Well, hi.
8534480	8535760	We love a long time listener.
8535760	8536880	First time caller.
8536880	8537200	Wow.
8537200	8538160	That is a long time.
8538160	8541360	The live is five days that predates iTunes.
8541360	8541840	I think.
8542800	8544160	Yeah, no, it absolutely does.
8544160	8546400	Cause that's where we started there.
8546400	8550720	No, I know, but I'm trying to think where, remember there was about a year that we were
8550720	8553440	doing a podcast and a live show and then we combined.
8553440	8553940	Right.
8554720	8556800	I, we have the to go edition.
8556800	8559600	I think we were still on life 365 at that time.
8559600	8564080	But is this then when we were doing to go or was it when we were just doing orange
8564080	8566240	lounge radio and it's earlier iteration?
8566240	8567200	Probably both.
8568000	8571440	But anyway, I, I, cause, uh, all games didn't happen.
8575440	8577520	There was only one show when all games happen.
8577520	8578800	There was no more to go edition.
8578800	8580160	So it had to be, it had to be.
8580160	8580660	Yeah.
8581920	8582400	Yeah.
8582400	8582720	Yeah.
8582720	8584240	So the questions anyway.
8584240	8584740	Yes.
8585120	8586640	Um, so yes.
8586640	8588800	Going back to the question about, oh yes.
8588800	8590480	Was a PlayStation home ahead of its time?
8591520	8592720	Yes and no.
8592960	8598640	Um, I think there were features of home that were underutilized and undersold.
8598640	8602480	And then, and instead we got promises that never came to real fruition.
8603040	8608400	Um, such as like that virtual display case of the various achievements that you got.
8608400	8613040	You could get a shirt here and there in PlayStation home, but they never really
8613040	8618000	pushed that forward in the way that I think people really wanted to see.
8618000	8621360	But I think PlayStation, I think a lot of people would be into PlayStation home,
8621440	8623440	that type of thing, if it existed now.
8623440	8627520	And, um, I, I, you know, there's always been those rumors about, you know, oh, they're
8627520	8631600	going to do, uh, PlayStation is going to do their knockoff of VR chat and it's going to
8631600	8633920	be PlayStation home and PlayStation VR.
8633920	8635520	Um, I think that's nice.
8635520	8638640	I, I don't know if that would actually happen or not.
8638640	8642240	Um, my other big bitch about PlayStation home was that they should have let us have
8642240	8645680	more control over the clubhouses, but I think they were really paranoid about
8645680	8649040	copyright theft and things like that, but we could have done so much more with that
8649040	8649920	oil, our clubhouse.
8649920	8651920	So we've been giving a little more freedom.
8651920	8655120	Um, but there were, there were elements of it that were ahead of its time.
8655120	8655440	Yes.
8656080	8659520	And I think it would be a very interesting player if it was still around today.
8659520	8660240	Absolutely.
8661040	8666800	So thank you, Bobby, with the timeline, you came to all games in early 2006.
8666800	8669520	iTunes was June of 2005.
8669520	8674080	There was like a year period in there where everything happened very fast.
8675280	8677520	And there was a lot that happened really fast.
8677520	8679760	There was the launch of to go.
8679760	8684000	There was the launch of iTunes, which then shot up our listenership like crazy.
8684000	8688880	As far as podcasting goes, there was then live 365 up to all the rates.
8688880	8690400	So then we moved to all games.
8690400	8692800	But before that was the syndication on all games.
8692800	8696480	There was like a three or four month period where like they were playing our
8696480	8699440	show, but it was just a rerun, uh, kind of like DDR free grade.
8699440	8700160	It was doing back then.
8700160	8704720	There's just, there was a lot that happened in like a year, 18 month period
8704720	8707600	very quickly, um, that this all kind of falls into.
8707600	8710080	Anyway, thanks for the walk down memory lane.
8710080	8711120	And thank you for the email.
8711120	8715360	Um, Quest Buster says the Japanese PlayStation Home was really nice versus
8715360	8716240	the one in the States.
8716240	8718480	They gave away so much free stuff.
8718480	8719040	Yeah, I think.
8720480	8722080	I think you get out what you put into it.
8722080	8724800	And I think if Sony had put a little more into PlayStation Home, they would
8724800	8729280	have really seen the rewards they that year that they did the virtual E3 in
8729280	8734320	PlayStation Home was actually kind of interesting, uh, and kind of neat.
8734400	8738160	And it's a real, but I bet very few people actually experienced that because
8738160	8741440	there was just a lot of like, LOL PlayStation Home.
8741440	8743680	Remember we used to have that listener.
8743680	8744800	Definitely a former listener.
8744800	8746240	I think unfortunately he rage quit.
8746240	8747840	We said something he didn't agree with or something.
8747840	8749440	And, um, it happens.
8749440	8753360	Uh, he was like super into PlayStation Home and would call into the show and
8753360	8756000	talk about like all these things that PlayStation Home was doing.
8756000	8759680	And we, he were the guy and went to his PlayStation Home clubhouse and we were
8759680	8764000	actually kind of like, wow, you really can do a lot of cool shit in this game.
8764000	8766240	Like he had a really cool little thing laid out and everything.
8766240	8769280	And yeah, there was a lot you could do a PlayStation Home that just, I don't
8769280	8775440	think really broke through into the masses, like how to really explain that,
8775440	8777920	you know, and I think that's a big part of it as well.
8778560	8781680	Um, it's interesting though, if I remember the email, right.
8781680	8786720	Kind of brought up Microsoft teams and maybe Microsoft entering this space.
8787360	8793120	Um, I mean, it would be interesting, but it, since they're bringing it up in
8793200	8796640	teams, I think a lot of that has to do with the pandemic.
8797520	8801200	And maybe when we talk about PlayStation Home, we talk about what could that have
8801200	8804240	looked like if that was around when the pandemic started, that could have been
8804240	8806160	a very interesting sort of thing.
8806160	8810000	Um, but I feel like Microsoft's responses is nothing to do with gaming in which
8810000	8813840	you see in teams, but more a response to the pandemic and the reality of the
8813840	8818640	hybrid office model, if not completely work from home model that many people
8818640	8820320	are going to in the future.
8820320	8824800	Um, there's just, it's, it's instead of you work in the office or you work
8824800	8828080	at home, there's going to be a lot of people in a middle category very soon,
8828080	8828960	a hybrid model.
8829600	8833680	Um, and I think this like Microsoft teams, uh, changes there may is, is in
8833680	8835680	response to that, what it can do for gaming.
8836480	8836960	I don't know.
8839280	8842960	Uh, Zen monkey 11 in chat says, uh, Microsoft is already doing it.
8842960	8844480	It's called alt space VR.
8845760	8849440	It's I, I forgot about that Zen monkey until you mentioned it.
8849440	8851600	So Microsoft isn't really pushing it.
8851600	8855520	And so it's really about, you know, if Microsoft wants something like that
8855520	8859120	to be for gaming, they're going to really have to put that oomph behind it
8859120	8860720	that makes gamers want to check it out.
8861760	8864960	Unfortunately, a lot of experimental Microsoft products that really should
8864960	8867360	have stuck around also go away.
8867360	8869360	Uh, so this isn't something unique to Sony.
8870000	8872320	So let's have, let's have our weekly complaint.
8872960	8874640	Where's one versus 100.
8874640	8875520	That was awesome.
8876080	8877760	Where's Microsoft game room.
8877760	8881680	As far as selling me an emulator goes, that was probably one of the best they
8881680	8883760	ever did was Microsoft game room.
8883760	8888320	Like, so Microsoft isn't unique to walking away from these things that
8888320	8890320	should have been better fully realized.
8890320	8893920	But alas, that is the game industry we live in sometimes.
8893920	8896400	And the last, that was the only email we got, but thank you.
8896400	8897120	Longtime listener.
8897120	8900720	First time caller Ronnie for the email participate at orange launch,
8900720	8901280	rated.com.
8901280	8906560	If you want to send us an email for a future week, uh, and not the website.
8907760	8909120	I don't see anybody in the green room.
8909120	8910400	I'll give it to just another moment.
8910400	8915360	If you have any questions for us, uh, you can shout them out in our, um, uh,
8915360	8917920	Twitch chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
8918480	8920640	In the meantime, I want to check in with Loki and see if there's
8920640	8921680	any last minute stories.
8922640	8927280	Uh, the only thing I had is that apparently, uh, it looks like fail
8927280	8933440	overflow, the famous, um, cracking and hacking group has shown that they
8933440	8936240	can decrypt the PlayStation five firmware files.
8937120	8938160	Oh, interesting.
8939120	8941280	So what does that ultimately mean?
8941280	8943920	Does that mean they're going to try to do a home brew injection on
8943920	8944640	PlayStation five?
8944640	8946480	Or is that like, that's not emulation.
8946480	8949520	That's like home brew trying to run that stuff on PS five, right?
8949520	8949680	Yeah.
8949680	8955600	And they also, there's another, um, another screenshot from a PlayStation
8955600	8960640	actually showing debug settings enabled on the PlayStation five as well.
8960640	8963760	So, all right, we'll wait and see what happens.
8963760	8966960	All right.
8966960	8969360	Well, I still do not see anyone in the green room, so I don't think we're
8969360	8971760	getting any calls tonight and that is okay.
8971760	8974160	Uh, and then I don't really see any direct questions.
8974160	8977120	So, um, yeah, I think we, I think we kind of burned through all the news.
8977120	8978400	We had some good stuff.
8978400	8981600	Uh, Oh, Garth the Wolf in chat brings up the Endwalker delay, which I guess
8981600	8984800	I didn't really exist during the address during the show.
8984800	8987600	I thought I would get to it during my game week, but Garth the Wolf says
8987600	8990320	Endwalker delay is a relief because now I will actually have time to
8990320	8992720	complete my first relic weapon in Bozja.
8992720	8995840	I don't even know if I'll get around to that, but I will get all my jobs to
8995840	8996160	80.
8996160	8998880	I might hit 80 tonight on my last job after the show.
8998880	9002080	We'll see how, how long I have, uh, and if I have help.
9002080	9006400	Um, but, um, yeah, they delayed Endwalker by two weeks.
9006400	9009520	It was supposed to come out in early access, I think November 23rd.
9009520	9011680	And now it's pushed back to December 3rd.
9011680	9014640	And, uh, there was a big live letter that they did on Friday.
9014640	9017440	And, um, you know, they were talking about this and a lot of the other
9017440	9018480	changes of the game.
9018560	9023440	And, uh, Yoshi P, the producer director of Final Fantasy 14 looked so upset.
9023440	9025120	He looked like he was going to cry.
9025120	9028880	I wanted to hug him because it's not a big deal.
9028880	9030080	It's two weeks, whatever.
9030720	9034640	Do you, do you really, you guys have to remember Yoshi P is not only working
9034640	9039840	on Final Fantasy 14, the greatest turnaround in video game history.
9039840	9041440	I would put it above Diablo 3.
9041440	9042400	I really would.
9042400	9045600	Final Fantasy 14 is the greatest turnaround in gaming history.
9046560	9048160	Yoshi P is to credit for that.
9048160	9051680	And it's hardworking team, but there is a leader of that team and it's Yoshi P.
9051680	9057440	In addition to Final Fantasy 14, he is also working on Final Fantasy 16.
9058480	9060160	That man is fucking busy.
9061040	9067920	And to see him literally pour his heart out for all of us because QA issues and wanting
9067920	9072560	to make sure the game isn't fucked when it releases caused a two week delay.
9072560	9074160	Like I just, I wanted to hug him.
9074160	9078000	I felt so bad, but you know, and most people were understanding.
9078400	9083520	Probably 90%, you know, even higher were understanding, but of course there's going
9083520	9086960	to be those people that are like, I took the day off work and I'm very upset because I
9086960	9088320	can't get my PTO rearranged.
9088320	9091200	You guys are very upset to do this at the last minute is so rude.
9091200	9098080	Hey, hey, put your clown dress on tonight because you're the one that took time off
9098080	9098800	for an MMO.
9100320	9103200	And MMO launches are almost always bort.
9104000	9108480	And I'm not saying this to everyone who took time off for an MMO, because some people are
9108480	9110320	saying, oh, that sucks.
9110320	9112000	Guess I'll do something else.
9112000	9113360	That is the correct response.
9114880	9120080	But for the people that decide to tweet Yoshi P when he's literally crying on camera because
9120080	9124480	he has to delay his game, that I, what about me?
9128720	9129680	Shut the fuck up.
9130560	9130960	All right.
9130960	9137440	Uh, Mike Defton chat says, Yoshi P is a godsend and I don't even play Final Fantasy 14.
9137440	9140640	Garth the Wolf in chat says, Yoshi P cried while apologizing.
9140640	9141840	He shouldn't have to feel that way.
9141840	9143600	He's amazing and works so hard.
9143600	9147600	How many times has Yoshi P put his heart on his fucking sleeve this year when we don't
9147600	9148240	deserve it?
9148800	9153920	Remember that whole thing, uh, a fan fest when he was talking about Soken and everything
9153920	9155680	that Soken was going through medically.
9155680	9161440	And like, wait, gaming does not deserve Yoshi P.
9162000	9166320	And if you hurt that man's feelings, I will beat you up.
9166960	9169120	He is a, he's a perfect cinnamon roll.
9169120	9174800	I, I, I need to say for the purposes of Twitch, uh, rules and things I metaphorically, I will
9174800	9175300	beat you up.
9175840	9179120	I don't mean that literally for the purposes of Twitch things.
9179120	9179600	Yes.
9179600	9181840	I will beat you up with, with words.
9181840	9183280	Yoshi P is precious.
9183840	9185840	He is a gift in this gaming industry.
9186560	9190240	He is not here for your bullshit.
9190240	9191360	And I will see to that.
9193840	9197520	Comments in chat, DJ Rama S, are gamers entitled?
9197520	9197840	Yes.
9198480	9200640	Was that the website that Bobby had?
9200640	9202240	What was the website that Bobby had?
9202240	9204080	Are gamers mad?
9204080	9207440	Are gamers, do gamers hate, gamers hate everything.
9207440	9207760	That's it.
9207760	9208960	Gamers hate everything.com.
9210320	9211120	That, that was it.
9211760	9212800	It took me a minute.
9212800	9213600	My old brain.
9214400	9215440	Thank you, Bobby.
9215440	9216880	Gamers hate everything.com.
9216880	9217360	What?
9217360	9218960	You are not old gamer.
9218960	9220400	Your game is not old.
9220400	9224320	Can I, gamers are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.
9224320	9226240	Gamers are not, I forbid it.
9226240	9226960	What, you know what?
9226960	9233280	If I'm gonna, if I'm gonna wield that 19 year thing around the room and this whole like
9233280	9238000	where you know what, I'm going to decree that you are not allowed to hate Yoshi P.
9238880	9239440	Period.
9240800	9241840	You're not a gamer.
9241840	9243600	If you hate Yoshi P, you're not a gamer.
9244720	9245200	You're not.
9246400	9247760	I take, we take it away from you.
9247760	9249040	What do you say chat?
9249040	9253200	We, we strip away the gamer rights of those that hate Yoshi P.
9253760	9254880	Down with that.
9254880	9255520	How dare you?
9256800	9257120	All right.
9258080	9259360	Anyway, uh oh.
9259360	9261440	I guess the site is currently broken.
9261440	9264000	Gamer, gamers took out gamers hate everything.com.
9265360	9265840	Good lord.
9266800	9270720	Garth the Wolf would like to point out Final Fantasy 14 has the best stories to tell.
9270720	9272640	The lead writer of the game is a woman.
9272640	9273040	Yes.
9273040	9275600	Uh, who also wrote shadow ringers, which was incredible.
9275600	9277840	And the, the, the critically acclaimed MMO.
9277840	9278560	She's fabulous.
9279600	9280100	All right.
9280720	9281120	Anyway.
9282320	9282560	Okay.
9282560	9283440	I've said enough.
9283440	9283680	Yeah.
9283680	9284160	I'm sorry.
9284160	9284560	I'm sorry.
9284560	9288160	I had some thoughts and some feelings and some opinions and I had to express them.
9288720	9290160	You were entitled to that, Rob.
9290160	9292320	No one's saying no for the record.
9292320	9294160	You're joining me in this whole Yoshi.
9294160	9294880	You're not allowed.
9294880	9297280	If you hate Yoshi P, I will take your, you're not a gamer.
9297280	9298800	You, that title is taken away, right?
9299680	9301760	You're going to help me enforce this rule, right?
9302720	9303680	Yeah, Rob.
9303680	9303920	Sure.
9305440	9305760	All right.
9306480	9307280	What'd you want to say?
9307920	9310640	Oh, for the record, I didn't get to have a pink drink today.
9311520	9313040	I'm sorry for your loss.
9314000	9315600	I had a beige drink instead.
9315600	9316640	Oh, you poor thing.
9318160	9319040	I had a green tea.
9319920	9321040	My heart was broken, Rob.
9321680	9322880	Were they out of pink drink?
9323440	9323940	They were.
9324580	9330580	Um, so I had my, my fallback, which was my ice chai latte with one pump of the apple syrup.
9330580	9331540	Oh, good times.
9331540	9332020	Good times.
9332820	9333060	All right.
9333060	9333460	Delicious.
9333460	9334180	And I'm a genius.
9334820	9335140	All right.
9335620	9338900	Uh, Garth the Wolf in chat says chestnut praline latte is out.
9338900	9340580	Yeah, that's a really good, that's a really good.
9340580	9342340	I wish, wish I could get one soon.
9342340	9342740	All right.
9342740	9345460	Um, anyway, uh, let's, let's wrap up.
9345460	9349380	Um, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show tonight and listening to it and listening
9349380	9353300	to us make decrees and rules and bitch and complain.
9353300	9355140	This is our access.
9355140	9357780	Thank you for coming to our group therapy tonight.
9359540	9360740	We appreciate something.
9362580	9365940	Uh, that's, that's how the shows lasted 19 years.
9365940	9367700	It's basically therapy.
9367700	9369940	Uh, in a way it is sometimes.
9369940	9372820	Uh, anyway, thank you guys for being here and thank you for tuning in.
9372820	9376100	Whether you're like Ronnie and had been listening on the podcast feed for years and years and
9376100	9377300	years and years and years.
9377300	9378260	Thank you so much for that.
9378260	9383060	If you've been listening live here at twitch.tv, uh, thank you very much for that as well.
9383060	9383860	Appreciate you guys.
9383860	9385700	However, you choose to listen to the show.
9385700	9388660	If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.
9388660	9391220	Help us spread the word, a social media retweet.
9391220	9393620	Uh, those types of things go a long way as well.
9393620	9394660	Hosts on Twitch.
9395940	9398420	That whole system is kind of weird right now, but we'll take it.
9398420	9400100	If you want to host us on Twitch, please do.
9400100	9405300	For, for the record on that point, I'm going to say better TV house has an option for you
9405300	9408660	to add host channel when you are in somebody else's channel.
9409860	9412340	Oh, it is very useful.
9412340	9416260	If you're using better TTV and you don't see that it is an option that you can turn on
9416260	9417060	in your settings.
9417060	9420660	Is better TTV like an add on somebody wrote to fix all the problems with TTV.
9421540	9426500	Um, better TTV is actually for more icons than the standard, uh, ones that you get.
9426500	9429380	I was using it for my no bill icon for a long time.
9430500	9433380	And, uh, bourbon put up the no fang that I made.
9434740	9435300	Interesting.
9435300	9436020	I don't know about that.
9436580	9436900	Yeah.
9436900	9439620	I'll, I'll, I'll link you the stuff after I do my thing tonight.
9440180	9443140	I know about the pronouns add on for, but that's about the only
9443940	9448020	which doesn't work right in Safari.
9448740	9452420	Although a lot of those things run through tamper monkey, but that I digress.
9453380	9453940	Interesting.
9454500	9455140	Okay.
9455140	9458100	Um, but anyway, uh, thank you very much for your support.
9458100	9462260	If you feel so inclined, you can also visit the store, vog network.com slash shop, uh,
9462260	9464900	pick up an OLR t-shirt just in time for the holidays.
9464900	9468740	Say hello to a loved one with a Bobby black Wolf mug, which you can pick up at vog network.com
9468740	9472740	slash shop or a cool little vog network, logo, uh, anything.
9472740	9475540	Um, maybe we should add a couple items before the holidays.
9475540	9475940	We'll see.
9475940	9476580	We'll see.
9476580	9480580	Uh, maybe if you're good, uh, check that out at vog network.com slash shop.
9480580	9483540	And, uh, again, thank you so much for your support of the show.
9483540	9484980	It really does mean the world.
9484980	9487220	Uh, we'll be back next week to do it all again.
9487220	9488660	Before we say good night, good night.
9488660	9491380	We want to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9491380	9493540	So let me go to dark soccer at first.
9493540	9495780	I'll say, uh, your final thought first, before you head out.
9496420	9498340	My stomach hurts a lot because I ate too much.
9498340	9502020	I had a taco and I had a donut and the donuts were cheap and half price over at Safeway.
9502020	9509140	And I made a big mistake, choices, choices, but you got to eat a taco and a donut today
9509140	9510660	in a way pretty cool.
9511300	9513620	Remember no booping without consent.
9513620	9514420	All right.
9514420	9515300	Thank you to our soccer.
9515300	9519700	And, uh, we look forward to the boops on your stream and just a little later for live listeners.
9519700	9520180	So thanks.
9520180	9520680	Have a good one.
9521380	9521860	All right.
9521860	9523860	And Loki, how about your final thought?
9524820	9532420	Uh, my final thought is if you haven't already go subscribe to my YouTube channel, uh, username
9532420	9535780	Loki O R and check out my new video.
9536340	9540500	I've watched that, uh, time-lapse video that I filmed in there several times.
9540500	9542340	It syncs up so well to the music.
9542340	9543140	I love it.
9543140	9544020	Go check it out.
9544020	9545220	I made in Django city.
9545940	9546260	All right.
9546820	9548500	You know what you need to add to your channel though?
9548500	9553060	If you want to try to get more people, add some of your funny ass rants on things like
9553060	9553780	to your channel.
9553780	9558580	I think, I think you'd get a lot of just other, other audience that comes in non-Minecraft
9558580	9558820	people.
9558820	9561460	You got to reach the non-Minecraft crowd somehow, but yes.
9562100	9562820	All right.
9562820	9563540	Uh, check it out.
9563540	9565780	I, of course I encourage all of our folks to check it out.
9565780	9569220	Of course, of course you'll learn to love Minecraft with Loki.
9569220	9570900	Uh, I guess I'll plug my channel too.
9570900	9572660	I was very bad in broadcasting last week.
9572660	9574020	I promise I have a good reason.
9574020	9576740	I'm not going to talk about it right now, but I've just had a lot going on this last
9576740	9577220	week.
9577220	9581060	Um, but I I'm going to really try to get back on the wagon next week because I was doing
9581060	9582820	so good with my post-work streams.
9583140	9586260	So I'll plug myself at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.
9586260	9586980	Oh, and Twitter.
9586980	9588020	I fucking love Twitter.
9588020	9591300	Just follow me on Twitter at Mr Rob Roberts, Mr Rob Roberts.
9591300	9593220	Um, yeah, that's it.
9593220	9594980	That's going to do it for tonight's show.
9594980	9595380	Thank you.
9595940	9597620	Um, we'll be back to do it again.
9597620	9600900	I can't believe like it's November, 2021.
9600900	9608020	Like this time since we flipped to virtual has just flown by like this whole pandemic
9608020	9608740	stuff.
9608740	9610340	I get my booster next week.
9610340	9610900	That's exciting.
9610900	9612020	I got mine on Friday.
9612020	9612580	Congrats.
9612580	9615060	Did you get boosted with J and J or did you get something else?
9615060	9616180	No, Moderna.
9616180	9617540	I know you hate shots.
9617540	9618820	So that does take a lot.
9618820	9620020	I do hate shots.
9620020	9620580	Well, congrats.
9620580	9621300	Thank you for doing it.
9621940	9625140	It's like literally felt nothing from it.
9625140	9630180	My arm was very mildly sore the next day.
9630180	9630900	Oh, you didn't get it.
9630900	9632500	You didn't get any side effects from Moderna otherwise?
9632500	9632820	That's good.
9632820	9634340	Because I got no side effects.
9634340	9634900	I am good.
9634900	9636740	I'm getting tic-tac-toe with Moderna.
9636740	9640740	So I'm getting a Moderna shot on, uh, Thursday, I think.
9640740	9641140	No, no.
9641140	9641940	Thursday's a holiday.
9641940	9643620	So I think I might get it Tuesday.
9643620	9644020	I don't know.
9644020	9645860	I don't fucking know time anymore.
9645860	9647620	So but I'm going to get tic-tac-toe.
9647620	9649380	So I'll have Moderna, Moderna, Moderna.
9649380	9653220	So because that is my love of Dolly Parton and the vaccine
9653220	9654420	that she helped fund.
9654420	9656180	It's like getting the Moderna vaccine.
9657460	9658740	Get the vaccines.
9658740	9659380	We're fine.
9660100	9661300	You will be too.
9661300	9664180	And yes, Bobby Blackwell says, follow the VOG Network
9664180	9664980	Twitter as well.
9664980	9665380	Of course.
9666100	9668900	I just figured you already were at VOG Network.
9668900	9669940	Yes, yes.
9669940	9670820	All right.
9670820	9671860	Tic-tac-toe Derna.
9671860	9672100	Yes.
9672100	9674020	And Garth says that's Moderna is the half dose.
9674020	9674420	All right.
9674420	9675620	It's not vaccine launch radio.
9675620	9676260	It's Orange launch radio.
9676260	9676740	No, I'm sorry.
9676740	9677780	I didn't get Moderna.
9677780	9678900	I got Pfizer.
9678900	9680260	Oh, I confused myself.
9680260	9680760	Liar.
9681700	9685380	So I did get the Pfizer one and I felt nothing.
9685380	9687380	But the point is you got the booster.
9687380	9687860	I did.
9687860	9688340	You did.
9688340	9688660	All right.
9690020	9690420	Awesome.
9691140	9693220	Get vaccinated so we can have conventions again.
9693220	9694340	So we can have tournaments again.
9694340	9695620	We can have arcades again.
9695620	9697380	We've got to end this fucking pandemic.
9698740	9700740	At least where you're if you're going to, if you're
9700740	9703460	because I realize there are there is a very, very small
9703460	9705220	amount of people who literally can't get vaccinated
9705220	9706980	because, like, you know, they were recently on a medication
9706980	9707480	or something.
9708340	9709540	At least wear your masks.
9711540	9712180	Choose smart.
9712180	9712580	That's it.
9712580	9713540	I'll get off my soapbox.
9713540	9714740	We're going to end this episode.
9714740	9716660	We'll do another episode of Orange launch radio next week.
9717220	9718820	Who knows what rants we have in store.
9718820	9720740	We'll see what the gaming industry does to us over the
9720740	9721540	next seven days.
9722500	9724340	Listen to the Ubisoft employees.
9724340	9725940	Fire Yves Guumont.
9725940	9727380	That's not what they're saying, but that's what I'm saying.
9727380	9727780	Good night.
9728660	9731300	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
