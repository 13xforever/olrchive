1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,760
As I read the news this week, I was going to defend Streamlabs based on my own experiences

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,400
in open source software, forks, derivatives, and so on.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,040
Then I saw that they filed for the legal right of a name that includes OBS, and we all know

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,480
how well that worked out for In the Groove, which didn't even include the name DDR,

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,880
just the entire technical foundation of it.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,680
This is another story of foolish decisions.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,720
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you more

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,680
in this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,240
every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,680
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,960
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,920
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live with y'all once again, episode number 892

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,520
of our show, live on this November the 21st of 2021.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,120
Happy 19 November, 20 November to those back in the good old DDR days where the roots of

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,600
our show were made, and happy 21 November, even though I don't think that song actually

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,080
exists, but it should.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,760
Hi, I am Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, hello, who

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
is muted.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Let's try again.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Hello.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Crap.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Gosh.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Hi.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Hi.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
How are you doing?

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm okay.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I'm liking the new angle tonight.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
We get to see a little bit different angle of the lair of DarkSakura.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,840
I finally, I had the hardest time finding a clamp that could sit on my big widescreen

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
monitor.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,000
So finally I found a different kind of mount that I could clamp to the, you and I have

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
the same IKEA desk.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh yeah, that's right.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
I remember that.

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,520
So I have a clamp that now will sit up there and have my phone, because I use my iPhone

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,280
as my webcam because it's far better than any webcam on the market.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,440
And so I needed it a little bit more central and now it is, and people can see every time

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,120
I dip in, when I move with the camera, every time I try to kill people in Dead by Daylight.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,600
I need to get a mic arm for my office.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,400
I really like this one I have here in the old studio where we used to gather pre-COVID,

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
but I like this mic arm.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,120
I need something like this that'll hold my Elgato mic, because I just bought a new, now

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,600
I can't even remember the name of it, but it's Elgato's microphone.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,880
That's basically the response to Blue Yeti.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
And I heard good things about it.

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
It's nice.

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
I like it.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,320
It's what?

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,120
I was going to say the Audio-Technica one that I have is, actually mine came with my

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,160
arm and everything with it.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
And it's been an absolute delight.

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Gotcha.

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,300
Mike Deff says the Wave 3.

55
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Thank you.

56
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
That is the name of it.

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Thanks, Mike.

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
Hi.

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,400
And that is our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,280
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,480
I will, twitch.tv slash, no, I haven't, Vogue Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
show.

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,640
And of course, I'm going to say hello to Techmaster Loki and his mic arm as well.

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Hi, Loki.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Hello.

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
How are you doing?

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm doing fine.

68
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm a little tired because I've been staying up till three in the morning each day.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
I hear you've been working hard on that, Mike, because I know I've seen a lot of tweets.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,120
You've been really trying to kind of like wrap up your current storyline Minecraft so

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,920
you can move on to, I know you've got a new kind of thing for Minecraft, right?

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
So

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,440
I've been playing Minecraft, but I've actually been playing just on their server.

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, their certain aircraft, just to mess around.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,280
And so that's what I've been busy doing up until three in the morning.

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,240
But yes, this week, though, I did take off to actually work on that, because I do have

77
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
to finish up some builds.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,000
I already have the last two episodes of the season planned already.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,400
So I just have to do the things.

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,520
And I have one, thankfully, one of them is going to be a server tour, which is very low

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
effort.

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,360
No, I mean, it's not low effort, but it's just like, I don't have to build anything

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
else to design anything.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
So it goes quicker.

85
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:22,160
But I still have to finish polishing up my base a bit so that it's kind of complete,

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
you know.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,240
But yeah, it's gonna be fun.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Yeah.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,600
So, you know, a lot of people took off this next week for the holidays and all that stuff.

90
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
So, yeah.

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,080
Happy Thanksgiving to all the folks out there in OLR land, at least the ones in the States,

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Canada.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
You already had yours.

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,280
And Hanukkah is the week after.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Oh, that's right.

96
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,000
It's really early this year, relatively, isn't it?

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,680
Well, keep in mind, it follows a lunar calendar.

98
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,840
I know, but still.

99
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,040
But not everybody knows that, so that's why I'm saying it.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Yeah.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Yeah.

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,600
So it's the same reason why Easter, you know, changes every year because it actually follows

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,880
the same calendar that all the other Jewish holidays follow.

104
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Sure.

105
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,720
So, but my body doesn't follow or my work schedule don't follow the lunar calendar.

106
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,440
So it is a little novel to see Hanukkah in November.

107
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
That's not usually the way it is.

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
It's not the first time, though.

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm pretty sure I've seen it this early before.

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,980
It's been pretty funny because like all the last few years, it's actually been, if not

111
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,760
the same week as Christmas and awfully close to it.

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Right.

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,280
And which made everything easier for planning holiday stuff, but not this year.

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
So c'est la vie.

115
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
It is what it is.

116
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
That's okay.

117
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll still have latkes until the end of the year.

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
Yum, yum, yum.

119
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Wishing everyone, no matter where you are in the world, a happy Thanksgiving and in

120
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,040
the spirit of being thankful for, you know, the good things you have going on this year.

121
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,160
Hopefully, you know, it's been a year of a lot of ups and downs for me, but I try to

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,040
focus on the ups and being thankful.

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,880
And of course, I'm thankful for Sunday nights.

124
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I really am.

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm thankful to hang out here with you guys and talk about what's going on in gaming.

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm thankful for my co-hosts who are just as crazy as I am, quite frankly, when it comes

127
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,680
to having the dedication to do this for as long as we've been doing it, heading into

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,800
our 20th year in a few weeks, if you can believe it.

129
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
What were we thinking?

130
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,920
I don't know, but this, I'm going to be honest, like this has been a hard week to be a gaming

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
fan.

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,040
There's a lot, there's some hard news this week that's really, really frustrating.

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,160
And we're going to get into that in a minute.

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,100
Let me try to start with something positive.

135
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,840
How about we do a feedback sandwich?

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,720
We'll do positive, then we'll do negative, then we'll do our gaming weeks back to positive.

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,900
So let's start with positive.

138
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:50,120
I want to give a shout out to YYR, our listener who's here a lot and emails us a lot.

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,800
And you might remember our last, on last week's show, he said he was going to do a stream.

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,560
I only was able to catch a little bit of it via mobile because I was, I'm really focused

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,000
on my health and my walking and all that.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,720
And it just kind of happened to be around the same time, but I caught some of it.

143
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,460
And then I caught the big announcement, which we, I think I retweeted it on the OLR account,

144
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,680
but his game, so he's an indie game developer, right?

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,760
And you know, he developed the original Pixel Poops from an idea that came from Dark Sakura

146
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,960
and us here at OLR, which then Loki evolved into the sequel that he's talked about.

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,520
That's now featured in magazines as seen in Cool Shit Magazine, Pixel Poops number two.

148
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
I have, I have five copies coming.

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,720
I ordered a few copies to come in.

150
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
That's great.

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,640
Um, so, but of course YYR, he's developed other games.

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,160
He's got a lot of cool games that are out there on Steam and otherwise, you know, um,

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
I like falling as a, as a retro throwback, but one of the other big games he launched

154
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,620
is super multitasking, which I'm telling you guys, it's really good.

155
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,480
It's like playing WarioWare four times at once.

156
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Well, YYR announced on his stream, he's adding to it a dance game pad mode and get, it's,

157
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,080
it's not just controlling the existing games, but there's a dance game thrown in.

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
No, no, no.

159
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,300
What happens is that there's like a dance game that plays in the middle bar that you

160
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,720
have to step on the arrows and do all that shit.

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,620
Meanwhile, the other three lanes are still lighting up with games that you're playing

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,000
on your controller while you are dancing.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's brilliant.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
For fuck's sake.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's, it's brilliant.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
What does he think we're made of?

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,140
I don't understand why this game hasn't gone viral.

168
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
It's so good.

169
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,220
So super multitasking.

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,420
And I think you'd have to have the superpowers of a single mother.

171
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,560
So anyway, check that out on Steam if you haven't already over at super multitasking.

172
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Yay YYR.

173
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Yay, Aaron.

174
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Yay.

175
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Good news.

176
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Love that.

177
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,660
Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, I heard he threw down the gauntlet to Chris for life to try

178
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
it out.

179
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,060
Uh, yeah, he was tagged in that tweet.

180
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,220
So, uh, I thought that was, uh, pretty funny.

181
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
So I hope he does.

182
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
It's great.

183
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Okay.

184
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,500
Um, not so great news.

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Uh, let's get into it.

186
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Look here.

187
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,180
I know many of you at OLR, you know what's coming because you're tuned to gaming blogs.

188
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,180
You probably listen to other podcasts.

189
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,380
You are on social media.

190
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,460
So you know why I'm about to give a hearty fuck you to Bobby Kotick.

191
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,620
And in fact, it's at a point it needs to go further than that.

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,220
I'll get into that in a moment.

193
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,580
Um, and it's just this Activision story that will not quit.

194
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,300
And I think we all clearly see the reason why it will not quit.

195
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,660
That reason is becoming very apparent this week.

196
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,820
However, I know there's a handful of you that, you know, you're more casual gamers.

197
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,300
Maybe you don't follow all the headlines, but you listen to OLR cause you like me, Jamie

198
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
and Matt.

199
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Thank you for that.

200
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,580
Love ya.

201
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,820
This is a difficult content or this is a difficult topic.

202
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Content warning, everything like it's, it's, it's awful.

203
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,260
This, this is awful.

204
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I hate it.

205
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,580
And this is why I'm saying when it comes to being a gamer this week, this story sucks.

206
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:04,460
And the fact that it is not already resolved by his firing, his releasing sucks more.

207
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,020
Anyway, I've got plenty more rants coming.

208
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,740
Let's go to the facts.

209
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,140
Ricky, um, tell us about some of the things that have developed with the CEO of Activision

210
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,540
blizzards, King Bobby Kotick this week.

211
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Yeah.

212
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,180
So there was a report done by the wall street journal that kind of talked about some of

213
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,300
the allegations, um, that were happening kind of behind the whole California lawsuit.

214
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,020
And they said that over the years, um, that apparently Mr. Kotick has been accused by

215
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,980
several women of mistreatment, both inside and outside of the workplace.

216
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,600
And in some instances has worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly, which

217
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,340
you know, it sounds like a person with money would do so, uh, makes sense.

218
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:56,180
Um, he also apparently was, uh, there was a flight attendant that, or his private flight

219
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,140
jet flight attendant who was suing him for sexual harassment.

220
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,660
Um, that was committed, I guess, by the pilot of his jet saying, I'm going to destroy you.

221
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,340
Um, and then, yeah, just lots of different examples of that kind of stuff.

222
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,540
So that's, that's kind of the kicking off point right here is as if it wasn't bad enough

223
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
already.

224
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,460
Now there's this kind of a bombshell report.

225
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Sorry, Loki.

226
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm going to do this to you a lot.

227
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,940
I'm going to jump in because I'm not saying this in a, I was right kind of way, but I'm

228
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
saying this.

229
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,380
I, I hate that this has just proven true.

230
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:39,020
I said way back when, when this first started, I said, the culture of a company is set at

231
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,120
the top.

232
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,640
It's set at the very top.

233
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,280
And at the time I was pointing the finger a little bit of Bobby Kotek, I backed off

234
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,540
a little bit with that response that came up and I shouldn't have this, this news that's

235
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
coming out.

236
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,660
This just proves that shit culture was started at the top.

237
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Continue Loki.

238
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
Sorry.

239
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Oh no.

240
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
It gets worse.

241
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
It's not just him.

242
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,820
It's not just him, but then let's, let's get into some other details.

243
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:14,060
So we have former blizzard technology chief built Ben Kilgore, who was fired in 2018 and

244
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,660
after investigation for multiple allegations of sexual harassment, but he was thanked for

245
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,940
his many contribute contributions over the last four and a half years.

246
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,060
Javier Panamaino, who was the former supervisor at Sledgehammer Games.

247
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,500
And he was accused of raping one woman and sexually harassing a second one.

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:44,820
Apparently they had reported those instances to the HR and back in 2017, but they apparently

249
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,060
did not investigate the allegations or fire the supervisor.

250
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,580
Dan Bunting, co-head of Treyarch, which apparently he was accused of sexual harassing a female

251
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,060
coworker in 2017, after a night of drinking.

252
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,660
In 2019, an internal investigation reported that he recommended that he be fired, but

253
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,940
that Bobby Kotek intervened to prevent that firing and saying that after considering the

254
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,100
potential actions in light of that investigation, the company elected not to terminate Mr. Bunting,

255
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,500
but instead oppose other disciplinary measures.

256
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:27,380
So we have a lot of like all of the higher ups, just all of these harassment allegations.

257
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,020
I mean, there's a ton of smoke.

258
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,460
Because the culture was set at the top.

259
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,940
Yeah.

260
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,300
Disgusting.

261
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,660
And he's been protecting these people.

262
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,420
It's like, he's like best buds with Yves Guimond.

263
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,420
I mean, peas in a pod.

264
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
What about...

265
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Go ahead.

266
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Go ahead.

267
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Let Jamie speak.

268
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Go ahead.

269
00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm also going to add in, though, that this is what happens when men are raised with a

270
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,620
disrespect for women.

271
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,220
It starts at home and then corporate wide, it starts at the top, like you said.

272
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,540
It's a symptom of a bigger problem.

273
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,420
And we're now really seeing very obvious results of this.

274
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,020
This is why feminism exists.

275
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,620
Just saying right now, this is why we're not shutting up and this is why it gets louder

276
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,860
and louder.

277
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,540
So please continue.

278
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
Yeah.

279
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,580
So since he was found to be not only ignoring and downplaying harassment against female

280
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,500
employees for a very long time now.

281
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:49,380
So there were, of course, the Activision Blizzard employees there, the Workers Alliance,

282
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,100
that's basically said, you know, we're staging a walkout because we want him to resign.

283
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,960
And of course, he's not going to resign.

284
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,300
So they even put out a petition to have him quit as well.

285
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:09,600
They have twelve hundred signatures of different employees at the company.

286
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,920
I mean, clearly people want him to go, but he ain't going, unfortunately.

287
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Where's the part?

288
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,680
Can you can you skip to the part about Jen O'Neill and everything that she's been going

289
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
through?

290
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,600
Because this is the part to me that just underlines like this.

291
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,520
This is that he he is lying now.

292
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,120
This is not even like and when they when they come into this whole stuff about we're going

293
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
to fix it and these things are in the past.

294
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,900
No, bitch.

295
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,640
He has you all fooled.

296
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,220
He is lying now after everything came out.

297
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,340
He is still treating women like shit.

298
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
No.

299
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,300
So Jennifer, unequal pay and all this.

300
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Go ahead, Logie.

301
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Yeah.

302
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:00,020
So basically she had been there revealed that she had been sexually harassed at the company

303
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,980
earlier in her career and basically saying that I've been token tokenized, marginalized

304
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,140
and discriminated against.

305
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:15,940
And, you know, even attended, I guess, was a party in 2007 with Bobby Kotick in which

306
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,620
they had like, I guess, strippers dancing on stripper poles or something like that and

307
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,460
encourage female attendees to drink more so the men would have a better time.

308
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,940
So fun stuff.

309
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,600
I would like for him to just be castrated.

310
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,960
He needs he needs to go yesterday.

311
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:44,560
Bobby Kotick needed to be fired by the board yesterday and Monday or whenever this news

312
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,600
came out Monday, Tuesday, whatever happened, he should have been escorted out by the board

313
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
the next day.

314
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,180
I can't believe and I am enraged.

315
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,000
I am enraged as a gamer, as somebody, as a fucking human being that is sick of this shit.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,520
I am enraged that this motherfucker is still in power over at Activision Blizzard.

317
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Fuck him.

318
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,040
And I am fucking pissed that this board is enabling him, allowing him to stay in this

319
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
position.

320
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,000
Did you hear this story that broke three hours ago?

321
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can't wait for this.

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
You ready for a new twist?

323
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,020
Bobby Kotick, the Wall Street Journal, because they have they clearly clearly they are leaks

324
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
on.

325
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,920
There are very big leaks on the inside from people that recognize there is a big problem.

326
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,080
Well, the Wall Street Journal mentioned that Kotick met with Blizzard executives on Friday

327
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,220
and said, quote, he would consider leaving the company if he can't quickly fix the culture

328
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,860
problems at the video game giant.

329
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,480
From the Wall Street Journal report, Mr. Kotick, who has led Activision for three decades,

330
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,040
stopped short of saying he would step down in a Friday meeting with executives of the

331
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,380
company Blizzard Entertainment Unit, but left the possibility open if misconduct issues

332
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,140
around the company weren't fixed with speed.

333
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,000
These people said it has been 30 years.

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,260
Of this culture.

335
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,180
That Bobby Kotick has set the time for the killer is in the house.

336
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,420
The problem is in the house.

337
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:27,240
The issue is Bobby Kotick, who must go now.

338
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
And that's it.

339
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,500
And I am so enraged with this to a point, and I I will no longer stand by and enable

340
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,140
this company.

341
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,480
And I feel horrible saying this because I know people that work at Blizzard.

342
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,000
I know people that work at Activision.

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,480
I know people that were laid off at Blizzard while Bobby Kotick continued to receive a

344
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
huge bonus.

345
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
That's a whole other point.

346
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,020
And I know these are good people.

347
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,340
These are victims.

348
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,940
These are victims of this culture that Bobby Kotick is set.

349
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,340
Why doesn't the zero tolerance policy that was set apply to the man at the top?

350
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,980
Why is the board not applying that policy consistently?

351
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,780
And as far as I'm concerned, I want nothing to do with Activision Blizzard King until

352
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,780
this man is removed.

353
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,860
And when I say that, I mean, I'm not talking about their products on the show anymore.

354
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,240
And I know there's a lot of people that are going to say big fucking deal.

355
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,780
Nobody listens to your podcast anyway.

356
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
But you know what?

357
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,940
It's got to fucking start somewhere.

358
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,780
I am not going to stand by and promote this fucking culture until Bobby Kotick is gone.

359
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,980
Period.

360
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,040
So as far as I'm concerned, as excited as I was for Diablo 4, I regret buying Diablo

361
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
2.

362
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,200
I will no longer talk about those games on this show.

363
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,140
And it sucks.

364
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
As a fan of gaming and someone who is a gamer.

365
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,980
You want to hear about those companies?

366
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm sorry, but you're going to need to go somewhere else.

367
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
It's as simple as that.

368
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,760
And I'm sorry to my friends that work there.

369
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,300
And believe me, I've heard the other side.

370
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,740
You're not helping those people by boycotting these products.

371
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,580
This is where my conscience is at.

373
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,060
I cannot tell people to spend money that's going to ultimately end up in Bobby Kotick's

374
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
pocket.

375
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,700
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,720
It's not even just that because he's there.

377
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,780
He's actively hurting the company.

378
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:29,540
I mean, basically, both the heads of PlayStation and Xbox have been disturbed by what they've

379
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,180
been hearing.

380
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,180
And even Xbox, you know, they said, well, you know, basically, this type of behavior

381
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
has no place in industry.

382
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,820
And they said that even reconsidering their relationship with the company.

383
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
I appreciate that.

384
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,020
I realize he has to use softer language because it's corporate speak.

385
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,020
He can't say the things I'm saying now because he's the head of a very large gaming company.

386
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,460
But I respect the hell out of Phil Spencer for taking that stand.

387
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,240
I respect the hell out of him for saying, for not falling in line and letting the money

388
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,500
do the talking.

389
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,160
And for, you know, I'm sure Call of Duty or what the fuck ever Activision's got going

390
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,940
on in partnership with Xbox right now.

391
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,300
I've got a real respect for Phil Spencer to look in the face of all that and say, you

392
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,460
know what? Maybe we need to not.

393
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,460
So props to you and to be fair, Sony has made a I believe Sony made a similar statement

394
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
and I apologize.

395
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,620
I don't in the moment remember who, but I think that should be commended as well.

396
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,180
I don't want to give Microsoft all of the credit I want.

397
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,620
And this is the part that makes me feel a little better is that some of these other

398
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,060
people are now putting the pressure on.

399
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,780
And this, unfortunately, is the only thing the board is going to really be able to see.

400
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,620
It was the CEO, Jim Ryan.

401
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,740
Thank you. So thank you, Jim Ryan.

402
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,020
Thank you, Phil Spencer. Thank you for doing what needs to be done because I'm.

403
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,940
Yeah, money speaks.

404
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,180
If they're going to take the money out of the pocket, then that's what I'm down for.

405
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,100
Right. It's it's.

406
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:12,820
I'll put it this way, if I were to express exactly how angry I am, I would probably have

407
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,860
to do that and then go on a very long break.

408
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,020
And I want to make this very clear, even though I have said.

409
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,980
We are not going to cover Activision Blizzard King until this man is gone, which I'm hoping

410
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,940
will be a one week boycott, quite frankly.

411
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm hoping next week this this all reaches, but unfortunately, the time for this to happen

412
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,500
has already passed.

413
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,820
So I don't know if that's the holidays messing this all up or what, but I'm standing by

414
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,420
this. We're not talking about that company until that man is gone.

415
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,580
So and but here's the thing, and this is very important.

416
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,460
It is not my place.

417
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,700
It is not your place to tell other content creators what they can and cannot play.

418
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,740
I already told you that some people have a different outlook, that by not talking about

419
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,060
the products, you're hurting the frontline workers.

420
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,140
I think Bobby Kotick is a man that has already hurt frontline workers, and that's been

421
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,620
demonstrated from the layoff that he did prior while he still pocketed a large bonus with

422
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,180
that. So that's why that's a huge part of why I reached the conclusion that I did, is

423
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,500
that if Bobby Kotick wants a bonus, he'll he'll lay people off.

424
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,700
And that's really unfortunate and shitty.

425
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,060
But again, it's not up to us to tell other content creators what they can and cannot

426
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,940
cover. So I want to make that very clear.

427
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,980
If you have friends that are streaming Overwatch and continue to do so or whatever, then

428
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,340
you know what? More power to them.

429
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,460
For example, some some deep friends here of Orange Lounge Radio that used to be a part of

430
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,100
the Voice Geeks Network are pals over at Girls Gone Wow.

431
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,620
I fully expect them to continue their show and talk about this community that they love,

432
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,620
because some things are bigger than a video game.

433
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,820
And I think the community over there is probably the only thing that's been keeping

434
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,700
folks in check during all of this other bullshit that's been going on.

435
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,060
And I fully support that if they want to continue to talk about that community.

436
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,540
And honestly, it is a support group at this point.

437
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,940
I will say this for myself.

438
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:28,220
Yeah, if anybody has switched over, like on their stream to playing a game by that

439
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,260
company, I leave and stop posting.

440
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm not going to help anyone benefit from a company that has done this, if that makes

441
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,420
sense. That is my choice.

442
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,500
I get it. And again, I hope this is over by Tuesday.

443
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,220
I hope Bobby Kotick is out the door and we really have something to be thankful for in

444
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,260
this industry that the poison is finally cut out.

445
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,420
But until that happens, I'm digging my heels in.

446
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,420
I'm getting ready to die on this hill.

447
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,740
Once he's out, it still isn't going to be immediate.

448
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,220
No, it's not, but it's going to go a long way.

449
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,700
I think the first step, the board needs to be looked at as well for their failure to

450
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,300
act. But I get that there are nuances that make things a little more complicated than

451
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,140
that, but I'm still not happy.

452
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,260
Oh, no, I think that once he's gone, then the board needs to be evaluated.

453
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,860
I mean, if I had my way, there would be a third party oversight group that would step

454
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,020
in and manage the whole thing.

455
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,500
Agreed.

456
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,420
Because clearly those in power at this company cannot be trusted to do the right

457
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:55,460
thing. And I want to go on record saying that most this is something that's been a

458
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,820
problem in the corporate world for a very long time.

459
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:08,100
We would still have longer than eight hour work days and 40 hour work weeks and children

460
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,300
would still be working if it wasn't for the fact that we have legislation and third

461
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:19,580
parties who have stepped in to put companies in line because greed is greed and it never

462
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:26,260
goes away. Just just look at the history and I'm not going to go like on a big lesson

463
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,420
here, but look at the history of unionization.

464
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,620
Look at the history of labor in the US.

465
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,180
I mean, just look at why we have freaking Labor Day.

466
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:42,380
Yep. This is a problem that has been proven that if you if you leave something unchecked

467
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,700
like that, it is going to continue to run rampant until it until someone's hurt or many

468
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,220
someone's are hurt and then someone else has to check in.

469
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,660
And I I do hope from all of this, we really start to get that talk of that video game

470
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:05,260
union. And I hope that starts at Activision Blizzard King, because I do hope for my

471
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,180
friends that work there, I hope I truly hope the organization can come out stronger at

472
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,860
the end of this from employees having a seat at the table.

473
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,460
And from what I understand, that's what many of them have been asking for in the first

474
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,140
place. But obviously, Bobby Kotick being removed now is the first step in that

475
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:29,540
happening. I would also like to say for our friends that are in that employment

476
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,300
situation, don't be mad at the people who are boycotting.

477
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Be mad at the company you work for from putting them in that position.

478
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,140
This is this is this is a problem we have with your senior management and that and I

479
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,460
feel horrible for the people on the front lines.

480
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,500
I really do. I really do.

481
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,580
But this is something that they'll have to continue to address with with their HR to

482
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,860
make. And I would say this, too, if you are dealing and this is for any job, by the way,

483
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,620
if you are dealing with harassment of any variety at your work, document every last

484
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:11,580
thing, not just having, you know, a printout of not a printout, but like, you know, oh,

485
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
I went to HR on this day electronically.

486
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,900
No, you print that shit out.

487
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,420
You have a physical record of it.

488
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,620
It just and it's sorry, it just scrolled along the bottom that there's a report about

489
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,420
the guy at Activision Blizzard who signed all his emails, 1-800-ALLCOCK.

490
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,900
Document that, PDF it.

491
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,300
That's it took years for that person to get by, and that's just another just add it to

492
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,100
the dumpster fire seriously.

493
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:46,860
But but again, it is if you're remotely in a situation like that documented, it's going

494
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,700
to come back and you your document could help other people and it surely should have

495
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,740
been done with Activision for many more of the employees.

496
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,700
I mean, retrospect, you know, hindsight, but I'm saying that.

497
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:10,660
I'm glad to see what's coming out is coming out, but there needed to be something done

498
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,980
way too long ago, and that's really what has me angrier than anything, even if I am

499
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,860
not expressing things.

500
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:28,500
Loudly or verbally, passionately, my emotions are still there, and I am just simply trying

501
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,060
not to lose my shit because I am also angered.

502
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,220
Someone needs to stay calm while I'm over here yelling, it's fine.

503
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,420
I'm not I'm I'll put it this way, I'm not calm on the inside.

504
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,100
Fair, completely fair.

505
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Um, Bobby Kotick's bonus, that CEO bonus, the board bonus, they need to redistribute

506
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,380
that to the victims, the employees.

507
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,540
That's my other big for the employees.

508
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,180
Take that one hundred and fifty three million dollars and give it to the employees who've

509
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,180
been making those games, who've been working their ass off through all this bullshit.

510
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,380
It's just they should find him for back amounts.

511
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:15,860
I also the other shining light in this, which is so weird to say, is don't forget this

512
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,020
company is still under investigation by the state of California, and Bobby Kotick has

513
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,780
been subpoenaed.

514
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,900
I would love to see him locked up.

515
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,900
I mean, he's a man, he's a man and he's rich, so it's not going to happen.

516
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah, they're going to have an impossible time proving anything criminal.

517
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,980
But I would.

518
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,140
Well, especially in light of the verdict out of Wisconsin.

519
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,420
Yes, I would love to see.

520
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,180
I would love to see some justice in any sort of way at this point.

521
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,820
Well, that we all know is going to go to higher.

522
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,140
I just want him out of the gaming industry.

523
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,620
I want I want him out here.

524
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,380
I don't want him really going into another industry.

525
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,740
I want him. I want him to be never heard from again.

526
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,780
Yeah, all right, how about a nice bottomless pit somewhere?

527
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,980
I, I have I think we have to be very careful and say that we're using a lot of hyperbole.

528
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,940
Yes, we are. But I'm reminded of a Wendy Williams clip when she was talking about Ms.

529
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,980
and Mr. Spears.

530
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,900
I'm not going to repeat it because somebody will report it, even though it's hyperbole.

531
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,540
But that we know it, that's where my brain is right now.

532
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,940
How many times have we heard this in a certain mutual friend stream?

533
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,820
Yeah. Oh, yeah. When it when it when it comes to their careers, that clip.

534
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,220
Yes. Although, however, if he was on fire, I wouldn't offer any water.

535
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,060
Quest Buster and I say that also is hyperbole.

536
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,700
Quest Buster in chat says, as a weird side note, ATVI stock price has fallen

537
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,860
30 percent since news of the investigation broke this summer, allowing Roblox to pass

538
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
them in value a few days ago. Good.

539
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,540
That's that's where it's going to hurt them the most.

540
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,580
And if you're holding Activision Blizzard stock, I would encourage you to sell it.

541
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,540
I even made a tweet earlier this week.

542
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,820
I was like, we need a movement like what we had with the whole like GameStop and AMC

543
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,820
thing where we we need to hit Activision Blizzard there and make sure the stock stock

544
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,460
is being sold off in mass.

545
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,860
I somebody had replied to me and said that's not but I think they kind of

546
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,540
misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying we need to buy the stock.

547
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm saying we need to be pushing this narrative within the financial media and

548
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,860
within the financial markets and making sure that this is giving coverage on

549
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,740
financial media so that people sell their stock and unload it.

550
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,540
And that's that's going to do the talking, unfortunately, at the end of the day.

551
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,140
But I will say we need to have some sort of financial devaluation enacted.

552
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,980
But I will say I was at the gas station getting way too expensive gas in my

553
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,300
thankfully hybrid car.

554
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,860
You know how the gas station plays those little TV things that show you the weather

555
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,900
and headlines and stuff?

556
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,420
Guess what? This was the headline they were talking about at the gas station.

557
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,020
So, you know what?

558
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,900
I usually just walk off and ignore those things.

559
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,060
Well, I've seen I've seen they're pumping my gas starts.

560
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,460
I have lots of gas.

561
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,380
But gas has automatic things on them now.

562
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,260
True, true. All right.

563
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:37,180
Anyway. OK, I know anything else to add here, any other negativity palette or

564
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,860
something? Well, no, we'll get to another story.

565
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,420
We'll go to our gaming weeks and we're done here.

566
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,940
But I just want to make sure we've talked about everything.

567
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,660
Yes, pretty much the only thing I was going to mention also is the organization

568
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,220
girls who code was partnered with Activision and obviously severed their ties

569
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,940
because of all the crap that's going on.

570
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,980
It's kind of hard to be partnered with a company like that.

571
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,460
This time, you think you think under understand that call.

572
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,260
Much love to girls who code.

573
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,340
Much love to them. E3VL pointing out in chat, Call of Duty sales dropped 40 percent

574
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,420
compared to last year.

575
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,580
That's another game stocks.

576
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,140
But that that's totally different.

577
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,460
All right. All right. That's actually not different.

578
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,020
It's what else is doing basically.

579
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,940
But it shouldn't hurt the cause.

580
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,060
Right. To have it be such a.

581
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:32,340
Piece of shit. And remember, that was Bobby, that was Bobby Kotex call to pull

582
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,020
all of the studios to work on that flop.

583
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,260
Just food for thought, that was Bobby Kotex call.

584
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,860
So if you all if you financial peeps are mad about that, guess who needs to go?

585
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,340
By the way, there's a lot of other hideous shit he's been involved with that you should

586
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,620
look at anyway. I'm done.

587
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,300
I promise. Let's cleanse our palate.

588
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,820
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and talk about some happy things like I'm sure Dark

589
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,020
Sakura is going to talk about murder in video games, in video games.

590
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,140
Yes, I did murder some people.

591
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,500
I, of course, played Dead by Daylight because I stream it.

592
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,780
I also at least patched my Animal Crossing.

593
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,980
So I'm taking steps.

594
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,180
And of course, Fantasian, I did like a little bit of a grindy grind, I actually had to

595
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,380
start my my stream for it a little bit late, and so I just played around and did some

596
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,100
quests and some stuff like that.

597
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:44,860
But I'm I'm having thoughts about the state of Dead by Daylight, and it's kind of not

598
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,100
quite what I think some of the other streamers are saying, because there's a lot of

599
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,420
stuff that they're saying about it, kind of ad nauseam.

600
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:01,020
And I am now at the point where I'm just like, if a game is going, you know, if if

601
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,300
people are going to be shit, if MMR is going to be shit, if all of this is just going to

602
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,580
be the ultimate in garbage, then fuck it, I'll meme.

603
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:14,980
Let my MMR get low, let me start winning some more games, then have it get shitty again,

604
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,340
and then I'll meme some more.

605
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,780
At this point, I'm kind of done with the complaining about it.

606
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:31,940
I want I want Karina to come out already, I want my artist who has an amazing backstory

607
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,580
and an amazing level and is an amazing character designed to boot.

608
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,580
I'm so excited.

609
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,060
Also, dear Hawkins Laboratory, rest in fucking hell.

610
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,060
That's right, that the map was finally removed this week, as the Stranger Things

611
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,180
characters no longer purchasable in the store, they are they're gone.

612
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,820
And although you can still play them a game if you if you had them from before, there's

613
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:05,340
more to it, because their perks are now generic, you can no longer adept challenge

614
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,100
them, which means I won't see any more fucking adept Steves.

615
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,940
I didn't realize that.

616
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,900
Well, that's sad, because I never got those achievements.

617
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,700
But well, the achievements don't exist.

618
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,220
Oh, they are gone, removed for everybody.

619
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,420
Oh, wow. OK, so you're off the hook, Rob.

620
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,340
I didn't is that I mean, I'm sure that's true on like Steam and the PC places.

621
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,740
Is that true on Microsoft?

622
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:35,020
And that should be true everywhere, because I think it wasn't I think it was was a hydro

623
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,260
that was doing adept challenges the other day.

624
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,140
Oh, he does a lot of either hydro or merit or Meru love hydro.

625
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,500
Shout out to hydro. Yeah, hydro is awesome.

626
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,780
But it was either hydro or Meru, because those are the two people that I usually will

627
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,740
watch earlier in the day and went to go look.

628
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,220
And the the achievements for them were gone.

629
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:03,380
And indeed, I think if I go and look at my because I have a Stadia achievement thing on

630
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,660
here. Right, right.

631
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,180
And I am looking at my adept list for survivors.

632
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,980
And I I don't see them on the adept list at all.

633
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,460
I'm actually going to resort my list in alphabetical order.

634
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,180
Bobby Blackwolf and chat says, I wonder if you lose gamerscore when they delete

635
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,780
achievements. That's why I'm fascinated with this concept.

636
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,540
I I'm not familiar with games deleting achievements.

637
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,580
I I would think that maybe the people who earned them probably keep them, even if they

638
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,260
don't show, they might be in a hidden category, but they probably just don't show up as

639
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,980
achievable for new people. But even then, that's also kind of fascinating to me in a way.

640
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:46,180
Well, OK, so I looked it over and yeah, they are completely off of the list.

641
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,100
There is no more adept for them at all, even on Stadia's readouts.

642
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,220
Interesting. OK, that's fascinating to me.

643
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,740
I also thought I got adept trapper.

644
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm sad that I didn't.

645
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,700
Oh, well, I was like, why isn't that on my unlock list?

646
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,780
Oh, I must not have gotten it.

647
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
All right. Anything else for you?

648
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:15,980
I guess that when I do my my mental breakdown streaming, which will be every day while I'm

649
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,660
on medical leave, except for when I do my labs and I'll talk a little bit about that.

650
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,100
I maybe might try to do adept challenges for killers.

651
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,060
And my mental breakdown will be televised.

652
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,700
Just if you need to step away, please step away, you know, do what you need to do, take

653
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
care of Jamie first.

654
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,220
I think it's going to be hilarious because when I'm not on my meds, I'm either super

655
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,780
funny or I'm so pathetic that I'm super funny to bullies.

656
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,420
Oh, boy. All right.

657
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,300
Just don't want to see you.

658
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,300
I'm trying to have a good sense of humor about it.

659
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,580
And that's good, but I just don't want to see you broadcast something you will wish you

660
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,380
had later on.

661
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,700
I'll I'll know better.

662
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,780
Yeah, good. All right.

663
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,220
Let's head over to Loki.

664
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,940
How was your gaming week, Loki?

665
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,500
It's all Minecraft.

666
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,860
It's always Minecraft.

667
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,740
This week, though, I did put out a new video, so that was pretty good.

668
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:21,940
I got more done on my base and then the it's not covered in this week, so I'll go ahead

669
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:27,700
and say it. Then the news came out that the the next update for Minecraft 118 is coming

670
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,580
out on the 30th.

671
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,060
And so that screwed up all my timetables because I thought, oh, I've got like four more

672
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,460
weeks. And I was planning on doing like some really elaborate things.

673
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:46,860
And it's like. Damn it, by the way, which is fine, because what I wanted to do probably

674
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,860
once again, overscoping the idea, I want to get into animation as well.

675
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,180
But I think it would take in too long and it would just be very hard to do.

676
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,700
It would've been cool. But the new the new plans now are better.

677
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:08,220
And it's kind of exciting going into the next season and being able to hang out with the

678
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,820
people on the server this weekend and actually have voice chats with people like that's

679
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,300
just something that I thought I would be doing on my current server.

680
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,540
But now it's kind of fun and then also pissing off somebody because I built a shop on

681
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,380
top of their pumpkin.

682
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,300
But, you know, Minecraft drama.

683
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,740
So, yeah, I'm just going to be finishing up stuff this week and finishing up the build

684
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,860
for that. Also starting planning for next season as well and just kind of.

685
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,500
You know, diving right into that once we get started, I think it's probably going to be a

686
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,220
couple of weeks. Well, whenever the server version is available.

687
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,500
So usually about the week after.

688
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,460
So hopefully it'll be starting a new season in like two weeks.

689
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,780
Awesome. Yeah, look forward to more videos.

690
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,340
Good luck to you. Hope the new server works out well.

691
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,540
I know. I know getting discovered is always the challenge.

692
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,820
It's one we've been facing here at OLR for a long time, but I hope I hope you get it.

693
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,420
I hope you get that spark that breaks through.

694
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,500
I really do. So my gaming week, I guess I'll follow up to the Dead by Daylight talk.

695
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,780
I've also been playing a little bit.

696
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,260
I've been kind of getting back into killer, oddly enough, even though I don't love getting

697
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,260
bullied sometimes because I'm not great at killer.

698
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,700
I think I think, Jamie, I've reached a similar conclusion, a different way.

699
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,100
I'm just kind of in that point where I'm like, I don't care if I lose, like if I lose.

700
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,020
So what? Like the only person that knows is me and maybe the people that bullied me, but

701
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,980
it's whatever. They'll just go on to the next match.

702
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,340
I stopped considering it as losing.

703
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,700
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

704
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,780
That's true. It's just a game.

705
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,900
You know, it's if you had fun, then you won.

706
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,980
And if you bring no edge, you'll almost always at least get one kill.

707
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,700
But and if you bring no ed and people bitch about it, you can then go, oh, how dare I use

708
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,060
a perk that was programmed into the game intended to be used by the developers.

709
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,820
Bring Soul Guard. Cleanse your damn totems.

710
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,500
Yeah. Easy asses.

711
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,420
I will. No, you're fine.

712
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,740
But funny enough, the killer that I'm like super into right now, I actually don't have

713
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,500
no ed on. It just hasn't come up in the roulette web.

714
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,300
I am super fond of Pinhead right now is like the killer.

715
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,940
I really enjoy playing like I yes, I find the chain mechanic and all that stuff extremely

716
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,740
satisfying. I love that when they go do the box, if you aren't chasing anyone else, you

717
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,700
get like a free teleport right to smash the survivor.

718
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,780
There's a lot about it.

719
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,900
And like when people fuck up Pinhead's mechanic, the entire match snowballs for them.

720
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,500
And I had a match like that last night where it was like nobody bothered to open the box

721
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,420
I found the box is Pinhead.

722
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,700
So basically when you're playing for those who don't know Dead by Daylight, when when the

723
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:53,060
survivors are doing the thing, yeah, you have to you have about 60 seconds every so often

724
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,180
to solve the lament configuration.

725
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,500
And this is a thing out of the movies.

726
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,580
And if you don't solve it, basically chains start showing up everywhere.

727
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,020
And not only do they slow you down, but now the killer can see the chains.

728
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,860
So I as the killer know where you are because I hear the chains go off.

729
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:14,260
And then even to make that even worse, if you don't solve the box in 60 seconds, if I find it

730
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,260
first and I as Pinhead solved the lament configuration, then all of you scream, I

731
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,940
instantly know where you all are located and you go right into the chain phase for at least 30

732
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,500
seconds until a new box spawns.

733
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,900
I as Pinhead cannot see where the box spawns.

734
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,980
I have to come across it.

735
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,620
Normally the survivors, they can all see it and let there is an add on that makes it a lot

736
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,500
harder to find.

737
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,980
But I don't run that out on because it doesn't pop up very often for me.

738
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,980
But yeah, I love I don't know.

739
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,940
I'm like super into Pinhead.

740
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,500
It's weird.

741
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,300
So and I when somebody drops a palette, I love like because the other big mechanic is that you

742
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,900
can like you basically separate from your body to throw a chain.

743
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,140
So you do this thing where you like project out where you want the chain to start and then the

744
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,740
camera flips to where the chain is and you can drive the chain hopefully into selfies.

745
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,060
Do you do hook selfies?

746
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,580
I do palette selfies.

747
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,780
When somebody throws a palette down, I'm waiting there.

748
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,980
I'm I start with the hook and I'm waiting there to release the button.

749
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,380
And then when they drop the palette, release, chain them right on the other side of the palette.

750
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,100
But I mean, where you take the screenshot.

751
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,100
Oh, no, I don't do the screenshot.

752
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,060
No, no, no, that's clever.

753
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,340
Yeah, if you can stand next to the hook and then you throw the chain and it turns the camera

754
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:33,660
around and which is really funky because when you play as a killer and there are two boundary

755
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,660
breaks, by the way, and I'm glad one of them showed what it looks like when you play killer and

756
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,660
you go into like a third person perspective when you should be in your first person's perspective.

757
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,020
And it shows how like their body is skewed, you know, a certain way.

758
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:55,100
I think it's funny that it readjusts to the way a survivor sees it when you when you do that.

759
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,460
I mean, I guess it kind of has to.

760
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,500
But I think it's interesting just how quickly it happens.

761
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,220
It is, you know, I love like behind the scenes stuff like that.

762
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,700
Real quick update on the achievement front in our chat.

763
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,980
Bobby Black Wolf is in chat.

764
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,980
The good Bobby, who says, OK, yeah, it looks like they didn't delete the achievements.

765
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,860
This is on Xbox.

766
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,340
He's just did the research there.

767
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:14,820
He didn't research.

768
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:20,740
They didn't delete the achievements more than they renamed them and gave them different unlock criteria.

769
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,860
So that's kind of interesting.

770
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:27,140
So they probably, instead of making it Adept Steve, probably made it get out with these three perks.

771
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,380
And it's just some whatever.

772
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,580
Bobby says Steve did the rename too.

773
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:38,540
That's interesting, because I thought I mean, there are already challenges to get out with certain.

774
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,900
I mean, I guess that is the way to redo the Adept, but it's not you could do that with any character now.

775
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,580
Interesting.

776
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:53,860
So Bobby Black Wolf says the achievement so alone, which I am assuming is the Steve Adept, because that sounds like him, is now Operation Survival in a public match repair.

777
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,540
Oh, no, that's in a public match.

778
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,740
Repair the generator in the treatment theaters, operation theater and escape.

779
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,380
Oh, that's oh, but that's probably that was probably the Hawkins achievement before.

780
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,540
And they moved it to Larry's.

781
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,780
That's probably what that one is.

782
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,980
That actually makes sense.

783
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,620
That makes a lot of areas because they're sort of the same kind of.

784
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,340
Yeah, they're very similar map being indoors.

785
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,420
Yes. Interesting.

786
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,900
OK, moving on.

787
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,900
I have other games to talk about, so I've also been playing Final Fantasy 14.

788
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,580
That expansion should have been out by now, but it was delayed and that's OK.

789
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,500
I don't remember if I mentioned on the show, but I got all my jobs.

790
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,620
I hit that goal of getting everything to 80.

791
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,340
So I'm ready for the expansion.

792
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:37,900
Now I'm just doing Moogle tome runs and trying to get more mounts and just upping my collection, getting ready for Endwalker, which early access is December 3rd.

793
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,460
I'm very excited about that.

794
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:45,660
So, yeah, I was playing a little more Forza Horizon five, which is still a great game.

795
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,620
I was playing that a little bit earlier in the week.

796
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:54,100
And then later this week, on Friday, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were released.

797
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,420
And I picked up Brilliant Diamond, which seems to be the one a lot of people are getting in retrospect, looking at my friends list.

798
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,980
I wish I'd got Shining Pearl, but there's more Pokemon I like and diamond.

799
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,780
So I've been playing that.

800
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,860
And yeah, I'm already through the second gym.

801
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:16,020
I say already, like some of you guys have probably already beaten the game, but for me, that's good progress.

802
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,180
And I'm just enjoying playing Pokemon.

803
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,420
I love the quality of life stuff.

804
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,420
I know some of the purists can't stand it.

805
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,740
Respectfully, you're wrong.

806
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:32,820
These are great changes, for example, the experience share being there and on by default from the very beginning without it being explained.

807
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,740
Fantastic.

808
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,220
Love that experience share is such an important part of Pokemon.

809
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,300
I don't understand.

810
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:44,900
Yeah, I think you're just living in the dark ages or you just clamor for an old game from the mid 90s if you're still tied to that.

811
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,020
So I love that that's there by default.

812
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,020
The changes that they did to the underground to make more Pokemon available sooner are pretty cool.

813
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,900
And yeah, I'm just I'm just enjoying playing the game.

814
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
I'm having a good time with a Pokemon game.

815
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:02,580
Mike Defton chat says, I'm stuck at the beginning, shining, shiny hunting for a starter.

816
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,260
Well, that's that's you.

817
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:11,700
Shane was doing a similar thing, I think, but he gave up that intro sequence before you get the starter.

818
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,300
That takes a while.

819
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,220
Like you don't just start the game and get a starter.

820
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,180
You have to kind of go through the town you started and then go up the trail.

821
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,100
It takes a minute to get there.

822
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,940
So I can see how resetting is a pain in the ass.

823
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:33,660
E3VL points out if you have Let's Go and Sword and Shield, if you have those save files on the switch, you can get Mew and Jirachi.

824
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,500
That is true.

825
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,860
You don't see them until you get to the flower town.

826
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,540
But there's an old man and an old woman in the flower town.

827
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,780
And the old man will give you Jirachi for having Sword and Shield.

828
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,580
And the old woman will give you Mew for having Let's Go.

829
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,700
I have them both.

830
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:52,340
And Jirachi, at least as of right now, is on my team because I enjoy enjoy that one.

831
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,340
So, yeah, I've been enjoying Pokemon.

832
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,340
I don't know what else to say.

833
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,820
It's a Pokemon game. It's fun.

834
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,260
I'm enjoying it. We'll see.

835
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,060
We'll see if I stick with it all the way to the end.

836
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:10,740
I have a weird feeling it'll probably take me a year to beat it just because when Final Fantasy 14 expansion comes out, everything else is on hold.

837
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,860
And you are not going to hear me talk about anything else for at least four weeks or until I get to the end of the story.

838
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,660
It is what it is.

839
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,740
We all have our thing.

840
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,500
That is my thing.

841
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,260
Dark Sakura's got Dead by Daylight.

842
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,180
Loki's got Minecraft.

843
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,260
I got Final Fantasy 14.

844
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,660
OK, I should get back into playing.

845
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,900
You should. It's fine.

846
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,380
I'm sure the expansion is going to be great.

847
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,980
I'm paying for it.

848
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,300
Oh, yeah.

849
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:40,140
All right, let's get into some more gaming news and we'll start with an update to the big headline from last week, right, Loki?

850
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,260
Yeah, so the Grand Theft Auto trilogy Definitive Edition is a pile of garbage.

851
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,380
Yeah, that's that's still a thing.

852
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:53,300
And I don't I don't know what to make of this.

853
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,700
It's just stupid.

854
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:15,340
So apparently they put Rockstar Games put out a post on a Rockstar news wire, whatever, saying that, hey, we are aware of the issues and, you know, there is a title update that's going on right now and it'll fix a number of the issues.

855
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:27,260
And in the meantime, we're going to put up the older classic versions of Grand Theft Auto three Vice City in San Andreas that are those are going to be available to purchase.

856
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:36,340
And then also for anybody who purchased the definitive edition will also get those from the store.

857
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,220
I guess they'll receive those until, I guess, June 30th, 2022.

858
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,300
So if you purchase the definitive edition between them, you'll get that classic version at no additional cost.

859
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,140
Oh, how generous of you.

860
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,180
Thank you.

861
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,700
Then, of course, they said that, you know.

862
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:05,100
The update versions, updated versions of these classic games did not launch in the state that meets our own standards of quality or the standards our fans have come to expect.

863
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,700
Excuse me.

864
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,900
Excuse me.

865
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:21,540
You're a company that develops very complicated, well polished games, and you were unaware of the quality or you didn't believe that they met your standards.

866
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,300
Well, guess what?

867
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,020
You as a company or publisher can say, yeah, that doesn't meet our standards.

868
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,460
We're not publishing that right now.

869
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,580
We're going to delay it, let it go.

870
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,420
But you made the decision to release it in the state that it was.

871
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,060
So this either tells me you're complete fucking stupid or you just don't fucking care.

872
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,460
Take either one.

873
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,340
It doesn't matter.

874
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:44,860
They don't.

875
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,260
It's just it's garbage.

876
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,620
This is ridiculous that, oh, it wasn't up to our standards.

877
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,660
Well, no kidding.

878
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:00,340
I mean, you obviously somebody had to have been playing it or getting updates.

879
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,860
You weren't completely going into this blind like, what?

880
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,100
It was looking like that and we just let it go out.

881
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,700
I don't believe that for one minute.

882
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:21,380
I also I bet the QA department, I bet the quality because there's going to be people out there that still don't get it and they're going to sit there and say, doesn't don't they have a quality assurance department?

883
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,940
Aren't they doing their jobs?

884
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,100
And yes, they do.

885
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,020
And they are.

886
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,020
But guess what?

887
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:31,740
Sometimes you report those things to the top and they go, ah, we have a minimum viable product.

888
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,140
We'll release it and patch it later.

889
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,380
That is the decision of the senior and that folks.

890
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:36,660
Yeah.

891
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,580
And that is not the way to release stuff nowadays.

892
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,820
I know it seems like, oh, well, we've got a shoddy shell of a game put out through a patch it later.

893
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,220
OK, well, we're going to remember that when the next game comes out.

894
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,660
And of course, there's still the lawsuits that they're filing against modders for different things.

895
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:09,700
So I know right now that there are they're fighting the lawsuits right now for RE3 and RE Vice City, which were reverse engineered clean room source code.

896
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,860
So it was basically kind of seeing how the game works and figuring it out in the back end and redoing it.

897
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:30,460
And so basically saying that, you know, any complained copying of code protected material that did occur, if any, was undertaken to allow for interoperability of the software and fixing bugs.

898
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:41,020
But such actions comprising reverse engineering are transformative use is what they're alleging, which I agree.

899
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:48,660
I think if they are coming up with completely unique code that basically runs the game in a similar manner.

900
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:56,900
Then there's not really much they can do about it unless they were actually ripping out the code from the game and popping it into theirs.

901
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,380
I mean, it. I don't know.

902
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,900
It's stupid.

903
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:08,380
As 100 Mountain Chat says, this was a side project that didn't have a huge staff, I imagine that was pushed out to get out something for the holidays.

904
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,460
Again, a call from the top.

905
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:16,140
And why are we so I mean, they don't have something for the holidays because they have granted auto online.

906
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,820
They have grants.

907
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,020
They're making tons of money from that.

908
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,340
They don't need to push this out.

909
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,060
How much money does this obviously that does this possibly make for them?

910
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:30,260
Didn't Switch show us that the holidays do not have to be the end all be all of video game releases?

911
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,180
I mean, I get it.

912
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,900
Yes, there is a lot of retail.

913
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,860
But OK, you know what?

914
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,820
Covid has fucked everything up.

915
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,900
If you have to delay it for a few months.

916
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,220
Oh, well.

917
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,580
Release it in April.

918
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,460
And I bet there'll be a lot of people who'd still buy it if the product is good.

919
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,940
I just feel like it's mind blowing to me how people literally die on the hill of getting the game out for the holiday.

920
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,700
I know y'all are going to go to fiscal year.

922
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,900
Got to get the stocks.

923
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,940
Has to be out before April or doesn't go to.

924
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

925
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,460
But do you think this helped?

926
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,780
Do you think this is going to end up being a good thing for them at the end of the day?

927
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,260
Well, this is not.

928
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:16,140
It's like, look at they knew what the the studio, the quality of the studio, they had this studio do mobile versions of these games.

929
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:23,220
And then they they instead of remastering the console versions for this definitive edition,

930
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,300
they remastered the mobile versions, which were like adapted from the console version.

931
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,020
So it's like a copy of a copy.

932
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,620
You can't tell me that they didn't know that they had issues with it.

933
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:41,100
I mean, like, just can you not like I'm going to put the original game on one screen.

934
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:47,140
I'm going to put the piece of shit that I'm working on right now and I'm going to look at them and go, damn, that doesn't look good.

935
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,540
Maybe I should fix that.

936
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,220
Oh, someone looked at it.

937
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,580
Loki, someone looked at it.

938
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,140
It's just somebody else didn't care.

939
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,500
Stupid like like the rain textures that they had were like super high res for what it is like.

940
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,700
It shouldn't be that high level.

941
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,620
The texture file for that shouldn't be that big.

942
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,660
And they were using something ridiculously large.

943
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,460
I mean, even the rain, just like the opacity just need to be fixed on that.

944
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,900
I heard modders are actually taking care of that stuff.

945
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,740
I mean, it's just of course.

946
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,620
And it's weird, too.

947
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:23,380
It's like even and even with this, like the San Andreas rain looks like garbage.

948
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,380
And I think freeze rain looks like garbage.

949
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,780
But Vice City, not so bad.

950
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,820
Like, there's not even consistency between the different games that they have.

951
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,140
And you can't tell me it's because they're running on different engines because they're not.

952
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,780
They're all basically the same.

953
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,700
It's just if these are like graphical assets, it shouldn't matter

954
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,820
how, you know, they can just adjust the texture file that's being used for this.

955
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,100
I don't. I don't know.

956
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,100
It's just so stupid.

957
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,020
They're like, I don't want to.

958
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,460
And that's it. That's why.

959
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,540
It's just it's low effort.

960
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,620
It was an incredibly low effort port.

961
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,660
Of another port that they put in there, it's because that's what they do.

962
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,700
They're not going they're not going to.

963
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,580
I don't even know why put this out, like why?

964
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,740
Why even bother putting this out at this point?

965
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,660
Like, I don't understand.

966
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,700
Just put it put a sale out for your other games or something.

967
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:21,220
Like, I don't know why you need the definitive edition of this,

968
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,220
which is kind of where they ended up now is that they are doing a sale

969
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,500
on those original games or they put the original games back

970
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,020
after taking them down, right? Right.

971
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,380
Yeah, it just got I don't know. It's stupid.

972
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,020
It's because they thought they could print money.

973
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,220
And it backfired.

974
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,780
All right. Let's move on and talk about

975
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,020
this is pretty big news in the competitive fighting game circuit,

976
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,980
and that is, you know, of course, Nintendo has shut down a lot of,

977
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,540
you know, Smash Brothers tournaments because they were running on that

978
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,740
modded thing and so forth.

979
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,060
Well, very interesting development this week in a tweet from

980
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,380
a group of folks that organize tournaments.

981
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,500
Panda, who is at Panda Global on Twitter, tweeted out,

982
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,340
We are proud to announce our partnership with Nintendo in 2022.

983
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,460
Panda will be bringing the first officially licensed circuit

984
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,900
for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and Super Smash Brothers Melee

985
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,700
to North America.

986
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,940
That's the part that has a lot of people raising their eyebrows because

987
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:28,260
they've they they tagged Nintendo in the tweet.

988
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:32,140
They've they've given Nintendo coin or something's happened here.

989
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,740
And Nintendo is essentially endorsing Super Smash Brothers Melee

990
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,900
as a competitive platform, even though the ultimate is up there as well.

991
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:45,020
It feels like Nintendo was resisting that for a long time.

992
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,460
I don't know if this is because Ultimate is now finished.

993
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,500
I'm using my quotey fingers finished because all the DLC

994
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,060
is out there at this point or what the deal is.

995
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,500
But very fascinating, to be quite honest.

996
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,020
They did point out more details for this short series of events.

997
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:06,620
I'm not sure what they mean by that with cash prizes is coming very soon.

998
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,940
So that's that's pretty awesome.

999
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,980
Hmm. Yeah, just maybe they wanted the new games showcase,

1000
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,220
and so they agreed to do the new game and the old game as well.

1001
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,260
Yeah, which I would have which I would have figured would have been part of it.

1002
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,740
And Mike Defton chat says this is actually huge, like so freaking huge.

1003
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,180
Yes. But if you're in that fighting game circuit, I have seen people

1004
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,460
who do play Smash and on a somewhat competitive level that are like kind

1005
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,700
of tweeting like like, whoa, at this type of news that's going on.

1006
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,940
This is a big deal.

1007
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,540
The fact that you're going to have an official Nintendo Smash

1008
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,780
Brothers Melee tournament in the year, assumably 2022.

1009
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,500
You know what, 20 years almost after almost 20 years after it was released.

1010
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,780
That is a pretty big deal.

1011
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,100
And especially after Nintendo, you know, was shut, shutting down modders

1012
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,460
and really kind of was perceived to anyway

1013
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,700
really be burying melee in favor of ultimate.

1014
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,140
So this is this is very, very interesting.

1015
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,580
That is very specifically on their terms.

1016
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,700
And that that honestly could be it as well.

1017
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,300
And maybe Nintendo, to some expect, kind of realizes

1018
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,420
they have to do this because they can't exactly stop the modders.

1019
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,220
But if they can get a company to partner with that's willing to do cash prizes

1020
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,340
for this, then this is the one people are going to work for.

1021
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,860
And I think that's also a big thing.

1022
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,700
If you're going to get a cash prize from being the best in a melee

1023
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,060
version of this, it's in one that's Nintendo acknowledged.

1024
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,180
Nonetheless, it's going to make it more attractive

1025
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,500
to train to and compete to.

1026
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,620
I'm not saying it's going to do away with mods.

1027
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,340
You'll never you'll never do away with mods.

1028
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,340
And there's always going to be a fan, you know, fans for that scene

1029
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,220
and all that stuff.

1030
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,780
But it's going to mod. Yeah.

1031
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,100
But I think it's going to they're going to pull people away from that

1032
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,940
in this more, quote unquote, legit thing, which I think is interesting.

1033
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:02,020
SSG 100 map saying Nintendo was hesitant to get into the tournament scene.

1034
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,980
They were shutting down a ton of tournaments until recent years.

1035
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,780
Even now, they only mildly tolerated tournaments.

1036
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,740
Now they're actually partnering with a legit e-sports group

1037
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,980
to put something out.

1038
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,060
Mike Deaf follows that up and says, yeah, Hungrybox actually got emotional

1039
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,820
about this. Well, this is, you know,

1040
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,060
if this is something that's been like underground for a long time

1041
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,940
and have it's it's nice for Nintendo to kind of fucking acknowledge it.

1042
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,820
So kudos to everybody that that everybody that stood by

1043
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,780
that 20 year old game while everybody was saying, why are you just

1044
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,380
why are you playing such a goddamn old game?

1045
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,500
Get over it. Play the new shit.

1046
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,260
For those of you guys out there that stuck with it, congratulations.

1047
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,260
You know, you're proud of yourself.

1048
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,540
You're getting a hug this week.

1049
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,900
And I to some extent, I get it like the modded thing.

1050
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,100
I kind of always understood why Nintendo shut that down.

1051
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,300
You may not like it,

1052
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,860
but Nintendo completely was in the legal right to shut that down.

1053
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,460
The unmodded like local game store tournaments on melee.

1054
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,900
Like what's what's the problem, Nintendo?

1055
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,980
What's the problem if it bothered if it bothered you that much?

1056
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,180
Sell copies of melee, which, by the way,

1057
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:18,020
a lot of people are thinking this might lead to that is that.

1058
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,340
Oh, now that Smash Brothers Ultimate is done

1059
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,060
and there's this whole audience that wants to do melee

1060
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,660
and do it competitively, let's sell them the game again on the switch.

1061
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,780
That doesn't actually sound far off.

1062
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,340
I. I holiday 2022.

1063
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,740
What do you bet? Now the game on the switch or sell them

1064
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,380
a subscription to Nintendo online services is going to include that game in there.

1065
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,860
No, no, they're not going to.

1066
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,100
No, no, no. They won't Netflix the GameCube games.

1067
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,780
They're going to sell them separately.

1068
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,740
But you know what?

1069
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:56,900
If this opens the door, the pop, if this opens the door to F-Zero GX

1070
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,220
being also one of those games that comes out on a GameCube thing,

1071
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
I'm going to allow it.

1072
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,500
That's the reality. All right.

1073
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,300
Pod culture and chat says melee ultimate remastered.

1074
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,660
See, I think the community would reject that immediately

1075
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,820
if if it is not frame by frame.

1076
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,140
Perfect to the original.

1077
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,220
The community will reject it.

1078
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,620
The definitive edition.

1079
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,820
Yeah. Now I change how it plays ready to work on another game.

1080
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:31,460
Yeah. Vicarious visions before they were purchased by an evil company.

1081
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:36,660
Did what was considered to be a pretty relatively good remaster

1082
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,900
where you just hit a button to toggle between the two.

1083
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,220
If that's the direction Nintendo wants to go with it. Cool.

1084
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,620
But yeah, it's.

1085
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,620
All right. Let's move on to our soccer.

1086
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,580
How about more rumors?

1087
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,180
We love rumors on Thanksgiving week when the news is slower.

1088
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,660
Well, CD Projekt,

1089
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,740
there was like a little bit of a leak out there

1090
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,180
that had a trailer.

1091
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,820
It was actually included in a trailer for Cyberpunk 2077

1092
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:14,180
that there would be links to using Xbox Game Pass

1093
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,700
and it would be available via the game pass.

1094
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,020
And they're like, nope, we didn't do that.

1095
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,380
That's a rumor. Stop.

1096
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,140
And that actually direct quote says there are no game pass plans

1097
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,260
for Cyberpunk 2077.

1098
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,820
But it was there, you know, there was the mention.

1099
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,340
It makes me think that at some point

1100
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,660
they actually did have some sort of discussion about it.

1101
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,860
The DLC delays are also not coming out.

1102
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,460
Well, sorry, the DLC is for this year has been delayed until next year.

1103
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,740
The new titles that are coming out for

1104
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,580
Xbox Game Pass will actually just for this month is Grand Theft Auto

1105
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,180
San Andreas, the Definitive Edition.

1106
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,060
It takes two Forza Horizon five and Evil Genius two.

1107
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,500
Nice. Yeah.

1108
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,540
I'd grab Cyberpunk if it came out on Game Pass.

1109
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,700
I wish it would. I get it.

1110
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,540
You know why? Why?

1111
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,180
It's not your kind of game.

1112
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,700
Oh, I don't have the Xbox. Oh.

1113
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,620
That's why I would not, because I cannot.

1114
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,380
I'm not I'm also completely not mad about it.

1115
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,420
I still don't have a PlayStation five, and I kind of want to remedy that.

1116
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,940
But I'm at the point where I'm like, OK,

1117
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,220
maybe they'll do a pro next year.

1118
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,900
But the reality is when Final Fantasy 16 is dated,

1119
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,500
I will get a PlayStation five period. So.

1120
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:43,620
All right. If you can, if you can find one, that's always the the major caveat.

1121
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,740
Don't remind me. All right.

1122
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,220
Let's move on, Loki.

1123
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,260
So basically, according to Tom Henderson,

1124
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,740
DICE had pitched Battlefield three, but it was rejected

1125
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,180
by EA due to the cost of using the Star Wars license.

1126
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:07,340
I got turned down because it takes 20 percent more sales to make the same money.

1127
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,020
So instead, they're going to work on another Battlefield game.

1128
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:16,060
Like Battlefield 2042, the one that just got released

1129
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,420
and also has the most is the worst reviewed game on Steam.

1130
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,660
That that series.

1131
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,340
You know, the the battlefield Call of Duty, I guess.

1132
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:32,260
Tiger Claw on chat says, probably because EA got burned

1133
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,460
by what happened with Battlefront two. Well, whose fault was that?

1134
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,340
Whose fault was that was your fault and not for,

1135
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,620
you know, not embracing the wonderful world of loot boxes.

1136
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,020
Don't you like surprises?

1137
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,220
I hate how disconnected executives

1138
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,100
are at these companies from fucking reality.

1139
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,060
It blows my mind.

1140
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,700
It blows that was a requirement to being an executive.

1141
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,540
Any three VL in chat says current Battlefield is buggy.

1142
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,180
Oh, yeah, we've been hearing about that.

1143
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,180
I mean, that's not the type of game I play, but I've definitely been hearing about that.

1144
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,140
Another thing I've been hearing about quite a bit this week

1145
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,060
has to do with a little company called Stream Labs.

1146
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:18,740
Oh, boy. So, oh, boy.

1147
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,540
There's a lot that Stream Labs really got a good dragging,

1148
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,700
a hair pulling on social media this week, and it started with plagiarism

1149
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,420
accusations, basically.

1150
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,260
There they've been working on a product that's very similar to Lightstream,

1151
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:41,940
which is where you can stream without the need of a capture card.

1152
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,300
I think it just kind of pulls from like a I don't know how it actually works.

1153
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,580
I don't know if it's going through your mobile device or streaming like on

1154
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,620
like your I think you're streaming it on your device to like a server

1155
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,940
that then, you know, you you go through and broadcast on.

1156
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,740
I haven't really had to look into it

1157
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,100
because I am fortunate enough to have a capture card.

1158
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,460
It's a thing that does stuff.

1159
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,100
But Stream Labs was going to launch their own version of it.

1160
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:11,420
And boy, oh boy, did Lightstream call them out on their bullshit.

1161
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,420
They they put out a tweet that was like when the other kid copies your homework.

1162
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,460
And I'm telling you, the Stream Labs launch page was like, copy, copy

1163
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,740
down to the testament quotes.

1164
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,500
And of course, Stream Labs put out this apology that was like it was

1165
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,980
something that was supposed to be a test page

1166
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,300
that was not supposed to go into production well. Right.

1167
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,580
Well, but all right.

1168
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,980
I am going to take a step back.

1169
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,740
Change the text and change the fonts.

1170
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,180
Actually, I will tell you,

1171
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:45,900
I have copied and pasted the layout for the sake of setting up my layout.

1172
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:49,460
I will typically not copy and paste text

1173
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,180
and just do like the lorem ipsum text.

1174
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,220
But I I'm not going to fault.

1175
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,140
That is a statement.

1176
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,660
But I am going to say it's fucking lazy on their designers

1177
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,860
part to have done it verbatim.

1178
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:10,140
Well, and also like it's not the fact is it's that coupled with the fact

1179
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,500
that Stream Labs is essentially building off a knockoff software

1180
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,140
of the page they stole that that isn't I think the problem

1181
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,100
is that it's those two things together that make it really ugly.

1182
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,740
If they knocked off some other person's website for this product,

1183
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:27,700
then, you know, they're still kind of, you know, being lazy.

1184
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,780
But at least they showed that there were multiple sources of inspiration

1185
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,860
and not just one.

1186
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,300
The other problem is then, oh, my God, the floodgates opened up.

1187
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,620
So then OBS sent out a tweet this week that was like, yeah.

1188
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,500
So we asked while we're spilling tea. Yeah.

1189
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:49,100
What's while we're doing a dragging while we're doing a public,

1190
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,700
you know, yoinking of Stream Labs,

1191
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,900
we asked them not to use OBS in their name and they did it anyway. OOP.

1192
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,340
In response, they trademarked it.

1193
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,940
Yeah. Oh, that was the other.

1194
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,780
Oh, that was really shady, too.

1195
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:07,820
In response, Stream Labs sent out a lovely little white text

1196
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,980
on a black background tweet,

1197
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,260
which is this is the part that blows my mind.

1198
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,860
What they wrote is big enough for an actual tweet,

1199
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,700
but they decided to do the white text on black background.

1200
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,820
OK, go off, because they probably copied it from somebody else.

1201
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,980
They do a scream saying

1202
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,100
it's it's done for effect.

1203
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:31,300
We are taking immediate action to remove OBS from our name.

1204
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,260
Stream Labs OBS is built on top of the OBS open source platform.

1205
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:39,300
Stream Labs OBS is also open source and our code is publicly available.

1206
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,180
We take responsibility for our actions and will support the community.

1207
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:48,100
I mean, this is the equivalent of like that scene from Game of Thrones

1208
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,300
where she's having to parade naked through the town

1209
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,260
and everybody's ringing the bell going shame, shame.

1210
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,580
That is what's happening to Stream Labs right now.

1211
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,660
And it's it just it just makes it feel like their entire business

1212
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,140
is built on copying other people's homework.

1213
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,580
But the first time that's happened, I've been trying to

1214
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:12,340
when you're entangled, though, in the Stream Labs ecosystem.

1215
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,980
Disentangling yourself is a pain in the ass.

1216
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,900
Yeah, because I'm having to do that right now.

1217
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,100
I've already, you know, my personal merch store away from it,

1218
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,460
you know, which honestly, we'll talk about that offline,

1219
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,620
but it was really easy to do.

1220
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:30,380
But, you know, all of my because I use cloud bot, you know,

1221
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,500
changing everything over is not easy and they kind of make it that way.

1222
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:40,020
Elgato also dragged them because I believe Stream Labs

1223
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,340
is launching an app that basically does the same thing as a stream deck.

1224
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:48,460
So, yeah, everybody's ringing their bells like now is the time.

1225
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,220
I think I think Festivus came early this year

1226
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,900
because everyone's airing their grievances against Stream Labs.

1227
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,500
Interesting side effect

1228
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,300
that hits close to home here at Orange Lounge Radio

1229
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,060
and Vogue Network, where we broadcast every Sunday night.

1230
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:08,940
We had a year agreement through Stream Labs Space.

1231
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,900
Well, not agreement because it wasn't like a contract or anything,

1232
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,420
but basically we bought a year of Stream Labs Pro

1233
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,260
so that we could sell the merchandise.

1234
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,260
You know, I always plug the shop at the end of the show.

1235
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,060
That contract was set to be renewed on the sorry, not contract,

1236
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:25,940
but you know, the agreement agreement was set to be renewed on Friday.

1237
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:31,900
Bobby made an executive decision, which I supported, to not renew the agreement.

1238
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,100
Henceforth, there is no Vogue Network shop anymore.

1239
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,460
Actually, my understanding is it is still there.

1240
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,260
However, I cannot endorse it because I don't know

1241
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,300
if we will actually make money off of it at this point.

1242
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,620
So I'm not going to be sharing that link right now.

1243
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,300
That's why Dark Soccer hinted we need to talk offline,

1244
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,980
because an interesting sort of thing, the timer timer came up on Stream Labs.

1245
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,660
We have opted, you know what?

1246
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,620
Y'all are messy.

1247
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,860
We don't need to do messy.

1248
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:05,100
So we're going to we miss seeing this without y'all.

1249
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,740
And I think you're on the right track, Dark Soccer,

1250
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,740
when you talk about untangling a little bit.

1251
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,380
So we're going to move the merch store somewhere else

1252
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,300
and we're going to be doing stream elements.

1253
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:20,140
Bobby is doing a test tonight on stream elements

1254
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,540
to make sure that a lot of the stuff that's kind of magic

1255
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,740
that runs behind the scenes,

1256
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,860
such as the bits and subs that scroll on the bottom

1257
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,020
so people get their shout outs and all that.

1258
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,620
He's actually running a test right now during tonight

1259
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,380
to see if it's everything's cool, like nothing breaks or whatever.

1260
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:40,060
And we are looking at making the motion to change over to stream elements,

1261
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,260
at least for that component after this week.

1262
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,900
The hardest part that I see with all of that are because, you know,

1263
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:52,180
I have my my shout commands.

1264
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:53,940
Not my shout commands.

1265
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,100
I mean, those I think I can move over pretty easy

1266
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,220
if I use Chrome because there's a tool that does it.

1267
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:01,380
But the ones that I'm really the most concerned about

1268
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,460
are going to be like my sound alerts.

1269
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,180
That I set up in slobs streamlabs ODS,

1270
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,100
which thankfully they're changing that name, but it doesn't work with stadia.

1271
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,060
And I'm not the only person who notices how buggy their freaking app is

1272
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,780
and what a resource hog it is.

1273
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:22,220
Yeah, I, I tried I use it just for setting stuff up.

1274
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,860
I tried slobs for like five seconds because I will admit

1275
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,780
they have some really nice built in templates.

1276
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,580
Now, of course, when everybody has access to those templates,

1277
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,140
you don't look so unique.

1278
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,660
But it it was not running efficiently.

1279
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,980
Like I was getting frame skips.

1280
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,180
It was not running well on my computer, so I went back to OBS.

1281
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,460
Like it was like I think I maybe did one test stream in that.

1282
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,540
And I was like, nah, this isn't for me.

1283
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,580
It was the only way that I could possibly use chat bot because I'm on a Mac.

1284
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,820
I am proud of being on a Mac, but.

1285
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,500
They don't make chat bot chat bot for for Mac,

1286
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,660
and since I'm on an M1, I can't run it through crossover.

1287
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,580
So or or even emulated in wine.

1288
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,860
So I have to use cloud bot.

1289
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:07,860
And as it is, I'm going to be going over to whatever

1290
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,940
stream elements users or go to nightbot like a bunch of people do.

1291
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,140
So but yeah, if anyone doesn't think that there's anything

1292
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:19,620
if you're a new streamer and you only think that it's streamlabs,

1293
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,620
you've got alternatives.

1294
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:25,700
Even Twitch has their own stream thing that you can use as well.

1295
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,580
That I think might be back, by the way.

1296
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,980
Oh, I think it might be built on top of OBS.

1297
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,140
I can't remember, but there it is built on OBS.

1298
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,620
Yeah, there are plenty of options out there.

1299
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,980
Just so folks know.

1300
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,180
Anyway, and when I'll say one last thing about stream elements

1301
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,780
for other streamers out there, they offer

1302
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,420
um, uh,

1303
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:47,420
sponsored streaming opportunities like left and right.

1304
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,140
Oh, neat. Yeah. Yeah.

1305
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,940
I you know, we're going to look into that.

1306
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,060
I do really like the idea that their merch shop

1307
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,740
allows you to give discounts to people who subscribe.

1308
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,740
I kind of love that.

1309
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,300
But I know you really enjoy the quality of the merch

1310
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,260
that the store you've been working with has been putting out.

1311
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,380
So we'll figure it out. We'll come we'll figure out.

1312
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,620
But either way, you can actually do broader coupons with spring.

1313
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,300
I think. But yeah, offline.

1314
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,220
But either way, sorry, y'all.

1315
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,020
But the shop is closed just in time for the holiday shopping season.

1316
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,460
Love that for us.

1317
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,540
But it'll come back bigger and better as soon as we can.

1318
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,260
So there you go.

1319
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,740
Let's see. I also want to point out,

1320
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:32,100
Dark Tetsuya in chat said, good to know you'll move the shop elsewhere.

1321
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,340
Oh, yeah, we're not going to we don't want to get rid of ways

1322
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,540
for you guys to help us financially pay for things like stream labs

1323
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,220
that we end up canceling.

1324
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,700
Hello, we like money.

1325
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,580
I mean, we like keeping the show afloat.

1326
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,340
Yeah, exactly. Running a business takes a lot of money.

1327
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,500
And again, we really, really want to get back into live conventions

1328
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,180
and all that good stuff. Anyway,

1329
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,980
Dark Tetsuya says haven't been able to get a shirt or anything just yet

1330
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:56,820
for various reasons, but hopefully by the time it finds a new home,

1331
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,380
I'll be able to. I'm hoping in the next month or so,

1332
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,540
we have this all figured if if that I I bet we're talking about this

1333
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:06,420
in a week or two, which is we're going to miss

1334
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,260
we're going to miss the biggest shopping day of the year.

1335
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,940
Oh, well, sorry, guys. All right.

1336
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,900
Let's move on. For the record, if I do recall correctly,

1337
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,380
I think that you can have a limited number of merch

1338
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,580
that you can share through the free version.

1339
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,220
Oh, that's cool, because having a merch shop,

1340
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,980
they they make money off of it regardless.

1341
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,780
Oh, they sure do. Of course they do.

1342
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,540
Yes. So if I do recall correctly,

1343
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,580
you just have fewer things you can have on your storefront.

1344
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:36,740
All righty, let's move on and let's get back into games and less drama.

1345
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:43,860
Dark Sakura. Well, general good guy all around Phil Spencer,

1346
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:49,780
he has come out on record saying that he believes that a large focus

1347
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:54,300
on video game preservation in the industry is a good idea

1348
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:59,060
that he hopes to turn to emulation to preserve these games.

1349
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:03,100
I'll read the quote. My hope and I think I have to present it that way

1350
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,980
as of now is as an industry would work on legal emulation

1351
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:10,420
that allowed modern hardware to run any within reason,

1352
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:17,020
older executable, allowing someone to play any game there.

1353
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:23,020
And there is some backwards compatibility in a relatively limited fashion.

1354
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:27,500
Nintendo certainly, I think, has been the leader at this

1355
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:34,780
with their online library of the NES, Genesis, all that stuff up there.

1356
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:40,340
Xbox just had 70 games added to its backwards compatibility list.

1357
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:46,860
So it's good to see that sort of dedication to keeping the old up

1358
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,020
with the new so that people can see where their games came from.

1359
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,380
I think it's a great idea.

1360
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,060
When on top of that, we're also dealing with the 20th anniversary of Xbox,

1361
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:03,300
which my baking buddy, Seamus Blackley, has been posting about.

1362
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,260
It's been really neat watching the old pictures

1363
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,940
and seeing the old ads pop up on my Twitter feed.

1364
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:13,540
But yeah, huh?

1365
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:16,620
I was just going to say, good on Phil Spencer for kind of recognizing

1366
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,020
this is an issue in the industry and trying to do something about it.

1367
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,660
Obviously, Microsoft did an about face with its own stance on emulation,

1368
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:27,220
but I think in large part that's due to Phil Spencer coming on board,

1369
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,900
you know, and really driving that.

1370
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,300
So that's a great thing.

1371
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,740
And I bet Phil Spencer would love it

1372
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:37,980
if other platforms might make their way over to Xbox and so forth.

1373
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,060
We'll see, though.

1374
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:43,420
Of course, they had the opportunity with Game Room and decided to let that go.

1375
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,540
But again, that was not under Phil Spencer's call.

1376
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:50,220
So I will back off the attack dogs on that one because I bitch about it every week.

1377
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:54,300
We don't blame him for the idiocy of others.

1378
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,380
No, we don't. We don't. We do not.

1379
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,540
But good. This is a good stance and promising.

1380
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,620
I hope it moves, keeps moving in the right direction.

1381
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,980
I'm happy to hear it.

1382
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,540
There's really a second half to this, which Loki has,

1383
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,660
and that is you kind of brought up the 20 years of Xbox

1384
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:11,340
and there's there's even more, right, Loki?

1385
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,980
Yes. Lots of exciting stuff.

1386
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:16,740
So they had announced

1387
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:21,060
that there's going to be 70 plus classic games that are going to be coming to Xbox.

1388
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,860
Even some more with performance boosts as well.

1389
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:29,500
So lots more backwards compatible games of that.

1390
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,380
I mean, you know, they've got several games from

1391
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,300
pretty much the whole series of Fear is on there.

1392
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:40,260
Dead or Alive, you know, a few games of that beautiful Katamari.

1393
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,380
That's pretty cool.

1394
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,020
Then what else?

1395
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,380
Oh, and Times players, too.

1396
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,780
That's that's an excellent game.

1397
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,980
And then, hey, surprise.

1398
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,860
We're putting out Halo Infinite's multiplayer early.

1399
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,700
You'll have to wait until December eight.

1400
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,260
And apparently it's excellent.

1401
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,700
So that was a pretty cool surprise that they had.

1402
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:06,660
Then along with that, you can now

1403
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,460
with the Xbox one, Xbox Series X and S, you can use Xbox

1404
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,340
Cloud Gaming if you have Game Pass Ultimate as well.

1405
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:15,700
So that's pretty awesome.

1406
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:19,260
You don't have to necessarily do that now to a mobile or smartphone device.

1407
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,580
You can actually use your console,

1408
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:25,460
which I think is the direction that they wanted to go with that stuff.

1409
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,860
And also, it's nice when you want to, say, play a game like,

1410
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,700
I don't know, Flight Simulator or something like that.

1411
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,020
That would normally be a really large download.

1412
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,260
You can just kind of stream it.

1413
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,540
So pretty cool.

1414
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,460
Sorry, my sister is texting me

1415
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,180
as if she doesn't know that I have a show right now.

1416
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,420
That's why I keep looking at my phone.

1417
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:53,700
Sorry, guys. But yes, I thought the Xbox event was pretty cool.

1418
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,700
I love that they have still enhanced the backwards compatibility.

1419
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,180
I know they've pretty much definitively said this time, this is it.

1420
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,220
There's no we're not doing any more work on backwards compatibility.

1421
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,460
This is this is it.

1422
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,340
And that's OK.

1423
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,140
It's fair, obviously. Yeah, it's fair.

1424
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,620
I mean, yes, I'm sure we can all think of games that are still missing DDR.

1425
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,020
It's still like it's still a lot.

1426
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,020
I mean, but yeah, DDR would be cool.

1427
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,860
But Jet Set Radio Future in chat, I see being named, of course.

1428
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,660
So that's a bummer.

1429
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,740
Yeah, but they still got like quite a bit in there,

1430
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,980
and at least they're putting effort into it.

1431
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,020
So, you know, props for that.

1432
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,020
But yeah, I don't know. I get it.

1433
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:42,300
So, yeah, also, I did I didn't mention it during my gaming week,

1434
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,140
but I did lightly check out that shock Halo Infinite drop that they did.

1435
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,820
I did spend the hundred gigs of my bandwidth to download it

1436
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,620
because we've been doing really good on bandwidth this month.

1437
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:56,300
So I downloaded that Halo Infinite preview and I got through the tutorial,

1438
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:01,620
at least now I did not know that there was a PvE or player versus bots mode.

1439
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,180
And Bobby was telling me about that before on his show tonight.

1440
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,700
So I definitely will check that out

1441
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,900
because I'm still a little bit like like that Doom difficulty.

1442
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,780
Mommy, I'm too scared to die when it comes to Halo online right now.

1443
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:19,380
But I think I think the PvE thing Bobby was talking about is good.

1444
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:23,500
That's how I enjoyed playing other games, too, is PvE.

1445
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,860
But also, thankfully, now that I'm super into Dead by Daylight

1446
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:31,820
and all this stuff, it's kind of softened me a little bit on playing with strangers,

1447
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:35,700
even though it also still annoys the shit out of me sometimes like,

1448
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,540
you know, when you're solo queuing and you get in a match against a Freddy

1449
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:43,220
and everybody else decides to die on first hook because it's Freddy like

1450
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,300
annoying. All right.

1451
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,780
Anyway, but I won't I won't talk more about that.

1452
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:54,220
Instead, I will talk about another old company.

1453
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,740
Trying to do new things.

1454
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:00,340
You know what, we give this company a lot of shit, and to be fair,

1455
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,620
I kind of think it's justified most of the time.

1456
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,740
But this sounds kind of interesting.

1457
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,020
And it's Atari we're going to talk about.

1458
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:11,700
Atari is going to be rolling out something called Atari XP.

1459
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:16,340
This is not like an individual gamer product, but it's an initiative

1460
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:20,940
for retro gaming enthusiasts, collectors, where you can get actual Atari

1461
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,900
game cartridges from the 70s and 80s.

1462
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,300
But these are games that didn't really end up happening.

1463
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:31,660
They're either things that probably showed up on a flashback console

1464
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,580
or just straight up never happened.

1465
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,740
I think all of these showed up on a flashback at some point.

1466
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:40,900
But Yars Return, Aquaventure and Saboteur.

1467
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,100
I know I've heard of Saboteur and the Yars one before.

1468
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,940
Those games are going to be the first three that will be through this service.

1469
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,740
They are going to stay focused on Atari.

1470
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,340
Twenty six hundred fifty two hundred seventy eight hundred.

1471
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:56,100
Not like Jaguar and the stuff that came after that stuff.

1472
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,860
No Tempest 3000.

1473
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,940
That would be rad.

1474
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,380
Yeah, I know. Well, who knows if these things sell really well.

1475
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,340
We've had plenty of other temps.

1476
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,220
So anyway, these limited editions are newly manufactured.

1477
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:14,460
These are not old cartridges that were like dug out of landfill or something.

1478
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,620
These are being printed new.

1479
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,540
There will be an instruction manual and other bonus material, a collectible

1480
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,100
pin and a badge, a certificate of authenticity, and you can even get

1481
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,580
a digital copy to play on your Atari VCS like anyone else.

1482
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,140
Come on now. But cute.

1483
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:37,620
They're also saying one thousand nine hundred and eighty three copies of these

1484
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,620
to signify the year they would have been released.

1485
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,860
Now, ready for the Whopper?

1486
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:48,180
These games will go for one hundred and fifty dollars over at Atari XP dot com.

1487
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:53,620
But there will be standard editions cartridge only that are fifty dollars.

1488
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:57,740
They are planning on doing more with Atari XP, including unreleased titles,

1489
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:02,740
rare games, improved versions of classic games with refined

1490
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,380
mechanics and graphics.

1491
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,700
Can you imagine a good E.T.?

1492
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,740
Yes, except they're never going to get the license to do E.T.

1493
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:14,860
again. They can't do that unless somebody wrote a real good contract

1494
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:18,740
in nineteen eighty two or whatever that was, unless someone wrote a real good

1495
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,060
contract. Atari is not going to be able to do another E.T..

1496
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,660
The thing is, is that there's also other companies that have done

1497
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,860
repros of prototypes.

1498
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,740
Yeah. Like, you know, I've got a few of them.

1499
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:33,540
Like I have actually have a baby Pac-Man prototype.

1500
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,620
Tempest, you know, lots of stuff like like that.

1501
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,260
And they sell them for a lot less.

1502
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,940
So I don't know what they what they think.

1503
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:46,100
It said that it is maybe that it is official and licensed.

1504
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,140
I don't know. Interesting.

1505
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,460
Bobby points out that some of these are homebrew.

1506
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:55,500
I thought Saboteur in particular was like just an unreleased Atari game.

1507
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,500
I didn't realize that Yars return or I'm sorry, I already forgot the name

1508
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,660
was was a homebrew thing.

1509
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,620
But Bobby says it came out in 2005.

1510
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,220
They're just selling people's homebrews.

1511
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:10,860
Well, now maybe that's how the homebrews were able to be legitimized a little bit,

1512
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:13,260
I guess. I mean, they were kind of making it on Atari's IP.

1513
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,180
But hey, hopefully both ends are getting coin.

1514
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:17,860
Hopefully the homebrew makers get the coin.

1515
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:21,380
Atari's getting the coin because there's a lot of coin when you charge one hundred

1516
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:25,020
fifty dollars. So that's what's kind of interesting.

1517
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:28,020
So we talk about stealing the other ideas earlier.

1518
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,940
We talked about stream labs and all that.

1519
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,980
Atari is basically doing limited run games.

1520
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:37,620
But I sort of think that's the wheelhouse they should be in.

1521
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:42,620
And whether well, whether you agree this is the right price or not is all this stuff.

1522
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:47,540
I think it's better than that joke of a new console they put out.

1523
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:50,140
Not that long ago, although the hotel thing does sound rad.

1524
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,500
That's not what I'm making that sound about.

1525
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:59,860
It's that they're they're not really imitating limited run because.

1526
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,660
Limited run doesn't have the monopoly on doing that either.

1527
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,260
And they didn't copy the they didn't copy the website as far as we know.

1528
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:14,380
But I mean, a limited run of a game is just that limited printing of a game and

1529
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,740
companies have been doing that forever.

1530
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:19,580
So I don't know if that's the best comparison that I would have made.

1531
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:23,740
Well, that's fair. The reason why I bring it up is because the limited run games has

1532
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:26,060
had such success with it.

1533
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:31,340
And I think I think it showed somebody at Atari, whoever's calling the shots there,

1534
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:36,700
this could work because it's working over here for these guys and their NES replicas

1535
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,140
of Mayman 2 and all this stuff.

1536
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:43,580
So that's why I put it that way, is that, you know, yeah, yeah.

1537
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:48,580
So anyway, Bobby also humble bragging a little bit, saying I bought Saboteur from

1538
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:52,900
Howard Scott Warshaw directly and it's signed back in 2004.

1539
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,020
Can we just give it up here for Howard Scott Warshaw right now?

1540
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,700
He was a true genius of the 80s Atari games.

1541
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:03,060
He is. And of course, I'm sure a lot of you guys remember the old commercials on that

1542
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,780
network where he used to brag.

1543
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,700
He made one of the best Atari 2600 games ever made.

1544
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,420
Yars revenge and one of the worst E.T.

1545
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,780
But you all know the documentaries are out there.

1546
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:18,980
What Howard Scott Warshaw was given six weeks and a bag of cocaine, allegedly, to make

1547
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,180
E.T. happen. And you got what you got.

1548
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,500
You talk. Oh, my God.

1549
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:30,180
The broke ass game to make the holiday season is been a recurring theme in this

1550
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:34,620
industry since literally eighty two, eighty three, whatever that E.T.

1551
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,780
game came out. And here we are.

1552
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:42,220
Twenty twenty one and take two still hasn't figured it out.

1553
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:49,740
Orange right says E.T., if it wasn't crunched, I mean, but back in the day, it really was

1554
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:52,020
one person that made a lot of those games.

1555
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,940
It really was. Bonds 006 says, but he did it.

1556
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,620
And that's why in many ways, E.T.

1557
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,580
is actually kind of awesome.

1558
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:00,940
Yes, I said it.

1559
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:06,300
E.T. is actually kind of awesome because he threw that together in six weeks.

1560
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,740
What have you done with the last six weeks?

1561
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:15,700
I know I don't have a great answer for that, so I just I just think that's a great story

1562
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:16,780
with that for what it is.

1563
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:22,860
So, all right. I think a great segue into our next segment.

1564
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:23,980
So let me roll the bump.

1565
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:41,980
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out

1566
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,700
a classic and tell you about it.

1567
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1568
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:52,660
And dark soccer is going to tell you the game, and I'm going to warn you, I'm having to do this

1569
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,100
a little differently tonight.

1570
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:54,940
Apologies.

1571
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:59,460
I neglected to rip the B roll in advance because I had a little bit of a busy Sunday.

1572
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,300
But I think we got it.

1573
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,300
So dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1574
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:10,220
The classic game of the week is Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which I played the shit out of.

1575
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:13,260
I even remember

1576
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:19,780
Tiara visiting once and us playing through this game and having such a great time with it.

1577
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:30,100
But anyway, it's by the company that acquired another company that's currently having some

1578
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,260
problems right now, and I didn't realize it when I picked it.

1579
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:41,500
But it came out in 2006, it was an action role-playing game developed by Raven Software

1580
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:46,900
for PS2, PS3, Xbox and Xbox 360, published by They Who Shall Not Be Named.

1581
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,780
It did have a port to PSP and Wii by Vicarious Visions, and then to Windows by Benox.

1582
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:00,980
There is a sort of Game Boy Advance version by Barking Lizards, and a remastered version

1583
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:09,260
developed by Zoe Mode for Windows, PS4, Xbox One that came out 10 years later in 2016.

1584
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:19,140
So it is set in its own, I guess, part of the Marvel multiverse, where you have different

1585
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,380
heroes, different villains, different supporting characters.

1586
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:28,020
And it's very similar to X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2 Rise of Apocalypse that you

1587
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:35,060
have, you choose your different team from the roster there and different story objectives

1588
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:35,580
that you go.

1589
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:42,060
For this particular one, you have to defeat Doctor Doom and the Masters of Evil.

1590
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,420
It was a really good game.

1591
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,940
I mean, it was really fun.

1592
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:53,900
You had, like, just the best banter that went in in the game.

1593
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,660
It was so much fun.

1594
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:02,060
I mean, I felt, you know, Ultimate Alliance 2 was really good.

1595
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:08,140
Ultimate Alliance 3 was kind of, even though it was done by Team Ninja, but we won't talk

1596
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:08,660
about that yet.

1597
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:16,340
Maybe in 2029, because that'll be 10 years after that.

1598
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:24,820
Anyway, you start from a cast of over 22 playable characters, although some of them are

1599
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,140
not available when you start, you have to unlock them.

1600
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:36,540
You also get bonuses if you form certain groups, like putting Avengers together, Defenders,

1601
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:45,140
Fantastic Four, X-Men, Marvel Knights, you know, and then you have to do these different

1602
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:46,420
missions as you keep going.

1603
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:50,140
And you can switch between your characters.

1604
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,420
They've got special moves.

1605
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,620
You've got different things going.

1606
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,620
It's very much a masher game, though.

1607
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:55,980
I will be perfectly honest.

1608
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:03,940
There's also some differences in some of the other versions.

1609
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:12,340
For Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Marketplace, you had a Heroes pack that gave you a few other

1610
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:18,940
Marvel characters and you had a Villains pack, you know, and they came with different achievements.

1611
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,140
The Gold Edition has all of that in there.

1612
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:25,340
Of course, you know, if the game is successful, they're going to do 50 million different versions

1613
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:25,740
of the game.

1614
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:34,340
The Wii version has motion specific controls and they also have different missions and

1615
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:38,340
added in a couple other characters, as did the PC version.

1616
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:43,340
It has intuitive mouse controls, but it also will work with the game pad.

1617
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:48,340
And then, of course, the Game Boy Advance version is just the sort of teeny version of it.

1618
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,340
The game is beautiful.

1619
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:54,340
You are traveling all through the Marvel universe.

1620
01:35:54,940 --> 01:36:01,940
You go to Asgard, you go to space, you hang out with Galactus for a hot minute.

1621
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,940
It's pretty, pretty awesome.

1622
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,940
You've got so many different bosses in the game.

1623
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:16,940
I like to pride myself on my comic book knowledge, although I will say that most of my knowledge

1624
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:21,940
has to basically stay in the X-Men universe, but there's some pretty, pretty cool stuff.

1625
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:25,540
And there's other characters that are just in cut scenes that's still a really good nod to.

1626
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,540
It got really positive reviews.

1627
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:39,540
For Metacritic, the initial console releases were over 80%.

1628
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:43,540
Reviewers and magazines gave it really good reviews.

1629
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,540
And like I said, there's been sequels.

1630
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,540
There was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

1631
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:54,140
That was also pretty fun, but it was the stupid Civil War storyline,

1632
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:58,140
which I hated the Civil War storyline from the comics, I won't go there.

1633
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:02,140
And then there was Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 The Black Order.

1634
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:07,140
That was done by Team Ninja, and it's a reboot of the series,

1635
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:12,140
so it's a different continuity from the first game, but it has kind of similar lines.

1636
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:18,740
To this day, it's still a very solid, easy-to-play game.

1637
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:21,740
It's got great story to it.

1638
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
It really is a lot of fun.

1639
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:31,740
I kind of want to hook up my Xbox again and play it,

1640
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,740
just because I've had it kind of on my mind for a little bit.

1641
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:40,740
It's really good, and I recommend if you haven't played it, why the fuck not?

1642
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,740
Especially playing as Deadpool.

1643
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,740
Sounds like there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

1644
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:55,740
Very loved choice by chat, it sounds like.

1645
01:37:55,740 --> 01:38:02,740
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, you have to remember the game came out after the last two games that were X-Men Legends 1 and 2.

1646
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:04,740
That's what I said.

1647
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,740
Questbuster says, replayability was great.

1648
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:10,740
There was loot, unlockable characters, and a skill system to keep you coming back.

1649
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,340
S.J. 100 Matt says, I got it on PS2 in storage somewhere.

1650
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:19,340
S.J. 100 Matt also says, very button-mashy, but so much fun.

1651
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:23,340
Oh yeah, this was a stress relief game for me. I had a lot of fun.

1652
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:31,340
And yes, I did mention right at the beginning that it was based off of the same for X-Men Legends and X-Men Legends 2.

1653
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:33,340
Ah, gotcha.

1654
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,340
I may have snuck in a potty bit.

1655
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:41,940
Alright, awesome, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1656
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:48,940
So, let's get back into talking about some news, and we'll go now to rapid fire news.

1657
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,940
Loki, why don't you start us off?

1658
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:56,940
Yeah, so we got news, and I'm not surprised because of all the backlash it received, but

1659
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:01,940
Saints Row has been delayed now to August of 2022.

1660
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:07,540
And it's, you know, basically to give them more development time, which I'm totally cool with.

1661
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:13,540
Let's let them take the time and make it good, and maybe come up with some different characters that they have in the game.

1662
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:15,540
That's a tall order.

1663
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,540
I'll give it a chance, I'll give it a chance. Actually, the gameplay looked pretty good.

1664
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:27,540
Still not sold on the characters yet, but if they have good writing and a good story behind them, maybe I'll come around.

1665
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,540
No promises.

1666
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:31,140
No promises, yeah.

1667
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:42,140
Something that's actually very insanely cool is this brand new Disney World DLC pack that's available for Minecraft Bedrock.

1668
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:48,140
And what it adds is Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom, and it's a full park.

1669
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:54,140
You can actually have all of the cast members sign a book, you have an autograph book that you can go through and stuff.

1670
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:58,140
And all of the rides are interactable.

1671
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:03,740
You can actually ride all the rides, and it's extremely detailed with the copyright music and everything.

1672
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:11,740
They even went so far, if you were to stream it, to have a content creator mode in it that will suppress the copyrighted music.

1673
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:16,740
I checked out some video of it, it looks absolutely amazing.

1674
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:24,740
It's just really realistic, like someone was playing the Buzz Lightyear ride, and you can actually shoot the targets and everything like that.

1675
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,740
Which is pretty awesome.

1676
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,340
Do you have a reason to play Minecraft again?

1677
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:31,340
I think so, I want to check this out.

1678
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,340
Autotopia.

1679
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,340
Yeah, all the rides are in there.

1680
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:41,340
I actually was going to get this for my kid, but I probably will have to try it out myself too.

1681
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,340
It looks pretty cool.

1682
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,340
Oh my gosh, Space Mountain.

1683
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:47,340
Yeah, Space Mountain is in it.

1684
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,340
This is definitely the Disney World stuff.

1685
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:51,340
Wow, I want to check it out.

1686
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:53,340
Can I get it on Xbox with that version?

1687
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,340
Yes, that version is the one.

1688
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,940
The DLC.

1689
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,940
That's pretty neat, I might have to check that out.

1690
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:01,940
That's really clever and cool.

1691
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,940
This looks pretty neat.

1692
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,940
The detail in it is amazing.

1693
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:14,940
It's still Minecraft blocks, but they have an insane amount of custom items and obviously some customized stuff that they've coded into it.

1694
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,940
They have the fireworks show that you can do as well.

1695
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,940
Lots of cool stuff.

1696
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:21,940
I saw some Grim Grinning Ghosts.

1697
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,940
Yes, yes.

1698
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:28,540
And they even have the barbershop quartet.

1699
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,540
The Dapper Dans.

1700
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,540
The Dapper Dans, they're in there.

1701
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,540
That's fun.

1702
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,540
Damn it, Disney.

1703
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,540
Alright.

1704
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:43,540
Dar Sakra, sorry to pull you away from that YouTube, but I know you have some headlines for us too.

1705
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:45,540
Yes.

1706
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:53,140
So, there is an update for Mario Kart Live, even though not everyone has been super into it.

1707
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,140
Alright, great.

1708
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:59,140
Mario Kart live in a box, because that's where my Mario Kart Live is.

1709
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:02,140
Well, it's being referred to as version 2.0.

1710
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:15,140
It has a split screen mode, so you can have two karts on one switch, a relay race, you have the Luigi Cup, three new courses, which is King Boo's Courtyard, Music Broadway, and Windmill Meadows.

1711
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:21,740
And an unlockable cart that you get if you place in all of the new courses.

1712
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:24,740
It's called Luigi's Poltergust.

1713
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:27,740
And there you go.

1714
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:30,740
If you're into it, maybe it's a reason to play again.

1715
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:32,740
There you go.

1716
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,740
And then I have to tell this site that I don't want cookies.

1717
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,740
I mean, I want real cookies, but whatever.

1718
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:46,340
So Sega has clarified their stance on the Microsoft thing.

1719
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:52,340
Basically, the details are, I'm just going to go ahead and read this verbatim.

1720
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:55,340
We already have a close business relationship with Microsoft.

1721
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:06,340
We outsource the development of their large-scale titles, and as a third party, we are supplying a variety of titles, referring to their work on Halo Wars 2 and Age of Empires 4.

1722
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:17,940
So they're not talking about exclusivity, but to do a super game initiative, something that they're going to be working on together.

1723
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,940
Very curious to see what comes of that, that's for sure.

1724
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,940
All right.

1725
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,940
Let's travel around the world and check out releases for this week.

1726
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:34,940
I'm not sure we have a lot, a lot, because the games that want to be sold on Black Friday should be out by now.

1727
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:40,540
I guess we did have a couple of games that released last year on Black Friday, but let's check in with...

1728
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,540
Does it exist in Japan?

1729
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:43,540
Yeah, that's true.

1730
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:44,540
We got the rest of the world too.

1731
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:46,540
So, Loki, what's coming out this week?

1732
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:50,540
So, this week we've got not a whole ton.

1733
01:43:50,540 --> 01:44:01,540
We have RE Legend, which is going to be on PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One.

1734
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:07,140
Death's Door, which is on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1735
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:08,140
That's it.

1736
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,140
All right.

1737
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:11,140
As DarkSakura alluded to, much different story in Japan.

1738
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,140
We have a lot of releases actually this week on the Switch.

1739
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:19,140
Ironically, Dead by Daylight, getting a fifth anniversary edition on the Nintendo Switch.

1740
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:24,140
And that is, they labeled it as in English, but it is a Japanese localized release.

1741
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,140
Kukiomi 123, also out in Japan this week on the Switch.

1742
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:32,740
We have Deer Simulator, your average everyday deer game.

1743
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,740
I like that it's got an honest title.

1744
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:35,740
I kind of want to play that.

1745
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:36,740
It's a goat stimulator.

1746
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:38,740
It's really stupid.

1747
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,740
I like stupid.

1748
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:41,740
It's pretty stupid.

1749
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:43,740
Well, that's out in Japan this week.

1750
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:47,740
We have Eastward, also coming out in Japan this week, all on the 25th.

1751
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:50,740
Asatsugatori is also out this week.

1752
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:53,740
And we have some other games in regular and limited edition.

1753
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:57,740
One releases Parfait Remake, and the other releases Fuyukiss.

1754
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:01,340
Those are just the Nintendo Switch titles for this week.

1755
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,340
Taking a look at PlayStation 5.

1756
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:08,340
Farming Simulator 22 gets its Japanese release this week, as well as Disciples Liberation.

1757
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:12,340
Treasures of the Agian, again, Dead by Daylight.

1758
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,340
Aegean?

1759
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,340
Yes, that's it.

1760
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,340
Like the Aegean Sea?

1761
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:20,340
Dead by Daylight also getting its Japanese release, or I think it's like a different bundle basically.

1762
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:24,340
I think it's been out in Japan, but the fifth anniversary edition is out this week.

1763
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:30,940
And then Cricket 22, the official game of the Ashes, also out in Japan this week.

1764
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:36,940
And quickly glancing at the PlayStation 4 to see if there's anything that wasn't already covered on the Switch.

1765
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:43,940
I think mostly it's the same stuff, but you do have, oh okay, you get a price reduction on Need for Speed Heat.

1766
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:50,940
And then the whole, looks like Biohazard 25th, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, those different episodes.

1767
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:57,540
Those are, I think they're a price reduction as well, happening on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1768
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,540
Dead by Daylight also on PS4 if you care.

1769
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:06,540
Well, sometimes Jamie gets really bored early in the morning and watches Japanese streamers playing Dead by Daylight.

1770
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:08,540
Oh, fun!

1771
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:18,540
And sometimes they'll say, oh, you know, they'll actually talk to English viewers, so I think it's pretty fun.

1772
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:23,140
Oh, that's neat. Well, they have a new retail release for whatever reason.

1773
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:29,140
I imagine it probably just bundles in some of the DLC and, you know, trying to draw new people into the game, so that is available.

1774
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:34,140
Yep. All right, so for Europe then, right?

1775
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:35,140
Yep.

1776
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:38,140
Okay, just making sure you got everything because they're pretty big.

1777
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:44,140
Well, it's already out now, but Farming Simulator 22 came out today.

1778
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:49,740
And then for the 23rd, we have Let's Sing 2022 on Switch.

1779
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:58,740
On the 25th, we have Cricket 22, the official games of the Ashes for PlayStation and Xbox.

1780
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:01,740
We have Asterix and Obelix, slap them all.

1781
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:02,740
Funny comics.

1782
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:07,740
So we have that on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

1783
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:13,340
And then on the 26th, we have Windlands 2 for PlayStation.

1784
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,340
That's it.

1785
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,340
All right, that's it.

1786
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:26,340
We still have some more headlines for you guys and then, of course, we'll get to that part of the show where you can call in or email or any of that stuff.

1787
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,340
We'll get to that in just a little bit, but first, Loki with another headline.

1788
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:32,340
Yeah, so this is kind of cool.

1789
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,940
This is something that was more of a rumor in leaks.

1790
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:41,940
We talked about like the fighting game that had like Shaggy and Superman and whatnot, but apparently it's actually a real thing.

1791
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:44,940
So it's going to be a free to play game that Warner games is putting out.

1792
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:52,940
And it's basically like a Smash Brothers game, but it has all sorts of different characters in it from different Warner Brothers properties.

1793
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:58,940
So right now, the roster that they showed off, they've got Aria Stark from Game of Thrones.

1794
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:10,540
We have Batman, Superman, Bugs Bunny, Finn the Human, Jake Dogg, Harley Quinn, Shaggy, Tom and Jerry, Wonder Woman.

1795
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:17,540
And then they've got a new character that they created called Rain Dog and Garnet, who I have no idea what show she is from.

1796
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:20,540
That would probably be Steven Universe, right?

1797
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,540
It may be Steven Universe.

1798
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:24,540
Yeah, I'm not familiar with Steven Universe.

1799
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:35,140
This actually seems to be a little bit better than, say, the Nintendo one that just came out recently was you may remember that none of their characters were voice acted.

1800
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:40,140
Whereas in this one, all of the characters are voice acted and by the people that actually...

1801
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,140
Did you mean Nickelodeon, not Nintendo?

1802
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,140
Yeah, the Nickelodeon one.

1803
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:44,140
Yeah, sorry.

1804
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:45,140
Not Nintendo.

1805
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,140
The Nickelodeon one is what I was talking about.

1806
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:53,140
So they have like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.

1807
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:59,740
And of course, Maisie Williams reprising Aria and John DiMaggio as Jake the Dogg and stuff.

1808
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:04,740
So very huge cast of voice actors in that.

1809
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:11,740
It's supposed to be coming out later, I guess, next year and on all the consoles and PC and stuff.

1810
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:16,740
Many folks in chat referencing how this game appears to be very meme-ified.

1811
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:19,740
It kind of seems to exist for the memes.

1812
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:23,340
Not only do you have Matthew Lillard doing Shaggy, which is something the internet is,

1813
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:27,340
you know, memed all over the place, Pod Culture points out...

1814
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,340
Casey Kasem is clearly dead.

1815
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:33,840
Pod Culture points out Shaggy has a Smoke Em Out move, which is obviously a wink and

1816
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,340
a nod to what we all know Shaggy is doing.

1817
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,340
And he can also Super Saiyan or whatever.

1818
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,340
So it's like the Super Shaggy thing.

1819
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:41,340
Yeah.

1820
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:43,340
Does he have to eat a Scooby snack for it?

1821
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:44,340
Yeah.

1822
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,740
Bonds 006 in chat says, to think, someone at WB actually went to their boss with this

1823
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:50,740
idea and he approved it.

1824
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:55,740
Well, you know what, we've had enough stories about idiot executives tonight.

1825
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:57,740
It's time to recognize a good one.

1826
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:00,740
So congrats that guy at WB who gave us the green light.

1827
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:02,740
It could be a lady, Rob.

1828
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,740
You're right.

1829
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:06,740
Let's not give them credit for coming up with this idea.

1830
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:08,740
It's not a unique idea.

1831
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:11,740
Let's look at the history here.

1832
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:17,740
So we have Ready Player One that they tried this with already with shoehorning as many

1833
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,740
things as possible in there.

1834
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:25,740
Then Space Jam 2 or Ready Player One Part Two, where they tried shoehorning as many

1835
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,740
Warner Brothers properties as possible.

1836
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:31,740
Thankfully though, on the game side, it seemed to work out a little bit better because, you

1837
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:34,740
know, we've got Lego Dimensions, which is fantastic.

1838
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:39,740
So I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

1839
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:43,740
Maybe can we get some like other properties like, you know, Lego Dimensions in this as

1840
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:44,740
well?

1841
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:45,740
I mean,

1842
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:51,740
Because maybe we get Chell from, you know, portal fighting in here as well.

1843
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,740
No, no, no.

1844
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,740
We need Space Ghost.

1845
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,740
Space Ghost needs to be in it.

1846
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:59,740
Space Ghost is a superhero.

1847
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,740
I'm sure there's plenty more lists to come.

1848
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:02,740
This is not going to be the end of it.

1849
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,740
I'm yes.

1850
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,740
It's a small roster.

1851
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:08,740
And they've already said that they're planning on adding more characters as they go along.

1852
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:10,740
And they have also different like skins and whatnot.

1853
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,740
Obviously, free to play game.

1854
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,740
So you're going to, you know, buy stuff.

1855
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,740
What if they added in like Grape Ape?

1856
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:19,740
There's a lot of things they could add in this.

1857
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,740
That would be though hilarious.

1858
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,740
Like this big giant character.

1859
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,740
That would be awesome.

1860
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:26,740
All right.

1861
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,740
Moving on.

1862
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,740
Let's talk about.

1863
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,740
I'm a fan of the obscure.

1864
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:31,740
Moving on.

1865
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:34,740
Let's talk about maybe this game will get nominated at next year's The Game Awards.

1866
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,740
I doubt it, but it might.

1867
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:39,740
But we know the nominees for this year's The Game Awards.

1868
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:42,740
This kind of snuck up on us, but it is around that time of year.

1869
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:44,740
Usually Thanksgiving weeks away.

1870
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,740
Yeah.

1871
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,740
It all moves so fast.

1872
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:55,740
Like we find out the nominees this week and then the ceremony is just in a couple of weeks, which it sounds like, by the way, I can't go because they didn't open the tickets to the public this year.

1873
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:56,740
So that's kind of a bummer.

1874
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:00,740
But honestly, after reading the games that got nominated.

1875
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:04,740
There's a very obvious oversight in here, in my humble opinion.

1876
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:09,740
However, the nominees for Game of the Year are Deathloop.

1877
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:10,740
Doesn't surprise me.

1878
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:20,740
A lot of people talking about kind of the story I haven't played yet, but a lot of people talking about the story of that game and how it's kind of pretty innovative, what it does with some of the time stuff and making that a mechanic.

1879
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:23,740
It Takes Two was nominated.

1880
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,740
Metroid Dread is nominated.

1881
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,740
So there's your Nintendo pick in the back.

1882
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:29,740
There's always a Nintendo one in the back.

1883
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:32,740
Psychonauts 2 got a nomination as well.

1884
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:35,740
So that is the representative from the Xbox area.

1885
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:39,740
Ratchet and Clank, Rift Apart, also nominated for Game of the Year.

1886
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:43,740
And Resident Evil Village, nominated for Game of the Year as well.

1887
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:46,740
So those are your nominees for Game of the Year.

1888
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,740
Nowhere to be seen.

1889
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:52,740
The game that has been getting tens, tens, tens across the board from all the critics.

1890
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:54,740
Forza Horizon 5.

1891
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:56,740
Um, all right.

1892
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,740
I guess somebody thought...

1893
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:01,740
The Game of War is more like fiscal year?

1894
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:04,740
No, no, it is, it is, uh, it is calendar year.

1895
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,740
It is allowed to be included if it was released before like November.

1896
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:12,740
Basically all the games released before Black Friday are eligible in a nutshell.

1897
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:15,740
So yes, even though it was just a moment ago, it's kind of like the Oscar movies.

1898
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:19,740
As long as it plays in a theater in LA, in a theater in New York before the end of the year, it's eligible.

1899
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:22,740
So, um, Forza should have been eligible.

1900
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:28,740
Um, but I understand that some folks might find it a little bit reductive from part four

1901
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:33,740
because, you know, it's more of the same even if it is really, really good what it is doing.

1902
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:38,740
Um, I still think at some point you have to acknowledge what the series is doing.

1903
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:42,740
I'm sort of reminded of the Oscars when they finally recognized Return of the King

1904
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:45,740
as best picture of the year because the trilogy was over at that point.

1905
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:51,740
So I worry the Horizon series is not going to get its due until Playground Games comes out and says,

1906
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:54,740
this is the last one, which I don't want to ever see that happen to be quite honest.

1907
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:59,740
So, um, anyway, that's my piece on that. I said what I said.

1908
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:02,740
Uh, this is an interesting layout of games.

1909
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:07,740
And what's interesting about it, it's kind of hard for me to say X is the front runner.

1910
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:12,740
I've heard a lot of buzz about all of these games in one way or another.

1911
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,740
I'm not sure there is a front runner.

1912
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:21,740
I would guess Metroid Dread, but that might be a little bit of personal kind of coming into it.

1913
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:25,740
Um, Deathloop, I've also heard a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff about.

1914
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:29,740
Um, so, yeah, let's see.

1915
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:35,740
Now, some folks in chat mentioning Mike Deft says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated for other awards.

1916
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:38,740
And Bobby Lockl says Forza Horizon 5 is nominated in three other categories.

1917
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:43,740
Yes, yes, we love nominations in the technical categories for a pity award.

1918
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:46,740
Same thing happens with the movie awards, right?

1919
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:50,740
You get this great movie and then it's like, oh, it got nominated for costume design.

1920
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:51,740
How cute.

1921
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:54,740
Um, not that costume design is important.

1922
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:55,740
I'm just saying.

1923
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:57,740
Uh, let's see.

1924
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:01,740
Mike Deft says I think Returnal is missing from that game of the year list.

1925
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:04,740
Not the first person I've heard say that.

1926
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:05,740
That's for sure.

1927
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:12,740
I've seen a lot of that on social media is that people think because of the bugs that existed in Returnal at the very beginning,

1928
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:17,740
it's kind of getting the shaft here, um, which, you know, is a problem all in itself.

1929
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:19,740
So that's somewhat interesting.

1930
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,740
Let me see.

1931
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,740
There's a lot of categories, you guys.

1932
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:27,740
I don't want to read them all, but let me see if there's another category I want to do here.

1933
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:32,740
I want to talk about performance.

1934
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:33,740
Where is it?

1935
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:38,740
There's like voice performance.

1936
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:39,740
Hold on, I'm looking for a guy.

1937
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:41,740
Sorry, I know this is terrible radio.

1938
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:42,740
There it is.

1939
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:43,740
Interesting.

1940
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:50,740
I don't know if it ever was split into actor and actress type of thing, but just a note.

1941
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,740
Now it is just best performance.

1942
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:57,740
I know I've seen another award show in gaming that was split, so I just think that's interesting.

1943
01:55:57,740 --> 01:56:00,740
The nominees in that category.

1944
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:05,740
Erica Mori, nominated as Alex in Life is Strange True Colors.

1945
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:10,740
Giancarlo Esposito, nominated for Anton Castillo in Far Cry 6.

1946
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:14,740
Jason Kelly, nominated as Colt Vaughn in Deathloop.

1947
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:19,740
Maggie Robertson, nominated as Lady Dimitrescu for Resident Evil Village.

1948
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:25,740
And Ozioma, I hope I said that right, Akaga as Juliana Blake in Deathloop as well.

1949
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:29,740
There is a very clear front runner there in my opinion, but then again, I haven't played Deathloop.

1950
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:37,740
So maybe, but in my opinion, that Lady Dimitrescu kind of like own that game, but she wasn't in it very long.

1951
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:38,740
Spoiler alert.

1952
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,740
So I don't know.

1953
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:42,740
So I don't know.

1954
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:44,740
Wasn't that Resident Evil and not Deathloop?

1955
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,740
No, no. Yes.

1956
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:48,740
Yes. Lady Dimitrescu was in Resident Evil, but not for very long.

1957
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:54,740
Still, because I thought you were saying it in the context of Deathloop and I'm like, what?

1958
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:55,740
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1959
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:56,740
Sorry.

1960
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:57,740
So, yeah, hold on.

1961
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:59,740
I'm looking to see if there's any comments there.

1962
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:03,740
Mike Deaf does say Deathloop has really good voice acting.

1963
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:05,740
Yeah, there you go.

1964
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:11,740
Garth the Wolf in Chat says doing Hades Extreme while listening to the show LMAO Loot Dragon Time.

1965
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:13,740
Hey, that's last year's Game of the Year right there.

1966
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:14,740
Or at least it was nominated.

1967
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:18,740
It didn't actually win, but I know it got nominated.

1968
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:21,740
Yeah, Mike Deaf says Lady Dimitrescu is the people's vote.

1969
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:24,740
Yeah, Tigerclaw says Giancarlo Esposito is a good actor.

1970
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:25,740
He could win it.

1971
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:27,740
It's a good group, if nothing else.

1972
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,740
So there is that.

1973
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:32,740
So, yeah, I think that's all I'll read.

1974
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:35,740
If you want to see more of the nominees, you can head on over to the Game Award websites.

1975
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:42,740
Of course, you can vote, but if you read the fine print, audience voting is only 10% of the vote.

1976
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:45,740
That way you guys can't fuck it up.

1977
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:49,740
The critics and the board still have 90% of the say.

1978
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:54,740
I haven't checked the fine print this year to see if maybe those numbers shifted, so disclaimer,

1979
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,740
but I know in previous years the people's vote is only 10% of the vote.

1980
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:01,740
So just an interesting little footnote you may have missed.

1981
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,740
All right, we have a few more stories for you guys.

1982
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:06,740
Let's go to Dark Sakura with our next story.

1983
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:17,740
So, well, people like BTS, and BTS has been doing several collaborations across the board with other things.

1984
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:26,740
So they're actually going to be working with doing a collaboration with Among Us.

1985
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:33,740
They're going to have the BT21 characters that were created by line friends

1986
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:40,740
to do all animated versions of the members of BTS for Among Us.

1987
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:42,740
So there you go.

1988
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:47,740
I don't listen to BTS. A lot of people do.

1989
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:56,740
I've listened to a few things, but I mean, I think it's kind of cool that there's this big international thing going on,

1990
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:58,740
that they've hit it so big.

1991
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:01,740
They're involved in games that a lot of people around the world are going to be playing.

1992
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:04,740
So there you go.

1993
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:06,740
I'll be interested to see.

1994
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:09,740
It would be a nice kick in the pants for Among Us, too.

1995
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:12,740
I know there's still people playing it, but I do kind of feel like that game sort of peaked,

1996
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:15,740
at least as far as like the Twitch interactivity and stuff, a while ago.

1997
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:19,740
Yes, I know people are still playing it, but not as many as were.

1998
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:25,740
But this could be the nice little like kick in the pants that that game could kind of use to get people to play it again.

1999
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,740
So we'll see.

2000
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:30,740
I think it's more that people outside of the US are playing it more.

2001
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,740
Oh, good point. Fair point.

2002
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:34,740
You're not the only country in the world.

2003
01:59:34,740 --> 01:59:35,740
That's true.

2004
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:39,740
Jason and chat are voiceover dudes saying Among Us collab, not Fortnite.

2005
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:40,740
Bless.

2006
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,740
Hey, you know what, though?

2007
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:45,740
I have to say, remember the Ariana Grande Fortnite collab was actually pretty cool.

2008
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:50,740
Like in that day, take that for somebody who does not play Fortnite, but kind of wanted to for that.

2009
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:56,740
Garth, the wolf in chat says BTS came out with the best sauces McDonald's has had for their nuggies in years.

2010
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:57,740
Honestly, truth.

2011
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:02,740
Like I know BTS from the McDonald's meal and those sauces were really good.

2012
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:06,740
So there is they have I'm unfamiliar with.

2013
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:11,740
I think they exist in other again, like dark soccer kind of pointed out other other parts of the world.

2014
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:14,740
And I think they just made them for the US for a short time.

2015
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:19,740
I want to say there was a spicy chili sauce and some type of mustard sauce.

2016
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:23,740
Garth, the wolf. Correct me if I'm wrong. It was it was as like a spicy mustard as well.

2017
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:26,740
Maybe it was a chili sauce and spicy mustard, but they were really good.

2018
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:31,740
Oh, thank you. Garth, the wolf says Cajun and sweet chili were the two sauces.

2019
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:37,740
OK, they were good. Who had the mustard? Somebody, another artist had the mustard then.

2020
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:42,740
Was that Saweetie? I don't know. All right. Anyway, moving on.

2021
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:46,740
Let's get to Loki's story.

2022
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:54,740
So this is out of like left field here, but apparently there was a video put up or a brand new site, I should say,

2023
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:59,740
called Beyond the Groovy that's been put up by Interplay Entertainment.

2024
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:05,740
And it is kind of showing off Earthworm Jim as an animated series.

2025
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:08,740
I don't know if these are like animation tests or what,

2026
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:15,740
but apparently there's an animated series for Earthworm Jim coming out. Wasn't there already?

2027
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:21,740
Yeah, there was a cartoon in the past. This is going to be like a computer animated thing.

2028
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:26,740
It looks all right. I mean, I like I like the old cartoon,

2029
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:32,740
so sure. Why not? Beats what Earthworm Jim 4 looks like.

2030
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:38,740
It's an interesting development as far as Intellivision having that property right now.

2031
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:42,740
I don't put too much stock in that, but it's interesting.

2032
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:47,740
That's it. Like interesting can go a lot of ways. I just think it's interesting.

2033
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:54,740
Yeah. So. All right. Last. No one asked for this, but sure.

2034
02:01:54,740 --> 02:02:02,740
Last but not least, I thought this was a very interesting story with the former VP of marketing for Nintendo of America.

2035
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:07,740
You know, the GameCube is 20 years old now. It originally came out in 2001 for the holidays.

2036
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:14,740
And here we are. Holidays 2021. VGC had an interview with Perrin Kaplan,

2037
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:20,740
who you might remember from some of the older E3s who at the time was VP of marketing at Nintendo America.

2038
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:31,740
And in the interview, Perrin Kaplan mentioned that the PR marketing teams at Nintendo of America were not happy with the purple color choice for the GameCube.

2039
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:37,740
And that these teams informed Nintendo Japan of this. But Nintendo Japan has the final say.

2040
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:42,740
And so that was it. Nintendo America was told, nope, this is the direction we're going in.

2041
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:45,740
Nintendo of America wanted to do black and silver at launch,

2042
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:49,740
which is funny because those colors came later, if I'm not mistaken, because I had a silver one.

2043
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:53,740
Thanks to Loki. Loki bought me a GameCube. Wasn't it a silver one? I think it was.

2044
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:59,740
So I liked purple. Yeah, I like the color. We never got over here with spice.

2045
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:05,740
Yeah. Yeah. But what's interesting now, here's the.

2046
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:14,740
Nintendo of America thought the purple GameCube looked too feminine and they were nervous that it would be slated at E3 based on the color.

2047
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:22,740
And here's the quote from Perrin Kaplan, who, if I'm not mistaken, is it wasn't Perrin Kaplan a one or is a woman?

2048
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:28,740
I think so. What I remember. We actually suggested that the purple was not the best to start with.

2049
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:35,740
And Japan said, no, we're going to use that. Then we pushed for black and silver because I think in the US, nobody had ever really done the purple color before.

2050
02:03:35,740 --> 02:03:40,740
It wasn't that you couldn't bring out hardware that was a different color. It was just a very female looking color.

2051
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:50,740
It just didn't feel masculine, I think. I remember us being very nervous at E3 that we were going to get bad press of purple based on the color.

2052
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:59,740
Beth Lujan, who is the former director of corporate communications, says this predates Apple picking your color these days is like making a statement.

2053
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:03,740
But back then, all the game systems were black. Even white hadn't really been done widely.

2054
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:10,740
Nintendo was never a technology story, but we were always combating what our competitors at Sony and Microsoft were doing from a PR perspective.

2055
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:20,740
And having this purple box didn't quite help there. Beth, wasn't the Super Nintendo a white and purple console?

2056
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:28,740
Am I am I recalling that incorrectly? Wasn't the Nintendo Entertainment System agree?

2057
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:35,740
All right. It was it was just two different shades of gray overseas.

2058
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:43,740
And I think that this might be, I hate to say it, but a coded phrase.

2059
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:55,740
And I'm going to just call it out there. I mean, I kind of think that there is a big stink of maybe some homophobia behind behind this comment.

2060
02:04:55,740 --> 02:04:57,740
Interesting.

2061
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,740
Because I mean.

2062
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:11,740
There was like, well, what was it that I was reading that that things that are purple are coded to be more toward the LGBT community in marketing?

2063
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:14,740
I've heard that, too. Yeah.

2064
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:19,740
And so I mean, so basically, like, does this make our system look gay?

2065
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:29,740
You know, that's how I'm I'm not going to fault Perrin for the compliment or for the comment, because she's speaking of an industry 20 years ago and that whole thing.

2066
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:36,740
So I'm not I'm like, I'm not my target isn't on her for that comment, but it is just fascinating.

2067
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:40,740
And to look in retrospect, did anyone fucking care that it was purple?

2068
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:44,740
Actually, I kind of liked that original car. I love my silver game.

2069
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:47,740
The purple was fine.

2070
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:48,740
My purple.

2071
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:50,740
It's it's a weird comment.

2072
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:58,740
That second comment that talks about all the other game consoles being black and white, that Atari had a very definitive kind of wood color to it.

2073
02:05:58,740 --> 02:05:59,740
It wasn't really totally.

2074
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:01,740
That was also the 70s, Rob.

2075
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:04,740
I know, but everything was wood paneled in the 70s.

2076
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:07,740
Game systems are all sorts of colors.

2077
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:09,740
It's weird.

2078
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:12,740
Channel F was what? Orange and yellow.

2079
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:14,740
That was also the 70s, though.

2080
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:16,740
TigerCon chat says, what's wrong with purple?

2081
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:17,740
Vogue network is purple.

2082
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:18,740
Nothing.

2083
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:19,740
Nothing's wrong with purple.

2084
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:20,740
I love purple.

2085
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,740
Twitch is purple everywhere.

2086
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:26,740
Like, but again, also talking about a different market.

2087
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:30,740
Yes. And Perrin is talking about an industry 20 years ago.

2088
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:36,740
And speech is very coded for meaning one thing and saying it a different way as so not to cause offense.

2089
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:37,740
Yeah, I get it.

2090
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:43,740
But it's not the first time I've I've heard that terminology used in a homophobic light.

2091
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:48,740
You're right. She might be covering up for something way worse.

2092
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:58,740
And I understand that she got to choose her words carefully there, because, you know, if she potentially allegedly said what we are drawing conclusions to, admittedly, we don't know.

2093
02:06:58,740 --> 02:06:59,740
We weren't in the room.

2094
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:00,740
We don't know.

2095
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:07,740
But, you know, that obviously, if she'd said that very frankly, that would have caused a much bigger stink and she probably wouldn't be giving any more interviews.

2096
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:14,740
So which and probably, though, in the day, it would be said that way because.

2097
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:16,740
Yeah, I get it.

2098
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:18,740
People today are a lot more conscious of it.

2099
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:21,740
I get it. TigerClaw again with an excellent point.

2100
02:07:21,740 --> 02:07:23,740
This is the last purple thing I'm going to read, guys.

2101
02:07:23,740 --> 02:07:28,740
TigerClaw in chat says Mace Windu's lightsaber was purple from the Star Wars prequels.

2102
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:30,740
That if I remember my.

2103
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:31,740
That was Samuel's pick.

2104
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:33,740
Yeah, it was Samuel L. Jackson's pick.

2105
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:38,740
He said he would only play the part if he could have a purple lightsaber and they gave it to him.

2106
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,740
So because he's Sammy fucking L.

2107
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:42,740
Because Samuel L. Jackson's a fucking badass.

2108
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:45,740
We all know that. So he tells you to do something.

2109
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,740
You better listen.

2110
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:51,740
He needed to be in the room when they were choosing the color purple for the GameCube.

2111
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:55,740
He would have shut that down.

2112
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:57,740
Bitch.

2113
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:59,740
Exactly. All right.

2114
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:04,740
Do you recall me giving you a choice of what color you could pick?

2115
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:07,740
I don't think so.

2116
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:09,740
All right.

2117
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:10,740
It's motherfucking purple.

2118
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,740
Let's go to the listener roundtable.

2119
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:14,740
We invite your emails every week.

2120
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:17,740
Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

2121
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,740
I think I only saw a spam email in there, but I'll check with Dark Soccer.

2122
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:21,740
See if we got anything.

2123
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:23,740
There were nothing but several spam emails.

2124
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,740
Only one that cleans out spam emails.

2125
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:26,740
Apparently they found us.

2126
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:29,740
No, I get everything forwards to my personal email.

2127
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:30,740
So I know there.

2128
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:31,740
So, yeah.

2129
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:32,740
All right.

2130
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,740
It wasn't nothing was deleted, but it's fine.

2131
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:38,740
So I will invite calls if anyone wants to call in.

2132
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,740
Head on over to our discord.

2133
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:42,740
I'm watching Drag Race.

2134
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,740
Vogue network dot com slash discord.

2135
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:46,740
Oh, yeah.

2136
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:48,740
We we usually do drag race talk when there's no emails.

2137
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:51,740
But I can't watch any drag race now.

2138
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:52,740
So whatever.

2139
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:53,740
And none of it's on.

2140
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:54,740
Right.

2141
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:57,740
I mean, there's international versions, but that's what I'm saying.

2142
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,740
I can't watch.

2143
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:02,740
I don't have any of the paramount shit.

2144
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,740
OK, let's go to questions in chat, which we invite those as well.

2145
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,740
No one special.

2146
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,740
Seventy seven has a good food related question to start us off.

2147
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:13,740
I guess a little mini Orange Lounge foodie.

2148
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:17,740
Oh, do you associate eating a specific food with gaming?

2149
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:19,740
If so, what food for me?

2150
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:23,740
I associate pizza and cola with gaming on account that I went to show

2151
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:25,740
this pizza place in the early 80s.

2152
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:28,740
And that was an early experience with gaming for me.

2153
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:31,740
Does anyone associate food with gaming?

2154
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:32,740
Yes.

2155
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:37,740
Is there a cheese sticks and DDR?

2156
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:38,740
That's true.

2157
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:39,740
Where this show was born.

2158
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:40,740
Right.

2159
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:44,740
Those good ass mozzarella cheese sticks that the cafe in front of

2160
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:45,740
Golf Land sold.

2161
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:46,740
Yeah.

2162
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:47,740
All right.

2163
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:48,740
I'm with you there.

2164
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:53,740
This question is a little weird for me now after everything I talked

2165
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:59,740
about last week, but I'm not sure I have.

2166
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:04,740
I'm not sure I have, like, a Pavlov response to some sort of food

2167
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,740
and gaming like that.

2168
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:08,740
I mean, I do remember, like, like, you know, in special,

2169
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:11,740
I do remember that my like an early,

2170
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:12,740
early gaming experience,

2171
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:17,740
like my first arcade memory I very clearly remember was playing Crystal

2172
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:20,740
Castles standing on a booster because kids had to use the boosters

2173
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:23,740
because we were short and it was at a Chuck E.

2174
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,740
Cheese pizza.

2175
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:28,740
So I associate like Crystal Castles with Chuck E.

2176
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:29,740
Cheese.

2177
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:32,740
But like, why would I ever in my life crave Chuck E.

2178
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,740
Cheese pizza?

2179
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:34,740
Because the Chuck E.

2180
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:37,740
Cheese pizza back in the 80s was really good.

2181
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,740
Okay.

2182
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,740
Now, not so much.

2183
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:45,740
And also, like, I remember then, like, they kept arcades,

2184
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:48,740
like pretty dark because it's arcade games.

2185
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:50,740
You don't want the glare on the screen.

2186
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,740
So good pizza, dark arcades.

2187
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:53,740
Yes, that's the way it is.

2188
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:57,740
Now it's just like ticket spitters and bad pizza.

2189
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:58,740
I have one.

2190
02:10:58,740 --> 02:10:59,740
Okay. Yes.

2191
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:01,740
And then I have one that I know dark soccer will agree with.

2192
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,740
But you first.

2193
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:03,740
Pop Rocks.

2194
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:05,740
Oh, how's that associate with games for you?

2195
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,740
Because when I worked in an arcade,

2196
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:10,740
remember I worked at one for a while,

2197
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:12,740
I would save up all the little single tickets

2198
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:14,740
that people would leave in the machines.

2199
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:18,740
And I would redeem them for Pop Rocks during my shift.

2200
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:22,740
And then I would bounce around like a maniac my entire shift

2201
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:26,740
and then go home and crash hardcore.

2202
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:30,740
Like, I mean, the machines actually gave me migraines,

2203
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:33,740
which was pretty unfortunate given that I, you know,

2204
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:35,740
like being saying that I could work at an arcade,

2205
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:39,740
but it was Pop Rocks.

2206
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:40,740
And I mean,

2207
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:43,740
and Pop Rocks and Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks

2208
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:46,740
also got me through my first exam week of college.

2209
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:50,740
The week I didn't sleep for a week.

2210
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:54,740
Going to chat, we have a few other comments on this.

2211
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,740
Garth the Wolf says,

2212
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:57,740
I associate Halo 3 with Cheez-Its

2213
02:11:57,740 --> 02:12:00,740
because me and a friend ate them while playing together, LOL.

2214
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:05,740
And E3VL says, yeah, pizza back in the day was good,

2215
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,740
especially Pizza Hut before they changed the recipe.

2216
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:09,740
Okay, I have one more.

2217
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:11,740
Pizza Hut is so much better now.

2218
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:13,740
I have a food association, Dark Soccer.

2219
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:14,740
I know you're going to.

2220
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:21,740
It's the drink propel and the DDR days.

2221
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:26,740
And that is like if you listen to the early episodes of OLR,

2222
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:27,740
not that I would encourage people to do that,

2223
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,740
but I know some of you do it anyway.

2224
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:32,740
Like there were seriously like propel worship episodes

2225
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:33,740
of that show.

2226
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:34,740
We would drink it while doing the show.

2227
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,740
Now I can't stand that shit.

2228
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:39,740
I don't mind it, but I have the texture of it.

2229
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:41,740
I haven't checked to see if it jives

2230
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,740
with what I currently am facing,

2231
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:46,740
so probably not to be honest.

2232
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:48,740
Well, actually propel is sugar free.

2233
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:49,740
Oh, that's good.

2234
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:51,740
Okay, then I probably can have it.

2235
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,740
But I don't hate it.

2236
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:56,740
The other thing for me is Brookfield's Mini Loaves.

2237
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:58,740
Yeah, yeah.

2238
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:02,740
And I actually blame Jessica for that.

2239
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:03,740
It's good stuff.

2240
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:06,740
And now I cannot go to Brookfield's

2241
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:10,740
without being pissed off that not all of them

2242
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:11,740
will have Mini Loaves available.

2243
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:12,740
Oh, they don't?

2244
02:13:12,740 --> 02:13:13,740
That's unfortunate.

2245
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:17,740
To go with my Avgo Lemono that I've become addicted to.

2246
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:18,740
Yes.

2247
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,740
They had great chicken tortilla soup, too.

2248
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:22,740
Rob, let's go to Brookfield's.

2249
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,740
I'm challenged to eat some of the things

2250
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:25,740
I used to enjoy there.

2251
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:27,740
I guess I could always have a salad.

2252
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:28,740
There's other stuff.

2253
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:30,740
You can have me.

2254
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:32,740
Also, in a couple months,

2255
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:34,740
we can reevaluate some things

2256
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:36,740
and hopefully get to bring some things back.

2257
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:37,740
We'll see.

2258
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:38,740
We'll see.

2259
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:41,740
Okay, I did see a call sneak into the green room,

2260
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:44,740
so I want to take it because this is, of course,

2261
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:47,740
an old OLR favorite to invite back on the show here.

2262
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:50,740
So let's bring him into the room and say,

2263
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:52,740
hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

2264
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:54,740
Who's this?

2265
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:56,740
This is YYR.

2266
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,740
Hey, YYR.

2267
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:02,740
Yes, I caught the tail end of your stream.

2268
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,740
I did.

2269
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,740
Yeah, I was on mobile, so I wasn't really chatting,

2270
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:09,740
but your friend that you were playing with

2271
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,740
was playing Max 300 on standard

2272
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:13,740
and used some type of modifier

2273
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:17,740
that added extra notes in the middle of runs.

2274
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:20,740
I was like, why on earth did you do that to yourself?

2275
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:25,740
Well, we were using all kinds of crazy mods

2276
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:26,740
the entire time.

2277
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:29,740
I would definitely encourage folks to check out the VOD.

2278
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:31,740
I'll link to it in the Discord.

2279
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:36,740
But some of the things we did included, you know,

2280
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:38,740
hidden plus sudden at the same time,

2281
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:41,740
which StepMania does.

2282
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:43,740
DDR doesn't.

2283
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,740
Basically, you get to see the arrows

2284
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:47,740
for just like a very short time in the middle.

2285
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:50,740
And what else?

2286
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:52,740
I did a low-scoring set

2287
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:54,740
where I intentionally got the lowest possible passing score.

2288
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:57,740
I think I got about a 32% on expert.

2289
02:14:57,740 --> 02:15:00,740
Congrats, I think.

2290
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:04,740
I played completely silent one song.

2291
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:07,740
I played the expert chart with no audio.

2292
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:10,740
I played the expert chart with different audio.

2293
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:15,740
And then just all kinds of other crazy, silly things

2294
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:18,740
to try to break up the monotony a little bit.

2295
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:22,740
And I saw you raised some good money for charity,

2296
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:23,740
so congratulations.

2297
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:25,740
I apologize for the terrible camera angle in Discord.

2298
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:27,740
I'm doing my best here.

2299
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:29,740
But now we actually brought,

2300
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:30,740
I don't know if you were listening

2301
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:31,740
at the beginning of the show,

2302
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:32,740
but right at the beginning of the show,

2303
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:34,740
I did talk about your little announcement

2304
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:35,740
that you made at the end.

2305
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:38,740
Oh, I appreciate that.

2306
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:44,740
That you're adding the dance mode into super multitasking.

2307
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:46,740
But I couldn't remember all of the details

2308
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:47,740
about the other stuff too.

2309
02:15:47,740 --> 02:15:50,740
Can you elaborate on what else you're working with

2310
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:52,740
with super multitasking?

2311
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:55,740
Well, I mean, I have to admit,

2312
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:59,740
I didn't do much apart from, you know,

2313
02:15:59,740 --> 02:16:05,740
I didn't announce much apart from the workout mode.

2314
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:06,740
Okay.

2315
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:08,740
I'm working on the expansion.

2316
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:10,740
Oh, I see you allocated a spot for me.

2317
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:12,740
I guess I might as well do this.

2318
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:16,740
Sure.

2319
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:17,740
Access camera.

2320
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:19,740
Cool.

2321
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:20,740
Sup?

2322
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:21,740
Hi, good to see you.

2323
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:23,740
Thanks.

2324
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:27,740
So, yes, what I announced today,

2325
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:29,740
basically I'm working on the new minigames

2326
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:32,740
for the expansion that's still coming sometime next year.

2327
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:35,740
I don't want to commit to a certain time of the year,

2328
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:39,740
but several of them are done now.

2329
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:42,740
But the only one I have announced to date

2330
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:44,740
is this dance game.

2331
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:48,740
It plays on one of the thumb sticks.

2332
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:50,740
It's very simple.

2333
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,740
It only lasts for about 12 seconds,

2334
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,740
like all the others,

2335
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:55,740
and you just, you know, push in the proper direction

2336
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:56,740
when the arrow comes up.

2337
02:16:56,740 --> 02:17:01,740
But I really feel like I captured the feel of DDR pretty well.

2338
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:05,740
And it plays nicely, and I'm really excited about it.

2339
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:09,740
But I knew from the very beginning that I, you know,

2340
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:12,740
from the moment I decided to put this minigame in there,

2341
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:15,740
I knew from the very beginning that I wanted to actually put

2342
02:17:15,740 --> 02:17:18,740
a dance pad mode in the game.

2343
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:22,740
Because, I mean, because I'm ridiculous, that's why.

2344
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:27,740
And it, yeah, it actually plays really well,

2345
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:31,740
except for the fact that I need to work on the jump processing,

2346
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:34,740
because DDR and Step Mania, I don't know if you noticed this,

2347
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:40,740
but if your feet don't go down at the exact same frame

2348
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:42,740
or moment when you're jumping,

2349
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:45,740
the game has some leniency on that.

2350
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:51,740
Right now, mine doesn't have that, so it will.

2351
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:54,740
But at the moment, you have to hit the jump.

2352
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:56,740
Both feet have to go down at the exact same moment,

2353
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,740
otherwise you miss.

2354
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:02,740
But I actually threw most of it together.

2355
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:05,740
Like, the actual full-length song mode,

2356
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:07,740
I actually threw most of it together yesterday.

2357
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:12,740
So, because in the regular super multitasking dance minigame,

2358
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:13,740
there are no jumps.

2359
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:15,740
Because how are you going to do a left-right jump

2360
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:16,740
with an analog stick?

2361
02:18:16,740 --> 02:18:18,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense.

2362
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:21,740
It's going to be difficult enough, that's for sure.

2363
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:27,740
I watched you play that mode with the controller,

2364
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:29,740
because you tweeted OLR and I retweeted it

2365
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:33,740
so people could see it, and you had that,

2366
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:35,740
like you were playing the dance in the middle

2367
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:37,740
on the dance pad using a controller,

2368
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:39,740
and I just thought, I was like,

2369
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:44,740
way to make a zany, stress-filled game even more stressful.

2370
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:48,740
But hey, you can burn calories doing it, so awesome.

2371
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,740
If it makes you feel any better,

2372
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:53,740
you don't have to worry about the middle of the controller,

2373
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:56,740
the ABXY, it's just the stuff around it.

2374
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:57,740
So, just.

2375
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:59,740
I feel much better, thank you.

2376
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,740
But actually, that's not the only thing

2377
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:05,740
I wanted to talk about.

2378
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:07,740
I want to talk about a pretty awesome experience

2379
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:10,740
I had this week gaming on my Xbox

2380
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:14,740
when I actually made the few minutes to do that that I got.

2381
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:21,740
So, Forza Horizon 5, you know how great this game is,

2382
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:25,740
but the one disappointing thing about it in my eyes,

2383
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:30,740
the biggest one, was the fact that I'm still rocking

2384
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:36,740
my Xbox One X on my big TV, and when it comes to driving games,

2385
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,740
I'm a frame rate snob.

2386
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:40,740
It has to be 60 frames per second or higher,

2387
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:43,740
and I will not settle for less.

2388
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:48,740
In fact, that's why I bought my Xbox One X initially.

2389
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:50,740
It was to play Forza Horizon 4 at 60 FPS

2390
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,740
because I knew the performance mode was there,

2391
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:55,740
and it was to play Ori in 4K.

2392
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:58,740
So, and I still haven't even made the time

2393
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:01,740
to get back to the ladder yet,

2394
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:03,740
probably partially because I spent 500 hours

2395
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:05,740
playing Forza Horizon 4 on it.

2396
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:07,740
So, I got my money's worth.

2397
02:20:07,740 --> 02:20:11,740
And to be clear, there is a 60 frame mode in Forza,

2398
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:14,740
but I believe it's only on Series X and maybe S,

2399
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,740
but not the console.

2400
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,740
It's on S.

2401
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,740
Yeah.

2402
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:20,740
Yeah, unfortunately, there is absolutely no performance mode

2403
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:25,740
in Forza Horizon 5 if you're running it on an Xbox One X,

2404
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:32,740
but I actually played Forza Horizon 5

2405
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:39,740
on my Xbox One X at 60 frames per second this week.

2406
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:40,740
Oh.

2407
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:45,740
Using cloud gaming.

2408
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:48,740
Oh, clever.

2409
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:53,740
Because, first of all, you have to uninstall it from the hard drive.

2410
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:57,740
It won't offer you cloud gaming if the game is locally installed,

2411
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:00,740
but if you then launch it,

2412
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:04,740
you're going to be playing it on an Xbox Series X

2413
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:06,740
somewhere in a data center.

2414
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,740
Right.

2415
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:11,740
And you just go to the menu from the initial screen

2416
02:21:11,740 --> 02:21:14,740
and you turn on performance mode and it restarts

2417
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:19,740
and then you get the 60 FPS on a One X.

2418
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:24,740
Now, did the artifacting or any of that stuff bother you

2419
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:28,740
or were you very pleased with the experience of gaming in the cloud?

2420
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:30,740
There was definitely some artifacting.

2421
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,740
I can't hide that.

2422
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:38,740
However, if you've been watching digital cable YouTube videos,

2423
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:41,740
you know, for any length of time,

2424
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:44,740
you're probably already somewhat used to it,

2425
02:21:44,740 --> 02:21:48,740
so I actually felt like, you know, the colors weren't as good,

2426
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:51,740
they weren't as vibrant, and yeah, the artifacting was there.

2427
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:53,740
But you know what?

2428
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:56,740
I enjoyed it more than I would have a 30 FPS mode.

2429
02:21:56,740 --> 02:22:00,740
So for me, and here's the thing,

2430
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:03,740
I've used xCloud on my phone before,

2431
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:06,740
and on my computer as well,

2432
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:09,740
and there was always enough lag on it

2433
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:12,740
that I felt like it wasn't really playable,

2434
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:16,740
at least if you're moving at 200 miles per hour,

2435
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:19,740
because pretty much any lag is unacceptable.

2436
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:24,740
But on my console, mind you, it's directly wired to my router,

2437
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:28,740
but on my console, it played really, really well.

2438
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,740
I did not notice the lag.

2439
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:36,740
Yeah, the cloud gaming is getting to be more and more impressive technology,

2440
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:39,740
and that's really any piece of the cloud gaming I've used,

2441
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:42,740
whether it be Stadia, which I know Dark Soccer is very familiar with,

2442
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:45,740
or the xCloud, which I think has also been a great experience,

2443
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:49,740
or the NVIDIA thing that's also in the cloud as well,

2444
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,740
you know, have all been pretty good,

2445
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:55,740
and it's interesting because I really do think there is a good chunk of gaming

2446
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:57,740
that's kind of headed this direction.

2447
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:59,740
Now, granted, Internet isn't everywhere yet,

2448
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:01,740
but, you know, 10 years from now,

2449
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:05,740
we're going to be talking about over-the-air 5G is what we have in our house,

2450
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:07,740
and it's faster than cable,

2451
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:10,740
and it's going to be very interesting to see what that does for cloud gaming.

2452
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:14,740
Yeah, I mean, I have to say,

2453
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:18,740
my whole opinion of cloud gaming changed just in this one week,

2454
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,740
just with that one experience,

2455
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:24,740
because that basically told me that this is a viable thing,

2456
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:28,740
that, you know, this could be the future.

2457
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:30,740
It's crazy.

2458
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,740
I didn't think I would think this way,

2459
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:36,740
but, and this is after I bought an Xbox Series S

2460
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:39,740
just so I could play the game at 60 FPS,

2461
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:42,740
but it's sitting at my computer desk over there, you know,

2462
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:46,740
and I guess I like playing on my TV for some reason.

2463
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:48,740
I love that story, though.

2464
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:50,740
You should tweet that to Microsoft.

2465
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:53,740
I bet they'll be very happy with it, so interesting.

2466
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:55,740
And you know what?

2467
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:59,740
It's funny because, you know, if you play cloud gaming,

2468
02:23:59,740 --> 02:24:01,740
a lot of the time it pops up right after,

2469
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:03,740
oh, what did you think of this?

2470
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:06,740
We want your feedback, and when I tell them,

2471
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:09,740
and when I tell them, yes, it was good,

2472
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:11,740
they ask, okay, what did you like about it?

2473
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:16,740
My use case is not one of the options.

2474
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:20,740
Oh, you don't get a box to fill in to put your own thing?

2475
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:25,740
No, no, they ask you to pick one of several choices.

2476
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:27,740
I thought they let you fill it in.

2477
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:30,740
I like the fact that I could play anywhere.

2478
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:32,740
I like how it starts immediately.

2479
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,740
I like how I don't have to install anything.

2480
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:38,740
I like that it's giving me access to Series X exclusive features.

2481
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:47,740
I really do like that, and yeah, it's pretty sweet.

2482
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:49,740
And you know what?

2483
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:55,740
I bet when, you know, word spreads about how well this runs,

2484
02:24:55,740 --> 02:25:00,740
I think the resale value of some of these old VCR Xbox Ones

2485
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:03,740
might go up a little bit because, you know,

2486
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:05,740
maybe they're not worthless after all.

2487
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:11,740
Although I must say, when I got my Series S,

2488
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:17,740
I started looking at eBay to see what the resale value of an Xbox One S is.

2489
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:22,740
I don't know what the heck is going on with the console market right now

2490
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,740
because people are just bonkers.

2491
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:29,740
They're willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money for Xbox Ones

2492
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:32,740
and base PS4s right now.

2493
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:34,740
I guess it's because they can't get anything else.

2494
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:39,740
But $200 to $300 range, for the previous gen consoles,

2495
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:41,740
$200 to $300 range was commonplace.

2496
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:43,740
Wow.

2497
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:45,740
Yeah.

2498
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:47,740
It's bad.

2499
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:50,740
Well, while we are, I love that story,

2500
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:53,740
and I love what you did for your birthday stream,

2501
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:56,740
and I love that we all get to benefit with more bigger, better,

2502
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:58,740
super multitasking in the coming months.

2503
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:00,740
So if you guys haven't checked out my channel,

2504
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:04,740
So if you guys haven't checked it out on Steam already,

2505
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:06,740
what the hell are you waiting for?

2506
02:26:06,740 --> 02:26:10,740
Get on it. Super multitasking available in the storefront.

2507
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,740
I don't know how to say it.

2508
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:15,740
It's like WarioWare, but more.

2509
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:17,740
More at once.

2510
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,740
More at once.

2511
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:22,740
YYR, anything else to share with the audience before I let you go?

2512
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:25,740
I think I'm tired.

2513
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:27,740
All right. All right. Go to bed.

2514
02:26:27,740 --> 02:26:29,740
All right. Have a good night. Thanks for calling.

2515
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:31,740
We're very tired from all that dancing. Get some rest in.

2516
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:33,740
All right. Take care, buddy. It's good to hear from you.

2517
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:35,740
Great week, everybody.

2518
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:37,740
Bye-bye.

2519
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:40,740
Great to hear from our pal YYR here on the program.

2520
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:42,740
All right.

2521
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:44,740
Let me see if we had any other...

2522
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,740
No, we didn't have any other calls.

2523
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:49,740
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories.

2524
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:51,740
No.

2525
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:54,740
It's going to start to get more to that slower time of year.

2526
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:56,740
I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover next week.

2527
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:58,740
We are still going to be here Sunday night.

2528
02:26:58,740 --> 02:27:00,740
I don't know if we'll have a lot to cover.

2529
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:03,740
I really want to invite your questions and discussion topics for us.

2530
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:06,740
Mailbag... I'm sorry.

2531
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,740
The mailbag address is

2532
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:10,740
participate at orangeloungeloungeradio.com

2533
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,740
is the place where you can send us an email.

2534
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:15,740
Oh, Bobby Blackall points out the Arcade 1UP Tron.

2535
02:27:15,740 --> 02:27:17,740
Yes, that's true.

2536
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,740
Should I talk about this? I don't know.

2537
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:25,740
I'm getting a little iffy on if I want to still do London next year.

2538
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:30,740
I really, really, really, really want to go to that concert.

2539
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:34,740
The thing that's obviously with the recent news

2540
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:37,740
that I talked about last week on the show,

2541
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:40,740
I'm starting to worry if that might kind of put a damper on things,

2542
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,740
but what's really putting a damper on things

2543
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:44,740
is that COVID is coming back again,

2544
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:47,740
and now you look into all the travel restrictions.

2545
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:49,740
You want to go over there. You still have to get tested.

2546
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,740
This is even if you're vaccinated.

2547
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,740
You still have to get tested on the second day that you're there.

2548
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:57,740
So it's like you have to spend money to do that and time to do that.

2549
02:27:57,740 --> 02:28:01,740
So I'm starting to wonder if I just shouldn't

2550
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:04,740
axe that trip and get myself a Tron Arcade 1UP

2551
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:07,740
and some of the other things, but we'll see,

2552
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:09,740
to be determined on that.

2553
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:13,740
I got an Arcade 1UP actually just last week.

2554
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:15,740
Oh, yeah. Tell us about this because I saw the tweet.

2555
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:17,740
I got the tabletop Dig Dug.

2556
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:19,740
Oh, I didn't know it was tabletop.

2557
02:28:19,740 --> 02:28:22,740
I thought it was the standing one. Oh, that's cool.

2558
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:26,740
Yeah, I got the tabletop Dig Dug to go with our tabletop Galaga.

2559
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:28,740
Oh, I love that.

2560
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:31,740
I didn't know there was a Dig Dug branded one.

2561
02:28:31,740 --> 02:28:33,740
I imagine it's the same like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man,

2562
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:35,740
like all the Namco stuff in it, but that's pretty cool.

2563
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:39,740
Yeah, it's just Dig Dug and Dig Dug 2.

2564
02:28:39,740 --> 02:28:42,740
These are a little bit more limited.

2565
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:45,740
Oh, oh, not like cocktail tabletop.

2566
02:28:45,740 --> 02:28:47,740
I know what you're talking about. I wanted that Dig Dug 1.

2567
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:49,740
I couldn't find it anywhere. Oh, I want it.

2568
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:54,740
They had exactly one left at a Ross Dress for Less.

2569
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:55,740
Wow.

2570
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:57,740
If I find another.

2571
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:58,740
Yeah, let me know.

2572
02:28:58,740 --> 02:28:59,740
I will grab it for you.

2573
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:02,740
I'll have to check those kind of stores in the area to see.

2574
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:07,740
Along with the other stuff that I've bought for you that I haven't given you.

2575
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:09,740
I still have a thing for you from L.A.

2576
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:10,740
That's right.

2577
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:12,740
I still have a thing for you from L.A., yeah.

2578
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:14,740
I've got things in the pipeline.

2579
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:16,740
All right.

2580
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:17,740
All right.

2581
02:29:17,740 --> 02:29:21,740
Well, if there's no other stories, then I think we'll go ahead and wrap it all up for tonight.

2582
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:24,740
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning into Orange Launch Radio and listening to our show.

2583
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:28,740
Whether you were here with us live or listening on the podcast feed, thank you for being here.

2584
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:30,740
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2585
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:33,740
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2586
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:35,740
but we need the voices to be here.

2587
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:41,740
So, yes, please consider following us on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network.

2588
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:45,740
A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Spotify, wherever did you find this show.

2589
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:47,740
Those go an awful long way as well.

2590
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:51,740
The merch shop is currently closed for maintenance, but we'll be bringing that back soon.

2591
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:55,740
Thanks to everyone who's gone out of their way and supported us with that in the past.

2592
02:29:55,740 --> 02:29:59,740
And we look forward to maybe this will be an opportunity for some new merch in the future.

2593
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:04,740
I think that's all I have to say in my little spiel.

2594
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:07,740
So, we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap on up.

2595
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:12,740
Dark Sakura will be keeping the party going with the after party and her dead by daylight.

2596
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:16,740
So, I will go to her first with her final thought.

2597
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:23,740
I should probably just play no-ed just for the sake of pissing people off tonight.

2598
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:24,740
I might do that.

2599
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,740
An all no-ed stream. Love it.

2600
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:29,740
An all no-ed stream and I want to see who it's going to be the meme.

2601
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:34,740
I'll use no-ed and then see if anybody gets a tree trunk up their ass over it.

2602
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:40,740
No-ed, haunted ground, I'm trying to think of the other like exposed iron maiden.

2603
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:44,740
My pig build is pretty mean as it is.

2604
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:50,740
Especially if I do like number two rule set and tamper timer when I don't have the VHS tape.

2605
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:54,740
I don't know. I'm pretty mean already.

2606
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:58,740
But how about a doctor with no-ed or a Freddy with no-ed?

2607
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:00,740
All right. All right.

2608
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,740
Have fun being sweaty.

2609
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:04,740
I will see you in a little bit after the show.

2610
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:08,740
Sweaty? That removes the sweat factor altogether.

2611
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:10,740
All right. Take care.

2612
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:12,740
All right. Bye.

2613
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:16,740
All right. And we'll go to Loki for your final thought tonight.

2614
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:21,740
My final thought is I'm going to be very busy this week getting the last few episodes put together for my series.

2615
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:25,740
And I can't wait to start the new stuff.

2616
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:31,740
My final thought I didn't stream as much as last week because I've really been trying to keep make room for Alan to stream.

2617
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:36,740
And I've been really into this ingress event that's going on right now and trying to get more exercise.

2618
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:39,740
And I hit some really good exercise goals I did yesterday and today.

2619
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:41,740
Ten thousand steps. That's five miles.

2620
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:44,740
So that's something I'm obviously with everything I've been talking about last week.

2621
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:51,740
But some of the signs of me doing good things is showing up already, which is very encouraging because it's only been a couple of weeks.

2622
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:53,740
So just y'all keep your fingers and your toes crossed.

2623
02:31:53,740 --> 02:31:59,740
I can stay on this route because I would love to not that I'm going to kid myself this is going to go away completely,

2624
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:03,740
but I'd love to just be in a in a capacity with a little more flexibility.

2625
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:06,740
So we'll see. Fingers and toes crossed. Yes.

2626
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:09,740
You heard Matt says I didn't participate in community today was traveling.

2627
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:13,740
I only got five. I walked five miles and got five shiny shinxes.

2628
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:16,740
But that's plenty. I don't I don't need 40.

2629
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:20,740
I didn't check in with Shane to see how many he got to maybe check in for after the credits.

2630
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:25,740
All right. That is going to do it, though, for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2631
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:28,740
Thanks again. We'll see you in seven days for those of you in the states.

2632
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:31,740
Have a great Thanksgiving for everybody around the world.

2633
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:36,740
We are thankful for you tuning in and supporting our show each and every week.

2634
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:42,740
Or even if this is the first week, I'm thankful you got to the end of the show because we had some angries earlier.

2635
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:48,740
So I appreciate you guys sticking with it. Happy gaming. Enjoy any of the new games you picked up this week.

2636
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:51,740
We'll be back to do it again in seven days. Have a great night, everybody.
