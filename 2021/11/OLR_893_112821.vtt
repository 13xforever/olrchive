00:00.000 --> 00:14.280
It's another week in a very wild gaming world with all manner of continuing stories,

00:14.280 --> 00:17.640
new rumors, new deals, old new deals, and plenty more.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.760
My favorite headline?

00:18.760 --> 00:22.440
Sony teasing that they're not out of the mobile space yet, but they are back in the

00:22.440 --> 00:24.240
position of having to play catch up.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.160
We hope the holiday was great for those who celebrate, and for those who didn't, we

00:27.160 --> 00:28.440
hope the sales were helpful.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.760
But they're over yet, of course.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.200
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki with this week's gaming

00:34.200 --> 00:37.520
news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.520 --> 00:46.840
Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every

00:46.840 --> 00:48.400
gamer has a voice.

00:48.400 --> 00:54.920
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 893 of our

00:54.920 --> 00:58.760
show for this November the 28th of 2021.

00:58.760 --> 01:04.840
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined live on this Sunday evening post-Thanksgiving and

01:04.840 --> 01:07.540
first night of Hanukkah with my co-host.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.960
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
Sup.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.960
Hi, how are you?

01:12.960 --> 01:15.160
I'm okay.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Happy Hanukkah.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
Happy Hanukkah.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.160
Yeah.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.800
How was your Thanksgiving festivities and celebration?

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
It was all right.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
Dan got a kidney stone.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Oh, no.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.680
Oh, I know we were texting about that, so I was confirmed that's what it was?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
Oh, bummer.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
Pretty much.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.680
I mean, and I think he passed it because he doesn't hurt anymore, so...

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
Well, that's good.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.680
Yeah.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.680
Yeah.

01:34.680 --> 01:39.240
So I was taking care of him, and then I had to go to Ikea today, which makes me regret

01:39.240 --> 01:42.520
every single choice in my life that led up to that moment.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.520
That's like a kidney stone of the soul.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.000
Well hello, Tech Master Loki, there with the witty little one-liners we're used to, and

01:49.000 --> 01:50.680
I hope you're doing well as well.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.360
Happy Hanukkah to you and the Mrs. as well, Loki.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.920
Thank you.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.160
So, I gotta go back to Dark Sakura for a minute with the whole Ikea thing.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.800
Did you at least get to reward yourself with meatballs or something lemon berry flavored?

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
No.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
No.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Oh, that's a question.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.320
Because the eatery thing, they didn't even have cinnamon rolls ready.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
What?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
What?

02:11.320 --> 02:15.360
And I was like, so I made another mistake.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.320
I went to Taco Bell for the first time in four years.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.320
Oh, boy.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
Yeah.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320
And...

02:21.320 --> 02:22.320
Yeah.

02:22.320 --> 02:26.680
I ate half of the quesadilla.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.920
And I further regretted my life's decisions that led up to that particular moment.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.960
I gave the rest of it to Dan, who's like, okay, I'm fine.

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
Great.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.080
Del Taco is far superior.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.720
Let it be known.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.800
You know, the supply chain issues are very serious when Ikea does not have cinnamon rolls

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
on time.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.800
This is like...

02:44.800 --> 02:49.040
It wasn't that they had just been sold out and they had another batch baking and I didn't

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
want to wait for it.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.220
Going to our chat, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice

02:54.220 --> 02:57.020
of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:57.020 --> 02:58.020
That's V-O-G network.

02:58.020 --> 03:02.480
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.880
Hey, folks listening on the podcast feed, consider following us on Twitch.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
We really would appreciate it.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.280
We do some special stuff outside Sunday nights once in a while.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.800
I know we have a special coming up soon.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.280
We'll talk a little bit about that later.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.840
But SHO 100 Mountain Chat says, oh, I like Ikea, but your soul is ripped from you every

03:17.840 --> 03:19.320
moment you're there.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.800
Never feel more drained than being in an Ikea for two hours.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Yeah.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.240
I get claustrophobia because it's hard to find your way out.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.480
That's the thing about Ikea.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.300
You can literally get lost in there.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.960
And it's a little disorienting.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
Ugh.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.940
Um, Loki, how are you?

03:35.940 --> 03:36.940
How was your Thanksgiving?

03:36.940 --> 03:37.940
Uh, busy.

03:37.940 --> 03:47.280
I just, you know, uh, we went over to my mama's house and had dinner there and just been playing

03:47.280 --> 03:51.760
and you're an entertainer for the kids the entire week.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.840
Well, it's an important role that somebody's got to do it, but they go back to school tomorrow,

03:55.840 --> 03:56.840
right?

03:56.840 --> 03:57.840
Yes, thankfully.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.840
There's that.

03:58.840 --> 04:04.320
Oh, you had, didn't you have the week off to work on your, uh, like videos and stuff?

04:04.320 --> 04:05.400
Yeah, I did.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.480
So I have been still working on that actually.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.040
Um, cause so next week on Tuesday actually is one 18.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.680
That's when the new update comes out for Minecraft.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.920
And so around that time, the servers are going to be resetting.

04:20.920 --> 04:28.040
So you know, our server on a collusion, I'm, I know they're talking about it.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.820
Must be in another chat other than the discord I'm in, cause I don't see much conversation

04:32.820 --> 04:33.820
going on.

04:33.820 --> 04:41.100
Um, with NerdCraft, I know that they're talking about restarting soon as well.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.760
So it's basically time to kind of wrap up my series.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.320
And so I've been working on the last, um, episode of my series.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.720
So I finished my builds.

04:51.720 --> 04:59.520
I, um, I've been touring the entire server, trying to figure out who everyone's bases

04:59.520 --> 05:05.640
belong to, um, because we didn't have a really good system for that.

05:05.640 --> 05:10.440
So I've been just trying to like forensically figure out who's base belongs to what and

05:10.440 --> 05:15.360
get like some shots of them and like trying to put that all together.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.720
So that's, what's been taken up a ton of my time recently.

05:17.720 --> 05:24.020
Cause there's like so many, we had 70 people on the server, like whitelisted on there.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.640
Not necessarily that they all played or played for a long time, but there's bases everywhere

05:28.640 --> 05:31.960
and it's hard to know what belongs to what.

05:31.960 --> 05:37.240
So I've been just doing my best to try to capture all of them, but I'm sure I'm going

05:37.240 --> 05:39.880
to miss something, but yeah.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.440
So that's what I've been working on recently is just that I've got, like, so all my builds

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
are done now.

05:44.440 --> 05:49.560
Um, I just need to actually, I need to film my, the last part of my builds.

05:49.560 --> 05:54.040
I'm not necessarily doing a time-lapse cause I don't have time for that, but just capture

05:54.040 --> 05:58.960
like kind of all the stuff that I built and everything and then, um, just wrap it up.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.720
So probably have one more episode left and that's it for this, this season.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.920
Looking forward to that.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.400
Um, and, uh, next week is a pretty big week in gaming for us here at OLR cause you've

06:09.400 --> 06:14.160
got Minecraft, you got a big patch in Minecraft for that and all the content you do, uh, Final

06:14.160 --> 06:17.240
Fantasy XIV Heavensward early access this Friday.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.000
So by this time next week, I'll finally be playing a new XIV expansion.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Very exciting for me.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.120
I'm so ready for it.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.940
Yes, you might recall, we talked a couple of weeks ago about how it was delayed by two

06:26.940 --> 06:28.160
whole weeks.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.600
So they're really putting the finishing touches on it now.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.600
So we're in that period where I should be playing Endwalker, but I'm not, but that's

06:34.600 --> 06:37.760
okay because I'm not a dick when it comes to delayed games.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.760
It is what it is.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.720
Uh, so, but it'll be, it'll be nice to finally be playing that and, uh, well hopefully Dark

06:42.720 --> 06:43.880
Soccer gets something too.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.200
Have they, uh, have they announced the release date for that cool new killer, the artist

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
in Dead by Daylight?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Is that Tuesday?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
I think like tomorrow.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
Okay.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.200
So everybody's getting something.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
Yeah.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.760
You get DLC and you get DLC and you get DLC.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.920
I also do have Final Fantasy XIV, you know.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
Oh, that's true.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.040
I just, I know you, you don't put in as many hours as I do.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.040
Yeah.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.720
I think it's really, I think it's really cool of them to make Prince a new killer in Dead

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720
by Daylight.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.720
I mean, that to be really interesting.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
Oh yeah.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.720
The artist.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Yes.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.680
This is the polar opposite of Prince.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.340
Although I wouldn't mind a killer with like a guitar type of thing.

07:21.340 --> 07:25.560
I don't know how that would work, but I would, we already have Kate and she's a killer enough.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.200
Oh yeah.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
All Kate's are toxic.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200
All right.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.200
All Kate's are toxic.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.920
Anyhow, we'll talk more about the games we play in a little bit, but first I want to

07:34.920 --> 07:36.960
get into our kickoff topic tonight.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
I'm going to be honest.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.680
It's probably going to be a shorter show here tonight just because with Thanksgiving going

07:41.680 --> 07:45.200
on in the U S and I hope everybody out there had a great Thanksgiving, whatever you ended

07:45.200 --> 07:46.200
up doing.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.800
We had a very small gathering because I didn't talk about mine.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.320
We had a very small gathering with my dad.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.560
It's literally just the three of us, but how's your dad doing?

07:52.560 --> 07:53.560
He's good.

07:53.560 --> 07:57.400
It's really nice to see him and spend a little time with him and he's, he's had some ups

07:57.400 --> 08:03.020
and I guess I'll just say a friend of his passed away and you know, it's just, it, it's

08:03.020 --> 08:07.400
rough when, you know, well, how do I phrase this?

08:07.400 --> 08:11.480
Like, you know, when you watch those older than you, especially in their eighties, like

08:11.480 --> 08:16.280
my dad is where it's like my friends are passing away, like that's just really tough to watch

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
and so forth.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.800
Another one of his friends is in a home and dad, if you're watching, I'm sorry, but I'm

08:21.800 --> 08:26.800
thinking you know, it does, it does gets worse and I absolutely feel for it.

08:26.800 --> 08:33.600
I remember my grandmom losing a lot of friends, so, so, but I was sometimes my dad watches,

08:33.600 --> 08:38.040
so I'm sorry if you had to hear that, but I just means I'm thinking of my dad and I'm

08:38.040 --> 08:42.320
really treasuring the holiday time that we do get to spend together and so forth.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.960
He will pop in on his iPad once in a while, so I want to make sure I say that as well.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
As well you should.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.840
Yes, as well I should.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.800
So where was I going with that?

08:52.800 --> 08:57.240
So oh yes, so I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving as well, although I know we do.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.200
We are fortunate enough to have international listeners.

08:59.200 --> 09:05.960
We have people in Canada, Mexico, Australia, all the various countries in Europe, all over.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.820
We have listeners everywhere around the globe and we're very thankful for that.

09:08.820 --> 09:13.240
So I know not everybody had Thanksgiving, but I hope you had a great week and everybody's

09:13.240 --> 09:18.100
starting to get Black Friday for whatever crazy capitalist reasons.

09:18.100 --> 09:22.280
So if that's a thing you're into, I hope you got some good deals.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.160
I know Cyber Monday coming up is a big thing as well.

09:25.160 --> 09:32.160
I suppose Steam sales are something, you know, or whatever online shop you choose to go to.

09:32.160 --> 09:36.040
I'm sure if no one special was in chat right now, he'd be reminding us, oh, there's these

09:36.040 --> 09:37.600
other stores too, not just Steam.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.400
But you know, with all those online sales, I think it's pretty hard to resist a lot of

09:41.400 --> 09:42.780
great deals in gaming right now.

09:42.780 --> 09:47.520
So I hope you're finding some good deals wherever you are throughout the world.

09:47.520 --> 09:52.320
And if you see some good deals on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, let me know, because that Amazon

09:52.320 --> 09:56.900
one sold out before I could get one, although a good tip from Bobby's show, because we do

09:56.900 --> 10:00.160
tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

10:00.160 --> 10:02.760
Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.000
And Bobby was saying on his show tonight that, hey, if you can't find an ultimate Game Pass

10:07.000 --> 10:11.920
Ultimate card, get an Xbox Live Gold card if you see a good deal, because those convert

10:11.920 --> 10:15.240
at about a third, because they're about a third of the price.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.120
So like if you get a year of gold, it'll convert to like four months of ultimate.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.680
So yeah, if I find a good deal for that, heck yeah, I would do that as well.

10:24.680 --> 10:31.660
Anyhow, I want to here at the top of the show, get into our kickoff topic, which goes back

10:31.660 --> 10:37.080
to our roots a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio and a little company we've really followed

10:37.080 --> 10:38.760
their up and downs over the years.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.300
And that's a company called Harmonix.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.340
And I talk about the ups.

10:42.340 --> 10:48.660
I remember, and I'm sure Dark Soccer and Loki remember fondly when Harmonix was a vendor

10:48.660 --> 10:56.760
in Kensho Hall at E3 that was showing off their guitars that they were making for import

10:56.760 --> 10:59.660
Japanese games like Guitar Freaks.

10:59.660 --> 11:04.660
But these guitars had five buttons on them for some reason that we didn't know, because

11:04.660 --> 11:08.660
if you didn't know the Japanese Guitar Freaks game, they only use three buttons.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.660
And we always, why are there five buttons?

11:10.660 --> 11:15.540
And of course, we found out years later, oh, Harmonix got into bigger and better things.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.880
They had some downs when they published in the groove.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.880
And that's no shit.

11:19.880 --> 11:24.120
You know, we had Kyle on the show years ago and, you know, we talked out a lot of our,

11:24.120 --> 11:28.700
you know, kind of things we can see on the back of Harmonix published in the groove.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.700
If I remember right.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.700
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.700
I'm always positive.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.500
I thought that was Red Octane that did that.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.100
Am I confusing Harmonix and Red Octane?

11:35.100 --> 11:36.100
I sure am.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.420
I think you're confusing Red Octane with them.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.140
Yeah, Red Octane published in the groove.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.540
I sure am.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.740
And I was thinking, why am I confusing them?

11:43.740 --> 11:45.140
Did they work together on something else?

11:45.140 --> 11:46.140
They must have.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.100
Oh, boy, my grandpa games kicking in.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.500
They had to have collaborated on something because I remember associating this.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.740
Oh, it was it was OK.

11:53.740 --> 12:02.620
I was it was Guitar Hero because Red Octane did those original peripherals for the harmonix

12:02.620 --> 12:03.820
game.

12:03.820 --> 12:04.820
That part.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.500
That's where I'm bleeding it together there.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.500
Yeah.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.540
Bobby Blackwell says Red Octane did the hardware.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.540
Harmonix did the software.

12:12.540 --> 12:13.540
OK, put very so.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.780
OK, so I'm not completely off base and just a little.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.780
Yeah.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.780
For the original.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.860
This was before Activision or any of that stuff.

12:21.860 --> 12:23.340
Yeah.

12:23.340 --> 12:28.740
So anyway, so harmonix, then, of course, their big breakthrough stuff was on the PlayStation

12:28.740 --> 12:29.740
two.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.420
They had frequency and amplitude.

12:32.420 --> 12:37.060
And then they got into, if I remember right, karaoke revolution and some of those, I think

12:37.100 --> 12:39.940
the first karaoke revolution was harmonix developed.

12:39.940 --> 12:40.940
Right.

12:40.940 --> 12:46.540
I know Konami published it, but I think the early ones were done by them and they they

12:46.540 --> 12:47.540
did a lot.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.180
So, OK, thank you.

12:49.180 --> 12:55.220
Bobby says, yes, Activision bought Red Octane, who had the Guitar Hero IP, which is why harmonix

12:55.220 --> 12:57.820
was bought by MTV and did rock band.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.460
That's how that all went down.

12:59.460 --> 13:00.460
That whole thing.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.460
Thank you.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.460
OK.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.460
So I was only a little crazy.

13:03.980 --> 13:10.220
But harmonix, obviously, you know, we have been following whether correctly or not for

13:10.220 --> 13:13.380
the past many, many years of this show.

13:13.380 --> 13:20.820
I remember when Guitar Hero first came out, you guys were on the news about it.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.940
I wasn't because I couldn't be there that day.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.880
I think that clip is still on YouTube somewhere.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.780
Is that where the Loki it's no, no, no.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.140
That is not where the Loki it's so much fun clip comes from.

13:30.140 --> 13:33.320
That was a different that was the one I was there for when they talked about podcasting

13:33.320 --> 13:34.320
and we were in it.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.540
But there's that there's a clip out there because they went to Jamie's house.

13:36.540 --> 13:37.540
You remember this?

13:37.540 --> 13:41.040
And they did the Guitar Hero interview and you guys got to play it.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.880
And it was on the news and all that stuff.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.280
So that was cool.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
And then that's pretty fun.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
Yeah.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.280
Yeah.

13:48.280 --> 13:52.480
It was it was it was nice when people gave a shit about what we had to say.

13:52.480 --> 13:56.600
But harmonix, you know, they've they've had some ups and downs.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.360
They developed some pretty cool stuff, you know, in VR.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.760
But then not everything took off.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.380
Like they tried to do a music game shooter that didn't end up get really taken up off

14:05.380 --> 14:06.440
the ground.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.920
I personally was not a fan of the Kickstarter frequency game.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.720
I know other people were.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.640
I still wanted to see harmonix do very well.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.840
Well, and then some could argue they have done very well.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.360
They have they have been sold.

14:19.360 --> 14:26.080
This week is the news is that Epic has purchased harmonix.

14:26.080 --> 14:32.440
And it actually goes a step further because we know exactly why Epic bought harmonix,

14:32.440 --> 14:37.800
because it actually says in a statement that the Fortnite folks put out or Epic put out

14:37.800 --> 14:42.360
is that harmonix will continue to support the existing slate of games.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.000
So there will still be rock band stuff.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.240
There will still be Fuser stuff.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.180
And anything that's still on Steam will be there.

14:48.180 --> 14:57.580
But Epic and harmonix will now be collaborating on music based enhancements for Fortnite,

14:57.580 --> 15:01.220
which at first glance, you probably go, what the fuck?

15:01.220 --> 15:06.060
Fortnite is a is a shooty shooty bang bang game.

15:06.060 --> 15:11.260
But of course, you might recall about six or seven weeks here ago on the show, maybe

15:11.260 --> 15:12.260
longer.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.180
Time is a construct.

15:14.180 --> 15:19.020
So we were talking about the Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite.

15:19.020 --> 15:24.640
And I was mentioning how, you know, considering Fortnite has this reputation as battle royale

15:24.640 --> 15:26.520
shooty shooty bang bang.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.540
This Ariana Grande concert was actually one of the neater things that got me to kind of

15:30.540 --> 15:35.180
turn my head and pay attention to what Fortnite was doing, because it essentially was an interactive

15:35.180 --> 15:36.840
music video is what they did.

15:36.840 --> 15:43.180
And it just kind of used the Fortnite engine and the Fortnite world to kind of do that.

15:43.180 --> 15:47.220
So when you look at something like that, and then you think, oh, harmonix is going

15:47.220 --> 15:49.140
to be working with music based stuff.

15:49.140 --> 15:55.500
I also think about Fusor and how, you know, Fusor and its predecessor drop mix the in

15:55.500 --> 16:02.500
person game, how those two were really good at like blending music together and letting

16:02.500 --> 16:08.460
you do your own type of musical type of experience like, you know, the the music that you end

16:08.460 --> 16:10.980
up making in Fusor is kind of rad.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.740
Like it's fun like to play with those old songs, right?

16:13.740 --> 16:18.860
So to think that some of that could be what Fortnite, I mean, we don't know exactly what

16:18.860 --> 16:22.940
they are doing for Fortnite, but it could be something along those lines where you're

16:22.940 --> 16:27.960
making the own your own soundtrack to your own experience.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.820
And possibly as people are building their own worlds and, you know, doing the things

16:31.820 --> 16:36.140
that they're doing in Fortnite besides just battle royale, maybe folks are going to be

16:36.140 --> 16:40.700
able to leverage harmonic types of tools, harmonix types of tools to build their own

16:40.700 --> 16:46.980
soundtracks and musical experiences and build their own Ariana Grande concerts within Fortnite.

16:46.980 --> 16:50.540
That's kind of what I take from this announcement.

16:50.540 --> 16:51.540
I don't know.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.180
Loki, what did you think about the whole thing?

16:54.180 --> 16:57.580
I mean, it's just.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.340
I'm glad, you know, honestly, I'm kind of glad that someone bought them because, like,

17:02.340 --> 17:05.340
I don't know what they've been doing recently.

17:05.340 --> 17:10.700
I don't know if they would have the financial backing to last much longer.

17:10.700 --> 17:15.380
I mean, it just doesn't seem like that they're kind of the heyday harmonics that we used

17:15.380 --> 17:16.380
to know.

17:16.380 --> 17:20.540
So it'd be good to have the financial backing of Epic and hopefully Epic just lets them

17:20.540 --> 17:27.100
kind of do what they want to do and be creative, kind of like how they've done with like, oh,

17:27.100 --> 17:32.540
gosh, Rocket League and that kind of stuff where they own them, but they're kind of doing

17:32.540 --> 17:34.900
their own thing.

17:34.940 --> 17:38.700
So I'm curious to see what they kind of do with that, because, you know, Harmonics is

17:38.700 --> 17:41.060
a very creative company.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.300
And, you know, they've been doing a lot of creative things.

17:44.300 --> 17:49.340
Chat would like to remind you Fuser is a recent release, but I will give you the fact that

17:49.340 --> 17:54.540
Fuser was essentially a port of drop mix, you know, of sorts.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.100
But anyway, just to be fair, they have been putting out things recently.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.100
Right.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.100
Yeah.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.340
And I know they have, but I don't think they've been like wildly successful, like, say, Rock

18:03.340 --> 18:04.780
Band was or something like that.

18:04.780 --> 18:05.780
I mean, sure.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.780
Sure.

18:06.780 --> 18:07.780
Probably not necessarily.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.780
Nothing's going to be.

18:08.780 --> 18:09.780
Yeah, right.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.780
Exactly.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.820
So I would say, though, it's good to see that they have a financial backing of a company

18:13.820 --> 18:14.820
like that.

18:14.820 --> 18:18.940
Hopefully that allows them to be able to make some of these things that they haven't been

18:18.940 --> 18:19.940
able to get off the ground.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.180
We don't have to do any more kickstarters for games and stuff like that.

18:23.180 --> 18:27.060
They can just make and publish the stuff that they want to make.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
Sure.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.260
It may be under like the Fortnite brand or something like that.

18:30.260 --> 18:33.980
But Fortnite has been getting kind of creative on its own with different things.

18:33.980 --> 18:39.100
So it wouldn't be surprising that they incorporate something with that, because it is a huge

18:39.100 --> 18:40.100
brand.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.140
Well, and I wonder if harmonics is concept of the music game shooter.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.060
And I'm sorry, I forgot what it was called.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.060
Something about.

18:46.060 --> 18:53.780
I don't remember somebody in chat will remember, but maybe there are concepts from that that

18:53.780 --> 18:58.460
were interesting because, you know, let's say, OK, Fortnite is a shooty shooty bang bang.

18:58.460 --> 19:03.140
Maybe they want to do a music mode type of thing to draw in a different audience that

19:03.140 --> 19:07.020
tends to write off Fortnite as a shooty shooty bang bang game.

19:07.020 --> 19:13.420
So maybe they are trying to partner up with companies that do radically different things

19:13.420 --> 19:16.020
to bring radically different experiences to Fortnite.

19:16.020 --> 19:20.900
And maybe, you know, I know I'm reaching here, but maybe some of that music game shooter

19:20.900 --> 19:26.460
stuff will have its day after all in Fortnite.

19:26.460 --> 19:30.820
Going to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping live tonight,

19:30.820 --> 19:34.460
SG100Matt says, I guess I'm OK with Epic buying them.

19:34.460 --> 19:38.140
If it was EA, they would be dissolved or forced to work on a battlefield game.

19:38.140 --> 19:41.060
I guess they're going to be working on Fortnite, but it could be worse.

19:41.060 --> 19:45.660
Yeah, it could be worse, especially, you know, if you're I don't know, I have my ups and

19:45.660 --> 19:47.100
downs with Epic.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.420
There's a lot of things I like that Epic does.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.540
There's a lot of things I don't like that Epic does.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.780
And namely, it's Tim Sweeney's Twitter account.

19:53.780 --> 19:58.660
But that's a whole other topic for a different day.

19:58.660 --> 20:05.060
Yeah, I mean, I would like to see Fortnite as far as the whole metaverse concept, right,

20:05.060 --> 20:08.940
which seems to be this big thing we're moving into in the 20s.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.580
Everybody wants to it's the metaverse in 20s.

20:12.580 --> 20:17.020
Literally that company called Meta that I'm still calling Facebook wants to do it.

20:17.020 --> 20:20.060
Niantic has talked about their wanting to do it.

20:20.060 --> 20:21.480
Fortnite wants to do it in their own way.

20:21.480 --> 20:26.040
And these are all three very different approaches to the metaverse.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.900
And there's other companies wanting to do this as well.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.140
As long as they all stay the fuck away from NFTs.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.980
Tigerclaw in chat says, what if Valve were to buy them?

20:34.980 --> 20:36.260
Well, that would have been cool.

20:36.260 --> 20:41.660
But OK, you want to talk about a company that really hasn't done any games lately.

20:41.660 --> 20:42.660
Let's talk about Valve.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.500
Well, I guess there was Half-Life Alyx, but how long did that take?

20:45.500 --> 20:47.100
How long did that take?

20:47.100 --> 20:53.460
We're all bitter that there's no Portal 3 or Half-Life 3 or anything 3.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.460
So yeah.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.020
Dr. C says, I agree with Rob.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.420
I wonder if they'll do something like that in Fortnite.

20:59.420 --> 21:06.260
I suppose only time will tell, but we know Fortnite craves those musical experiences

21:06.260 --> 21:08.700
as evidenced by the variety.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.140
It's not just Ariana Grande.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.460
That's just the one that got my attention as a gay.

21:12.460 --> 21:13.940
I have to support that.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.140
But there's lots of what Travis Scott had a concert in Fortnite, too.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.140
There's been countless.

21:18.140 --> 21:21.780
I remember there was a Weezer album that debuted in Fortnite because I actually looked at that

21:21.780 --> 21:23.000
level and that whole thing.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
It actually got me to look.

21:25.040 --> 21:33.800
So I'm curious to see what music can do to change the conversation of Fortnite from its

21:33.800 --> 21:35.680
just Battle Royale.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.000
I think that could be very interesting.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.120
So we'll see.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.760
And best of luck to everyone at Harmonix.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.920
I just hope this doesn't mean layoffs or any of this garbage.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.520
I hope it means more people and more folks to help on all that stuff.

21:47.520 --> 21:52.040
Because we know Epic has oodles and oodles of money.

21:52.080 --> 21:57.200
Speaking of Epic and that whole thing, Dark Soccer, relevant to your interest, certainly,

21:57.200 --> 22:00.840
and I'm sure you're already aware, Dead by Daylight is going to be free on the Epic store

22:00.840 --> 22:07.200
next week because this is the big launch of Dead by Daylight on the Epic store.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.200
It's not there yet.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.160
But apparently it is going to be cross purchases with Steam, Stadia.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.160
I think that's it.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
Because Switch isn't in on that.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.160
Steam and Stadia are the only two that have.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
Oh, Windows Store.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
Windows Store.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
I forgot.

22:20.160 --> 22:26.640
Windows Store doesn't have the tie in to the behavior account.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.640
You are right.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.880
Stadia and Steam do right now.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
You are right.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
Sorry.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.920
I was thinking about the postgame chat and how they do have that.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.880
But anyway, that's that's totally different.

22:34.880 --> 22:41.040
Yeah, no, but and actually the thing is, is that it's really just cross progression.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.160
I still had to buy all my DLC on Steam and Stadia.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.800
I didn't know that.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
Gross.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.440
Well, cross progression is nice, at least, I guess.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.200
So well, yeah.

22:53.200 --> 22:58.600
And for those of you that I think all of my in-game purchases, like my cosmetics and whatnot,

22:58.600 --> 22:59.800
those carry over with me.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.280
OK, that makes sense.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.700
Probably everything original probably carries over.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.560
Just not the license stuff is probably the tricky thing with that.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.920
No, the license stuff should carry over, I mean, because I bought the Stranger Things

23:10.920 --> 23:12.920
DLC on Steam.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.680
Oh, nice.

23:14.680 --> 23:19.840
So I'll have that on both because I paid for them on both.

23:19.840 --> 23:26.080
But my in-game stuff, because I bought, you know, Jonathan Byers as one of my characters,

23:26.080 --> 23:27.900
you know, the skin for Steve.

23:27.900 --> 23:33.680
I should have I have all of the Stranger Things content and it should carry over.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.640
I just don't have a PC I can test it on.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
Fair.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.880
Unless we logged into my Steam account or something on your computer to test it out.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.880
I don't know.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.880
Yeah.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.360
Well, if you're if you're sick of hearing Dark Sakura and I talk about Dead by Daylight

23:46.360 --> 23:51.280
all the time, this is this this is your chance to see if it's for you because it and for

23:51.280 --> 23:53.900
whatever reason, you don't have Game Pass either and have checked it out that way.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.800
It will be free on the Epic Store next week.

23:55.800 --> 24:00.840
So you can keyboard and mouse away or plug in a controller, do it that way, whatever.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
So there you go.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.480
I guess there is that particular PSA about that.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.700
But yeah, Epic Games has bought Harmonix.

24:07.700 --> 24:12.300
So we will see how this partnership develops, but it's probably going to be several months

24:12.720 --> 24:15.980
before we see any of that result.

24:15.980 --> 24:20.020
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

24:20.020 --> 24:21.720
been playing this week.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.820
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.940
How was your gaming week?

24:24.940 --> 24:30.820
I played Dead by Daylight and it's double XP this weekend.

24:30.820 --> 24:35.340
And what else did I do?

24:35.340 --> 24:41.220
I've played Wordscapes, I've played Fantasian.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.220
That's really about it.

24:43.140 --> 24:52.980
I picked up Slave Aspire and I bought some PC games, hoping that they would work on the

24:52.980 --> 24:55.700
sale going on right now.

24:55.700 --> 25:07.580
Oh, geez, sorry, I hit the wrong thing and it decided to also not work.

25:08.460 --> 25:18.980
Right now there is so much going on that it's a little bit hard to get everything in line

25:18.980 --> 25:23.780
and get everything going with all the other games that are on my list to play.

25:23.780 --> 25:28.660
I could check my Steam purchase history real quick and tell you what I bought.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.980
Your Steam backlog has been growing.

25:30.980 --> 25:36.420
I've also been buying apps on Steam, like the Discord bot creator.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.140
Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing.

25:38.140 --> 25:43.180
Oh, yeah, there's plenty of good apps on Steam.

25:43.180 --> 25:47.020
I've bought music makers, specifically the Discord app.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.140
I didn't know that was a thing.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.500
I never would have thought to look for that.

25:49.500 --> 25:56.180
But I know they have game engine creator things, some of the big game maker stuff is on Steam.

25:56.180 --> 26:03.740
What I just bought is Tempest 4000 and Yara's Revenge, they're both on sale.

26:03.740 --> 26:11.700
Gorgoa, Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, Discord bot studio, Dimension Drive and Easy Pose for drawing.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.780
I also picked up Kung Fury Street Rage.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.700
Why not?

26:15.700 --> 26:18.300
And I did get Poppy Playtime.

26:18.300 --> 26:22.300
Oh, no, I still need to play that.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.980
So soon, soon, soon.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.140
I also did because it's for Mac.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.580
I got Planescape Torment.

26:29.580 --> 26:32.500
I'm actually thinking about playing it on Steam.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.460
Yeah, cool.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.340
All right, Loki, how about you?

26:36.340 --> 26:37.740
How was your gaming week?

26:37.740 --> 26:40.540
I didn't play a whole ton other than Minecraft.

26:40.540 --> 26:49.540
I did play Minecraft Dungeons, though, because we took the kids to the local skating rink

26:49.540 --> 26:52.060
and they've upgraded all their arcade games.

26:52.060 --> 26:56.620
And so now they have the Minecraft Dungeons arcade game, which is pretty fun.

26:56.620 --> 27:01.340
And what's neat about that one is not only is it, you know, it kind of reminds me a lot

27:01.340 --> 27:07.860
of like the old Gauntlet Legends games, but you get like cards from the game every time

27:07.860 --> 27:08.860
you play it.

27:08.860 --> 27:15.340
And you can use the cards like scan into basically get different armor sets and different like

27:15.340 --> 27:23.660
so you have like a armor set, a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and a familiar.

27:23.660 --> 27:28.180
And so you can scan those in to get different like pets and stuff.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.180
So it's pretty cool.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.220
It's like a collection of cards from playing that.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.220
Hmm.

27:32.220 --> 27:36.940
That sounds like Derby Owners Club or Initial D in the arcade back in the day.

27:36.940 --> 27:37.940
Yeah.

27:37.940 --> 27:38.940
Yeah, a little bit like that.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.820
But yeah, you get cards every time.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.940
And that's been is pretty fun.

27:42.940 --> 27:47.780
So I guess I'll just have to play the actual game that I own first.

27:47.780 --> 27:52.420
I don't know why I'm playing in the arcade when I can just play it at home.

27:52.420 --> 27:57.780
But yeah, I miss I miss Dark Sakura's File of Horses.

27:57.780 --> 28:02.460
She had this big old thing that you unzipped and plop.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.780
It's it was probably for like baseball cards or other types of trading cards.

28:05.780 --> 28:09.500
It was a billfold, like cards tall.

28:09.500 --> 28:13.100
But it was like, let's let me whip out one of my horses and, you know, thumbing through

28:13.100 --> 28:14.100
the pages.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.100
Oh, there's there's Polteri.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.940
There's, you know, and all these horses that she had.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.780
I just cracked me up.

28:19.780 --> 28:24.060
The Derby Owners Club hardcore, though, like all had that all had that it was always funny

28:24.060 --> 28:25.060
to watch.

28:25.060 --> 28:28.580
So I had all those those names.

28:28.580 --> 28:32.340
Pod Culture is mentioning the Injustice arcade game was kind of like that, too, with character

28:32.340 --> 28:33.340
cards.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.340
Interesting.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.340
I guess at least you get something.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.340
Yeah.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.340
Something besides tickets.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.800
I'm not sure this is going to come over on the webcam when we try.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.140
But I got I got my magazine.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.140
Oh, yeah.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.100
The magazine you were featured in over in the UK.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
Congrats on that.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.100
Yes.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.100
Yes.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.100
I got that.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.100
I got a few copies of that.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.100
So we got.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.100
Yeah.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.100
That's sweet.

28:54.140 --> 28:55.140
What did they do?

28:55.140 --> 28:56.140
Did they mention O.L.R.?

28:56.140 --> 28:57.140
No.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.140
And they also never mind.

28:58.140 --> 28:59.140
All right.

28:59.140 --> 29:00.140
No, just kidding.

29:00.140 --> 29:03.780
They took some liberties with trying to figure out what the story of the game was, even though

29:03.780 --> 29:05.780
I did send them a synopsis of it.

29:05.780 --> 29:09.560
So apparently now the game does actually take place in New York.

29:09.560 --> 29:15.820
It is canon now because of the I guess because the first level Central Park, you know, they

29:15.820 --> 29:18.100
assume that, oh, well, let's go to New York.

29:18.100 --> 29:19.100
Yeah.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.100
It must be New York.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.100
And yeah.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.660
So I thought it was kind of funny.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.220
Yeah.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.220
It's.

29:26.220 --> 29:27.220
Yeah.

29:27.220 --> 29:31.820
And they were so confident about it, too, like they're like, you know, the game sees

29:31.820 --> 29:36.620
you take control of a guy who doesn't just like people jogging in his city, New York,

29:36.620 --> 29:37.620
to be precise.

29:37.620 --> 29:38.620
Like, OK.

29:38.620 --> 29:39.620
Oh, wow.

29:39.620 --> 29:40.620
York now.

29:40.620 --> 29:41.620
All right.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.060
I guess somebody else wrote your game.

29:44.060 --> 29:45.060
That's fine.

29:45.060 --> 29:46.060
But yeah, it's cool.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.340
They're just like, oh, an American made it.

29:48.340 --> 29:49.340
It's in New York.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.340
Yeah.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
It's just it's all good.

29:51.340 --> 29:52.340
You know what?

29:52.340 --> 29:53.340
It doesn't matter.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.020
It can be in New York.

29:55.020 --> 29:57.460
It can be in your hometown, whatever you want it to be, whatever you whatever your head

29:57.460 --> 29:58.980
cannon says it is.

29:58.980 --> 29:59.980
Exactly.

29:59.980 --> 30:02.780
You can you can pixel poop wherever you like, of course.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.540
Well, congratulations on the magazine feature.

30:04.540 --> 30:05.540
That's really cool.

30:05.540 --> 30:08.020
And that's that's cool shit magazine over in the UK.

30:08.020 --> 30:12.140
So hopefully folks overseas, I don't know if they can go into like a Barnes and Noble

30:12.140 --> 30:13.140
type thing.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.140
Yeah.

30:14.140 --> 30:15.140
You can.

30:15.140 --> 30:16.140
Yeah, I'm not sure.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.140
I mean, it's a very nice magazine.

30:17.140 --> 30:19.540
I have to say, like, if I actually saw this in the store, like I would definitely pick

30:19.540 --> 30:20.540
it up.

30:20.540 --> 30:21.740
It's like very premium feeling.

30:21.740 --> 30:22.740
Cool.

30:23.140 --> 30:24.140
It's pretty cool.

30:24.140 --> 30:29.180
They've got like reviews of like old toys and like old movies and all sorts of weird

30:29.180 --> 30:30.180
stuff in here.

30:30.180 --> 30:31.460
So it's like really cool.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.780
Are you saying it's full of cool shit?

30:33.780 --> 30:34.780
It is full.

30:34.780 --> 30:35.780
Yes.

30:35.780 --> 30:37.380
All right.

30:37.380 --> 30:41.380
If you want to order that online, if you're in the US or somewhere else, you want to order

30:41.380 --> 30:42.380
that.

30:42.380 --> 30:46.020
Loki did put a link on his Twitter over at Twitter dot com slash Loki O.L.R. if you want

30:46.020 --> 30:50.420
to follow up on that and order yourself some cool shit.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.420
My gaming week.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.540
So like everybody else, you know, the holidays and everything kind of got in the way.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.820
So I haven't played a lot.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.020
I play I've also been doing Dead by Daylight, kind of like our soccer has been trying to

31:00.020 --> 31:01.380
enjoy the double blood point event.

31:01.380 --> 31:06.920
I finally prestiged Cheryl slash James today up to level one.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.540
So I have to start them over.

31:08.540 --> 31:09.580
Why did I prestige?

31:09.580 --> 31:10.580
I don't know.

31:10.580 --> 31:11.580
It's the thing to do, I guess.

31:11.580 --> 31:12.580
So I've been working on that.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.380
I only have two prestigious.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.540
Yeah, I have I have Dwight prestige.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.260
I don't think I have any killers.

31:18.300 --> 31:23.220
So it's something I because I hate how you lose everything, but that's part of it.

31:23.220 --> 31:25.140
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.780
I'm trying to finish up that Moogle tome event because I want that leather jacket.

31:28.780 --> 31:30.300
I've gotten all the mounts I need.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.220
I've gotten the pets, everything else.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.140
But it's that hundred tome leather jacket.

31:34.140 --> 31:39.180
And it's like, oh, the awful grind of having to do Praetorium or something like that over

31:39.180 --> 31:40.660
and over again to get the tomes.

31:40.660 --> 31:45.100
But hey, I'll get there and I will get my leather jacket to complete my look for Endwalker

31:45.100 --> 31:46.260
on Friday.

31:46.260 --> 31:49.340
I hope this doesn't mean the game is down all day Thursday.

31:49.340 --> 31:54.100
They haven't really said or at least I've missed it if there was all day maintenance,

31:54.100 --> 31:56.740
but I'm assuming there has to be before an expansion releases.

31:56.740 --> 32:02.380
So I guess that is going to come quick and fast this this week as we lead up to Friday's

32:02.380 --> 32:04.860
early access for Endwalker.

32:04.860 --> 32:09.580
The other big game I've honestly been playing a lot of this weekend is No Man's Sky, which

32:09.580 --> 32:12.700
I have talked about plenty on this show before.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.700
Why am I back on this bullshit again?

32:14.700 --> 32:19.900
Well, because No Man's Sky announced that they are going to be repeating the different

32:19.900 --> 32:21.160
expeditions.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.580
So these seasonal events, you know, we kind of took to mean seasonal, meaning if you miss

32:26.580 --> 32:30.060
it, you're going to miss it forever and you won't be able to get these rewards again.

32:30.060 --> 32:34.980
Well, it's actually kind of neat because during this kind of slower holiday period between,

32:34.980 --> 32:38.720
you know, from Thanksgiving until New Year's, you know, you have all these holidays going

32:38.720 --> 32:39.720
on.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.900
It is kind of interesting how the team over at Hello Games has just decided, well, let's

32:42.900 --> 32:48.240
repeat the original expeditions for a shorter time so that those that missed them can catch

32:48.240 --> 32:49.240
up on them.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.700
So because I never finished Expedition One, I did two and three.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.940
I didn't do one and four completely.

32:54.940 --> 32:59.260
So I am trying to like put the pedal to the metal, so to speak, and try to finish Expedition

32:59.260 --> 33:01.640
One to get my rewards.

33:01.640 --> 33:05.500
And then I'll be able to sit out two and three while I'm busy playing the Final Fantasy 14

33:05.500 --> 33:12.620
expansion and then move on to Expedition Four when that recaps towards the end of the year.

33:12.620 --> 33:15.220
So I've been playing quite a bit of that trying to finish up Expedition One.

33:15.220 --> 33:20.940
I am further than I was the first time, but they also compressed the expeditions a little

33:20.940 --> 33:21.940
bit.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.440
So they all they start on new planets.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.820
That was the first thing I noticed.

33:24.820 --> 33:28.820
It's not the exact same as it was before.

33:28.820 --> 33:31.260
And they've cut down some of the grinds.

33:31.260 --> 33:36.260
So I remember before, I think you had to do like 10 freighter missions, but now you only

33:36.260 --> 33:37.880
have to do three.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.380
And I think there were some other things that you had to do a lot more of.

33:40.380 --> 33:44.100
Like I think there were 10 artifacts and now again, you only have to do three.

33:44.100 --> 33:47.620
So I think they did cut down a bunch of stuff to fit the two-week timeframe.

33:47.620 --> 33:50.060
But if you're going to get into this because of what I'm saying and I'm letting you know

33:50.060 --> 33:53.400
the expeditions are back and you're like, oh, I want to finish Expedition One too.

33:53.400 --> 33:58.700
You need to start now because you're like today, because there are some things that

33:58.700 --> 34:03.020
you grind that you're not going to get done by Friday if you wait until Thursday to do

34:03.020 --> 34:04.020
it.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.820
Like the three freighter missions is going to be impossible.

34:06.820 --> 34:10.620
You're not going to be able to do three of the five freighter missions because they're

34:10.620 --> 34:12.900
going to be too difficult for your brand new freighter.

34:12.900 --> 34:20.980
So just something to think about and all that as you are going into No Man's Sky.

34:20.980 --> 34:26.500
I'm also really excited because Alan has picked up No Man's Sky again from this.

34:26.500 --> 34:31.320
So he's doing Expedition One right now, although he's playing on Steam and something bugged

34:31.320 --> 34:33.660
out on him that made him really frustrated.

34:33.660 --> 34:38.300
Like he couldn't get the frigate for free that you're supposed to get, so he had to

34:38.300 --> 34:39.300
buy it.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.300
Like really frustrating.

34:40.300 --> 34:44.220
It didn't happen to me on Xbox Series X where I'm playing.

34:44.220 --> 34:50.660
So he's been doing that, but he's really big on now he can do that Normandy mission that

34:50.660 --> 34:54.840
he missed because that was Expedition Two was the one and it was only up for two or

34:54.840 --> 34:56.260
three weeks the first time.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.400
And that's the one that rewarded the Normandy at the end.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.080
Now keep in mind, you don't get to fly the Normandy.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.360
You don't really get to tour the Normandy, you can fly around it and look at it up close

35:06.360 --> 35:08.000
and all that stuff.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
But that's it.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.760
It is just another addition to your fleet that's purely cosmetic.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.080
So it's not going to be suddenly No Man's Mass Effect.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.280
It's just a very simple little artistic crossover.

35:20.280 --> 35:25.600
And they do like Paragon and Renegade titles and other throws to the Mass Effect universe.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.840
That's really it.

35:26.840 --> 35:31.820
But I still think it's cool and as a uber fan of both those games, but I already did

35:31.820 --> 35:32.820
it the first time.

35:32.820 --> 35:36.420
I don't need to do it again, but I'm excited that Alan, who is an uber fan of at least

35:36.420 --> 35:40.440
Mass Effect and trying to get back to No Man's Sky can do both those things now.

35:40.440 --> 35:44.540
So yeah, I will probably stream at some point this week.

35:44.540 --> 35:47.580
I'm going to try and get back into my regular post-work streams.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.580
I have been playing actually a lot of mobile gaming as well still.

35:50.580 --> 35:55.100
I was going pretty hard on Ingress because they were doing double AP, but that is winding

35:55.100 --> 35:57.740
up tomorrow and it's been really good for exercise.

35:57.740 --> 36:01.040
I've been trying to get more exercise lately with everything I've talked about in the prior

36:01.040 --> 36:05.200
weeks on this show and Pikmin actually.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.520
Alan and I went on a walk today in Pikmin and you know, in Pikmin you can plant flowers.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.280
That's kind of the thing that you do.

36:11.280 --> 36:16.640
And we planted blue pansies, both of us, and we walked around the park and we walked around

36:16.640 --> 36:19.640
the bud, the flower bud at the park so many times.

36:19.640 --> 36:25.080
We got it to spawn a blue rose and I haven't even seen that that game has blue roses.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.720
I knew it had red roses.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.920
I'd seen screen caps of that and I saw it in San Francisco.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.080
I have never seen a blue rose in that game anywhere online.

36:32.080 --> 36:37.040
Granted, I don't do a lot of reading on Pikmin Blue, but we got one to spawn here today and

36:37.040 --> 36:38.040
that was really exciting.

36:38.040 --> 36:42.720
So if you're trying to play in that game, get a lot, a lot of pansies planted instead

36:42.720 --> 36:44.320
of the regular flowers.

36:44.320 --> 36:48.480
And I think it increases your chances at spawning a rose and yes, it dropped rose petals.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.760
So I got blue rose petals, but only like a few.

36:51.760 --> 36:56.640
So yeah, so lots of mobile gaming, but that's been very good for exercising too.

36:56.640 --> 37:02.480
I just have to say like you, I know many of you can kind of give or take Pikmin Bloom

37:02.480 --> 37:06.280
and I'm not trying to pretend that the game is like, oh my God, it's the most amazing

37:06.280 --> 37:13.000
thing that's ever happened, but it has gamified exercising and walking for me at a time that

37:13.000 --> 37:14.400
I really needed it.

37:14.400 --> 37:22.480
I got 10,000 steps Friday, Saturday, and I think one other day this week.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.800
So I didn't get it today because I let myself rest a little bit, but I'll probably get 5,000

37:25.840 --> 37:27.960
because I'll probably go on a walk after the show.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.280
So it's been very, very, very good for incentivizing all that.

37:31.280 --> 37:36.560
So thanks to Niantic, who liked my tweet about the blue rose, by the way, Niantic actually

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
liked that.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
I thought that was cute.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.560
Yeah.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
All right.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.560
Let's move on.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.840
We're going to get into some stories for the week again, with it being Thanksgiving in

37:44.840 --> 37:49.040
the US this week, there wasn't a lot of news, but there's still some things going on in

37:49.040 --> 37:51.980
the gaming world we thought we'd bring to the table tonight.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.100
So Loki, why don't you start us off with our first story?

37:55.100 --> 37:57.500
All right.

37:57.500 --> 38:04.260
So let's go ahead and talk about this drama that's going on with Roblox and not necessarily

38:04.260 --> 38:13.700
that Roblox is being sued by a company, especially for, you know, unfair payment of their developers.

38:13.700 --> 38:19.060
But no, this is actually Roblox suing somebody on the platform.

38:19.060 --> 38:25.720
So there's this guy, Ruben Sim, who's been accused of sexual harassment, terrorist threats,

38:25.720 --> 38:29.700
and trying to post pictures of Hitler on there.

38:29.700 --> 38:35.680
Apparently, he has been doing this for a while, it sounds like.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.020
So back in...

38:38.020 --> 38:39.020
He's garbage.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.020
Yeah.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.020
Some of the things he's done.

38:41.020 --> 38:46.140
So he glamorized the April 3rd, 2018 active shooter and murder at YouTube headquarters

38:46.140 --> 38:52.180
and said that something similar should happen to the Roblox headquarters in San Mateo.

38:52.180 --> 38:59.100
He attempted to upload a nude image of himself with only a lampshade covering him.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.680
All sorts of different slurs.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.940
He tried to upload a sex game and upload pictures of Hitler.

39:04.940 --> 39:13.060
So apparently also used his subscribers to try to do other things as well.

39:13.060 --> 39:17.180
So yeah, it's just a piece of trash.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.820
And so now they are suing him for damages.

39:19.820 --> 39:20.820
Good.

39:20.820 --> 39:21.820
TBH.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.820
Good.

39:22.820 --> 39:27.780
Like, you know, I think heading into this, I was kind of like, well, that seems kind

39:27.780 --> 39:29.000
of extreme.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.580
Like you would go and sue a YouTuber that's like playing pranks, but I guess that they're

39:33.580 --> 39:35.000
actually trying to break your game.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.540
But now that you've explained what this individual is doing, and this really sounds like an unwell

39:41.540 --> 39:47.880
individual in many senses, the word good, I'm actually totally team Roblox on this.

39:47.880 --> 39:52.320
I think it's time to start making an example of some of these individuals that literally

39:52.320 --> 39:55.800
think there is no repercussion for these sorts of things.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.960
And also, I'm sorry, there's also another piece to it also.

39:58.960 --> 40:05.880
He also made terrorist threats, basically that called in fake bomb threats to the Roblox

40:05.880 --> 40:07.620
developers conference in San Francisco.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.820
So there's that too.

40:08.820 --> 40:12.800
This person is not well, but it certainly doesn't excuse any of this behavior.

40:12.800 --> 40:16.920
And this person really deserves a wake up call of the highest regard.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.740
And I think this lawsuit is the way to do it.

40:18.740 --> 40:26.500
And quite frankly, for these extreme scenarios, especially, I hope to see more game companies

40:26.500 --> 40:28.380
do it.

40:28.380 --> 40:31.120
Good, good.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
Bring it all out.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.520
Bring out the facts in a court of law, put it on the public record.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.160
Let these people know.

40:37.160 --> 40:43.860
There is accountability somewhere for these actions.

40:43.860 --> 40:48.200
It's what a lot of us have been begging for that stream and do this stuff on Twitch and

40:48.200 --> 40:57.220
so forth when we hear about marginalized creators, whether it be black people, brown people,

40:57.220 --> 41:02.840
different religious people streaming, whether it be gay, lesbian, transgender, non-binary,

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
you name it.

41:03.840 --> 41:08.200
All these marginalized groups on Twitch, they all get targeted with swatting.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.740
Women get targeted with swatting.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.840
It's disgusting.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.560
And we've been begging for accountability for these individuals.

41:15.560 --> 41:20.680
The best news that ever happened was when Twitch sued the two people that were apparently

41:20.680 --> 41:23.400
behind the Haas stuff, right?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.720
Some time ago or something along those lines.

41:25.720 --> 41:26.720
Hooray!

41:26.720 --> 41:27.720
That was long overdue.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.720
Hooray.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
Yes.

41:29.720 --> 41:36.080
It sucks that, like, you know, it's having to be handled in a civil courtroom as opposed

41:36.080 --> 41:38.480
to a criminal one where it ought to be handled.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.880
Some of these swatting incidents.

41:39.880 --> 41:45.880
Well, and this guy's still got his channel of 700,000 subscribers on YouTube.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.040
He's still platformed on YouTube because apparently they think this is OK.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.040
I don't know.

41:51.040 --> 41:55.940
Who the fuck would subscribe to something like I.

41:55.940 --> 42:02.260
The fact that 700,000 people subscribe to that, I'm going to write off that there are

42:02.260 --> 42:07.300
bot accounts of which there's usually many tied to something, but even still, even if

42:07.300 --> 42:13.660
you have that and assume that 300,000 of them are real, that is far too many people.

42:13.660 --> 42:22.940
And that's that says a lot about why society feels really broken sometimes.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.980
And I don't know what else to say about that all the time.

42:25.020 --> 42:26.020
I know.

42:26.020 --> 42:29.580
I don't know what else to say about that on my little video game podcast with my friends.

42:29.580 --> 42:37.540
Like I but just just marinate in that for a minute, 750,000 accounts, half of which

42:37.540 --> 42:41.060
sure are probably bots and, you know, throwaways.

42:41.060 --> 42:47.460
But at least half of that are following this person's content and essentially encouraging

42:47.460 --> 42:54.460
and egging that on nude pictures, pictures of Hitler in a children's game.

42:54.940 --> 43:03.100
Hmm. I don't know, I'm disgusted, too, and that's why I'm I'm actually kind of glad to

43:03.100 --> 43:08.740
see Roblox suing them, throw the it should be a criminal trial, quite frankly.

43:08.740 --> 43:14.060
It shouldn't be a civil trial, but you know how it goes sometimes with a criminal or the

43:14.060 --> 43:16.380
criminal court won't do it.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.940
Civil court will do it.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.860
So anyway, yeah.

43:19.860 --> 43:24.580
And I see a lot of folks in chat, Mike Deaf saying seven hundred thousand subs, the fuck.

43:24.580 --> 43:26.620
Yeah, my reaction exactly.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.340
I see seven hundred seventy four now, but.

43:30.540 --> 43:34.100
Well, because of all the coverage this is getting, it's actually probably encouraging

43:34.100 --> 43:38.900
more people with with such wonderful hits as swearing at Roblox admins with voice chat,

43:38.900 --> 43:42.340
that that's one of his higher ranking videos of of late.

43:43.980 --> 43:48.100
Just. Yeah, he's just constantly harassing people online.

43:48.220 --> 43:54.260
Whatever happened to calling most tavern and asking for Mike last name hunt, whatever happened

43:54.260 --> 43:58.260
to that, that is silly, ridiculous.

43:58.660 --> 44:05.260
And the pain, you know, there's no you know, it goes away in 15 seconds.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.580
It's a stupid fucking prank.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.180
What? And then you're done.

44:09.620 --> 44:13.780
What Loki's describing here is not a stupid fucking prank.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.820
This is like like if you think about it.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.020
Is psychological damage on children.

44:19.740 --> 44:24.020
It is. It's disgusting and there's no excuse for it.

44:24.460 --> 44:25.460
Absolutely not.

44:27.140 --> 44:31.780
Fifth dream in chat with it, fifth dream in chat with a decent point, actually saying

44:31.780 --> 44:38.580
caller ID happened, you know, and I realized the concept of Internet ID would be

44:38.580 --> 44:42.620
controversial and I'm not even sure I am completely in favor of something like that.

44:42.620 --> 44:47.860
However, there has to be some sort of accountability for people like this and for

44:47.860 --> 44:52.620
people that are phoning in false SWAT reports and things of that nature.

44:52.780 --> 44:54.260
Where's the accountability?

44:54.260 --> 44:59.780
It's not until I and so I applaud Roblox for starting, even though I think it's a

44:59.780 --> 45:03.260
ridiculous game and platform, but it's for kids, whatever.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.220
It's not for me. I'm not the audience.

45:05.420 --> 45:12.020
Fine. I applaud Roblox and thank them for taking this person to court and getting it

45:12.020 --> 45:16.820
out in the open and putting it on public record, because that's where this has to be

45:16.820 --> 45:17.980
solved, unfortunately.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.740
Gross. Just so disgusted.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.980
SSJ 100 Matt says he's doing it for the subs.

45:24.300 --> 45:28.740
Whatever YouTube revenue he thought he was going to get is going to Roblox.

45:28.900 --> 45:34.140
And quite honestly, I hope Roblox in turn donates it to a children's charity to try to

45:34.140 --> 45:37.500
undo some of the damage this guy is doing, although I'm not going to put that pressure

45:37.500 --> 45:41.940
on Roblox because they probably have to pay more admins and so forth to deal with

45:41.940 --> 45:44.580
this bullshit. And that is understandable.

45:44.580 --> 45:49.940
But E3VL in chat says, isn't there a two digit number you can press to be unknown caller

45:49.940 --> 45:52.300
ID? I remember someone doing that in high school.

45:52.300 --> 45:56.420
There is. But my understanding is it's still like it's really easy to trace calls now.

45:56.540 --> 46:02.860
Like that's why a lot of the phone pranking like stopped, like that is because even though

46:02.860 --> 46:07.180
you can block caller ID, it is very easy to get the phone records and figure out who's

46:07.180 --> 46:08.980
doing it and have that complaint or whatever.

46:09.300 --> 46:14.220
Uh, your overrated face in chat, welcome, by the way, I think that's a new name, says

46:14.220 --> 46:15.340
Star 66.

46:15.340 --> 46:18.100
Yeah, I thought it was I actually thought it was Star 69.

46:18.260 --> 46:21.220
Nice. I think Star 69 is the call back.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.420
Yeah. Oh, that was OK.

46:22.420 --> 46:27.500
Nice. But like Star 70 or something was the I know it was probably different on every

46:27.500 --> 46:28.940
phone company and what have you.

46:28.940 --> 46:34.460
So anyway. Yeah, folks, it just folks in chat are lighting at 62, 62, just depending on

46:34.460 --> 46:38.220
where you live. Anyway, fuck this guy especially.

46:38.260 --> 46:43.420
And fuck people that are doing these these pranks that are way over the line again,

46:44.140 --> 46:45.700
memeing and dead by daylight.

46:46.940 --> 46:48.420
Is your refrigerator running?

46:48.900 --> 46:53.460
That's one thing, these things that this guy's doing completely another and for the

46:53.460 --> 46:54.460
money and the YouTube.

46:54.580 --> 46:57.860
Yeah, I also think it's a problem that YouTube is not shutting this person down.

46:57.860 --> 47:02.460
Gross. But I guess let's make money off those seven hundred thousand accounts and

47:02.460 --> 47:05.020
donate it to children. That would be a lovely resolution.

47:06.020 --> 47:13.660
Yeah. Meanwhile, let's talk about what could have been, but what is not in less

47:13.660 --> 47:18.820
serious news, this is something that could have been for a video game series, but is

47:18.820 --> 47:21.020
not. And that is Mortal Kombat.

47:21.340 --> 47:28.940
And apparently it was rumored that Keanu Reeves was supposed to make an appearance in

47:28.940 --> 47:33.980
Mortal Kombat at some point, whether Neo from The Matrix or John Wick or whatever

47:33.980 --> 47:39.340
happened. This was answered in a fan video with Esquire to talk about The Matrix for

47:39.780 --> 47:41.740
somebody had asked this whole thing.

47:41.740 --> 47:46.980
And Keanu said, if it was up to me, no, Mortal Kombat is awesome in so many ways.

47:46.980 --> 47:50.700
But I think, you know, Neo, John Wick, yeah, man, they're doing their own thing.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.740
Mortal Kombat's doing their own thing.

47:52.780 --> 47:57.420
So people are kind of having that fantasy because it is Warner Brothers that

47:57.540 --> 47:59.300
essentially owns both the license.

47:59.300 --> 48:00.620
So it would be easy, I suppose.

48:00.860 --> 48:04.420
But of course, you have to get the likeness of the actor less easy.

48:04.420 --> 48:08.180
And there's also nothing out there that actually says this was ever in discussion.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.420
It's probably just one of those rumors that was out there or what have you or, you know,

48:11.420 --> 48:14.380
somebody took wouldn't this be cool to something further?

48:14.660 --> 48:18.260
But I can also like I can understand, you know, Mortal Kombat 10, 11.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.540
They are some pretty violent games.

48:20.540 --> 48:26.260
And like if you're Keanu Reeves, do you want to really see Scorpion cutting your head off

48:26.260 --> 48:30.020
and setting you on fire and peeing on you and whatever else they do?

48:30.180 --> 48:31.980
In that case, do you really want to see that happen?

48:31.980 --> 48:34.380
Your likeness? Probably not.

48:34.980 --> 48:41.340
So I, I understand why there are many actors and actresses who would probably say, you

48:41.340 --> 48:44.700
know, I think we'll pass on this one for this.

48:45.020 --> 48:51.060
Now, you know, there were some characters like Freddy, Jason didn't like Freddy showed

48:51.060 --> 48:52.420
up in Mortal Kombat nine.

48:52.420 --> 48:57.860
Right. And then, yeah, like the predator is in one of like a lot of silly movie

48:57.860 --> 49:03.340
characters are in them, but they're usually masked or they don't like look like the

49:03.340 --> 49:04.580
actor or anything like that.

49:05.420 --> 49:09.420
They don't let them like when it was Joker, they didn't let him shoot somebody.

49:10.340 --> 49:14.420
That was probably the arrangement with DC Comics in that particular game, because that's

49:14.420 --> 49:16.300
why they had the whole brutality thing.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.420
And it wasn't like there were no fatalities.

49:19.140 --> 49:21.900
Yeah, nobody wants to see Wonder Woman get decapitated.

49:21.900 --> 49:25.140
That would be disgusting. So like it wouldn't have fit in that universe, you know.

49:25.420 --> 49:28.740
So I think that's why the brutalities were a little better.

49:28.740 --> 49:32.020
And at least, you know, with the Joker thing, it kind of went off camera.

49:32.020 --> 49:35.220
So you never really knew, like, was it a joke?

49:35.220 --> 49:37.020
Who knows? So anyway.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.460
Yeah, let's see.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.860
Some folks in chat are still talking about the prank stuff and the callback stuff.

49:46.100 --> 49:51.460
E3VL is saying at least two times a week, someone wants to know about my car's extended

49:51.460 --> 49:53.420
warranty. Oh, my God.

49:53.660 --> 49:57.740
That is those those calls are out of control, as are the spam texts.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.460
I get them. I kid you not.

49:59.460 --> 50:01.140
Every day, every day.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.260
OK, if you reply stop.

50:04.180 --> 50:09.420
But then they know they know somebody's looking, I forward them to the thing, Rob.

50:10.100 --> 50:17.580
They are legally required if you say stop to stop all further communications, it's like a

50:17.580 --> 50:18.420
do not call list.

50:18.420 --> 50:19.820
Where do I report that if they don't?

50:20.460 --> 50:22.620
I'm serious because I'm so sick of these texts.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.740
That would be the the FCC.

50:27.140 --> 50:32.020
I've been forwarding them all to the AT&T has a number maybe folks don't know this, but

50:32.020 --> 50:33.380
this is unique to AT&T.

50:33.380 --> 50:37.540
I don't other carriers probably have a similar thing, but AT&T has seventy seven twenty

50:37.540 --> 50:41.700
six, which is if you spell spam, you forward the message and then it says, thanks for

50:41.700 --> 50:43.540
reporting this. What number did you get it from?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.780
And then it says, thanks. We'll look into it.

50:45.860 --> 50:50.260
Of course, nothing's happened, but I liked I like to feel like if I reported enough times,

50:50.260 --> 50:51.180
something will happen.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.940
So, well, sadly, that's not quite the case.

50:55.100 --> 50:56.140
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

50:56.620 --> 51:00.660
TigerCon chats is the problem with the spam calls that they are mostly recordings and you

51:00.660 --> 51:02.500
hear those same recordings in different numbers.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.740
Yeah, it's oof, oof, oof.

51:04.740 --> 51:08.540
Whatever happened to that do not call list and all that, like make that shit go away.

51:09.820 --> 51:17.180
The thing is, is that the do not call list tends to go, if I if I remember correctly, I

51:17.180 --> 51:19.700
think it only applies to.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.940
Like U.S.

51:24.340 --> 51:25.940
telemarketing calls are for U.S.

51:25.940 --> 51:29.260
companies. Oh, sure, because they can't legislate what happens elsewhere in the world, of

51:29.260 --> 51:33.740
course, makes sense. Yeah, but with a lot of those, too, though, if you get those

51:33.740 --> 51:39.940
marketing calls, if you listen long enough, they'll give you the do the opt out one and

51:39.940 --> 51:44.700
they do remove you from their lists because I don't get them as much since I just waited

51:44.700 --> 51:46.500
them out. Interesting.

51:46.580 --> 51:50.140
And I was hanging up. Yeah, it is it is it is full on required.

51:50.140 --> 51:54.340
I'm about to turn that thing on on my phone where it just simply doesn't ring if I don't

51:54.340 --> 51:56.060
have the person listed as a contact.

51:56.300 --> 52:01.340
Like I I used to have a Pixel phone and they used to have that.

52:01.620 --> 52:07.220
I don't know why it's not just any Android phone, but they used to have it where Google

52:07.220 --> 52:11.500
actually answer your phone for you to have like a robot, not really robot voice, but it's

52:11.500 --> 52:16.460
like an AI voice that it's it screens your call for you and then it does like a voice

52:16.460 --> 52:19.780
attacks to what the person's saying.

52:19.780 --> 52:23.820
And so I used to do that all the time on my old phone and I got a new phone that

52:24.060 --> 52:26.620
unfortunately wasn't a pixel because they didn't have them at the time.

52:26.620 --> 52:30.900
And now it doesn't do that. And it's I miss that so much, but interesting.

52:30.900 --> 52:35.740
Really wish that was something that they offered on other non pixel devices.

52:36.220 --> 52:37.420
Interesting. All right.

52:37.420 --> 52:42.660
Good to know. From Keanu Reeves to spam telephone calls, just another episode of Orange

52:42.660 --> 52:46.980
Launch Radio. All right, let's move on to something I'm sure we're going to be slightly

52:46.980 --> 52:48.740
passionate about. I don't know, dark soccer.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.460
What do you think of this next one?

52:50.460 --> 52:51.700
I'm pretty excited.

52:51.700 --> 52:55.540
OK, I want to I want to believe I want to believe that's a good way to put I want to

52:55.540 --> 53:02.260
believe. So there was supposed to have been a Mass Effect movie and it was canceled

53:02.260 --> 53:04.260
because legendary pictures backed out of it.

53:04.860 --> 53:11.740
You know, and basically Bioware was like, you know, we're we weren't going to be able to

53:11.740 --> 53:14.540
tell the story in 90 to 120 minutes.

53:15.060 --> 53:22.020
So basically now they are nearing a deal with Amazon to do a Mass Effect TV series,

53:22.540 --> 53:26.340
which is pretty good because it's going to be coming on on the tail end of the expanse if

53:26.340 --> 53:32.820
it happens. So it'll cover their sci fi gap once that other show is gone.

53:33.140 --> 53:39.900
And I mean, hopefully it's going to be set in the prime universe and not the the Andromeda

53:39.900 --> 53:44.700
universe. Or if they do anything, it might be some other new story, but at least we're

53:44.700 --> 53:46.940
going to be getting some more Mass Effect from what it looks like.

53:46.940 --> 53:47.900
I think it'll be awesome.

53:48.660 --> 53:52.940
I I'm certainly on board with a Mass Effect TV series, but tell me what you think about

53:52.940 --> 53:55.180
this dark soccer, because this might be the controversial point.

53:55.500 --> 53:58.340
I really do not want them to do Shepard.

53:58.620 --> 54:03.700
I think they would be I think they would be getting into some real dangerous territory if

54:03.700 --> 54:08.420
they could. Number one, whoever they cast, the people that played the opposite gender

54:08.420 --> 54:13.020
Shepard are going to be pissed like there is no there is no pleasing the fandom now.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.180
They could we need a non-binary Shepard.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.260
Fine. That's all.

54:17.780 --> 54:21.500
Well, I mean, you also have Liara technically a non-binary race, but yes, fine.

54:21.500 --> 54:28.180
Yes, of course. All that. However, I am fine with something parallel in that

54:28.220 --> 54:31.900
same sort of like because I think it would actually be really cool if there was a

54:31.900 --> 54:35.900
parallel story that wasn't Shepard, but somebody else.

54:36.060 --> 54:41.780
And then that way you could have some of the other characters cross over like Liara

54:41.780 --> 54:45.260
actually would be a great example, especially considering her lifespan.

54:45.540 --> 54:49.780
You could you know, it could be a little bit after we get four, but we could have our

54:49.780 --> 54:55.300
just a car. I mean, because I'm sure she she goes out in the makeup all the time.

54:55.300 --> 54:56.540
I'm sure she'd happily do it.

54:56.620 --> 55:00.460
Yeah, I think maybe a prequel would be all right, too.

55:00.460 --> 55:05.020
But I just I just I just don't want them to try to tell the Shepard story in a TV

55:05.020 --> 55:08.780
series. But I think there's ways they could do it where they could kind of go around

55:08.780 --> 55:11.540
the Shepard thing and still do something very satisfying.

55:11.940 --> 55:13.700
So I think so. Yeah.

55:14.780 --> 55:18.340
And if you had a prequel, you could do something with both Kayden and Ashley to

55:18.340 --> 55:22.700
not, you know, piss people and spoiler alert for a years old game.

55:22.940 --> 55:26.300
But you could do something that, you know, would would please fans of both those

55:26.300 --> 55:30.580
people. I just think maybe either a slight prequel like just before Shepard or

55:30.580 --> 55:33.940
something excuse me, hiccups parallel would be perfect.

55:34.420 --> 55:38.300
Or what if you have something about like a different side character, like maybe about

55:38.300 --> 55:42.180
Vega? Oh, I love that idea.

55:43.100 --> 55:47.460
Go be a writer for the show. I love that idea, because then, yes, a parallel character

55:47.460 --> 55:52.460
who then intersects with everybody towards the climax of the

55:52.700 --> 55:54.580
story. I think that's a great idea.

55:55.220 --> 55:58.820
So, yeah, because, I mean, he seemed to have had an interesting life and, you know, he

55:58.820 --> 56:03.260
was trying to get into, you know, the N7 program and all that.

56:03.260 --> 56:04.460
I think it would be pretty neat.

56:05.940 --> 56:10.420
Tyron College, actually, didn't they do an animated thing about Vega?

56:10.460 --> 56:12.700
Yes, they did. And I have it and it was great.

56:12.860 --> 56:14.260
Yeah. All right.

56:14.260 --> 56:15.260
Now you're on to something.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.660
They got, you know, Freddie Prinze Jr.

56:17.660 --> 56:20.460
to do all the vocalizations.

56:21.460 --> 56:26.460
I would say maybe he could play Vega, but I guess he's he's kind of he's older than we are.

56:26.460 --> 56:28.060
He's not the right build. Yeah, he's not.

56:28.060 --> 56:29.740
He's nice getting a little older, too.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.940
I think he's dad bought it out a little bit, too.

56:31.980 --> 56:32.980
Yeah, yeah.

56:33.780 --> 56:35.260
Vega's built like a tank.

56:35.660 --> 56:40.460
Tyron Chad over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says Mass Effect as a TV show makes

56:40.460 --> 56:43.420
sense because it's such a huge universe with a ton of world building.

56:43.580 --> 56:47.020
And for a show like this to work, they could just have a new character that you follow.

56:47.140 --> 56:49.580
And this character could be a new recruit in the Normandy.

56:49.780 --> 56:53.620
You could tell the stories from the game, from another character's point of view.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.900
I think that's the way to do it.

56:55.900 --> 56:58.380
Tell the stories from another character's point of view.

56:58.500 --> 57:03.020
And then you can see all the same types of places like the Citadel absolutely has to be it.

57:03.860 --> 57:09.740
It would have to not be, though, anything with the Normandy or Shepard specifically.

57:09.780 --> 57:17.660
Yeah, but there's there's a lot of gaps you could fill, like a lot happens between one and two.

57:17.820 --> 57:23.420
Why not set a TV show to help explain the events of what happens between one and two when

57:23.420 --> 57:25.260
Shepard is out of commission, so to speak?

57:26.180 --> 57:32.060
You know, I've already had like stuff written in the background, you know, so they should just

57:32.060 --> 57:34.260
totally they should hire me to write for them.

57:34.780 --> 57:37.140
I'd be good. I would I would love to.

57:37.180 --> 57:40.380
So I just I do not want them better than writing fan fiction.

57:41.220 --> 57:44.420
If they cast I write a treatment, they script it.

57:45.100 --> 57:50.900
If they cast John or Jane Shepard or whatever the default names are, if they cast those if they

57:50.900 --> 57:54.740
cast a John or a Jane Shepard, I'm I'm going to be really upset.

57:54.900 --> 57:58.620
I don't want them to try to tell that exact same story.

57:58.820 --> 58:04.340
But so all these ideas about a side universe, a side story, a tangential thing are great.

58:05.140 --> 58:09.980
What if they did do something like a.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.180
Andromeda ish.

58:12.180 --> 58:19.620
I'd be I'd actually be really super OK with an Andromeda ish story, even if it's not like

58:19.620 --> 58:23.700
those care, finally give us the story of the Korean arc, although that would be a really

58:23.700 --> 58:25.140
weird place to start a TV series.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.580
I think they did that book, didn't they?

58:26.580 --> 58:29.340
Yeah, they did. You're right. But I get that book.

58:29.340 --> 58:36.020
The idea of maybe another universe, another galaxy in that same thing, you it would basically

58:36.020 --> 58:37.220
be Star Trek, Voyager.

58:37.220 --> 58:41.660
And I'm totally OK with that, like, but with Mass Effect, people would be amazing, I think.

58:42.660 --> 58:46.020
Or what about post-war?

58:47.460 --> 58:50.900
Yeah, and they they get the mass relays working.

58:52.260 --> 58:57.100
Or a group gets thrown out with, you know, if you're going to take the whole Voyager

58:57.100 --> 59:01.380
thing, a ship gets thrown out via mass relay at the end of everything.

59:02.180 --> 59:07.540
Any of these ideas I am more than OK with, just please do not write fanfiction.

59:07.540 --> 59:08.820
I have ideas. I know.

59:08.820 --> 59:11.980
I know. Please do not tell the stories of the games.

59:13.180 --> 59:17.980
If they tried to retell Andromeda story, I wouldn't be as mad, but I just that would be

59:17.980 --> 59:19.420
such a weird place for them to start.

59:20.060 --> 59:24.860
It would just remove the whole thing that the game is choice.

59:24.860 --> 59:30.300
I think they have to start with a prequel or something between one and two because they

59:30.300 --> 59:31.900
have to establish the story.

59:31.900 --> 59:34.780
There's going to be people that watch this that have never played the games.

59:35.580 --> 59:38.300
I really don't think they're going to be able to just pick it up in the middle.

59:39.340 --> 59:40.140
So we'll see.

59:40.700 --> 59:48.380
Anyway, oh, I don't hate this idea from Tiger Claw, a Deep Space Nine type of show taking

59:48.380 --> 59:49.620
place in the Citadel.

59:50.060 --> 59:53.580
I don't hate. Yeah, the Citadel had a lot of great stories with it.

59:53.740 --> 59:58.220
And there's a lot of really interesting kind of relationships and things that I and there

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.540
could be interludes at this one's intimate apparel.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.580
Yeah, you can go you can go right for them to.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.860
Yeah, I'm you know about that, right?

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.300
Oh, of course, I found that on my fly cam.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.740
Yeah, yeah, this one's intimate apparel.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.740
I'm Hannah Lingerie shop.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.100
I'm sure somebody put it in as a joke thinking nobody would find it.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.100
And then people find shit.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.220
People find it, of course.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.540
All right, let's move on.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.820
More stories to tell while we await the casting of Shepard and get very disappointed.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.340
But we're going to hold out hope.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:37.780
Meanwhile, Loki, what's on our next story now for a different type of disappointment?

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:42.340
So and now something completely different.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:48.900
Nintendo has now commented on the whole Activision harassment stories, basically saying that

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.900
they are distressing and disturbing.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:56.500
You know, Doug Bowser said addressing the whole thing.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.580
Along with all of you, I've been following the latest developments with Activision Blizzard

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.660
and the ongoing reports of sexual harassment and toxicity at the company.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.460
I find all of these accounts distressing and disturbing.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.340
They run counter to my values as well as the Nintendo's police values and policies.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.940
I mean, yeah, it's pretty basic.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:22.340
Still, really get more still, Loki, you know, you fucked up when Bowser's looking at you

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:24.740
going, man, that's pretty fucked up.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:32.820
Yeah, so and then to kind of respond to all of these things, Activision Blizzard is forming

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:39.060
a workplace responsibility committee that are led by two of the current members of their

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.460
board.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:44.820
The committee will require management to develop key performance indicators and other means

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.460
of measure progress and ensure accountability.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:52.580
The chief executive officer, Bobby Kotick, along with the chief people officer and chief

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.580
compliance officer, will provide frequent progress reports to the committee.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.020
The committee will be investigating themselves, apparently.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.340
So literally.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.300
The worst solution possible.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.860
We've investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.860
Bobby Kotick's firing is long overdue.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.500
Pass it on.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.700
Like, that's that's I, I am thankful in all seriousness with my Bowser comment.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.260
I'm very thankful to Doug Bowser for speaking up.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:25.380
I'm thankful to all of the game companies for speaking up because that is going to really

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.980
put that pressure on Activision.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:30.340
I we've been doing this shit for 19 years.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.900
I I can't recall a time.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.940
Granted, I couldn't remember who harmonics really was earlier in the show.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:45.140
However, I cannot recall a time when Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all come together

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.860
to say this is an issue.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:50.900
Yeah.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.220
Yesh.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.740
Uh, Mike Defton chat says that's what happened in riot.

01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:59.140
Oh, yeah.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:03.540
The establishing the committee that's made up of the people that need to have oversight.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.140
Yeah, it's just boy.

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.580
Uh, E3VL in chat says we just need Steam and Valve to get on board.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.620
You know, I didn't even think about that because I was really honed in on the console.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.100
But you're right.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.060
Activision games are sold on the Steam platform.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.700
So it would be nice for Steam to make a comment.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:24.500
However, at this point, just simply all three console manufacturers identifying that there

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:31.380
is a problem, I'm I'm very glad to those executives for stepping up and saying what needed to

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.580
be said publicly when it is a business risk.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.220
Let's be real.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.980
It is a business risk.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.940
Anyway, Bobby Kotick's resignation is long overdue.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.300
Let's all hope tomorrow's the day.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.100
Meanwhile, I hope by the time you all hear this podcast, he's gone.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.300
I really, really do, because I would like to talk about that company's products again.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.820
But meanwhile, we'll talk about Atari.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.100
How about we talk about Atari instead?

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.980
Well, you know, Atari, Atari's done some interesting things.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.460
Well, and also Atari isn't Atari anymore.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:07.220
You know what Infogrames bought Atari some years ago and Atari's Atari's done some cool

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.740
things, I guess, like the hotel.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.700
I actually think is very interesting, although I've yet to really see one.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.300
But I find that interesting.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.860
And Atari's done some things that are not so interesting, like the VCS that oof, oof,

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.360
oof.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.060
Well, yeah, it sounded cool at the beginning, and then it just got less interesting as it

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.540
went on.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.460
Yeah, well, Atari's made some very interesting moves this week.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.260
Atari is purchasing Moby Games.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.780
It's going for 1.5 million and I guess they're going to be taking over what early next year

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.820
or something like that.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:42.660
Moby Games is a site that I guess if you want to sum it up, it's kind of like an IMDB for

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:45.380
games has a lot of that sort of stuff.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:51.940
And actually, ironically, one thing I noticed is that Moby does document the older games

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.260
of the Atari 2600 era in television, Commodore.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.180
It documents a lot of that stuff pretty well.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:03.540
Like I will try to find obscure Commodore 64 games that maybe there's a YouTube or two

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.140
because, you know, there's a lot on YouTube now.

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.620
But literally the only websites that have information is like Moby Games.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.700
So they do have a pretty impressive database.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.500
And I guess I see where that's to Atari's benefit because Atari is a retro company as

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.140
well.

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:22.260
And perhaps this is something that's a tie in to what we talked about last week or the

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:28.020
week before where Atari is doing the limited running game.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.340
I just want to say limited run games, but that's another company.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.460
But y'all know what I mean.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.500
They're doing that kind of like limited publishing thing on their side.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.300
I could see why maybe they want to tie it into this.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:43.380
Of course, if I'm a Moby Games super user of which that site is very user driven, it's

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:48.980
Wikipedia-esque in that regard, I can see where I'm kind of freaked out by this idea

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:55.460
because this already happened to them before when Gamefly bought them at one point, changed

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.060
everything, and then Blue Flame Labs bought them and changed it back.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.820
So if I am somebody who spent many volunteer hours helping to keep Moby Games be a great

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.620
website, I'm concerned about this sale.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.820
And I get this a little bit.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.380
Quest Buster in chat says Moby Games is such a great resource.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.620
I found a lot of esoteric games there.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:20.420
There's also Atari Age out there, which focuses exclusively on Atari releases, trading and

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:20.980
preservation.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.460
But as far as I know, the new Atari doesn't own them.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:29.380
Bobby Blackwolf wants to point out, I have a Moby Games profile for my one game credit.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.220
Somebody made a Moby Games for Flappy Vogue?

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.540
I'm just kidding.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:40.740
Bobby did a soundtrack for a Tetris flavored game in the 90s, so you can find more out

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.100
about that on his show, which I've never played, oddly enough.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.300
I want to stream it sometime.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.820
It probably doesn't even run on modern PCs without, like, DOSBox or something.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:54.100
SSG100 Matt does point out no pixel poops on Moby Games.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.660
Matt, it's a user-driven site.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.180
Somebody just has to add it.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.060
Loki, where are you at?

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:04.420
Didn't you add it somewhere else so it could get scooped up by...

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.700
It's on the game database.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.500
That's tied with Twitch.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.900
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.180
Game database for Twitch.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.460
So, all right.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.140
That's actually not where things end.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:24.260
Atari has also mentioned they've invested half a million in the streaming retro platform

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.300
AntStream.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.140
I've talked about AntStream on this program.

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.820
I used to be a subscriber.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.900
I was a backer of the Kickstarter.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.340
I actually no longer am.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.580
I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.820
It's not really shade against AntStream.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.780
I'm going to explain why in a minute.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.580
In the quote, Atari says,

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:45.140
the investment in AntStream Limited was made pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:49.620
can be converted into equity of AntStream Limited in a future financing with an initial

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.300
investment of $500,000.

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.940
This is not the first time Atari and AntStream have partnered up.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:02.900
AntStream is one of the few things that's actually on the VCS where I believe a much

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:10.420
larger Atari library is playable on AntStream if you are streaming it from an Atari VCS.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:16.340
If you are not and you're on the PC platform, you have a very limited amount of Atari games

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.340
and they add maybe one a week, but sometimes they're deep cuts.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.220
So it's been a little slow to catch up.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180
So I mentioned I used to be on AntStream.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.380
Why did I stop?

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.300
Quite simply, they mysteriously stopped supporting Xbox.

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:35.540
There is a client for Xbox One that exists.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.940
There is no client for Xbox Series X.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.980
I have been a fan of AntStream as far as like, you know, I think the cloud-based stuff for

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.020
retro gaming and I do want to support it from a legal perspective.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.980
I think it's interesting.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.820
I actually kind of liked that it's a European-based company.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.540
So a lot of stuff is from a European perspective.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.220
There's a very heavy MSX.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.180
I'm sorry, not MSX.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.380
The other one, ZX Spectrum.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.340
The other one you couldn't get here.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.820
ZX Spectrum is very heavily on AntStream, which makes sense.

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.540
And a lot of Commodore classics, which you know I love.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.860
I don't even think you can get on.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.300
Chat, correct me if I'm wrong, but for a long time you couldn't even get on AntStream if

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.940
you were in the US.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.620
You had to be a Kickstarter backer, right?

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.780
But maybe they, Dark Tetsuya said ever since they went free to play, he was able to get

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:21.940
on it.

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.220
So maybe that changed.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:23.540
Sorry.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.780
But yeah, that's why I stopped with AntStream.

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.380
Like the PC thing is cool, I guess, but I want to be able to play on my Xbox.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.100
And I thought it was really weird because when the Kickstarter happened, they said they

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.460
were going to do PlayStation.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.620
They had a stretch goal for PlayStation.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.940
I want to say they had a stretch goal for Switch too.

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.900
I might be wrong.

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.580
It's been a few years since I backed it.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.660
And the Xbox as well is supposed to be a thing.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:56.020
And as far as I'm concerned, as long as they continue to work on these Atari clients and

01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:00.740
they're not delivering on these earlier promises, they're in violation of that Kickstarter

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.260
agreement as far as I'm concerned.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.740
And that's why I have no longer extended my subscription with them.

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:12.420
But that aside, I do mostly have positive things to say about the platform.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.100
I want to see it succeed.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.500
I have concerns if it will under Atari's watch, but Atari didn't buy them.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.980
It just looks like Atari's got a lot of money in them.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.740
But so, yeah.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.540
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that was my tweet.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.820
Yeah, I'm actually digging the vast arcade library and the leaderboards and challenges

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.380
are fun too.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:34.580
Pistol pockets in chat says, from what I know, Anstream actually owns Moby Games now, which

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.540
is why Atari may use the option to purchase Moby Games.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.300
I'm not sure where that comes from.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.140
I believe Blue Flames, something it's called, is the one that owns Moby Games.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.220
I think this is just this particular press release getting jumbled a little bit.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.940
I think, and I could, again, I didn't remember who Harmonics was at the beginning of the

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.100
show, so it's very possible I'm in the wrong.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:59.540
But I am looking at an article that says the current owner is Blue Flame Labs.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.740
So just for the record.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.740
Oh, oh, OK.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.220
Thank you.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.980
Pixel pockets is clarifying.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:13.140
Blue Flame Labs LLC closed a year ago and Moby Games Limited was created with owners

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.580
from Anstream.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.220
I was confused as well and looked into it and asked people on the Moby Games Discord.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:25.620
Oh, well, thank you, because that clearly is research I did not do.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.300
And that explains a lot.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.820
So, huh, that is fascinating.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:38.340
Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, I can only hope that Atari leaves Moby Games as is, as

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.140
last time one of the buyers redesigned the site years ago.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.180
Yeah, I think it was Gamefly.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.620
It actually destroyed a lot of its ease of use before it was reverted back under new

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.420
owners.

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.060
That is really interesting what Pixel pockets said, huh?

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.500
Why would Anstream want Moby Games?

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.740
Unless, you know what?

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.980
I'm going to just fire a crazy idea out there.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:08.740
What if the idea with Moby Games is to make it so that you look up the old games and then

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.860
you play it right there on your browser with Anstream technology?

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.460
I think that's the future right there.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.260
But again, I'm still waiting on my PlayStation and Xbox clients.

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:20.820
I was promised.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.100
All right, let's move on.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.780
More retro goodness, right, DarkSakura?

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.780
Yep, we have some goodies from Taito.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:36.020
The Taito milestones that was announced for Japan is going to be coming out in the US.

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.780
It's due in Japan on February 2022.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:49.140
It will be including Kix, which makes me happy, Alpine Ski, Frontline, Wild Western,

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:54.980
Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, the Fairyland story.

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.940
Fairyland story is fun.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:03.460
Hailey's Comet, the Ninja Warriors, which, you know, we got on SNES back in the day and

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.700
Arcade and whatnot.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.740
And there's another 10th game to come out that has yet to be announced.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:18.020
There will be limited and collector's editions for Strictly Limited Games Partner Store

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:22.500
on November 25th, which is already.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.580
And then, of course, there will be a standard that's for the standard edition and the

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:34.900
collector's edition will be limited to 2,000 copies and the limited will be limited to

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.020
3,000 copies.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:37.940
So there you go.

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.060
That's a neat little collection, though, because you've got some big names in there

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.340
like Kix, but there's a lot of more obscure titles in there, which is pretty cool.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:49.860
So it's just more stuff that wasn't really big over here.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.460
Yeah, but I think it's still really neat.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.180
So, yeah.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:53.300
All right.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.020
You know, I can play Kix for like all day.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:56.580
Oh, I know.

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:56.900
I know.

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.660
Kix is a real fun one.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.700
Excuse me.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.220
Yyr is in our chat.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:09.380
Hey, who says, sounds like this is releasing alongside the Taito mini arcade cabinet, which

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.900
is also due in February.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:11.460
That's right.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:16.020
I remember a story on that Taito cabinet does make a lot of sense for that all to come out.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:16.260
Good.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:16.500
Good.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.380
All right.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.060
What can I say, folks?

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.060
It's a slower news week, so we let in a few more rumors.

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.940
But, Loki, this is a rumor that's kind of coming back, right?

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.020
I'm only interested in one rumors.

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.460
Fleetwood Mac.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.860
Oh, I was going to say the single from Lindsay Lohan.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.260
Close.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:34.420
No.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.700
Fleetwood Mac.

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:42.660
So apparently there's a rumor that Chrono Cross is getting a remake.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:51.300
This was based off of a leak list that was on the, was it Nvidia?

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:57.940
And then there was also some other stuff that was coming from that as well.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:05.780
Basically saying now that I hear there's the JRPG and multi-platform, I assume PC, PlayStation,

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.340
Switch.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.380
That's my assumption.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.500
That's not what I was told, but that's just my assumption.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.300
So I don't know.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.420
It's a lot of rumors.

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:22.020
And this is, I guess, coming from as well, like a co-founder, Nick Baker of Xbox era

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.060
podcast.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:32.420
I'm not really sure how he's affiliated with the Nvidia database leak, but I guess we'll

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.220
wait and see.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.140
Well, what's interesting about this too, is it's not the first time this has come around.

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.700
I remember this was brought up on another show a few months ago.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.140
And on one hand, it does make a lot of sense because, you know, you have that team that

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.820
did the Secret of Mana reboot and they did the Tales of Mana.

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.260
And that was huge, or Trials, excuse me, of Mana, because, you know, that's the Tales

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:58.660
of is a completely different series, sorry, Trials of Mana, which, you know, that was

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:02.340
huge because we actually got that game for the first time in the US and all that good

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:02.840
stuff.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.380
What are they working on now?

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.220
You know, you would have to imagine they're probably remaking another.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:12.900
Well, and then they also did, I'm sorry, they did Legend of Mana, the one I like to forget

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:13.620
about.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.820
That also got remade.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.860
So it does make sense that, you know, Chrono Cross seems kind of like a target game to

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.980
get a remake.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:27.140
I'm sure a lot of people are wondering, why won't they touch Chrono Trigger and the big

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:27.940
one?

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.020
I think there might be hesitation.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.380
I think it's twofold.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:38.100
I think there might be hesitation that if they fuck it up, it's going to be disastrous

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.540
because a lot of people hold that game in very, very high regard.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.220
And I just do a third game.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:44.600
Right?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.140
I think that's a brilliant answer as well is just make a third game.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.220
The other thing with Chrono Trigger, I think the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters, I think

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.660
are the true test for that.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:01.220
I think they're going to gauge how those Pixel remasters do and potentially do a Chrono Trigger

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:05.700
one with that if those Final Fantasy remasters do well.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.380
So can I throw out something?

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:07.940
Sure, please.

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.940
Speaking of Chrono Trigger.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.440
Yeah.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.240
So, you know, I was in Alabama for my friend's funeral, right?

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:23.960
One of the last messages that my friend sent me, and I'll have to have to read it, was

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.720
I see a girl with her Nintendo playing Chrono Trigger while you made me love that game.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.600
Oh, that's a great memory.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.240
I love that.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:33.800
Yeah.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.800
So I have special memories of that game.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.040
And if they fuck it up, I will be livid.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.880
And I think there probably is some of that.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:49.480
I mean, if you fuck up Chrono Cross, you know, like, I'm not like, you know, it'll be all

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:49.800
right.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.800
You know, that game kind of a lot of people passed on it when it first came out.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.840
But I think you cannot fuck up Chrono Trigger.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.040
And I think exactly for that reason and many reasons.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.320
But again, I think they'll go the Pixel remaster route, assuming the Final Fantasy one through

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.120
six remasters do well, which it seems like they've been doing all right.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.960
I don't know how they're selling, but it seems like the reception to that I should see if

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.560
they're on sale this weekend.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.120
Probably not.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.400
But you never know because I still haven't picked them up because I'm being stubborn.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.200
I'm making them release it on Switch or PlayStation or Xbox would be great, too, before I pick

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.760
it up.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.880
That's for sure.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.400
I don't know why people are saying Chrono Cross wasn't that good because a lot of people

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:29.800
love it.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.440
Yeah, I think it's a lot of people who absolutely love that game.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.040
It's like Legend of Mana, too.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.880
I think Legend of Mana stinks.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.360
I know other people that think it's amazing.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.040
So it's those PlayStation.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:42.920
It's all a matter of taste.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.320
Don't say that something sucks when someone else might like it.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.640
So I mean, unless it has to do with racism or something that sucks.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.480
Racism always sucks.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:51.980
All right.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.600
Okay, one more story.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.760
And this comes from our Discord.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.840
So thank you for everybody who is participating in our Discord.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.080
And if you're not there yet, why don't you join?

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.520
vognetwork.com.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.760
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.160
We'll get you in our Discord and folks post stories for us to talk about, such as this

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:18.520
one, which is about a Sony patent that indicates Sony is getting back into mobile.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.760
Not maybe in the way you think.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:26.600
Apparently, the patent is for Sony Interactive Entertainment and is patenting a PlayStation

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.160
controller that's designed for mobile gaming.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.360
It was published by Sony Interactive's Japanese division, and it talks about playing games

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.920
on a device coupled with two controller grips.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.240
The controller looks a little bit like a DualShock 4, not so much a PlayStation 5, but it's

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.880
literally like a left side grip and a right side grip that your phone kind of goes in

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.600
the center of.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.920
The drawings that are around out there also have a shaft portion that can be tilted by

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.040
the user and it can kind of sense the tilting direction.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.080
I wonder if that's a PlayStation 3 six axis thing.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:01.400
I don't know.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.200
I'm just like, it's a very random, but I wonder if that's like a weird thing.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.080
What could this all be about?

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.760
Here's my thought on this.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:17.720
You know, I think it's probably really about trying to expand PlayStation Now and cloud

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:22.440
gaming to mobile, because right now, you know, that's all on Sony devices.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:26.840
I would think this is something they're going to look to expand to mobile, whether that

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.480
be through the web, because I know there's been like with Apple, it's been, you know,

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.800
they don't like to have the cloud services on there.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.080
So it just kind of depends.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.920
I could go a lot of different directions or maybe it'll stream from your PlayStation.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.720
Who fucking knows?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.400
It could go many different ways.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.760
But I think I would think this is them trying to get PlayStation Now and their cloud gaming

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:54.200
onto mobile devices and using this controller to do that.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.160
And for all I know, honestly, PlayStation Now is probably already on mobile, but it just

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.280
shows you how much I actually use that service, because I'm going to be honest, there's not

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.960
a lot of compelling stuff on it for me.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.960
The library isn't quite expansive enough, but maybe they're going to do another push

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.200
on it.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:08.680
Who knows?

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.200
So maybe they'll put Chrono Cross on it and Legend of Mana and we'll have reasons to

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.880
visit it and pick it up again.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.200
But I really my gut tells me this is about cloud gaming.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:25.880
And I think the people that are taking this to a PSP or PlayStation Vita type of place,

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.200
unless you're talking about it streaming from the cloud, I don't think you're right,

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.240
respectfully.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.600
I think this is literally something that's going to hold the phone that lets you play

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.840
cloud gaming and encourages you to keep a PlayStation.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.080
It would be neat if it actually streamed from your PlayStation 5, though, kind of like what

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.160
Microsoft's doing with X cloud and all that stuff.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.600
That'd be kind of cool.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.480
All right, let's move on.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:55.000
Let's go back to a simpler time before we had all this cloud gaming in our next segment.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.800
Here comes the bump.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.920
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.160
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.880
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.680
And what did you pick for us tonight, Darzaka?

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.240
I picked Pinball FX.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:23.720
Good pick.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:30.360
Pinball FX is a video game to emulate pinball tables.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:36.120
It came out on Xbox 360, developed by Zen Studios, published by Microsoft Game Studios

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.040
on April 25th, 2007.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.880
It was first released via Xbox Live Arcade, and it had three tables with six more downloadable

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.520
tables and later boards and online multiplayer.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.960
And it did, of course, have sequels.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.280
It kind of got mixed reviews.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.560
It was about the upper level of average.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:06.040
They said the physics were really good, but they didn't really care for multiplayer with

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.440
it being split screen, although some people were happy that it was there.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.480
And as of July 28th, 2010, it sold over 362,000 copies.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.040
It was followed by Pinball FX 2.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.800
It was delisted after Pinball FX 2 came out, but all of the purchases carried over to Pinball

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.520
FX 2.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:38.920
However, the corresponding tables were not available on the Xbox One version of Pinball

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.520
FX 2, but because it is backwards compatible, you can have it installed.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:52.440
It basically uses the same rules as a pinball table in a virtual environment.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:02.040
You have your ball on the play field, and you smack it around with your flippers, and

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:07.800
you run it into the bumpers, and you hit ramps, and you do all of the stuff that you do in

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.920
an actual pinball table.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.160
You have leaderboards, online multiplayer for up to four players.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:22.120
You win multiplayer by high score, and it came with three tables.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:25.240
Starting off, we had Speed Machine, which was a racing theme.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.880
We had Extreme, which is a skateboarding theme, and Agents, which were secret agents and spies.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:38.520
There was a fourth one called Buccaneer that was released October 31st, 2007 as a free

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:49.240
download, and then five additional paid ones that had some licensed content on there.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.160
There was Nightmare Mansion, which was sort of a horror movie one, and then there was

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.720
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.480
There was Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Earth Defense, which was Alien Invasion, and then the fifth

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:10.200
one Excalibur, which was based off of King Arthur.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.040
Because of the feedback for Pinball FX, then that went into Pinball FX 2.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.320
Like I said, the first one was a pretty mixed bag.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:31.560
A lot of people really liked it as a pinball engine, even going so far to compare it to

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.560
Pinball Dreams, which was a pinball sim by Digital Illusions that came out for the Amiga

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.600
in 1992.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.160
It was one of the big ones at the time.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:43.640
So good.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:50.120
Just saying, so good, Pinball Dreams, and that was one of the games I really enjoyed

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.200
playing on Antstream when I had it, actually.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.720
Ironically enough.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:08.520
But the thing that I think Pinball FX really set the stage for was now things like Zen

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.240
Pinball and all of the other online pinball we have that's allowing those licensed tables

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:15.400
in.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.320
For the longest time, we had Pin Maim.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:26.680
And with all the virtual tables, those were very much a labor of love by fans.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:37.560
But this was one that kind of brought it back into the eye of the home gamer.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:46.920
And I think that that really, I mean, as a pinball fan, I think that these virtual versions

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.680
might have brought just the art and fun of pinball back to people and make them want

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.120
to check out the real thing.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:57.720
That's my theory.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:07.480
Because now you can't go to a real barcade without having more pinball hanging around.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:13.320
And more and more collectors getting into actual pinball tables and so forth.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.560
And I think maybe, you know, these games, we just got our Ghostbusters back.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.680
Oh, that's awesome.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:20.360
Yeah.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:30.040
But I mean, and if I was going to touch on Pinball FX 2, which honestly, I could have

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.920
also done that as a classic game, but it brought in.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.040
I mean, like all kinds of different, like there was a portal.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.200
There were Marvel ones.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160
There was a lot of Marvel ones.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.360
There was Star Wars.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:53.720
There was, Alien vs Pinball was another series that was pretty neat.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.320
I mean, it really opened it up.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:03.640
And I honestly, now while I still prefer to play a physical table, it's not bad.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.080
It's really not bad.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.040
I am down.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.080
When it's impossible to find the table.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.120
It's a good pinch.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:13.560
Yeah.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.840
You know, if you don't feel like standing up either, you know, there's that is something

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.640
you can play from your couch and still kind of get some of the same fun.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.800
But I will agree.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.720
The physics are amazing.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.720
The physics are great.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.640
But there you go.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.400
That's our game Pinball FX.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:38.200
For Xbox Live Arcade, for Xbox 360.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.080
Lots of people in chat commenting on this.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.040
Let me get some of these.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.560
Mike Deft in chat says, wait, Pinball FX is over 10 years old.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.800
It's almost 15, believe it or not.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.880
It's one of those things that'll age as a gamer.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.440
That's for sure.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.480
Dark Tetsuya says, I have a few of the tables that they gave away in FX3, so I played around

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.120
with it a little bit.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:58.760
It was kind of fun.

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.960
She Hulk 10 in chat says, the game is awesome and it is an excellent simulator.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.800
And if you buy all the DLC, it's like having 100 pinball machines in your home.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.560
Great for preservation as well.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.600
You can also learn how to play the tables as well.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.240
It has tutorials for actual physical tables.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.480
You know, that's a great point that She Hulk puts out there because, you know, now that

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.200
Pinball FX has the licenses and they're doing, you know, especially in FX3, you have a lot

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.400
of like licensed tables.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.600
It gives you those instructions that you don't always have when you walk into the bar, right?

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.880
I mean, everybody kind of just knows how to play pinball.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.320
It's the opportunity to learn the rule set, to learn how to get to the wizard modes, for

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:37.720
example.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:44.040
Because there are some games, like we were, when we were doing Friendsgiving, one of Dan's

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.680
buddies was saying that he just discovered like one of the wizard modes in the new Jurassic

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.200
Park, the newer Jurassic Park.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:50.760
Yeah.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.000
I was like, I didn't know this was in here.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.840
It's a way to really study the game.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.840
I think would be a really good way to put it.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:01.320
You could really go that next layer deeper than you can in a noisy bar playing a dollar

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.800
a game, which is a great way to play pinball too, but, um, and, and really study the game.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.840
And I think that's pretty cool.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.160
It's also a good way to find some of those obscure tables that you just don't see out

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:11.720
in the wild.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.280
Yeah.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.160
Yeah, for sure.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.520
I mean, I mean, that's the newer ones, of course, but I mean, we have to look at where

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.560
it started.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.200
I thought I saw something about like Pinball FX is kind of like rebranding or, I mean,

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:22.920
they're rebooting.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:27.560
They're going back to the not Pinball FX 4, but like a Pinball FX that I think is coming

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.200
out next year.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:32.040
I thought I saw something about that floating around somewhere, um, which makes sense.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.560
It's, it's time to up to the PlayStation 5, the Series X and all that.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.040
Um, I wouldn't be, wouldn't be surprised.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:43.400
Um, uh, pod culture and chat says great for those who can't afford tables IRL.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.960
And Jaskren says, and for those without the space.

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.880
Yeah, that is, that is true.

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:51.160
Uh, oh, Bobby.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:51.640
Oh, thank you.

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.520
Bobby Blackwell says Epic Game Store exclusive.

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.160
So the new FX is going to be exclusive to Epic Game Store.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:57.880
Interesting.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:03.960
Is that just on the, um, you know, uh, computing front or are they not going to have it on

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.480
PS5, Xbox Series X?

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.480
That's kind of surprising to me if it skips those, but, um, interesting.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.560
Well, we'll have to follow and see what happens.

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:12.680
All right.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.480
Epic Games getting up all those exclusives, I guess.

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:16.840
All right.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.040
Let's, uh, now we're going to get into, and I mentioned tonight's show is going to be

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:20.840
a little bit shorter.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.320
So we actually were skipping rapid fire news tonight.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.840
We've already talked about the news.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.400
Uh, so, uh, what's the Loki OLR, uh, in chat.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.560
I was about to read this comment, but you're sitting right here.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.520
What is this you're talking about?

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.020
Loki?

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.160
Oh, you guys said that Pixel Poops number two wasn't on Moby Games.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:37.800
So I added it.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.320
Did it work?

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.000
Um, if they have to go through an approval process, so they're like, well, we need it.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.480
We need something that says shows the release date.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.760
I'm like, Oh, why?

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.260
Okay.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.400
Um, so I did that.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.760
And then they're like, well, we can't add it because this company is not in the database.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.240
Okay, fine.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.360
I'll have the company of Davis.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:58.520
Okay.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.360
Well, we need proof that this company is a thing.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.280
Um, hi, I'm the company.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:04.840
Exactly.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.160
It's president and CEO at your service.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:08.760
It's annoying.

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.640
So we'll see it.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.200
Let me add it pretty quick.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.600
Uh, the game page needs approval though.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.180
All right.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.400
Y'all go up vote or whatever.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:17.960
I don't know.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.080
There's nothing you can do.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:19.560
Okay.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.240
Your staff has to look at it.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.880
We need thoughts and prayers since there's nothing to do.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.680
It doesn't matter.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.600
You mean nothing will happen then.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.280
It won't matter.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:30.920
No one will care.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.080
Fingers crossed.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.280
It gets thoughts and prayers.

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:34.760
I know.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:35.400
I know.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:35.880
What else?

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.640
What else can I offer him at this time?

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.840
It's a Hanukkah miracle.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.040
Okay.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:40.600
All right, fine.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.320
I can't, I can't hand out Hanukkah miracles, Jamie.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.800
You're not a real game unless you put out a Kickstarter.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.040
That's how it works with NES games nowadays.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.200
All right.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.840
Uh, we, we have no rapid fire news tonight.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.200
So instead we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.480
games coming out very soon, if anything.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.880
Although actually no, this week we do have a few.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.440
Uh, let's go to the US, Loki.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:05.080
I know of one.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:11.640
We have, uh, Beyond a Steel Sky that's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.960
5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:23.000
Uh, Clockwork Aquario that's on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, Evil Genius 2 World

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.120
Domination on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.040
We have, um, Daroku Agents of Sakuratan or Sakuratani, uh, that's on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.320
Uh, Solar Ash on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.520
Uh, Big Brain Academy, Brain vs Brain on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:55.960
Uh, Chorus on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Stadia.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.200
Uh, Danganronpa Decadence on Nintendo Switch.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:00.700
What?

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.480
And a new Danganronpa?

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.180
Yes.

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:11.100
And, uh, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition on Nintendo Switch.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.860
That's a Disney life simulation game.

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.220
That sounds weird.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.420
I, I don't think that is a new Danganronpa.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.260
I think it's a repackaging of the old ones.

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:24.220
Yeah, PesoPockets in chat says that's the package of one to three, isn't it?

01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:24.860
Yeah, I think it is.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.780
So I think it's just a, well, there's only two games that are worthwhile in that package

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.280
then.

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.180
All right.

01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:35.260
Uh, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases, uh, over there this week.

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:40.380
So on the Nintendo Switch this week, uh, we have Clockwork Aquario is out in Japan as

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:40.940
well.

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:45.100
And we also have this week, Paw Patrol, the movie Adventure City Calls.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.260
Yes, that is a Japanese release too.

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.300
Um, Disney games do pretty well, um, overseas as well.

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:54.540
Disney Magic Castle, My Happy Life 2 is also out in Japan this week.

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.940
Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.660
Checking out the PlayStation 5 this week, we have also Clockwork Aquario, uh, and we

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:07.260
have that same Paw Patrol movie game as well.

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:14.220
And that Disney Magic Castle, it's literally the same list on the PlayStation 5 as well.

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.340
Wait, no, I'm sorry, guys.

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.980
My list bounced up a little bit.

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.260
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:24.700
Um, dude, was I looking at PlayStation 4?

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.580
There's actually nothing on PlayStation 5 this week.

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.220
Okay, it was PlayStation 4.

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.300
All those same things are on PlayStation 4 this week.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.500
Sorry, my list skipped around because I hit the wrong thing.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.300
My bad.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:39.260
Um, but yeah, those are the releases that are out this week in Japan.

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.540
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.140
We have a few.

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:48.940
Um, on the 30th, we have Evil Genius 2 World Domination on PlayStation and Xbox and also

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:53.660
Oddworld Soulstorm Day 1 Audition on Xbox.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:36:01.660
And then, uh, further in December, we have, I'm just double checking my, my dates on here.

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:06.780
We have Cricket 22 Official Games of the Ashes,

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.660
Who Wants to be a Millionaire New Edition,

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.340

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.420
And on the sixth, we have Never Song for Switch.

01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:45.740
All right, there's your releases for the week.

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.300
One more story for you guys tonight.

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.380
And this is more of a, hey, did you know this?

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:56.060
Speaking about the age of games and so forth, uh, as of November 22nd,

01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.340
Rez is now a 20-year-old game.

01:36:59.340 --> 01:36:59.820
That's right.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:04.380
Rez turned 20 this past week, 20 years old since that game came out.

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:09.500
Um, and what's pretty cool to kind of celebrate that and, uh, mark the occasion for this game,

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:13.100
uh, the Enhance YouTube channel, um, Enhance, of course,

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:17.180
Tetsuya Mizuguchi's company he's working with now, they're the ones that did Tetris Effect.

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.740
Uh, I believe are credited with the Rez VR experience as well,

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.940
because both, both those games run in the Synesthesia engine.

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:31.900
I know that Rez VR Area X was a prototype for a new Rez game that didn't happen for whatever

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:32.460
reason.

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.900
Maybe it's explained in the documentary because the Enhance YouTube channel actually put up

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:41.180
a short documentary that talks about how the game was conceived, uh, anecdotes, experiences

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.540
from people around the industry and, uh, just kind of talking about how everybody back then

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.340
was like, you got to see this, you got to see this, you got to play this game.

01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.420
Trans vibrator, you wouldn't believe it.

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.020
So, um, that's pretty cool.

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.540
You know, there was a lot of really cool stuff back in the day, especially on the Dreamcast.

01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:59.180
You know, when you think back to things like Samba de Migo and so forth, and even things

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:03.100
of that era, you know, Parappa the Rappa was really big back then and so forth.

01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:06.860
Um, it's, it's awesome that Rez is getting a little bit of love as well.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:09.820
Uh, and of course, as we know, Rez did get that release.

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:14.780
I just talked about in 2016 with the optional VR, and then there was Area X and all that

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:15.580
stuff as well.

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.620
And it's even on the cloud now it's on Amazon Luna.

01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.740
I had no idea.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:22.140
So, um, this game is still alive all these years later.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.740
And I think that is pretty cool.

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:28.060
Um, nowhere mentioned Child of Eden and that's, that's too bad because that game, that's a

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:28.620
great game too.

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.460
I know that game should get revisited here and there too, but I'm always, I always am

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.860
looking forward to what Tetsuya Mizuguchi has next.

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.780
I think of, of, of probably some, one of my all time favorite game designers, if not

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.700
maybe the all time, who knows?

01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:45.580
Um, and if we're done with, uh, with Child of Eden, maybe we can have Angry Adolescent

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.060
of Limbo.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:53.260
Uh, YYR in chat says Area X was really something right up there with Poly, Poly, Polybius.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.060
I can never say that again.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:54.700
Polybius.

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.580
As a must play of the FPSVR.

01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.500
That's pretty funny because Polybius doesn't.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.540
Well, it does now, but yeah, I know what I mean.

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:05.420
Yeah, I know based off an urban legend and all that stuff.

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:05.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:07.660
So I covered it as a classic game.

01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:08.220
I know you did.

01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.780
I know you did, but how that was a long time ago though.

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:17.180
So yeah, but anyway, uh, YYR does point out Child of Eden is backwards compatible on Xbox.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.300
Is it now?

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.140
I think I have the disc somewhere.

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.180
I need to try it.

01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.180
I'd love to play that game again, just for fun.

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:27.020
Cause I think it's kind of like the forgotten about sequel anyway, to that game.

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.260
Well, happy birthday Rez.

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.260
Congrats on 20 years old.

01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:33.260
And, uh, how old does that make you feel?

01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.420
I know it makes me feel old.

01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:35.980
All right.

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.980
Let's talk about the listener round table.

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.380
We're going to take your topics in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:45.740
And then of course, if you want to call in the discords open, uh, if you want to head

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.980
over to the green room, we'll take those calls as well.

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.900
Uh, and I want to get to the mailbag.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.500
I know we have at least one email tonight.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.700
Let's get to it.

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.260
Ooh, two.

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:53.900
All right.

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.100
Uh, let's get to it.

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.860
Participate at orangelauntrady.com is the place to send us an email.

01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.820
Dar Sakura, take it away.

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.100
All right.

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:06.380
Our first email is hello, Rob Loki and dark Sakura.

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.380
I was thinking about the orange challenge.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:13.020
Fudio could be replaced with a kind of support chat about diabetes.

01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:17.660
Other members of your audience could answer your questions, offer some encouragement and

01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:18.780
tips and maybe recipes.

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.900
And we could all offer you some hope and camaraderie.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.220
We could do a vote among the listeners.

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:29.340
If this is acceptable, my husband is battling pre-diabetes and has the gene on both sides

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:29.980
of his family.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.940
We have started changing our diet as if we have diabetes to help slow his progress and

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.620
to get used to the changes early.

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.940
I know it sucks and feels frustrating.

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:43.020
We just used our emergency money to buy an exercise bike here in Baltimore.

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.820
It's not the safest to jog outside all the time and lifestyle changes are overwhelming

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:48.860
at the moment.

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:50.700
I hope this flattens out for you.

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:54.220
And it sounds like the changes you've made already are having a positive effect.

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.980
I'll be thinking of you while I eat my salad and water.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.260
Mere Muse.

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.340
Thank you, Mere Muse.

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:01.980
Thank you for that.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:06.460
That's a very well-intentioned and great suggestion.

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:11.020
I think my only problem with that and shifting the conversation away from the Fudio thing

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.740
to diabetes is I do feel in some way it kind of makes it all about me.

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:18.620
And it's like I'm spoiling the fun of the Fudio event.

01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:22.220
Again, I know your suggestion is completely well-intentioned and I think everybody would

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.180
support it.

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:27.100
However, I want my brain to be able to get to a place where I can talk about all the

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.740
food that I used to enjoy and so forth.

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:35.180
The good news I have is that I don't talk to a doctor again for a couple more weeks,

01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:41.660
but just in running my numbers because I do the self blood sugar checks with the needle

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:45.260
and all that only a few times a week now, not every day.

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:48.860
In the beginning, when I was first diagnosed, it was every day, but my numbers were looking

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.780
really good after the first week that she cut it back where I only have to check a couple

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.740
times a week.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.940
And I can say that my levels, the last couple of times I've checked, are coming way down.

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:07.420
For those that speak the language, I tested 107 on Friday and 103 today.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.740
So I'm getting in a really good place.

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:15.420
So I just kind of want to keep riding that wave and see what my doctor has to say about

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:15.980
it.

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.860
I know that it's not something that's going to change overnight, but I'm losing weight

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.660
as a side effect of this whole thing since I hit my all-time highest weight this summer,

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.540
as I'm sure a lot of people did during the pandemic.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:31.100
I'm now down 14 pounds from that.

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.620
So yeah, I didn't lose all at once.

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:37.740
I don't want people to get concerned.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.420
There's a certain amount of weight you kind of lose fast at the beginning anyway, and

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:45.500
now it's the slow grind down and all that stuff.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:51.820
So yeah, I'm going to talk to my doctor, I think I'd be due for that in a week or two

01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:55.820
to kind of do the month follow-up and see how it's going and then go from there.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:02.300
My hope is that I can, there's no real cure for it, of course, but you can kind of put

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:05.500
it into remission and that's kind of my goal.

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.300
And I think if I lose the weight, I think I might get there.

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:12.700
Well, I mean, that happened with, I mean, because you know, I've been in, you know,

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:19.180
a number of gastric bypass support groups before when I had, I mean, I wasn't quite

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:26.700
at, I was almost to the pre-levels before my surgery, but I also don't have the genetic

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.060
predisposition towards it.

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:28.940
Right.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:29.340
And I do.

01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.540
Yeah.

01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:37.900
And so right after I had my surgery and dropped my weight, I've been middle of the road,

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.420
no matter what I eat.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:46.140
And I think that it should be pointed out that there is a lot that is genetic about

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:50.540
it and not to assume things about people who might be over a certain weight.

01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:50.860
Yes.

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:51.420
Thank you.

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.140
It's very important.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:58.140
And yeah, and again, I want to address the email because I do think it's a very kind

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.980
and very thoughtful suggestion and I really appreciate, you know, again, I think your

01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:03.580
heart is really in the right place for that.

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:07.980
And I obviously am right there with you and your husband and going through the changes

01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:08.540
and so forth.

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:13.820
And I'm going to be very transparent and say like, I'm really glad you guys are doing

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:18.380
something about it now because I didn't get the courtesy of a pre-diabetes phase.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:19.180
I didn't get that.

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.180
So, and that's the most frustrating thing about this whole situation.

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:29.340
So the fact that you guys are like doing something about it now, I think really speaks to you

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.260
guys in a positive way and so forth.

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.980
Now, here's the other thing I kind of want to say with that.

01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:37.180
Even though I'm a little uncomfortable saying, okay, I want to take this orange launch video

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:40.860
thing and now, no, it has to be all about me because I came down with diabetes.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:46.540
Even though I'm a little hesitant to do that, I am now going to be speaking from a place

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.500
where that's just part of me and that's something that I'm living with and that's just who I

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.220
am.

01:44:52.220 --> 01:45:00.700
And genetics, fatness, or otherwise, I'm not going to shy away from the conversation about

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:03.020
it sucks to have diabetes.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.420
It's very similar to the fact that I've been out and gay on this show for nearly 20 years

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.500
and I don't apologize for that either.

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:15.020
And I talk about my husband pretty openly because that is the life I live.

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:22.860
And if that's not something you're comfortable hearing, tough titty because that's my life.

01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:29.580
So I kind of think to kind of go to your, like back to your email and everything, I

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:33.740
think when we do orange launch video, and I think I will get there, I will get to a

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.260
mental place where I'll be able to do it.

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.940
I'm going to speak to things from this perspective because that's my life now.

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:42.620
And that's, you know, who a part of who I am.

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.460
And I think folks understand that.

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.740
And yeah.

01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.580
That's me with my autism.

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.460
Yes, it is me with my surgery.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:50.960
Yes.

01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:55.420
It's just everyone has a different experience.

01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:02.060
And we all come from a place of our own experiences.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:09.180
And that needs to be understood when people talk about these things.

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:15.660
So I think that honestly, I don't think that it would be making things about about you.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.820
Just saying, I think.

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:21.660
And I'm admitting that's, that's a personal sort of crisis I'm having.

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:22.540
If that makes sense.

01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:23.040
Yeah.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.800
But I think it's something that could at least be involved in the discussion.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.300
Maybe.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.400
Talk about if I'm there, it will like that.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.840
That's my, that's kind of my point, right?

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.360
That's not quite what I meant.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.000
Okay.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.800
Talk about like proper, you know, just nutrition in general.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.920
You know, talk about habits, talk about mindfulness.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.720
You know, it, it goes in with the discussion about food in general.

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:57.520
And then how bad that I was when I went to Taco Bell.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:04.160
But at the same time, like if you like, you know, to go, even though I talked about a lot

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.160
of good things, just for shits and giggles, I never do this.

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.360
But since I have the home testing kit, I decided, you know what?

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.360
I'm going to test myself after Thanksgiving dinner.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.320
And I didn't go overboard with Thanksgiving dinner.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.600
But we go out as we did every year and I got, you know, ham as I always do.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.880
I ate a lot of vegetables.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.000
But I had a little bit.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.240
I had maybe half the mashed potatoes, which is, you know, a little bit carby.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.680
And I ate a piece of pumpkin pie.

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:28.320
I said, you know what?

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.840
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.360
I'm having a fucking piece of pumpkin pie.

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:33.360
Tested myself when I got home.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.200
257.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.360
No, geez.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.080
So, which is not good for those that don't speak the language.

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:46.160
I don't know if that's a matter of just maybe I tested at the wrong time.

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.960
I waited two hours or at least I tried to, I don't know.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:53.520
It could be a variety of things, but I would have tested after 24 hours, to be honest.

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.040
Well, see, but that's the crazy thing.

01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.000
The next day in the morning, I have my lowest reading yet.

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.880
So it's this weird thing where, like, my body is like spiking like crazy with.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:09.360
And, you know, yeah, I know I did a bad.

01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.480
I'm not supposed to have pumpkin pie.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:10.880
I did.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.000
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.120
Let me have this.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.040
If we don't do the nice thing for ourselves once in a while, like the Taco Bell.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.840
That was not a nice thing.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.280
Well, OK, the Swedish meatballs like you, whatever it is for you.

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.960
And I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to cheat every month or anything like that,

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.480
but it's one of those things where it's like, but even when I had the Thanksgiving dinner,

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.480
I was like, I'm not going to put butter on the bread.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.440
I can skip that.

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.680
I'm not going to have sweet tea like I usually do.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.520
I'm going to skip that and have unsweet tea.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.000
I still cut corners, you know, and I still and then I walked 10,000 steps the next day.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.720
So, you know, there are still things.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.160
But anyway, that's a whole nother.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.120
I'm getting off track.

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.480
Thank you for the email.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.760
Thank you for the suggestion.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.560
And my thoughts are certainly with your husband and yourself.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.800
And thank you for being there to support him because I can tell you.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.800
I don't want to get emotional, but if I didn't have Alan right now.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.360
This would be a very dark place.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.320
This would be a very, very dark place if I didn't have Alan right now.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.520
That is all I'm going to say.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.000
And I think you all can read between the lines on that.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.960
SSG100Matt in chat says, hoping for the best for you, Rob,

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:23.440
both physically and mentally while you go through this.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.160
I will take it.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.880
I will take your thoughts and prayers on this

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:30.720
because there is literally nothing else anyone can do.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.800
This is a me thing that I have to work through.

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.000
There's literally nothing else you can do.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.040
So I'll take it and I appreciate it.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.320
Honestly, it's all in your hands.

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:44.820
Yes.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.920
Because the only one who's going to be able to make the healthy decisions and enact it is you.

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.720
And we can all support you.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:50:00.000
What I tell people all the time anyway is that things don't change in our lives

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.160
until we do what we need to to make them change.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.560
And that's practically with anything.

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.560
So I have to say, I'm really proud of you.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.880
And I know, yeah, maybe it was necessity that pushed you to it,

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.280
but I'm still really proud that you're doing what you need to,

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.720
because I have a friend who's completely failing at managing hers.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.200
Thank you.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.840
And I met somebody as well who told me they have it,

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.480
and I had no idea because they don't do anything about it.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.480
And it kind of surprised me.

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.520
I have to be honest.

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.320
So the things my body was doing, I couldn't really ignore it.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.600
I have to, but I've been approaching it as a,

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.200
this is God and I'm using my quotey fingers, whatever you believe in.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.240
I'm using my quotey fingers.

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.360
This is supreme being telling me I need to go on a diet.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.440
And so, okay, you know what?

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.760
Sure, I'll go on a dog.

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.800
I'll try to get skinny like I was in high school.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.040
I don't think I'll get all the way there, but why not?

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.920
I'll lose a few pounds and see where that puts us.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.280
And go from there.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.360
So, and I see your muses in chat.

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.560
Thank you again for the email.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.520
Thank you for supporting what your husband is going through.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.800
It's again, like I said, the spousal support is huge.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.760
Huge, huge, huge.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.520
Anyway, and I was gonna say, the other thing that friends can do,

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.440
like don't, like the thing that dark soccer and Loki and so forth,

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.080
the thing they can do, don't fucking bring a pie here

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.400
or don't bring cookies here and don't bring candy here.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.400
Like that, you know, you all know that now.

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.640
And we all know we used to do that, but things are different now.

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.080
We know things now we didn't know then.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.640
And so it's different now, but you guys in chat,

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.880
I don't think there's a lot you can do with not bringing over cake.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.760
So I'll take your thoughts.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.520
And besides that, I'm pretty good at sugar-free pies.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:52.720
Oh, that's good.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.240
That's good.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.800
Hey, I did the low carb thing for like how long?

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.600
Trust me, I can make a low carb pie.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.100
No.

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:01.380
All right.

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:02.500
You said we had a second email.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:03.800
Yeah.

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.300
Hello, LR, I just wanted to share a few random thoughts

01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:10.820
as well as some reactions of mine to slightly older episodes.

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.660
Maybe you remember, or maybe you don't,

01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:17.380
that Neko Atsume VR, a virtual reality adaptation

01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:19.380
of everyone's favorite mobile cat collecting game

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.260
was released a few years ago for Japanese PS4s.

01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:22.900
Do you remember?

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:26.900
I have almost enough credit in my Japanese PSN account to buy it.

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.460
So every so often I check to see if it went on sale.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.940
This time, however, suffered something even better.

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:35.060
Neko Atsume VR is now available in North America.

01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:37.060
It was released just this past August.

01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:40.740
For only $17, you can relive the joy and thrills of Neko Atsume

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:44.020
in glorious first generation PlayStation VR.

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.780
So if you're interested, pounce on that.

01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:46.280
Good tip.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.620
You recently mentioned Mega Man Battle Network

01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:51.300
as classic game of the week.

01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.140
One of the chat comments mentioned

01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:55.060
that they would love to see a successor.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.900
Well, a successor already exists.

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.740
It's called One Step From Eden,

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.420
and it's a deck-building roguelite

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:02.980
that uses Battle Network's grid-based battle system

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.700
as its basis.

01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:07.060
Along with a lengthy single-player campaign,

01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:09.860
it also features local PVP and co-op.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:12.980
Steam's user reviews are overwhelmingly positive,

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:16.340
and it's available in every modern console and PC platform,

01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.700
yes, including Mac.

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:20.100
So if you enjoyed Battle Network back in the day,

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.700
you really ought to check it out.

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:25.860
While playing Forza Horizon 5, I realized something.

01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:28.820
A lot of folks just say that it's Forza Horizon 4

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:31.220
on a different map, and in a way, it is.

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.460
But this doesn't give credit to the massive number

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.540
of new features, refinements, and improvements

01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.540
that were made to Forza Horizon 4

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.860
since it launched back in 2018.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.380
If you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch

01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:45.700
to Forza Horizon 4 today, yes,

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.660
they look almost like the same game on two different maps.

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.180
However, if you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.220
to day one version of Forza Horizon 4,

01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.620
you will see a generational leap

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:00.740
that is in almost every respect,

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.820
and I wish more folks would recognize this.

01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:04.900
Anyway, that's it now from me.

01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.340
Thanks again for the show as always,

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:07.460
and have a great week.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:11.060
Trying to shake off post-holiday doldrums, YYR.

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.300
Thanks, YYR.

01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:16.660
And for those that are saying that Forza Horizon 5

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:18.660
is just more Forza Horizon 4,

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:20.020
why is that a bad thing?

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.580
It's like continuing this great song,

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.740
this great adventure, this great movie

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.420
with more of what you love.

01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.100
But yeah, I also do agree.

01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:34.180
Certainly the step up to series X and series S,

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:35.620
I know YYR has been playing on,

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:38.180
but that step up to be able to do that

01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:40.980
from a graphical perspective just makes the game look

01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.420
even that much better.

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.340
And just, I think there's a lot to appreciate.

01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.900
I do see a step up,

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:50.020
but maybe I get that it's not the same step up

01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.380
from three to four, two to three,

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:54.100
but why is that bad?

01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.340
It's getting to the point where Forza Horizon

01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.140
is so fucking good.

01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.500
It's consistently a 90 plus critic reviewed game.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:01.940
Not that it matters what the critics think,

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.540
but when they all are saying the same thing,

01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:04.980
you can't help but listen.

01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:06.820
It's constantly a 90 plus game.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:09.380
How much better can we make it?

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:10.980
It's got a good formula.

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:11.620
Go with it.

01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:14.820
So Mike Defton Chat says,

01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.620
it's not a bad thing,

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:17.860
but that doesn't make it a game of the year contender.

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:18.900
And Bobby Blackwell says,

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:20.660
Deft, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.900
And I am gonna side with Bobby on this one.

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:26.580
I will give Deft this.

01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:31.220
I understand that that is probably the reason

01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:33.380
it's getting overlooked for game of the year

01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:36.100
is that it's a little too repetitive for some.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:39.060
It's like, oh, well, four already did this.

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.220
So why would we nominate five game of the year

01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.180
when four did this?

01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:44.260
But I'm of the mindset where it's like,

01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:46.180
well, you didn't give four game of the year.

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.420
At some point, you need to acknowledge

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.940
what the series is doing.

01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:51.780
And at some point you need to...

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.820
It's like that person that's long overdue

01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:55.940
for their fucking Oscar.

01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.820
At some point, Glenn Close better win a fucking Oscar.

01:55:58.820 --> 01:55:59.320
Am I right?

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:03.060
So there's just that whole thing.

01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:07.060
So anyway, as Joe and Hunter Matt puts in chat,

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.740
not many games make it to game five.

01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:10.820
At some point, you got to give the series an award.

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.020
Big, strong agree.

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:15.220
But at the same time, awards aren't everything.

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:18.100
I know the Grammy Award nominations came out this week.

01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:21.060
And I have to say, I don't give a fuck about the Grammys.

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.340
It's been pointed out many times,

01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.340
many issues with the Grammys.

01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.700
Go look at what The Weeknd had to say

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.900
about the whole thing last year.

01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:31.780
My understanding is, though,

01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.100
and of course I'm going to smile and go,

01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:34.980
all right, that's cute.

01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:36.660
ABBA got nominated.

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:39.220
You all know I love ABBA from the 70s, right?

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:43.460
ABBA got nominated for their first ever Grammy this week

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.340
because I still have faith in you.

01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:49.060
The reunion single got nominated for song of the year,

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:50.420
record of the year, one of those two things.

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.100
And I'm just sitting here going,

01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.900
the greatest pop band of all time,

01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.700
in my humble opinion,

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.380
the greatest pop band of all time

01:56:57.380 --> 01:56:59.620
getting nominated for their first Grammy

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.620
just now in the year 2021

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.860
says all you need to know about why the Grammys are terrible.

01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:06.580
I'm surprised they didn't get nominated

01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.020
for best new artist, to be honest.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.420
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.180
oh yeah, speaking of the game awards,

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:17.220
do we want to apply for an official co-stream for that, Rob?

01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:17.860
Sure, yeah.

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.660
What was the time that it starts?

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.980
It doesn't start earlier than five Pacific, right?

01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.300
I don't think it does.

01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:27.620
As long as it's not earlier than five Pacific, I can do,

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:29.060
oh wait, I take that back.

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:29.780
What am I thinking?

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:30.900
I can do four Pacific.

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.180
So as long as, okay, that great.

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:35.780
Sounds good.

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.700
Next next Thursday.

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.180
Yeah, since it looks like getting down there to LA

01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:42.340
is probably not going to happen for a multitude of reasons.

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:43.460
So that's fine.

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.300
I like what Jaskren said in chat.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.140
Art is not a competition.

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.260
I like that.

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:48.980
It's very good.

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:50.180
You know what?

01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:51.700
Your game of the year probably was,

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.460
there's probably gonna be lots of people's game of the years

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:54.340
that weren't nominated.

01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:56.340
And that's, that's what it is.

01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.140
That's funny.

01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:59.620
Art is to a competition with yourself

01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:00.580
cause it's never done.

01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.060
All right.

01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:03.780
Fair perspective.

01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.340
Ooh, I'm almost missing a call in the green room.

01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.700
I don't want to do that.

01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:09.780
Let's get, yeah, I got to go to the green room and say,

01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:11.380
hello, you're on orange lounge radio.

01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:11.940
Who's this?

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.340
Hey, what's going on everybody?

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.060
It's Rama.

01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:16.420
Hey Rama, it's good to hear from you.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:18.660
Right back at you.

01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.260
As you can see, I actually left the house for Thanksgiving.

01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:22.820
What?

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:24.100
Leaving the house?

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:24.900
Overrated.

01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.580
Who does that anymore?

01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.740
I know it's a new thing.

01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:32.820
And besides, I wore my mask and it was a very nice

01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:36.980
Thanksgiving feast followed by laying around,

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.180
watching TV and doing Black Friday shopping online

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.540
where everything is delivered to the house.

01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:45.220
You know, very chill stuff.

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:46.740
That is a great, that's, you know,

01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.180
between the walking and everything,

01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:51.460
I spent a lot of my extended weekend playing video games

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:53.140
and that felt very good.

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.500
SSJ100Matt in chat says,

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.900
putting on pants is very overrated.

01:58:56.900 --> 01:58:57.380
Truth.

01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:58.500
Truth.

01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.060
It depends on your version of pants.

01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:02.420
Cause some people need to wear underwear.

01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:05.140
US pants.

01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:08.100
Hey, that works.

01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:10.100
That works.

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:13.140
And before I want to talk about what I want to call in,

01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.900
I just want to say that, you know,

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.820
while I was doing my shift on Friday, working from home,

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:19.620
I figured, you know what,

01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:21.780
let me turn on the switch and play some games.

01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:24.260
I ended up finding myself looking at Paramount Plus

01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:27.140
and watching a documentary called Console Wars.

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:30.180
But what was great about it was from Sega's point of view.

01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:31.380
So it was really interesting.

01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:31.880
Ooh.

01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.860
I don't think I've seen that one.

01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:34.500
I have to look that up.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.940
I think I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it.

01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.660
I need to look that up.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.500
I just stumbled upon it.

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.140
I'm like, 16-bit graphics.

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.340
Let me see what this is all about.

01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.220
Oh, wow.

01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:45.780
This is from the other side.

01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.660
This is good.

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.900
Paramount Plus has some good stuff on it, I got to say.

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.220
Like, again, I'm not being paid to shill them,

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.180
but I know there's a lot of talk about everybody's got their own streaming service.

01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.300
But I get that.

01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:01.700
But I will say, you know, because Paramount Plus was the CBS thing,

02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:02.580
which was kind of weak.

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:04.980
It's a lot stronger now.

02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:05.700
I will say this.

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:06.660
Like, the fact they're getting, like,

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:09.140
international versions of Survivor is super cool to me.

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:13.140
And that real-world reunion, they just started.

02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:14.980
So I don't know if you guys even know this.

02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:18.900
The real-world Los Angeles, which, like, that was when I was in high school.

02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:22.900
Like, that was, like, growing up on, like, that series and watching it on TV.

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:24.260
That was reality TV, right?

02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:26.100
Okay, so there was a girl from Alabama.

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:27.300
I was like, oh, my gosh.

02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:28.340
Get this, Dark Sakura.

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:33.300
So what they did all these years later, it's a Paramount Plus exclusive show.

02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:35.620
They got all of the original.

02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:37.220
So they did it for the first one, New York.

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:40.260
They got all of the original cast together, except for one guy,

02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:41.860
because he tested positive for COVID.

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:47.140
And they put them in a similar apartment and put them there for a week to revisit everything.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:51.860
Well, they just debuted the second season with the LA cast.

02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:57.460
And let me tell you, that cast has some history and they really get into it.

02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:59.460
And you want to talk about alternate points of view.

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.580
Because everybody knows about, like, that hallway incident.

02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:04.980
Like, that was television, right?

02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:06.900
Is that the cast that had Pedro?

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.860
No, that was three.

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.140
That got dice here.

02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:09.780
Yeah.

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:12.660
Apparently, they're skipping from two to nine.

02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:14.260
They've already renewed it for a third season.

02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.460
They're going to go all the way to the New Orleans one, because for whatever reason,

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.460
I would imagine the San Francisco one just they could not get enough.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.700
Like, there's always someone who sits it out.

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.340
Obviously, we lost Pedro, and that is horribly tragic.

02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:29.460
But I think with San Francisco, they probably I doubt, you know,

02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:31.300
that conservative girl that's been on the view.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:32.740
She's not going to fucking do it.

02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:35.460
Uh, and a lot of those people in the cast are not going to do it.

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:39.060
But the L.A. people, I was surprised they got a lot of those people to do it.

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:42.580
There's a couple missing, but they got the people that were involved in that

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.100
whole thing with the trying to pull the girl's clothes off

02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.500
with the blanket and dragging down the hallway.

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.780
I remember that.

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:50.020
Yeah.

02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.380
See, that was very, very.

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.740
That was disgusting.

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:54.820
And they get into it.

02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:57.860
And you you want to talk about hearing it from another point of view.

02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:59.220
You find out things.

02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:01.300
I'm not going to spoil it for those of you.

02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:04.580
You hear her talk about things that she was dealing with at the time

02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:07.620
that she never disclosed when she was doing the show.

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.340
And it makes you look at that from a whole new light.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.940
And it's it's really, really interesting.

02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:16.180
And the aggressor is still right there.

02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:20.420
And at least at the end of the first episode, he wasn't totally hearing it.

02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:25.300
He really wasn't still still all these years later really understanding it.

02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:29.780
It was just it was really it's hard to watch in some ways.

02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:31.300
And they have a car intent warning on it.

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.660
But I thought it was so interesting all these years later, for sure.

02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:36.900
I might have to look on like YouTube or something.

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:37.460
Yeah.

02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:38.900
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to.

02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:43.060
I didn't mean to show Paramount Plus during your call, Rama.

02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:47.620
But I will say, like there is I know they've been getting a lot of shit

02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:50.820
about Star Trek Discovery in Europe as they should.

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:53.620
But at least here in the US, it's got a lot of good shit.

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:57.780
Jaskren says the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga concert also aired tonight on Paramount Plus.

02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.220
Really?

02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:00.180
I'm going to watch it.

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:02.180
They have the Madame X Madonna thing, too.

02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:06.420
I got to say, Paramount Plus is I get why people dog on it.

02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:08.420
But at the same time, they've got some really good shit.

02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:10.500
Like they're up and coming pretty good.

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:11.460
And yes, they did.

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:12.820
They fixed the Discovery thing.

02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:18.340
They're putting it on Pluto TV, which is Viacom's free thing in the UK.

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:20.180
So I don't know how that all works.

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:22.740
But yes, the UK gets Discovery after all.

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:24.420
Anyway, Rama, I'm sorry.

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:26.500
What did you actually call that tonight?

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.620
Not streaming TV.

02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:30.500
Because you mentioned Gaga, I'm going to.

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.700
Are you going to see House of Gucci?

02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:32.260
Yes or no?

02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:38.020
No, because my friends that have seen it have all said it's not great.

02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:41.060
Like it's not bad, but it's not great.

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:45.940
And just watch it when it's on Paramount Plus or whatever service it's on.

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:46.820
That's what I've heard about.

02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:47.380
Sounds good.

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:51.380
You know, I love me some Gaga, though, but can I sit there for two and a half hours when

02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.300
she's only in like 15, 20 minutes of it?

02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:53.700
I don't know.

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:55.860
Fair enough.

02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:04.100
So what I want to talk about real quick is along the lines of the whole Bobby Kotek drama,

02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:10.100
because we had something similar happen out here a few years back at a local convention

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:11.140
to summarize.

02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:12.660
We had a con chair.

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:19.220
He was one of those where if there was any issues whatsoever, you talk directly to him.

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:23.620
He was always on the floor talking to people and he would do whatever he could to take

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:24.340
care of it.

02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:29.300
Well, there were some harassment issues coming that he was aware of.

02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:32.340
So he did the right thing as the con chair.

02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:35.300
He brought it up to the board and explained what was going on.

02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:40.900
There were some department heads who thought that their shit didn't stink as well as harassing

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:41.860
other people.

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:47.220
And from my understanding, the board was basically like the boys club.

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:52.820
So as much as my friend, who was the con chair, kept bringing it up and trying to fix things,

02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.380
he ended up stepping down.

02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.980
He says, I can't do it anymore.

02:04:56.980 --> 02:05:01.380
It was basically him against the world and he couldn't fight it.

02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:13.620
So we have a new con chair come in and things got a lot worse and I can later send you links

02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.460
to articles in regards to it.

02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:18.660
But let's just say the harassment continued.

02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:22.100
The con chair just threw a blind ear to it.

02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:26.340
He was also like, well, if you scratch my back, I scratch your back, too.

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:31.300
You know, it got to the point where people got tired of it.

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:39.060
He stepped down and now we have a new con chair running this convention and he's basically

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:42.100
unfucking everything that had happened.

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.660
So but the board is all still there.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:49.860
Far as I know, a couple of members of the board are still there.

02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:55.700
The issue is with a lot of anime conventions is that it starts out as a fun thing.

02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:00.420
And then when you realize what you can do and what power you have, it goes to your head

02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:03.220
and it's like, yeah, there you go.

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:04.580
You could do whatever you want.

02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:06.180
It's like, oh, it's fine.

02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:06.980
We could do this.

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.420
It's fine to do that.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:09.860
No, it is not.

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:16.340
This is one of the reasons why I don't staff conventions anymore, because I can tell you

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:20.100
stories of things I have seen, I have heard and I'm like, you know what?

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:22.260
I this is something I cannot do.

02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:24.980
Nobody's holding the board accountable.

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:27.540
And that's your common denominator with the Activision story.

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:28.660
Right.

02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:35.460
But I will say the difference is that one person tried to basically fight the board.

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.540
And so I just can't do it.

02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.260
And I understand this all so much.

02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:45.460
And what bothers me the most is that you're the con chair.

02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:46.340
You're on the board.

02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:48.180
You are basically the head guy.

02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.820
And everybody else is like, yeah, no.

02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:58.900
I mean, one person harassed a friend of mine to the point where she will not attend the

02:06:58.900 --> 02:06:59.940
convention anymore.

02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:06.180
She filed multiple grievances and complaints because he was friends with people on the

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:06.660
board.

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:08.340
They went to deaf ears.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.900
And unfortunately, that's what it's going to take for the board to fight.

02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:18.980
It's like I said, and you agree when I said money, you said, uh huh.

02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:20.260
And that's what it's going to take.

02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:22.980
Lack of money to change the tone.

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:26.260
And that is the common denominator with the Activision thing.

02:07:26.260 --> 02:07:30.340
Now, of course, in the Activision thing, you also have a toxic, poisonous CEO who won't

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:32.180
get out of there and the board's protecting him.

02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:35.700
I mean, none of these people threaten to kill anyone, at least as far as I know.

02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:40.740
But my point is, is that it's going to take the shareholders starting to oust the board

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:46.100
members and holding those types of elections in order and as the only way that will happen

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:48.100
is if Activision continues to lose money.

02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:51.060
I do want to point out Activision is losing money this year.

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:56.740
If you look at their stock and this is beyond just that recent dip in this, I mean, that

02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.060
doesn't help, but this is beyond the recent Omnicron dip in the stock market.

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:08.900
This is Activision has been trending downward because this leak of stuff will not I guess

02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:13.220
that's not not the right way to put it, but this this toxic leak will not get plugged

02:08:13.220 --> 02:08:13.860
up.

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:15.540
Bobby Kotick is still there.

02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:24.020
And you know what, Rob, the sad part is, is that regardless of what's going on at Activision,

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:27.300
people are going to pick up and play the games because, oh, this is my game.

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:28.100
I want to play it.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:28.820
You shouldn't play.

02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:29.460
Let's go.

02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:29.940
I don't care.

02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.380
I want to play that game.

02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:36.020
Like I could tell you about issues with various conventions.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:43.620
There is one guy who runs multiple conventions and he is a known registered sex offender.

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:45.140
But you know what?

02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:51.300
People still go to his conventions because of their friends that are going, the guests

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:52.980
that are appearing and all that.

02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.940
And he has screwed the guests in the past.

02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.780
He has screwed the hotels in the past.

02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:02.020
He's not even allowed to be in certain hotels because he owes them money.

02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:02.820
But you know what?

02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:06.500
He continues to run these conventions and people will go.

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:11.620
It's like any reason to go to a convention equals to any reason to buy the game.

02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:17.060
I guarantee you Activision can have a fire sale on the latest Call of Duty and put it

02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:19.380
out and say it's $19.99.

02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:23.220
The sheer number of people that will go that will that will buy it.

02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:24.020
Just saying.

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:24.520
Sure.

02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:26.180
You know what, though?

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.580
I'm putting my foot down no more.

02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:29.700
Not on my watch.

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:30.740
I'm one person.

02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:34.180
Maybe I don't matter, but it's got to start somewhere.

02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.020
Dude, you matter.

02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:39.380
I have a friend who worked for Activision Blizzard.

02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:39.860
She was.

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:43.060
She did like she worked like on the board.

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:48.660
So she's told me some horror stories, you know, and we used to play Overwatch.

02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:52.580
No, I have I have not touched Overwatch since all of this happened.

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:53.540
And I'm like, you know what?

02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:59.140
I have plenty of other games that I can play in the meantime.

02:09:59.140 --> 02:09:59.640
Yep.

02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:06.980
I am perfectly content playing Powerwash Simulator over Diablo two until Bobby Kotick

02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:07.480
is handled.

02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:11.540
I just picked up I just picked up Xenoblade Chronicles.

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:13.940
I could start playing that and check it out and check that out.

02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:14.820
You know, that's a lot of fun.

02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:15.320
Yeah.

02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:15.820
Yeah.

02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:19.620
I just picked up Ghost of Tsushima directors cut from as well.

02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:21.700
I'm like, that's a I'll definitely you know.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.860
There's no shortage of games, people.

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.780
There's no shortage of games, people.

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:31.860
I mean, look, if I really want to if I really want to play something like Call of Duty,

02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.700
I'll go play Battlefield and Call of the Day.

02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:34.200
That's it.

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:39.540
Bobby Blackwell was pointing out Paladins versus Overwatch.

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:40.040
Why not?

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:44.660
Mike Deft in chat says Pokemon Unite to fill the salt in my life.

02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:51.940
West Buster says as a side note, since news of California's investigation broke this summer,

02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:55.380
ATVI has lost 30 percent of its value.

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:55.700
Yep.

02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:58.580
And also supports what you're saying is Xenoblade Chronicles is awesome.

02:10:58.580 --> 02:10:59.080
That's request.

02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:06.580
So I am not I'm not shedding a tear over this, you know, and the thing is,

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:14.660
I also have friends that work Activision Blizzard, and those are where my tears are going because

02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:19.940
I know they are they are victims trying to make a paycheck in this horrible situation

02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:23.540
that and I feel bad because I'm sitting here going, well, I'm boycott.

02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:29.940
But it just hit a point where I'm like, nothing else is working and the situation isn't changing.

02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:37.460
It has to it has to like Activision has to be hurt financially for the exactly to do

02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:41.700
fucking anything besides forming a committee to investigate themselves.

02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:46.420
Which is so transparent, I'm so glad people are seeing right through it,

02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:49.940
especially in the financial channels and calling them on their bullshit.

02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:52.420
It's just anyway.

02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:55.140
Yes. And Bobby Blackwell says not only are they getting a paycheck,

02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.940
those employees still really care about the worlds they are creating.

02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.340
Yes. And I cannot wait to experience them

02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:05.300
when Bobby Kotek is gone and that day is over due and counting.

02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:07.460
Exactly. Exactly.

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:10.420
Rama, anything else on your mind tonight before we wrap it up?

02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:13.060
One quick thing and I'm gonna get out of here.

02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.620
You ever see development?

02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:17.700
Oh, it's many times.

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.220
It's been a while, but yeah, of course.

02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:21.380
Multi pass.

02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:24.420
OK, for the high pass for the podcast listeners,

02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:26.980
he's holding up a multi pass on the camera there.

02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:32.260
So and it has a multi task and it has and it has my covid card in here.

02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:34.420
So I'm like a friend of mine was selling these.

02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:36.020
I'm like, I want one.

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:37.540
I'm like, give me one.

02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:40.500
I keep this at my desk.

02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.260
So I know because this week I am getting the booster shot.

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:45.540
So that's cute.

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:49.220
I love that the multi passes the covid that I just have the thing because they built it

02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.140
into iPhone where you can just bring up the bar code and everything is just right there,

02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:54.420
which I like.

02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:56.580
So I don't bother with my card anymore.

02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:59.220
So I just think it's something to have.

02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:00.420
So, you know, it is it is.

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:06.900
If assuming Dragon Con still mandates vaccine or prior test or whatever they do next year,

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:09.540
I will take a multi pass and have it in there and do it that way.

02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:13.780
That's that's what my friend puts him up for sale.

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:15.620
I will shoot all of y'all a message.

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.140
OK, sounds good.

02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:17.460
All right.

02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:18.740
Take care, Rama.

02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:19.620
Thanks so much for the call.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:20.180
Appreciate you.

02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:20.660
All right.

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:21.460
Take care, y'all.

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:21.960
Bye.

02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:23.460
All right.

02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:24.340
Oh, we have another.

02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:25.780
We got another call.

02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:26.500
Let's do it.

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:28.420
Let's just go right to another call.

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:29.540
Hi.

02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:30.820
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:31.320
Who's this?

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:38.580
This week, VX JasonXV calls into Orange Lounge Radio once again and extends his talking time

02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:39.080
total.

02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:42.500
We love hearing you talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:46.100
I remember when you were when we were in a situation, you had the ability to sit in on

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:48.820
episodes and always loved having you here, Jason.

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:50.980
And it's a pleasure to have you here tonight.

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:51.700
What's on your mind?

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:55.380
Oh, in the before times, as as they call it these days.

02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:56.100
Yeah, indeed.

02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:01.460
Have you have any of you watched Legends of the Hidden Temple?

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:04.660
Not the new one.

02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:07.220
Just the one back in the day movie.

02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:12.740
Also that which I only recently, I think, relearned about.

02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:17.140
But I was I was alluding to the game show series that started back up in the last what?

02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:18.900
Just last month, I think, or October.

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:19.700
That was last month.

02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.580
It's not December yet.

02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:25.780
No, my my friend Victoria from Shaking and Crying, that show that we had here,

02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:29.060
really wanted to audition for that with me.

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:30.180
And I wanted to do it, too.

02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:32.900
But it's just there was no way I was going to be able to get down to L.A. and do that.

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:33.700
I'll do all that stuff.

02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:35.940
But yeah, we would we would have been so good on that show.

02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:37.460
But is it adults now?

02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:39.140
It's yeah, it's adults.

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.380
It was it's a little strange to me because the casting call that I saw

02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:47.700
said like eighteen to twenty ones, like like sub twenty fives.

02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:50.500
But there have definitely been older groups like there were

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.100
last weeks or two episodes ago, two episodes ago.

02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:54.600
Definitely.

02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.140
I've watched the whole series so far.

02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:57.700
The whole season.

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:02.740
Don't worry.

02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:06.660
There's a minute more in the temple and people are still fucking everything up.

02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:08.100
So it's not just kids that are stupid.

02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:13.300
It's a little it's a little weird because the casting call that I saw was early 20 somethings.

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:17.060
Yet two episodes ago, I think it was the Silver Snakes, one of the teams,

02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:21.620
the teams that was at the Temple Run, both of them were in the original airing of the show.

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:24.660
And it's been 22 years alone since the show.

02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:25.140
More than that.

02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.340
It's been like 25 years.

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:26.840
Yeah.

02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.940
So I don't know if like I don't know.

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:32.500
I don't know anything about how L.A. Hollywood TV shows work.

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.660
I don't know if there were multiple casting calls.

02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:36.980
I don't know if it was just like apply anyways.

02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:38.580
And maybe the producer will accept you.

02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.420
I don't know how you are correct.

02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:42.100
They're putting their feelers out everywhere.

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:43.220
They have casting calls here.

02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.660
They post on social media.

02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:47.700
They probably have recruiters that go out and try to find people.

02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:48.420
It's it's all of it.

02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:52.900
They probably they probably had contact information for past contestants.

02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:55.940
And they probably looked that way to try to find them.

02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:56.580
I bet they did.

02:15:57.140 --> 02:15:59.780
But yeah, no, I know that it's on the CW, right?

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:04.740
And I'm assuming you can watch in their app or something like that or maybe one of those things.

02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:08.580
That's pretty cool that I keep I keep forgetting that it's back.

02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:11.300
I saw a commercial for it at random.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:12.980
But yeah, I just I keep forgetting it's back.

02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:13.620
But that's so cool.

02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:21.620
It's these these last many years, adult grown up, much more mature.

02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:23.700
Jason, relatively speaking, has come out.

02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:30.580
It's it's just been really, really weird to me because like I think about all the conflicts

02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:35.060
I used to have with people, just like social situation and conflicts and those sorts of things.

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:41.140
And the rationales that I gave at the time, the times that I know I didn't have a rationale

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.660
and I made shit up because I wasn't going to give up my core point.

02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:48.660
And then I kind of take a step back and think about that in conflicts in general of things

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:54.420
of things that don't have like, you know, an obvious aggressor damage detriment,

02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:54.980
that sort of thing.

02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.260
But just just social strife.

02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:01.140
The thing that you hear about more often than not, then, you know, the worst of physical

02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:02.420
examples and everything else.

02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:07.940
And it's just kind of like, you know, you know, complaints between you and your parents

02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:12.580
about your parents believing this way and telling you why, but you feeling differently,

02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:14.980
but not having the life experience to really talk about yet.

02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:21.540
And it's just it's so many different and annoying things to think about that.

02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:28.500
Accept yourself for who you are, but you probably have to be this different way in this different

02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:29.140
situation.

02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:36.980
You know, lean into the I I've used the I have a face for radio joke against myself

02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:38.340
and I still kind of feel that way.

02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:41.460
You know, lean into it because that's who I am.

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:43.860
But there's going to be limits to it.

02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:47.540
And radio, you know, audio only only goes so far these days.

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:52.740
And this channel is one of the very few situations I can think of any other channel and anybody

02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:55.140
else, anybody else's production that does something like that.

02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:59.540
Independence Day had had its sequel.

02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:03.860
Jeez, it was either 2016 or 2018 or something like that.

02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:09.220
And I finally watched it a couple of weeks ago and I thought to myself, is this movie

02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.540
terrible or am I just an adult now?

02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:16.420
Because I loved the first one, but the second one was just goofy as hell.

02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:18.980
And I don't know.

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:20.660
I don't know what to blame it on.

02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:21.060
I don't.

02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:24.180
I didn't look up if it's the same director, the same producer, the same writer.

02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:25.620
I'm pretty sure it is.

02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:26.660
Rob something.

02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:27.620
Rod or Rob something.

02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:30.980
Or if it's just there.

02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:32.660
Thank you.

02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:33.300
You nailed it.

02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:39.300
It's the I have this conversation with myself over and over and over about social situations.

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.500
And it's there's there's never going to be a resolution.

02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:45.060
There's never going to be one single answer that applies in every case.

02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:50.820
And it's just a really difficult topic to I don't want to use the word agonize over,

02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:53.220
but the only term that's coming to mind is agonize over.

02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:59.380
Um, I don't know where to begin.

02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:02.900
Um, yeah, there's I thought about caveatting this.

02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:06.580
I'm going to rely on you and your ability to make sense of my rambling, not lunacy.

02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:09.140
It makes sense, but it's also kind of interesting.

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:12.340
All of those little like lemons that life throws at you.

02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:15.700
We just had an extensive conversation about something I'm going through.

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:18.020
There wasn't something I was facing when I was 21.

02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:22.180
And, you know, kind of like a lot of the changes that that's caused in my own life.

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:25.380
And so, you know, sometimes there isn't.

02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:29.940
You know, those changes and those things, there's not a lot you can do about it.

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:34.580
You know, whether it be genetic disposition or just the fact that bad things happened

02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:36.660
to people all the time.

02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:38.660
And it's just the way that it is.

02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:42.020
The only thing you kind of can control is how do you sort of respond?

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:44.580
To those types of situations, right?

02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:47.220
Yeah, that that's all you really can do.

02:19:48.100 --> 02:19:54.260
But I think it's nice that these sorts of comfort foods like classic video games,

02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:59.140
like a remasters of classic video games, even like, oh, no, did we lose Jason?

02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:01.220
No, we lost Jamie.

02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:01.620
That's weird.

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:01.860
All right.

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:02.580
She should be back.

02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:03.300
That's odd.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:05.140
Oh, this is a weird little hiccup.

02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:10.900
Um, uh, but we have like, you know, those types of comfort food types of things.

02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:15.860
The old game shows that come back again to sort of remind us of those better times,

02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:19.860
even if the situation now might be different.

02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.420
For example, if you think about it, because of what I'm dealing, you know,

02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:26.260
I love those types of reality shows, like The Survivor and Big Brother.

02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:27.780
And people have joked to me that.

02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:33.140
Sorry, I heard a very strange noise outside.

02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:33.780
Sorry, guys.

02:20:33.780 --> 02:20:35.940
So joys of doing things live in your house.

02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:39.220
Um, anyway, um, where was I?

02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:39.620
Oh, yes.

02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:43.140
Um, I love those types of shows like Survivor and Big Brother and so forth.

02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:45.140
Um, and people say, oh, you should go on Survivor.

02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:45.940
You should go on Survivor.

02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:51.460
The reality is kind of sitting in now that they would never touch me with my condition.

02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:52.760
Yeah.

02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:55.140
I'm never going to get put on that show now.

02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:58.340
Um, and that's just age.

02:20:58.340 --> 02:20:58.980
I say that.

02:20:58.980 --> 02:20:59.940
I say that not.

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:04.100
I say that not to insult you, of course, but the nature that all of those are the young,

02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:04.660
hot.

02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:05.940
Well, that I know of.

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:08.020
They have 40 and 50 somethings that go on that show.

02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:14.900
They usually try to diversify the age a little bit, but there are more of the good looking

02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:16.980
model types that are recruited from bars.

02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:18.340
Yes, absolutely.

02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.740
My chances would be lower, but not gone.

02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:23.060
And now it's like that's never going to happen.

02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:28.420
But I have ways to play it online when I have the time.

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:32.980
I have other ways to, you know, kind of participate and so forth.

02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:39.700
My point is, is that, you know, the situations will change and it's how you respond to them

02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:42.500
that truly is you and your character and so forth.

02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:49.860
And sometimes it's neat to revisit things from a different time because it not only

02:21:49.860 --> 02:21:54.100
necessarily reminds you about thing, but it reminds you of that simpler time when your

02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:56.740
problems didn't seem as bad as they are today.

02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:01.460
Or maybe the opposite in some cases, depending on what it is.

02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:02.600
Yeah.

02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:10.500
Yeah, that topic just spirals endlessly because it's also like finding your people to enjoy

02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:12.820
it with and having to deal with the people that don't.

02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:14.660
That's huge, yes.

02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:18.100
No, finding your people is so important.

02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:18.740
It really is.

02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:19.460
Yeah.

02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:20.580
Thank God for the internet.

02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:26.980
You folks, I agree with you in opinion when we were talking about, when you were talking

02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:32.660
about the Mass Effect TV show, that a unique story is more preferable to, hey, let's take

02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:34.260
the game and put it on TV.

02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:38.820
The game was an experience and people, it is very, games by nature being interactive

02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:41.060
is very highly personal to oneself.

02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:48.340
And so to retell that story, yeah, is probably, you're not going to satisfy everyone, but

02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:54.660
picking one person's story is probably going to satisfy the fewest of them all in the grand

02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:55.380
scheme of things.

02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:59.940
I like remasters because I know the technology changes.

02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:01.460
I don't have a lot of older devices.

02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:03.540
I like the ability to have it again.

02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:10.180
Rebuying it, that's a little difficult in the era of cloud gaming and I've always been

02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:11.300
an emulating person.

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:16.660
So with the official blessing of that and cloud gaming and everything else, opportunities

02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:19.860
for preservation and back catalog stuff is happening even more.

02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:27.380
Yeah, I think the summary of everything that I'm getting at is that everything is fucking

02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:28.260
difficult.

02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:29.620
Weave your way through it.

02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:33.700
Do what you enjoy at no detrimental expense to others.

02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:39.300
Don't be a Roblox harasser fucking ass hat for the subs.

02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:42.820
How about if people just not be twats?

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.220
It would be lovely.

02:23:45.860 --> 02:24:01.220
Yeah, do what you love and solicit the help of either your social circle, a guidance counselor,

02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:07.700
mental health therapist, whatever the desired level is for seemingly irresolvable conflicts.

02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:12.580
There are the things out there for you to express yourself in the way that you want

02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:17.060
to do and there are the people to help you through it when it becomes difficult and you

02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:18.740
want to keep going down that road.

02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:22.020
There are people that can help you with that and you should absolutely avail yourself of

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.180
them as difficult as that may be in and of itself as well.

02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:28.740
I think we'll leave it on that note.

02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:29.540
Thank you, Jason.

02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:32.500
I really appreciate the call and the introspection tonight.

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:39.860
That oh so happy thought in the post Thanksgiving still burn off and December ramp up and...

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:45.540
It's it's necessary just because it's just because it's I don't know what the right word

02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:49.780
would be difficult to talk about doesn't mean it shouldn't be so.

02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:50.660
Oh, absolutely.

02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:51.620
A hundred percent.

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:52.120
Absolutely.

02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:53.220
All right.

02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:54.340
Take care of my friend.

02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:57.140
We'll we'll hear from you next week for sure, at least in the intro.

02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:59.780
But I hope we talk again on these calls again real soon.

02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:01.060
Absolutely.

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:01.860
Hear me later.

02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:02.100
All right.

02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:02.660
Take care, buddy.

02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:04.020
All right.

02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:06.820
And you will hear Jason later in the outro of the show, that's for sure.

02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:10.980
OK, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight and we are about to wrap up.

02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:17.700
However, before we get there, I do I solicited tweets tonight and Jason brought up emulation

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:18.980
and I was like, oh, yeah, we had a tweet.

02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:19.620
I want to get to it.

02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:23.300
So we had a tweet tonight from at Garth the Wolf.

02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:26.340
And if you want to follow us on OLR at OLR is the place to do it.

02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:33.860
Who tweeted us a potential topic for tonight, saying Nintendo's N64 emulation for their

02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:37.060
online service is shoddy at best.

02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:41.700
Ocarina of Time is plagued with lag issues and degraded visuals with similar issues in

02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:44.820
Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64.

02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:45.460
Thoughts?

02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:47.140
You think Nintendo will patch this?

02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:52.420
Um, no, I think they're under pressure to I I'm a little less cynical.

02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:55.540
I think they will eventually, especially if they want people to renew that thing in a

02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:56.100
year.

02:25:56.100 --> 02:26:01.140
Um, but boy, boy, did a lot of people learn a lesson about paying for something for a

02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:03.300
year on name alone.

02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:06.100
And boy, was that a tough lesson to learn?

02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:07.300
I didn't get it.

02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:08.740
And I certainly have.

02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:13.060
But when I see tweets like that and feedback about how the emulation really in that I'm

02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:14.820
certainly not motivated to get it now.

02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:22.900
So I just I don't know how many cynical people like me are truly out there and how many people

02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:26.900
bought it on name alone and the promise of all this other stuff, or maybe the Animal

02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:31.140
Crossing DLC, if you look at it, really did kind of enhance the value if that was something

02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.100
you were into.

02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:33.460
So there's a variety of reasons.

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:40.100
But yeah, I think Nintendo will be pressured to patch it, but they're certainly in no hurry.

02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:43.620
In my opinion, they've got a year to do it because they got a bunch of people already

02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:44.820
pony up a year.

02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.060
So don't expect it tomorrow.

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:48.500
But if it does drop tomorrow, great.

02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:52.260
All right.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:54.260
Thank you for the tweets at O L R.

02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:55.860
I'll try to incorporate more.

02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:58.900
So I know you guys tag us and I don't always read them on the show because I forget on

02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:01.540
Sunday night, but I'll try to remind myself to check that more often if you guys want

02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:04.740
to send us some lovely tweets at O L R for now, though.

02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:05.940
Hey, we're two and a half hours in.

02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:08.500
I thought this would be a shorter show tonight, and it's kind of a normal length show.

02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:13.460
We just had a lot of good, good, good things to chew on here at the table after Thanksgiving.

02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:18.500
So I appreciate you guys being here and going through the show with us all.

02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.340
I do want to check real quick and ask for any last minute stories from my co-host.

02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:25.220
I'm not expecting any this week, but not for me.

02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:31.300
OK, there's the I guess project that's called Destination Home.

02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:36.740
They've been working on this project for years now to reattempt to bring PlayStation Home

02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:42.900
back, and apparently they're still making some more progress on that.

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:48.660
They have released a teaser trailer showing some of the stuff that I mean, they've kind

02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:50.660
of brought back some of the spaces and everything.

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:56.260
So if Sony shuts it down, it'll tell you something.

02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:01.140
I'm surprised they haven't tried to like spin it off to make like, you know, their

02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:07.060
own thing instead of bringing PlayStation Home back, just like make a new thing that's

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:11.380
not PlayStation Home, like VR chat and release it on PlayStation, the ultimate gag.

02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:15.300
Yeah, it's like, all right.

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.060
Are they gagging?

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:22.100
That's going to bring our show to a close for tonight.

02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:24.900
Thank you guys for listening to our show.

02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:28.660
Whether you were here live or you downloaded us on the podcast feed through your favorite

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:31.380
player like iTunes, Spotify, whatever it was.

02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:33.780
Thank you so much for being a part of the show this week.

02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:34.900
Appreciate y'all.

02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.860
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:38.980
Help us spread the word.

02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:43.300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to add to the

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:44.100
conversation.

02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:49.780
So a nice five star review on one of those sites, a social media post hosting here at

02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:50.180
Twitch.

02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:53.380
I mean, you kind of have to do it live on Sunday night, but hey, we'll take anything

02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:55.220
we can get that helps spread the word.

02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:56.900
I really, really appreciate that.

02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:59.380
The Vaga Network shop is currently down for maintenance.

02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:02.500
We didn't do a lot of work on it this week because of Thanksgiving.

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:06.180
We'll be honest, but hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we'll have some more progress

02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:09.860
on that front for you guys, especially if anybody's wanting holiday merch.

02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:11.860
We'll try to get that up pretty soon for you guys.

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:14.740
Otherwise, that's all I've got.

02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:16.580
Thank you guys again for being here tonight.

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:19.140
We will be back next week to do it all again.

02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:20.820
It's time to get the final thoughts.

02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:25.860
I will start with Dark Sakura because I know she's going to set up for her post stream

02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:27.220
over at her channel.

02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:33.780
I have a new intro video that I managed to finish right at the start of Orange House

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:39.940
Radio and some temporary AFK and thank you things.

02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:44.500
I've been really working, trying to get a little bit more skill in Final Cut Pro.

02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:46.900
And I think I've done something pretty nice.

02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:51.540
Maybe I have to master the music a little bit better in logic, but I think doing okay.

02:29:52.100 --> 02:30:01.060
But this is the second week now of weaning off my meds and I am not a pleasant person

02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:03.140
to be around at a busy IKEA.

02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:03.940
We'll leave it at that.

02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:05.940
All right.

02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:09.700
Well, have a good night, Dark Sakura, and bully some survivors for us.

02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:11.300
Later taters.

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:11.800
All right.

02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:15.780
We will go now to Loki with his final thought.

02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:17.140
Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?

02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:22.980
My final thought is I need to get my new video out and then I got to figure out what to do

02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:27.380
between now and whenever the new series starts, because I don't know.

02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:31.940
I'm trying to get them to nail down timing for that, but it's going to be like an awkward

02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:33.140
couple of weeks or so.

02:30:33.940 --> 02:30:36.420
It's all up to figure something out until then.

02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:37.380
All right.

02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:40.820
And my final thought, I will be back streaming tomorrow.

02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:44.420
I haven't streamed in a couple of weeks, but I will get back into the post work.

02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:48.180
Obviously, y'all know things have been going on, but I'm going to get back into the post

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:49.940
work habit of streaming.

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:54.820
So I'll see you guys around 4.15-4.30 Pacific tomorrow at my channel, Rob Roberts.

02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:58.100
I'm going to be playing some No Man's Sky, continuing on the first expedition.

02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:02.500
And I'm already about halfway through it, so I'll kind of pick it up and answer any

02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:06.180
questions for those of you guys that are starting it the best I can and so forth.

02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:07.780
So I'll see you guys tomorrow.

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:12.820
Also, I want to say thanks again for those downloading the show, listening to the show,

02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:14.100
supporting the show.

02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:14.980
It means a lot.

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:18.580
And thanks to the emails and the kind words and the love.

02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:22.500
I could go on and on, but here we come, year 20.

02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:25.300
We're only about a month away in episode 900, if you can believe it.

02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:27.460
Only a few weeks away.

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:29.540
Have a great week, everybody.

02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:31.540
Happy Hanukkah to those that celebrate.

02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:33.140
Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.

02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:35.860
Here comes December, believe it or not.

02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:39.940
Get vaccinated so that this Omnicron thing doesn't become an issue.

02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:40.420
Good Lord.

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:40.660
All right.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:41.540
Have a good night, everybody.

02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:41.780
Bye.

02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:13.780
See you next week.

02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:42.260
Bye.
