1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
It's another week in a very wild gaming world with all manner of continuing stories,

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,640
new rumors, new deals, old new deals, and plenty more.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,760
My favorite headline?

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,440
Sony teasing that they're not out of the mobile space yet, but they are back in the

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,240
position of having to play catch up.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,160
We hope the holiday was great for those who celebrate, and for those who didn't, we

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,440
hope the sales were helpful.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,760
But they're over yet, of course.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,200
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki with this week's gaming

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,520
news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:46,840
Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,400
gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,920
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 893 of our

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,760
show for this November the 28th of 2021.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,840
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined live on this Sunday evening post-Thanksgiving and

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,540
first night of Hanukkah with my co-host.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,960
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Sup.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm okay.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Happy Hanukkah.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Happy Hanukkah.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Yeah.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,800
How was your Thanksgiving festivities and celebration?

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
It was all right.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Dan got a kidney stone.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Oh, no.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,680
Oh, I know we were texting about that, so I was confirmed that's what it was?

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Oh, bummer.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Pretty much.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
I mean, and I think he passed it because he doesn't hurt anymore, so...

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Well, that's good.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Yeah.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah.

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,240
So I was taking care of him, and then I had to go to Ikea today, which makes me regret

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,520
every single choice in my life that led up to that moment.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
That's like a kidney stone of the soul.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,000
Well hello, Tech Master Loki, there with the witty little one-liners we're used to, and

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,680
I hope you're doing well as well.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,360
Happy Hanukkah to you and the Mrs. as well, Loki.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Thank you.

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,160
So, I gotta go back to Dark Sakura for a minute with the whole Ikea thing.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,800
Did you at least get to reward yourself with meatballs or something lemon berry flavored?

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
No.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
No.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Oh, that's a question.

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,320
Because the eatery thing, they didn't even have cinnamon rolls ready.

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
What?

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
What?

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,360
And I was like, so I made another mistake.

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,320
I went to Taco Bell for the first time in four years.

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Oh, boy.

53
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Yeah.

54
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
And...

55
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah.

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,680
I ate half of the quesadilla.

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,920
And I further regretted my life's decisions that led up to that particular moment.

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,960
I gave the rest of it to Dan, who's like, okay, I'm fine.

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Great.

60
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
Del Taco is far superior.

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
Let it be known.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
You know, the supply chain issues are very serious when Ikea does not have cinnamon rolls

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
on time.

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
This is like...

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,040
It wasn't that they had just been sold out and they had another batch baking and I didn't

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
want to wait for it.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,220
Going to our chat, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice

68
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,020
of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
That's V-O-G network.

70
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,480
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,880
Hey, folks listening on the podcast feed, consider following us on Twitch.

72
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
We really would appreciate it.

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
We do some special stuff outside Sunday nights once in a while.

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
I know we have a special coming up soon.

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
We'll talk a little bit about that later.

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
But SHO 100 Mountain Chat says, oh, I like Ikea, but your soul is ripped from you every

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,320
moment you're there.

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,800
Never feel more drained than being in an Ikea for two hours.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Yeah.

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,240
I get claustrophobia because it's hard to find your way out.

81
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,480
That's the thing about Ikea.

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,300
You can literally get lost in there.

83
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,960
And it's a little disorienting.

84
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Ugh.

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,940
Um, Loki, how are you?

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
How was your Thanksgiving?

87
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Uh, busy.

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:47,280
I just, you know, uh, we went over to my mama's house and had dinner there and just been playing

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,760
and you're an entertainer for the kids the entire week.

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Well, it's an important role that somebody's got to do it, but they go back to school tomorrow,

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
right?

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Yes, thankfully.

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
There's that.

94
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,320
Oh, you had, didn't you have the week off to work on your, uh, like videos and stuff?

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,400
Yeah, I did.

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,480
So I have been still working on that actually.

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,040
Um, cause so next week on Tuesday actually is one 18.

98
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,680
That's when the new update comes out for Minecraft.

99
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,920
And so around that time, the servers are going to be resetting.

100
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:28,040
So you know, our server on a collusion, I'm, I know they're talking about it.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,820
Must be in another chat other than the discord I'm in, cause I don't see much conversation

102
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
going on.

103
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:41,100
Um, with NerdCraft, I know that they're talking about restarting soon as well.

104
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,760
So it's basically time to kind of wrap up my series.

105
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,320
And so I've been working on the last, um, episode of my series.

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,720
So I finished my builds.

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:59,520
I, um, I've been touring the entire server, trying to figure out who everyone's bases

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,640
belong to, um, because we didn't have a really good system for that.

109
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,440
So I've been just trying to like forensically figure out who's base belongs to what and

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,360
get like some shots of them and like trying to put that all together.

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,720
So that's, what's been taken up a ton of my time recently.

112
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,020
Cause there's like so many, we had 70 people on the server, like whitelisted on there.

113
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,640
Not necessarily that they all played or played for a long time, but there's bases everywhere

114
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,960
and it's hard to know what belongs to what.

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,240
So I've been just doing my best to try to capture all of them, but I'm sure I'm going

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,880
to miss something, but yeah.

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,440
So that's what I've been working on recently is just that I've got, like, so all my builds

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
are done now.

119
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,560
Um, I just need to actually, I need to film my, the last part of my builds.

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm not necessarily doing a time-lapse cause I don't have time for that, but just capture

121
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,960
like kind of all the stuff that I built and everything and then, um, just wrap it up.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,720
So probably have one more episode left and that's it for this, this season.

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
Looking forward to that.

124
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,400
Um, and, uh, next week is a pretty big week in gaming for us here at OLR cause you've

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,160
got Minecraft, you got a big patch in Minecraft for that and all the content you do, uh, Final

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,240
Fantasy XIV Heavensward early access this Friday.

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,000
So by this time next week, I'll finally be playing a new XIV expansion.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Very exciting for me.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm so ready for it.

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,940
Yes, you might recall, we talked a couple of weeks ago about how it was delayed by two

131
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,160
whole weeks.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,600
So they're really putting the finishing touches on it now.

133
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
So we're in that period where I should be playing Endwalker, but I'm not, but that's

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,760
okay because I'm not a dick when it comes to delayed games.

135
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
It is what it is.

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,720
Uh, so, but it'll be, it'll be nice to finally be playing that and, uh, well hopefully Dark

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,880
Soccer gets something too.

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,200
Have they, uh, have they announced the release date for that cool new killer, the artist

139
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
in Dead by Daylight?

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Is that Tuesday?

141
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I think like tomorrow.

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Okay.

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
So everybody's getting something.

144
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah.

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,760
You get DLC and you get DLC and you get DLC.

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,920
I also do have Final Fantasy XIV, you know.

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Oh, that's true.

148
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,040
I just, I know you, you don't put in as many hours as I do.

149
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah.

150
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,720
I think it's really, I think it's really cool of them to make Prince a new killer in Dead

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
by Daylight.

152
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I mean, that to be really interesting.

153
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Oh yeah.

154
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
The artist.

155
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Yes.

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,680
This is the polar opposite of Prince.

157
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,340
Although I wouldn't mind a killer with like a guitar type of thing.

158
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,560
I don't know how that would work, but I would, we already have Kate and she's a killer enough.

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,200
Oh yeah.

160
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
All Kate's are toxic.

161
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
All right.

162
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
All Kate's are toxic.

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,920
Anyhow, we'll talk more about the games we play in a little bit, but first I want to

164
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,960
get into our kickoff topic tonight.

165
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm going to be honest.

166
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,680
It's probably going to be a shorter show here tonight just because with Thanksgiving going

167
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,200
on in the U S and I hope everybody out there had a great Thanksgiving, whatever you ended

168
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
up doing.

169
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
We had a very small gathering because I didn't talk about mine.

170
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,320
We had a very small gathering with my dad.

171
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,560
It's literally just the three of us, but how's your dad doing?

172
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
He's good.

173
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,400
It's really nice to see him and spend a little time with him and he's, he's had some ups

174
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,020
and I guess I'll just say a friend of his passed away and you know, it's just, it, it's

175
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,400
rough when, you know, well, how do I phrase this?

176
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,480
Like, you know, when you watch those older than you, especially in their eighties, like

177
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,280
my dad is where it's like my friends are passing away, like that's just really tough to watch

178
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
and so forth.

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,800
Another one of his friends is in a home and dad, if you're watching, I'm sorry, but I'm

180
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
thinking you know, it does, it does gets worse and I absolutely feel for it.

181
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,600
I remember my grandmom losing a lot of friends, so, so, but I was sometimes my dad watches,

182
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,040
so I'm sorry if you had to hear that, but I just means I'm thinking of my dad and I'm

183
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,320
really treasuring the holiday time that we do get to spend together and so forth.

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,960
He will pop in on his iPad once in a while, so I want to make sure I say that as well.

185
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
As well you should.

186
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Yes, as well I should.

187
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,800
So where was I going with that?

188
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,240
So oh yes, so I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving as well, although I know we do.

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,200
We are fortunate enough to have international listeners.

190
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,960
We have people in Canada, Mexico, Australia, all the various countries in Europe, all over.

191
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,820
We have listeners everywhere around the globe and we're very thankful for that.

192
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,240
So I know not everybody had Thanksgiving, but I hope you had a great week and everybody's

193
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,100
starting to get Black Friday for whatever crazy capitalist reasons.

194
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,280
So if that's a thing you're into, I hope you got some good deals.

195
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,160
I know Cyber Monday coming up is a big thing as well.

196
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I suppose Steam sales are something, you know, or whatever online shop you choose to go to.

197
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm sure if no one special was in chat right now, he'd be reminding us, oh, there's these

198
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,600
other stores too, not just Steam.

199
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,400
But you know, with all those online sales, I think it's pretty hard to resist a lot of

200
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,780
great deals in gaming right now.

201
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,520
So I hope you're finding some good deals wherever you are throughout the world.

202
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,320
And if you see some good deals on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, let me know, because that Amazon

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,900
one sold out before I could get one, although a good tip from Bobby's show, because we do

204
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,160
tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

205
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,760
Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.

206
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,000
And Bobby was saying on his show tonight that, hey, if you can't find an ultimate Game Pass

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,920
Ultimate card, get an Xbox Live Gold card if you see a good deal, because those convert

208
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,240
at about a third, because they're about a third of the price.

209
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,120
So like if you get a year of gold, it'll convert to like four months of ultimate.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,680
So yeah, if I find a good deal for that, heck yeah, I would do that as well.

211
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,660
Anyhow, I want to here at the top of the show, get into our kickoff topic, which goes back

212
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,080
to our roots a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio and a little company we've really followed

213
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
their up and downs over the years.

214
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,300
And that's a company called Harmonix.

215
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,340
And I talk about the ups.

216
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,660
I remember, and I'm sure Dark Soccer and Loki remember fondly when Harmonix was a vendor

217
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:56,760
in Kensho Hall at E3 that was showing off their guitars that they were making for import

218
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,660
Japanese games like Guitar Freaks.

219
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,660
But these guitars had five buttons on them for some reason that we didn't know, because

220
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,660
if you didn't know the Japanese Guitar Freaks game, they only use three buttons.

221
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
And we always, why are there five buttons?

222
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,540
And of course, we found out years later, oh, Harmonix got into bigger and better things.

223
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,880
They had some downs when they published in the groove.

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
And that's no shit.

225
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,120
You know, we had Kyle on the show years ago and, you know, we talked out a lot of our,

226
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,700
you know, kind of things we can see on the back of Harmonix published in the groove.

227
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
If I remember right.

228
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

229
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I'm always positive.

230
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,500
I thought that was Red Octane that did that.

231
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,100
Am I confusing Harmonix and Red Octane?

232
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
I sure am.

233
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,420
I think you're confusing Red Octane with them.

234
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,140
Yeah, Red Octane published in the groove.

235
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,540
I sure am.

236
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,740
And I was thinking, why am I confusing them?

237
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,140
Did they work together on something else?

238
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
They must have.

239
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,100
Oh, boy, my grandpa games kicking in.

240
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,500
They had to have collaborated on something because I remember associating this.

241
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,740
Oh, it was it was OK.

242
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:02,620
I was it was Guitar Hero because Red Octane did those original peripherals for the harmonix

243
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,820
game.

244
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
That part.

245
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,500
That's where I'm bleeding it together there.

246
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah.

247
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,540
Bobby Blackwell says Red Octane did the hardware.

248
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Harmonix did the software.

249
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
OK, put very so.

250
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,780
OK, so I'm not completely off base and just a little.

251
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Yeah.

252
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,780
For the original.

253
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,860
This was before Activision or any of that stuff.

254
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
Yeah.

255
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,740
So anyway, so harmonix, then, of course, their big breakthrough stuff was on the PlayStation

256
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
two.

257
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,420
They had frequency and amplitude.

258
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,060
And then they got into, if I remember right, karaoke revolution and some of those, I think

259
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,940
the first karaoke revolution was harmonix developed.

260
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
Right.

261
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,540
I know Konami published it, but I think the early ones were done by them and they they

262
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,540
did a lot.

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,180
So, OK, thank you.

264
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,220
Bobby says, yes, Activision bought Red Octane, who had the Guitar Hero IP, which is why harmonix

265
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,820
was bought by MTV and did rock band.

266
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
That's how that all went down.

267
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
That whole thing.

268
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
Thank you.

269
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
OK.

270
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
So I was only a little crazy.

271
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:10,220
But harmonix, obviously, you know, we have been following whether correctly or not for

272
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,380
the past many, many years of this show.

273
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:20,820
I remember when Guitar Hero first came out, you guys were on the news about it.

274
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,940
I wasn't because I couldn't be there that day.

275
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,880
I think that clip is still on YouTube somewhere.

276
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,780
Is that where the Loki it's no, no, no.

277
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,140
That is not where the Loki it's so much fun clip comes from.

278
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,320
That was a different that was the one I was there for when they talked about podcasting

279
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
and we were in it.

280
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,540
But there's that there's a clip out there because they went to Jamie's house.

281
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
You remember this?

282
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,040
And they did the Guitar Hero interview and you guys got to play it.

283
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
And it was on the news and all that stuff.

284
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,280
So that was cool.

285
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
And then that's pretty fun.

286
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah.

287
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah.

288
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,480
It was it was it was nice when people gave a shit about what we had to say.

289
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,600
But harmonix, you know, they've they've had some ups and downs.

290
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,360
They developed some pretty cool stuff, you know, in VR.

291
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
But then not everything took off.

292
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,380
Like they tried to do a music game shooter that didn't end up get really taken up off

293
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,440
the ground.

294
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,920
I personally was not a fan of the Kickstarter frequency game.

295
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,720
I know other people were.

296
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,640
I still wanted to see harmonix do very well.

297
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, and then some could argue they have done very well.

298
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,360
They have they have been sold.

299
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,080
This week is the news is that Epic has purchased harmonix.

300
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,440
And it actually goes a step further because we know exactly why Epic bought harmonix,

301
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,800
because it actually says in a statement that the Fortnite folks put out or Epic put out

302
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,360
is that harmonix will continue to support the existing slate of games.

303
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,000
So there will still be rock band stuff.

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
There will still be Fuser stuff.

305
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,180
And anything that's still on Steam will be there.

306
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:57,580
But Epic and harmonix will now be collaborating on music based enhancements for Fortnite,

307
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,220
which at first glance, you probably go, what the fuck?

308
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,060
Fortnite is a is a shooty shooty bang bang game.

309
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,260
But of course, you might recall about six or seven weeks here ago on the show, maybe

310
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
longer.

311
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,180
Time is a construct.

312
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,020
So we were talking about the Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite.

313
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,640
And I was mentioning how, you know, considering Fortnite has this reputation as battle royale

314
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,520
shooty shooty bang bang.

315
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,540
This Ariana Grande concert was actually one of the neater things that got me to kind of

316
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,180
turn my head and pay attention to what Fortnite was doing, because it essentially was an interactive

317
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,840
music video is what they did.

318
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,180
And it just kind of used the Fortnite engine and the Fortnite world to kind of do that.

319
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,220
So when you look at something like that, and then you think, oh, harmonix is going

320
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,140
to be working with music based stuff.

321
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:55,500
I also think about Fusor and how, you know, Fusor and its predecessor drop mix the in

322
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,500
person game, how those two were really good at like blending music together and letting

323
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,460
you do your own type of musical type of experience like, you know, the the music that you end

324
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,980
up making in Fusor is kind of rad.

325
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,740
Like it's fun like to play with those old songs, right?

326
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,860
So to think that some of that could be what Fortnite, I mean, we don't know exactly what

327
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,940
they are doing for Fortnite, but it could be something along those lines where you're

328
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,960
making the own your own soundtrack to your own experience.

329
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,820
And possibly as people are building their own worlds and, you know, doing the things

330
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,140
that they're doing in Fortnite besides just battle royale, maybe folks are going to be

331
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,700
able to leverage harmonic types of tools, harmonix types of tools to build their own

332
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,980
soundtracks and musical experiences and build their own Ariana Grande concerts within Fortnite.

333
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,540
That's kind of what I take from this announcement.

334
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I don't know.

335
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,180
Loki, what did you think about the whole thing?

336
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,580
I mean, it's just.

337
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm glad, you know, honestly, I'm kind of glad that someone bought them because, like,

338
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,340
I don't know what they've been doing recently.

339
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,700
I don't know if they would have the financial backing to last much longer.

340
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,380
I mean, it just doesn't seem like that they're kind of the heyday harmonics that we used

341
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
to know.

342
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,540
So it'd be good to have the financial backing of Epic and hopefully Epic just lets them

343
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,100
kind of do what they want to do and be creative, kind of like how they've done with like, oh,

344
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,540
gosh, Rocket League and that kind of stuff where they own them, but they're kind of doing

345
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,900
their own thing.

346
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,700
So I'm curious to see what they kind of do with that, because, you know, Harmonics is

347
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,060
a very creative company.

348
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,300
And, you know, they've been doing a lot of creative things.

349
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,340
Chat would like to remind you Fuser is a recent release, but I will give you the fact that

350
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,540
Fuser was essentially a port of drop mix, you know, of sorts.

351
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,100
But anyway, just to be fair, they have been putting out things recently.

352
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Right.

353
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Yeah.

354
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,340
And I know they have, but I don't think they've been like wildly successful, like, say, Rock

355
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,780
Band was or something like that.

356
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,780
I mean, sure.

357
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Sure.

358
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Probably not necessarily.

359
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Nothing's going to be.

360
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
Yeah, right.

361
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
Exactly.

362
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,820
So I would say, though, it's good to see that they have a financial backing of a company

363
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
like that.

364
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,940
Hopefully that allows them to be able to make some of these things that they haven't been

365
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
able to get off the ground.

366
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,180
We don't have to do any more kickstarters for games and stuff like that.

367
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,060
They can just make and publish the stuff that they want to make.

368
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
Sure.

369
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,260
It may be under like the Fortnite brand or something like that.

370
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,980
But Fortnite has been getting kind of creative on its own with different things.

371
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,100
So it wouldn't be surprising that they incorporate something with that, because it is a huge

372
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
brand.

373
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,140
Well, and I wonder if harmonics is concept of the music game shooter.

374
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,060
And I'm sorry, I forgot what it was called.

375
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Something about.

376
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:53,780
I don't remember somebody in chat will remember, but maybe there are concepts from that that

377
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,460
were interesting because, you know, let's say, OK, Fortnite is a shooty shooty bang bang.

378
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,140
Maybe they want to do a music mode type of thing to draw in a different audience that

379
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,020
tends to write off Fortnite as a shooty shooty bang bang game.

380
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,420
So maybe they are trying to partner up with companies that do radically different things

381
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,020
to bring radically different experiences to Fortnite.

382
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,900
And maybe, you know, I know I'm reaching here, but maybe some of that music game shooter

383
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,460
stuff will have its day after all in Fortnite.

384
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,820
Going to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping live tonight,

385
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,460
SG100Matt says, I guess I'm OK with Epic buying them.

386
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,140
If it was EA, they would be dissolved or forced to work on a battlefield game.

387
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,060
I guess they're going to be working on Fortnite, but it could be worse.

388
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,660
Yeah, it could be worse, especially, you know, if you're I don't know, I have my ups and

389
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,100
downs with Epic.

390
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,420
There's a lot of things I like that Epic does.

391
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,540
There's a lot of things I don't like that Epic does.

392
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,780
And namely, it's Tim Sweeney's Twitter account.

393
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,660
But that's a whole other topic for a different day.

394
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:05,060
Yeah, I mean, I would like to see Fortnite as far as the whole metaverse concept, right,

395
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,940
which seems to be this big thing we're moving into in the 20s.

396
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,580
Everybody wants to it's the metaverse in 20s.

397
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,020
Literally that company called Meta that I'm still calling Facebook wants to do it.

398
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,060
Niantic has talked about their wanting to do it.

399
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,480
Fortnite wants to do it in their own way.

400
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,040
And these are all three very different approaches to the metaverse.

401
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,900
And there's other companies wanting to do this as well.

402
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
As long as they all stay the fuck away from NFTs.

403
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,980
Tigerclaw in chat says, what if Valve were to buy them?

404
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,260
Well, that would have been cool.

405
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,660
But OK, you want to talk about a company that really hasn't done any games lately.

406
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,660
Let's talk about Valve.

407
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,500
Well, I guess there was Half-Life Alyx, but how long did that take?

408
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
How long did that take?

409
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,460
We're all bitter that there's no Portal 3 or Half-Life 3 or anything 3.

410
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
So yeah.

411
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,020
Dr. C says, I agree with Rob.

412
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,420
I wonder if they'll do something like that in Fortnite.

413
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:06,260
I suppose only time will tell, but we know Fortnite craves those musical experiences

414
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,700
as evidenced by the variety.

415
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,140
It's not just Ariana Grande.

416
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,460
That's just the one that got my attention as a gay.

417
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,940
I have to support that.

418
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,140
But there's lots of what Travis Scott had a concert in Fortnite, too.

419
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,140
There's been countless.

420
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,780
I remember there was a Weezer album that debuted in Fortnite because I actually looked at that

421
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,000
level and that whole thing.

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
It actually got me to look.

423
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:33,800
So I'm curious to see what music can do to change the conversation of Fortnite from its

424
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,680
just Battle Royale.

425
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,000
I think that could be very interesting.

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
So we'll see.

427
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
And best of luck to everyone at Harmonix.

428
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,920
I just hope this doesn't mean layoffs or any of this garbage.

429
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,520
I hope it means more people and more folks to help on all that stuff.

430
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,040
Because we know Epic has oodles and oodles of money.

431
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,200
Speaking of Epic and that whole thing, Dark Soccer, relevant to your interest, certainly,

432
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,840
and I'm sure you're already aware, Dead by Daylight is going to be free on the Epic store

433
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,200
next week because this is the big launch of Dead by Daylight on the Epic store.

434
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
It's not there yet.

435
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,160
But apparently it is going to be cross purchases with Steam, Stadia.

436
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I think that's it.

437
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Because Switch isn't in on that.

438
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Steam and Stadia are the only two that have.

439
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Oh, Windows Store.

440
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Windows Store.

441
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
I forgot.

442
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,640
Windows Store doesn't have the tie in to the behavior account.

443
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
You are right.

444
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
Stadia and Steam do right now.

445
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
You are right.

446
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Sorry.

447
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,920
I was thinking about the postgame chat and how they do have that.

448
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,880
But anyway, that's that's totally different.

449
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,040
Yeah, no, but and actually the thing is, is that it's really just cross progression.

450
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,160
I still had to buy all my DLC on Steam and Stadia.

451
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,800
I didn't know that.

452
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Gross.

453
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,440
Well, cross progression is nice, at least, I guess.

454
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,200
So well, yeah.

455
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,600
And for those of you that I think all of my in-game purchases, like my cosmetics and whatnot,

456
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
those carry over with me.

457
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,280
OK, that makes sense.

458
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,700
Probably everything original probably carries over.

459
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,560
Just not the license stuff is probably the tricky thing with that.

460
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,920
No, the license stuff should carry over, I mean, because I bought the Stranger Things

461
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
DLC on Steam.

462
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,680
Oh, nice.

463
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,840
So I'll have that on both because I paid for them on both.

464
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,080
But my in-game stuff, because I bought, you know, Jonathan Byers as one of my characters,

465
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,900
you know, the skin for Steve.

466
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,680
I should have I have all of the Stranger Things content and it should carry over.

467
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,640
I just don't have a PC I can test it on.

468
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Fair.

469
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,880
Unless we logged into my Steam account or something on your computer to test it out.

470
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
I don't know.

471
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Yeah.

472
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,360
Well, if you're if you're sick of hearing Dark Sakura and I talk about Dead by Daylight

473
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,280
all the time, this is this this is your chance to see if it's for you because it and for

474
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,900
whatever reason, you don't have Game Pass either and have checked it out that way.

475
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,800
It will be free on the Epic Store next week.

476
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,840
So you can keyboard and mouse away or plug in a controller, do it that way, whatever.

477
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
So there you go.

478
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
I guess there is that particular PSA about that.

479
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,700
But yeah, Epic Games has bought Harmonix.

480
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,300
So we will see how this partnership develops, but it's probably going to be several months

481
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,980
before we see any of that result.

482
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,020
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

483
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,720
been playing this week.

484
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,820
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

485
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,940
How was your gaming week?

486
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,820
I played Dead by Daylight and it's double XP this weekend.

487
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,340
And what else did I do?

488
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,220
I've played Wordscapes, I've played Fantasian.

489
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
That's really about it.

490
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:52,980
I picked up Slave Aspire and I bought some PC games, hoping that they would work on the

491
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,700
sale going on right now.

492
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:07,580
Oh, geez, sorry, I hit the wrong thing and it decided to also not work.

493
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:18,980
Right now there is so much going on that it's a little bit hard to get everything in line

494
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,780
and get everything going with all the other games that are on my list to play.

495
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,660
I could check my Steam purchase history real quick and tell you what I bought.

496
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,980
Your Steam backlog has been growing.

497
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,420
I've also been buying apps on Steam, like the Discord bot creator.

498
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,140
Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing.

499
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,180
Oh, yeah, there's plenty of good apps on Steam.

500
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,020
I've bought music makers, specifically the Discord app.

501
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,140
I didn't know that was a thing.

502
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,500
I never would have thought to look for that.

503
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,180
But I know they have game engine creator things, some of the big game maker stuff is on Steam.

504
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:03,740
What I just bought is Tempest 4000 and Yara's Revenge, they're both on sale.

505
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:11,700
Gorgoa, Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, Discord bot studio, Dimension Drive and Easy Pose for drawing.

506
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,780
I also picked up Kung Fury Street Rage.

507
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,700
Why not?

508
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,300
And I did get Poppy Playtime.

509
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Oh, no, I still need to play that.

510
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,980
So soon, soon, soon.

511
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,140
I also did because it's for Mac.

512
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,580
I got Planescape Torment.

513
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm actually thinking about playing it on Steam.

514
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,460
Yeah, cool.

515
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,340
All right, Loki, how about you?

516
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,740
How was your gaming week?

517
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,540
I didn't play a whole ton other than Minecraft.

518
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:49,540
I did play Minecraft Dungeons, though, because we took the kids to the local skating rink

519
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,060
and they've upgraded all their arcade games.

520
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,620
And so now they have the Minecraft Dungeons arcade game, which is pretty fun.

521
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,340
And what's neat about that one is not only is it, you know, it kind of reminds me a lot

522
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,860
of like the old Gauntlet Legends games, but you get like cards from the game every time

523
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
you play it.

524
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,340
And you can use the cards like scan into basically get different armor sets and different like

525
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:23,660
so you have like a armor set, a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and a familiar.

526
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,180
And so you can scan those in to get different like pets and stuff.

527
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
So it's pretty cool.

528
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,220
It's like a collection of cards from playing that.

529
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Hmm.

530
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,940
That sounds like Derby Owners Club or Initial D in the arcade back in the day.

531
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Yeah.

532
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Yeah, a little bit like that.

533
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,820
But yeah, you get cards every time.

534
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,940
And that's been is pretty fun.

535
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,780
So I guess I'll just have to play the actual game that I own first.

536
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,420
I don't know why I'm playing in the arcade when I can just play it at home.

537
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,780
But yeah, I miss I miss Dark Sakura's File of Horses.

538
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,460
She had this big old thing that you unzipped and plop.

539
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,780
It's it was probably for like baseball cards or other types of trading cards.

540
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,500
It was a billfold, like cards tall.

541
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,100
But it was like, let's let me whip out one of my horses and, you know, thumbing through

542
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
the pages.

543
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
Oh, there's there's Polteri.

544
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,940
There's, you know, and all these horses that she had.

545
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,780
I just cracked me up.

546
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,060
The Derby Owners Club hardcore, though, like all had that all had that it was always funny

547
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
to watch.

548
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,580
So I had all those those names.

549
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,340
Pod Culture is mentioning the Injustice arcade game was kind of like that, too, with character

550
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
cards.

551
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
Interesting.

552
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
I guess at least you get something.

553
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Yeah.

554
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Something besides tickets.

555
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm not sure this is going to come over on the webcam when we try.

556
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,140
But I got I got my magazine.

557
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Oh, yeah.

558
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,100
The magazine you were featured in over in the UK.

559
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Congrats on that.

560
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Yes.

561
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Yes.

562
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
I got that.

563
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I got a few copies of that.

564
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
So we got.

565
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Yeah.

566
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
That's sweet.

567
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
What did they do?

568
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Did they mention O.L.R.?

569
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
No.

570
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
And they also never mind.

571
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
All right.

572
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
No, just kidding.

573
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,780
They took some liberties with trying to figure out what the story of the game was, even though

574
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,780
I did send them a synopsis of it.

575
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,560
So apparently now the game does actually take place in New York.

576
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:15,820
It is canon now because of the I guess because the first level Central Park, you know, they

577
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,100
assume that, oh, well, let's go to New York.

578
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Yeah.

579
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
It must be New York.

580
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
And yeah.

581
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,660
So I thought it was kind of funny.

582
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
Yeah.

583
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
It's.

584
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Yeah.

585
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,820
And they were so confident about it, too, like they're like, you know, the game sees

586
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,620
you take control of a guy who doesn't just like people jogging in his city, New York,

587
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
to be precise.

588
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
Like, OK.

589
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Oh, wow.

590
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
York now.

591
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
All right.

592
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,060
I guess somebody else wrote your game.

593
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
That's fine.

594
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
But yeah, it's cool.

595
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,340
They're just like, oh, an American made it.

596
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
It's in New York.

597
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Yeah.

598
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
It's just it's all good.

599
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
You know what?

600
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
It doesn't matter.

601
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
It can be in New York.

602
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,460
It can be in your hometown, whatever you want it to be, whatever you whatever your head

603
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,980
cannon says it is.

604
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
Exactly.

605
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,780
You can you can pixel poop wherever you like, of course.

606
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,540
Well, congratulations on the magazine feature.

607
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
That's really cool.

608
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,020
And that's that's cool shit magazine over in the UK.

609
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,140
So hopefully folks overseas, I don't know if they can go into like a Barnes and Noble

610
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
type thing.

611
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Yeah.

612
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
You can.

613
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Yeah, I'm not sure.

614
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
I mean, it's a very nice magazine.

615
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,540
I have to say, like, if I actually saw this in the store, like I would definitely pick

616
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
it up.

617
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,740
It's like very premium feeling.

618
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Cool.

619
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
It's pretty cool.

620
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,180
They've got like reviews of like old toys and like old movies and all sorts of weird

621
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,180
stuff in here.

622
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,460
So it's like really cool.

623
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,780
Are you saying it's full of cool shit?

624
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,780
It is full.

625
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Yes.

626
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,380
All right.

627
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,380
If you want to order that online, if you're in the US or somewhere else, you want to order

628
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
that.

629
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,020
Loki did put a link on his Twitter over at Twitter dot com slash Loki O.L.R. if you want

630
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,420
to follow up on that and order yourself some cool shit.

631
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
My gaming week.

632
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,540
So like everybody else, you know, the holidays and everything kind of got in the way.

633
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,820
So I haven't played a lot.

634
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,020
I play I've also been doing Dead by Daylight, kind of like our soccer has been trying to

635
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,380
enjoy the double blood point event.

636
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,920
I finally prestiged Cheryl slash James today up to level one.

637
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,540
So I have to start them over.

638
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,580
Why did I prestige?

639
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't know.

640
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,580
It's the thing to do, I guess.

641
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
So I've been working on that.

642
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,380
I only have two prestigious.

643
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,540
Yeah, I have I have Dwight prestige.

644
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,260
I don't think I have any killers.

645
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,220
So it's something I because I hate how you lose everything, but that's part of it.

646
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,140
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.

647
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,780
I'm trying to finish up that Moogle tome event because I want that leather jacket.

648
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,300
I've gotten all the mounts I need.

649
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,220
I've gotten the pets, everything else.

650
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,140
But it's that hundred tome leather jacket.

651
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,180
And it's like, oh, the awful grind of having to do Praetorium or something like that over

652
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,660
and over again to get the tomes.

653
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,100
But hey, I'll get there and I will get my leather jacket to complete my look for Endwalker

654
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,260
on Friday.

655
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,340
I hope this doesn't mean the game is down all day Thursday.

656
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,100
They haven't really said or at least I've missed it if there was all day maintenance,

657
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,740
but I'm assuming there has to be before an expansion releases.

658
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,380
So I guess that is going to come quick and fast this this week as we lead up to Friday's

659
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,860
early access for Endwalker.

660
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,580
The other big game I've honestly been playing a lot of this weekend is No Man's Sky, which

661
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,700
I have talked about plenty on this show before.

662
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Why am I back on this bullshit again?

663
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,900
Well, because No Man's Sky announced that they are going to be repeating the different

664
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,160
expeditions.

665
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,580
So these seasonal events, you know, we kind of took to mean seasonal, meaning if you miss

666
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,060
it, you're going to miss it forever and you won't be able to get these rewards again.

667
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,980
Well, it's actually kind of neat because during this kind of slower holiday period between,

668
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,720
you know, from Thanksgiving until New Year's, you know, you have all these holidays going

669
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
on.

670
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,900
It is kind of interesting how the team over at Hello Games has just decided, well, let's

671
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,240
repeat the original expeditions for a shorter time so that those that missed them can catch

672
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
up on them.

673
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,700
So because I never finished Expedition One, I did two and three.

674
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,940
I didn't do one and four completely.

675
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,260
So I am trying to like put the pedal to the metal, so to speak, and try to finish Expedition

676
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,640
One to get my rewards.

677
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,500
And then I'll be able to sit out two and three while I'm busy playing the Final Fantasy 14

678
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:12,620
expansion and then move on to Expedition Four when that recaps towards the end of the year.

679
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,220
So I've been playing quite a bit of that trying to finish up Expedition One.

680
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,940
I am further than I was the first time, but they also compressed the expeditions a little

681
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
bit.

682
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,440
So they all they start on new planets.

683
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,820
That was the first thing I noticed.

684
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,820
It's not the exact same as it was before.

685
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,260
And they've cut down some of the grinds.

686
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,260
So I remember before, I think you had to do like 10 freighter missions, but now you only

687
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,880
have to do three.

688
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,380
And I think there were some other things that you had to do a lot more of.

689
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,100
Like I think there were 10 artifacts and now again, you only have to do three.

690
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,620
So I think they did cut down a bunch of stuff to fit the two-week timeframe.

691
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,060
But if you're going to get into this because of what I'm saying and I'm letting you know

692
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,400
the expeditions are back and you're like, oh, I want to finish Expedition One too.

693
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,700
You need to start now because you're like today, because there are some things that

694
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,020
you grind that you're not going to get done by Friday if you wait until Thursday to do

695
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
it.

696
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,820
Like the three freighter missions is going to be impossible.

697
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,620
You're not going to be able to do three of the five freighter missions because they're

698
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,900
going to be too difficult for your brand new freighter.

699
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:20,980
So just something to think about and all that as you are going into No Man's Sky.

700
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,500
I'm also really excited because Alan has picked up No Man's Sky again from this.

701
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,320
So he's doing Expedition One right now, although he's playing on Steam and something bugged

702
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,660
out on him that made him really frustrated.

703
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,300
Like he couldn't get the frigate for free that you're supposed to get, so he had to

704
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
buy it.

705
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Like really frustrating.

706
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,220
It didn't happen to me on Xbox Series X where I'm playing.

707
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:50,660
So he's been doing that, but he's really big on now he can do that Normandy mission that

708
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,840
he missed because that was Expedition Two was the one and it was only up for two or

709
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,260
three weeks the first time.

710
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,400
And that's the one that rewarded the Normandy at the end.

711
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,080
Now keep in mind, you don't get to fly the Normandy.

712
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,360
You don't really get to tour the Normandy, you can fly around it and look at it up close

713
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,000
and all that stuff.

714
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But that's it.

715
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,760
It is just another addition to your fleet that's purely cosmetic.

716
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,080
So it's not going to be suddenly No Man's Mass Effect.

717
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,280
It's just a very simple little artistic crossover.

718
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,600
And they do like Paragon and Renegade titles and other throws to the Mass Effect universe.

719
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,840
That's really it.

720
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,820
But I still think it's cool and as a uber fan of both those games, but I already did

721
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
it the first time.

722
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,420
I don't need to do it again, but I'm excited that Alan, who is an uber fan of at least

723
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,440
Mass Effect and trying to get back to No Man's Sky can do both those things now.

724
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,540
So yeah, I will probably stream at some point this week.

725
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,580
I'm going to try and get back into my regular post-work streams.

726
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
I have been playing actually a lot of mobile gaming as well still.

727
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,100
I was going pretty hard on Ingress because they were doing double AP, but that is winding

728
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,740
up tomorrow and it's been really good for exercise.

729
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,040
I've been trying to get more exercise lately with everything I've talked about in the prior

730
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,200
weeks on this show and Pikmin actually.

731
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Alan and I went on a walk today in Pikmin and you know, in Pikmin you can plant flowers.

732
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
That's kind of the thing that you do.

733
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640
And we planted blue pansies, both of us, and we walked around the park and we walked around

734
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,640
the bud, the flower bud at the park so many times.

735
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,080
We got it to spawn a blue rose and I haven't even seen that that game has blue roses.

736
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,720
I knew it had red roses.

737
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,920
I'd seen screen caps of that and I saw it in San Francisco.

738
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,080
I have never seen a blue rose in that game anywhere online.

739
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,040
Granted, I don't do a lot of reading on Pikmin Blue, but we got one to spawn here today and

740
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
that was really exciting.

741
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,720
So if you're trying to play in that game, get a lot, a lot of pansies planted instead

742
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
of the regular flowers.

743
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,480
And I think it increases your chances at spawning a rose and yes, it dropped rose petals.

744
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
So I got blue rose petals, but only like a few.

745
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,640
So yeah, so lots of mobile gaming, but that's been very good for exercising too.

746
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,480
I just have to say like you, I know many of you can kind of give or take Pikmin Bloom

747
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,280
and I'm not trying to pretend that the game is like, oh my God, it's the most amazing

748
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,000
thing that's ever happened, but it has gamified exercising and walking for me at a time that

749
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
I really needed it.

750
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:22,480
I got 10,000 steps Friday, Saturday, and I think one other day this week.

751
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,800
So I didn't get it today because I let myself rest a little bit, but I'll probably get 5,000

752
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,960
because I'll probably go on a walk after the show.

753
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,280
So it's been very, very, very good for incentivizing all that.

754
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,560
So thanks to Niantic, who liked my tweet about the blue rose, by the way, Niantic actually

755
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
liked that.

756
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I thought that was cute.

757
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Yeah.

758
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
All right.

759
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Let's move on.

760
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,840
We're going to get into some stories for the week again, with it being Thanksgiving in

761
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,040
the US this week, there wasn't a lot of news, but there's still some things going on in

762
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,980
the gaming world we thought we'd bring to the table tonight.

763
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,100
So Loki, why don't you start us off with our first story?

764
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,500
All right.

765
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:04,260
So let's go ahead and talk about this drama that's going on with Roblox and not necessarily

766
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:13,700
that Roblox is being sued by a company, especially for, you know, unfair payment of their developers.

767
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,060
But no, this is actually Roblox suing somebody on the platform.

768
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,720
So there's this guy, Ruben Sim, who's been accused of sexual harassment, terrorist threats,

769
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,700
and trying to post pictures of Hitler on there.

770
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,680
Apparently, he has been doing this for a while, it sounds like.

771
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,020
So back in...

772
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,020
He's garbage.

773
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
Yeah.

774
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Some of the things he's done.

775
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,140
So he glamorized the April 3rd, 2018 active shooter and murder at YouTube headquarters

776
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:52,180
and said that something similar should happen to the Roblox headquarters in San Mateo.

777
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:59,100
He attempted to upload a nude image of himself with only a lampshade covering him.

778
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,680
All sorts of different slurs.

779
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,940
He tried to upload a sex game and upload pictures of Hitler.

780
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:13,060
So apparently also used his subscribers to try to do other things as well.

781
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,180
So yeah, it's just a piece of trash.

782
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,820
And so now they are suing him for damages.

783
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Good.

784
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
TBH.

785
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Good.

786
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,780
Like, you know, I think heading into this, I was kind of like, well, that seems kind

787
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,000
of extreme.

788
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,580
Like you would go and sue a YouTuber that's like playing pranks, but I guess that they're

789
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,000
actually trying to break your game.

790
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,540
But now that you've explained what this individual is doing, and this really sounds like an unwell

791
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,880
individual in many senses, the word good, I'm actually totally team Roblox on this.

792
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,320
I think it's time to start making an example of some of these individuals that literally

793
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,800
think there is no repercussion for these sorts of things.

794
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,960
And also, I'm sorry, there's also another piece to it also.

795
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,880
He also made terrorist threats, basically that called in fake bomb threats to the Roblox

796
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,620
developers conference in San Francisco.

797
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,820
So there's that too.

798
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,800
This person is not well, but it certainly doesn't excuse any of this behavior.

799
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,920
And this person really deserves a wake up call of the highest regard.

800
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,740
And I think this lawsuit is the way to do it.

801
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:26,500
And quite frankly, for these extreme scenarios, especially, I hope to see more game companies

802
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,380
do it.

803
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,120
Good, good.

804
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Bring it all out.

805
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,520
Bring out the facts in a court of law, put it on the public record.

806
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,160
Let these people know.

807
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,860
There is accountability somewhere for these actions.

808
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,200
It's what a lot of us have been begging for that stream and do this stuff on Twitch and

809
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:57,220
so forth when we hear about marginalized creators, whether it be black people, brown people,

810
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,840
different religious people streaming, whether it be gay, lesbian, transgender, non-binary,

811
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
you name it.

812
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,200
All these marginalized groups on Twitch, they all get targeted with swatting.

813
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,740
Women get targeted with swatting.

814
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,840
It's disgusting.

815
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,560
And we've been begging for accountability for these individuals.

816
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,680
The best news that ever happened was when Twitch sued the two people that were apparently

817
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,400
behind the Haas stuff, right?

818
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,720
Some time ago or something along those lines.

819
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Hooray!

820
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
That was long overdue.

821
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Hooray.

822
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Yes.

823
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,080
It sucks that, like, you know, it's having to be handled in a civil courtroom as opposed

824
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,480
to a criminal one where it ought to be handled.

825
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,880
Some of these swatting incidents.

826
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Well, and this guy's still got his channel of 700,000 subscribers on YouTube.

827
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,040
He's still platformed on YouTube because apparently they think this is OK.

828
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
I don't know.

829
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,940
Who the fuck would subscribe to something like I.

830
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:02,260
The fact that 700,000 people subscribe to that, I'm going to write off that there are

831
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,300
bot accounts of which there's usually many tied to something, but even still, even if

832
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:13,660
you have that and assume that 300,000 of them are real, that is far too many people.

833
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:22,940
And that's that says a lot about why society feels really broken sometimes.

834
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,980
And I don't know what else to say about that all the time.

835
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
I know.

836
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,580
I don't know what else to say about that on my little video game podcast with my friends.

837
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:37,540
Like I but just just marinate in that for a minute, 750,000 accounts, half of which

838
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,060
sure are probably bots and, you know, throwaways.

839
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:47,460
But at least half of that are following this person's content and essentially encouraging

840
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:54,460
and egging that on nude pictures, pictures of Hitler in a children's game.

841
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:03,100
Hmm. I don't know, I'm disgusted, too, and that's why I'm I'm actually kind of glad to

842
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,740
see Roblox suing them, throw the it should be a criminal trial, quite frankly.

843
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:14,060
It shouldn't be a civil trial, but you know how it goes sometimes with a criminal or the

844
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,380
criminal court won't do it.

845
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,940
Civil court will do it.

846
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,860
So anyway, yeah.

847
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,580
And I see a lot of folks in chat, Mike Deaf saying seven hundred thousand subs, the fuck.

848
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,620
Yeah, my reaction exactly.

849
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,340
I see seven hundred seventy four now, but.

850
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,100
Well, because of all the coverage this is getting, it's actually probably encouraging

851
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,900
more people with with such wonderful hits as swearing at Roblox admins with voice chat,

852
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,340
that that's one of his higher ranking videos of of late.

853
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,100
Just. Yeah, he's just constantly harassing people online.

854
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:54,260
Whatever happened to calling most tavern and asking for Mike last name hunt, whatever happened

855
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,260
to that, that is silly, ridiculous.

856
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:05,260
And the pain, you know, there's no you know, it goes away in 15 seconds.

857
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,580
It's a stupid fucking prank.

858
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,180
What? And then you're done.

859
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,780
What Loki's describing here is not a stupid fucking prank.

860
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,820
This is like like if you think about it.

861
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,020
Is psychological damage on children.

862
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,020
It is. It's disgusting and there's no excuse for it.

863
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Absolutely not.

864
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,780
Fifth dream in chat with it, fifth dream in chat with a decent point, actually saying

865
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:38,580
caller ID happened, you know, and I realized the concept of Internet ID would be

866
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,620
controversial and I'm not even sure I am completely in favor of something like that.

867
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:47,860
However, there has to be some sort of accountability for people like this and for

868
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,620
people that are phoning in false SWAT reports and things of that nature.

869
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,260
Where's the accountability?

870
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,780
It's not until I and so I applaud Roblox for starting, even though I think it's a

871
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,260
ridiculous game and platform, but it's for kids, whatever.

872
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,220
It's not for me. I'm not the audience.

873
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,020
Fine. I applaud Roblox and thank them for taking this person to court and getting it

874
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,820
out in the open and putting it on public record, because that's where this has to be

875
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,980
solved, unfortunately.

876
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,740
Gross. Just so disgusted.

877
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,980
SSJ 100 Matt says he's doing it for the subs.

878
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,740
Whatever YouTube revenue he thought he was going to get is going to Roblox.

879
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,140
And quite honestly, I hope Roblox in turn donates it to a children's charity to try to

880
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,500
undo some of the damage this guy is doing, although I'm not going to put that pressure

881
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,940
on Roblox because they probably have to pay more admins and so forth to deal with

882
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,580
this bullshit. And that is understandable.

883
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,940
But E3VL in chat says, isn't there a two digit number you can press to be unknown caller

884
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,300
ID? I remember someone doing that in high school.

885
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,420
There is. But my understanding is it's still like it's really easy to trace calls now.

886
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:02,860
Like that's why a lot of the phone pranking like stopped, like that is because even though

887
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,180
you can block caller ID, it is very easy to get the phone records and figure out who's

888
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,980
doing it and have that complaint or whatever.

889
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,220
Uh, your overrated face in chat, welcome, by the way, I think that's a new name, says

890
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,340
Star 66.

891
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,100
Yeah, I thought it was I actually thought it was Star 69.

892
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,220
Nice. I think Star 69 is the call back.

893
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,420
Yeah. Oh, that was OK.

894
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,500
Nice. But like Star 70 or something was the I know it was probably different on every

895
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,940
phone company and what have you.

896
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,460
So anyway. Yeah, folks, it just folks in chat are lighting at 62, 62, just depending on

897
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,220
where you live. Anyway, fuck this guy especially.

898
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,420
And fuck people that are doing these these pranks that are way over the line again,

899
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,700
memeing and dead by daylight.

900
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,420
Is your refrigerator running?

901
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,460
That's one thing, these things that this guy's doing completely another and for the

902
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,460
money and the YouTube.

903
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,860
Yeah, I also think it's a problem that YouTube is not shutting this person down.

904
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,460
Gross. But I guess let's make money off those seven hundred thousand accounts and

905
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,020
donate it to children. That would be a lovely resolution.

906
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:13,660
Yeah. Meanwhile, let's talk about what could have been, but what is not in less

907
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,820
serious news, this is something that could have been for a video game series, but is

908
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,020
not. And that is Mortal Kombat.

909
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:28,940
And apparently it was rumored that Keanu Reeves was supposed to make an appearance in

910
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,980
Mortal Kombat at some point, whether Neo from The Matrix or John Wick or whatever

911
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:39,340
happened. This was answered in a fan video with Esquire to talk about The Matrix for

912
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,740
somebody had asked this whole thing.

913
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,980
And Keanu said, if it was up to me, no, Mortal Kombat is awesome in so many ways.

914
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,700
But I think, you know, Neo, John Wick, yeah, man, they're doing their own thing.

915
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,740
Mortal Kombat's doing their own thing.

916
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,420
So people are kind of having that fantasy because it is Warner Brothers that

917
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,300
essentially owns both the license.

918
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,620
So it would be easy, I suppose.

919
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,420
But of course, you have to get the likeness of the actor less easy.

920
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,180
And there's also nothing out there that actually says this was ever in discussion.

921
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,420
It's probably just one of those rumors that was out there or what have you or, you know,

922
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,380
somebody took wouldn't this be cool to something further?

923
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,260
But I can also like I can understand, you know, Mortal Kombat 10, 11.

924
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,540
They are some pretty violent games.

925
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,260
And like if you're Keanu Reeves, do you want to really see Scorpion cutting your head off

926
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,020
and setting you on fire and peeing on you and whatever else they do?

927
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,980
In that case, do you really want to see that happen?

928
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,380
Your likeness? Probably not.

929
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,340
So I, I understand why there are many actors and actresses who would probably say, you

930
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,700
know, I think we'll pass on this one for this.

931
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:51,060
Now, you know, there were some characters like Freddy, Jason didn't like Freddy showed

932
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,420
up in Mortal Kombat nine.

933
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,860
Right. And then, yeah, like the predator is in one of like a lot of silly movie

934
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,340
characters are in them, but they're usually masked or they don't like look like the

935
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,580
actor or anything like that.

936
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,420
They don't let them like when it was Joker, they didn't let him shoot somebody.

937
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,420
That was probably the arrangement with DC Comics in that particular game, because that's

938
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,300
why they had the whole brutality thing.

939
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,420
And it wasn't like there were no fatalities.

940
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,900
Yeah, nobody wants to see Wonder Woman get decapitated.

941
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,140
That would be disgusting. So like it wouldn't have fit in that universe, you know.

942
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,740
So I think that's why the brutalities were a little better.

943
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,020
And at least, you know, with the Joker thing, it kind of went off camera.

944
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,220
So you never really knew, like, was it a joke?

945
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,020
Who knows? So anyway.

946
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,460
Yeah, let's see.

947
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,860
Some folks in chat are still talking about the prank stuff and the callback stuff.

948
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,460
E3VL is saying at least two times a week, someone wants to know about my car's extended

949
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,420
warranty. Oh, my God.

950
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,740
That is those those calls are out of control, as are the spam texts.

951
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,460
I get them. I kid you not.

952
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,140
Every day, every day.

953
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,260
OK, if you reply stop.

954
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,420
But then they know they know somebody's looking, I forward them to the thing, Rob.

955
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:17,580
They are legally required if you say stop to stop all further communications, it's like a

956
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,420
do not call list.

957
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,820
Where do I report that if they don't?

958
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,620
I'm serious because I'm so sick of these texts.

959
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,740
That would be the the FCC.

960
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,020
I've been forwarding them all to the AT&T has a number maybe folks don't know this, but

961
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,380
this is unique to AT&T.

962
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,540
I don't other carriers probably have a similar thing, but AT&T has seventy seven twenty

963
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,700
six, which is if you spell spam, you forward the message and then it says, thanks for

964
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,540
reporting this. What number did you get it from?

965
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,780
And then it says, thanks. We'll look into it.

966
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,260
Of course, nothing's happened, but I liked I like to feel like if I reported enough times,

967
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,180
something will happen.

968
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,940
So, well, sadly, that's not quite the case.

969
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,140
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

970
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,660
TigerCon chats is the problem with the spam calls that they are mostly recordings and you

971
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,500
hear those same recordings in different numbers.

972
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,740
Yeah, it's oof, oof, oof.

973
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,540
Whatever happened to that do not call list and all that, like make that shit go away.

974
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:17,180
The thing is, is that the do not call list tends to go, if I if I remember correctly, I

975
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,700
think it only applies to.

976
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,940
Like U.S.

977
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,940
telemarketing calls are for U.S.

978
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,260
companies. Oh, sure, because they can't legislate what happens elsewhere in the world, of

979
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,740
course, makes sense. Yeah, but with a lot of those, too, though, if you get those

980
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,940
marketing calls, if you listen long enough, they'll give you the do the opt out one and

981
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,700
they do remove you from their lists because I don't get them as much since I just waited

982
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,500
them out. Interesting.

983
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,140
And I was hanging up. Yeah, it is it is it is full on required.

984
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,340
I'm about to turn that thing on on my phone where it just simply doesn't ring if I don't

985
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,060
have the person listed as a contact.

986
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,340
Like I I used to have a Pixel phone and they used to have that.

987
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:07,220
I don't know why it's not just any Android phone, but they used to have it where Google

988
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,500
actually answer your phone for you to have like a robot, not really robot voice, but it's

989
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,460
like an AI voice that it's it screens your call for you and then it does like a voice

990
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,780
attacks to what the person's saying.

991
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,820
And so I used to do that all the time on my old phone and I got a new phone that

992
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,620
unfortunately wasn't a pixel because they didn't have them at the time.

993
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,900
And now it doesn't do that. And it's I miss that so much, but interesting.

994
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,740
Really wish that was something that they offered on other non pixel devices.

995
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,420
Interesting. All right.

996
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,660
Good to know. From Keanu Reeves to spam telephone calls, just another episode of Orange

997
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,980
Launch Radio. All right, let's move on to something I'm sure we're going to be slightly

998
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,740
passionate about. I don't know, dark soccer.

999
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,460
What do you think of this next one?

1000
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,700
I'm pretty excited.

1001
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,540
OK, I want to I want to believe I want to believe that's a good way to put I want to

1002
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:02,260
believe. So there was supposed to have been a Mass Effect movie and it was canceled

1003
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,260
because legendary pictures backed out of it.

1004
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:11,740
You know, and basically Bioware was like, you know, we're we weren't going to be able to

1005
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,540
tell the story in 90 to 120 minutes.

1006
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:22,020
So basically now they are nearing a deal with Amazon to do a Mass Effect TV series,

1007
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,340
which is pretty good because it's going to be coming on on the tail end of the expanse if

1008
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:32,820
it happens. So it'll cover their sci fi gap once that other show is gone.

1009
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:39,900
And I mean, hopefully it's going to be set in the prime universe and not the the Andromeda

1010
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,700
universe. Or if they do anything, it might be some other new story, but at least we're

1011
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,940
going to be getting some more Mass Effect from what it looks like.

1012
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,900
I think it'll be awesome.

1013
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,940
I I'm certainly on board with a Mass Effect TV series, but tell me what you think about

1014
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,180
this dark soccer, because this might be the controversial point.

1015
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,340
I really do not want them to do Shepard.

1016
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,700
I think they would be I think they would be getting into some real dangerous territory if

1017
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,420
they could. Number one, whoever they cast, the people that played the opposite gender

1018
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:13,020
Shepard are going to be pissed like there is no there is no pleasing the fandom now.

1019
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,180
They could we need a non-binary Shepard.

1020
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,260
Fine. That's all.

1021
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,500
Well, I mean, you also have Liara technically a non-binary race, but yes, fine.

1022
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:28,180
Yes, of course. All that. However, I am fine with something parallel in that

1023
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,900
same sort of like because I think it would actually be really cool if there was a

1024
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,900
parallel story that wasn't Shepard, but somebody else.

1025
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,780
And then that way you could have some of the other characters cross over like Liara

1026
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,260
actually would be a great example, especially considering her lifespan.

1027
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,780
You could you know, it could be a little bit after we get four, but we could have our

1028
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:55,300
just a car. I mean, because I'm sure she she goes out in the makeup all the time.

1029
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,540
I'm sure she'd happily do it.

1030
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,460
Yeah, I think maybe a prequel would be all right, too.

1031
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,020
But I just I just I just don't want them to try to tell the Shepard story in a TV

1032
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,780
series. But I think there's ways they could do it where they could kind of go around

1033
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,540
the Shepard thing and still do something very satisfying.

1034
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,700
So I think so. Yeah.

1035
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,340
And if you had a prequel, you could do something with both Kayden and Ashley to

1036
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,700
not, you know, piss people and spoiler alert for a years old game.

1037
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,300
But you could do something that, you know, would would please fans of both those

1038
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,580
people. I just think maybe either a slight prequel like just before Shepard or

1039
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,940
something excuse me, hiccups parallel would be perfect.

1040
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,300
Or what if you have something about like a different side character, like maybe about

1041
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,180
Vega? Oh, I love that idea.

1042
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:47,460
Go be a writer for the show. I love that idea, because then, yes, a parallel character

1043
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,460
who then intersects with everybody towards the climax of the

1044
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,580
story. I think that's a great idea.

1045
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,820
So, yeah, because, I mean, he seemed to have had an interesting life and, you know, he

1046
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:03,260
was trying to get into, you know, the N7 program and all that.

1047
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,460
I think it would be pretty neat.

1048
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,420
Tyron College, actually, didn't they do an animated thing about Vega?

1049
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,700
Yes, they did. And I have it and it was great.

1050
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,260
Yeah. All right.

1051
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,260
Now you're on to something.

1052
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,660
They got, you know, Freddie Prinze Jr.

1053
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,460
to do all the vocalizations.

1054
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,460
I would say maybe he could play Vega, but I guess he's he's kind of he's older than we are.

1055
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,060
He's not the right build. Yeah, he's not.

1056
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,740
He's nice getting a little older, too.

1057
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,940
I think he's dad bought it out a little bit, too.

1058
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,260
Vega's built like a tank.

1060
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:40,460
Tyron Chad over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says Mass Effect as a TV show makes

1061
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,420
sense because it's such a huge universe with a ton of world building.

1062
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,020
And for a show like this to work, they could just have a new character that you follow.

1063
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,580
And this character could be a new recruit in the Normandy.

1064
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,620
You could tell the stories from the game, from another character's point of view.

1065
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,900
I think that's the way to do it.

1066
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,380
Tell the stories from another character's point of view.

1067
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,020
And then you can see all the same types of places like the Citadel absolutely has to be it.

1068
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,740
It would have to not be, though, anything with the Normandy or Shepard specifically.

1069
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:17,660
Yeah, but there's there's a lot of gaps you could fill, like a lot happens between one and two.

1070
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:23,420
Why not set a TV show to help explain the events of what happens between one and two when

1071
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,260
Shepard is out of commission, so to speak?

1072
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:32,060
You know, I've already had like stuff written in the background, you know, so they should just

1073
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,260
totally they should hire me to write for them.

1074
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,140
I'd be good. I would I would love to.

1075
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,380
So I just I do not want them better than writing fan fiction.

1076
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,420
If they cast I write a treatment, they script it.

1077
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,900
If they cast John or Jane Shepard or whatever the default names are, if they cast those if they

1078
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,740
cast a John or a Jane Shepard, I'm I'm going to be really upset.

1079
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,620
I don't want them to try to tell that exact same story.

1080
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:04,340
But so all these ideas about a side universe, a side story, a tangential thing are great.

1081
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,980
What if they did do something like a.

1082
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,180
Andromeda ish.

1083
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:19,620
I'd be I'd actually be really super OK with an Andromeda ish story, even if it's not like

1084
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,700
those care, finally give us the story of the Korean arc, although that would be a really

1085
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,140
weird place to start a TV series.

1086
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,580
I think they did that book, didn't they?

1087
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,340
Yeah, they did. You're right. But I get that book.

1088
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:36,020
The idea of maybe another universe, another galaxy in that same thing, you it would basically

1089
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,220
be Star Trek, Voyager.

1090
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,660
And I'm totally OK with that, like, but with Mass Effect, people would be amazing, I think.

1091
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,020
Or what about post-war?

1092
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,900
Yeah, and they they get the mass relays working.

1093
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,100
Or a group gets thrown out with, you know, if you're going to take the whole Voyager

1094
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,380
thing, a ship gets thrown out via mass relay at the end of everything.

1095
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:07,540
Any of these ideas I am more than OK with, just please do not write fanfiction.

1096
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,820
I have ideas. I know.

1097
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,980
I know. Please do not tell the stories of the games.

1098
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,980
If they tried to retell Andromeda story, I wouldn't be as mad, but I just that would be

1099
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,420
such a weird place for them to start.

1100
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,860
It would just remove the whole thing that the game is choice.

1101
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:30,300
I think they have to start with a prequel or something between one and two because they

1102
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,900
have to establish the story.

1103
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,780
There's going to be people that watch this that have never played the games.

1104
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,300
I really don't think they're going to be able to just pick it up in the middle.

1105
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,140
So we'll see.

1106
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:48,380
Anyway, oh, I don't hate this idea from Tiger Claw, a Deep Space Nine type of show taking

1107
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,620
place in the Citadel.

1108
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,580
I don't hate. Yeah, the Citadel had a lot of great stories with it.

1109
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:58,220
And there's a lot of really interesting kind of relationships and things that I and there

1110
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,540
could be interludes at this one's intimate apparel.

1111
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,580
Yeah, you can go you can go right for them to.

1112
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,860
Yeah, I'm you know about that, right?

1113
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,300
Oh, of course, I found that on my fly cam.

1114
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,740
Yeah, yeah, this one's intimate apparel.

1115
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,740
I'm Hannah Lingerie shop.

1116
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,100
I'm sure somebody put it in as a joke thinking nobody would find it.

1117
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
And then people find shit.

1118
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,220
People find it, of course.

1119
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,540
All right, let's move on.

1120
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:30,820
More stories to tell while we await the casting of Shepard and get very disappointed.

1121
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,340
But we're going to hold out hope.

1122
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:37,780
Meanwhile, Loki, what's on our next story now for a different type of disappointment?

1123
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,340
So and now something completely different.

1124
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:48,900
Nintendo has now commented on the whole Activision harassment stories, basically saying that

1125
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,900
they are distressing and disturbing.

1126
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:56,500
You know, Doug Bowser said addressing the whole thing.

1127
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,580
Along with all of you, I've been following the latest developments with Activision Blizzard

1128
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,660
and the ongoing reports of sexual harassment and toxicity at the company.

1129
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,460
I find all of these accounts distressing and disturbing.

1130
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,340
They run counter to my values as well as the Nintendo's police values and policies.

1131
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,940
I mean, yeah, it's pretty basic.

1132
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:22,340
Still, really get more still, Loki, you know, you fucked up when Bowser's looking at you

1133
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,740
going, man, that's pretty fucked up.

1134
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:32,820
Yeah, so and then to kind of respond to all of these things, Activision Blizzard is forming

1135
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:39,060
a workplace responsibility committee that are led by two of the current members of their

1136
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:39,460
board.

1137
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,820
The committee will require management to develop key performance indicators and other means

1138
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,460
of measure progress and ensure accountability.

1139
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,580
The chief executive officer, Bobby Kotick, along with the chief people officer and chief

1140
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,580
compliance officer, will provide frequent progress reports to the committee.

1141
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,020
The committee will be investigating themselves, apparently.

1142
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,340
So literally.

1143
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,300
The worst solution possible.

1144
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,860
We've investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing.

1145
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,860
Bobby Kotick's firing is long overdue.

1146
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,500
Pass it on.

1147
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,700
Like, that's that's I, I am thankful in all seriousness with my Bowser comment.

1148
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,260
I'm very thankful to Doug Bowser for speaking up.

1149
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,380
I'm thankful to all of the game companies for speaking up because that is going to really

1150
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,980
put that pressure on Activision.

1151
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,340
I we've been doing this shit for 19 years.

1152
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,900
I I can't recall a time.

1153
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,940
Granted, I couldn't remember who harmonics really was earlier in the show.

1154
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:45,140
However, I cannot recall a time when Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all come together

1155
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,860
to say this is an issue.

1156
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:50,900
Yeah.

1157
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,220
Yesh.

1158
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,740
Uh, Mike Defton chat says that's what happened in riot.

1159
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,140
Oh, yeah.

1160
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:03,540
The establishing the committee that's made up of the people that need to have oversight.

1161
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,140
Yeah, it's just boy.

1162
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,580
Uh, E3VL in chat says we just need Steam and Valve to get on board.

1163
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,620
You know, I didn't even think about that because I was really honed in on the console.

1164
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,100
But you're right.

1165
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,060
Activision games are sold on the Steam platform.

1166
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,700
So it would be nice for Steam to make a comment.

1167
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,500
However, at this point, just simply all three console manufacturers identifying that there

1168
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:31,380
is a problem, I'm I'm very glad to those executives for stepping up and saying what needed to

1169
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,580
be said publicly when it is a business risk.

1170
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,220
Let's be real.

1171
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,980
It is a business risk.

1172
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,940
Anyway, Bobby Kotick's resignation is long overdue.

1173
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,300
Let's all hope tomorrow's the day.

1174
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:46,100
Meanwhile, I hope by the time you all hear this podcast, he's gone.

1175
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,300
I really, really do, because I would like to talk about that company's products again.

1176
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,820
But meanwhile, we'll talk about Atari.

1177
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,100
How about we talk about Atari instead?

1178
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,980
Well, you know, Atari, Atari's done some interesting things.

1179
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,460
Well, and also Atari isn't Atari anymore.

1180
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,220
You know what Infogrames bought Atari some years ago and Atari's Atari's done some cool

1181
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,740
things, I guess, like the hotel.

1182
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:11,700
I actually think is very interesting, although I've yet to really see one.

1183
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,300
But I find that interesting.

1184
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,860
And Atari's done some things that are not so interesting, like the VCS that oof, oof,

1185
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,360
oof.

1186
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,060
Well, yeah, it sounded cool at the beginning, and then it just got less interesting as it

1187
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:23,540
went on.

1188
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,460
Yeah, well, Atari's made some very interesting moves this week.

1189
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,260
Atari is purchasing Moby Games.

1190
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,780
It's going for 1.5 million and I guess they're going to be taking over what early next year

1191
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,820
or something like that.

1192
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:42,660
Moby Games is a site that I guess if you want to sum it up, it's kind of like an IMDB for

1193
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,380
games has a lot of that sort of stuff.

1194
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:51,940
And actually, ironically, one thing I noticed is that Moby does document the older games

1195
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:56,260
of the Atari 2600 era in television, Commodore.

1196
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,180
It documents a lot of that stuff pretty well.

1197
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:03,540
Like I will try to find obscure Commodore 64 games that maybe there's a YouTube or two

1198
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,140
because, you know, there's a lot on YouTube now.

1199
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:09,620
But literally the only websites that have information is like Moby Games.

1200
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,700
So they do have a pretty impressive database.

1201
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,500
And I guess I see where that's to Atari's benefit because Atari is a retro company as

1202
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,140
well.

1203
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,260
And perhaps this is something that's a tie in to what we talked about last week or the

1204
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:28,020
week before where Atari is doing the limited running game.

1205
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,340
I just want to say limited run games, but that's another company.

1206
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,460
But y'all know what I mean.

1207
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,500
They're doing that kind of like limited publishing thing on their side.

1208
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,300
I could see why maybe they want to tie it into this.

1209
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:43,380
Of course, if I'm a Moby Games super user of which that site is very user driven, it's

1210
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:48,980
Wikipedia-esque in that regard, I can see where I'm kind of freaked out by this idea

1211
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:55,460
because this already happened to them before when Gamefly bought them at one point, changed

1212
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,060
everything, and then Blue Flame Labs bought them and changed it back.

1213
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:04,820
So if I am somebody who spent many volunteer hours helping to keep Moby Games be a great

1214
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,620
website, I'm concerned about this sale.

1215
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,820
And I get this a little bit.

1216
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,380
Quest Buster in chat says Moby Games is such a great resource.

1217
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,620
I found a lot of esoteric games there.

1218
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:20,420
There's also Atari Age out there, which focuses exclusively on Atari releases, trading and

1219
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:20,980
preservation.

1220
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,460
But as far as I know, the new Atari doesn't own them.

1221
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:29,380
Bobby Blackwolf wants to point out, I have a Moby Games profile for my one game credit.

1222
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,220
Somebody made a Moby Games for Flappy Vogue?

1223
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:33,540
I'm just kidding.

1224
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:40,740
Bobby did a soundtrack for a Tetris flavored game in the 90s, so you can find more out

1225
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,100
about that on his show, which I've never played, oddly enough.

1226
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,300
I want to stream it sometime.

1227
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,820
It probably doesn't even run on modern PCs without, like, DOSBox or something.

1228
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,100
SSG100 Matt does point out no pixel poops on Moby Games.

1229
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,660
Matt, it's a user-driven site.

1230
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,180
Somebody just has to add it.

1231
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,060
Loki, where are you at?

1232
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:04,420
Didn't you add it somewhere else so it could get scooped up by...

1233
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,700
It's on the game database.

1234
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,500
That's tied with Twitch.

1235
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,900
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

1236
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,180
Game database for Twitch.

1237
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,460
So, all right.

1238
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,140
That's actually not where things end.

1239
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:24,260
Atari has also mentioned they've invested half a million in the streaming retro platform

1240
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,300
AntStream.

1241
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,140
I've talked about AntStream on this program.

1242
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,820
I used to be a subscriber.

1243
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,900
I was a backer of the Kickstarter.

1244
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,340
I actually no longer am.

1245
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,580
I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

1246
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,820
It's not really shade against AntStream.

1247
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,780
I'm going to explain why in a minute.

1248
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,580
In the quote, Atari says,

1249
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:45,140
the investment in AntStream Limited was made pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that

1250
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:49,620
can be converted into equity of AntStream Limited in a future financing with an initial

1251
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,300
investment of $500,000.

1252
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,940
This is not the first time Atari and AntStream have partnered up.

1253
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:02,900
AntStream is one of the few things that's actually on the VCS where I believe a much

1254
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:10,420
larger Atari library is playable on AntStream if you are streaming it from an Atari VCS.

1255
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:16,340
If you are not and you're on the PC platform, you have a very limited amount of Atari games

1256
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,340
and they add maybe one a week, but sometimes they're deep cuts.

1257
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,220
So it's been a little slow to catch up.

1258
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,180
So I mentioned I used to be on AntStream.

1259
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,380
Why did I stop?

1260
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:31,300
Quite simply, they mysteriously stopped supporting Xbox.

1261
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,540
There is a client for Xbox One that exists.

1262
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,940
There is no client for Xbox Series X.

1263
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,980
I have been a fan of AntStream as far as like, you know, I think the cloud-based stuff for

1264
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,020
retro gaming and I do want to support it from a legal perspective.

1265
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,980
I think it's interesting.

1266
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:52,820
I actually kind of liked that it's a European-based company.

1267
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,540
So a lot of stuff is from a European perspective.

1268
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,220
There's a very heavy MSX.

1269
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,180
I'm sorry, not MSX.

1270
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,380
The other one, ZX Spectrum.

1271
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,340
The other one you couldn't get here.

1272
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:06,820
ZX Spectrum is very heavily on AntStream, which makes sense.

1273
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,540
And a lot of Commodore classics, which you know I love.

1274
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,860
I don't even think you can get on.

1275
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:15,300
Chat, correct me if I'm wrong, but for a long time you couldn't even get on AntStream if

1276
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:15,940
you were in the US.

1277
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,620
You had to be a Kickstarter backer, right?

1278
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:21,780
But maybe they, Dark Tetsuya said ever since they went free to play, he was able to get

1279
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:21,940
on it.

1280
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,220
So maybe that changed.

1281
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:23,540
Sorry.

1282
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,780
But yeah, that's why I stopped with AntStream.

1283
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,380
Like the PC thing is cool, I guess, but I want to be able to play on my Xbox.

1284
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:38,100
And I thought it was really weird because when the Kickstarter happened, they said they

1285
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,460
were going to do PlayStation.

1286
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,620
They had a stretch goal for PlayStation.

1287
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,940
I want to say they had a stretch goal for Switch too.

1288
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,900
I might be wrong.

1289
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,580
It's been a few years since I backed it.

1290
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,660
And the Xbox as well is supposed to be a thing.

1291
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,020
And as far as I'm concerned, as long as they continue to work on these Atari clients and

1292
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,740
they're not delivering on these earlier promises, they're in violation of that Kickstarter

1293
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,260
agreement as far as I'm concerned.

1294
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:06,740
And that's why I have no longer extended my subscription with them.

1295
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:12,420
But that aside, I do mostly have positive things to say about the platform.

1296
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,100
I want to see it succeed.

1297
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,500
I have concerns if it will under Atari's watch, but Atari didn't buy them.

1298
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,980
It just looks like Atari's got a lot of money in them.

1299
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,740
But so, yeah.

1300
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,540
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that was my tweet.

1301
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,820
Yeah, I'm actually digging the vast arcade library and the leaderboards and challenges

1302
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,380
are fun too.

1303
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,580
Pistol pockets in chat says, from what I know, Anstream actually owns Moby Games now, which

1304
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,540
is why Atari may use the option to purchase Moby Games.

1305
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,300
I'm not sure where that comes from.

1306
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,140
I believe Blue Flames, something it's called, is the one that owns Moby Games.

1307
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,220
I think this is just this particular press release getting jumbled a little bit.

1308
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:51,940
I think, and I could, again, I didn't remember who Harmonics was at the beginning of the

1309
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,100
show, so it's very possible I'm in the wrong.

1310
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:59,540
But I am looking at an article that says the current owner is Blue Flame Labs.

1311
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,740
So just for the record.

1312
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,740
Oh, oh, OK.

1313
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:05,220
Thank you.

1314
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,980
Pixel pockets is clarifying.

1315
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:13,140
Blue Flame Labs LLC closed a year ago and Moby Games Limited was created with owners

1316
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,580
from Anstream.

1317
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,220
I was confused as well and looked into it and asked people on the Moby Games Discord.

1318
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:25,620
Oh, well, thank you, because that clearly is research I did not do.

1319
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,300
And that explains a lot.

1320
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,820
So, huh, that is fascinating.

1321
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,340
Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, I can only hope that Atari leaves Moby Games as is, as

1322
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,140
last time one of the buyers redesigned the site years ago.

1323
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:44,180
Yeah, I think it was Gamefly.

1324
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,620
It actually destroyed a lot of its ease of use before it was reverted back under new

1325
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,420
owners.

1326
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,060
That is really interesting what Pixel pockets said, huh?

1327
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,500
Why would Anstream want Moby Games?

1328
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,740
Unless, you know what?

1329
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,980
I'm going to just fire a crazy idea out there.

1330
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:08,740
What if the idea with Moby Games is to make it so that you look up the old games and then

1331
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,860
you play it right there on your browser with Anstream technology?

1332
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,460
I think that's the future right there.

1333
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,260
But again, I'm still waiting on my PlayStation and Xbox clients.

1334
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:20,820
I was promised.

1335
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,100
All right, let's move on.

1336
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,780
More retro goodness, right, DarkSakura?

1337
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,780
Yep, we have some goodies from Taito.

1338
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:36,020
The Taito milestones that was announced for Japan is going to be coming out in the US.

1339
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:41,780
It's due in Japan on February 2022.

1340
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:49,140
It will be including Kix, which makes me happy, Alpine Ski, Frontline, Wild Western,

1341
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:54,980
Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, the Fairyland story.

1342
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:55,940
Fairyland story is fun.

1343
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:03,460
Hailey's Comet, the Ninja Warriors, which, you know, we got on SNES back in the day and

1344
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,700
Arcade and whatnot.

1345
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:10,740
And there's another 10th game to come out that has yet to be announced.

1346
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:18,020
There will be limited and collector's editions for Strictly Limited Games Partner Store

1347
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:22,500
on November 25th, which is already.

1348
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,580
And then, of course, there will be a standard that's for the standard edition and the

1349
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:34,900
collector's edition will be limited to 2,000 copies and the limited will be limited to

1350
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,020
3,000 copies.

1351
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:37,940
So there you go.

1352
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:43,060
That's a neat little collection, though, because you've got some big names in there

1353
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,340
like Kix, but there's a lot of more obscure titles in there, which is pretty cool.

1354
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,860
So it's just more stuff that wasn't really big over here.

1355
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,460
Yeah, but I think it's still really neat.

1356
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,180
So, yeah.

1357
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:53,300
All right.

1358
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,020
You know, I can play Kix for like all day.

1359
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,580
Oh, I know.

1360
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:56,900
I know.

1361
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,660
Kix is a real fun one.

1362
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,700
Excuse me.

1363
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,220
Yyr is in our chat.

1364
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:09,380
Hey, who says, sounds like this is releasing alongside the Taito mini arcade cabinet, which

1365
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,900
is also due in February.

1366
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,460
That's right.

1367
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:16,020
I remember a story on that Taito cabinet does make a lot of sense for that all to come out.

1368
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:16,260
Good.

1369
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:16,500
Good.

1370
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:17,380
All right.

1371
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,060
What can I say, folks?

1372
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:23,060
It's a slower news week, so we let in a few more rumors.

1373
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:27,940
But, Loki, this is a rumor that's kind of coming back, right?

1374
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:30,020
I'm only interested in one rumors.

1375
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,460
Fleetwood Mac.

1376
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,860
Oh, I was going to say the single from Lindsay Lohan.

1377
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:34,260
Close.

1378
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:34,420
No.

1379
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,700
Fleetwood Mac.

1380
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:42,660
So apparently there's a rumor that Chrono Cross is getting a remake.

1381
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:51,300
This was based off of a leak list that was on the, was it Nvidia?

1382
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:57,940
And then there was also some other stuff that was coming from that as well.

1383
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:05,780
Basically saying now that I hear there's the JRPG and multi-platform, I assume PC, PlayStation,

1384
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,340
Switch.

1385
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,380
That's my assumption.

1386
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,500
That's not what I was told, but that's just my assumption.

1387
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,300
So I don't know.

1388
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,420
It's a lot of rumors.

1389
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:22,020
And this is, I guess, coming from as well, like a co-founder, Nick Baker of Xbox era

1390
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,060
podcast.

1391
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:32,420
I'm not really sure how he's affiliated with the Nvidia database leak, but I guess we'll

1392
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,220
wait and see.

1393
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:37,140
Well, what's interesting about this too, is it's not the first time this has come around.

1394
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,700
I remember this was brought up on another show a few months ago.

1395
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,140
And on one hand, it does make a lot of sense because, you know, you have that team that

1396
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,820
did the Secret of Mana reboot and they did the Tales of Mana.

1397
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,260
And that was huge, or Trials, excuse me, of Mana, because, you know, that's the Tales

1398
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,660
of is a completely different series, sorry, Trials of Mana, which, you know, that was

1399
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,340
huge because we actually got that game for the first time in the US and all that good

1400
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:02,840
stuff.

1401
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,380
What are they working on now?

1402
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,220
You know, you would have to imagine they're probably remaking another.

1403
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:12,900
Well, and then they also did, I'm sorry, they did Legend of Mana, the one I like to forget

1404
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,620
about.

1405
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,820
That also got remade.

1406
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:19,860
So it does make sense that, you know, Chrono Cross seems kind of like a target game to

1407
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,980
get a remake.

1408
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:27,140
I'm sure a lot of people are wondering, why won't they touch Chrono Trigger and the big

1409
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:27,940
one?

1410
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,020
I think there might be hesitation.

1411
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,380
I think it's twofold.

1412
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:38,100
I think there might be hesitation that if they fuck it up, it's going to be disastrous

1413
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,540
because a lot of people hold that game in very, very high regard.

1414
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,220
And I just do a third game.

1415
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,600
Right?

1416
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,140
I think that's a brilliant answer as well is just make a third game.

1417
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:55,220
The other thing with Chrono Trigger, I think the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters, I think

1418
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,660
are the true test for that.

1419
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,220
I think they're going to gauge how those Pixel remasters do and potentially do a Chrono Trigger

1420
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:05,700
one with that if those Final Fantasy remasters do well.

1421
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,380
So can I throw out something?

1422
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:07,940
Sure, please.

1423
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,940
Speaking of Chrono Trigger.

1424
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:10,440
Yeah.

1425
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:15,240
So, you know, I was in Alabama for my friend's funeral, right?

1426
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:23,960
One of the last messages that my friend sent me, and I'll have to have to read it, was

1427
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,720
I see a girl with her Nintendo playing Chrono Trigger while you made me love that game.

1428
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,600
Oh, that's a great memory.

1429
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,240
I love that.

1430
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:33,800
Yeah.

1431
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,800
So I have special memories of that game.

1432
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,040
And if they fuck it up, I will be livid.

1433
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,880
And I think there probably is some of that.

1434
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:49,480
I mean, if you fuck up Chrono Cross, you know, like, I'm not like, you know, it'll be all

1435
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:49,800
right.

1436
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,800
You know, that game kind of a lot of people passed on it when it first came out.

1437
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,840
But I think you cannot fuck up Chrono Trigger.

1438
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,040
And I think exactly for that reason and many reasons.

1439
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:05,320
But again, I think they'll go the Pixel remaster route, assuming the Final Fantasy one through

1440
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,120
six remasters do well, which it seems like they've been doing all right.

1441
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,960
I don't know how they're selling, but it seems like the reception to that I should see if

1442
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,560
they're on sale this weekend.

1443
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,120
Probably not.

1444
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,400
But you never know because I still haven't picked them up because I'm being stubborn.

1445
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:24,200
I'm making them release it on Switch or PlayStation or Xbox would be great, too, before I pick

1446
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,760
it up.

1447
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,880
That's for sure.

1448
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,400
I don't know why people are saying Chrono Cross wasn't that good because a lot of people

1449
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:29,800
love it.

1450
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,440
Yeah, I think it's a lot of people who absolutely love that game.

1451
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,040
It's like Legend of Mana, too.

1452
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,880
I think Legend of Mana stinks.

1453
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,360
I know other people that think it's amazing.

1454
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,040
So it's those PlayStation.

1455
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:42,920
It's all a matter of taste.

1456
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,320
Don't say that something sucks when someone else might like it.

1457
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,640
So I mean, unless it has to do with racism or something that sucks.

1458
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,480
Racism always sucks.

1459
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:51,980
All right.

1460
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,600
Okay, one more story.

1461
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,760
And this comes from our Discord.

1462
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,840
So thank you for everybody who is participating in our Discord.

1463
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,080
And if you're not there yet, why don't you join?

1464
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,520
vognetwork.com.

1465
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,760
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1466
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,160
We'll get you in our Discord and folks post stories for us to talk about, such as this

1467
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:18,520
one, which is about a Sony patent that indicates Sony is getting back into mobile.

1468
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,760
Not maybe in the way you think.

1469
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:26,600
Apparently, the patent is for Sony Interactive Entertainment and is patenting a PlayStation

1470
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,160
controller that's designed for mobile gaming.

1471
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,360
It was published by Sony Interactive's Japanese division, and it talks about playing games

1472
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,920
on a device coupled with two controller grips.

1473
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,240
The controller looks a little bit like a DualShock 4, not so much a PlayStation 5, but it's

1474
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,880
literally like a left side grip and a right side grip that your phone kind of goes in

1475
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,600
the center of.

1476
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:54,920
The drawings that are around out there also have a shaft portion that can be tilted by

1477
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,040
the user and it can kind of sense the tilting direction.

1478
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,080
I wonder if that's a PlayStation 3 six axis thing.

1479
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:01,400
I don't know.

1480
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,200
I'm just like, it's a very random, but I wonder if that's like a weird thing.

1481
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,080
What could this all be about?

1482
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,760
Here's my thought on this.

1483
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:17,720
You know, I think it's probably really about trying to expand PlayStation Now and cloud

1484
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:22,440
gaming to mobile, because right now, you know, that's all on Sony devices.

1485
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,840
I would think this is something they're going to look to expand to mobile, whether that

1486
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,480
be through the web, because I know there's been like with Apple, it's been, you know,

1487
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,800
they don't like to have the cloud services on there.

1488
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,080
So it just kind of depends.

1489
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,920
I could go a lot of different directions or maybe it'll stream from your PlayStation.

1490
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,720
Who fucking knows?

1491
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,400
It could go many different ways.

1492
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:48,760
But I think I would think this is them trying to get PlayStation Now and their cloud gaming

1493
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,200
onto mobile devices and using this controller to do that.

1494
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,160
And for all I know, honestly, PlayStation Now is probably already on mobile, but it just

1495
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,280
shows you how much I actually use that service, because I'm going to be honest, there's not

1496
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,960
a lot of compelling stuff on it for me.

1497
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,960
The library isn't quite expansive enough, but maybe they're going to do another push

1498
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,200
on it.

1499
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:08,680
Who knows?

1500
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,200
So maybe they'll put Chrono Cross on it and Legend of Mana and we'll have reasons to

1501
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,880
visit it and pick it up again.

1502
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,200
But I really my gut tells me this is about cloud gaming.

1503
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:25,880
And I think the people that are taking this to a PSP or PlayStation Vita type of place,

1504
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,200
unless you're talking about it streaming from the cloud, I don't think you're right,

1505
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,240
respectfully.

1506
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,600
I think this is literally something that's going to hold the phone that lets you play

1507
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,840
cloud gaming and encourages you to keep a PlayStation.

1508
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,080
It would be neat if it actually streamed from your PlayStation 5, though, kind of like what

1509
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,160
Microsoft's doing with X cloud and all that stuff.

1510
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,600
That'd be kind of cool.

1511
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,480
All right, let's move on.

1512
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:55,000
Let's go back to a simpler time before we had all this cloud gaming in our next segment.

1513
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,800
Here comes the bump.

1514
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:12,920
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1515
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,160
out a classic and tell you about it.

1516
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,880
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1517
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,680
And what did you pick for us tonight, Darzaka?

1518
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,240
I picked Pinball FX.

1519
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:23,720
Good pick.

1520
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:30,360
Pinball FX is a video game to emulate pinball tables.

1521
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:36,120
It came out on Xbox 360, developed by Zen Studios, published by Microsoft Game Studios

1522
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,040
on April 25th, 2007.

1523
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:45,880
It was first released via Xbox Live Arcade, and it had three tables with six more downloadable

1524
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,520
tables and later boards and online multiplayer.

1525
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,960
And it did, of course, have sequels.

1526
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,280
It kind of got mixed reviews.

1527
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,560
It was about the upper level of average.

1528
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:06,040
They said the physics were really good, but they didn't really care for multiplayer with

1529
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,440
it being split screen, although some people were happy that it was there.

1530
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:17,480
And as of July 28th, 2010, it sold over 362,000 copies.

1531
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,040
It was followed by Pinball FX 2.

1532
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,800
It was delisted after Pinball FX 2 came out, but all of the purchases carried over to Pinball

1533
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,520
FX 2.

1534
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:38,920
However, the corresponding tables were not available on the Xbox One version of Pinball

1535
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:44,520
FX 2, but because it is backwards compatible, you can have it installed.

1536
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:52,440
It basically uses the same rules as a pinball table in a virtual environment.

1537
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:02,040
You have your ball on the play field, and you smack it around with your flippers, and

1538
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:07,800
you run it into the bumpers, and you hit ramps, and you do all of the stuff that you do in

1539
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,920
an actual pinball table.

1540
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,160
You have leaderboards, online multiplayer for up to four players.

1541
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:22,120
You win multiplayer by high score, and it came with three tables.

1542
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,240
Starting off, we had Speed Machine, which was a racing theme.

1543
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,880
We had Extreme, which is a skateboarding theme, and Agents, which were secret agents and spies.

1544
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:38,520
There was a fourth one called Buccaneer that was released October 31st, 2007 as a free

1545
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:49,240
download, and then five additional paid ones that had some licensed content on there.

1546
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,160
There was Nightmare Mansion, which was sort of a horror movie one, and then there was

1547
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,720
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

1548
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:05,480
There was Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Earth Defense, which was Alien Invasion, and then the fifth

1549
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:10,200
one Excalibur, which was based off of King Arthur.

1550
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:18,040
Because of the feedback for Pinball FX, then that went into Pinball FX 2.

1551
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,320
Like I said, the first one was a pretty mixed bag.

1552
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:31,560
A lot of people really liked it as a pinball engine, even going so far to compare it to

1553
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,560
Pinball Dreams, which was a pinball sim by Digital Illusions that came out for the Amiga

1554
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,600
in 1992.

1555
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,160
It was one of the big ones at the time.

1556
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:43,640
So good.

1557
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:50,120
Just saying, so good, Pinball Dreams, and that was one of the games I really enjoyed

1558
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,200
playing on Antstream when I had it, actually.

1559
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,720
Ironically enough.

1560
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:08,520
But the thing that I think Pinball FX really set the stage for was now things like Zen

1561
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:15,240
Pinball and all of the other online pinball we have that's allowing those licensed tables

1562
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:15,400
in.

1563
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,320
For the longest time, we had Pin Maim.

1564
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:26,680
And with all the virtual tables, those were very much a labor of love by fans.

1565
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:37,560
But this was one that kind of brought it back into the eye of the home gamer.

1566
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:46,920
And I think that that really, I mean, as a pinball fan, I think that these virtual versions

1567
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:52,680
might have brought just the art and fun of pinball back to people and make them want

1568
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,120
to check out the real thing.

1569
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,720
That's my theory.

1570
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:07,480
Because now you can't go to a real barcade without having more pinball hanging around.

1571
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:13,320
And more and more collectors getting into actual pinball tables and so forth.

1572
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,560
And I think maybe, you know, these games, we just got our Ghostbusters back.

1573
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,680
Oh, that's awesome.

1574
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,360
Yeah.

1575
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:30,040
But I mean, and if I was going to touch on Pinball FX 2, which honestly, I could have

1576
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,920
also done that as a classic game, but it brought in.

1577
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:40,040
I mean, like all kinds of different, like there was a portal.

1578
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,200
There were Marvel ones.

1579
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,160
There was a lot of Marvel ones.

1580
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,360
There was Star Wars.

1581
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:53,720
There was, Alien vs Pinball was another series that was pretty neat.

1582
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,320
I mean, it really opened it up.

1583
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:03,640
And I honestly, now while I still prefer to play a physical table, it's not bad.

1584
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,080
It's really not bad.

1585
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,040
I am down.

1586
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,080
When it's impossible to find the table.

1587
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,120
It's a good pinch.

1588
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:13,560
Yeah.

1589
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:20,840
You know, if you don't feel like standing up either, you know, there's that is something

1590
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,640
you can play from your couch and still kind of get some of the same fun.

1591
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,800
But I will agree.

1592
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,720
The physics are amazing.

1593
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,720
The physics are great.

1594
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,640
But there you go.

1595
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,400
That's our game Pinball FX.

1596
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:38,200
For Xbox Live Arcade, for Xbox 360.

1597
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,080
Lots of people in chat commenting on this.

1598
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,040
Let me get some of these.

1599
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:45,560
Mike Deft in chat says, wait, Pinball FX is over 10 years old.

1600
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,800
It's almost 15, believe it or not.

1601
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,880
It's one of those things that'll age as a gamer.

1602
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,440
That's for sure.

1603
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,480
Dark Tetsuya says, I have a few of the tables that they gave away in FX3, so I played around

1604
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,120
with it a little bit.

1605
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:58,760
It was kind of fun.

1606
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,960
She Hulk 10 in chat says, the game is awesome and it is an excellent simulator.

1607
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,800
And if you buy all the DLC, it's like having 100 pinball machines in your home.

1608
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,560
Great for preservation as well.

1609
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,600
You can also learn how to play the tables as well.

1610
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,240
It has tutorials for actual physical tables.

1611
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,480
You know, that's a great point that She Hulk puts out there because, you know, now that

1612
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,200
Pinball FX has the licenses and they're doing, you know, especially in FX3, you have a lot

1613
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,400
of like licensed tables.

1614
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,600
It gives you those instructions that you don't always have when you walk into the bar, right?

1615
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,880
I mean, everybody kind of just knows how to play pinball.

1616
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:37,320
It's the opportunity to learn the rule set, to learn how to get to the wizard modes, for

1617
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:37,720
example.

1618
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:44,040
Because there are some games, like we were, when we were doing Friendsgiving, one of Dan's

1619
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:48,680
buddies was saying that he just discovered like one of the wizard modes in the new Jurassic

1620
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,200
Park, the newer Jurassic Park.

1621
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:50,760
Yeah.

1622
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,000
I was like, I didn't know this was in here.

1623
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,840
It's a way to really study the game.

1624
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,840
I think would be a really good way to put it.

1625
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,320
You could really go that next layer deeper than you can in a noisy bar playing a dollar

1626
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:05,800
a game, which is a great way to play pinball too, but, um, and, and really study the game.

1627
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,840
And I think that's pretty cool.

1628
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,160
It's also a good way to find some of those obscure tables that you just don't see out

1629
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:11,720
in the wild.

1630
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:12,280
Yeah.

1631
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,160
Yeah, for sure.

1632
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,520
I mean, I mean, that's the newer ones, of course, but I mean, we have to look at where

1633
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,560
it started.

1634
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,200
I thought I saw something about like Pinball FX is kind of like rebranding or, I mean,

1635
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:22,920
they're rebooting.

1636
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,560
They're going back to the not Pinball FX 4, but like a Pinball FX that I think is coming

1637
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,200
out next year.

1638
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,040
I thought I saw something about that floating around somewhere, um, which makes sense.

1639
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,560
It's, it's time to up to the PlayStation 5, the Series X and all that.

1640
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,040
Um, I wouldn't be, wouldn't be surprised.

1641
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:43,400
Um, uh, pod culture and chat says great for those who can't afford tables IRL.

1642
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,960
And Jaskren says, and for those without the space.

1643
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,880
Yeah, that is, that is true.

1644
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:51,160
Uh, oh, Bobby.

1645
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,640
Oh, thank you.

1646
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,520
Bobby Blackwell says Epic Game Store exclusive.

1647
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,160
So the new FX is going to be exclusive to Epic Game Store.

1648
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,880
Interesting.

1649
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:03,960
Is that just on the, um, you know, uh, computing front or are they not going to have it on

1650
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,480
PS5, Xbox Series X?

1651
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,480
That's kind of surprising to me if it skips those, but, um, interesting.

1652
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,560
Well, we'll have to follow and see what happens.

1653
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:12,680
All right.

1654
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,480
Epic Games getting up all those exclusives, I guess.

1655
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:16,840
All right.

1656
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,040
Let's, uh, now we're going to get into, and I mentioned tonight's show is going to be

1657
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:20,840
a little bit shorter.

1658
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,320
So we actually were skipping rapid fire news tonight.

1659
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,840
We've already talked about the news.

1660
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:29,400
Uh, so, uh, what's the Loki OLR, uh, in chat.

1661
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,560
I was about to read this comment, but you're sitting right here.

1662
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,520
What is this you're talking about?

1663
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,020
Loki?

1664
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,160
Oh, you guys said that Pixel Poops number two wasn't on Moby Games.

1665
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:37,800
So I added it.

1666
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,320
Did it work?

1667
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,000
Um, if they have to go through an approval process, so they're like, well, we need it.

1668
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,480
We need something that says shows the release date.

1669
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:50,760
I'm like, Oh, why?

1670
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,260
Okay.

1671
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,400
Um, so I did that.

1672
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,760
And then they're like, well, we can't add it because this company is not in the database.

1673
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,240
Okay, fine.

1674
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,360
I'll have the company of Davis.

1675
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,520
Okay.

1676
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,360
Well, we need proof that this company is a thing.

1677
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,280
Um, hi, I'm the company.

1678
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:04,840
Exactly.

1679
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,160
It's president and CEO at your service.

1680
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:08,760
It's annoying.

1681
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,640
So we'll see it.

1682
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,200
Let me add it pretty quick.

1683
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,600
Uh, the game page needs approval though.

1684
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,180
All right.

1685
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,400
Y'all go up vote or whatever.

1686
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:17,960
I don't know.

1687
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,080
There's nothing you can do.

1688
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:19,560
Okay.

1689
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,240
Your staff has to look at it.

1690
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,880
We need thoughts and prayers since there's nothing to do.

1691
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,680
It doesn't matter.

1692
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,600
You mean nothing will happen then.

1693
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,280
It won't matter.

1694
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:30,920
No one will care.

1695
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,080
Fingers crossed.

1696
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,280
It gets thoughts and prayers.

1697
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:34,760
I know.

1698
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,400
I know.

1699
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:35,880
What else?

1700
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,640
What else can I offer him at this time?

1701
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,840
It's a Hanukkah miracle.

1702
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,040
Okay.

1703
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:40,600
All right, fine.

1704
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,320
I can't, I can't hand out Hanukkah miracles, Jamie.

1705
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,800
You're not a real game unless you put out a Kickstarter.

1706
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,040
That's how it works with NES games nowadays.

1707
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,200
All right.

1708
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,840
Uh, we, we have no rapid fire news tonight.

1709
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,200
So instead we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of

1710
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,480
games coming out very soon, if anything.

1711
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,880
Although actually no, this week we do have a few.

1712
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,440
Uh, let's go to the US, Loki.

1713
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,080
I know of one.

1714
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:11,640
We have, uh, Beyond a Steel Sky that's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation

1715
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,960
5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1716
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:23,000
Uh, Clockwork Aquario that's on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, Evil Genius 2 World

1717
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,120
Domination on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1718
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:38,040
We have, um, Daroku Agents of Sakuratan or Sakuratani, uh, that's on Nintendo Switch.

1719
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,320
Uh, Solar Ash on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.

1720
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:48,520
Uh, Big Brain Academy, Brain vs Brain on Nintendo Switch.

1721
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:55,960
Uh, Chorus on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Stadia.

1722
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,200
Uh, Danganronpa Decadence on Nintendo Switch.

1723
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:00,700
What?

1724
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,480
And a new Danganronpa?

1725
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,180
Yes.

1726
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:11,100
And, uh, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1727
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,860
That's a Disney life simulation game.

1728
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,220
That sounds weird.

1729
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,420
I, I don't think that is a new Danganronpa.

1730
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,260
I think it's a repackaging of the old ones.

1731
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:24,220
Yeah, PesoPockets in chat says that's the package of one to three, isn't it?

1732
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:24,860
Yeah, I think it is.

1733
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:28,780
So I think it's just a, well, there's only two games that are worthwhile in that package

1734
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,280
then.

1735
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,180
All right.

1736
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:35,260
Uh, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases, uh, over there this week.

1737
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:40,380
So on the Nintendo Switch this week, uh, we have Clockwork Aquario is out in Japan as

1738
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:40,940

1739
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:45,100
And we also have this week, Paw Patrol, the movie Adventure City Calls.

1740
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,260
Yes, that is a Japanese release too.

1741
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,300
Um, Disney games do pretty well, um, overseas as well.

1742
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,540
Disney Magic Castle, My Happy Life 2 is also out in Japan this week.

1743
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,940
Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.

1744
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:03,660
Checking out the PlayStation 5 this week, we have also Clockwork Aquario, uh, and we

1745
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:07,260
have that same Paw Patrol movie game as well.

1746
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:14,220
And that Disney Magic Castle, it's literally the same list on the PlayStation 5 as well.

1747
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:17,340
Wait, no, I'm sorry, guys.

1748
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,980
My list bounced up a little bit.

1749
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,260
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1750
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:24,700
Um, dude, was I looking at PlayStation 4?

1751
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,580
There's actually nothing on PlayStation 5 this week.

1752
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:30,220
Okay, it was PlayStation 4.

1753
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,300
All those same things are on PlayStation 4 this week.

1754
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,500
Sorry, my list skipped around because I hit the wrong thing.

1755
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,300
My bad.

1756
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,260
Um, but yeah, those are the releases that are out this week in Japan.

1757
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,540
How about the UK Dark Sakura?

We have a few.

All right, there's your releases for the week.

1772
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,300
One more story for you guys tonight.

1773
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,380
And this is more of a, hey, did you know this?

1774
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:56,060
Speaking about the age of games and so forth, uh, as of November 22nd,

1775
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,340
Rez is now a 20-year-old game.

1776
01:36:59,340 --> 01:36:59,820
That's right.

1777
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:04,380
Rez turned 20 this past week, 20 years old since that game came out.

1778
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:09,500
Um, and what's pretty cool to kind of celebrate that and, uh, mark the occasion for this game,

1779
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,100
uh, the Enhance YouTube channel, um, Enhance, of course,

1780
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:17,180
Tetsuya Mizuguchi's company he's working with now, they're the ones that did Tetris Effect.

1781
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:21,740
Uh, I believe are credited with the Rez VR experience as well,

1782
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:24,940
because both, both those games run in the Synesthesia engine.

1783
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:31,900
I know that Rez VR Area X was a prototype for a new Rez game that didn't happen for whatever

1784
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:32,460
reason.

1785
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:35,900
Maybe it's explained in the documentary because the Enhance YouTube channel actually put up

1786
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:41,180
a short documentary that talks about how the game was conceived, uh, anecdotes, experiences

1787
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:46,540
from people around the industry and, uh, just kind of talking about how everybody back then

1788
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,340
was like, you got to see this, you got to see this, you got to play this game.

1789
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,420
Trans vibrator, you wouldn't believe it.

1790
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,020
So, um, that's pretty cool.

1791
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,540
You know, there was a lot of really cool stuff back in the day, especially on the Dreamcast.

1792
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,180
You know, when you think back to things like Samba de Migo and so forth, and even things

1793
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:03,100
of that era, you know, Parappa the Rappa was really big back then and so forth.

1794
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:06,860
Um, it's, it's awesome that Rez is getting a little bit of love as well.

1795
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:09,820
Uh, and of course, as we know, Rez did get that release.

1796
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:14,780
I just talked about in 2016 with the optional VR, and then there was Area X and all that

1797
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,580
stuff as well.

1798
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:18,620
And it's even on the cloud now it's on Amazon Luna.

1799
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,740
I had no idea.

1800
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,140
So, um, this game is still alive all these years later.

1801
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,740
And I think that is pretty cool.

1802
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:28,060
Um, nowhere mentioned Child of Eden and that's, that's too bad because that game, that's a

1803
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:28,620
great game too.

1804
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:32,460
I know that game should get revisited here and there too, but I'm always, I always am

1805
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,860
looking forward to what Tetsuya Mizuguchi has next.

1806
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:38,780
I think of, of, of probably some, one of my all time favorite game designers, if not

1807
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,700
maybe the all time, who knows?

1808
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:45,580
Um, and if we're done with, uh, with Child of Eden, maybe we can have Angry Adolescent

1809
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,060
of Limbo.

1810
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:53,260
Uh, YYR in chat says Area X was really something right up there with Poly, Poly, Polybius.

1811
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,060
I can never say that again.

1812
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:54,700
Polybius.

1813
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,580
As a must play of the FPSVR.

1814
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,500
That's pretty funny because Polybius doesn't.

1815
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,540
Well, it does now, but yeah, I know what I mean.

1816
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,420
Yeah, I know based off an urban legend and all that stuff.

1817
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:05,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1818
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,660
So I covered it as a classic game.

1819
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:08,220
I know you did.

1820
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,780
I know you did, but how that was a long time ago though.

1821
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:17,180
So yeah, but anyway, uh, YYR does point out Child of Eden is backwards compatible on Xbox.

1822
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,300
Is it now?

1823
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:20,140
I think I have the disc somewhere.

1824
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,180
I need to try it.

1825
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,180
I'd love to play that game again, just for fun.

1826
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:27,020
Cause I think it's kind of like the forgotten about sequel anyway, to that game.

1827
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,260
Well, happy birthday Rez.

1828
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,260
Congrats on 20 years old.

1829
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,260
And, uh, how old does that make you feel?

1830
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:35,420
I know it makes me feel old.

1831
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:35,980
All right.

1832
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,980
Let's talk about the listener round table.

1833
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:42,380
We're going to take your topics in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1834
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:45,740
And then of course, if you want to call in the discords open, uh, if you want to head

1835
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:47,980
over to the green room, we'll take those calls as well.

1836
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,900
Uh, and I want to get to the mailbag.

1837
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,500
I know we have at least one email tonight.

1838
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,700
Let's get to it.

1839
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,260
Ooh, two.

1840
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,900
All right.

1841
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,100
Uh, let's get to it.

1842
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,860
Participate at orangelauntrady.com is the place to send us an email.

1843
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,820
Dar Sakura, take it away.

1844
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,100
All right.

1845
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:06,380
Our first email is hello, Rob Loki and dark Sakura.

1846
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,380
I was thinking about the orange challenge.

1847
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:13,020
Fudio could be replaced with a kind of support chat about diabetes.

1848
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:17,660
Other members of your audience could answer your questions, offer some encouragement and

1849
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:18,780
tips and maybe recipes.

1850
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,900
And we could all offer you some hope and camaraderie.

1851
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,220
We could do a vote among the listeners.

1852
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:29,340
If this is acceptable, my husband is battling pre-diabetes and has the gene on both sides

1853
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:29,980
of his family.

1854
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:34,940
We have started changing our diet as if we have diabetes to help slow his progress and

1855
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,620
to get used to the changes early.

1856
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,940
I know it sucks and feels frustrating.

1857
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:43,020
We just used our emergency money to buy an exercise bike here in Baltimore.

1858
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:47,820
It's not the safest to jog outside all the time and lifestyle changes are overwhelming

1859
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,860
at the moment.

1860
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:50,700
I hope this flattens out for you.

1861
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,220
And it sounds like the changes you've made already are having a positive effect.

1862
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,980
I'll be thinking of you while I eat my salad and water.

1863
01:40:58,700 --> 01:40:59,260
Mere Muse.

1864
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,340
Thank you, Mere Muse.

1865
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:01,980
Thank you for that.

1866
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:06,460
That's a very well-intentioned and great suggestion.

1867
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:11,020
I think my only problem with that and shifting the conversation away from the Fudio thing

1868
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:13,740
to diabetes is I do feel in some way it kind of makes it all about me.

1869
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:18,620
And it's like I'm spoiling the fun of the Fudio event.

1870
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:22,220
Again, I know your suggestion is completely well-intentioned and I think everybody would

1871
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,180
support it.

1872
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:27,100
However, I want my brain to be able to get to a place where I can talk about all the

1873
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,740
food that I used to enjoy and so forth.

1874
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:35,180
The good news I have is that I don't talk to a doctor again for a couple more weeks,

1875
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:41,660
but just in running my numbers because I do the self blood sugar checks with the needle

1876
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:45,260
and all that only a few times a week now, not every day.

1877
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,860
In the beginning, when I was first diagnosed, it was every day, but my numbers were looking

1878
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:52,780
really good after the first week that she cut it back where I only have to check a couple

1879
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,740
times a week.

1880
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,940
And I can say that my levels, the last couple of times I've checked, are coming way down.

1881
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:07,420
For those that speak the language, I tested 107 on Friday and 103 today.

1882
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,740
So I'm getting in a really good place.

1883
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:15,420
So I just kind of want to keep riding that wave and see what my doctor has to say about

1884
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:15,980
it.

1885
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:20,860
I know that it's not something that's going to change overnight, but I'm losing weight

1886
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:25,660
as a side effect of this whole thing since I hit my all-time highest weight this summer,

1887
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,540
as I'm sure a lot of people did during the pandemic.

1888
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,100
I'm now down 14 pounds from that.

1889
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:36,620
So yeah, I didn't lose all at once.

1890
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,740
I don't want people to get concerned.

1891
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,420
There's a certain amount of weight you kind of lose fast at the beginning anyway, and

1892
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:45,500
now it's the slow grind down and all that stuff.

1893
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:51,820
So yeah, I'm going to talk to my doctor, I think I'd be due for that in a week or two

1894
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:55,820
to kind of do the month follow-up and see how it's going and then go from there.

1895
01:42:55,820 --> 01:43:02,300
My hope is that I can, there's no real cure for it, of course, but you can kind of put

1896
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:05,500
it into remission and that's kind of my goal.

1897
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,300
And I think if I lose the weight, I think I might get there.

1898
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,700
Well, I mean, that happened with, I mean, because you know, I've been in, you know,

1899
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:19,180
a number of gastric bypass support groups before when I had, I mean, I wasn't quite

1900
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:26,700
at, I was almost to the pre-levels before my surgery, but I also don't have the genetic

1901
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,060
predisposition towards it.

1902
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:28,940
Right.

1903
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:29,340
And I do.

1904
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,140
Yeah, yeah.

1905
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:30,540
Yeah.

1906
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:37,900
And so right after I had my surgery and dropped my weight, I've been middle of the road,

1907
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,420
no matter what I eat.

1908
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:46,140
And I think that it should be pointed out that there is a lot that is genetic about

1909
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,540
it and not to assume things about people who might be over a certain weight.

1910
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:50,860
Yes.

1911
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:51,420
Thank you.

1912
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,140
It's very important.

1913
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:58,140
And yeah, and again, I want to address the email because I do think it's a very kind

1914
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,980
and very thoughtful suggestion and I really appreciate, you know, again, I think your

1915
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,580
heart is really in the right place for that.

1916
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:07,980
And I obviously am right there with you and your husband and going through the changes

1917
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:08,540
and so forth.

1918
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:13,820
And I'm going to be very transparent and say like, I'm really glad you guys are doing

1919
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:18,380
something about it now because I didn't get the courtesy of a pre-diabetes phase.

1920
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,180
I didn't get that.

1921
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:23,180
So, and that's the most frustrating thing about this whole situation.

1922
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:29,340
So the fact that you guys are like doing something about it now, I think really speaks to you

1923
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,260
guys in a positive way and so forth.

1924
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,980
Now, here's the other thing I kind of want to say with that.

1925
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:37,180
Even though I'm a little uncomfortable saying, okay, I want to take this orange launch video

1926
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:40,860
thing and now, no, it has to be all about me because I came down with diabetes.

1927
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:46,540
Even though I'm a little hesitant to do that, I am now going to be speaking from a place

1928
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:51,500
where that's just part of me and that's something that I'm living with and that's just who I

1929
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,220
am.

1930
01:44:52,220 --> 01:45:00,700
And genetics, fatness, or otherwise, I'm not going to shy away from the conversation about

1931
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:03,020
it sucks to have diabetes.

1932
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:09,420
It's very similar to the fact that I've been out and gay on this show for nearly 20 years

1933
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,500
and I don't apologize for that either.

1934
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,020
And I talk about my husband pretty openly because that is the life I live.

1935
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:22,860
And if that's not something you're comfortable hearing, tough titty because that's my life.

1936
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:29,580
So I kind of think to kind of go to your, like back to your email and everything, I

1937
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:33,740
think when we do orange launch video, and I think I will get there, I will get to a

1938
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,260
mental place where I'll be able to do it.

1939
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:38,940
I'm going to speak to things from this perspective because that's my life now.

1940
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:42,620
And that's, you know, who a part of who I am.

1941
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,460
And I think folks understand that.

1942
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,740
And yeah.

1943
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,580
That's me with my autism.

1944
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:50,460
Yes, it is me with my surgery.

1945
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:50,960
Yes.

1946
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:55,420
It's just everyone has a different experience.

1947
01:45:55,580 --> 01:46:02,060
And we all come from a place of our own experiences.

1948
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:09,180
And that needs to be understood when people talk about these things.

1949
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:15,660
So I think that honestly, I don't think that it would be making things about about you.

1950
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,820
Just saying, I think.

1951
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:21,660
And I'm admitting that's, that's a personal sort of crisis I'm having.

1952
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:22,540
If that makes sense.

1953
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:23,040
Yeah.

1954
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:28,800
But I think it's something that could at least be involved in the discussion.

1955
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,300
Maybe.

1956
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,400
Talk about if I'm there, it will like that.

1957
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,840
That's my, that's kind of my point, right?

1958
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,360
That's not quite what I meant.

1959
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,000
Okay.

1960
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,800
Talk about like proper, you know, just nutrition in general.

1961
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,920
You know, talk about habits, talk about mindfulness.

1962
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:52,720
You know, it, it goes in with the discussion about food in general.

1963
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:57,520
And then how bad that I was when I went to Taco Bell.

1964
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:04,160
But at the same time, like if you like, you know, to go, even though I talked about a lot

1965
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:08,160
of good things, just for shits and giggles, I never do this.

1966
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,360
But since I have the home testing kit, I decided, you know what?

1967
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,360
I'm going to test myself after Thanksgiving dinner.

1968
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,320
And I didn't go overboard with Thanksgiving dinner.

1969
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,600
But we go out as we did every year and I got, you know, ham as I always do.

1970
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,880
I ate a lot of vegetables.

1971
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,000
But I had a little bit.

1972
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,240
I had maybe half the mashed potatoes, which is, you know, a little bit carby.

1973
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,680
And I ate a piece of pumpkin pie.

1974
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,320
I said, you know what?

1975
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,840
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

1976
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,360
I'm having a fucking piece of pumpkin pie.

1977
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,360
Tested myself when I got home.

1978
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,200
257.

1979
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,360
No, geez.

1980
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:42,080
So, which is not good for those that don't speak the language.

1981
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,160
I don't know if that's a matter of just maybe I tested at the wrong time.

1982
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,960
I waited two hours or at least I tried to, I don't know.

1983
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,520
It could be a variety of things, but I would have tested after 24 hours, to be honest.

1984
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,040
Well, see, but that's the crazy thing.

1985
01:47:55,040 --> 01:48:00,000
The next day in the morning, I have my lowest reading yet.

1986
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,880
So it's this weird thing where, like, my body is like spiking like crazy with.

1987
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,360
And, you know, yeah, I know I did a bad.

1988
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,480
I'm not supposed to have pumpkin pie.

1989
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:10,880
I did.

1990
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,000
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

1991
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,120
Let me have this.

1992
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,040
If we don't do the nice thing for ourselves once in a while, like the Taco Bell.

1993
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,840
That was not a nice thing.

1994
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,280
Well, OK, the Swedish meatballs like you, whatever it is for you.

1995
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,960
And I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to cheat every month or anything like that,

1996
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,480
but it's one of those things where it's like, but even when I had the Thanksgiving dinner,

1997
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,480
I was like, I'm not going to put butter on the bread.

1998
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,440
I can skip that.

1999
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,680
I'm not going to have sweet tea like I usually do.

2000
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,520
I'm going to skip that and have unsweet tea.

2001
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,000
I still cut corners, you know, and I still and then I walked 10,000 steps the next day.

2002
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,720
So, you know, there are still things.

2003
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:48,160
But anyway, that's a whole nother.

2004
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,120
I'm getting off track.

2005
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,480
Thank you for the email.

2006
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,760
Thank you for the suggestion.

2007
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,560
And my thoughts are certainly with your husband and yourself.

2008
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,800
And thank you for being there to support him because I can tell you.

2009
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,800
I don't want to get emotional, but if I didn't have Alan right now.

2010
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,360
This would be a very dark place.

2011
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,320
This would be a very, very dark place if I didn't have Alan right now.

2012
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,520
That is all I'm going to say.

2013
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,000
And I think you all can read between the lines on that.

2014
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,960
SSG100Matt in chat says, hoping for the best for you, Rob,

2015
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,440
both physically and mentally while you go through this.

2016
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,160
I will take it.

2017
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,880
I will take your thoughts and prayers on this

2018
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,720
because there is literally nothing else anyone can do.

2019
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,800
This is a me thing that I have to work through.

2020
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,000
There's literally nothing else you can do.

2021
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,040
So I'll take it and I appreciate it.

2022
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,320
Honestly, it's all in your hands.

2023
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:44,820
Yes.

2024
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,920
Because the only one who's going to be able to make the healthy decisions and enact it is you.

2025
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:52,720
And we can all support you.

2026
01:49:54,480 --> 01:50:00,000
What I tell people all the time anyway is that things don't change in our lives

2027
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,160
until we do what we need to to make them change.

2028
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,560
And that's practically with anything.

2029
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:08,560
So I have to say, I'm really proud of you.

2030
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,880
And I know, yeah, maybe it was necessity that pushed you to it,

2031
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,280
but I'm still really proud that you're doing what you need to,

2032
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,720
because I have a friend who's completely failing at managing hers.

2033
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,200
Thank you.

2034
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,840
And I met somebody as well who told me they have it,

2035
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,480
and I had no idea because they don't do anything about it.

2036
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,480
And it kind of surprised me.

2037
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,520
I have to be honest.

2038
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:34,320
So the things my body was doing, I couldn't really ignore it.

2039
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:39,600
I have to, but I've been approaching it as a,

2040
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,200
this is God and I'm using my quotey fingers, whatever you believe in.

2041
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,240
I'm using my quotey fingers.

2042
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,360
This is supreme being telling me I need to go on a diet.

2043
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,440
And so, okay, you know what?

2044
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,760
Sure, I'll go on a dog.

2045
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,800
I'll try to get skinny like I was in high school.

2046
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,040
I don't think I'll get all the way there, but why not?

2047
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,920
I'll lose a few pounds and see where that puts us.

2048
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,280
And go from there.

2049
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,360
So, and I see your muses in chat.

2050
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,560
Thank you again for the email.

2051
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,520
Thank you for supporting what your husband is going through.

2052
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,800
It's again, like I said, the spousal support is huge.

2053
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,760
Huge, huge, huge.

2054
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,520
Anyway, and I was gonna say, the other thing that friends can do,

2055
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:25,440
like don't, like the thing that dark soccer and Loki and so forth,

2056
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,080
the thing they can do, don't fucking bring a pie here

2057
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,400
or don't bring cookies here and don't bring candy here.

2058
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,400
Like that, you know, you all know that now.

2059
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,640
And we all know we used to do that, but things are different now.

2060
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,080
We know things now we didn't know then.

2061
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,640
And so it's different now, but you guys in chat,

2062
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:44,880
I don't think there's a lot you can do with not bringing over cake.

2063
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,760
So I'll take your thoughts.

2064
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,520
And besides that, I'm pretty good at sugar-free pies.

2065
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:52,720
Oh, that's good.

2066
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,240
That's good.

2067
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,800
Hey, I did the low carb thing for like how long?

2068
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,600
Trust me, I can make a low carb pie.

2069
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,100
No.

2070
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:01,380
All right.

2071
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:02,500
You said we had a second email.

2072
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:03,800
Yeah.

2073
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,300
Hello, LR, I just wanted to share a few random thoughts

2074
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,820
as well as some reactions of mine to slightly older episodes.

2075
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:12,660
Maybe you remember, or maybe you don't,

2076
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:17,380
that Neko Atsume VR, a virtual reality adaptation

2077
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,380
of everyone's favorite mobile cat collecting game

2078
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,260
was released a few years ago for Japanese PS4s.

2079
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:22,900
Do you remember?

2080
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:26,900
I have almost enough credit in my Japanese PSN account to buy it.

2081
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,460
So every so often I check to see if it went on sale.

2082
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,940
This time, however, suffered something even better.

2083
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:35,060
Neko Atsume VR is now available in North America.

2084
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,060
It was released just this past August.

2085
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:40,740
For only $17, you can relive the joy and thrills of Neko Atsume

2086
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:44,020
in glorious first generation PlayStation VR.

2087
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,780
So if you're interested, pounce on that.

2088
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:46,280
Good tip.

2089
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,620
You recently mentioned Mega Man Battle Network

2090
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:51,300
as classic game of the week.

2091
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:53,140
One of the chat comments mentioned

2092
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,060
that they would love to see a successor.

2093
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,900
Well, a successor already exists.

2094
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,740
It's called One Step From Eden,

2095
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,420
and it's a deck-building roguelite

2096
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,980
that uses Battle Network's grid-based battle system

2097
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,700
as its basis.

2098
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:07,060
Along with a lengthy single-player campaign,

2099
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:09,860
it also features local PVP and co-op.

2100
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:12,980
Steam's user reviews are overwhelmingly positive,

2101
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:16,340
and it's available in every modern console and PC platform,

2102
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:17,700
yes, including Mac.

2103
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,100
So if you enjoyed Battle Network back in the day,

2104
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,700
you really ought to check it out.

2105
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:25,860
While playing Forza Horizon 5, I realized something.

2106
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,820
A lot of folks just say that it's Forza Horizon 4

2107
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:31,220
on a different map, and in a way, it is.

2108
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,460
But this doesn't give credit to the massive number

2109
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,540
of new features, refinements, and improvements

2110
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:37,540
that were made to Forza Horizon 4

2111
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:39,860
since it launched back in 2018.

2112
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,380
If you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch

2113
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,700
to Forza Horizon 4 today, yes,

2114
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,660
they look almost like the same game on two different maps.

2115
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:52,180
However, if you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch

2116
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:55,220
to day one version of Forza Horizon 4,

2117
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:57,620
you will see a generational leap

2118
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,740
that is in almost every respect,

2119
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,820
and I wish more folks would recognize this.

2120
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:04,900
Anyway, that's it now from me.

2121
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,340
Thanks again for the show as always,

2122
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,460
and have a great week.

2123
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:11,060
Trying to shake off post-holiday doldrums, YYR.

2124
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:13,300
Thanks, YYR.

2125
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:16,660
And for those that are saying that Forza Horizon 5

2126
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,660
is just more Forza Horizon 4,

2127
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,020
why is that a bad thing?

2128
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:24,580
It's like continuing this great song,

2129
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,740
this great adventure, this great movie

2130
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:28,420
with more of what you love.

2131
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:30,100
But yeah, I also do agree.

2132
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:34,180
Certainly the step up to series X and series S,

2133
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,620
I know YYR has been playing on,

2134
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:38,180
but that step up to be able to do that

2135
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:40,980
from a graphical perspective just makes the game look

2136
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:42,420
even that much better.

2137
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,340
And just, I think there's a lot to appreciate.

2138
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:46,900
I do see a step up,

2139
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:50,020
but maybe I get that it's not the same step up

2140
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,380
from three to four, two to three,

2141
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,100
but why is that bad?

2142
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,340
It's getting to the point where Forza Horizon

2143
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,140
is so fucking good.

2144
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,500
It's consistently a 90 plus critic reviewed game.

2145
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,940
Not that it matters what the critics think,

2146
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:03,540
but when they all are saying the same thing,

2147
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:04,980
you can't help but listen.

2148
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,820
It's constantly a 90 plus game.

2149
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:09,380
How much better can we make it?

2150
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,980
It's got a good formula.

2151
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:11,620
Go with it.

2152
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:14,820
So Mike Defton Chat says,

2153
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,620
it's not a bad thing,

2154
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:17,860
but that doesn't make it a game of the year contender.

2155
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:18,900
And Bobby Blackwell says,

2156
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,660
Deft, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

2157
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,900
And I am gonna side with Bobby on this one.

2158
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:26,580
I will give Deft this.

2159
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:31,220
I understand that that is probably the reason

2160
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,380
it's getting overlooked for game of the year

2161
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:36,100
is that it's a little too repetitive for some.

2162
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:39,060
It's like, oh, well, four already did this.

2163
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,220
So why would we nominate five game of the year

2164
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:42,180
when four did this?

2165
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:44,260
But I'm of the mindset where it's like,

2166
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:46,180
well, you didn't give four game of the year.

2167
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,420
At some point, you need to acknowledge

2168
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,940
what the series is doing.

2169
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:51,780
And at some point you need to...

2170
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:54,820
It's like that person that's long overdue

2171
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,940
for their fucking Oscar.

2172
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:58,820
At some point, Glenn Close better win a fucking Oscar.

2173
01:55:58,820 --> 01:55:59,320
Am I right?

2174
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:03,060
So there's just that whole thing.

2175
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:07,060
So anyway, as Joe and Hunter Matt puts in chat,

2176
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,740
not many games make it to game five.

2177
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,820
At some point, you got to give the series an award.

2178
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,020
Big, strong agree.

2179
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:15,220
But at the same time, awards aren't everything.

2180
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:18,100
I know the Grammy Award nominations came out this week.

2181
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:21,060
And I have to say, I don't give a fuck about the Grammys.

2182
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:24,340
It's been pointed out many times,

2183
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:26,340
many issues with the Grammys.

2184
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,700
Go look at what The Weeknd had to say

2185
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,900
about the whole thing last year.

2186
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:31,780
My understanding is, though,

2187
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:34,100
and of course I'm going to smile and go,

2188
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:34,980
all right, that's cute.

2189
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,660
ABBA got nominated.

2190
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:39,220
You all know I love ABBA from the 70s, right?

2191
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:43,460
ABBA got nominated for their first ever Grammy this week

2192
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,340
because I still have faith in you.

2193
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,060
The reunion single got nominated for song of the year,

2194
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:50,420
record of the year, one of those two things.

2195
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,100
And I'm just sitting here going,

2196
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,900
the greatest pop band of all time,

2197
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:55,700
in my humble opinion,

2198
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,380
the greatest pop band of all time

2199
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:59,620
getting nominated for their first Grammy

2200
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:01,620
just now in the year 2021

2201
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,860
says all you need to know about why the Grammys are terrible.

2202
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,580
I'm surprised they didn't get nominated

2203
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,020
for best new artist, to be honest.

2204
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,420
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

2205
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:14,180
oh yeah, speaking of the game awards,

2206
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:17,220
do we want to apply for an official co-stream for that, Rob?

2207
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:17,860
Sure, yeah.

2208
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,660
What was the time that it starts?

2209
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,980
It doesn't start earlier than five Pacific, right?

2210
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:25,300
I don't think it does.

2211
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:27,620
As long as it's not earlier than five Pacific, I can do,

2212
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,060
oh wait, I take that back.

2213
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:29,780
What am I thinking?

2214
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:30,900
I can do four Pacific.

2215
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:34,180
So as long as, okay, that great.

2216
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:35,780
Sounds good.

2217
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:37,700
Next next Thursday.

2218
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,180
Yeah, since it looks like getting down there to LA

2219
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:42,340
is probably not going to happen for a multitude of reasons.

2220
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,460
So that's fine.

2221
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,300
I like what Jaskren said in chat.

2222
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:47,140
Art is not a competition.

2223
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,260
I like that.

2224
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:48,980
It's very good.

2225
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,180
You know what?

2226
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:51,700
Your game of the year probably was,

2227
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,460
there's probably gonna be lots of people's game of the years

2228
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:54,340
that weren't nominated.

2229
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:56,340
And that's, that's what it is.

2230
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,140
That's funny.

2231
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:59,620
Art is to a competition with yourself

2232
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:00,580
cause it's never done.

2233
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:03,060
All right.

2234
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:03,780
Fair perspective.

2235
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:06,340
Ooh, I'm almost missing a call in the green room.

2236
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:07,700
I don't want to do that.

2237
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:09,780
Let's get, yeah, I got to go to the green room and say,

2238
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,380
hello, you're on orange lounge radio.

2239
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:11,940
Who's this?

2240
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,340
Hey, what's going on everybody?

2241
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,060
It's Rama.

2242
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,420
Hey Rama, it's good to hear from you.

2243
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,660
Right back at you.

2244
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:22,260
As you can see, I actually left the house for Thanksgiving.

2245
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:22,820
What?

2246
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:24,100
Leaving the house?

2247
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:24,900
Overrated.

2248
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,580
Who does that anymore?

2249
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,740
I know it's a new thing.

2250
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:32,820
And besides, I wore my mask and it was a very nice

2251
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:36,980
Thanksgiving feast followed by laying around,

2252
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:40,180
watching TV and doing Black Friday shopping online

2253
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,540
where everything is delivered to the house.

2254
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,220
You know, very chill stuff.

2255
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,740
That is a great, that's, you know,

2256
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:48,180
between the walking and everything,

2257
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:51,460
I spent a lot of my extended weekend playing video games

2258
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,140
and that felt very good.

2259
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,500
SSJ100Matt in chat says,

2260
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,900
putting on pants is very overrated.

2261
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:57,380
Truth.

2262
01:58:58,100 --> 01:58:58,500
Truth.

2263
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,060
It depends on your version of pants.

2264
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:02,420
Cause some people need to wear underwear.

2265
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,140
US pants.

2266
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,100
Hey, that works.

2267
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,100
That works.

2268
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:13,140
And before I want to talk about what I want to call in,

2269
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:14,900
I just want to say that, you know,

2270
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:18,820
while I was doing my shift on Friday, working from home,

2271
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:19,620
I figured, you know what,

2272
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:21,780
let me turn on the switch and play some games.

2273
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:24,260
I ended up finding myself looking at Paramount Plus

2274
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:27,140
and watching a documentary called Console Wars.

2275
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:30,180
But what was great about it was from Sega's point of view.

2276
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:31,380
So it was really interesting.

2277
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:31,880
Ooh.

2278
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,860
I don't think I've seen that one.

2279
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:34,500
I have to look that up.

2280
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,940
I think I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it.

2281
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:36,660
I need to look that up.

2282
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:38,500
I just stumbled upon it.

2283
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:41,140
I'm like, 16-bit graphics.

2284
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,340
Let me see what this is all about.

2285
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,220
Oh, wow.

2286
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:45,780
This is from the other side.

2287
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:46,660
This is good.

2288
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,900
Paramount Plus has some good stuff on it, I got to say.

2289
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:51,220
Like, again, I'm not being paid to shill them,

2290
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:56,180
but I know there's a lot of talk about everybody's got their own streaming service.

2291
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,300
But I get that.

2292
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:01,700
But I will say, you know, because Paramount Plus was the CBS thing,

2293
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:02,580
which was kind of weak.

2294
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:04,980
It's a lot stronger now.

2295
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:05,700
I will say this.

2296
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,660
Like, the fact they're getting, like,

2297
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:09,140
international versions of Survivor is super cool to me.

2298
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:13,140
And that real-world reunion, they just started.

2299
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:14,980
So I don't know if you guys even know this.

2300
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:18,900
The real-world Los Angeles, which, like, that was when I was in high school.

2301
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:22,900
Like, that was, like, growing up on, like, that series and watching it on TV.

2302
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,260
That was reality TV, right?

2303
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,100
Okay, so there was a girl from Alabama.

2304
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:27,300
I was like, oh, my gosh.

2305
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,340
Get this, Dark Sakura.

2306
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:33,300
So what they did all these years later, it's a Paramount Plus exclusive show.

2307
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,620
They got all of the original.

2308
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,220
So they did it for the first one, New York.

2309
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:40,260
They got all of the original cast together, except for one guy,

2310
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:41,860
because he tested positive for COVID.

2311
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:47,140
And they put them in a similar apartment and put them there for a week to revisit everything.

2312
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:51,860
Well, they just debuted the second season with the LA cast.

2313
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:57,460
And let me tell you, that cast has some history and they really get into it.

2314
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:59,460
And you want to talk about alternate points of view.

2315
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,580
Because everybody knows about, like, that hallway incident.

2316
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:04,980
Like, that was television, right?

2317
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:06,900
Is that the cast that had Pedro?

2318
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:07,860
No, that was three.

2319
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,140
That got dice here.

2320
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:09,780
Yeah.

2321
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:12,660
Apparently, they're skipping from two to nine.

2322
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:14,260
They've already renewed it for a third season.

2323
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:17,460
They're going to go all the way to the New Orleans one, because for whatever reason,

2324
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:21,460
I would imagine the San Francisco one just they could not get enough.

2325
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:23,700
Like, there's always someone who sits it out.

2326
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:26,340
Obviously, we lost Pedro, and that is horribly tragic.

2327
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:29,460
But I think with San Francisco, they probably I doubt, you know,

2328
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:31,300
that conservative girl that's been on the view.

2329
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:32,740
She's not going to fucking do it.

2330
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:35,460
Uh, and a lot of those people in the cast are not going to do it.

2331
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:39,060
But the L.A. people, I was surprised they got a lot of those people to do it.

2332
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:42,580
There's a couple missing, but they got the people that were involved in that

2333
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,100
whole thing with the trying to pull the girl's clothes off

2334
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,500
with the blanket and dragging down the hallway.

2335
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,780
I remember that.

2336
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:50,020
Yeah.

2337
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,380
See, that was very, very.

2338
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:52,740
That was disgusting.

2339
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:54,820
And they get into it.

2340
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:57,860
And you you want to talk about hearing it from another point of view.

2341
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,220
You find out things.

2342
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,300
I'm not going to spoil it for those of you.

2343
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,580
You hear her talk about things that she was dealing with at the time

2344
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:07,620
that she never disclosed when she was doing the show.

2345
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,340
And it makes you look at that from a whole new light.

2346
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:13,940
And it's it's really, really interesting.

2347
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:16,180
And the aggressor is still right there.

2348
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:20,420
And at least at the end of the first episode, he wasn't totally hearing it.

2349
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:25,300
He really wasn't still still all these years later really understanding it.

2350
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:29,780
It was just it was really it's hard to watch in some ways.

2351
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:31,300
And they have a car intent warning on it.

2352
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:34,660
But I thought it was so interesting all these years later, for sure.

2353
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:36,900
I might have to look on like YouTube or something.

2354
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:37,460
Yeah.

2355
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,900
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to.

2356
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:43,060
I didn't mean to show Paramount Plus during your call, Rama.

2357
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:47,620
But I will say, like there is I know they've been getting a lot of shit

2358
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:50,820
about Star Trek Discovery in Europe as they should.

2359
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:53,620
But at least here in the US, it's got a lot of good shit.

2360
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:57,780
Jaskren says the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga concert also aired tonight on Paramount Plus.

2361
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,220
Really?

2362
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,180
I'm going to watch it.

2363
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:02,180
They have the Madame X Madonna thing, too.

2364
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:06,420
I got to say, Paramount Plus is I get why people dog on it.

2365
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,420
But at the same time, they've got some really good shit.

2366
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,500
Like they're up and coming pretty good.

2367
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,460
And yes, they did.

2368
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,820
They fixed the Discovery thing.

2369
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:18,340
They're putting it on Pluto TV, which is Viacom's free thing in the UK.

2370
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:20,180
So I don't know how that all works.

2371
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:22,740
But yes, the UK gets Discovery after all.

2372
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:24,420
Anyway, Rama, I'm sorry.

2373
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,500
What did you actually call that tonight?

2374
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,620
Not streaming TV.

2375
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:30,500
Because you mentioned Gaga, I'm going to.

2376
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,700
Are you going to see House of Gucci?

2377
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:32,260
Yes or no?

2378
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:38,020
No, because my friends that have seen it have all said it's not great.

2379
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:41,060
Like it's not bad, but it's not great.

2380
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:45,940
And just watch it when it's on Paramount Plus or whatever service it's on.

2381
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:46,820
That's what I've heard about.

2382
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:47,380
Sounds good.

2383
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:51,380
You know, I love me some Gaga, though, but can I sit there for two and a half hours when

2384
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:53,300
she's only in like 15, 20 minutes of it?

2385
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:53,700
I don't know.

2386
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:55,860
Fair enough.

2387
02:03:56,580 --> 02:04:04,100
So what I want to talk about real quick is along the lines of the whole Bobby Kotek drama,

2388
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:10,100
because we had something similar happen out here a few years back at a local convention

2389
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:11,140
to summarize.

2390
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:12,660
We had a con chair.

2391
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:19,220
He was one of those where if there was any issues whatsoever, you talk directly to him.

2392
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:23,620
He was always on the floor talking to people and he would do whatever he could to take

2393
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:24,340
care of it.

2394
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:29,300
Well, there were some harassment issues coming that he was aware of.

2395
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:32,340
So he did the right thing as the con chair.

2396
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:35,300
He brought it up to the board and explained what was going on.

2397
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:40,900
There were some department heads who thought that their shit didn't stink as well as harassing

2398
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:41,860
other people.

2399
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:47,220
And from my understanding, the board was basically like the boys club.

2400
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:52,820
So as much as my friend, who was the con chair, kept bringing it up and trying to fix things,

2401
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:55,380
he ended up stepping down.

2402
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:56,980
He says, I can't do it anymore.

2403
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:01,380
It was basically him against the world and he couldn't fight it.

2404
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:13,620
So we have a new con chair come in and things got a lot worse and I can later send you links

2405
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:15,460
to articles in regards to it.

2406
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:18,660
But let's just say the harassment continued.

2407
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:22,100
The con chair just threw a blind ear to it.

2408
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:26,340
He was also like, well, if you scratch my back, I scratch your back, too.

2409
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:31,300
You know, it got to the point where people got tired of it.

2410
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:39,060
He stepped down and now we have a new con chair running this convention and he's basically

2411
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:42,100
unfucking everything that had happened.

2412
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,660
So but the board is all still there.

2413
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:49,860
Far as I know, a couple of members of the board are still there.

2414
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:55,700
The issue is with a lot of anime conventions is that it starts out as a fun thing.

2415
02:05:55,700 --> 02:06:00,420
And then when you realize what you can do and what power you have, it goes to your head

2416
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:03,220
and it's like, yeah, there you go.

2417
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:04,580
You could do whatever you want.

2418
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:06,180
It's like, oh, it's fine.

2419
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:06,980
We could do this.

2420
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:08,420
It's fine to do that.

2421
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:09,860
No, it is not.

2422
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:16,340
This is one of the reasons why I don't staff conventions anymore, because I can tell you

2423
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:20,100
stories of things I have seen, I have heard and I'm like, you know what?

2424
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,260
I this is something I cannot do.

2425
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,980
Nobody's holding the board accountable.

2426
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:27,540
And that's your common denominator with the Activision story.

2427
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:28,660
Right.

2428
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:35,460
But I will say the difference is that one person tried to basically fight the board.

2429
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:37,540
And so I just can't do it.

2430
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:40,260
And I understand this all so much.

2431
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:45,460
And what bothers me the most is that you're the con chair.

2432
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:46,340
You're on the board.

2433
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:48,180
You are basically the head guy.

2434
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:50,820
And everybody else is like, yeah, no.

2435
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:58,900
I mean, one person harassed a friend of mine to the point where she will not attend the

2436
02:06:58,900 --> 02:06:59,940
convention anymore.

2437
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:06,180
She filed multiple grievances and complaints because he was friends with people on the

2438
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:06,660
board.

2439
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:08,340
They went to deaf ears.

2440
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:12,900
And unfortunately, that's what it's going to take for the board to fight.

2441
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:18,980
It's like I said, and you agree when I said money, you said, uh huh.

2442
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,260
And that's what it's going to take.

2443
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:22,980
Lack of money to change the tone.

2444
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:26,260
And that is the common denominator with the Activision thing.

2445
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:30,340
Now, of course, in the Activision thing, you also have a toxic, poisonous CEO who won't

2446
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:32,180
get out of there and the board's protecting him.

2447
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:35,700
I mean, none of these people threaten to kill anyone, at least as far as I know.

2448
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:40,740
But my point is, is that it's going to take the shareholders starting to oust the board

2449
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:46,100
members and holding those types of elections in order and as the only way that will happen

2450
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:48,100
is if Activision continues to lose money.

2451
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:51,060
I do want to point out Activision is losing money this year.

2452
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:56,740
If you look at their stock and this is beyond just that recent dip in this, I mean, that

2453
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:01,060
doesn't help, but this is beyond the recent Omnicron dip in the stock market.

2454
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:08,900
This is Activision has been trending downward because this leak of stuff will not I guess

2455
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:13,220
that's not not the right way to put it, but this this toxic leak will not get plugged

2456
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:13,860
up.

2457
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:15,540
Bobby Kotick is still there.

2458
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:24,020
And you know what, Rob, the sad part is, is that regardless of what's going on at Activision,

2459
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:27,300
people are going to pick up and play the games because, oh, this is my game.

2460
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,100
I want to play it.

2461
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:28,820
You shouldn't play.

2462
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:29,460
Let's go.

2463
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:29,940
I don't care.

2464
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,380
I want to play that game.

2465
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:36,020
Like I could tell you about issues with various conventions.

2466
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:43,620
There is one guy who runs multiple conventions and he is a known registered sex offender.

2467
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:45,140
But you know what?

2468
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:51,300
People still go to his conventions because of their friends that are going, the guests

2469
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,980
that are appearing and all that.

2470
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,940
And he has screwed the guests in the past.

2471
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:57,780
He has screwed the hotels in the past.

2472
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:02,020
He's not even allowed to be in certain hotels because he owes them money.

2473
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:02,820
But you know what?

2474
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:06,500
He continues to run these conventions and people will go.

2475
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:11,620
It's like any reason to go to a convention equals to any reason to buy the game.

2476
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:17,060
I guarantee you Activision can have a fire sale on the latest Call of Duty and put it

2477
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:19,380
out and say it's $19.99.

2478
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:23,220
The sheer number of people that will go that will that will buy it.

2479
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:24,020
Just saying.

2480
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:24,520
Sure.

2481
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,180
You know what, though?

2482
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,580
I'm putting my foot down no more.

2483
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:29,700
Not on my watch.

2484
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:30,740
I'm one person.

2485
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:34,180
Maybe I don't matter, but it's got to start somewhere.

2486
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:36,020
Dude, you matter.

2487
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:39,380
I have a friend who worked for Activision Blizzard.

2488
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:39,860
She was.

2489
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:43,060
She did like she worked like on the board.

2490
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:48,660
So she's told me some horror stories, you know, and we used to play Overwatch.

2491
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:52,580
No, I have I have not touched Overwatch since all of this happened.

2492
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:53,540
And I'm like, you know what?

2493
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:59,140
I have plenty of other games that I can play in the meantime.

2494
02:09:59,140 --> 02:09:59,640
Yep.

2495
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:06,980
I am perfectly content playing Powerwash Simulator over Diablo two until Bobby Kotick

2496
02:10:06,980 --> 02:10:07,480
is handled.

2497
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:11,540
I just picked up I just picked up Xenoblade Chronicles.

2498
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,940
I could start playing that and check it out and check that out.

2499
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:14,820
You know, that's a lot of fun.

2500
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:15,320
Yeah.

2501
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:15,820
Yeah.

2502
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:19,620
I just picked up Ghost of Tsushima directors cut from as well.

2503
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:21,700
I'm like, that's a I'll definitely you know.

2504
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,860
There's no shortage of games, people.

2505
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,780
There's no shortage of games, people.

2506
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:31,860
I mean, look, if I really want to if I really want to play something like Call of Duty,

2507
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,700
I'll go play Battlefield and Call of the Day.

2508
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:34,200
That's it.

2509
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:39,540
Bobby Blackwell was pointing out Paladins versus Overwatch.

2510
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:40,040
Why not?

2511
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:44,660
Mike Deft in chat says Pokemon Unite to fill the salt in my life.

2512
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:51,940
West Buster says as a side note, since news of California's investigation broke this summer,

2513
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:55,380
ATVI has lost 30 percent of its value.

2514
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:55,700
Yep.

2515
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:58,580
And also supports what you're saying is Xenoblade Chronicles is awesome.

2516
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:59,080
That's request.

2517
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:06,580
So I am not I'm not shedding a tear over this, you know, and the thing is,

2518
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:14,660
I also have friends that work Activision Blizzard, and those are where my tears are going because

2519
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:19,940
I know they are they are victims trying to make a paycheck in this horrible situation

2520
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,540
that and I feel bad because I'm sitting here going, well, I'm boycott.

2521
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:29,940
But it just hit a point where I'm like, nothing else is working and the situation isn't changing.

2522
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:37,460
It has to it has to like Activision has to be hurt financially for the exactly to do

2523
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:41,700
fucking anything besides forming a committee to investigate themselves.

2524
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:46,420
Which is so transparent, I'm so glad people are seeing right through it,

2525
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:49,940
especially in the financial channels and calling them on their bullshit.

2526
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:52,420
It's just anyway.

2527
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:55,140
Yes. And Bobby Blackwell says not only are they getting a paycheck,

2528
02:11:55,140 --> 02:11:57,940
those employees still really care about the worlds they are creating.

2529
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:00,340
Yes. And I cannot wait to experience them

2530
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:05,300
when Bobby Kotek is gone and that day is over due and counting.

2531
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:07,460
Exactly. Exactly.

2532
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:10,420
Rama, anything else on your mind tonight before we wrap it up?

2533
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:13,060
One quick thing and I'm gonna get out of here.

2534
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:15,620
You ever see development?

2535
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,700
Oh, it's many times.

2536
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,220
It's been a while, but yeah, of course.

2537
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:21,380
Multi pass.

2538
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:24,420
OK, for the high pass for the podcast listeners,

2539
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:26,980
he's holding up a multi pass on the camera there.

2540
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:32,260
So and it has a multi task and it has and it has my covid card in here.

2541
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:34,420
So I'm like a friend of mine was selling these.

2542
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:36,020
I'm like, I want one.

2543
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:37,540
I'm like, give me one.

2544
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:40,500
I keep this at my desk.

2545
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:44,260
So I know because this week I am getting the booster shot.

2546
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:45,540
So that's cute.

2547
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:49,220
I love that the multi passes the covid that I just have the thing because they built it

2548
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:53,140
into iPhone where you can just bring up the bar code and everything is just right there,

2549
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:54,420
which I like.

2550
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:56,580
So I don't bother with my card anymore.

2551
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:59,220
So I just think it's something to have.

2552
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,420
So, you know, it is it is.

2553
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:06,900
If assuming Dragon Con still mandates vaccine or prior test or whatever they do next year,

2554
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:09,540
I will take a multi pass and have it in there and do it that way.

2555
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:13,780
That's that's what my friend puts him up for sale.

2556
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:15,620
I will shoot all of y'all a message.

2557
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,140
OK, sounds good.

2558
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:17,460
All right.

2559
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:18,740
Take care, Rama.

2560
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:19,620
Thanks so much for the call.

2561
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:20,180
Appreciate you.

2562
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:20,660
All right.

2563
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:21,460
Take care, y'all.

2564
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:21,960
Bye.

2565
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:23,460
All right.

2566
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:24,340
Oh, we have another.

2567
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,780
We got another call.

2568
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,500
Let's do it.

2569
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,420
Let's just go right to another call.

2570
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:29,540
Hi.

2571
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:30,820
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2572
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:31,320
Who's this?

2573
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:38,580
This week, VX JasonXV calls into Orange Lounge Radio once again and extends his talking time

2574
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:39,080
total.

2575
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:42,500
We love hearing you talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2576
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:46,100
I remember when you were when we were in a situation, you had the ability to sit in on

2577
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:48,820
episodes and always loved having you here, Jason.

2578
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,980
And it's a pleasure to have you here tonight.

2579
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:51,700
What's on your mind?

2580
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:55,380
Oh, in the before times, as as they call it these days.

2581
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,100
Yeah, indeed.

2582
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:01,460
Have you have any of you watched Legends of the Hidden Temple?

2583
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,660
Not the new one.

2584
02:14:04,660 --> 02:14:07,220
Just the one back in the day movie.

2585
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:12,740
Also that which I only recently, I think, relearned about.

2586
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:17,140
But I was I was alluding to the game show series that started back up in the last what?

2587
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:18,900
Just last month, I think, or October.

2588
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:19,700
That was last month.

2589
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,580
It's not December yet.

2590
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:25,780
No, my my friend Victoria from Shaking and Crying, that show that we had here,

2591
02:14:27,380 --> 02:14:29,060
really wanted to audition for that with me.

2592
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:30,180
And I wanted to do it, too.

2593
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:32,900
But it's just there was no way I was going to be able to get down to L.A. and do that.

2594
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:33,700
I'll do all that stuff.

2595
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:35,940
But yeah, we would we would have been so good on that show.

2596
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:37,460
But is it adults now?

2597
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:39,140
It's yeah, it's adults.

2598
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:43,380
It was it's a little strange to me because the casting call that I saw

2599
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:47,700
said like eighteen to twenty ones, like like sub twenty fives.

2600
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:50,500
But there have definitely been older groups like there were

2601
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:54,100
last weeks or two episodes ago, two episodes ago.

2602
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:54,600
Definitely.

2603
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:57,140
I've watched the whole series so far.

2604
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:57,700
The whole season.

2605
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:02,740
Don't worry.

2606
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:06,660
There's a minute more in the temple and people are still fucking everything up.

2607
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:08,100
So it's not just kids that are stupid.

2608
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:13,300
It's a little it's a little weird because the casting call that I saw was early 20 somethings.

2609
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:17,060
Yet two episodes ago, I think it was the Silver Snakes, one of the teams,

2610
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:21,620
the teams that was at the Temple Run, both of them were in the original airing of the show.

2611
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:24,660
And it's been 22 years alone since the show.

2612
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:25,140
More than that.

2613
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:26,340
It's been like 25 years.

2614
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:26,840
Yeah.

2615
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:29,940
So I don't know if like I don't know.

2616
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:32,500
I don't know anything about how L.A. Hollywood TV shows work.

2617
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,660
I don't know if there were multiple casting calls.

2618
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:36,980
I don't know if it was just like apply anyways.

2619
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:38,580
And maybe the producer will accept you.

2620
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:40,420
I don't know how you are correct.

2621
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:42,100
They're putting their feelers out everywhere.

2622
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:43,220
They have casting calls here.

2623
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:44,660
They post on social media.

2624
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:47,700
They probably have recruiters that go out and try to find people.

2625
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:48,420
It's it's all of it.

2626
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:52,900
They probably they probably had contact information for past contestants.

2627
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:55,940
And they probably looked that way to try to find them.

2628
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:56,580
I bet they did.

2629
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:59,780
But yeah, no, I know that it's on the CW, right?

2630
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:04,740
And I'm assuming you can watch in their app or something like that or maybe one of those things.

2631
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:08,580
That's pretty cool that I keep I keep forgetting that it's back.

2632
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:11,300
I saw a commercial for it at random.

2633
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:12,980
But yeah, I just I keep forgetting it's back.

2634
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:13,620
But that's so cool.

2635
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:21,620
It's these these last many years, adult grown up, much more mature.

2636
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:23,700
Jason, relatively speaking, has come out.

2637
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:30,580
It's it's just been really, really weird to me because like I think about all the conflicts

2638
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:35,060
I used to have with people, just like social situation and conflicts and those sorts of things.

2639
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:41,140
And the rationales that I gave at the time, the times that I know I didn't have a rationale

2640
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:44,660
and I made shit up because I wasn't going to give up my core point.

2641
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:48,660
And then I kind of take a step back and think about that in conflicts in general of things

2642
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:54,420
of things that don't have like, you know, an obvious aggressor damage detriment,

2643
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:54,980
that sort of thing.

2644
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:56,260
But just just social strife.

2645
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:01,140
The thing that you hear about more often than not, then, you know, the worst of physical

2646
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:02,420
examples and everything else.

2647
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:07,940
And it's just kind of like, you know, you know, complaints between you and your parents

2648
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:12,580
about your parents believing this way and telling you why, but you feeling differently,

2649
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:14,980
but not having the life experience to really talk about yet.

2650
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:21,540
And it's just it's so many different and annoying things to think about that.

2651
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:28,500
Accept yourself for who you are, but you probably have to be this different way in this different

2652
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:29,140
situation.

2653
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:36,980
You know, lean into the I I've used the I have a face for radio joke against myself

2654
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:38,340
and I still kind of feel that way.

2655
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:41,460
You know, lean into it because that's who I am.

2656
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:43,860
But there's going to be limits to it.

2657
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:47,540
And radio, you know, audio only only goes so far these days.

2658
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:52,740
And this channel is one of the very few situations I can think of any other channel and anybody

2659
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:55,140
else, anybody else's production that does something like that.

2660
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:59,540
Independence Day had had its sequel.

2661
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:03,860
Jeez, it was either 2016 or 2018 or something like that.

2662
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:09,220
And I finally watched it a couple of weeks ago and I thought to myself, is this movie

2663
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:11,540
terrible or am I just an adult now?

2664
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:16,420
Because I loved the first one, but the second one was just goofy as hell.

2665
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:18,980
And I don't know.

2666
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:20,660
I don't know what to blame it on.

2667
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:21,060
I don't.

2668
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:24,180
I didn't look up if it's the same director, the same producer, the same writer.

2669
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:25,620
I'm pretty sure it is.

2670
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:26,660
Rob something.

2671
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:27,620
Rod or Rob something.

2672
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:30,980
Or if it's just there.

2673
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:32,660
Thank you.

2674
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:33,300
You nailed it.

2675
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:39,300
It's the I have this conversation with myself over and over and over about social situations.

2676
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:42,500
And it's there's there's never going to be a resolution.

2677
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:45,060
There's never going to be one single answer that applies in every case.

2678
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:50,820
And it's just a really difficult topic to I don't want to use the word agonize over,

2679
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:53,220
but the only term that's coming to mind is agonize over.

2680
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:59,380
Um, I don't know where to begin.

2681
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:02,900
Um, yeah, there's I thought about caveatting this.

2682
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:06,580
I'm going to rely on you and your ability to make sense of my rambling, not lunacy.

2683
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:09,140
It makes sense, but it's also kind of interesting.

2684
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,340
All of those little like lemons that life throws at you.

2685
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:15,700
We just had an extensive conversation about something I'm going through.

2686
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:18,020
There wasn't something I was facing when I was 21.

2687
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:22,180
And, you know, kind of like a lot of the changes that that's caused in my own life.

2688
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:25,380
And so, you know, sometimes there isn't.

2689
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:29,940
You know, those changes and those things, there's not a lot you can do about it.

2690
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:34,580
You know, whether it be genetic disposition or just the fact that bad things happened

2691
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:36,660
to people all the time.

2692
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:38,660
And it's just the way that it is.

2693
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,020
The only thing you kind of can control is how do you sort of respond?

2694
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:44,580
To those types of situations, right?

2695
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:47,220
Yeah, that that's all you really can do.

2696
02:19:48,100 --> 02:19:54,260
But I think it's nice that these sorts of comfort foods like classic video games,

2697
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:59,140
like a remasters of classic video games, even like, oh, no, did we lose Jason?

2698
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:01,220
No, we lost Jamie.

2699
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:01,620
That's weird.

2700
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:01,860
All right.

2701
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:02,580
She should be back.

2702
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:03,300
That's odd.

2703
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:05,140
Oh, this is a weird little hiccup.

2704
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:10,900
Um, uh, but we have like, you know, those types of comfort food types of things.

2705
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:15,860
The old game shows that come back again to sort of remind us of those better times,

2706
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:19,860
even if the situation now might be different.

2707
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:22,420
For example, if you think about it, because of what I'm dealing, you know,

2708
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:26,260
I love those types of reality shows, like The Survivor and Big Brother.

2709
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:27,780
And people have joked to me that.

2710
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:33,140
Sorry, I heard a very strange noise outside.

2711
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:33,780
Sorry, guys.

2712
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:35,940
So joys of doing things live in your house.

2713
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:39,220
Um, anyway, um, where was I?

2714
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:39,620
Oh, yes.

2715
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:43,140
Um, I love those types of shows like Survivor and Big Brother and so forth.

2716
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:45,140
Um, and people say, oh, you should go on Survivor.

2717
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:45,940
You should go on Survivor.

2718
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:51,460
The reality is kind of sitting in now that they would never touch me with my condition.

2719
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:52,760
Yeah.

2720
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:55,140
I'm never going to get put on that show now.

2721
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:58,340
Um, and that's just age.

2722
02:20:58,340 --> 02:20:58,980
I say that.

2723
02:20:58,980 --> 02:20:59,940
I say that not.

2724
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:04,100
I say that not to insult you, of course, but the nature that all of those are the young,

2725
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:04,660
hot.

2726
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:05,940
Well, that I know of.

2727
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:08,020
They have 40 and 50 somethings that go on that show.

2728
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:14,900
They usually try to diversify the age a little bit, but there are more of the good looking

2729
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:16,980
model types that are recruited from bars.

2730
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:18,340
Yes, absolutely.

2731
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:20,740
My chances would be lower, but not gone.

2732
02:21:20,740 --> 02:21:23,060
And now it's like that's never going to happen.

2733
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:28,420
But I have ways to play it online when I have the time.

2734
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:32,980
I have other ways to, you know, kind of participate and so forth.

2735
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:39,700
My point is, is that, you know, the situations will change and it's how you respond to them

2736
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:42,500
that truly is you and your character and so forth.

2737
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:49,860
And sometimes it's neat to revisit things from a different time because it not only

2738
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:54,100
necessarily reminds you about thing, but it reminds you of that simpler time when your

2739
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:56,740
problems didn't seem as bad as they are today.

2740
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:01,460
Or maybe the opposite in some cases, depending on what it is.

2741
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:02,600
Yeah.

2742
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:10,500
Yeah, that topic just spirals endlessly because it's also like finding your people to enjoy

2743
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:12,820
it with and having to deal with the people that don't.

2744
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:14,660
That's huge, yes.

2745
02:22:15,780 --> 02:22:18,100
No, finding your people is so important.

2746
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:18,740
It really is.

2747
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:19,460
Yeah.

2748
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:20,580
Thank God for the internet.

2749
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:26,980
You folks, I agree with you in opinion when we were talking about, when you were talking

2750
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:32,660
about the Mass Effect TV show, that a unique story is more preferable to, hey, let's take

2751
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:34,260
the game and put it on TV.

2752
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:38,820
The game was an experience and people, it is very, games by nature being interactive

2753
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:41,060
is very highly personal to oneself.

2754
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:48,340
And so to retell that story, yeah, is probably, you're not going to satisfy everyone, but

2755
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:54,660
picking one person's story is probably going to satisfy the fewest of them all in the grand

2756
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:55,380
scheme of things.

2757
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:59,940
I like remasters because I know the technology changes.

2758
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:01,460
I don't have a lot of older devices.

2759
02:23:01,460 --> 02:23:03,540
I like the ability to have it again.

2760
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:10,180
Rebuying it, that's a little difficult in the era of cloud gaming and I've always been

2761
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:11,300
an emulating person.

2762
02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:16,660
So with the official blessing of that and cloud gaming and everything else, opportunities

2763
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:19,860
for preservation and back catalog stuff is happening even more.

2764
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:27,380
Yeah, I think the summary of everything that I'm getting at is that everything is fucking

2765
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:28,260
difficult.

2766
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:29,620
Weave your way through it.

2767
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:33,700
Do what you enjoy at no detrimental expense to others.

2768
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:39,300
Don't be a Roblox harasser fucking ass hat for the subs.

2769
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:42,820
How about if people just not be twats?

2770
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:45,220
It would be lovely.

2771
02:23:45,860 --> 02:24:01,220
Yeah, do what you love and solicit the help of either your social circle, a guidance counselor,

2772
02:24:01,220 --> 02:24:07,700
mental health therapist, whatever the desired level is for seemingly irresolvable conflicts.

2773
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:12,580
There are the things out there for you to express yourself in the way that you want

2774
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:17,060
to do and there are the people to help you through it when it becomes difficult and you

2775
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:18,740
want to keep going down that road.

2776
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:22,020
There are people that can help you with that and you should absolutely avail yourself of

2777
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:26,180
them as difficult as that may be in and of itself as well.

2778
02:24:27,220 --> 02:24:28,740
I think we'll leave it on that note.

2779
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:29,540
Thank you, Jason.

2780
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:32,500
I really appreciate the call and the introspection tonight.

2781
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:39,860
That oh so happy thought in the post Thanksgiving still burn off and December ramp up and...

2782
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:45,540
It's it's necessary just because it's just because it's I don't know what the right word

2783
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:49,780
would be difficult to talk about doesn't mean it shouldn't be so.

2784
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:50,660
Oh, absolutely.

2785
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:51,620
A hundred percent.

2786
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:52,120
Absolutely.

2787
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:53,220
All right.

2788
02:24:53,220 --> 02:24:54,340
Take care of my friend.

2789
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:57,140
We'll we'll hear from you next week for sure, at least in the intro.

2790
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:59,780
But I hope we talk again on these calls again real soon.

2791
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:01,060
Absolutely.

2792
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:01,860
Hear me later.

2793
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,100
All right.

2794
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:02,660
Take care, buddy.

2795
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:04,020
All right.

2796
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:06,820
And you will hear Jason later in the outro of the show, that's for sure.

2797
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:10,980
OK, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight and we are about to wrap up.

2798
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:17,700
However, before we get there, I do I solicited tweets tonight and Jason brought up emulation

2799
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,980
and I was like, oh, yeah, we had a tweet.

2800
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:19,620
I want to get to it.

2801
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:23,300
So we had a tweet tonight from at Garth the Wolf.

2802
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:26,340
And if you want to follow us on OLR at OLR is the place to do it.

2803
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:33,860
Who tweeted us a potential topic for tonight, saying Nintendo's N64 emulation for their

2804
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:37,060
online service is shoddy at best.

2805
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:41,700
Ocarina of Time is plagued with lag issues and degraded visuals with similar issues in

2806
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:44,820
Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64.

2807
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,460
Thoughts?

2808
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:47,140
You think Nintendo will patch this?

2809
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:52,420
Um, no, I think they're under pressure to I I'm a little less cynical.

2810
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:55,540
I think they will eventually, especially if they want people to renew that thing in a

2811
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:56,100
year.

2812
02:25:56,100 --> 02:26:01,140
Um, but boy, boy, did a lot of people learn a lesson about paying for something for a

2813
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:03,300
year on name alone.

2814
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:06,100
And boy, was that a tough lesson to learn?

2815
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:07,300
I didn't get it.

2816
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:08,740
And I certainly have.

2817
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:13,060
But when I see tweets like that and feedback about how the emulation really in that I'm

2818
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:14,820
certainly not motivated to get it now.

2819
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:22,900
So I just I don't know how many cynical people like me are truly out there and how many people

2820
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:26,900
bought it on name alone and the promise of all this other stuff, or maybe the Animal

2821
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:31,140
Crossing DLC, if you look at it, really did kind of enhance the value if that was something

2822
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:32,100
you were into.

2823
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:33,460
So there's a variety of reasons.

2824
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:40,100
But yeah, I think Nintendo will be pressured to patch it, but they're certainly in no hurry.

2825
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:43,620
In my opinion, they've got a year to do it because they got a bunch of people already

2826
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:44,820
pony up a year.

2827
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:47,060
So don't expect it tomorrow.

2828
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:48,500
But if it does drop tomorrow, great.

2829
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:52,260
All right.

2830
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:54,260
Thank you for the tweets at O L R.

2831
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:55,860
I'll try to incorporate more.

2832
02:26:55,860 --> 02:26:58,900
So I know you guys tag us and I don't always read them on the show because I forget on

2833
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:01,540
Sunday night, but I'll try to remind myself to check that more often if you guys want

2834
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:04,740
to send us some lovely tweets at O L R for now, though.

2835
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:05,940
Hey, we're two and a half hours in.

2836
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:08,500
I thought this would be a shorter show tonight, and it's kind of a normal length show.

2837
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:13,460
We just had a lot of good, good, good things to chew on here at the table after Thanksgiving.

2838
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:18,500
So I appreciate you guys being here and going through the show with us all.

2839
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:22,340
I do want to check real quick and ask for any last minute stories from my co-host.

2840
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:25,220
I'm not expecting any this week, but not for me.

2841
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:31,300
OK, there's the I guess project that's called Destination Home.

2842
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:36,740
They've been working on this project for years now to reattempt to bring PlayStation Home

2843
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:42,900
back, and apparently they're still making some more progress on that.

2844
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:48,660
They have released a teaser trailer showing some of the stuff that I mean, they've kind

2845
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,660
of brought back some of the spaces and everything.

2846
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:56,260
So if Sony shuts it down, it'll tell you something.

2847
02:27:57,140 --> 02:28:01,140
I'm surprised they haven't tried to like spin it off to make like, you know, their

2848
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:07,060
own thing instead of bringing PlayStation Home back, just like make a new thing that's

2849
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:11,380
not PlayStation Home, like VR chat and release it on PlayStation, the ultimate gag.

2850
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:15,300
Yeah, it's like, all right.

2851
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,060
Are they gagging?

2852
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:22,100
That's going to bring our show to a close for tonight.

2853
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,900
Thank you guys for listening to our show.

2854
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:28,660
Whether you were here live or you downloaded us on the podcast feed through your favorite

2855
02:28:28,660 --> 02:28:31,380
player like iTunes, Spotify, whatever it was.

2856
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:33,780
Thank you so much for being a part of the show this week.

2857
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:34,900
Appreciate y'all.

2858
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:37,860
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

2859
02:28:37,860 --> 02:28:38,980
Help us spread the word.

2860
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:43,300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to add to the

2861
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:44,100
conversation.

2862
02:28:44,100 --> 02:28:49,780
So a nice five star review on one of those sites, a social media post hosting here at

2863
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:50,180
Twitch.

2864
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:53,380
I mean, you kind of have to do it live on Sunday night, but hey, we'll take anything

2865
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:55,220
we can get that helps spread the word.

2866
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:56,900
I really, really appreciate that.

2867
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:59,380
The Vaga Network shop is currently down for maintenance.

2868
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:02,500
We didn't do a lot of work on it this week because of Thanksgiving.

2869
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:06,180
We'll be honest, but hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we'll have some more progress

2870
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:09,860
on that front for you guys, especially if anybody's wanting holiday merch.

2871
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,860
We'll try to get that up pretty soon for you guys.

2872
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:14,740
Otherwise, that's all I've got.

2873
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:16,580
Thank you guys again for being here tonight.

2874
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:19,140
We will be back next week to do it all again.

2875
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:20,820
It's time to get the final thoughts.

2876
02:29:20,820 --> 02:29:25,860
I will start with Dark Sakura because I know she's going to set up for her post stream

2877
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:27,220
over at her channel.

2878
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:33,780
I have a new intro video that I managed to finish right at the start of Orange House

2879
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:39,940
Radio and some temporary AFK and thank you things.

2880
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:44,500
I've been really working, trying to get a little bit more skill in Final Cut Pro.

2881
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,900
And I think I've done something pretty nice.

2882
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:51,540
Maybe I have to master the music a little bit better in logic, but I think doing okay.

2883
02:29:52,100 --> 02:30:01,060
But this is the second week now of weaning off my meds and I am not a pleasant person

2884
02:30:01,060 --> 02:30:03,140
to be around at a busy IKEA.

2885
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:03,940
We'll leave it at that.

2886
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:05,940
All right.

2887
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:09,700
Well, have a good night, Dark Sakura, and bully some survivors for us.

2888
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:11,300
Later taters.

2889
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:11,800
All right.

2890
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:15,780
We will go now to Loki with his final thought.

2891
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,140
Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?

2892
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:22,980
My final thought is I need to get my new video out and then I got to figure out what to do

2893
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:27,380
between now and whenever the new series starts, because I don't know.

2894
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:31,940
I'm trying to get them to nail down timing for that, but it's going to be like an awkward

2895
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:33,140
couple of weeks or so.

2896
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:36,420
It's all up to figure something out until then.

2897
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:37,380
All right.

2898
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,820
And my final thought, I will be back streaming tomorrow.

2899
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:44,420
I haven't streamed in a couple of weeks, but I will get back into the post work.

2900
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:48,180
Obviously, y'all know things have been going on, but I'm going to get back into the post

2901
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,940
work habit of streaming.

2902
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:54,820
So I'll see you guys around 4.15-4.30 Pacific tomorrow at my channel, Rob Roberts.

2903
02:30:54,820 --> 02:30:58,100
I'm going to be playing some No Man's Sky, continuing on the first expedition.

2904
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:02,500
And I'm already about halfway through it, so I'll kind of pick it up and answer any

2905
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:06,180
questions for those of you guys that are starting it the best I can and so forth.

2906
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:07,780
So I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2907
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,820
Also, I want to say thanks again for those downloading the show, listening to the show,

2908
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:14,100
supporting the show.

2909
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:14,980
It means a lot.

2910
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:18,580
And thanks to the emails and the kind words and the love.

2911
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:22,500
I could go on and on, but here we come, year 20.

2912
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:25,300
We're only about a month away in episode 900, if you can believe it.

2913
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:27,460
Only a few weeks away.

2914
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,540
Have a great week, everybody.

2915
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:31,540
Happy Hanukkah to those that celebrate.

2916
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:33,140
Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.

2917
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:35,860
Here comes December, believe it or not.

2918
02:31:36,580 --> 02:31:39,940
Get vaccinated so that this Omnicron thing doesn't become an issue.

2919
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:40,420
Good Lord.

2920
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:40,660
All right.

2921
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:41,540
Have a good night, everybody.

2922
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:41,780
Bye.

2923
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:13,780
See you next week.

2924
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:42,260
Bye.
