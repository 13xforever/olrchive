0	12400	I don't know if it's a sign at a time, it's a sign of my being less in the music
12400	15760	games community, if it's because we've had simulators with no cost for decades, but
15760	19560	Konami's PC gaming network has become a little bigger with the release of Dance Dance Revolution
19560	23600	Grand Prix and I haven't seen a lot of hype yet. The song list is incredible and as I've
23600	28200	loved about modern Bimani, updates will doubtlessly continue to come. This is the music game update,
28200	31600	possibly the last of the year, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers,
31600	34440	and Loki to bring you more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting
34440	36440	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36440	47440	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
47440	54440	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live with you once again
54440	63720	for episode number 891 of our show for this November the 14th of 2021. My name is Rob
63720	69280	Roberts and joining me as always, say hello first off to DarkSakura, but you can call
69280	70280	her Jamie Sommers. Hi.
70280	71280	Hi.
71280	72280	How are you?
72280	76320	I'm all right. How are you?
76320	80920	I've had a few weeks. I've had a bit of a month. Maybe I'll talk about some of that
80920	86600	later, but yeah, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's been a time. Um, big things happening. Yeah.
86600	91920	Yeah. Lots going on. Um, lots going on in video games too. Um, I know a little later
91920	96080	in the show, we're going to talk about some of the issues that have come up as a problem
96080	101080	with the dead by daylight, um, test realm, but funny enough, the part that we're probably
101080	105520	not going to talk about as much. So I'll talk about it now is the actual new killer and
105520	110840	survivor that were announced for the game, the artist. And I'm curious about your thoughts.
110840	117960	We have guy ferry. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Uh, no, actually FBI agent, whatever. I mean, I'm
117960	124960	glad we have another, uh, Latino character. Yes. And actually we have two new Latin characters.
124960	130040	So I'm Carmina, the artist, first of all, I love her. I love her story and I love her
130040	136580	level. Yeah. It was like three different surrealist paintings like in one, like you can see bits
136580	141940	of a Dali in the, you know, the Sandy landscape and the shape of the trees and her little
141940	148020	cathedral inside is almost perfectly based off of an Escher painting. And this week is
148020	153280	the week that the Hawkins laboratory map is going away in dead by daylight because the
153280	158620	stranger things license will be lost for the marketplace in the game. Uh, this week the
158620	163700	offerings are already gone, right? Yeah. The offerings are gone. And, um, but, but, uh,
163700	170460	of course, uh, to, to clarify, if you've already purchased Nancy Steve or the killer, the Demigorgon,
170460	174940	you will get to keep that. It's just, you can no longer buy them. Yeah. You can no longer
174940	179980	buy them after a Friday. I think it's the big day that that is all being pulled. So
179980	185220	anyway, we also know though that there's also Jonathan who's only available as a cosmetic,
185220	190740	right? Um, so we're losing Hawkins laboratory as a level, but this, you know, which is,
190740	194620	you know, in a way it's kind of like, I know people have very strong feelings about indoor
194620	198780	maps. And I think, but I think Hawkins is superior to Leary's in my opinion, the other
198780	206020	doctor, whatever. Um, but, uh, uh, like I said, everybody has their opinion, but I think
206020	210980	this new map, which is an indoor, it's outdoor, mostly outdoor, it has a few indoor parts.
210980	214540	It's mostly outdoor. I think his new map is like, Oh, this is so damn good. It makes up
214540	219620	for losing Hawkins. They need to finish, fix the lighting issues on the indoor though.
219620	225740	Because it's almost unplayable without improving your brightness or having some sort of filter.
225740	229260	It's very dark. Yeah. And it's on the test build for now. So, you know, there's lots
229260	233260	of changes to come, but, um, that's just the point of the test build is to get feedback
233260	236740	from the people playing it. And I was just, I was just curious, your early thoughts, of
236740	241540	course, the killer and survivor won't release for probably another two, three weeks, but,
241540	248820	um, it's nice useless. He's loud. He's large. And I'm not saying this in terms of, Oh yeah,
248820	252780	he's a big guy. Cause I mean, I think it's good that we have more representation, but
252780	260580	from a tactical standpoint, he's a large guy, which makes him an easier target. He is very
260580	269140	loud. And honestly, I don't think his perks are all that great. However, Carmina is perfect
269140	281900	all around her. Her bird attack puts the chains, the axes, and the, the traps all to shame.
281900	288820	I think as far as the survivor goes, his perk that extends the run by two seconds. Um, when
288820	294540	you get hit, I think that is a lot more, that's basically a sprint burst at the time you need
294540	298980	sprint burst. And so I think that's kinda, um, I think that'll be the perk people want,
298980	304020	but we'll see. A good killer is going to be able to compensate for it easy. Most killers
304020	308300	are going to be able to catch up on that extra two seconds anyway. I don't always go up against
308300	313580	good killers. All right. Anyway, uh, let's say hello to someone who doesn't play quite
313580	318540	as much dead by daylight, but it plays a lot of other stuff. Certainly Minecraft and, and
318540	322980	a game we're going to talk about tonight. Uh, hey, hi tech master Loki. I don't play
322980	327380	any dead by daylight. No. Oh, you don't play any dead by day. Well, no, I know you have
327380	331820	to buy the game in order to play it. Yes. Um, that's okay. I know there's people listen
331820	336900	to this show. It's all right. Do they have it on games pass? I mean, yes, that's how
336900	343900	I started it. Uh, dead by daylight is on a game pass for PC or windows store and a X
343900	347500	box. That's how I started playing. That's how I got into it is I was like, Oh, well,
347500	351780	Alan's used to really like this game. It's free on game pass. What do I have to lose?
351780	357180	And well, apparently hours and hours and hours of my time, uh, is what I have to lose, but
357180	367060	Hey, here we go. Isn't that the way with video games? It is. Yeah, definitely. So what's
367060	371740	the game you have playing behind you tonight? I feel like I've seen it before. Yeah, you
371740	378780	have seen it before. And, and it's, it's shoddy glory. We have, uh, the grant has auto definitive
378780	383300	edition. I think this is just grant the thought of three right now, but it is a long play
383300	388620	video. It might be all three. I don't know. Yeah. Um, I'm going to ask dark soccer to
388620	394180	kick us off tonight in our discussion about everything that's going on with all of this.
394180	399860	First I do want to say hello to our chatters. Um, hi folks over at twitch.tv slash VOG network
400620	404820	where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right
404820	409280	after the Bobby black Wolf show. Hello. Hello. Hello to all of you. I've seen some new people
409280	414100	in chat tonight. So hello to the new folks, whether you're a long time podcaster, first
414100	418780	time Twitch viewer or whatever you've been lurking. Hello. Hello. All the same and welcome
418780	425260	to our happy. Oh, that could be it too. Hello from Minecraft. Hello from dead by daylight
425300	430020	and my streams star Sakura streams. Who knows where people come from, but welcome. Welcome.
430020	434300	Uh, I want to say thank you. Thank you because I see a level five hype train going on and
434300	438620	it takes, it takes a lot of biddies and subs to get to a level five hype train. So I would
438620	443980	just want to do acknowledge that and say thank you. I will, I, I, we are taping a podcast.
443980	447260	I haven't kind of given this disclaimer in a little while. So just a reminder, we are
447260	452420	taping a podcast here and um, I know usually on Twitch, if you're like playing a game or
452420	456780	something, you usually kind of stop what you're doing and you stop and go, Hey, thanks
456780	460540	pod culture for the gift subs, you know, and stuff like that. And, and we really, we do
460540	464660	have when we're live, we do have a ticker bar at the bottom that kind of shows that
464660	468260	information that's going on. But since we are taping a podcast, we don't like to interrupt
468260	472380	every 15 seconds with what we're talking about and say that. So we will say it all at the
472380	477340	very, very, very end. And please know we appreciate it all the same. And I just do want to say
477340	483860	thank you, uh, for LA hype train going on right now. Okay. So let's talk about the train
483860	490740	that derailed this week and that is the grand theft auto remasters. And, um, yeah, Loki,
490740	496060	Loki, Loki said so, well, you didn't say that it was going to be a disaster, but you kind
496060	501300	of said like, this is not going to be good. They would put the minimal amount of effort
501300	506300	in. Yeah. And yes, yes. And so, yes, yes, I would agree with that. That is some, that
506300	510700	is the sentiment you've said they would put the minimal amount of effort in and, uh, that
510700	516380	is showing in all sorts of ways, dark Sakura, you have one very interesting way that effort
516380	521460	question Mark is showing up, right? Yeah. Um, I just thought like the moment I read
521460	524740	it, I actually laughed my ass off. And then I thought about it. I was like, actually,
524740	533500	that's probably not too much fun. Um, apparently the rain is so hard in GTA trilogy that it
533500	543580	it's unplayable. Um, someone put out a graphic comparison, uh, between the two and, you know,
543580	549860	it looks like the remaster was looking pretty good and everything, but when the effects
549860	556980	came out though, the effects were really negatively impacted. Um, the dynamic weather, you know,
556980	560460	which, which is really cool for immersion, get you into the game, make it seem like a
560460	566300	real world, but in the new version of San Andreas, the rainstorms are absolutely terrible.
566300	574140	Um, like people are describing it as it makes my eyes hurt or I'm running in a flash flood.
574140	582060	You know, um, it, it turns basically city rain into, you know, Alabama. It's a heavy
582060	588380	rain. Yes, it's a heavy rain. You'll just want to run around screaming, Jason, Jason,
588940	594220	look at it story wise. Well, this is supposed to be like somewhere in California, right?
594780	601100	California doesn't get rain like that. Not often. I mean, I was looking at the video
602540	605900	and this is, this is Alabama rain. This is the rain I grew up with.
606620	611340	People here would just go inside and never leave the house if it rained like that here.
612220	618060	So to be fair, that storm that happened up here, the, the, the day I was at Disneyland,
618060	622540	thank you very much, where it was a nice sunny day. Apparently that storm was kind of like that.
622540	628220	I missed it all. So thanks. I didn't want to be here. Even bad storms here. Don't get Alabama bad.
630540	636140	Um, over in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, our voiceover guy VX Jason,
636380	644860	V says what? Get it. Uh, let's see. Dr. Chui in chat says I saw some of it via one of the
644860	649660	YouTube folks I follow. Yeah. The rain was one of the things covered among a long list of others.
649660	653580	Oh yes. We'll get into some more. I want to, I want to save a nice slice of this pie for Loki
653580	659020	here. Uh, and let's see Questbuster in chat says it sounds like it met their benchmark for being
659580	665660	minimally viable. I don't know from my, from my perspective. Yeah, sure. It probably met
665660	671260	the conditions for minimum minimally viable, but, um, that doesn't also make a good product,
671260	677820	but I also think it was, it met their conditions for having the computer do all the work for you
677820	684220	for better or for worse. Like I, I feel like the Loki, you tell me if I'm right or wrong.
684220	691020	I feel like grand theft auto remaster is what happens when you let that little kid from the
691020	695900	old G four commercials that goes, I'm going to go to programming school and learn how to just
695900	700700	turn up the graphics on level three with the little computer dial. Right. The grand theft
700700	704460	auto remaster, it's even worse than that. Cause like, let's not like insult indie developers.
704460	709660	I mean, Jesus, like I think that they would put more care into it. But no, no, no, no. The,
709660	714780	the grand theft auto remaster is what happens when you turn the graphics up on level three
714780	719420	using a dial. They turn the grand theft. They turn the graphics up using a lot of computer
719420	724140	automation, if I'm not mistaken here and a lot of stuff using this dial and this is what you get.
725340	734220	Yeah. So they did several things that were not great. Um, a lot of it, I think using AI to
734220	739500	upscale different things. I know one of the things that was pointed out in a video that I saw,
739500	744220	because I haven't purchased this game. I'm not playing on purchasing it anytime soon. Um,
744940	749820	show the record. You love grand theft auto. I do love grant and people don't, people,
749820	753340	not everybody may know this cause we have listeners that have listened for two episodes.
753340	759820	We have listeners that have listened for 890 episodes. Um, you love grand theft auto,
759820	763900	like to the point when grand theft auto four, I used to love grand theft auto to the point.
763900	768780	Yeah. Fair, fair. When grand theft auto four was all the rage on Xbox 360, you were in the top
768780	776140	100 players in the world. And there were millions of people to play on that.
776140	780780	And it doesn't, and that's, that's the thing that's scary is because they're the, well,
780780	786860	we'll get to it, but like the rumor is that's the next one to get remastered. Like, uh, don't
786860	794860	do that. Um, but yeah, so they did a lot of automation to try and using AI to improve the
794860	799820	graphics in the game, which sometimes works. We've seen that with like fan mods and stuff like that,
799820	803820	where they'll take like final fantasy seven or something like that and upscale all the background
803820	808860	images and stuff like that. Uh, well, they use this to also upscale like text in the game,
808860	815500	like in the actual background and stuff. And it did its best, but it also misspelled things
815500	822140	because some text was illegible for the AI to be able to translate it correctly and upscale it.
822140	826540	So you have things like, you know, there's an auto shop thing and it's talking about like
827660	831740	gear maintenance or something like that. And it says bear maintenance instead. It's just like
831740	837740	weird stuff. Um, then you have like the weird character models, which I have no idea what's
837740	844380	wrong with that, but they're, there's something that's for sure. Um, they increase the draw
844380	848940	distance, which is good, but they also removed all the fog, which makes the game look really weird.
848940	853580	And it's not that they can't do the fog because you can actually put the cheat code to make
853580	860300	foggy. And it looks fine when you do it like that. Um, but anyway, so let's, let's start off
860300	866060	with kind of the stuff that, uh, has been going on. So the PC version of the game has the rockstar
866060	871340	games launcher app, which I really hate that they have that, but for the rockstar social club,
871900	876780	they have their own launcher app, and this is how you're able to play grand theft auto.
877580	883660	So if you purchased it on PC, um, you may have noticed that the launcher app went offline. It
883660	889820	just stopped working for a little bit. Finally, they were able to bring it back online. However,
890380	894620	you can't play grand theft auto anymore. That game you just purchased, you can't play
895580	902780	the whole definitive edition. Um, it has been taken offline because the route removing some
902780	908540	unintended data files that were included in the game. What are those data files? You may ask?
908540	917980	Well, it is basically a master cut of the, well, basically the full grand theft auto,
917980	923580	San Andreas. So you may remember a while back that there was the whole hot coffee mod thing,
923580	928540	and there's additional scripts that were unused, but they were still included in the game. Well,
929340	934300	this has that, uh, those same scripts, they have removed some of the models and stuff from the
934300	941260	game, but they also included, um, dev comments, cut content, um, a whole bunch of stuff. That's
941260	947980	just weird that it's even in there, but being the fact that they got in trouble with the hot coffee
947980	952460	thing, even though it wasn't something you can play in the game, um, being that that code was
952460	959260	there, they got, you know, that game had an AO rating and apparently also all of the audio,
959260	964860	um, the music tracks that got cut in this version of the game as well are still on within there,
964860	971980	but they're disabled by scripts. So how hard would it be for someone to modify that? Who knows,
971980	977260	but there's, yeah, definitely a lot of issues. I think on the modder question, we're about to find
977260	981980	out, um, quest buster kind of going back to the rain thing, uh, brings up in our chat at twitch
981980	986620	TV slash vog network quest buster says after modders were chased away by rockstar in the
986620	991260	proceeding months, I've read that modders have already started working on fixing the rain.
991820	999660	This is hilarious to me that modders who take to have really gone out of their way to piss off
1000380	1006380	are now going to be the ones that are going to start fixing the game that blows my mind.
1007020	1013500	Just this week, they already had more DMCA strikes against modders. So for example,
1013500	1019020	they had three mods that were kind of taken down because of this, one of those being GTA advanced
1019020	1025260	PC port. Um, so what that is, is basically converting, uh, GTA advance, which was only
1025260	1033820	on the game boy advance into the, um, the GTA three engine. And then also they had the lost
1033820	1040460	and damned unlocked, which was basically the DLC for granted out for, but there's stuff that was
1040460	1046540	cut from that. And so it's kind of restoring that. And then oddly enough, um, a grand theft out of
1046540	1054140	four episodes of Liberty city, lost them, damn 65% complete save file, which isn't even a mod.
1054140	1061420	It's just a save file so that you can start with the game 65% complete. I don't get that one. Um,
1062300	1067340	I don't even understand how they can take this stuff down. Like it's just, it's, it's ridiculous,
1067340	1071580	just what they're doing here. But obviously it, it signals to me that they're looking to
1072460	1080540	do more of these remasters. Um, I'm, you know, maybe they shouldn't or well, maybe
1080540	1085180	whoever, whatever team was doing it so that this wasn't done by them necessarily in house. It was
1085180	1090780	done by some Grove street studios or something like that, which Grove street does a reference
1091180	1099500	to San Andreas. Um, I don't know if it's like a spinoff internal studio type thing, but basically,
1100060	1104620	you know, this is a team that was handling it and it's just, it's such a mess. Like,
1104620	1109180	I'm sure there were a lot of people working very hard on this who didn't have enough time
1109180	1112300	that I it's gotta be with this. It's always what it comes down to.
1113180	1118060	Somebody at the top wanted to get this out a lot faster than what was, what real was realistically
1118060	1123020	possible because they don't, they don't know what all really goes into it.
1123020	1127580	And like some of the character models though, that they did in the game, like they just look
1127580	1132940	terrible. Like the originals look better than this. Like, I just don't understand what choice
1132940	1138540	I understand, you know, maybe not making them look realistic. Fine. But like just the direction
1138540	1144460	that they went with is so weird. I just don't get it. Well, I think there's, uh, they were expecting
1144460	1150140	this to be a huge holiday title for them. And I think this backlash is gonna, you know, let's,
1150140	1156300	let's re this. Here we go. Here's our cyberpunk 2077 for the year. Here it is. There's always
1156300	1159820	some game around the holiday season that shouldn't have come out for the holidays.
1159820	1164540	Not even just this game. There's a lot of games out right now that just came out recently that
1164540	1170460	are a giant mess. And it's just consistent that we see this all the time. We have studios just
1170460	1174220	rushing games out and then apologizing later about the state that they're out in.
1175580	1182060	It would be less like, I'd be less angry about it if it were, if they weren't like coming down
1182060	1186780	on modders to like, you know, they're trying to just improve the game and like, well, they don't
1186780	1192540	have to, no, I understand they don't, but I get it. But like, but at the same time, some of these
1192540	1197900	projects that they're doing aren't necessarily hurting anything, I think, but they feel
1197900	1201900	differently, obviously with their games, I'm kind of locking that stuff down.
1201900	1206780	I think the modders shouldn't help them, but you know what? It's not my time. It's not my effort.
1206780	1212140	It's not my choice, but it's, you know, and I'm, I'm not, certainly a lot of these folks are
1212140	1215900	extremely talented what they're doing with the mods, especially, you know, so quickly on the
1215900	1220460	game. So I'm, I'm certainly not going to talk down or bad about them, but I just, I certainly
1220460	1224460	wouldn't be making the same choice. I'd be playing something else and modding something else right
1224460	1230460	now. But, um, I get it, I guess, you know, when you love something that much, you want to see it
1230460	1235260	succeed and you'll do anything to try to nudge it in the right direction, even when it maybe doesn't
1235260	1243500	deserve it. Yeah. Um, let's see, um, Bobby Black Wolf with a fair point on that whole thing saying
1243500	1249420	modders are helping out of spite so they can give a big middle finger to rockstar. I understand what
1249420	1254300	it's like to be motivated by spite. So I'll give you that fair. That might, that may be the whole
1254300	1261260	thing. Um, SSG100 Matt with a funny, uh, OLR history tidbit. Hot coffee controversy was first
1261260	1267740	mentioned for the first time on the show on episode 197. That was July 11th, 2005 per the Wiki.
1268860	1273660	Thank you for that little update. So yes, what's old is new again. There we are.
1274380	1281260	Huh? I was just looking that up. I guess it's just a coincidence about the, the name of that.
1281260	1285660	But aside from, you know, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy, so they've, they've done, um,
1286380	1292700	the bully scholarship edition, which was done not that long ago. And then arc survival evolved on,
1292700	1299020	no, nevermind this, I think not the judge, but I think this kind of explains it. So they've
1299020	1305020	been working on mobile ports of these games. So arc survival evolved on iOS and Android and bully
1305020	1312860	anniversary edition on iOS and Android, uh, Chinatown wars, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.
1313420	1321500	So they actually did the ports for San Andreas on, um, on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 as
1321500	1328300	well. Hmm. But yeah, they've been mainly working on, uh, iOS and Android ports of
1328300	1334140	the Grand Theft Auto, actually any of the rockstar game stuff. Interesting. Very.
1335740	1340300	So what happens now? Uh, Loki, what do you think? Where do we go from here? Like,
1340300	1345180	does take two just have to write off that? Well, those millions of copies we expected to sell are
1345180	1351180	going to get reduced because the internet figured out we cut too many corners with this. Um,
1351180	1358860	maybe they'll come back and fix the issues. I don't know if people even care at that point.
1358860	1362780	Somebody brought up great. We were talking about that. Well, hold on. Cause we were talking about
1362780	1366860	this on Twitter and somebody had jumped in and replied, I think you were tagged in this too,
1366860	1373980	and said, whatever happened with cyberpunk 2077 anyway? Like, and, and in a way, good question.
1374620	1378620	What did ever happen with that? No one talks about it anymore. It's still be,
1378780	1383900	well, the people talk about still, but it's just still in progress. Like they've already pushed
1383900	1389100	back once again, the PlayStation five and X-Box series X versions of the game. Um,
1390540	1396060	I don't know. I don't think any DLC has been worked on any, you know, recently they're still
1396060	1401020	putting out patches. I haven't played the game in over a year. Um, well not over a year because I
1401020	1405660	don't think it was out then, but about a year. I mean, shortly after it came out, I stopped playing
1405660	1412700	it and just kind of waiting for all the patches to be done. But yeah, I mean, I, I would love to
1412700	1420300	see the, I would love to see a remaster of four. Just not like this. Just please don't break it.
1420300	1424860	I would love to see four come back with death match. Oh God. I would love to have the death
1424860	1431340	match back like it was before, but they won't do it. She Hulk 10 in our chat brings up a good point
1431340	1436700	that, uh, refunds refunds. Uh, that's another thing that take to us deal with all this,
1436700	1441180	just like, you know, what happened with CD project red now, maybe not on that same scale
1441180	1445820	with CD project red. Cause that got really ugly. Well, and this, this story may not be done.
1446380	1451580	We'll see. Um, it took a few weeks for the, the cyberpunk, uh, issues to get there. But, um,
1451580	1457100	with the refund thing, you know, uh, we see people taking advantage of that, uh, already on, uh,
1457100	1464460	you know, on this game. So that's going to be interesting. All right. Uh, and, and lastly,
1464460	1469180	we'll close with this question here. Um, SSJ 100, Matt says, so how much did Loki laugh
1469180	1475340	maniacally when he saw this? I didn't, it was more like kind of figured this was going to be
1475340	1481820	the case. It's just, I don't know. I kind of like, I'm, I'm surprised just that the,
1481820	1487580	how bad it is like, cause some of the like remaster stuff that they've done, wasn't too
1487580	1492860	bad. Like I want to say like the X, and this same company worked on it, like the X-Box three 60
1492860	1502060	version of Sandra's wasn't super bad. Um, I'm just, I'm really surprised at like, like even
1502060	1507180	like, let's just say, let's just take it back. Like the absolute bare minimum, like we just up
1507180	1513420	scaled the graphics in the game. Maybe not even necessarily the models. Oh, so here's,
1513420	1518460	here's one that was also like, like, how could they get this so wrong? So I was watching, uh,
1518460	1525020	a video showing gameplay of this, um, being done by Matt, or was it Matt McMuscles? Uh,
1525020	1529820	he does a bunch of like, uh, funny like critique videos and stuff like that. And so he's showing
1529820	1536220	gameplay of Grand Theft Auto three and all of the audio in the game is like slowed down. Like,
1536220	1541900	it's really weird. And he's re he like, he's like, I rebooted my system. I restarted the
1541900	1548860	game. It's still doing this. And he was playing on, I don't remember, maybe in the switch. Um,
1549900	1553100	but there, no, it wasn't a sweet, it was one of the console versus PlayStation
1553100	1559260	five, maybe, or our X-Box series X. And yeah, it was just the audio is just like all distorted
1559260	1565660	and just like really deep, like everybody. It was weird. Um, but like, that's what I'm talking about.
1565660	1570620	Like that's the bare minimum and you gotta, you're right. Just pour it over the audio as it was
1570620	1575260	before. Like, why is the playback speed wrong? Like that's something that you should have caught
1575260	1579500	in testing. That's not something like, well, we'll fix it later. You know, that that's bad.
1580060	1583820	I think to go back to the original comment too, about laughing maniacally, it's, it's one of those
1583820	1588620	things where it's like, I don't know if we take pleasure in this news. I don't take pleasure in
1588620	1593260	it. Yeah. It's but it's really frustrating. Like kind of like Loki kind of, as we started off
1593260	1598540	talking about when you kind of saw it coming and like when we see this happen too much in this
1598540	1604620	industry where these projects are not given the time that they need or the manpower or the
1604620	1609020	resources or the investment that they need in order to be successful. And it's a bummer.
1609660	1614140	Yeah. It's just, it's a matter of looking at, I mean, let's not say that Rockstar Games doesn't
1614140	1619900	put any effort into Grand Theft Auto. They put in a lot of effort into, I don't have a lot of effort,
1619900	1624060	but they put in some effort into Grand Theft Auto Online because that's where they're making their
1624060	1629740	money. That's why I figured like when we're talking about a new version coming out, a remaster
1629740	1636940	or whatever, I wasn't expecting like a ton of changes. It was just kind of, you know, the bare
1636940	1640380	minimum. That said though, I mean, when we're talking about companies, they're putting the
1640380	1646380	bare minimum and re-release their games a billion times. At least, you know, the new Skyrim game
1646380	1651340	looks, you know, pretty good. I mean, considering that they didn't really do too much to it,
1651340	1655420	they just kind of slightly improved the graphics a bit and added a bunch of paid mods in there.
1656540	1662620	It still probably plays better. It's probably a better, you know, purchase versus what we got here
1662620	1670940	with Grand Theft Auto. A game that they're charging $60 for, by the way, for that.
1670940	1678380	Well, not if you're upgrading from a prior version. I get your point. I get it. All right.
1679420	1684140	Let's move on though. Let's talk about, we got other gaming news to get into and we will,
1684140	1687820	but it's always good to check in and see what types of games we have been playing this week
1687820	1693260	in a segment we call How Is Your Gaming Week? So let's go back to Dark Sakura. And I'm guessing
1693260	1696780	she probably hasn't played a lot of Grand Theft Auto, but we'll see what she has been playing
1696860	1701260	in your gaming week. I haven't actually touched Animal Crossing yet, which I'm really kind of
1701260	1706860	upset with myself about, but I've had a lot going on. So it's just basically been Dead by Daylight
1706860	1716220	and Fantasian. Though I found an RPG I might be starting called Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion.
1717500	1723900	That sounds fun. And I found a version of Power Washing Simulator for Mac. So I might be starting
1723900	1729340	that. That's fine. I love that game. I've been eating something just a little bit mindless to
1729340	1733660	sit back with after work. It is extremely mindless, extremely. I haven't played it in a while, but
1734220	1740700	it's extremely mindless. Well, the other thing going on is that I may have a period coming up
1740700	1747020	where I'm off work for about three weeks and I am thinking about doing a stream every day.
1747900	1751900	Ooh, that's a big challenge. So I can get that stream for 25 or 30 days
1752540	1761660	achievement. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, right now, I can talk about it later,
1761660	1769100	but I've got stuff coming up soon that it's going to require me to be off all of my meds.
1769820	1777260	Look out world. Cold turkey. Well, let us know how we can help. If we can help. Probably just
1777260	1782700	don't talk to me. Well, if you have to take time off the show or something, let us know whatever
1782700	1790300	we had to do. We'll see. We'll see. But at any rate, I will probably be playing and cussing at
1790300	1798700	a lot of games during that time period. And I will let everyone know. All right. Well, if that's it
1798700	1803660	for your gaming week, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week? So my week was pretty much just
1803660	1810620	playing Minecraft. I've been really trying to hustle to put out my next video. So I've been
1810620	1815500	working on that. I have a large build that I did. Probably a little bit too large for one video,
1815500	1823180	but yeah, I've also distracted myself by playing on another server as well. So I've been doing
1823180	1827820	that. Probably splitting my time between two servers is not the best thing to get weekly
1827820	1835820	videos out. But you know, it's fine. And then what else? So I've been thinking a lot about
1835820	1843980	doing the about the physical release of Pixel Poops number two. So we've got this Sacramento,
1843980	1848220	they have like a game expo thing, classic game expo, not really classic game expo. It's like a
1849340	1854460	gaming expo that they do in December. It's a mini convention. Yeah. Yeah. I like mini convention.
1854460	1860620	I went to it last year. It's pretty fun. But they've got a lot of like retro collector
1863500	1868220	YouTubers and personalities that are going to be attending as well. And I think it might be a good
1868220	1874540	idea to hand out some physical freebies for them. Get your game in front of people. Absolutely.
1875500	1883260	YYR, I would imagine. I mean, hopefully he's listening and can confirm or deny with a tweet
1883260	1889020	or something. But going to Magfest and getting that game, his various games in front of people,
1889020	1894780	like nothing sells that super multitasking like playing it and showing it to people like that's
1894780	1901500	how you sell that game. And so I think that's a big thing. Yeah. And I think especially if you're
1901500	1907580	going to go to a game gaming show and say, here is this game that I made and you can buy it right
1907580	1912220	now, scan this QR code or pay me ten dollars. Well, you'd have to have a vendor license for
1912220	1916300	that. So you want to get careful with that stuff. Yeah, they had this. And I thought about that.
1916300	1920300	I just don't think I'd be able to attend both days. So that's why I haven't been doing it. But
1921900	1926780	yeah, they've got like I'm trying to think who was there. But, you know, like Pat the NES punk.
1926780	1930220	Oh, you want to get your game in front of people the other way by actually giving them
1931340	1936700	copies of stuff to check out. It's clever. Yeah. They get people talking about it. Sure.
1936700	1940700	Because it's like I've seen a lot of like press coverage of like different games that
1940700	1944300	pretty much have to do a Kickstarter to do get like the coverage because
1945180	1949580	people see all sorts of different NES projects and they like make articles about it and stuff
1949580	1957740	because it's a thing to talk about. A game about people pooping on stuff is the NES is going to
1957740	1962940	make articles and that has clickbait material. It's just like, can you believe what's coming
1962940	1969900	on the NES? I mean, just. Can you believe this poop? I see dark soccer trying to drop a zinger,
1969900	1975820	but you're muted. You should have a catchphrase. Just get shit on. Get shit on.
1977740	1981900	But yeah, something like that, just need to put it out there. I do want to make physical copies,
1981900	1990780	though. I have to check. I need to really like source like packaging and whatnot. There's like
1990780	1994700	different companies you can work with. Like, I know the one that they got the coverage on
1994700	2002540	broke studios is to actually purchase my hard my actual boards through and they also do publishing
2002540	2008060	as well. I just don't know how you you how you get that kind of an agreement. There's other
2008060	2012460	like companies, too, that'll do like kind of publishing. I even see like a little limited
2012460	2016700	run games and stuff will do. Sure. You know, publishing and stuff like that for NES things.
2016700	2021100	I just don't know who to talk to for that kind of stuff, but maybe start broke studios. But
2021100	2027100	there's that there was was at the that magazine thing. So I have to figure out when that's coming
2027100	2036460	out. There's the. There's another nest maker, like not really competition, but they do this
2036460	2041820	thing every year that's almost like a game jam, but this year they're not doing a game jam because
2041820	2047500	of the weird scenario of raising. So they're basically saying you can like submit your game
2047500	2052220	from any game like brand new. It's been out for a while. You publish it already.
2052780	2059820	You can submit as part of this kind of event thing and then they'll do awards and whatnot.
2059820	2067820	So I did that for this year and eventually I'm hoping they get their retroverse set up going
2067820	2071500	because that's supposed to be like a portal where you can actually play games online. You purchase
2071500	2076620	through there and eventually they'll do like, you know, actual physical publishing of different
2076620	2084220	things. That'd be really convenient. But it's going to be a while. So, yeah, I'm still thinking
2084220	2091020	about it. I just have to. Figure out the logistics for it. All right, that's pretty much it.
2092380	2097980	Let's talk about my gaming week. So for my gaming week, I have been continuing to play Pikmin Bloom,
2097980	2104060	which had a community event on Saturday yesterday, which was kind of interesting that that game
2104060	2108300	didn't launch that long ago and it's already having a community event because that game is
2108300	2111900	a little more passive in the way that it plays. You know, the community event was kind of the
2111900	2117020	same way. It was really just, you know, get 10,000 steps within this day for a special badge. But if
2117020	2122780	you are checking the game, the flowers are kind of blooming rarer stuff. I didn't see it, but a
2122780	2127020	friend of mine got a rose to spawn, which I didn't even know roses were in the game. But I mean,
2127020	2131500	makes sense in a game that has a lot of flower stuff. So I guess that was spawning in some
2131500	2136140	circumstances and so forth. So there's a lot of neat stuff going on. And, you know, I've been
2136140	2141180	talking about Pikmin Bloom a lot and I'm like, what is it about this game that, you know, I just
2141180	2145660	keep coming back to? Is it because it is very much a set it and forget it kind of thing? And,
2145660	2149340	you know, it's a little bit of everything, but, you know, just being able to incentivize the
2149340	2154540	walking and, you know, encourage me to get more steps and, you know, get out and exercise and do
2154540	2160940	all that. This game landed really at the right time for me. Something I've talked about on
2160940	2165740	social media this past week, which I guess I should probably bring up here because not all
2165740	2169260	of you follow me on social media. I don't know why. You're certainly making a choice. No, I'm
2169260	2175420	kidding. I get it. But something I talked about in a lengthy post earlier this week is that around
2175420	2182860	Halloween, I found out I have type 2 diabetes, which is probably not a thing that you associate
2182860	2188060	with. You know, everybody thinks of Wilford Brimley, right? The old guy from the Cocoon
2188060	2193100	movie and that stuff and those commercials. So you don't always associate that, but with
2193100	2196540	being a little bit younger, I don't think I'm old. I think I'm still pretty young all things
2196540	2202700	considered. So that was kind of a shock and a shitty thing to find out. And I could sit here
2202700	2209820	and dwell on all the, why did this happen? Genetics. My grandma had it. You know, how,
2209820	2213180	you know, and all this stuff. But I just kind of have to take this news.
2213180	2217980	And with your other issues with having pancreatitis before.
2218620	2219340	Oh, sure.
2219340	2224460	I think that there's a definite link if you were having troubles with processing
2224460	2227180	fats that you're going to have trouble processing sugars.
2227180	2231820	Yeah. But it's, you know, and again, the weird part was is that, you know, again,
2231820	2236380	I've been tested just as part of like a regular blood panel pretty much every year,
2236380	2240460	except last year, because I don't think anyone was going to the doctor's office last year.
2240460	2244700	There wasn't a vaccine yet, et cetera, et cetera. So I had labs done in 2018,
2244700	2251260	completely normal. 2019, completely normal. 2020, pandemic. Now this year,
2251260	2255500	some symptoms start to show up. I get my blood to complete type 2 diabetes,
2255500	2260620	not even a pre-stage, which a lot of people kind of find out for. In two years, I went from normal
2260620	2266780	to wow. And it sucks. And there's no, you know, easy way for me to say it.
2267580	2273100	I also try to remain humble and, you know, so forth in the fact that there's a lot of people
2273100	2277340	I know with type 1 diabetes who have had it since they were very young. And, you know,
2277340	2281900	it's just something they've been dealing with their entire lives. I have had 43 years of,
2283180	2288060	you know, having it okay. So and now just, you know, this is the thing that I have to take on
2288060	2294860	and try to, I don't know if, you know, I don't know. I've heard some things that you can kind
2294860	2299580	of reverse it and kind of put it in remission. You can kind of put it to sleep for a long time.
2299580	2305420	I'm trying not to kid or fool myself. But I'm trying to definitely turn the tide the other
2305420	2312140	direction. And walking, exercise, making that a part of my routine again, because
2312700	2315980	since the pandemic happened, and here's something that's changed in the past two years,
2316540	2320780	I haven't been exercising as much. I'll go on big walks once in a while. I still do think,
2320780	2327820	but when I was working in the office, I would walk on like every break. And I haven't really
2327820	2331980	been doing that since I've been working from home. I think a lot of people have kind of changed a lot
2331980	2338140	of their lifestyle stuff. And that's what allowed those sorts of things to happen in just two years.
2339180	2344380	So my point is, as much as that news sucks, and I'm dealing with it and processing it,
2344380	2350700	and thank you. I see several of you in chat saying, I'm dealing with this too. So thank
2350700	2358700	you. And I really appreciate that. And I see you. Is this whole, okay, if I'm going to do this thing
2358700	2361180	and I'm going to take this head on, am I going to take it seriously? And I'm going to walk
2361820	2367580	and make sure I'm getting my 30 minutes of exercise every single day. Pikmin has been
2368220	2374780	hugely, at the right time, instrumental in motivating me to get out and get some steps
2374780	2380460	and cook these little Pikmin and hatch them and set them off on their missions and all that crap.
2380460	2385740	So if it seems like I'm talking about this game a lot, it's because it was exactly what I needed
2385740	2393820	at the right time, whether it's a good game or not. So I think that's a lot of that. Anyhow,
2394780	2399020	other games that I've been playing this week, I've been playing Forza Horizon 5,
2399020	2409260	because that just came out for everybody this week. Oh, get it, get it. It is magnificent.
2409260	2414700	I mean, and these games are always set up so well that in the first 10 minutes during the
2414700	2422380	introduction, it's like this fucking game, cars flying out of planes, into volcanoes,
2422380	2428140	racing down, doing jumps, whoosh, another car dropping out of a plane. Now you're, I mean,
2428780	2438060	way to show off the game in like 10 minutes. What a masterpiece of the hook, hooking people into
2438060	2441660	wanting to play more of this game. And then, you know, once you really get going and you get
2441660	2446300	settled in the game, it's really lovely that it's like this open world you can do. I mean,
2446300	2453740	has the formula changed from Forza Horizon 4? Not really. It's more of the same. But I asked you,
2453740	2459900	is that a bad thing? Because Forza Horizon 4 was a fucking marvelous game. Obviously, the biggest
2459900	2466380	change with Forza Horizon 5 is it's a new setting. It's Mexico. Lends itself wonderfully to a
2466380	2472780	varying environment and things I don't always think about when it comes to, you know, going
2472780	2478780	to visit Mexico. I wasn't thinking about volcanoes in Mexico ever. I don't associate Mexico with
2478780	2486380	that. But that was really cool. No. I associated with resorts and the beach and that's represented
2486380	2492620	too in the game. I've never been, that's never been what I've associated Mexico with. I've
2492620	2498540	always had to remind myself that they exist. So everybody has their own things, right? And what
2498540	2505180	a beautiful piece of art to put all of that diversity in Mexico on display front and center.
2505180	2511100	One thing I really caught in the opening credits of the game was that there was a partnership with
2511100	2514860	like the Mexican Tourism Board. I don't think that's the actual name of it, but that's what
2514860	2523740	it is. This game partnered with the Mexican Tourism Board and I 150% get why. Because this game
2524300	2533500	will make you want to go to Mexico. It's gorgeous. It looks great. It'll make you want to more.
2533500	2541020	It looks great. And it's just, it's more of that. And you know, the game itself, great. I don't
2541020	2547660	really know what I can say about it. Like it is a top of the line racing game, not a simulator,
2547660	2552620	more of an arcade, but there are so many types of difficulty sliders and accessibility things.
2552620	2556940	So you can make this game as easy or as hard as you want. You can make this game as easy as like,
2556940	2562780	push the accelerator and the rest of the work is done for you mostly. You know, it really depends
2562780	2569500	on what you're looking for in your game, but it's just such a nice little, I'm going to play this
2569500	2574220	game for five minutes, do one little race, and then I'm done. Or I'm going to play this game
2574220	2578780	for three hours and I'm going to do every single little event in this area and find every little
2578780	2582780	board and every little thing. I'm going to do all of this stuff. And that's what I'm going to
2582780	2591900	do in the game today. This game is magnificent. It is a must play. Forza Horizon is Microsoft's
2591900	2602460	flagship series. If you were thinking it was Halo, I'm not so sure anymore. But the nice thing is,
2603260	2608700	it's great that Microsoft is at a point where this is even a discussion because for so many
2609180	2613980	I've heard, you know, Microsoft is nothing but shooty, shooty, bang, bang, Halo,
2613980	2620700	sports types of games. There's nothing on Xbox for me. And if that is, and I've said this before,
2620700	2626700	and with the release of this game, if you are going to continue to say that in the face of
2626700	2635100	this game, I really need you to get your ass out of 2007 and look at what Microsoft is doing now
2635100	2644380	in 2021. It is much different and this game is an achievement. It is absolutely game of the year
2644380	2650540	material and I absolutely expect it to show up on the shortlist when we start talking about five
2650540	2657180	games nominated for game of the year. This game will be one of them. The only complaint I see
2657180	2663180	that people will have about this game is that it's not doing that much more that four didn't already
2663180	2671980	bring to the table. I suppose that's a valid criticism. However, if you eat a cookie and it's
2671980	2677420	really good, like this is the best fucking cookie you've ever had in your life, don't you just want
2677420	2684220	to have another cookie? Like, maybe this is, maybe I shouldn't be the one making this analogy right
2684220	2693980	now, but it's all I can think of. It's great. Anyway, let's see, TigerClodChat says,
2693980	2699180	Halo is overrated. It's all about the Forza now. I think depending on who you are, yeah,
2699180	2704300	and there'll be people that will say that, no, the Microsoft franchise is Gears. Gears is better than
2704300	2710540	Halo for the following reason, or the flagship series is, you know, Ori and the Blind Forest,
2711500	2714460	or the Ori series, which I certainly would not fault you for saying that either.
2717740	2723340	I think the interesting thing about this game is that more than anything, I was sitting here
2723340	2732060	playing this game going, this studio, and this engine, and this concept of do a little, do a lot,
2732060	2740300	do a quest over here, a quest over there. This is the new Fable studio. This studio is working
2740300	2746460	on the new Fable game. I'm very excited about that. My expectations for the new Fable game are
2746460	2753020	so fucking high right now, and I know, and I am the first one to say, don't get your expectations
2753020	2764700	out of control for games ever. Too late. No, I can't, Dark Sakura, because this game is too good.
2766220	2772540	It just sets up, you know, like Fable, like I imagine what Fable can be within this,
2772540	2778940	and it's just, I'm like, I'm so excited, and the bar is so high, and it is Playground Studio's fault
2779580	2789420	for doing that. So, anyway, Mr. Izos in chat says, never played a Forza Horizon game, but man,
2789420	2794380	watching videos and reading reviews, I'm going to get this for sure. Looks really fun. Best argument
2794380	2800540	for Game Pass right now. Incredible argument for Game Pass right now. So anyway, Forza Horizon 5,
2800540	2804220	it's great. Rob Roberts said the quote, put it on the back of the box. It's great.
2804540	2812140	Um, we have a club here at VOG Network, so if you search for the tag V-O-G, which I don't think
2812140	2816940	people could repeat tags, so I think we grabbed it. I don't know what else uses that acronym,
2816940	2826300	but okay. Maybe there's fans of that volcano and the fog that it produces, but that tag is now ours
2826300	2830300	at the Voicegeeks Network. So we do have a club, so I encourage you to look it up if you are playing
2830300	2836940	Forza Horizon 5. I'm hoping to, in the coming weeks, I don't want to promise next week,
2836940	2840780	obviously, with what I just told you and everything, I've been dealing with a lot lately,
2840780	2845260	but hopefully things will settle down in the next couple weeks, and we can look at maybe doing like
2845260	2851020	a Forza night here on the stream and, you know, play together and all that stuff. So, we'll see.
2854860	2858460	The other thing I want to point out, one other game I played this week, and Loki,
2858540	2861900	I really thought of you because this really seemed like the type of game that was up your alley.
2862700	2866300	It was on Game Pass, so it was one of those things when I was scrolling through to see what's new,
2866300	2870620	I saw this and I was like, okay, I have to check this out. It's a game called Kill It With Fire.
2870620	2876140	Have you seen this? I know what the game is, yes. I've heard of it. Okay, so you start in this
2876140	2882220	little house and then what happens, these spiders show up and you will stop at nothing to kill these
2882220	2887900	spiders, meaning you're throwing televisions at them, you're throwing game consoles at them,
2887900	2892380	you are breaking bookshelves, and then at some point you find a can of hairspray in a match and
2892380	2897340	you're setting things on fire, but with the all-important purpose of killing these little
2897340	2903740	fuckers. And what a brilliant concept for a game, because how many times has somebody said to you,
2903740	2908060	oh my god, I just saw a spider, and your response is, well, you got to burn the house down now.
2908060	2913100	Like, you know, somebody literally made a game out of that little joke, and so that's really cute.
2913580	2920540	I'm gonna be honest, it didn't play, it didn't snap as well as I, like, I was throwing the TV
2920540	2925500	at the spider many times because I just, I'm not sure if I was understanding the trick on how to
2925500	2930220	do it or what the deal is. It's much easier when I have a gun, and yes, at the end of the first level
2930220	2935820	you get a gun and you start shooting the spiders, that I get, but like, I was, until I looked up and
2935820	2941980	saw that this game was originally made for mobile devices, and so I was like, oh, you were, you were
2941980	2944860	probably, yeah, you were probably throwing the furniture, well, at least, or it came out on
2944860	2949180	mobile devices, so you're probably throwing the furniture like pokeballs, and it probably
2949180	2953420	kind of plays a little bit better in that regard on a mobile device. So that's my little-
2953420	2954780	What if you like spiders?
2956060	2961980	Then don't play this game, because you do nothing but kill them in this game, so that's it. And the
2961980	2966620	little music will come up and, you know, like, it's really funny. Like, there's a lot of the
2966620	2972700	presentation that's really well done in the game, but I just, I had, I felt it was very unforgiving
2972700	2978620	in its first level in just, like, how to play it, but at the same time, you can't lose it either.
2978620	2982860	Like, they're not poisonous spiders who, like, try to bite you or eat you or anything, so there is,
2982860	2988700	or at least not in the first level. I don't know what happens beyond that yet, but yeah, I felt,
2988700	2992300	it just took me too damn long to kind of get through that first level, because it was kind of
2992300	2999020	hard. So that's my only kind of thing there, but I love the idea as a concept for a game,
2999020	3002540	and maybe in a sequel, especially if they kind of have the consoles in mind,
3002540	3005820	maybe they'll kind of be able to make something that snaps a little more, and hopefully this game,
3005820	3010700	you know, does well for them, so. Okay, I think that's about it for my gaming week. I've talked
3010700	3022220	enough. No. Me? Talk? All right, let's get into some other gaming news. Let's get to Loki,
3022220	3024860	and starting us off with news. I was trying to think if there's any housekeeping. I don't think
3024860	3030540	we have any tonight, so we'll just get right out into some other. Okay. Never mind. It's not big.
3031420	3035740	Are you sure? Okay. Sure. All right, then let's go to Loki with our headline tonight.
3036300	3042700	Yeah, so the Steam Deck has been delayed, unfortunately, and it's thanks to the wonderful
3042700	3049180	chip shortage that we're still in in the middle of, so supply and change and whatnot. I think,
3049180	3055820	though, it's only being delayed, though, until, well, a few months. So, they're going to start
3055820	3062780	shipping to customers starting February 2022. So, if you obviously were in queue to get,
3062780	3067260	you know, a Steam Deck around that time, it's going to be pushed back even further, obviously.
3068060	3074620	So, it's about two months delay, but at least it's still coming to be expected, I suppose.
3074860	3084540	Along with that, the little indie kind of handheld play date has been delayed to 2022 because the
3084540	3090540	battery life on the first units that they put out weren't very long, and they are looking to improve
3090540	3097100	that. So, that's too bad. I hope you weren't looking for new hardware this year. I'm surprised
3097100	3101980	that the battery life on that would be pretty low because the type of screen that has on there,
3101980	3106460	it's got like one of those old e-reader screens, kind of like the e-papers type things.
3106460	3111660	I'm surprised. I don't think those are very battery draining, but I guess.
3111660	3115980	Well, it sounds like the creators were a little surprised that it couldn't get better battery
3115980	3120860	life either. So, you know, they were very transparent, you know, with all their reasons.
3120860	3125660	It's hard to read what those Playdate creators kind of put out there and not like understand
3125660	3131500	what's happening. It's a level of transparency, I bet we wish, from a lot of gaming companies.
3132380	3136700	At least they're willing to fix the mistakes and not just push it out the door.
3136700	3141660	Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, yeah, I'm sure this Stream Deck news is frustrating for a lot of
3141660	3147260	people, but then, you know, you look at this as the yin to the story we just talked about at the
3147260	3152300	top of the show, Yang, and it's like, all right, push it back because it's got to be, well, and if
3152300	3157020	literally the parts aren't there or the parts are not arriving to get them done, it's also kind of
3157020	3165100	like we literally can't make them. So what do we do? You know, that's it. So that's, you know,
3165100	3168780	it's a bummer for the folks that we're looking forward to those for the holiday or even early
3168780	3173820	2022. But maybe it'll just help them be that much better by the time they're released.
3175500	3179020	Yes, that's what we've got to tell ourselves, right? I would love to get one of the I want
3179020	3184460	to see really what the I have a few friends that pre-ordered that Playdate. I have some that did
3184460	3189660	the Stream Deck too, or sorry, Steam Deck. The Stream Deck is a different thing. I had some that
3189660	3195180	ordered the Steam Deck and I'm curious to see that. I really am. But I'm really, really curious
3195180	3199900	for this Playdate because the games on Steam Deck, I know what they're all going to be. I've played
3199900	3205420	all those games. I'm curious about what and the crank and everything that like what this Playdate
3205420	3209820	really kind of brings to the table. I'm very curious to see, you know, for an indie, you know,
3209820	3214140	again, I know it's not competing with the likes of the Nintendo Switch or anything. It is very much
3214140	3219980	an indie console. But I'm curious for that reason what it brings to the table. A lot of the indies
3219980	3227100	have brought a lot of good shit to the table. So, yeah, be interesting. All right. Moving on,
3227100	3235740	let's talk about what's going on with Dead by Daylight. So we talked a little bit, Dark Soccer
3235740	3241100	and I talked about how the public test build came out earlier this week and it featured a brand new
3241100	3249020	killer, the artist and a brand new survivor who's a CIA agent. And that talk aside, because it
3249020	3252940	doesn't matter, you know, some of you guys love it when we talk to it by daylight. Some of you are
3252940	3257660	like, fast forward, fast forward. And like, look, they're talking about that Debbie person again.
3258620	3263260	No matter where you are on the issue, this is not what you think because this isn't really about the
3263260	3269340	game itself. But it's about a problem that is recurring in the gaming scene and it's showing
3269340	3274940	up in a really nasty way this week because of the Dead by Daylight public test build. And what's
3274940	3279900	happening is that Dead by Daylight streamers are getting attacked with denial of service attacks,
3279900	3287100	sometimes known as DDoS attacks, also doxing and in some pretty extreme and shitty cases,
3287660	3296140	swatting. So let's see, some tweets and things that have gone out. A YouTuber named John Wolf
3296140	3301180	sent out a tweet getting DDoSed repeatedly on stream tonight. So that was fun. Not sure I'll
3301180	3305260	be streaming tomorrow unless I can figure out how to prevent it. I've had people DDoS the game
3305260	3309820	server I was playing on before, but this was an attack on my home network. Any advice would be
3309820	3316060	appreciated, by the way. So here's the thing is that when you play on the public test build,
3316700	3320780	as I understand it in dark soccer, you'll feel free to jump in if you have a different
3320780	3325820	understanding. But when you're playing the live game Dead by Daylight, you are connecting to a
3325900	3332060	server and then everything is happening through the server. In the public test build, you are
3332060	3337820	connecting peer to peer, which I think is what Dead by Daylight used to be in the first year or
3337820	3343340	two. And then it went to the server and now the public test build is done again, peer to peer.
3344380	3350220	And that correct. Yeah. Okay. So that means when you get match made with strangers,
3351180	3357500	you can't it doesn't show their IP, but you can find it because you're connected to them in a
3357500	3364060	peer to peer environment. A lot of people that play Dead by Daylight, more so than a lot of
3364060	3367980	other games out there, it happens a lot of other games, too. But what's unique to this situation,
3367980	3374860	you get a lot of people that put TTV in their name or YT in their name to show that they are
3374860	3381180	a Twitch streamer, because some people like to watch and go back and see what was the match from
3381180	3386140	the killer's perspective or something like that. That is a lot of fun to watch sometimes. In fact,
3387020	3392780	not to digress too much, but I just have to say two streamers that I enjoy and I know Dark Soccer,
3392780	3400220	you really love these folks, too. Losing color, went up against Puddins and his mod squad,
3400220	3406620	which included epic, which includes Flea, who sometimes is here at or high if you're out there.
3406620	3411260	But anyway. Yeah. And Flea streams, too. So a shout out for his streams. But the point is
3411260	3416060	those two got randomly not in the PTV, but I just want to tell us this and decide those two got
3416060	3423100	randomly matched against each other. And because the killer can see who the survivors are losing
3423100	3431820	color knew right away. It's Puddins. The others didn't know until, oh, God, it's a nurse. Oh,
3431820	3436780	God, it's a good nurse. They guessed, though. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was watching Puddins
3436780	3442620	when it happened. I wasn't active in chat. And I was in LC's chat. And Puddins had the
3442620	3448300	rain or they saw the rainbow flag and they were like, oh, they said, somebody check losing color
3448300	3453500	stream. Is he live? And somebody came back and said, yep, he's live. And like, Puddins put out
3453500	3459340	this off. Fuck, it's over. Like type of thing. But anyway, I tell you all that because there is a lot
3459340	3463180	of enjoyment. And you know what I did after I watched that match on Puddins and watch the
3463180	3469340	survivor and losing color cleaned house, of course, on that match, because, oh, yeah. Well,
3469340	3474220	they did. And Puddins team made the mistake. They didn't know because they don't know who the killer
3474220	3481500	is or what. They played the best. They played losing colors. Absolute favorite map. They played
3481500	3485660	the offering for that map because they had a different game plan in mind. They didn't know
3485660	3491660	it would be nurse and losing color. So when losing color saw that offering pop up, he was like a
3491660	3497580	present. Anyway, it was pretty funny. Well, and I was like, oh, my God, I know everybody in this
3497580	3503820	party. So I had the both of them open side by side. I know this because I watch and then I
3503820	3507820	went immediately back and I watched losing color. I watched on on their channel, too. And it was
3507820	3513180	really fun to watch it from both sides. That's why people put TV in their name, because there's
3513180	3517340	a lot of survivors. I know that if they find out the killer was a TV here, they go back and watch
3517340	3520700	it from the killer's perspective to see where they fucked up. And I think that's kind of neat.
3521820	3526060	And vice versa. You can do vice versa to Jamie that one time during one of your charity streams,
3526060	3531260	you like to be one three V ones and played against me. I went back and watched you play the match
3531260	3535660	because I wanted to see I got you real good with a pebble at one point. And I wanted to see what
3535660	3540380	that looked like on your end because I don't really know. So anyway, did you not hear me
3540380	3546140	say I bet this is a pebble and I went anyway? You did. You did. Anyway, that was fun. Anyway,
3546140	3551820	my point is. People put TV for that positive good reason, it helps grow their community,
3551820	3556300	but now we're seeing the bad side of this. They're forgetting to remove the TV when they
3556300	3560780	go on public test build because they're not necessarily thinking about this. This isn't
3560780	3566140	at the forefront of their mind. And now people are seeing here's your IP address and you're a
3566140	3573580	TTV or and now some people are doing a denial of service attack or, you know, multiple packets
3573580	3580540	flinging at the server and such as this YouTuber step did. However, these are VPNs and that's what
3580540	3585580	a lot of people are saying. Also, I want to mention this is very important to there is an option in
3585580	3591020	steam and I in the moment I forget where it is. Dark soccer. Maybe you know from from seeing this
3591020	3597980	there is an option in steam you can configure that says do not show my IP under any circumstance.
3597980	3603660	It will make it longer for you to get a match. But as far as I'm concerned, hearing about this,
3603660	3609980	who cares? Two times are long anyway. Take the few extra seconds. Hide your IP. That is an option
3609980	3617020	available to you in steam. I feel like and I'm not techie enough to know this. I'm going to
3617020	3622140	defer to chat on this and I'm not in our discord. We have a lot of great tech people that tweet us
3622140	3628140	and describe it. Couldn't they still packet sniff it out? Even if you're hiding your IP?
3629260	3633020	If it's clear to appear, you always have that risk. If you're like someone that's playing
3633740	3638700	in that match or whatever, you could probably sniff out the other person's IP. But if you use
3638700	3645740	a VPN, it's not going to matter. So I may argue that steam functionality may actually not be easy.
3645740	3650460	It may not be enough if they really want to get you. But I am not technical minded to really say
3650460	3655340	yes, no one way or the other. My real advice is do not put TTV or YT in your name when you're on
3655340	3661260	the test realm. That's that's my humble opinion. I don't even I don't have the option to change
3661260	3666220	my name and I don't want to do it. Yeah, same. I don't want to do it at all. And I play on Stadia,
3667180	3673420	which if you want a protected experience and not have to wait for updates and not have to
3673980	3678300	deal with some of the bullshit like steam maintenance, play on Stadia.
3680220	3686220	Now, there's more to this story. It's not just DDoS. Another streamer who I'm familiar with,
3686220	3692940	but I can't confess I've watched a lot of. Elex? Yeah, Elex. There is a lot of people that enjoy
3693180	3698780	and please absolutely. I've been reading her tweets. Yeah. If I could absolutely no disrespect
3698780	3703340	when I say I don't I just there's so many great people on Twitch and so little time to watch them
3703340	3709260	all. I am familiar with with Elex, but I'm not super familiar. But it is one of those things
3709260	3714540	where I'm like, oh, that's a friend of a friend. I know this. I know of this person. Right. You
3714540	3719500	know how that sometimes that right. You feel like two degrees separated from this. So Elex,
3719500	3723500	who does a lot of streaming and drag and I think is very well known for being a very adept Hag
3723500	3727660	player in the game, which is one of the killers. Hag is the one that draws the traps on the ground.
3728700	3737100	Elex was swatted during PTB while live and like has the receipts to prove it showed the
3737980	3741180	because I did see this make its way around, because, again, I follow people that are in
3741180	3747260	Elex's circles. I saw the retweets of like the blink security camera footage of Elex walking
3747260	3752300	out the door with their hands up. But I thought, you know, what was the really fascinating part
3752300	3758380	of this story? One of the cops recognized Elex from Dead by Daylight streaming and knew what
3758380	3765260	was happening at that moment. Yeah. So nice, but very much. Yeah. It's into the ruler. Yeah,
3765260	3772780	it doesn't. Yeah, no. And it it's just a really phenomenal like twist in the story.
3772860	3778700	But it certainly does not change. It's shitty. I'm sure it was scary and absolutely unnecessary
3778700	3786220	for Elex. And it's a horrible situation. Here's what I don't understand. And I have to ask my
3786220	3792300	tech people. I'm going to confess. I am ignorant to this. I need to understand this so that it
3792300	3799980	doesn't happen to me. So Loki help. Chatters help. How does Elex's IP getting out lead to swatting?
3800940	3805820	I didn't know you could pinpoint somebody's home address with an IP address. How did they do that?
3805820	3811740	I've done it before. I haven't swatted anybody I'm saying, but remember when Timmy, his buddy,
3813180	3820140	was doing targeted harassment at me. I found the IP address. That was a long time ago. Holy moly.
3820140	3828140	Yeah. And it was attached to his home address. How? When I replied back, this was a while ago
3828140	3833500	when it was a lot less security on the web. Okay. But to be fair, that's not where we're
3833500	3836860	at now. I appreciate the insight, but I still don't understand. How do we get there?
3837900	3845820	But I'm saying the possibility is still out there. Especially if you've got contacts,
3845820	3851340	if you have other methods of doing it, it's still out there. You can get a home address from an IP
3852060	3857100	if you're not using a VPN. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about it or how that's possible, but
3857980	3862940	Like me, I'm actually installing a VPN. Oh, yeah. And there's a lot of them out there.
3862940	3867580	So yeah. Pod Culture and Chat says you can go through the ISP, but if you're Danny Dickhead,
3867580	3871580	you can't just call Comcast and say, I need to find out who's at this IP address. They're not
3871580	3877980	going to give it to you. So I'm not understanding. I mean, clearly it's possible. Unless you say
3878700	3882700	someone from this IP address issued this threat and send that to the police.
3882700	3889740	Hmm. I don't think that would work. It would work actually.
3889740	3897020	I here's, here's, here's why I bring it up is that I wonder if Elex wasn't targeted
3898140	3903100	before this public test build stuff and kind of maybe outside of that. And it just kind of
3903100	3907900	happened to time up with that. Again, I want to make very clear. This is a disgusting thing that
3907900	3913900	happened. The swatting business needs to stop. Danny Dickhead and whoever is making these calls,
3913900	3919900	they need to be brought to justice and spanked publicly. And I, you know, I can mean that in,
3919900	3923500	you know, whatever way you want to interpret that as far as what the punishment ought to be.
3925020	3930540	But was it really cause of public test build or has, has somebody been working on doing this for
3930540	3935980	a while? Unfortunately, it doesn't either way. It's not right. It's yeah, it's still disgusting
3935980	3940540	at the end of the day, but I just, I'm not understanding how an IP address leads to within
3940540	3948060	the same evening, the cops showing up, but here's what I do want to say. And by the way, I do want
3948060	3953100	to shout out, uh, Jason, uh, over in our chat room did point out the way to do that and steam
3953100	3958140	and hide the IP address. Thank you. Steam preferences, in game tab, steam networking
3958140	3964780	set to never. If you're paranoid in a rightly minded way, you can also do friends only and
3964780	3970620	always he points out default is an option, whatever that means. So I think default is
3970620	3975980	always, yeah, that's kind of where I'm at to default. I've had my set for friends only for
3975980	3982860	a while. That's that's then again, that should be dead by daylight on steam on steam. True, true.
3983500	3987340	Yeah. You know what? Actually, you probably don't need a VPN. You're playing through stadia.
3988140	3992140	Oh, you can't do test build through stadia though. You're going to have to do exactly.
3992140	3998620	You're going to have to, okay, you can't do test. But, but I do play other things and I do play a
3998620	4009340	few things on steam still, and I play other MMOs. And so I want to have a VPN for specific purposes.
4010300	4015900	I want to have the option of using it. So I'm reading this story about the whole thing
4016860	4023260	and there's a passage in and I'm looking at this story was reported everywhere. I did a search on
4023260	4028620	Google News and this article at gamerant.com came up about this whole thing. And there's a sentence
4028620	4034860	in here I want to address. A paragraph. Tech savvy individuals who may have dealt with such cyberware
4034860	4039740	vulnerabilities before suggests a VPN which allows for encrypted private networking as a default line
4039740	4045500	of defense. Okay. Yep. It is currently unclear why dead by daylight streamers are being targeted
4045580	4050940	specifically, though it has ensued rampantly in the past week across a seemingly indiscriminate
4050940	4055340	number of streamers. So perhaps it is a security breach that has been left vulnerable through the
4055340	4060860	game itself. I'd like to address that sentence. It is currently unclear why dead by daylight
4060860	4066220	streamers are being targeted specifically. I'd like to propose an answer and it's not what you
4066220	4073420	want to hear. Dark Sakura, I bet our answers are the exact same. Why are dead by daylight streamers
4073500	4083340	being targeted? They are targeting anyone with the LGBTQIA tag or people of color or gender variant.
4084460	4089660	Because it is. Yeah, they are targeting dead by daylight streamers because dead by daylight
4089660	4097180	is extremely popular amongst all of those minority groups. That's the unfortunate truth.
4098140	4104300	So, Game Rant, I think you should update your article. No one wants to say this out loud,
4104300	4109500	but I think we have to. So, Game Rant, I think you should say it, too. This is why dead by
4109500	4115580	daylight streamers are being targeted. This is why Elex, a drag performer, was likely targeted
4116300	4121500	well before the public test build stuff. And I mean, I know it's a big elephant in the room,
4121500	4126620	right? Yep. It's a big elephant. But you're not going to get it out of the room until you
4126620	4132380	recognize that it's there and haul it out, right? And if that kill it with fire game taught us
4132380	4139260	anything, you need to find that spider, move the couch, shine a light on it, and then spray it with
4139260	4144860	fire. And that's the only way we're going to be able to do it. Spiders eat mosquitoes, Rob. They
4144860	4152700	deserve to live. They're fake spiders. I love that here we are talking about a game dead by daylight
4152700	4158380	where on a daily basis, you're in there murdering people horrifically. And you're like, but spiders.
4159500	4162620	Well, spiders. People are terrible. Spiders are awesome.
4165180	4168460	Unless they're funnel webs and then get them far away from me. They'll get one of
4168460	4172780	this. They'll have a spider as one of the killers here pretty soon. Oh, I can't wait.
4175100	4180220	Now, one other, sorry, I know I've talked a lot about this story, but it's a lot going on here.
4180220	4184380	And obviously this is a community I've spent a lot of time with. Behavior Interactive, who are
4184380	4188460	the developers of the game, it's called out that they're not really, they haven't really tweeted
4188460	4192220	about it. They haven't said anything about it. They're not really quote unquote doing anything
4192220	4200620	about this. I have to admit, like, look, there's a lot of things we could ask Behavior about and how
4200620	4206700	they run their business. What do you want them to do? What do they, the only thing that they can do
4206700	4211820	is change their PTB streaming. To change it from-
4211820	4213580	To server. They could.
4213580	4218140	Make it server instead of peer to peer. And adding it to server then means that it opens up
4218860	4223820	PTB for people on console and streaming services.
4223820	4229820	Yeah. But what otherwise do you want them to do? Do you want them to send a tweet saying,
4229820	4237980	don't swat people? Like, why should companies have to tweet out, be a decent fucking human being?
4237980	4244940	Like we don't have that same expectation for Xbox to tweet out, hey, don't be an asshole on Xbox Live.
4244940	4246140	Be less of a dick, see who plays.
4246140	4252860	And you know, I have a catchy, you know, I have a catchy catchphrase for their public campaign.
4252860	4255020	It's just, what, how about not?
4255020	4260540	I don't want to laugh because it's not a laughing matter.
4261340	4262460	So that was pretty funny.
4262460	4264460	So screw you for that joke. All right.
4264460	4266060	It's called gallows humor. It's allowed.
4266060	4269260	Yes, I get it. Laughing at funerals and all that stuff. Sometimes it's
4269260	4275980	the only thing you know how to do. I mean, sure, Behavior should probably say,
4275980	4280540	hey, warning, you might want to take these precautions when playing on the public test
4280540	4284700	build. We want to remind our audience when you play on the PTB, these things happen.
4284700	4289820	I guess I could see Behavior kind of doing that, but I think y'all that are tweeting in all caps
4289820	4295500	at them are not making your message clear. You just want, you want Behavior to say something.
4296380	4301260	What do you want them to say? Guess what? All gamers need to hear it.
4301260	4304540	All people need to hear it. Don't be a shit.
4304540	4311980	And people are also trying to bring Twitch in on this because it is predominantly streamers being
4311980	4318140	targeted. But the thing is that in this particular case, Twitch is actually fairly innocent.
4318140	4321820	I don't know how they can control their viewers necessarily. I mean, you can't,
4321820	4324700	you can't. Well, they're comparing it to the hate raids.
4325740	4331500	We, this is those solely having to do with the dead by daylight PTB.
4332060	4336940	We need and what we need, the person we need to make a statement on this
4336940	4342620	is your local Congress representative. And guess what? Most of them aren't going to give a fuck
4342620	4348060	because they're going to go, oh, that's a Gen Z thing. Well, Gen X here to tell you,
4348780	4353820	number one, we need more representation of different generations within Congress and
4353820	4358620	making these types of decisions for this reason. This is one of the many reasons why,
4359420	4362860	no matter whether you're liberal, conservative, somewhere in between,
4362860	4369980	this is why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was extremely possible, possible, extremely popular
4369980	4375020	when she went to Twitch and did her stream with the other representatives that she did that with
4375020	4381740	and so forth, because she was speaking a language a lot of people wish their politicians would speak.
4383100	4387100	She was addressing people in a way that, you know, there's a whole, there's many, many,
4387100	4392380	many people here on Twitch. So anyway, my point with this is we need our Congress people to
4392380	4396540	understand that this is an issue. And I do see, and it is important to say S200 Matt in chat says,
4396540	4400140	swatting is already a federal crime, yet these pieces of trash continue to do it.
4400140	4403820	They're so full of themselves that they can get away with it while they eventually get caught.
4403820	4409420	A lot of damage is already done by that time. That is why parents of minors need to be held
4409420	4415900	responsible in these circumstances. That is the federal legislation that ought to be out there,
4415900	4420620	for sure. Parents of minors who are committing these offenses need to be held responsible.
4420620	4425580	And I know that, I know politically that's not going to land with all of you and I'll just smile
4425580	4433340	and nod and say, then how do we end this? That's not the only step we need to take. The offenses
4433340	4441180	for this, you know, need to go higher. The way to track these sorts of reports needs to be higher.
4441580	4449500	I'm going to actually say that parents and children doing this should both be sent to jail.
4449500	4456380	If somebody with a four digit internet number playing dead by daylight can be tracked to their
4456380	4463980	address, why can't someone phoning in or internetting in a report? The government's
4463980	4468540	technology needs to catch the fuck up. And that's the other thing that needs to happen.
4468540	4470460	That's why the Congress people have to get involved.
4470460	4474700	They can't just call in all these fake swaths from anonymous numbers.
4474700	4479500	That's it. SG100 Matt saying our internet crime response networks are still playing catch up a
4479500	4487180	lot of the time. And that's the problem. We need to invest in that. Okay. I've talked a lot, a lot,
4487180	4491740	a lot about that. Anyhow, there's more gaming news to get into. So I'm going to kick it over
4491740	4497980	to the next story, Dark Sakura. So Quantic Dream
4497980	4503100	is a company that, well, I may not have been fans of some of their practices, but I fucking
4503100	4510780	love Detroit Become Human. I'm actually rewatching the whole good playthrough again from a PS5
4510780	4523420	recording. But there is a big rumor with quite a bit of evidence behind it, that they are working
4523420	4534620	on a Star Wars High Republic era game with the name Eclipse. They're going to call it Star Wars
4534620	4541580	Eclipse. And then it was corroborated by some pretty reliable industry insiders.
4543100	4549820	And also there is evidence that now Quantic Dream has finished their contract with Sony.
4549820	4555420	They're signing with Disney for projects, which would make it absolutely right that they do a
4555420	4565180	Star Wars game. But I mean, the theory is that it is going to be a lot more action oriented than
4565180	4573580	just the QuickTime event control every last little thing somebody does game like Heavy Rain or Beyond
4573660	4579980	Two Souls or Detroit. It's definitely going to be more of an action game. And they're also
4579980	4586540	talking about there being open world and multiplayer elements to it. But while a lot has
4586540	4599340	been peripherally corroborated, I'm still not going to be too behind it until I see more evidence.
4600300	4604940	I mean, the people on the inside, the people in the know are saying all evidence points to yes
4604940	4614220	on their Magic 8 Ball. So it's one of those rumors with a lot of fire around it right now. So yeah,
4614220	4618060	I got a text message from one of my friends super into Star Wars that was like, why didn't you tell
4618060	4622460	me about this? And I was like, I literally didn't know until today when I was looking at the notes
4622460	4628460	for this week's show. And it's still in a rumor status, really. So yeah, well, in High Republic
4628460	4634540	games, I mean, there were all of those books, you know, but I think all of the books were
4635660	4641820	rendered like alternate universe now are no longer official canon. So maybe this is going
4641820	4646460	to be part of a way that they can write what their official canon is going to be for this. I don't
4646460	4655900	know. E3 Vialant. Oh, sorry. I was just going to say, given the quality of their other titles for
4655900	4661500	the technology it was released on, I would have really high hopes for how this game turns out.
4663100	4667340	Is it all going to be about like Senate debates? Because that would be amazing.
4667340	4671820	This is an action oriented game. There's not much action in the Senate.
4671820	4676300	There's lots of action in Senate debates. That was the best part of the original trilogy.
4676940	4682700	Unless someone brings out a lightsaber and takes offense at the Senator from Tatooine. I don't
4682700	4690060	know. I have trade agreements and stuff like that. I can't wait. I'm filing this report on you.
4690060	4694860	There was a comment in chat by E3 Vialant. It wasn't about Star Wars directly, but it was
4694860	4699180	because Disney, Marvel and all that got brought up. E3 Vialant did bring up the current Guardians
4699180	4703900	of the Galaxy has a good story. Yeah. You know, I have to say I haven't played that game myself yet,
4703900	4709100	but I'm considering a few people were kind of apprehensive about that after like Avengers and
4709180	4715340	some of the other, like it turns out that that game is landing really well with a lot of people.
4715340	4719500	And I got to say, I'm interested in it in a way out and I've never seen the movies. And that's
4719500	4725420	probably why it kind of has been under my radar. But I did the ride at Disneyland finally. So at
4725420	4734220	least there's that. So I understand that part. But I'm curious about the game. I have to say,
4734220	4740540	I want to check it out. It sounds kind of up my alley. So we'll see. It's just it's $60. And I'm
4740540	4745660	like, oh, $60. And there's a Final Fantasy 14 expansion out in two weeks. It's going to take
4745660	4750460	all my time. I already paid for mine. By the way, I forgot to mention during my gaming week,
4750460	4757020	but I need to say every job, every class, max level and Final Fantasy 14 as of Wednesday or
4757020	4765020	Thursday night, I did it. We did it. We did it. So now I'm out of things to do in that game. No,
4765020	4770300	I'm I'm working on some of the mounts I still don't have. There's a lot of like grindy sorts
4770300	4775020	of things like Ishgard crafting. I'm missing one of the mounts and tanking a bunch of dungeons and
4775020	4779420	so on. So there is still that. Oh, yeah, that's true. Bobby Black Wolf reminds me I never did
4779420	4784540	finish Yakuza. Oh, yeah, that is a thing. That is a thing I should finish. And then there's going
4784540	4789980	to be more inspiration for games I should finish as we get into the next few weeks and award
4789980	4795980	season. Right, Logie? Exactly. So we have the game awards coming December 9, which is about the same
4795980	4801340	time that they have it every year. This year, they're saying that they're gonna show off 40
4801340	4806780	new games or 40 games, at least I don't know if they're all brand new. And one of the promises
4806780	4813820	because it's been brought up recently, different stories about it, but no game supporting or
4813900	4820940	selling NFTs will be featured in the presentation. Because there's been a lot of drama about
4820940	4826620	different companies supporting NFTs. And we have some more on that coming up.
4827340	4833660	Yeah, I was gonna say one of those being EA, which I trust them fully with NFTs,
4833660	4839900	there's no way they're gonna exploit that. So yeah, it's good to see that they're taking that
4839900	4843900	stance. Honestly, though, that's a really small list of games to exclude from it. But
4845660	4850220	cool. I'm excited. Are we gonna see another No Man's Sky trailer? That's what I really want to know.
4851340	4857820	Hope actually, yes, I would be super into it would be about the because the expedition that I'm I was
4857820	4862620	really trying to beat the current expedition. But I'm on like I have to get the fucking whispering
4862620	4866540	eggs. I have to get like 16 of them. And it's such a pain in the ass. And I don't I think I'm
4866540	4870780	not going to finish because I'm almost out of time. The time is up in like a week. So it is
4870780	4876140	very possible they could launch another expedition and a patch around game awards. You know,
4876140	4879340	sometimes they give it a few weeks between them. They don't do them back to back. So
4879340	4884700	they should sell some DLC, which is honest, is honestly like that with all the content
4884700	4889820	that they put in for free already. It's like, I would buy DLC in a heartbeat. I've put more
4889820	4894460	hours into that game than I think many of you realize. So I have not put enough hours in my
4894460	4903260	game. Let's see. As soon as Matt says can't imagine Forza Horizon five will be nominated
4903260	4908700	for this year's game awards. I hope you meant to say won't be nominated. I just it's got to be
4908700	4915020	there. And then as to Matt says waiting for it to run the table and get game awards 2022. And Bobby
4915020	4918860	Blackwell is pointing out that the game awards is on a Thursday night at eight o'clock Eastern. I
4918860	4925580	mentioned that in case we want to co stream. Okay, so Loki, you might remember when we brought this
4925580	4929180	up a couple weeks ago, I said, Hey, you and I should go down to LA. What do you think?
4929740	4932780	I don't know if you're still keen on that idea or what. But here's the thing.
4934140	4938940	I talked to Alan. And I said, because something about this came up. And I said, Alan,
4938940	4943660	the game awards are LA. I said, What would you think about going down there? Like we drive down
4943660	4947500	Thursday, go to the game awards, and then like just kind of fuck around in LA the rest of the
4947500	4952140	weekend. And he said, Yeah, that'd be fun. I'd be curious what the game awards like in person.
4952140	4962860	Let's go. So I need to, I need to figure out how to get tickets. I think they just sell them.
4964620	4970620	But there's a chance I'm going to go. I'm not going to confirm it until I can get that because
4970620	4973660	I have to make sure my day job commitments are taken care of because we are talking about two
4973660	4979020	days off of work. And I already missed a day this week because of the booster shot and all that
4979020	4983660	stuff. So which is, you know, if you're eligible and meet the criteria, you should consider it,
4983660	4992140	but it just it made me sick. So just plan on it. I think we might go. And that's what I really want
4992140	5001820	to do. Oh, no. Oh, Bobby says they're not selling public tickets this year. You got to be kidding
5002620	5007260	me. No, there went that idea. All right, well, we're still going to try to figure it out.
5008060	5012860	I still want to see if we can go. Of course, the one year I'm able to go, they decide they're not
5012860	5017420	going to sell tickets. Man might be, you know, I'm willing to kind of a break. It might because
5017420	5021420	of covid and all that stuff. They have to, you know, trust that probably they might be doing
5021420	5028220	vaccine checks. I'm triple vaxxed. OK, let's do this. I'll wear a mask indoors. I don't care.
5028940	5035340	All right. Anyway. All right, well, let let I I'm putting that out into the universe.
5035340	5042220	I'd like to go. My husband is supportive of this effort. Let's do it. I want to go. All right.
5042860	5048620	Anyhow, moving on, let's get to our next story. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Is there anything else you
5048620	5053100	want to say about game awards? No, that's it. It's just basically the announcement of that.
5053100	5058860	It's coming. So I'm looking forward to it. I always it's a good presentation every year.
5060700	5067180	All right. Let's talk about this. I'm going to bring up this story, which is a huge rumor.
5067980	5074860	I've been tagged in it a lot because I talk about this game a lot on our. So I get it.
5075580	5081020	It's the rumor going around about one versus one hundred potentially coming back to the Xbox.
5081820	5086380	Of course, we all know this was a big game show. It was so cool because it was actually live. It
5086380	5091340	was originally a game show on NBC and right around it was hosted by Bob Saget. Right. Which was kind
5091340	5097980	of a funny thing, wasn't it? Wasn't it Bob Saget that hosted it? I don't know if it was. Somebody
5097980	5103580	tell me if I'm wrong on that. And anyway, so they did a version on Xbox Live at the same time. It's
5103580	5107260	basically trivia questions and it's one person answering the questions and they're going up
5107260	5113260	against one hundred people. They slowly get eliminated as they get things wrong and all
5113260	5117180	that stuff. And then you can win Microsoft points. There's an actual host and all this stuff.
5117180	5125500	So here's the thing. Now, this is coming from a podcast journalist type of thing. But this is
5125500	5129500	somebody who's been in the industry a while and a lot of people know this name, Jeff Grubb from
5129500	5134460	Giant Bomb. I think a lot of you listen to that show. And this is where this was talked about
5134460	5141340	because Altspace VR is part of like the Microsoft mixed reality and like their relaunch of teams
5141340	5145900	and all this stuff. They're looking at doing something in relation to that with one versus
5145900	5151340	one hundred. So according to him, one versus one hundred is coming back. They are definitely making
5151340	5155900	that game. And it seems like it's coming from the Altspace VR team. They're spearheading the
5155900	5160060	project and all of the avatars we saw in the Microsoft team things last week. They're going
5160060	5168060	to use those avatars and bring that stuff in. So now, of course, it's a rumor. It's a journalist
5168060	5173660	saying this on podcast. But here's here's the thing. He's putting a lot of like that. Those
5173660	5180540	words say a lot. They are definitely making that game. He's wagering a lot by saying that. So he
5180540	5184940	has some type of knowledge that something's going on. Here's the thing that could happen.
5185340	5191020	Will the game release or will it get canceled or they'll decide to shelve it for whatever other
5191020	5196140	reason? That could still happen. One hundred percent. One versus one hundred percent.
5197980	5204300	But we'll just hope that, you know, we'll hope it works out, you know, but there could be a lot of
5204300	5210620	challenges with the networking and all that stuff and so forth. So we'll see what comes of it.
5211100	5215340	But certainly my hopes are very high. I wonder if that also means that, like,
5215340	5221420	oh, it's going to be built into like a PC version. It doesn't like nothing about what he's saying
5221420	5230060	means Xbox Series X, although I think Microsoft would be fools to not have it there. So but we we
5230060	5237020	are jumping a little bit to conclusions. If you want to revive the tea leaves further or I'm
5237100	5241900	sorry, you want to read the tea leaves further. Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox,
5242620	5248300	has dropped hints before. This was during an official Fan Fest live stream October 2020.
5249260	5253500	It was going to be going against a website quiz and the trivia game did not take place.
5254140	5258540	Phil Spencer said, I just want to say when our teams are trying to do new things that we've
5258540	5263260	never done before, I want to be 100 percent behind those things. Sometimes they'll turn
5263260	5267420	out amazing. Sometimes they'll be good learning experiences for us. But for all the fans who've
5267420	5272780	been with us with this on us, we're going to make it good with you guys. We don't know exactly what
5272780	5277900	it is yet. So thanks for hanging with us during this and our little experiment. We'll learn.
5277900	5283660	Maybe we should even be building our own trivia game, like from our past, that allows people to
5283660	5291340	play a trivia game more often. Maybe that could happen. So this isn't the first time he's hinted.
5291340	5297260	He also said in 2019 specifically that one versus 100 is something that they would like to bring
5297260	5305180	back. As far as I'm concerned, all the stars are aligned. And this is in development. It's just
5305180	5309900	a matter of, like I said before, just because it's in development doesn't mean it gets released.
5309900	5316780	A lot happens between now and then. As we've seen. Bobby Blackwell in chat says,
5316780	5320700	this isn't the same as Microsoft promising you something. Microsoft isn't messing with you.
5321580	5326540	I'm going to, I'm going to actually, because you tagged me with this on Twitter and 140 characters,
5326540	5330940	280, whatever, isn't enough to really explain this. So I sassed you back with a GIF.
5332220	5339020	This is why I tagged Microsoft in the tweet. Yes, they are playing with my emotions every day since
5339020	5344540	they canceled it. They could bring that game back anytime they want to, assuming they can get the
5344540	5351180	licensing deals and all that stuff. But the concept of a large live game show, even if it's
5351180	5356780	not one versus 100 itself, and I've said this on the show before, I would like to see come back a
5356780	5362780	live show of sorts. So Microsoft continuing to not do that is what's playing with my emotions.
5362780	5367420	And yeah, I tagged him in the tweet because I wanted to show support. This shit needs to happen.
5367420	5369900	I'm sure no one cares. No one's going to read it. No one's going to see.
5370860	5375020	But I have a feeling a lot of people are tagging Microsoft right now in that,
5375020	5387340	what's going on. So, all right. Anyway, let's move on and talk about other Xbox stuff,
5387340	5393660	which I think is Dark Sakura? Yep. So some of the older 360 games
5393980	5400380	with many Bethesda titles are going to be updated for the Xbox 20th anniversary live stream.
5401100	5407180	Among those games are Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Fable
5407180	5414540	Anniversary, Dead Space, Dead Space 3, Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Fable 3. They've all
5414540	5421020	got updates. We're just not sure what they are. And it's going to be a pretty big event.
5421740	5430380	Supposed to happen on, well, tomorrow for us, November 15th, 2021, exactly 20 years
5430380	5439740	after the launch of the Xbox starting at 10 AM Pacific time, 5 PM GMT. And there are also
5440380	5445740	some rumors about them doing an early release for Halo Infinite's free to play multiplayer.
5445740	5453900	And then a few other surprises that they have, of course, it's not a surprise if we tell you
5453900	5461660	kind of things. But apparently it does look like there has been some kind of update for
5461660	5468860	Halo Infinite store page that says the game will be released on December 8th. There you go.
5468860	5474700	All right. I'd be very curious about the classic. What else can they do for the backwards compatible
5474700	5480620	titles? Unless they went back and did some remasters. Because some of them, like Final
5480620	5488700	Fantasy 13, I've been playing on Xbox thanks to Game Pass. And it looks a lot better. The movies
5488700	5493180	obviously are that better quality and so on. The game just looks a lot better than it did when I
5493180	5498780	first played it. And so I'm curious what other stuff they might be doing to old classic games.
5498780	5504060	I'd also, you all know I'd still love to see the old DDRs be backwards compatible, but I'm sure
5504860	5509900	they're going to say music licensing is what's stopping that, even though I just want to put
5509900	5514940	my disk into this drive and have it reboot. It's whatever. Fine. Whatever. I guess because
5514940	5519260	technically you kind of have to download some of these things. It probably gets into messy legal
5519260	5523020	territory. But I'd be curious to see what else they might bring up with the classic updates.
5523020	5529980	So we'll see. All right. So back to a topic we were talking about a little bit earlier. Right,
5529980	5539900	Loki? You're muted, Loki. Sorry, kids were being loud in the background. So going back to
5540860	5546540	NFTs, as I mentioned, EA was one of the companies that was talking about getting into the NFT space.
5546540	5550540	Well, apparently Square Enix is another company that's looking to get into that
5550540	5555900	space as well, saying that NFTs have high affinity with our assets. Proof of concept
5555980	5561580	phase is over. This means is that they're going to transition to full commercial or
5561580	5566300	full commercialization stage. So they're going to try to sell it to make some money.
5568940	5573420	I don't know, most of the entities I see out there, like most of the news stories and headlines
5573420	5577580	you see, they're just talking about the scams and all the rug pulls that are out there. I just don't
5577580	5582940	know if this is really necessary unless we're talking about like we're going to allow you to
5582940	5592140	resell our digital games or something like that. With all this talk and NFT being a buzzword and
5592140	5597820	the whole investors are going to jump on anything that has the word NFT and all this, I still have
5597820	5604300	yet to understand what is the fucking point? Why would a video game use an NFT? Can somebody
5604300	5610140	explain that to me like I'm five? I understand the concept of the whole you own this thing,
5610140	5615820	like a digital receipt. Why does, why would that work in a video game? How is that different from
5615820	5621900	DLC? You bought a thing that says you own this digitally. Well, here's the thing too.
5621900	5626060	What does the NFT do to that? Kind of funny because, you know, if you look at all the,
5626060	5629900	you know, end user license agreements out there where basically anything that you do purchase
5629900	5634300	nowadays, you don't really own, you just own a license to it. And now they're like, oh, but wait,
5634300	5637420	wait, hold on. Now we want you to actually own something. It's like, well,
5637420	5643020	why can't I just own the digital game that you sold me in the first place? You know,
5643820	5650140	it's, it's really dumb, but I don't really see a point to it aside from it's a buzzword,
5650140	5655900	you know, that people are kind of looking for anything about and it just gets exposure.
5655900	5659820	And people have found ways to make money off of things that really shouldn't be probably worth
5659820	5666780	that much. Like, you know, JPEGs of small little pieces of artwork, like was it Taco Bell made
5666780	5671900	some stuff and they were selling NFTs and it sold for quite a bit of money, a lot more, I'm sure
5671900	5676460	than it was actually put into it. I just think they see money. A lot of these companies are really
5677740	5685500	centered on the money. And unfortunately, Square Enix had some issues with certain games that they
5685500	5690220	put out. Like, was it the Marvel Avengers game where, you know, they basically build the game
5690220	5695900	around monetization through, you know, XP boosts and stuff like that, even though they claim, oh,
5695900	5701180	we're going to walk it back and stuff like that. I don't know. It's just these shady practices
5701180	5706300	that they see opportunities for revenue. And that's really the only driving matter here.
5706300	5708940	I don't think they're going to use them in any sort of meaningful way.
5708940	5713980	Okay. Looking at chat, some people trying to help break it down for me because I am with SSJ 100,
5713980	5719260	Matt, trying to understand NFTs makes my brain feel like I'm 80. I just want to be left alone
5719260	5724860	in my chair so I can nap and watch Judge Wapner. Yes. Very that. That is exactly where I'm coming
5724860	5730380	from. All right. So comments, Bobby Blackwell says, because you could resell it outside of
5730380	5735100	the games company's involvement. That's why they want the NFT. Quest Buster says,
5735100	5739420	so as a devil's advocate, when a rare weapon drops from a mob in an MMO,
5739420	5743820	it can be distinctly tied to you with an NFT, giving it an additional level of value.
5743820	5749980	Okay. What I'm not understanding. I could today, if a rare weapon drops for me in a game,
5749980	5755820	if I really want to, I could go onto a forum and say, Hey, PayPal me five bucks. I'll trade you
5755820	5760860	this weapon in game. I can do that with this. This is outside of that though. So this is like,
5760860	5765180	I can literally, you know, hand you the keys to this weapon and then you can do that.
5765180	5769660	It does have like, if you want to monetize something in that way, it does have like,
5770460	5773820	that's not different. That's not what do you, that's not what I understand. I understand what
5773820	5777980	you're saying, but this actually, I think puts gaming companies in worse situations because
5777980	5784540	they've, you know, they've run a foul of different gambling laws by having loot boxes and stuff,
5784540	5788860	but then they've made the argument that are, well, you can't make any money outside of these games.
5788860	5794860	Like, you know, those FIFA, the FIFA money that you have or whatever, you can't turn that into
5794860	5800700	real money. Well, now that you now with this, you can, you could turn something into real money.
5800700	5805980	And so now they're going to run a foul of those laws again. Like I just, it's not a good idea,
5806940	5811260	but whatever they're going to do it. Bobby explaining to my people's court,
5811260	5816540	loving ass San NFTs use the blockchain. So you are anonymous. That's the difference.
5816540	5821820	PayPal is trackable. Crypto is not crypto is free from the influence of big banks.
5821820	5827740	PayPal is not, you know, if you don't want something, if you don't want a monetary
5827740	5834060	transaction to be tracked, that sounds shady to me. Why are video game companies wanting to get
5834140	5844300	into shady things or any company, any Taco Bell or anybody like, I don't know. I mean,
5844300	5849420	I guess my brain just can't understand this because I'm like, somebody, somebody,
5849420	5853180	somebody somewhere had to have built the blockchain, right? Like somebody, somebody,
5853180	5857420	like I know you say it's, it's all these computers together. Well, with NFT accounts, you can
5857420	5861980	actually, a lot of times you can follow, like, cause they'll have these profiles where they
5861980	5867180	display their NFTs and you can track it back. You know, that's why there is a blockchain. So
5867180	5871660	you can see who it is, but sometimes it may be, you know, may not know who actually owns
5871660	5877260	that account. It's just that, you know, there's an account that has this purchase or that made
5877260	5883180	that purchase. So the whole reason these video game companies want to do this is so that people
5883180	5890140	can do transactions untracked is what I'm kind of, well, and the fact, and I also understand
5890140	5894620	it is a buzzword right now. They're, they're using this word because it makes everybody's
5894620	5900060	ears perk up. When in fact, it sounds like there's a lot of us out there that are like,
5900780	5906220	stop glamorizing this. Your ears should not be perking up. You should be looking the other way
5906220	5909820	when you hear this. That's a lot of people that are saying this.
5910860	5914540	It's like, how about they focus on actually finishing a game properly instead of,
5914540	5923900	you know, getting NFTs involved? Questbuster says blockchain cash is a real thing too.
5923900	5927900	Governments are looking into digitizing their currency using the same technology. China is
5927900	5933020	already piloting a program for their own crypto. EU is looking at it and the Fed is also interested
5933020	5937180	to see what it can do. Wow. And Jason simply breaks it down. The whole reason people sell
5937180	5941900	is for money. Yeah. Everything else, anonymity, regulation, et cetera, is only incidentally extra.
5941900	5949420	The reason is thing has value to be extracted. Well, can't we, as people stand up and say,
5949420	5956300	NFT has no value. You can't, aren't we able to do that? You can. And that happens sometimes,
5956300	5961580	like people will buy into like some stupid thing because they think it's going to be worth a lot.
5961580	5965660	And then people, then they find out, Oh, I guess no one really wants to buy that. And then it's
5965660	5970860	worth nothing. It's all speculative. It's whatever you value, assign it. But people are
5971900	5978140	they're so hyped with this, like, what's the next big thing going to be? You know, it was Bitcoin
5978140	5982620	and Dogecoin and they're like, what's it going to be? And so everybody's getting like way too hyped
5982620	5986700	about every single new thing that's coming out. And that's the thing is they throw a lot of money
5986700	5990540	into it, hoping that's going to go up in value. And maybe it does, but a lot of the times it's
5990540	5996940	normally a person that creates the NFT or puts together the cryptocurrency and then they make
5996940	6002700	all the money and then leave with all the money. And then you're sitting there with something
6002700	6006940	useless. Why did they do that instead of just giving me all the money? That'd be easy.
6008060	6011740	Because they want all the money. No, I want it. It's mine.
6013580	6019340	They're not going to give it to you. Continuing on with the NFT stuff that I still don't understand.
6020060	6026620	The CEO of Discord had to backtrack a little bit. It looks like a screenshot kind of got out there.
6026860	6030380	Actually, I think he actually tweeted it out. It wasn't like a leaked or anything. He actually
6030380	6041260	tweeted it. Jason Citron, who is the founder and lead of Discord, tweeted a mock up on earlier this
6041260	6047340	week of a Discord interface showing crypto products like MetaMask, Wallet Connect and
6047340	6052940	Ethereum integrated within the Discord app. Also integrated with like YouTube, Twitch and all that
6053020	6058780	stuff. Needless to say, Discord fans threw a shit fit, I think is the technical term for it,
6059580	6066700	and it was quickly retracted, basically. So yeah, I love this. Probably nothing with a tweet,
6066700	6073740	a screenshot of that whole mock up. Although to be fair, maybe that's all it was. It was a mock up.
6073740	6078940	It was something to, you know, what if we wanted to get into this? What if we wanted to manage this
6078940	6084140	stuff? What might that look like? It may have been simply a how about this sort of thing.
6084140	6090300	But then boy, oh boy, boy, oh boy, that didn't do well. Oh, and I think there was an there was like
6090300	6094780	a survey that Discord put out that had NFT in it as well. So people connected the two together.
6096140	6101500	Anyway, in a follow up tweet, Citron said, thanks for all the perspectives. We have no current plans
6101500	6107260	to ship this internal concept. For now, we focused on protecting users from spam, scans and fraud.
6107340	6112140	Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale more soon.
6113340	6118540	In a statement in an interview with TechCrunch, he continued, we appreciate all the perspectives
6118540	6122220	we've been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet and want
6122220	6127340	to clarify from you. We have no plans to ship it at this time. We're excited about the potential
6127340	6131980	for Web3 technology and the positive way these communities are coming together on Discord,
6131980	6137100	especially those organized around environmentally friendly creator focused projects. However,
6137100	6141020	we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now, we're focused
6141020	6148780	on protecting users from spams, scans and fraud. So did it look to you again? I don't understand.
6149420	6155500	Did it look to you like Discord wanted to be like a central hub, a key ring, a place to store these
6155500	6160460	NFTs, a place to store like a wallet for your Ethereum and all this stuff? Is that what Discord
6160460	6164060	was kind of looking to be? Was kind of like what I guess PayPal does for some of that stuff?
6164060	6168460	Maybe, but that's not a really good point. I don't know if I'd trust them necessarily with
6168460	6178380	all that. Okay. Y'all just told me the whole point was to decentralize and have all this stuff off
6178380	6183740	the record. So why would I give it to Discord? Exactly. It links it to yourself. But then on top
6183740	6191260	of that, you know, they've had issues with people putting malware into like and sending out messages
6191260	6195980	to people and saying, hey, come test my game and stuff like that and exploiting their accounts.
6195980	6199180	And basically they're able to delete their accounts or have access to it. So yeah,
6199180	6204780	that's where I want all my crypto to be is in an easily exploitable account. Awesome.
6209260	6215420	NFTs will not have value until sex workers start accepting them. That is when you know something
6215420	6220940	has actual value is when the world's oldest profession will start accepting it. So until
6220940	6228380	that time, if a sex worker doesn't accept NFT in trade, they're not, they're not, they don't have
6228380	6232780	the value you think it does. That's like saying though, like, hey, I've got this fine painting
6232780	6239420	here. What can I get for that? I mean, like just because they don't accept it doesn't mean it's
6239420	6243500	not, doesn't have value. Now that said though, a lot of these don't have value. You'd be surprised
6243500	6248700	who you can take to a pawn shop. Can you take an NFT to a pawn shop? You can, you can take it,
6248700	6253500	you can take it and sell it and then you get a theorem and then you can use that to pay for
6253500	6262540	stuff. But, but yeah, it's typically people don't go, Hey, I got, I've got this JPEG of a weird
6262540	6270860	monkey. What can I get for that? Bobby says, I honestly think discord was just wanting to accept
6270860	6276460	crypto and there's, I can probably see that they wanted to link the wallet in the same way they
6276460	6279980	linked to your credit card for your nitro payments or the same way they linked to your
6279980	6286060	PayPal. Interesting. Zen monkey does point out, point out Pornhub does accept Bitcoin for
6286060	6292700	membership now. Well, that's fabulous. I definitely need to take a trip back to the olden days because
6292700	6298380	that is where I'm clearly living. So let us go to our next segment and cleanse the palette with this
6298380	6315100	little bumper here. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the
6315100	6321260	vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
6321260	6326140	I think a lot of you are going to love tonight's pick. What'd you pick tonight, DarkSakura?
6327020	6332140	I picked Mega Man Battle Network, also known as Rockman.exe.
6333820	6341100	It was developed in Capcom for the Game Boy Advance. It is the first title of the Rockman.exe
6341100	6349820	or Mega Man Battle Network games. It was released in Japan as a launch game on March 21st, 2021,
6349820	6354460	and then released later in the year in North America and Europe. It also is on the Wii U
6354460	6362620	Virtual Console. And it's a game I personally didn't get too much into, but a lot of people
6362620	6371500	love it. And so I figured I would talk about it. So it takes place during the 21st century,
6371500	6378300	which we're in. And everyone, basically everyone just lives on the internet.
6379820	6389820	You have these avatars called Netnavi, and you play a kid named Lan Hikari. I guess that's what
6389820	6400220	his name is. And his Netnavi, Mega Man.exe or Rockman.exe. And so he's got to solve crimes done
6400220	6407820	by the World 3 organization, WWW. So it is a little bit of a tactical role play game
6407820	6420140	where you control Lan or the avatar. And you have some battles that go in real time. You have
6420140	6425820	special abilities called battle chips that you fight off different viruses in the cyberspace.
6425900	6433500	And it also has like the battle chips or something like these folders, like card decks
6434300	6440620	that you can use for kind of like simulating a collectible card game, something like that.
6441180	6448620	But anyway, a lot of people are really, really into it. You can also do some other stuff in the
6448620	6453900	game, like some RPG-ish stuff. Like, you know, you hang out with NPCs, you can check your email,
6453980	6463900	buy stuff, do netmissions, speak to your little avatar there. You can also power up your little
6463900	6470700	avatar guy as he goes along. I mean, when he's out of health, game over, right? The thing about
6470700	6476700	this game is it was actually conceptualized as being a horror game. It was developed by Capcom
6476700	6488140	Production Studio 2 around the success of Pokemon. And then rather than it being a standard
6488140	6494140	action game, like they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, they wanted to do something like
6495100	6501820	what was happening in the Pokemon game to have this adventure with it, to add a real-world
6501820	6508460	element to Mega Man, to have a way for the player to connect with another player that's connecting
6508460	6519100	with the character. And then they also marketed it along with an anime adaptation so that, I mean,
6519100	6526060	it's all about money. In the end, you know, it's buy our game, watch our show, we're going to do
6526060	6537100	all this other stuff by that too. So when it was first announced in August of 2000, there was
6537100	6544380	a demo of the game that was promoted at Nintendo Space World. It was only available on two of the
6544380	6554220	140 playable consoles. They showed it off at Tokyo Game Show the next month. And the beta of it
6554220	6562460	had you fight a Woodman.exe. And so it had some different stuff going on with it. But the game
6562460	6569580	was fairly well received. It got an 80% on game rankings, 79 out of 100 on Metacritic.
6572220	6579500	Famitsu gave it a 30 of 40, which is good for Famitsu. And they said that it was really an
6579500	6587500	original kind of game playing off of the Mega Man franchise. So there you go, Battle Network
6587500	6595260	Rockman.exe, aka Mega Man Battle Network. All right, there's your classic giveaway. You know,
6595260	6601340	I have to admit, I never really got into or really played this series, but I know a lot of people
6602060	6607740	really, really love it. So it's one of those kind of gems that I guess I just unfortunately
6607740	6612140	passed over and never got around to, but would love to someday, especially. And I see in chat,
6612700	6618140	DJ Rama S is like, oh yes, I want a reboot of this. And yeah, I think that would be a good way
6618140	6622780	for a lot of people who maybe missed it the first time to get back on board. I guess you never know,
6622780	6630060	right? Yeah, you never can tell. Rama also says the anime is so good. And I trust Rama's
6630060	6637180	opinion on the anime with his own program here. For me, I just still prefer the classic
6637740	6642940	Rockman stuff, you know? But I know a lot of people who are into it and I would be remiss
6642940	6650780	if I didn't bring it up and it did come out 10 years ago. Yep. And as much as I would say that
6650780	6657340	too, like it's all about the main lines for me, I did love Legends. You know, I was always sad they
6657340	6662700	never did a third one, you know, but that's what it is. Quest Buster brings up something we were
6662700	6667500	talking about in a prior week. Like Sega, it was great seeing Capcom breakout creative
6667500	6674380	bursts like this that no one expected. So, all right. Never say never about Legends.
6674380	6679820	They get desperate enough for content they'll make. Never say never. That's true. All right.
6679820	6683980	Let's travel around the gaming world and check out some other quick headlines starting with Loki.
6685020	6690780	Yeah. So, this is a game that I keep, I kept trying to remember the name of like,
6690780	6697180	I've talked about this before. This was on the Brave Venture Musashi demo disc, I believe. And.
6698060	6705500	Back in the day. Yeah. Way back in the day. So, it is a game called Racing Lagoon and it came out
6705500	6713660	on the original PlayStation back in 1999. And it's now getting a, it's now playable in English,
6713660	6720140	thanks to fan translations. So, it's pretty cool. It's like a racing RPG, kind of like a
6720140	6725740	drift racing RPG type thing. So. I vaguely remember hearing about something like this.
6725740	6730700	I think they just had, I don't remember if they had like a playable, like actual demo for it,
6730700	6737020	but it was, I think it may have been just a trailer, but I've ever seen that. I was like,
6737020	6740620	oh man, that looks cool. And then it just like never came out in the United States. So.
6741980	6749500	Oh, well. Neat. And then, yeah. New DDR. It's pretty exciting. So, DDR Grand Prix. This was,
6750620	6757980	the PC game that we kind of did the test for not that long ago. And it's got a bunch of new songs,
6757980	6764220	plus a bunch of older songs as well. It's going to require a subscription service to play it online.
6764220	6767740	And I think they're going to also have a controller as well, but you can play with
6767740	6776220	basically any USB controller that is offered out there. I fully anticipate playing this on my
6776220	6782140	cabinet as soon as the songs get leaked and then put on to StepMania, which will probably happen
6782700	6788220	very quickly. Clever. Especially with all the assets being able to be ripped from a PC game.
6788220	6792860	I mean, it's like, that'll be just a matter of time. It's also funny to kind of just sit back
6792860	6796700	and reflect on how far we've come. You know, in the early days of Orange Launch Radio,
6796700	6802620	we were talking about the literal Dance Dance Revolution PC game release with its infamous
6802620	6808780	downloadable characters. Mr. Spanky. That's where that whole character came from. Yes,
6808780	6813500	they literally released a character called Mr. Spanky, who just looked like, you know,
6813500	6820220	they were dressed up in bondage here. Somebody else. It was like two bondage, you know,
6820220	6825740	kings and queens that were released together in this whole thing. And now here we are talking
6825740	6831100	about DDR PC again, but it's a subscription service. It's just, it's interesting. Not that
6831100	6836540	I'm not going to get it, but, um, yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to see it, check it out.
6836540	6841100	It's just, I feel like I haven't really touched DDR in a while. I'm still waiting for that round
6841100	6847100	one to open up out here, but you know, the movie theater. Yeah. Yeah. I was just going to say,
6847100	6854540	uh, Alan, funny to out of the blue today, I saw our pal JD, um, was in town cause it turned out
6854540	6859100	the only place he could get a booster shot was up here. Long story. Oh, I missed him.
6859660	6864460	He was literally like, we took him to the thing and back to the train basically. So,
6865100	6871100	uh, for like two seconds. Yeah. Um, so, um, Oh, what was I gonna say with all that though? Um,
6872700	6877020	Oh, we got, we brought up the topic of round one cause it came up in the car
6877020	6882540	and Alan looked into it and was like, well, that movie theater opened up on Thursday and I was
6882540	6888300	like, Oh shit. Okay. So the movie theater malls open now and the round one stuff is now on the
6888300	6893340	city of Roseville's website. It just, they published a story on like Tuesday, the whole
6893340	6900140	thing, like round one coming soon. So I, I wonder, I wonder if they're going to try to
6900140	6903900	get it open by black Friday when there's going to be all that traffic through the mall. I would be
6906220	6909180	22 on there now. So we were just there last weekend.
6911420	6917420	You know, and I was, I think it'd be a while. I was thinking that probably those machines
6918300	6922780	are, but if they, if they hadn't already purchased them and had them in storage over here
6922780	6928300	before the pandemic, those machines are probably on a ship somewhere in the middle of the ocean
6928300	6936780	right now. And that's probably what's holding it back, but we'll see. Let's see. Um, Oh, that's
6936780	6942060	neat. Uh, did your MS says the first opening theme to the anime jam session podcast was from
6942140	6948780	the rock man, exe, mega man, battle network anime. That's really cool. Um, yeah. All right. Um,
6949580	6954780	dark to see you said they deleted holic. You can never delete holic. Absolutely not. Uh,
6954780	6960060	dark to see me. I played the free version of grand Prix. I'm sorely tempted to subscribe
6960060	6964540	since you get a good chunk of songs, including a 20 plus stuff. Orange ride also played this
6964540	6968620	week. Didn't subscribe, but they allowed you to play it with tickets. Yes. Pay for play,
6968620	6975660	bringing the arcade experience home, uh, being able to pay just a dollar. So neato. All right.
6977180	6980140	Yeah. All right. Uh, dark soccer, what do you have for rapid fire news?
6981500	6988940	Um, so if you have a Nintendo switch, you can watch Twitch on switch. It is in the e-shop and
6988940	6995740	for free, and you can watch your favorite streamers through the Twitch app. So cool.
6996300	7002780	I still prefer to watch on my, uh, on my computer. Yeah. It's uh, and it's also,
7002780	7008860	in my opinion, not as good as the X-Box or PlayStation experience because you can't have
7008860	7016780	chat and the video up at the same time, unless you're using a mobile phone to like have chat,
7016780	7021740	which the app actually encourages you to do. For whatever reason, it can't run those by
7021900	7026220	side by side. Bobby had an interesting ridiculous. Bobby had a thing on his show tonight where he's
7026220	7032540	like, it's tapping into the video feed directly. And just displaying that, like almost like you're
7032540	7036940	watching a YouTube or something. So I don't know. It's, it's very clearly some weird technical
7036940	7044140	limitation of the switch. Um, so, but I will say, so I list all these negatives, but the switch has
7044140	7049500	a very nice screen. I would rather watch on my switch screen than I would my mobile phone.
7049500	7055020	Cause it's a little bit bigger and it's very nice looking. Um, so there, there is that just be
7055020	7061340	prepared. You can't really see chat, uh, unless the streamer is projecting chat on top of their
7061340	7068540	image, which some do some don't. So yeah. Anyway, it's like, Oh, use the phone and this app. I mean,
7068540	7074780	I guess if you're doing it on TV or something, that's fine, but. Which is kind of what I do.
7074780	7078540	It's it's too slow to type on X-Box. Yeah. But if it's on the handheld,
7078540	7081420	like if I'm watching a handheld, it's like, well, I'm just watching my phone.
7081420	7086380	Yeah. I'm with, with Mike Daft and Pod Culture who are both echoing that the OLED probably makes
7086380	7090780	a great case. I don't even have an OLED and I think it looks good on the switch screen. So
7090780	7099500	there is that anyway, what else do you have? Um, so the publisher for, uh, call of duty, um,
7100460	7110300	had to put out a change to it because, um, there were torn pages of the Quran, uh, scattered
7110300	7114860	in the game. Some of them, uh, scattered on the ground and with blood on them,
7115500	7122140	which of course angered many Muslims, uh, because it is a sacred text and to them the literal word
7122140	7130300	of God. And they call it Islamophobic. So, um, they actually posted, uh, uh, the, from the, uh,
7130300	7137020	call of duty, Middle East, uh, account in Arabic stating that they removed the scenes from the game
7137020	7142940	apologizing for the offense caused. And of course, this is a game that came out November 5th.
7143820	7148780	I'll read the translation. The game call of duty was designed for all users, the scenes in the game,
7148780	7153820	which were offensive to Muslims were, uh, which were shown last week have now been removed.
7153820	7158300	They should not have been included in the game. We apologize profusely. We're taking all measures to
7158300	7162060	address this issue within the company in order to understand what happened and ensure it does
7162060	7168300	not happen again. It's like our sex abuse scandals. Uh, as Joe and Matt says, come on,
7168300	7172060	someone missed some common sense there. Yeah. It seems to be a thing that's missing in gaming
7172060	7181420	lately. All right. Um, I, I think they've already done their damage, so yep. All righty.
7181420	7185740	Let's travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases. I know we're in the height of
7185740	7191660	November and I think we got some big stuff this week, right? Logie. Yeah, we got, we got stuff.
7191660	7200540	That's for sure. Um, so starting things off, uh, we've got, looks like grow the song of ever tree
7200540	7206620	on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, hex tech mayhem, a league in the
7206620	7213500	league of legends story on PC and Nintendo switch. That's a rhythm game and Sherlock
7213500	7219980	Holmes chapter one on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series X surviving the aftermath on
7219980	7228220	Nintendo switch, the waylanders on PC, final fantasy seven, the first soldier on iOS and
7228220	7234620	Android. Uh, we've got clang two on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
7234620	7243260	Xbox one and Xbox series X kid amnesia exhibition on PC, Mac and PlayStation five,
7244460	7252060	Microsoft flight simulator game of the year edition on PC and Xbox series X battlefield
7252060	7260380	2042 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X. And of course,
7260380	7268540	last but not least, uh, we have Pokemon, um, brilliant diamond and Shane Pearl on Nintendo
7268540	7274860	switch. And I'm just shocked that they put that in one game. It didn't try to sell it as two.
7275420	7277900	No, it's being sold as two. It's just also in a combo pack.
7278700	7286940	Oh, nevermind. All right. Uh, traveling to Japan, uh, obviously Pokemon, brilliant diamond and
7286940	7292060	shining Pearl. Uh, those two games are the big, big release in Japan on the switch this week.
7292060	7295900	There's not a lot going up against it, but there are a couple of alternative games you can check
7295900	7301660	out on the 18th. There's a game called the illmatic envelope swamp and Raiders re swag.
7301660	7306380	That is a game that's coming out on the switch. And then there's another game called knives out
7306380	7311580	game rhythm pack. And I was like, Oh, is it a rhythm game? It certainly doesn't look like it.
7311580	7316860	In fact, when I look at the box art, it kind of looks like, like it's squid game type characters.
7316860	7322860	And I'm like, how did they do that so fucking fast? But it's a, it's a Sega published title,
7322860	7328300	which is also interesting. And, uh, it's five players in a group, a hundred players in a battle.
7328300	7332620	You work with teammates to live to the end, trust your teammates and win together with guns in hand.
7333180	7340380	So it, it really sounds like, I don't know. It's, it's just interesting that that is so fast,
7340380	7345740	but okay. Um, let's see also, uh, that, that is all on the switch, but let's not leave out
7345740	7352540	PlayStation, uh, five PlayStation five has its own release of battlefield 2042 is out in Japan this
7352540	7357820	week. And, uh, that is it. Yeah. Farming simulator to look forward next week, but that is it for the
7357820	7365420	PS five. Let's go over to the UK dark soccer. On the 16th, we have surviving the aftermath
7366060	7373740	for the big three, um, angry alligator for switch on the 18th on the 19th battlefield 2042
7374380	7379580	for Xbox PlayStation, Pokemon brilliant diamond and shining Pearl double pack for switch,
7380220	7388540	including their, uh, individual releases as well, uh, Zenith for, uh, the 19th also on switch
7388540	7398380	and also distrust on switch. Um, we have disco Elysium, the final cut for Xbox and PlayStation
7399100	7405740	arc ultimate survivor edition for the same two, again, on the 19th train some world to rush hour
7405740	7413580	deluxe edition on just PlayStation. Uh, we have the eternal cylinder. Uh, we also have
7413580	7419980	our ultimate survivor edition. Didn't I just say that one? Yeah, they repeated it. Nevermind.
7419980	7425100	Oh, it looks like it's actually got a lower, um, a lower ranking, a lower age limit on it.
7425980	7431500	Maybe there's two versions. Oh, that could be. And that that's going to be it for this week.
7432460	7439500	All right. Uh, actually it reminds me, I've got to, uh, get my copy of, uh, diamond or Pearl
7439500	7443500	preloaded. I haven't decided which one I want to get. I didn't sit down and look at the differences
7443500	7448060	and try to remember. Cause I don't remember like which Pokemon are in which version. So, uh,
7448060	7452700	we'll see. All right. Anyhow, uh, we have a few more stories for you guys and then we'll see if
7452700	7456460	we have any time. Well, yeah, we should have time for at least one call. If anyone wants to call us
7456460	7461020	over at, uh, our discord server, uh, which you can continue the conversation throughout the week.
7461100	7467180	It's not just for our live calls, vog network.com. That's VOG network.com slash discord. If you want
7467180	7472140	to join and the green room is where you want to be waiting. Uh, if you'd like to call in,
7472140	7476380	but we do have a few, so it's going to be about 15, 20 minutes because we still have a few stories
7476380	7481500	to get to first. Uh, Mike deaf says I can get you the list. Yeah. I know it's on self road. I'm just
7481500	7487180	lazy. Uh, and also the knives out game I mentioned earlier, nothing to do with the movie. Yeah. I
7487180	7491660	had that same kind of like, is this the movie, but why would that be in Japan first? It's nothing
7491660	7499260	to do the movie. Okay. Um, Loki, uh, I think this is kind of funny. Yeah. So, Hey, if you have a lot
7499260	7505420	of money that you want to burn on absolute garbage, um, Gucci is going to start selling
7505420	7515100	some Xbox series X, um, controllers, I guess for $10,000. Um, or no, I'm sorry, an actual console.
7515100	7523660	So it's going to be a customized Xbox series X plus two controllers for $10,000. And they come
7523660	7528620	in map. I guess the controllers are a matte black with like a red and blue stripe on it.
7530460	7534460	Because if you want to talk about speculative value, there you go. Um,
7535500	7541900	alternatively, you could also just not do that and buy an Xbox series X normally, and then customize
7541900	7548860	your own controller through the Xbox design lab, which has now added 19 new colors and
7548860	7553580	rubberized grips. So you can actually make your own controller and it costs much less than $10,000,
7554460	7559100	only $70 and 10 more. If you want to actually add those rubberized grip,
7560860	7565020	I don't understand people that buy this stuff. I guess people that are by this stuff, you know,
7565020	7574140	$10,000 for them is just pocket change. So why not? Just, just, just drop in the bucket. Those,
7574140	7578380	those money that are making, uh, all that money scalping PS fives, we'll be able to afford the
7578380	7585020	Gucci, uh, Xbox. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Uh, and did tiger claw brings up the same thing I thought of
7585020	7589820	honestly saying that's funny considering there's that house of Gucci that's coming out. Well,
7589820	7595660	you know, the Gucci company is, is still very much everywhere in your local mall with, uh,
7595660	7601820	uh, people lined up outside it to get in. Who does Gucci anymore? It's all Hermes.
7603500	7610540	So I'm just saying they're still, uh, Versace or as I always like to say in my best show girls
7610540	7615660	versus right. Uh, Versace, same thing. And they had that whole show about, you know,
7615660	7621500	the really unfortunate killing of, uh, uh, the, the, the guy has started that whole thing. Um,
7621500	7625820	and like Ricky Martin was in that and all that, right? The, the, it was the American crime story
7625820	7630380	or whatever. Is that it? Was that what it, the Versace that was all on TV and they made a media
7630380	7637180	spectacle out of that, uh, while this company is still running. So it's, um, but it is it tiger
7637180	7644140	claw. I have to admit, I thought like, is this like a weird ass tie in the movie, but I don't,
7644220	7648460	I don't know why it would be. I also don't need it because I think the movie has to do with like
7649260	7657020	murder and stuff that I don't know if Gucci necessarily, um, yeah, but also, um,
7658700	7662620	Crap. I was gonna, I was gonna say something else, but I know a lot of other,
7662620	7668220	the designer companies like to work with tech companies to do like, well, and Gucci also
7668220	7675260	worked with a Fiat for a Gucci edition, uh, uh, Abarth or however they're pronounced.
7675900	7684220	Um, cause I kind of wanted one. Um, and I mean, Hermes has the deal with Apple for Apple watches
7684940	7688940	and it's designers do this all the time. So
7688940	7698300	anyway. All right. Sorry. I'm, I'm, I'm texting Shane because the earlier question that came up
7698300	7704540	about, uh, Pokemon, I would just text to Shane. I said, do I get diamond or Pearl? And he just
7704540	7709260	replied with a P he just replied. I don't know if I probably, he just replied with the picture
7709260	7714140	that shows all the differences between the two. Like he didn't even, he just replied with the
7714140	7718540	picture that Mike Deft was probably about to send me. And so I'm looking at it and I'm like, okay,
7718540	7722780	I think I want diamond. So I replied to him and I said, I think I'm going to get diamond,
7722780	7728460	but I really want a Vulpix, which is in Pearl. He says, what makes diamond Pearl before?
7728460	7731820	Yeah. And he's like, what makes diamond more appealing? And I'm like, literally everything
7731820	7736860	else. I'm like, I, a lot of the trade for a Vulpix. Yeah, I can trade for a Vulpix. And I'm
7736860	7742380	like looking at the rest. I'm like, I prefer Electabuzz to Magmar. Uh, I like Scyther, uh,
7742380	7748300	versus Pincer, especially. I like that, that thing that evolves into Cranados, I think is the name.
7748860	7753740	I don't really care for the, uh, other one on the other side. Seal is cute. I can't, I,
7753740	7759180	I really don't like the Slow Bros and they're all in the other one. Uh, Miles is cute. Yeah. It's,
7759180	7764300	and Tyranitar, which is, you know, I love that whole line too. Uh, and then it has the dogs
7764300	7768700	versus the bird. Yeah. I'm like everything in diamond. I kind of like better. Um, so there
7768700	7773500	you go. I guess I'm going to get diamond. All right. Oh, that's. I'm just going to go listen
7773500	7780620	to Prince. And if you don't get it, you're a kid. Oh yeah. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Um,
7780620	7785180	let's get into the next story, which is another Twitch story, funny enough, but very different
7785180	7789100	from what we were talking about before. Uh, you know, Twitch does a lot, not just with gaming,
7789100	7793580	but there's a lot of music creation and content that's going on there. And Twitch is going to be
7793580	7799900	targeting musicians, uh, with a new program. It's called the collective and it's going to invite
7799900	7805100	selected musicians. It's an invite only collective. Uh, and from there you get more
7805100	7809100	information on how do you build communities? How do you earn money through fans on the streaming
7809100	7815900	platform? Um, this was all announced on Twitter by the head of music and V VP, uh, who is Tracy P
7815900	7820540	Chan on Twitter and, uh, talked a little more about it, how they're planning to support and
7820540	7826140	so forth. What I think is interesting about this is that they actually have, um, partners with
7826140	7830460	rolling stone and Amazon music and those types of partnerships can be huge in getting discovered.
7830460	7835900	I'm sure, especially rolling stone. Uh, so once you're a musician, you graduate from this program,
7835900	7840860	you get eligible for prioritize discovery, promotion and activations from Twitch.
7840860	7845020	So that's interesting. I'll be curious if any musician friends, I'm sure there's stuff in
7845020	7848700	there that has to be kept secret, which is why they're not really detailing what really is in
7848700	7853900	the collective. Um, so it'll be interesting to see, uh, friends that I know that are getting
7853900	7859340	involved with that, uh, and what that all entails and how that goes. But, you know, it's just
7859340	7866860	very telling of the, the digital path forward, uh, our society is taking. So, all right.
7868140	7872380	Interesting bonds, double six and chat. I'm just seeing this about the Gucci thing.
7872380	7877180	I have done internships for house of Gucci for eight months. They're all right. I got a $100
7877180	7882460	belt as a present. Love it. If I paid a hundred dollars for a fucking belt, I'd love it too.
7882620	7888620	Um, um, Alan has always told me he wants a Burberry coat and, you know, do you know how
7888620	7895020	much those fucking coats are from Burberry? That is, is I would have to, I would have to mortgage
7895020	7899740	someone's house to pay for, you know, they're, they're not cheap. It's yeah. So, or at least
7899740	7904060	I said, maybe I'll get you a scarf. That's a couple hundred dollars that I could save up
7904060	7908300	the money and get you one of those, but that's like your big Christmas present for the year.
7908380	7916060	It's a scarf. So we'll see. All right. Um, I was going to go to our next story, but it looks like,
7916060	7921020	uh, dark soccer. Oh, hi. All right. Uh, then I just went to go put my bowl in the sink.
7921020	7924140	Oh, no worries. Then why don't we go to our next story? If you're ready.
7924860	7932300	All right. So, um, I'm sure people remember that when, um, mass effect legendary edition came out,
7932300	7938140	they couldn't do the pinnacle, uh, deals, the pinnacle station DLC, because the code was,
7938140	7946300	was gone. In fact, when they got, um, the information, the, uh, the backups from a Demiurge
7946300	7952620	who, uh, did the DLC for them, it was super corrupted vital links for missing. They couldn't
7952620	7965020	do anything with it, but thanks to mods. The DLC is back. Um, it is updated, um, graphically
7965580	7974540	with difficulty adjusted extra music and sound effects and the old, uh, kind of 2009 ishness,
7974540	7985180	uh, polished out of it. Um, they actually had a blog post for how they managed to get it done.
7986140	7993020	And I'm, I'm absolutely, absolutely impressed that, that they could do it. I mean,
7994700	8001020	they, they even put in like some of their, uh, some of the coding, uh, differences, uh,
8001660	8007820	where, how they rebuilt those particular pathways to get it done. Um, I thought it was absolutely,
8008780	8013420	absolutely a labor of love and I thought it was, was pretty good. You, um, you can actually get
8013420	8020940	it from nexus mods and I will, uh, post the link in chat. Um, everyone else is just going to have
8020940	8028460	to go look for it, but there you go. You can now play pinnacle station again. Here we go again with
8028460	8036300	the modders saving the day, although, you know, again, let's DMC strike them now. The reason why
8036300	8041020	Bioware admitted it or omitted it in the first place, they didn't do it for any sort of greedy
8041020	8044860	or lazy reason. I get it. They didn't have the source code, you know, it was a different issue,
8044860	8051180	but it's, it's fascinating that again, modders just recreated it touch for touch. So there you
8051180	8062460	go. It's all for love. Yep. Sure is. All right. Moving on Loki. Yep. So, um, battlefield 2042,
8062460	8066460	which is one of the games that's coming out this week, it's having some issues with the early
8066460	8071580	access. Maybe you may remember EA has this wonderful program to where you can actually
8071580	8080060	play EA games early and you pay a premium for that. And well, it is, um, jank right now.
8080620	8086860	I've seen reviews talking about the game saying that, you know, there's all sorts of frame rate
8086860	8092380	issues depending on the maps that you're on, which is weird. Um, it just plays weird sometimes.
8093180	8100540	So they're saying that right now that even Xbox consoles are being crashed by this game,
8100540	8106940	including the series X, um, just stops working after a while and it'll reset itself.
8107580	8113820	So that's not good. Hopefully it's something that they're going to, uh, address also in
8113820	8117500	order to actually be able to play this early access, you had to get one of those bundles
8117500	8122780	as well. So it's, you know, upwards of $120 that you paid to play this game early. You paid to be
8122780	8131180	a beta tester. So enjoy. Yeah, it's unfortunate, but this is a state that a lot of these games
8131180	8139100	come out nowadays. EA is really bad at this. It's just, it's just another, they say just
8139100	8143580	add it to the list games that shouldn't have come out yet. Pre-order games. Boy. Oh boy.
8144380	8149020	All right. Well, trying to end on a positive note with a game from a smaller studio
8149740	8154540	that is about cats, how could I not end with a cat story tonight? Right. Let's make ourselves
8154540	8160220	feel better after all of these, uh, not great, you know, broken game releases. Let's talk about
8160220	8166860	Double Dagger Studio in Seattle and their upcoming game Little Kitty Big City. And it's
8166860	8173660	going to be coming out in 2022. Uh, it's consoles and PC, although they did not say which consoles.
8173660	8180540	Uh, the, uh, overview is you are a little kitty lost in the big city. Will you find your way home
8180540	8185420	or are you having too much fun along the way? Little Kitty Big City is a game where you play
8185420	8190860	a curious little kitty with a big personality on an adventure to find your way back home,
8190860	8198060	explore the city, make new friends, wear delightful hats. I always love it when that's
8198060	8204140	a selling point for a game and leave more than a little chaos in your wake. After all, isn't that
8204140	8209180	what cats can do best? And they released a trailer for it, which I'm sorry. I didn't render in time
8209180	8216540	to actually so show on stream tonight, but it just, I, it looks somewhere around like, um,
8217820	8223100	the untitled goose game a little bit, but with the cat just kind of walking around and getting
8223100	8230460	into trouble and talking to dogs and wearing hats and climbing up things and smashing pots and
8230460	8235820	doing all the things that you would expect cats to do. So I'm all about this. Uh, yeah,
8235900	8240140	Mike Deft made the same conclusion. It's goose game, but with a cat titled cat game.
8241580	8247740	I like it. Uh, Zen Monkey 11 says, yeah, I'd play the shit out of that cat game. Sounds great. Yes.
8247740	8253820	Quest Buster says cat with hat cat in the hat, I guess. All right, there you go. Little Kitty Big
8253820	8263740	City. Looking forward to that in 2022 and not much else at this point. All right, let's, let's go to
8263740	8272540	the listener round table, um, with your emails, your discord calls, uh, over at vog network.com
8272540	8276860	slash discord, uh, and any chat questions you guys have, if you have any questions for us in chat,
8276860	8281020	go ahead and put them in there. Uh, first we'll take a trip to the mailbag participate
8281020	8285900	at orange lounge, radio.com. And we'll see if we have any emails for the readings tonight,
8285900	8294780	our Sakura who is muted and frantically looking for the button. There we go.
8294780	8299500	I wasn't frantic on anything. Well, I have to fill this time with something. All right, go ahead.
8300780	8306060	Hello, LR. I just wanted to formally invite the awesome audience of LR to my DDR charity stream
8306060	8312060	next Saturday, November 21st at 1 PM Eastern. I'll be attempting to clear max 342 times with
8312060	8318220	at least 21 of those being on expert difficulty is the Ohio DDR max 300 birthday challenge.
8318220	8321980	I got through it last year, but, and I don't intend to lose this time either,
8321980	8325740	but that's not all my buddy, Dan hood, who I've been playing and practicing
8326460	8330460	with over the last few years will also be attempting the challenge along with me.
8330460	8336700	He's got to get through it 30 times, but is bursting with confidence and ready to go.
8336700	8341660	It'll be a good four hours of stomping reminiscing about the old days of DDR and ITG
8341660	8347580	and general shenanigans we were doing. We're doing this to benefit feeding America.
8347580	8352220	Hunger remains a major problem across our nation, affecting millions of Americans.
8352220	8356940	If you, if you're financially able to do so, please help us raise some money for a great cause
8356940	8360060	would really appreciate your support. And if you want to go to my event page,
8360060	8368140	I've made it really easy. You just go to tiny URL.com slash 2021 max 300. And you're there.
8368700	8373020	Thanks so much for checking us out. We'll probably be using step mania for this,
8373020	8376380	but just yesterday I learned about dance dance revolution, grand Prix, the brand new,
8376380	8380700	just released official home version for windows. And I think if I can get it set up in time,
8380700	8386700	we'll use that instead. I'm not sure if it may show role, but if not, here's a bit of info about
8386700	8391340	it. The good news is that there's finally a, uh, a new home version of DDR for all of these.
8391340	8396140	We talked about this, I think a few weeks ago, um, even better. It has the same interface tonight.
8396140	8401260	Yeah. Loki talked about it earlier, but yeah. Hmm. I could swear that we mentioned something
8401260	8406380	about this before. I'm sure we've mentioned it before. Yes. The beta test came up before,
8406380	8411180	and now it was the official release. Yeah. Okay. Even better. It has the same interface
8411180	8415740	and almost the entire song list of current arcade version minus just a few licenses and covers.
8415740	8421180	That's all 900 songs in total given take give or take, and it will work with any dance pad set up.
8421180	8426300	The bad news is that the cost and accessibility are similar to other current Konami PC releases,
8426300	8431260	meaning you need a Japanese account to get it. There are subscription fees and there are pay per
8431260	8436300	play fees on top of that, depending on what modes you want to access to summarize, you can play
8436300	8442940	without a subscription of the equivalent of 110 yen per three songs set, uh, the songs features
8442940	8447340	and options are available are roughly equivalent to what you would get if you walked up to the
8447340	8453500	arcade machine and played it without logging in, but you would lose out on the newest, uh,
8455020	8460780	unlockable songs, plus, uh, several options and features that are unavailable in the arcade,
8460780	8465580	unless you log in, such as the ability to save your scores. If you choose to subscribe for about
8465580	8470060	15 bucks a month, you get access to those features, but you still have to pay for each game on top of
8470060	8475020	that. However, fully included in a subscription is the additional unlimited play mode that gives
8475020	8479260	you access to everything in the song list up to DDR supernova two. And it doesn't cost anything
8479260	8486700	per game to play that well, apart from the subscription itself, excuse me. Um, so in other
8486700	8491660	words, yes, it costs a lot, but you can base it, but it is basically the entire arcade game and
8491660	8496780	it's a hundred percent legal. So you can stream it without repercussions and just about all of
8496780	8502380	the music in the game. What I said, wow. And just about all of the music.
8503260	8506300	Yeah. I don't know about that. I would be careful just now.
8507340	8511100	And just about all of the music in the game is fully owned by Konami. So copyright strikes
8511100	8517100	are probably unlikely to happen. So for those folks who have great setups at home and are able
8517100	8521980	to afford the steep pricing, it might be worth it to try. If you want to look in to it further,
8521980	8528380	ddrcommunity.com has excellent guides. Thanks again for the show and for Signal Boost. I hope
8528380	8534780	that you will be able to join us at 1 PM Eastern next Sunday afternoon at tinyurl slash 2021 max
8534780	8540540	300 sweaty hugs, Aaron, Y Y R sweaty hugs. I like that. Yeah. It's going to be 10 AM our time.
8540540	8544700	That'll be right around the time I'm getting up. Uh, yeah, yeah. That's probably, we'll still be
8544700	8550540	in bed, but I I'll check it out for sure. Yeah. Um, I have to make a reminder on my calendar or
8550540	8555260	I'll forget, but, um, best of luck with that. I love that. I like that you're making it a charity
8555260	8561340	event out of that. Uh, and good luck with that. So that's, that's great. I would say break a leg,
8561340	8566620	but I feel like for this, I really shouldn't actually say that. So, um, don't break a leg.
8567340	8573180	All right. Um, if that's it for emails, I will encourage folks to send more participate
8573180	8579340	at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send emails. Uh, let me check the discord room over
8579340	8584940	time. Nope. Nobody's in there yet. Uh, and then in chat, uh, just some folks commenting on the,
8584940	8591180	uh, DDR, uh, uh, grant grand PRI breakdown, uh, bonds, double six saying paywall everywhere
8591180	8595980	and orange, right. Saying grand PRI is expensive. Yeah. Um, but it is interesting. You're kind of
8595980	8600940	getting an arcade perfect version where essentially, as far as we know, pretty much legally, I mean,
8600940	8605420	we don't know what weird third parties might try to claim, but I think a lot of those songs are
8605420	8611180	done in house or, or created by Konami. So, uh, he said they, they carved out the license stuff
8611180	8615820	for the most part. So I would hope so. I just, I, I'm always worried about that stuff. Yeah,
8615820	8619500	I understand. I get it. I get it. So, but if they're going to be kind of like talking while
8619500	8624780	they're going through it too, that'll help a lot too. So, all right. Uh, Jason is suggesting,
8624780	8629660	uh, the well wish I could send is don't fall off. All right. There you go. Don't fall off while
8629660	8635260	you're with your birthday fundraiser. All right. Well, I think with that, then we'll go ahead and
8635260	8639740	wrap up another edition of OLR. I want to thank you guys for downloading our show this week or
8639740	8643660	listening to us live, however you participated with our show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
8643660	8647980	Appreciate you guys. Uh, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word
8647980	8652860	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to put out on
8652860	8659020	air. Um, so, uh, please, uh, tell a friend or two about the show. Um, spread the word,
8659020	8663260	get them here in chat, participate with the show. It would really mean the world. Um,
8664620	8669820	and, uh, if you feel so inclined, you'll notice I'm wearing a VOG branded shirt and that's available,
8669820	8675100	uh, at the shop, vognetwork.com slash shop. If you want to check that out, uh, you don't have to,
8675100	8681900	but if you feel so inclined, uh, appreciate that. Um, a nice social media tweet, a five-star review
8681900	8686460	where you found this podcast, all of it goes a long way. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate
8686460	8691900	the support. Let's go around and get folks final thought. I should wait before I do the final
8691900	8696860	thoughts. Let me address this because I see Tiger Claw in chat says, you know, G4 TV's relaunches
8696860	8704700	this Tuesday, November 16th. I don't think on principle, we should just give that a news
8704700	8710620	headline. Like when they do something newsworthy, we'll talk about it. Um, but I'm kind of
8711820	8715820	expect, I'm going to be honest and maybe I will be proved wrong.
8716940	8722700	I just kind of expect a lot of sophomore crap. That was what G4 was at the end of its run.
8722700	8731340	And the reality is G4 has to be competitive now with Twitch and, uh, other ways that people
8731340	8736460	consume content and gamer related content in this day and age. I wish them well. I know people
8736460	8743740	that are involved. Good luck, but I, and it's, it's none of those people I'm concerned about.
8745020	8749340	It's people at the top. If there's been one, if there's been one message tonight,
8750700	8759260	executives ruin everything. There it is. All right. Anyway. Um, let's, uh, get everybody's
8759260	8763740	final, final thought. Dark soccer, your final, I appreciate you bringing up the comment though.
8763740	8767260	I just wanted to explain why we haven't really talked more about it. Um,
8769500	8773100	Oh, the G4 thing. Not, not you drag. I was sorry. The G4 thing. I appreciate you bringing it up. I
8773100	8776540	just want to address why we haven't talked more about it. I just, I don't see why we should.
8776540	8782460	All right. Dark soccer. Uh, your final thought. Um, I'll go ahead and open up on this one. Um,
8782460	8792780	I am being tested for narcolepsy, which is, uh, a test by omission. So, um, wish me luck.
8794620	8799900	Is that this week or no, cause you know, um, what I'll say, so I'll just, I'll give the details.
8799900	8804700	So the weaning off of my medication is because the medications that I'm on right now are actually
8804700	8811100	used to treat narcolepsy. They have to take me off of my antidepressants and my sleeping meds
8811100	8815500	and a couple of other things, which I may have to quit cold Turkey to get it out of my system.
8815500	8820220	I've actually started weaning myself until they give me my date. And then two weeks
8820860	8826940	before my sleep lab, I stopped taking them whether I'm weaned off or not. Um,
8827660	8833100	and then I do my sleep lab and then a week after that, I should hopefully be back on my meds and
8833100	8841500	back to okay. But I am not a very good person to be around when I am not on my meds. I am on them
8841500	8847900	for a very important reason. So, um, when that goes down, I am going to make an announcement.
8847900	8857020	I am off my meds. And if I snap at you, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. So there you go. Blanket message.
8857980	8864620	All right. Um, all right. Uh, well have a good, I'm assuming you're streaming as usual after
8864620	8869660	the show tonight. So have a good stream. All right. Yep. Have fun. All right. Bye.
8869660	8872300	And we'll go to Loki with your final thought tonight.
8873180	8878940	Uh, my final thought is I have a lot of work to do on my episode.
8880060	8884220	Well, yeah, good luck. That'll be coming out soon. It's a really cool build. It's fun. It's
8884220	8888300	all farms. And then it's also Hermitcraft themed. I've really got to get away from that,
8888300	8893980	but it's fun. I had an idea for a pun at the beginning of the season and so I finally got
8893980	8902220	around to it. All right. Uh, and my final thought is, um, it's been a crazy last two weeks. I'm kind
8902220	8906540	of glad that I have some stuff sort of out there in the open now. Um, and I'm not just kind of
8906540	8910860	stewing on it. And, uh, thanks again, everybody for being very lovely about it. And it's nice
8910860	8917740	to know that I'm not alone. Um, the future will be bright. I have spoken it into existence.
8918780	8923740	It will happen. Uh, there is, there is nothing you can do about it. The future will be bright.
8924380	8929340	That's going to do it. Have a great, have a bright seven days and, uh, enjoy all the games coming
8929340	8934460	out. Pokemon fans, enjoy those remakes. Battlefield, whatever else you're into,
8934460	8939180	enjoy all that other good stuff that's coming out this week. Have a wonderful, wonderful time,
8939180	8944860	and we'll see you back here in seven days to do it all again as black Friday, Thanksgiving,
8944860	8948540	and the real, I mean, I know people are breaking out the Mariah Carey already,
8948540	8953100	but the real holiday season really starts getting into full swing. Have a wonderful week,
8953100	8955420	everybody. We'll see you next time here at orange lounge radio. Good night.
