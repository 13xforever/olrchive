0	14280	It's another week in a very wild gaming world with all manner of continuing stories,
14280	17640	new rumors, new deals, old new deals, and plenty more.
17640	18760	My favorite headline?
18760	22440	Sony teasing that they're not out of the mobile space yet, but they are back in the
22440	24240	position of having to play catch up.
24240	27160	We hope the holiday was great for those who celebrate, and for those who didn't, we
27160	28440	hope the sales were helpful.
28440	30760	But they're over yet, of course.
30760	34200	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki with this week's gaming
34200	37520	news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37520	46840	Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every
46840	48400	gamer has a voice.
48400	54920	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 893 of our
54920	58760	show for this November the 28th of 2021.
58760	64840	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined live on this Sunday evening post-Thanksgiving and
64840	67540	first night of Hanukkah with my co-host.
67540	69960	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
69960	70960	Sup.
70960	72960	Hi, how are you?
72960	75160	I'm okay.
75160	76160	Happy Hanukkah.
76160	77160	Happy Hanukkah.
77160	78160	Yeah.
78160	80800	How was your Thanksgiving festivities and celebration?
80800	81800	It was all right.
81800	82800	Dan got a kidney stone.
82800	83800	Oh, no.
83800	87680	Oh, I know we were texting about that, so I was confirmed that's what it was?
87680	88680	Oh, bummer.
88680	89680	Pretty much.
89680	91680	I mean, and I think he passed it because he doesn't hurt anymore, so...
91680	92680	Well, that's good.
92680	93680	Yeah.
93680	94680	Yeah.
94680	99240	So I was taking care of him, and then I had to go to Ikea today, which makes me regret
99240	102520	every single choice in my life that led up to that moment.
102520	104520	That's like a kidney stone of the soul.
104520	109000	Well hello, Tech Master Loki, there with the witty little one-liners we're used to, and
109000	110680	I hope you're doing well as well.
110680	113360	Happy Hanukkah to you and the Mrs. as well, Loki.
113920	114920	Thank you.
114920	119160	So, I gotta go back to Dark Sakura for a minute with the whole Ikea thing.
119160	122800	Did you at least get to reward yourself with meatballs or something lemon berry flavored?
122800	123800	No.
123800	124800	No.
124800	125800	Oh, that's a question.
125800	129320	Because the eatery thing, they didn't even have cinnamon rolls ready.
129320	130320	What?
130320	131320	What?
131320	135360	And I was like, so I made another mistake.
135360	138320	I went to Taco Bell for the first time in four years.
138320	139320	Oh, boy.
139320	140320	Yeah.
140320	141320	And...
141320	142320	Yeah.
142320	146680	I ate half of the quesadilla.
146680	150920	And I further regretted my life's decisions that led up to that particular moment.
150920	153960	I gave the rest of it to Dan, who's like, okay, I'm fine.
153960	154960	Great.
154960	156080	Del Taco is far superior.
156080	158720	Let it be known.
158720	162800	You know, the supply chain issues are very serious when Ikea does not have cinnamon rolls
162800	163800	on time.
163800	164800	This is like...
164800	169040	It wasn't that they had just been sold out and they had another batch baking and I didn't
169040	170040	want to wait for it.
170040	174220	Going to our chat, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice
174220	177020	of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
177020	178020	That's V-O-G network.
178020	182480	It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
182480	185880	Hey, folks listening on the podcast feed, consider following us on Twitch.
185880	186880	We really would appreciate it.
186880	189280	We do some special stuff outside Sunday nights once in a while.
189280	190800	I know we have a special coming up soon.
190800	193280	We'll talk a little bit about that later.
193280	197840	But SHO 100 Mountain Chat says, oh, I like Ikea, but your soul is ripped from you every
197840	199320	moment you're there.
199320	202800	Never feel more drained than being in an Ikea for two hours.
202800	203800	Yeah.
203800	207240	I get claustrophobia because it's hard to find your way out.
207240	208480	That's the thing about Ikea.
208480	211300	You can literally get lost in there.
211300	212960	And it's a little disorienting.
212960	213960	Ugh.
213960	215940	Um, Loki, how are you?
215940	216940	How was your Thanksgiving?
216940	217940	Uh, busy.
217940	227280	I just, you know, uh, we went over to my mama's house and had dinner there and just been playing
227280	231760	and you're an entertainer for the kids the entire week.
231760	235840	Well, it's an important role that somebody's got to do it, but they go back to school tomorrow,
235840	236840	right?
236840	237840	Yes, thankfully.
237840	238840	There's that.
238840	244320	Oh, you had, didn't you have the week off to work on your, uh, like videos and stuff?
244320	245400	Yeah, I did.
245400	248480	So I have been still working on that actually.
248480	254040	Um, cause so next week on Tuesday actually is one 18.
254040	256680	That's when the new update comes out for Minecraft.
256840	260920	And so around that time, the servers are going to be resetting.
260920	268040	So you know, our server on a collusion, I'm, I know they're talking about it.
268040	272820	Must be in another chat other than the discord I'm in, cause I don't see much conversation
272820	273820	going on.
273820	281100	Um, with NerdCraft, I know that they're talking about restarting soon as well.
281100	284760	So it's basically time to kind of wrap up my series.
284760	290320	And so I've been working on the last, um, episode of my series.
290320	291720	So I finished my builds.
291720	299520	I, um, I've been touring the entire server, trying to figure out who everyone's bases
299520	305640	belong to, um, because we didn't have a really good system for that.
305640	310440	So I've been just trying to like forensically figure out who's base belongs to what and
310440	315360	get like some shots of them and like trying to put that all together.
315360	317720	So that's, what's been taken up a ton of my time recently.
317720	324020	Cause there's like so many, we had 70 people on the server, like whitelisted on there.
324020	328640	Not necessarily that they all played or played for a long time, but there's bases everywhere
328640	331960	and it's hard to know what belongs to what.
331960	337240	So I've been just doing my best to try to capture all of them, but I'm sure I'm going
337240	339880	to miss something, but yeah.
339920	343440	So that's what I've been working on recently is just that I've got, like, so all my builds
343440	344440	are done now.
344440	349560	Um, I just need to actually, I need to film my, the last part of my builds.
349560	354040	I'm not necessarily doing a time-lapse cause I don't have time for that, but just capture
354040	358960	like kind of all the stuff that I built and everything and then, um, just wrap it up.
358960	363720	So probably have one more episode left and that's it for this, this season.
363720	364920	Looking forward to that.
364960	369400	Um, and, uh, next week is a pretty big week in gaming for us here at OLR cause you've
369400	374160	got Minecraft, you got a big patch in Minecraft for that and all the content you do, uh, Final
374160	377240	Fantasy XIV Heavensward early access this Friday.
377240	381000	So by this time next week, I'll finally be playing a new XIV expansion.
381000	382000	Very exciting for me.
382000	383120	I'm so ready for it.
383120	386940	Yes, you might recall, we talked a couple of weeks ago about how it was delayed by two
386940	388160	whole weeks.
388160	390600	So they're really putting the finishing touches on it now.
390600	394600	So we're in that period where I should be playing Endwalker, but I'm not, but that's
394600	397760	okay because I'm not a dick when it comes to delayed games.
397760	398760	It is what it is.
398760	402720	Uh, so, but it'll be, it'll be nice to finally be playing that and, uh, well hopefully Dark
402720	403880	Soccer gets something too.
403880	407200	Have they, uh, have they announced the release date for that cool new killer, the artist
407200	408200	in Dead by Daylight?
408200	409200	Is that Tuesday?
409200	410200	I think like tomorrow.
410200	411200	Okay.
411200	413200	So everybody's getting something.
413200	414200	Yeah.
414200	416760	You get DLC and you get DLC and you get DLC.
416760	418920	I also do have Final Fantasy XIV, you know.
418920	419920	Oh, that's true.
419920	424040	I just, I know you, you don't put in as many hours as I do.
424040	425040	Yeah.
425040	428720	I think it's really, I think it's really cool of them to make Prince a new killer in Dead
428720	429720	by Daylight.
429720	430720	I mean, that to be really interesting.
430720	431720	Oh yeah.
431720	432720	The artist.
432720	433720	Yes.
433720	437680	This is the polar opposite of Prince.
437680	441340	Although I wouldn't mind a killer with like a guitar type of thing.
441340	445560	I don't know how that would work, but I would, we already have Kate and she's a killer enough.
445560	447200	Oh yeah.
447200	448200	All Kate's are toxic.
448200	449200	All right.
449200	451200	All Kate's are toxic.
451360	454920	Anyhow, we'll talk more about the games we play in a little bit, but first I want to
454920	456960	get into our kickoff topic tonight.
456960	457960	I'm going to be honest.
457960	461680	It's probably going to be a shorter show here tonight just because with Thanksgiving going
461680	465200	on in the U S and I hope everybody out there had a great Thanksgiving, whatever you ended
465200	466200	up doing.
466200	467800	We had a very small gathering because I didn't talk about mine.
467800	469320	We had a very small gathering with my dad.
469320	472560	It's literally just the three of us, but how's your dad doing?
472560	473560	He's good.
473560	477400	It's really nice to see him and spend a little time with him and he's, he's had some ups
477400	483020	and I guess I'll just say a friend of his passed away and you know, it's just, it, it's
483020	487400	rough when, you know, well, how do I phrase this?
487400	491480	Like, you know, when you watch those older than you, especially in their eighties, like
491480	496280	my dad is where it's like my friends are passing away, like that's just really tough to watch
496280	497280	and so forth.
497280	501800	Another one of his friends is in a home and dad, if you're watching, I'm sorry, but I'm
501800	506800	thinking you know, it does, it does gets worse and I absolutely feel for it.
506800	513600	I remember my grandmom losing a lot of friends, so, so, but I was sometimes my dad watches,
513600	518040	so I'm sorry if you had to hear that, but I just means I'm thinking of my dad and I'm
518040	522320	really treasuring the holiday time that we do get to spend together and so forth.
522320	527960	He will pop in on his iPad once in a while, so I want to make sure I say that as well.
527960	528960	As well you should.
528960	530840	Yes, as well I should.
530840	532800	So where was I going with that?
532800	537240	So oh yes, so I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving as well, although I know we do.
537240	539200	We are fortunate enough to have international listeners.
539200	545960	We have people in Canada, Mexico, Australia, all the various countries in Europe, all over.
545960	548820	We have listeners everywhere around the globe and we're very thankful for that.
548820	553240	So I know not everybody had Thanksgiving, but I hope you had a great week and everybody's
553240	558100	starting to get Black Friday for whatever crazy capitalist reasons.
558100	562280	So if that's a thing you're into, I hope you got some good deals.
562280	565160	I know Cyber Monday coming up is a big thing as well.
565160	572160	I suppose Steam sales are something, you know, or whatever online shop you choose to go to.
572160	576040	I'm sure if no one special was in chat right now, he'd be reminding us, oh, there's these
576040	577600	other stores too, not just Steam.
577600	581400	But you know, with all those online sales, I think it's pretty hard to resist a lot of
581400	582780	great deals in gaming right now.
582780	587520	So I hope you're finding some good deals wherever you are throughout the world.
587520	592320	And if you see some good deals on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, let me know, because that Amazon
592320	596900	one sold out before I could get one, although a good tip from Bobby's show, because we do
596900	600160	tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
600160	602760	Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.
602760	607000	And Bobby was saying on his show tonight that, hey, if you can't find an ultimate Game Pass
607000	611920	Ultimate card, get an Xbox Live Gold card if you see a good deal, because those convert
611920	615240	at about a third, because they're about a third of the price.
615240	619120	So like if you get a year of gold, it'll convert to like four months of ultimate.
619120	624680	So yeah, if I find a good deal for that, heck yeah, I would do that as well.
624680	631660	Anyhow, I want to here at the top of the show, get into our kickoff topic, which goes back
631660	637080	to our roots a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio and a little company we've really followed
637080	638760	their up and downs over the years.
638760	641300	And that's a company called Harmonix.
641300	642340	And I talk about the ups.
642340	648660	I remember, and I'm sure Dark Soccer and Loki remember fondly when Harmonix was a vendor
648660	656760	in Kensho Hall at E3 that was showing off their guitars that they were making for import
656760	659660	Japanese games like Guitar Freaks.
659660	664660	But these guitars had five buttons on them for some reason that we didn't know, because
664660	668660	if you didn't know the Japanese Guitar Freaks game, they only use three buttons.
668660	670660	And we always, why are there five buttons?
670660	675540	And of course, we found out years later, oh, Harmonix got into bigger and better things.
675540	678880	They had some downs when they published in the groove.
678880	679880	And that's no shit.
679880	684120	You know, we had Kyle on the show years ago and, you know, we talked out a lot of our,
684120	688700	you know, kind of things we can see on the back of Harmonix published in the groove.
688700	689700	If I remember right.
689700	690700	Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
690700	691700	I'm always positive.
691700	693500	I thought that was Red Octane that did that.
693500	695100	Am I confusing Harmonix and Red Octane?
695100	696100	I sure am.
696100	697420	I think you're confusing Red Octane with them.
697420	699140	Yeah, Red Octane published in the groove.
699140	700540	I sure am.
700540	703740	And I was thinking, why am I confusing them?
703740	705140	Did they work together on something else?
705140	706140	They must have.
706140	709100	Oh, boy, my grandpa games kicking in.
709100	712500	They had to have collaborated on something because I remember associating this.
712500	713740	Oh, it was it was OK.
713740	722620	I was it was Guitar Hero because Red Octane did those original peripherals for the harmonix
722620	723820	game.
723820	724820	That part.
724820	727500	That's where I'm bleeding it together there.
727500	728500	Yeah.
728500	731540	Bobby Blackwell says Red Octane did the hardware.
731540	732540	Harmonix did the software.
732540	733540	OK, put very so.
733540	736780	OK, so I'm not completely off base and just a little.
736780	737780	Yeah.
737780	738780	For the original.
738780	741860	This was before Activision or any of that stuff.
741860	743340	Yeah.
743340	748740	So anyway, so harmonix, then, of course, their big breakthrough stuff was on the PlayStation
748740	749740	two.
749740	752420	They had frequency and amplitude.
752420	757060	And then they got into, if I remember right, karaoke revolution and some of those, I think
757100	759940	the first karaoke revolution was harmonix developed.
759940	760940	Right.
760940	766540	I know Konami published it, but I think the early ones were done by them and they they
766540	767540	did a lot.
767540	769180	So, OK, thank you.
769180	775220	Bobby says, yes, Activision bought Red Octane, who had the Guitar Hero IP, which is why harmonix
775220	777820	was bought by MTV and did rock band.
777820	779460	That's how that all went down.
779460	780460	That whole thing.
780460	781460	Thank you.
781460	782460	OK.
782460	783460	So I was only a little crazy.
783980	790220	But harmonix, obviously, you know, we have been following whether correctly or not for
790220	793380	the past many, many years of this show.
793380	800820	I remember when Guitar Hero first came out, you guys were on the news about it.
800820	802940	I wasn't because I couldn't be there that day.
802940	805880	I think that clip is still on YouTube somewhere.
805880	807780	Is that where the Loki it's no, no, no.
807780	810140	That is not where the Loki it's so much fun clip comes from.
810140	813320	That was a different that was the one I was there for when they talked about podcasting
813320	814320	and we were in it.
814320	816540	But there's that there's a clip out there because they went to Jamie's house.
816540	817540	You remember this?
817540	821040	And they did the Guitar Hero interview and you guys got to play it.
821040	822880	And it was on the news and all that stuff.
822880	825280	So that was cool.
825280	826280	And then that's pretty fun.
826280	827280	Yeah.
827280	828280	Yeah.
828280	832480	It was it was it was nice when people gave a shit about what we had to say.
832480	836600	But harmonix, you know, they've they've had some ups and downs.
836600	840360	They developed some pretty cool stuff, you know, in VR.
840360	841760	But then not everything took off.
841760	845380	Like they tried to do a music game shooter that didn't end up get really taken up off
845380	846440	the ground.
846440	849920	I personally was not a fan of the Kickstarter frequency game.
849920	851720	I know other people were.
851720	854640	I still wanted to see harmonix do very well.
854640	857840	Well, and then some could argue they have done very well.
857840	859360	They have they have been sold.
859360	866080	This week is the news is that Epic has purchased harmonix.
866080	872440	And it actually goes a step further because we know exactly why Epic bought harmonix,
872440	877800	because it actually says in a statement that the Fortnite folks put out or Epic put out
877800	882360	is that harmonix will continue to support the existing slate of games.
882360	884000	So there will still be rock band stuff.
884000	886240	There will still be Fuser stuff.
886240	888180	And anything that's still on Steam will be there.
888180	897580	But Epic and harmonix will now be collaborating on music based enhancements for Fortnite,
897580	901220	which at first glance, you probably go, what the fuck?
901220	906060	Fortnite is a is a shooty shooty bang bang game.
906060	911260	But of course, you might recall about six or seven weeks here ago on the show, maybe
911260	912260	longer.
912260	914180	Time is a construct.
914180	919020	So we were talking about the Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite.
919020	924640	And I was mentioning how, you know, considering Fortnite has this reputation as battle royale
924640	926520	shooty shooty bang bang.
926520	930540	This Ariana Grande concert was actually one of the neater things that got me to kind of
930540	935180	turn my head and pay attention to what Fortnite was doing, because it essentially was an interactive
935180	936840	music video is what they did.
936840	943180	And it just kind of used the Fortnite engine and the Fortnite world to kind of do that.
943180	947220	So when you look at something like that, and then you think, oh, harmonix is going
947220	949140	to be working with music based stuff.
949140	955500	I also think about Fusor and how, you know, Fusor and its predecessor drop mix the in
955500	962500	person game, how those two were really good at like blending music together and letting
962500	968460	you do your own type of musical type of experience like, you know, the the music that you end
968460	970980	up making in Fusor is kind of rad.
970980	973740	Like it's fun like to play with those old songs, right?
973740	978860	So to think that some of that could be what Fortnite, I mean, we don't know exactly what
978860	982940	they are doing for Fortnite, but it could be something along those lines where you're
982940	987960	making the own your own soundtrack to your own experience.
987960	991820	And possibly as people are building their own worlds and, you know, doing the things
991820	996140	that they're doing in Fortnite besides just battle royale, maybe folks are going to be
996140	1000700	able to leverage harmonic types of tools, harmonix types of tools to build their own
1000700	1006980	soundtracks and musical experiences and build their own Ariana Grande concerts within Fortnite.
1006980	1010540	That's kind of what I take from this announcement.
1010540	1011540	I don't know.
1011540	1014180	Loki, what did you think about the whole thing?
1014180	1017580	I mean, it's just.
1017580	1022340	I'm glad, you know, honestly, I'm kind of glad that someone bought them because, like,
1022340	1025340	I don't know what they've been doing recently.
1025340	1030700	I don't know if they would have the financial backing to last much longer.
1030700	1035380	I mean, it just doesn't seem like that they're kind of the heyday harmonics that we used
1035380	1036380	to know.
1036380	1040540	So it'd be good to have the financial backing of Epic and hopefully Epic just lets them
1040540	1047100	kind of do what they want to do and be creative, kind of like how they've done with like, oh,
1047100	1052540	gosh, Rocket League and that kind of stuff where they own them, but they're kind of doing
1052540	1054900	their own thing.
1054940	1058700	So I'm curious to see what they kind of do with that, because, you know, Harmonics is
1058700	1061060	a very creative company.
1061060	1064300	And, you know, they've been doing a lot of creative things.
1064300	1069340	Chat would like to remind you Fuser is a recent release, but I will give you the fact that
1069340	1074540	Fuser was essentially a port of drop mix, you know, of sorts.
1074540	1078100	But anyway, just to be fair, they have been putting out things recently.
1078100	1079100	Right.
1079100	1080100	Yeah.
1080100	1083340	And I know they have, but I don't think they've been like wildly successful, like, say, Rock
1083340	1084780	Band was or something like that.
1084780	1085780	I mean, sure.
1085780	1086780	Sure.
1086780	1087780	Probably not necessarily.
1087780	1088780	Nothing's going to be.
1088780	1089780	Yeah, right.
1089780	1090780	Exactly.
1090780	1093820	So I would say, though, it's good to see that they have a financial backing of a company
1093820	1094820	like that.
1094820	1098940	Hopefully that allows them to be able to make some of these things that they haven't been
1098940	1099940	able to get off the ground.
1099940	1103180	We don't have to do any more kickstarters for games and stuff like that.
1103180	1107060	They can just make and publish the stuff that they want to make.
1107060	1108060	Sure.
1108060	1110260	It may be under like the Fortnite brand or something like that.
1110260	1113980	But Fortnite has been getting kind of creative on its own with different things.
1113980	1119100	So it wouldn't be surprising that they incorporate something with that, because it is a huge
1119100	1120100	brand.
1120100	1123140	Well, and I wonder if harmonics is concept of the music game shooter.
1123140	1125060	And I'm sorry, I forgot what it was called.
1125060	1126060	Something about.
1126060	1133780	I don't remember somebody in chat will remember, but maybe there are concepts from that that
1133780	1138460	were interesting because, you know, let's say, OK, Fortnite is a shooty shooty bang bang.
1138460	1143140	Maybe they want to do a music mode type of thing to draw in a different audience that
1143140	1147020	tends to write off Fortnite as a shooty shooty bang bang game.
1147020	1153420	So maybe they are trying to partner up with companies that do radically different things
1153420	1156020	to bring radically different experiences to Fortnite.
1156020	1160900	And maybe, you know, I know I'm reaching here, but maybe some of that music game shooter
1160900	1166460	stuff will have its day after all in Fortnite.
1166460	1170820	Going to some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network as we are taping live tonight,
1170820	1174460	SG100Matt says, I guess I'm OK with Epic buying them.
1174460	1178140	If it was EA, they would be dissolved or forced to work on a battlefield game.
1178140	1181060	I guess they're going to be working on Fortnite, but it could be worse.
1181060	1185660	Yeah, it could be worse, especially, you know, if you're I don't know, I have my ups and
1185660	1187100	downs with Epic.
1187100	1189420	There's a lot of things I like that Epic does.
1189420	1191540	There's a lot of things I don't like that Epic does.
1191540	1193780	And namely, it's Tim Sweeney's Twitter account.
1193780	1198660	But that's a whole other topic for a different day.
1198660	1205060	Yeah, I mean, I would like to see Fortnite as far as the whole metaverse concept, right,
1205060	1208940	which seems to be this big thing we're moving into in the 20s.
1208940	1212580	Everybody wants to it's the metaverse in 20s.
1212580	1217020	Literally that company called Meta that I'm still calling Facebook wants to do it.
1217020	1220060	Niantic has talked about their wanting to do it.
1220060	1221480	Fortnite wants to do it in their own way.
1221480	1226040	And these are all three very different approaches to the metaverse.
1226040	1227900	And there's other companies wanting to do this as well.
1228140	1231140	As long as they all stay the fuck away from NFTs.
1231140	1234980	Tigerclaw in chat says, what if Valve were to buy them?
1234980	1236260	Well, that would have been cool.
1236260	1241660	But OK, you want to talk about a company that really hasn't done any games lately.
1241660	1242660	Let's talk about Valve.
1242660	1245500	Well, I guess there was Half-Life Alyx, but how long did that take?
1245500	1247100	How long did that take?
1247100	1253460	We're all bitter that there's no Portal 3 or Half-Life 3 or anything 3.
1253460	1254460	So yeah.
1255100	1257020	Dr. C says, I agree with Rob.
1257020	1259420	I wonder if they'll do something like that in Fortnite.
1259420	1266260	I suppose only time will tell, but we know Fortnite craves those musical experiences
1266260	1268700	as evidenced by the variety.
1268700	1270140	It's not just Ariana Grande.
1270140	1272460	That's just the one that got my attention as a gay.
1272460	1273940	I have to support that.
1273940	1277140	But there's lots of what Travis Scott had a concert in Fortnite, too.
1277140	1278140	There's been countless.
1278140	1281780	I remember there was a Weezer album that debuted in Fortnite because I actually looked at that
1281780	1283000	level and that whole thing.
1283040	1285040	It actually got me to look.
1285040	1293800	So I'm curious to see what music can do to change the conversation of Fortnite from its
1293800	1295680	just Battle Royale.
1295680	1298000	I think that could be very interesting.
1298000	1299120	So we'll see.
1299120	1300760	And best of luck to everyone at Harmonix.
1300760	1302920	I just hope this doesn't mean layoffs or any of this garbage.
1302920	1307520	I hope it means more people and more folks to help on all that stuff.
1307520	1312040	Because we know Epic has oodles and oodles of money.
1312080	1317200	Speaking of Epic and that whole thing, Dark Soccer, relevant to your interest, certainly,
1317200	1320840	and I'm sure you're already aware, Dead by Daylight is going to be free on the Epic store
1320840	1327200	next week because this is the big launch of Dead by Daylight on the Epic store.
1327200	1328200	It's not there yet.
1328200	1333160	But apparently it is going to be cross purchases with Steam, Stadia.
1333160	1334160	I think that's it.
1334160	1335160	Because Switch isn't in on that.
1335160	1337160	Steam and Stadia are the only two that have.
1337160	1338160	Oh, Windows Store.
1338160	1339160	Windows Store.
1339160	1340160	I forgot.
1340160	1346640	Windows Store doesn't have the tie in to the behavior account.
1346640	1347640	You are right.
1347640	1348880	Stadia and Steam do right now.
1348880	1349880	You are right.
1349880	1350880	Sorry.
1350880	1352920	I was thinking about the postgame chat and how they do have that.
1352920	1354880	But anyway, that's that's totally different.
1354880	1361040	Yeah, no, but and actually the thing is, is that it's really just cross progression.
1361040	1365160	I still had to buy all my DLC on Steam and Stadia.
1365160	1366800	I didn't know that.
1366800	1367800	Gross.
1367800	1370440	Well, cross progression is nice, at least, I guess.
1370440	1373200	So well, yeah.
1373200	1378600	And for those of you that I think all of my in-game purchases, like my cosmetics and whatnot,
1378600	1379800	those carry over with me.
1379800	1381280	OK, that makes sense.
1381280	1383700	Probably everything original probably carries over.
1383700	1386560	Just not the license stuff is probably the tricky thing with that.
1386560	1390920	No, the license stuff should carry over, I mean, because I bought the Stranger Things
1390920	1392920	DLC on Steam.
1392920	1394680	Oh, nice.
1394680	1399840	So I'll have that on both because I paid for them on both.
1399840	1406080	But my in-game stuff, because I bought, you know, Jonathan Byers as one of my characters,
1406080	1407900	you know, the skin for Steve.
1407900	1413680	I should have I have all of the Stranger Things content and it should carry over.
1413680	1416640	I just don't have a PC I can test it on.
1416640	1417640	Fair.
1417640	1420880	Unless we logged into my Steam account or something on your computer to test it out.
1420880	1421880	I don't know.
1421880	1422880	Yeah.
1423080	1426360	Well, if you're if you're sick of hearing Dark Sakura and I talk about Dead by Daylight
1426360	1431280	all the time, this is this this is your chance to see if it's for you because it and for
1431280	1433900	whatever reason, you don't have Game Pass either and have checked it out that way.
1433900	1435800	It will be free on the Epic Store next week.
1435800	1440840	So you can keyboard and mouse away or plug in a controller, do it that way, whatever.
1440840	1441840	So there you go.
1441840	1444480	I guess there is that particular PSA about that.
1444480	1447700	But yeah, Epic Games has bought Harmonix.
1447700	1452300	So we will see how this partnership develops, but it's probably going to be several months
1452720	1455980	before we see any of that result.
1455980	1460020	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1460020	1461720	been playing this week.
1461720	1462820	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
1462820	1464940	How was your gaming week?
1464940	1470820	I played Dead by Daylight and it's double XP this weekend.
1470820	1475340	And what else did I do?
1475340	1481220	I've played Wordscapes, I've played Fantasian.
1481220	1482220	That's really about it.
1483140	1492980	I picked up Slave Aspire and I bought some PC games, hoping that they would work on the
1492980	1495700	sale going on right now.
1495700	1507580	Oh, geez, sorry, I hit the wrong thing and it decided to also not work.
1508460	1518980	Right now there is so much going on that it's a little bit hard to get everything in line
1518980	1523780	and get everything going with all the other games that are on my list to play.
1523780	1528660	I could check my Steam purchase history real quick and tell you what I bought.
1528660	1530980	Your Steam backlog has been growing.
1530980	1536420	I've also been buying apps on Steam, like the Discord bot creator.
1536420	1538140	Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing.
1538140	1543180	Oh, yeah, there's plenty of good apps on Steam.
1543180	1547020	I've bought music makers, specifically the Discord app.
1547020	1548140	I didn't know that was a thing.
1548140	1549500	I never would have thought to look for that.
1549500	1556180	But I know they have game engine creator things, some of the big game maker stuff is on Steam.
1556180	1563740	What I just bought is Tempest 4000 and Yara's Revenge, they're both on sale.
1563740	1571700	Gorgoa, Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, Discord bot studio, Dimension Drive and Easy Pose for drawing.
1571700	1574780	I also picked up Kung Fury Street Rage.
1574780	1575700	Why not?
1575700	1578300	And I did get Poppy Playtime.
1578300	1582300	Oh, no, I still need to play that.
1582300	1584980	So soon, soon, soon.
1584980	1587140	I also did because it's for Mac.
1587140	1589580	I got Planescape Torment.
1589580	1592500	I'm actually thinking about playing it on Steam.
1592500	1594460	Yeah, cool.
1594460	1596340	All right, Loki, how about you?
1596340	1597740	How was your gaming week?
1597740	1600540	I didn't play a whole ton other than Minecraft.
1600540	1609540	I did play Minecraft Dungeons, though, because we took the kids to the local skating rink
1609540	1612060	and they've upgraded all their arcade games.
1612060	1616620	And so now they have the Minecraft Dungeons arcade game, which is pretty fun.
1616620	1621340	And what's neat about that one is not only is it, you know, it kind of reminds me a lot
1621340	1627860	of like the old Gauntlet Legends games, but you get like cards from the game every time
1627860	1628860	you play it.
1628860	1635340	And you can use the cards like scan into basically get different armor sets and different like
1635340	1643660	so you have like a armor set, a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and a familiar.
1643660	1648180	And so you can scan those in to get different like pets and stuff.
1648180	1649180	So it's pretty cool.
1649180	1651220	It's like a collection of cards from playing that.
1651220	1652220	Hmm.
1652220	1656940	That sounds like Derby Owners Club or Initial D in the arcade back in the day.
1656940	1657940	Yeah.
1657940	1658940	Yeah, a little bit like that.
1658940	1660820	But yeah, you get cards every time.
1660820	1662940	And that's been is pretty fun.
1662940	1667780	So I guess I'll just have to play the actual game that I own first.
1667780	1672420	I don't know why I'm playing in the arcade when I can just play it at home.
1672420	1677780	But yeah, I miss I miss Dark Sakura's File of Horses.
1677780	1682460	She had this big old thing that you unzipped and plop.
1682460	1685780	It's it was probably for like baseball cards or other types of trading cards.
1685780	1689500	It was a billfold, like cards tall.
1689500	1693100	But it was like, let's let me whip out one of my horses and, you know, thumbing through
1693100	1694100	the pages.
1694100	1695100	Oh, there's there's Polteri.
1695100	1697940	There's, you know, and all these horses that she had.
1697940	1699780	I just cracked me up.
1699780	1704060	The Derby Owners Club hardcore, though, like all had that all had that it was always funny
1704060	1705060	to watch.
1705060	1708580	So I had all those those names.
1708580	1712340	Pod Culture is mentioning the Injustice arcade game was kind of like that, too, with character
1712340	1713340	cards.
1713340	1714340	Interesting.
1714340	1715340	I guess at least you get something.
1715340	1716340	Yeah.
1716340	1717340	Something besides tickets.
1717340	1720800	I'm not sure this is going to come over on the webcam when we try.
1720800	1723140	But I got I got my magazine.
1723140	1724140	Oh, yeah.
1724140	1726100	The magazine you were featured in over in the UK.
1726100	1727100	Congrats on that.
1727100	1728100	Yes.
1728100	1729100	Yes.
1729100	1730100	I got that.
1730100	1731100	I got a few copies of that.
1731100	1732100	So we got.
1732100	1733100	Yeah.
1733100	1734100	That's sweet.
1734140	1735140	What did they do?
1735140	1736140	Did they mention O.L.R.?
1736140	1737140	No.
1737140	1738140	And they also never mind.
1738140	1739140	All right.
1739140	1740140	No, just kidding.
1740140	1743780	They took some liberties with trying to figure out what the story of the game was, even though
1743780	1745780	I did send them a synopsis of it.
1745780	1749560	So apparently now the game does actually take place in New York.
1749560	1755820	It is canon now because of the I guess because the first level Central Park, you know, they
1755820	1758100	assume that, oh, well, let's go to New York.
1758100	1759100	Yeah.
1759100	1760100	It must be New York.
1760100	1761100	And yeah.
1761100	1763660	So I thought it was kind of funny.
1764220	1765220	Yeah.
1765220	1766220	It's.
1766220	1767220	Yeah.
1767220	1771820	And they were so confident about it, too, like they're like, you know, the game sees
1771820	1776620	you take control of a guy who doesn't just like people jogging in his city, New York,
1776620	1777620	to be precise.
1777620	1778620	Like, OK.
1778620	1779620	Oh, wow.
1779620	1780620	York now.
1780620	1781620	All right.
1781620	1784060	I guess somebody else wrote your game.
1784060	1785060	That's fine.
1785060	1786060	But yeah, it's cool.
1786060	1788340	They're just like, oh, an American made it.
1788340	1789340	It's in New York.
1789340	1790340	Yeah.
1790340	1791340	It's just it's all good.
1791340	1792340	You know what?
1792340	1793340	It doesn't matter.
1794020	1795020	It can be in New York.
1795020	1797460	It can be in your hometown, whatever you want it to be, whatever you whatever your head
1797460	1798980	cannon says it is.
1798980	1799980	Exactly.
1799980	1802780	You can you can pixel poop wherever you like, of course.
1802780	1804540	Well, congratulations on the magazine feature.
1804540	1805540	That's really cool.
1805540	1808020	And that's that's cool shit magazine over in the UK.
1808020	1812140	So hopefully folks overseas, I don't know if they can go into like a Barnes and Noble
1812140	1813140	type thing.
1813140	1814140	Yeah.
1814140	1815140	You can.
1815140	1816140	Yeah, I'm not sure.
1816140	1817140	I mean, it's a very nice magazine.
1817140	1819540	I have to say, like, if I actually saw this in the store, like I would definitely pick
1819540	1820540	it up.
1820540	1821740	It's like very premium feeling.
1821740	1822740	Cool.
1823140	1824140	It's pretty cool.
1824140	1829180	They've got like reviews of like old toys and like old movies and all sorts of weird
1829180	1830180	stuff in here.
1830180	1831460	So it's like really cool.
1831460	1833780	Are you saying it's full of cool shit?
1833780	1834780	It is full.
1834780	1835780	Yes.
1835780	1837380	All right.
1837380	1841380	If you want to order that online, if you're in the US or somewhere else, you want to order
1841380	1842380	that.
1842380	1846020	Loki did put a link on his Twitter over at Twitter dot com slash Loki O.L.R. if you want
1846020	1850420	to follow up on that and order yourself some cool shit.
1850420	1851420	My gaming week.
1851620	1854540	So like everybody else, you know, the holidays and everything kind of got in the way.
1854540	1855820	So I haven't played a lot.
1855820	1860020	I play I've also been doing Dead by Daylight, kind of like our soccer has been trying to
1860020	1861380	enjoy the double blood point event.
1861380	1866920	I finally prestiged Cheryl slash James today up to level one.
1866920	1868540	So I have to start them over.
1868540	1869580	Why did I prestige?
1869580	1870580	I don't know.
1870580	1871580	It's the thing to do, I guess.
1871580	1872580	So I've been working on that.
1872580	1874380	I only have two prestigious.
1874380	1876540	Yeah, I have I have Dwight prestige.
1876540	1878260	I don't think I have any killers.
1878300	1883220	So it's something I because I hate how you lose everything, but that's part of it.
1883220	1885140	I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.
1885140	1888780	I'm trying to finish up that Moogle tome event because I want that leather jacket.
1888780	1890300	I've gotten all the mounts I need.
1890300	1892220	I've gotten the pets, everything else.
1892220	1894140	But it's that hundred tome leather jacket.
1894140	1899180	And it's like, oh, the awful grind of having to do Praetorium or something like that over
1899180	1900660	and over again to get the tomes.
1900660	1905100	But hey, I'll get there and I will get my leather jacket to complete my look for Endwalker
1905100	1906260	on Friday.
1906260	1909340	I hope this doesn't mean the game is down all day Thursday.
1909340	1914100	They haven't really said or at least I've missed it if there was all day maintenance,
1914100	1916740	but I'm assuming there has to be before an expansion releases.
1916740	1922380	So I guess that is going to come quick and fast this this week as we lead up to Friday's
1922380	1924860	early access for Endwalker.
1924860	1929580	The other big game I've honestly been playing a lot of this weekend is No Man's Sky, which
1929580	1932700	I have talked about plenty on this show before.
1932700	1934700	Why am I back on this bullshit again?
1934700	1939900	Well, because No Man's Sky announced that they are going to be repeating the different
1939900	1941160	expeditions.
1941160	1946580	So these seasonal events, you know, we kind of took to mean seasonal, meaning if you miss
1946580	1950060	it, you're going to miss it forever and you won't be able to get these rewards again.
1950060	1954980	Well, it's actually kind of neat because during this kind of slower holiday period between,
1954980	1958720	you know, from Thanksgiving until New Year's, you know, you have all these holidays going
1958720	1959720	on.
1959720	1962900	It is kind of interesting how the team over at Hello Games has just decided, well, let's
1962900	1968240	repeat the original expeditions for a shorter time so that those that missed them can catch
1968240	1969240	up on them.
1969240	1972700	So because I never finished Expedition One, I did two and three.
1972700	1974940	I didn't do one and four completely.
1974940	1979260	So I am trying to like put the pedal to the metal, so to speak, and try to finish Expedition
1979260	1981640	One to get my rewards.
1981640	1985500	And then I'll be able to sit out two and three while I'm busy playing the Final Fantasy 14
1985500	1992620	expansion and then move on to Expedition Four when that recaps towards the end of the year.
1992620	1995220	So I've been playing quite a bit of that trying to finish up Expedition One.
1995220	2000940	I am further than I was the first time, but they also compressed the expeditions a little
2000940	2001940	bit.
2001940	2003440	So they all they start on new planets.
2003440	2004820	That was the first thing I noticed.
2004820	2008820	It's not the exact same as it was before.
2008820	2011260	And they've cut down some of the grinds.
2011260	2016260	So I remember before, I think you had to do like 10 freighter missions, but now you only
2016260	2017880	have to do three.
2017880	2020380	And I think there were some other things that you had to do a lot more of.
2020380	2024100	Like I think there were 10 artifacts and now again, you only have to do three.
2024100	2027620	So I think they did cut down a bunch of stuff to fit the two-week timeframe.
2027620	2030060	But if you're going to get into this because of what I'm saying and I'm letting you know
2030060	2033400	the expeditions are back and you're like, oh, I want to finish Expedition One too.
2033400	2038700	You need to start now because you're like today, because there are some things that
2038700	2043020	you grind that you're not going to get done by Friday if you wait until Thursday to do
2043020	2044020	it.
2044020	2046820	Like the three freighter missions is going to be impossible.
2046820	2050620	You're not going to be able to do three of the five freighter missions because they're
2050620	2052900	going to be too difficult for your brand new freighter.
2052900	2060980	So just something to think about and all that as you are going into No Man's Sky.
2060980	2066500	I'm also really excited because Alan has picked up No Man's Sky again from this.
2066500	2071320	So he's doing Expedition One right now, although he's playing on Steam and something bugged
2071320	2073660	out on him that made him really frustrated.
2073660	2078300	Like he couldn't get the frigate for free that you're supposed to get, so he had to
2078300	2079300	buy it.
2079300	2080300	Like really frustrating.
2080300	2084220	It didn't happen to me on Xbox Series X where I'm playing.
2084220	2090660	So he's been doing that, but he's really big on now he can do that Normandy mission that
2090660	2094840	he missed because that was Expedition Two was the one and it was only up for two or
2094840	2096260	three weeks the first time.
2096260	2100400	And that's the one that rewarded the Normandy at the end.
2100400	2103080	Now keep in mind, you don't get to fly the Normandy.
2103080	2106360	You don't really get to tour the Normandy, you can fly around it and look at it up close
2106360	2108000	and all that stuff.
2108000	2109000	But that's it.
2109000	2112760	It is just another addition to your fleet that's purely cosmetic.
2112760	2117080	So it's not going to be suddenly No Man's Mass Effect.
2117080	2120280	It's just a very simple little artistic crossover.
2120280	2125600	And they do like Paragon and Renegade titles and other throws to the Mass Effect universe.
2125600	2126840	That's really it.
2126840	2131820	But I still think it's cool and as a uber fan of both those games, but I already did
2131820	2132820	it the first time.
2132820	2136420	I don't need to do it again, but I'm excited that Alan, who is an uber fan of at least
2136420	2140440	Mass Effect and trying to get back to No Man's Sky can do both those things now.
2140440	2144540	So yeah, I will probably stream at some point this week.
2144540	2147580	I'm going to try and get back into my regular post-work streams.
2147580	2150580	I have been playing actually a lot of mobile gaming as well still.
2150580	2155100	I was going pretty hard on Ingress because they were doing double AP, but that is winding
2155100	2157740	up tomorrow and it's been really good for exercise.
2157740	2161040	I've been trying to get more exercise lately with everything I've talked about in the prior
2161040	2165200	weeks on this show and Pikmin actually.
2165200	2169520	Alan and I went on a walk today in Pikmin and you know, in Pikmin you can plant flowers.
2169520	2171280	That's kind of the thing that you do.
2171280	2176640	And we planted blue pansies, both of us, and we walked around the park and we walked around
2176640	2179640	the bud, the flower bud at the park so many times.
2179640	2185080	We got it to spawn a blue rose and I haven't even seen that that game has blue roses.
2185080	2186720	I knew it had red roses.
2186720	2188920	I'd seen screen caps of that and I saw it in San Francisco.
2188920	2192080	I have never seen a blue rose in that game anywhere online.
2192080	2197040	Granted, I don't do a lot of reading on Pikmin Blue, but we got one to spawn here today and
2197040	2198040	that was really exciting.
2198040	2202720	So if you're trying to play in that game, get a lot, a lot of pansies planted instead
2202720	2204320	of the regular flowers.
2204320	2208480	And I think it increases your chances at spawning a rose and yes, it dropped rose petals.
2208480	2211760	So I got blue rose petals, but only like a few.
2211760	2216640	So yeah, so lots of mobile gaming, but that's been very good for exercising too.
2216640	2222480	I just have to say like you, I know many of you can kind of give or take Pikmin Bloom
2222480	2226280	and I'm not trying to pretend that the game is like, oh my God, it's the most amazing
2226280	2233000	thing that's ever happened, but it has gamified exercising and walking for me at a time that
2233000	2234400	I really needed it.
2234400	2242480	I got 10,000 steps Friday, Saturday, and I think one other day this week.
2242480	2245800	So I didn't get it today because I let myself rest a little bit, but I'll probably get 5,000
2245840	2247960	because I'll probably go on a walk after the show.
2247960	2251280	So it's been very, very, very good for incentivizing all that.
2251280	2256560	So thanks to Niantic, who liked my tweet about the blue rose, by the way, Niantic actually
2256560	2257560	liked that.
2257560	2258560	I thought that was cute.
2258560	2259560	Yeah.
2259560	2260560	All right.
2260560	2261560	Let's move on.
2261560	2264840	We're going to get into some stories for the week again, with it being Thanksgiving in
2264840	2269040	the US this week, there wasn't a lot of news, but there's still some things going on in
2269040	2271980	the gaming world we thought we'd bring to the table tonight.
2272020	2275100	So Loki, why don't you start us off with our first story?
2275100	2277500	All right.
2277500	2284260	So let's go ahead and talk about this drama that's going on with Roblox and not necessarily
2284260	2293700	that Roblox is being sued by a company, especially for, you know, unfair payment of their developers.
2293700	2299060	But no, this is actually Roblox suing somebody on the platform.
2299060	2305720	So there's this guy, Ruben Sim, who's been accused of sexual harassment, terrorist threats,
2305720	2309700	and trying to post pictures of Hitler on there.
2309700	2315680	Apparently, he has been doing this for a while, it sounds like.
2315680	2318020	So back in...
2318020	2319020	He's garbage.
2319020	2320020	Yeah.
2320020	2321020	Some of the things he's done.
2321020	2326140	So he glamorized the April 3rd, 2018 active shooter and murder at YouTube headquarters
2326140	2332180	and said that something similar should happen to the Roblox headquarters in San Mateo.
2332180	2339100	He attempted to upload a nude image of himself with only a lampshade covering him.
2339100	2340680	All sorts of different slurs.
2340680	2344940	He tried to upload a sex game and upload pictures of Hitler.
2344940	2353060	So apparently also used his subscribers to try to do other things as well.
2353060	2357180	So yeah, it's just a piece of trash.
2357180	2359820	And so now they are suing him for damages.
2359820	2360820	Good.
2360820	2361820	TBH.
2361820	2362820	Good.
2362820	2367780	Like, you know, I think heading into this, I was kind of like, well, that seems kind
2367780	2369000	of extreme.
2369000	2373580	Like you would go and sue a YouTuber that's like playing pranks, but I guess that they're
2373580	2375000	actually trying to break your game.
2375000	2381540	But now that you've explained what this individual is doing, and this really sounds like an unwell
2381540	2387880	individual in many senses, the word good, I'm actually totally team Roblox on this.
2387880	2392320	I think it's time to start making an example of some of these individuals that literally
2392320	2395800	think there is no repercussion for these sorts of things.
2395800	2398960	And also, I'm sorry, there's also another piece to it also.
2398960	2405880	He also made terrorist threats, basically that called in fake bomb threats to the Roblox
2405880	2407620	developers conference in San Francisco.
2407620	2408820	So there's that too.
2408820	2412800	This person is not well, but it certainly doesn't excuse any of this behavior.
2412800	2416920	And this person really deserves a wake up call of the highest regard.
2416920	2418740	And I think this lawsuit is the way to do it.
2418740	2426500	And quite frankly, for these extreme scenarios, especially, I hope to see more game companies
2426500	2428380	do it.
2428380	2431120	Good, good.
2431120	2432120	Bring it all out.
2432120	2435520	Bring out the facts in a court of law, put it on the public record.
2435520	2437160	Let these people know.
2437160	2443860	There is accountability somewhere for these actions.
2443860	2448200	It's what a lot of us have been begging for that stream and do this stuff on Twitch and
2448200	2457220	so forth when we hear about marginalized creators, whether it be black people, brown people,
2457220	2462840	different religious people streaming, whether it be gay, lesbian, transgender, non-binary,
2462840	2463840	you name it.
2463840	2468200	All these marginalized groups on Twitch, they all get targeted with swatting.
2468200	2470740	Women get targeted with swatting.
2470740	2471840	It's disgusting.
2471840	2475560	And we've been begging for accountability for these individuals.
2475560	2480680	The best news that ever happened was when Twitch sued the two people that were apparently
2480680	2483400	behind the Haas stuff, right?
2483400	2485720	Some time ago or something along those lines.
2485720	2486720	Hooray!
2486720	2487720	That was long overdue.
2487720	2488720	Hooray.
2488720	2489720	Yes.
2489720	2496080	It sucks that, like, you know, it's having to be handled in a civil courtroom as opposed
2496080	2498480	to a criminal one where it ought to be handled.
2498480	2499880	Some of these swatting incidents.
2499880	2505880	Well, and this guy's still got his channel of 700,000 subscribers on YouTube.
2505880	2510040	He's still platformed on YouTube because apparently they think this is OK.
2510040	2511040	I don't know.
2511040	2515940	Who the fuck would subscribe to something like I.
2515940	2522260	The fact that 700,000 people subscribe to that, I'm going to write off that there are
2522260	2527300	bot accounts of which there's usually many tied to something, but even still, even if
2527300	2533660	you have that and assume that 300,000 of them are real, that is far too many people.
2533660	2542940	And that's that says a lot about why society feels really broken sometimes.
2542940	2544980	And I don't know what else to say about that all the time.
2545020	2546020	I know.
2546020	2549580	I don't know what else to say about that on my little video game podcast with my friends.
2549580	2557540	Like I but just just marinate in that for a minute, 750,000 accounts, half of which
2557540	2561060	sure are probably bots and, you know, throwaways.
2561060	2567460	But at least half of that are following this person's content and essentially encouraging
2567460	2574460	and egging that on nude pictures, pictures of Hitler in a children's game.
2574940	2583100	Hmm. I don't know, I'm disgusted, too, and that's why I'm I'm actually kind of glad to
2583100	2588740	see Roblox suing them, throw the it should be a criminal trial, quite frankly.
2588740	2594060	It shouldn't be a civil trial, but you know how it goes sometimes with a criminal or the
2594060	2596380	criminal court won't do it.
2596380	2597940	Civil court will do it.
2597940	2599860	So anyway, yeah.
2599860	2604580	And I see a lot of folks in chat, Mike Deaf saying seven hundred thousand subs, the fuck.
2604580	2606620	Yeah, my reaction exactly.
2606700	2608340	I see seven hundred seventy four now, but.
2610540	2614100	Well, because of all the coverage this is getting, it's actually probably encouraging
2614100	2618900	more people with with such wonderful hits as swearing at Roblox admins with voice chat,
2618900	2622340	that that's one of his higher ranking videos of of late.
2623980	2628100	Just. Yeah, he's just constantly harassing people online.
2628220	2634260	Whatever happened to calling most tavern and asking for Mike last name hunt, whatever happened
2634260	2638260	to that, that is silly, ridiculous.
2638660	2645260	And the pain, you know, there's no you know, it goes away in 15 seconds.
2645260	2646580	It's a stupid fucking prank.
2647140	2649180	What? And then you're done.
2649620	2653780	What Loki's describing here is not a stupid fucking prank.
2654060	2655820	This is like like if you think about it.
2656900	2659020	Is psychological damage on children.
2659740	2664020	It is. It's disgusting and there's no excuse for it.
2664460	2665460	Absolutely not.
2667140	2671780	Fifth dream in chat with it, fifth dream in chat with a decent point, actually saying
2671780	2678580	caller ID happened, you know, and I realized the concept of Internet ID would be
2678580	2682620	controversial and I'm not even sure I am completely in favor of something like that.
2682620	2687860	However, there has to be some sort of accountability for people like this and for
2687860	2692620	people that are phoning in false SWAT reports and things of that nature.
2692780	2694260	Where's the accountability?
2694260	2699780	It's not until I and so I applaud Roblox for starting, even though I think it's a
2699780	2703260	ridiculous game and platform, but it's for kids, whatever.
2703260	2705220	It's not for me. I'm not the audience.
2705420	2712020	Fine. I applaud Roblox and thank them for taking this person to court and getting it
2712020	2716820	out in the open and putting it on public record, because that's where this has to be
2716820	2717980	solved, unfortunately.
2718500	2720740	Gross. Just so disgusted.
2721900	2723980	SSJ 100 Matt says he's doing it for the subs.
2724300	2728740	Whatever YouTube revenue he thought he was going to get is going to Roblox.
2728900	2734140	And quite honestly, I hope Roblox in turn donates it to a children's charity to try to
2734140	2737500	undo some of the damage this guy is doing, although I'm not going to put that pressure
2737500	2741940	on Roblox because they probably have to pay more admins and so forth to deal with
2741940	2744580	this bullshit. And that is understandable.
2744580	2749940	But E3VL in chat says, isn't there a two digit number you can press to be unknown caller
2749940	2752300	ID? I remember someone doing that in high school.
2752300	2756420	There is. But my understanding is it's still like it's really easy to trace calls now.
2756540	2762860	Like that's why a lot of the phone pranking like stopped, like that is because even though
2762860	2767180	you can block caller ID, it is very easy to get the phone records and figure out who's
2767180	2768980	doing it and have that complaint or whatever.
2769300	2774220	Uh, your overrated face in chat, welcome, by the way, I think that's a new name, says
2774220	2775340	Star 66.
2775340	2778100	Yeah, I thought it was I actually thought it was Star 69.
2778260	2781220	Nice. I think Star 69 is the call back.
2781220	2782420	Yeah. Oh, that was OK.
2782420	2787500	Nice. But like Star 70 or something was the I know it was probably different on every
2787500	2788940	phone company and what have you.
2788940	2794460	So anyway. Yeah, folks, it just folks in chat are lighting at 62, 62, just depending on
2794460	2798220	where you live. Anyway, fuck this guy especially.
2798260	2803420	And fuck people that are doing these these pranks that are way over the line again,
2804140	2805700	memeing and dead by daylight.
2806940	2808420	Is your refrigerator running?
2808900	2813460	That's one thing, these things that this guy's doing completely another and for the
2813460	2814460	money and the YouTube.
2814580	2817860	Yeah, I also think it's a problem that YouTube is not shutting this person down.
2817860	2822460	Gross. But I guess let's make money off those seven hundred thousand accounts and
2822460	2825020	donate it to children. That would be a lovely resolution.
2826020	2833660	Yeah. Meanwhile, let's talk about what could have been, but what is not in less
2833660	2838820	serious news, this is something that could have been for a video game series, but is
2838820	2841020	not. And that is Mortal Kombat.
2841340	2848940	And apparently it was rumored that Keanu Reeves was supposed to make an appearance in
2848940	2853980	Mortal Kombat at some point, whether Neo from The Matrix or John Wick or whatever
2853980	2859340	happened. This was answered in a fan video with Esquire to talk about The Matrix for
2859780	2861740	somebody had asked this whole thing.
2861740	2866980	And Keanu said, if it was up to me, no, Mortal Kombat is awesome in so many ways.
2866980	2870700	But I think, you know, Neo, John Wick, yeah, man, they're doing their own thing.
2870900	2872740	Mortal Kombat's doing their own thing.
2872780	2877420	So people are kind of having that fantasy because it is Warner Brothers that
2877540	2879300	essentially owns both the license.
2879300	2880620	So it would be easy, I suppose.
2880860	2884420	But of course, you have to get the likeness of the actor less easy.
2884420	2888180	And there's also nothing out there that actually says this was ever in discussion.
2888180	2891420	It's probably just one of those rumors that was out there or what have you or, you know,
2891420	2894380	somebody took wouldn't this be cool to something further?
2894660	2898260	But I can also like I can understand, you know, Mortal Kombat 10, 11.
2898700	2900540	They are some pretty violent games.
2900540	2906260	And like if you're Keanu Reeves, do you want to really see Scorpion cutting your head off
2906260	2910020	and setting you on fire and peeing on you and whatever else they do?
2910180	2911980	In that case, do you really want to see that happen?
2911980	2914380	Your likeness? Probably not.
2914980	2921340	So I, I understand why there are many actors and actresses who would probably say, you
2921340	2924700	know, I think we'll pass on this one for this.
2925020	2931060	Now, you know, there were some characters like Freddy, Jason didn't like Freddy showed
2931060	2932420	up in Mortal Kombat nine.
2932420	2937860	Right. And then, yeah, like the predator is in one of like a lot of silly movie
2937860	2943340	characters are in them, but they're usually masked or they don't like look like the
2943340	2944580	actor or anything like that.
2945420	2949420	They don't let them like when it was Joker, they didn't let him shoot somebody.
2950340	2954420	That was probably the arrangement with DC Comics in that particular game, because that's
2954420	2956300	why they had the whole brutality thing.
2956300	2958420	And it wasn't like there were no fatalities.
2959140	2961900	Yeah, nobody wants to see Wonder Woman get decapitated.
2961900	2965140	That would be disgusting. So like it wouldn't have fit in that universe, you know.
2965420	2968740	So I think that's why the brutalities were a little better.
2968740	2972020	And at least, you know, with the Joker thing, it kind of went off camera.
2972020	2975220	So you never really knew, like, was it a joke?
2975220	2977020	Who knows? So anyway.
2979100	2980460	Yeah, let's see.
2982380	2985860	Some folks in chat are still talking about the prank stuff and the callback stuff.
2986100	2991460	E3VL is saying at least two times a week, someone wants to know about my car's extended
2991460	2993420	warranty. Oh, my God.
2993660	2997740	That is those those calls are out of control, as are the spam texts.
2997900	2999460	I get them. I kid you not.
2999460	3001140	Every day, every day.
3001140	3003260	OK, if you reply stop.
3004180	3009420	But then they know they know somebody's looking, I forward them to the thing, Rob.
3010100	3017580	They are legally required if you say stop to stop all further communications, it's like a
3017580	3018420	do not call list.
3018420	3019820	Where do I report that if they don't?
3020460	3022620	I'm serious because I'm so sick of these texts.
3023300	3025740	That would be the the FCC.
3027140	3032020	I've been forwarding them all to the AT&T has a number maybe folks don't know this, but
3032020	3033380	this is unique to AT&T.
3033380	3037540	I don't other carriers probably have a similar thing, but AT&T has seventy seven twenty
3037540	3041700	six, which is if you spell spam, you forward the message and then it says, thanks for
3041700	3043540	reporting this. What number did you get it from?
3043540	3045780	And then it says, thanks. We'll look into it.
3045860	3050260	Of course, nothing's happened, but I liked I like to feel like if I reported enough times,
3050260	3051180	something will happen.
3051380	3054940	So, well, sadly, that's not quite the case.
3055100	3056140	Yeah, no, I know. I know.
3056620	3060660	TigerCon chats is the problem with the spam calls that they are mostly recordings and you
3060660	3062500	hear those same recordings in different numbers.
3062500	3064740	Yeah, it's oof, oof, oof.
3064740	3068540	Whatever happened to that do not call list and all that, like make that shit go away.
3069820	3077180	The thing is, is that the do not call list tends to go, if I if I remember correctly, I
3077180	3079700	think it only applies to.
3082580	3083940	Like U.S.
3084340	3085940	telemarketing calls are for U.S.
3085940	3089260	companies. Oh, sure, because they can't legislate what happens elsewhere in the world, of
3089260	3093740	course, makes sense. Yeah, but with a lot of those, too, though, if you get those
3093740	3099940	marketing calls, if you listen long enough, they'll give you the do the opt out one and
3099940	3104700	they do remove you from their lists because I don't get them as much since I just waited
3104700	3106500	them out. Interesting.
3106580	3110140	And I was hanging up. Yeah, it is it is it is full on required.
3110140	3114340	I'm about to turn that thing on on my phone where it just simply doesn't ring if I don't
3114340	3116060	have the person listed as a contact.
3116300	3121340	Like I I used to have a Pixel phone and they used to have that.
3121620	3127220	I don't know why it's not just any Android phone, but they used to have it where Google
3127220	3131500	actually answer your phone for you to have like a robot, not really robot voice, but it's
3131500	3136460	like an AI voice that it's it screens your call for you and then it does like a voice
3136460	3139780	attacks to what the person's saying.
3139780	3143820	And so I used to do that all the time on my old phone and I got a new phone that
3144060	3146620	unfortunately wasn't a pixel because they didn't have them at the time.
3146620	3150900	And now it doesn't do that. And it's I miss that so much, but interesting.
3150900	3155740	Really wish that was something that they offered on other non pixel devices.
3156220	3157420	Interesting. All right.
3157420	3162660	Good to know. From Keanu Reeves to spam telephone calls, just another episode of Orange
3162660	3166980	Launch Radio. All right, let's move on to something I'm sure we're going to be slightly
3166980	3168740	passionate about. I don't know, dark soccer.
3168740	3170460	What do you think of this next one?
3170460	3171700	I'm pretty excited.
3171700	3175540	OK, I want to I want to believe I want to believe that's a good way to put I want to
3175540	3182260	believe. So there was supposed to have been a Mass Effect movie and it was canceled
3182260	3184260	because legendary pictures backed out of it.
3184860	3191740	You know, and basically Bioware was like, you know, we're we weren't going to be able to
3191740	3194540	tell the story in 90 to 120 minutes.
3195060	3202020	So basically now they are nearing a deal with Amazon to do a Mass Effect TV series,
3202540	3206340	which is pretty good because it's going to be coming on on the tail end of the expanse if
3206340	3212820	it happens. So it'll cover their sci fi gap once that other show is gone.
3213140	3219900	And I mean, hopefully it's going to be set in the prime universe and not the the Andromeda
3219900	3224700	universe. Or if they do anything, it might be some other new story, but at least we're
3224700	3226940	going to be getting some more Mass Effect from what it looks like.
3226940	3227900	I think it'll be awesome.
3228660	3232940	I I'm certainly on board with a Mass Effect TV series, but tell me what you think about
3232940	3235180	this dark soccer, because this might be the controversial point.
3235500	3238340	I really do not want them to do Shepard.
3238620	3243700	I think they would be I think they would be getting into some real dangerous territory if
3243700	3248420	they could. Number one, whoever they cast, the people that played the opposite gender
3248420	3253020	Shepard are going to be pissed like there is no there is no pleasing the fandom now.
3253300	3255180	They could we need a non-binary Shepard.
3256020	3257260	Fine. That's all.
3257780	3261500	Well, I mean, you also have Liara technically a non-binary race, but yes, fine.
3261500	3268180	Yes, of course. All that. However, I am fine with something parallel in that
3268220	3271900	same sort of like because I think it would actually be really cool if there was a
3271900	3275900	parallel story that wasn't Shepard, but somebody else.
3276060	3281780	And then that way you could have some of the other characters cross over like Liara
3281780	3285260	actually would be a great example, especially considering her lifespan.
3285540	3289780	You could you know, it could be a little bit after we get four, but we could have our
3289780	3295300	just a car. I mean, because I'm sure she she goes out in the makeup all the time.
3295300	3296540	I'm sure she'd happily do it.
3296620	3300460	Yeah, I think maybe a prequel would be all right, too.
3300460	3305020	But I just I just I just don't want them to try to tell the Shepard story in a TV
3305020	3308780	series. But I think there's ways they could do it where they could kind of go around
3308780	3311540	the Shepard thing and still do something very satisfying.
3311940	3313700	So I think so. Yeah.
3314780	3318340	And if you had a prequel, you could do something with both Kayden and Ashley to
3318340	3322700	not, you know, piss people and spoiler alert for a years old game.
3322940	3326300	But you could do something that, you know, would would please fans of both those
3326300	3330580	people. I just think maybe either a slight prequel like just before Shepard or
3330580	3333940	something excuse me, hiccups parallel would be perfect.
3334420	3338300	Or what if you have something about like a different side character, like maybe about
3338300	3342180	Vega? Oh, I love that idea.
3343100	3347460	Go be a writer for the show. I love that idea, because then, yes, a parallel character
3347460	3352460	who then intersects with everybody towards the climax of the
3352700	3354580	story. I think that's a great idea.
3355220	3358820	So, yeah, because, I mean, he seemed to have had an interesting life and, you know, he
3358820	3363260	was trying to get into, you know, the N7 program and all that.
3363260	3364460	I think it would be pretty neat.
3365940	3370420	Tyron College, actually, didn't they do an animated thing about Vega?
3370460	3372700	Yes, they did. And I have it and it was great.
3372860	3374260	Yeah. All right.
3374260	3375260	Now you're on to something.
3375500	3377660	They got, you know, Freddie Prinze Jr.
3377660	3380460	to do all the vocalizations.
3381460	3386460	I would say maybe he could play Vega, but I guess he's he's kind of he's older than we are.
3386460	3388060	He's not the right build. Yeah, he's not.
3388060	3389740	He's nice getting a little older, too.
3389820	3391940	I think he's dad bought it out a little bit, too.
3391980	3392980	Yeah, yeah.
3393780	3395260	Vega's built like a tank.
3395660	3400460	Tyron Chad over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says Mass Effect as a TV show makes
3400460	3403420	sense because it's such a huge universe with a ton of world building.
3403580	3407020	And for a show like this to work, they could just have a new character that you follow.
3407140	3409580	And this character could be a new recruit in the Normandy.
3409780	3413620	You could tell the stories from the game, from another character's point of view.
3413620	3415900	I think that's the way to do it.
3415900	3418380	Tell the stories from another character's point of view.
3418500	3423020	And then you can see all the same types of places like the Citadel absolutely has to be it.
3423860	3429740	It would have to not be, though, anything with the Normandy or Shepard specifically.
3429780	3437660	Yeah, but there's there's a lot of gaps you could fill, like a lot happens between one and two.
3437820	3443420	Why not set a TV show to help explain the events of what happens between one and two when
3443420	3445260	Shepard is out of commission, so to speak?
3446180	3452060	You know, I've already had like stuff written in the background, you know, so they should just
3452060	3454260	totally they should hire me to write for them.
3454780	3457140	I'd be good. I would I would love to.
3457180	3460380	So I just I do not want them better than writing fan fiction.
3461220	3464420	If they cast I write a treatment, they script it.
3465100	3470900	If they cast John or Jane Shepard or whatever the default names are, if they cast those if they
3470900	3474740	cast a John or a Jane Shepard, I'm I'm going to be really upset.
3474900	3478620	I don't want them to try to tell that exact same story.
3478820	3484340	But so all these ideas about a side universe, a side story, a tangential thing are great.
3485140	3489980	What if they did do something like a.
3491060	3492180	Andromeda ish.
3492180	3499620	I'd be I'd actually be really super OK with an Andromeda ish story, even if it's not like
3499620	3503700	those care, finally give us the story of the Korean arc, although that would be a really
3503700	3505140	weird place to start a TV series.
3505140	3506580	I think they did that book, didn't they?
3506580	3509340	Yeah, they did. You're right. But I get that book.
3509340	3516020	The idea of maybe another universe, another galaxy in that same thing, you it would basically
3516020	3517220	be Star Trek, Voyager.
3517220	3521660	And I'm totally OK with that, like, but with Mass Effect, people would be amazing, I think.
3522660	3526020	Or what about post-war?
3527460	3530900	Yeah, and they they get the mass relays working.
3532260	3537100	Or a group gets thrown out with, you know, if you're going to take the whole Voyager
3537100	3541380	thing, a ship gets thrown out via mass relay at the end of everything.
3542180	3547540	Any of these ideas I am more than OK with, just please do not write fanfiction.
3547540	3548820	I have ideas. I know.
3548820	3551980	I know. Please do not tell the stories of the games.
3553180	3557980	If they tried to retell Andromeda story, I wouldn't be as mad, but I just that would be
3557980	3559420	such a weird place for them to start.
3560060	3564860	It would just remove the whole thing that the game is choice.
3564860	3570300	I think they have to start with a prequel or something between one and two because they
3570300	3571900	have to establish the story.
3571900	3574780	There's going to be people that watch this that have never played the games.
3575580	3578300	I really don't think they're going to be able to just pick it up in the middle.
3579340	3580140	So we'll see.
3580700	3588380	Anyway, oh, I don't hate this idea from Tiger Claw, a Deep Space Nine type of show taking
3588380	3589620	place in the Citadel.
3590060	3593580	I don't hate. Yeah, the Citadel had a lot of great stories with it.
3593740	3598220	And there's a lot of really interesting kind of relationships and things that I and there
3598220	3600540	could be interludes at this one's intimate apparel.
3600660	3605580	Yeah, you can go you can go right for them to.
3605580	3607860	Yeah, I'm you know about that, right?
3608180	3611300	Oh, of course, I found that on my fly cam.
3611380	3614740	Yeah, yeah, this one's intimate apparel.
3614820	3616740	I'm Hannah Lingerie shop.
3616740	3620100	I'm sure somebody put it in as a joke thinking nobody would find it.
3620100	3622100	And then people find shit.
3622100	3623220	People find it, of course.
3623700	3625540	All right, let's move on.
3625540	3630820	More stories to tell while we await the casting of Shepard and get very disappointed.
3631220	3632340	But we're going to hold out hope.
3632340	3637780	Meanwhile, Loki, what's on our next story now for a different type of disappointment?
3637860	3642340	So and now something completely different.
3642900	3648900	Nintendo has now commented on the whole Activision harassment stories, basically saying that
3648900	3650900	they are distressing and disturbing.
3652180	3656500	You know, Doug Bowser said addressing the whole thing.
3656500	3660580	Along with all of you, I've been following the latest developments with Activision Blizzard
3660580	3664660	and the ongoing reports of sexual harassment and toxicity at the company.
3664660	3667460	I find all of these accounts distressing and disturbing.
3667460	3672340	They run counter to my values as well as the Nintendo's police values and policies.
3672340	3673940	I mean, yeah, it's pretty basic.
3676660	3682340	Still, really get more still, Loki, you know, you fucked up when Bowser's looking at you
3682340	3684740	going, man, that's pretty fucked up.
3685700	3692820	Yeah, so and then to kind of respond to all of these things, Activision Blizzard is forming
3692820	3699060	a workplace responsibility committee that are led by two of the current members of their
3699060	3699460	board.
3700180	3704820	The committee will require management to develop key performance indicators and other means
3704820	3707460	of measure progress and ensure accountability.
3707460	3712580	The chief executive officer, Bobby Kotick, along with the chief people officer and chief
3712580	3716580	compliance officer, will provide frequent progress reports to the committee.
3716580	3720020	The committee will be investigating themselves, apparently.
3720980	3722340	So literally.
3723540	3725300	The worst solution possible.
3725300	3727860	We've investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing.
3729300	3731860	Bobby Kotick's firing is long overdue.
3731860	3732500	Pass it on.
3733540	3737700	Like, that's that's I, I am thankful in all seriousness with my Bowser comment.
3737700	3740260	I'm very thankful to Doug Bowser for speaking up.
3740980	3745380	I'm thankful to all of the game companies for speaking up because that is going to really
3745380	3746980	put that pressure on Activision.
3747380	3750340	I we've been doing this shit for 19 years.
3750340	3752900	I I can't recall a time.
3752900	3755940	Granted, I couldn't remember who harmonics really was earlier in the show.
3755940	3765140	However, I cannot recall a time when Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all come together
3765700	3767860	to say this is an issue.
3770660	3770900	Yeah.
3772820	3773220	Yesh.
3774020	3778740	Uh, Mike Defton chat says that's what happened in riot.
3778740	3779140	Oh, yeah.
3779140	3783540	The establishing the committee that's made up of the people that need to have oversight.
3783540	3785140	Yeah, it's just boy.
3785140	3788580	Uh, E3VL in chat says we just need Steam and Valve to get on board.
3788580	3791620	You know, I didn't even think about that because I was really honed in on the console.
3791620	3792100	But you're right.
3792100	3795060	Activision games are sold on the Steam platform.
3795060	3797700	So it would be nice for Steam to make a comment.
3798260	3804500	However, at this point, just simply all three console manufacturers identifying that there
3804500	3811380	is a problem, I'm I'm very glad to those executives for stepping up and saying what needed to
3811380	3814580	be said publicly when it is a business risk.
3814580	3815220	Let's be real.
3815940	3816980	It is a business risk.
3816980	3819940	Anyway, Bobby Kotick's resignation is long overdue.
3819940	3821300	Let's all hope tomorrow's the day.
3822500	3826100	Meanwhile, I hope by the time you all hear this podcast, he's gone.
3826100	3829300	I really, really do, because I would like to talk about that company's products again.
3830100	3832820	But meanwhile, we'll talk about Atari.
3834020	3836100	How about we talk about Atari instead?
3836100	3838980	Well, you know, Atari, Atari's done some interesting things.
3838980	3841460	Well, and also Atari isn't Atari anymore.
3841460	3847220	You know what Infogrames bought Atari some years ago and Atari's Atari's done some cool
3847220	3848740	things, I guess, like the hotel.
3848740	3851700	I actually think is very interesting, although I've yet to really see one.
3851700	3853300	But I find that interesting.
3853300	3857860	And Atari's done some things that are not so interesting, like the VCS that oof, oof,
3857860	3858360	oof.
3858820	3863060	Well, yeah, it sounded cool at the beginning, and then it just got less interesting as it
3863060	3863540	went on.
3863540	3867460	Yeah, well, Atari's made some very interesting moves this week.
3868020	3870260	Atari is purchasing Moby Games.
3871380	3875780	It's going for 1.5 million and I guess they're going to be taking over what early next year
3875780	3876820	or something like that.
3876820	3882660	Moby Games is a site that I guess if you want to sum it up, it's kind of like an IMDB for
3882660	3885380	games has a lot of that sort of stuff.
3885380	3891940	And actually, ironically, one thing I noticed is that Moby does document the older games
3891940	3896260	of the Atari 2600 era in television, Commodore.
3896260	3898180	It documents a lot of that stuff pretty well.
3898180	3903540	Like I will try to find obscure Commodore 64 games that maybe there's a YouTube or two
3903540	3905140	because, you know, there's a lot on YouTube now.
3905140	3909620	But literally the only websites that have information is like Moby Games.
3909620	3911700	So they do have a pretty impressive database.
3911700	3916500	And I guess I see where that's to Atari's benefit because Atari is a retro company as
3916500	3917140	well.
3917140	3922260	And perhaps this is something that's a tie in to what we talked about last week or the
3922260	3928020	week before where Atari is doing the limited running game.
3928020	3930340	I just want to say limited run games, but that's another company.
3930340	3931460	But y'all know what I mean.
3931460	3934500	They're doing that kind of like limited publishing thing on their side.
3934500	3937300	I could see why maybe they want to tie it into this.
3937300	3943380	Of course, if I'm a Moby Games super user of which that site is very user driven, it's
3943380	3948980	Wikipedia-esque in that regard, I can see where I'm kind of freaked out by this idea
3948980	3955460	because this already happened to them before when Gamefly bought them at one point, changed
3955460	3959060	everything, and then Blue Flame Labs bought them and changed it back.
3959060	3964820	So if I am somebody who spent many volunteer hours helping to keep Moby Games be a great
3964820	3967620	website, I'm concerned about this sale.
3967620	3968820	And I get this a little bit.
3970100	3973380	Quest Buster in chat says Moby Games is such a great resource.
3973380	3975620	I found a lot of esoteric games there.
3975620	3980420	There's also Atari Age out there, which focuses exclusively on Atari releases, trading and
3980420	3980980	preservation.
3980980	3983460	But as far as I know, the new Atari doesn't own them.
3984180	3989380	Bobby Blackwolf wants to point out, I have a Moby Games profile for my one game credit.
3989380	3991220	Somebody made a Moby Games for Flappy Vogue?
3992980	3993540	I'm just kidding.
3994260	4000740	Bobby did a soundtrack for a Tetris flavored game in the 90s, so you can find more out
4000740	4004100	about that on his show, which I've never played, oddly enough.
4004100	4005300	I want to stream it sometime.
4007140	4010820	It probably doesn't even run on modern PCs without, like, DOSBox or something.
4010820	4014100	SSG100 Matt does point out no pixel poops on Moby Games.
4014660	4016660	Matt, it's a user-driven site.
4016660	4018180	Somebody just has to add it.
4018180	4019060	Loki, where are you at?
4019060	4024420	Didn't you add it somewhere else so it could get scooped up by...
4025860	4029700	It's on the game database.
4029700	4030500	That's tied with Twitch.
4030500	4032900	Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.
4032900	4034180	Game database for Twitch.
4034180	4035460	So, all right.
4036500	4039140	That's actually not where things end.
4039140	4044260	Atari has also mentioned they've invested half a million in the streaming retro platform
4044260	4045300	AntStream.
4045300	4047140	I've talked about AntStream on this program.
4047140	4048820	I used to be a subscriber.
4048820	4050900	I was a backer of the Kickstarter.
4050900	4052340	I actually no longer am.
4052980	4054580	I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
4054580	4056820	It's not really shade against AntStream.
4056820	4057780	I'm going to explain why in a minute.
4058500	4060580	In the quote, Atari says,
4060580	4065140	the investment in AntStream Limited was made pursuant to a convertible loan agreement that
4065140	4069620	can be converted into equity of AntStream Limited in a future financing with an initial
4069620	4071300	investment of $500,000.
4073220	4075940	This is not the first time Atari and AntStream have partnered up.
4075940	4082900	AntStream is one of the few things that's actually on the VCS where I believe a much
4082900	4090420	larger Atari library is playable on AntStream if you are streaming it from an Atari VCS.
4090420	4096340	If you are not and you're on the PC platform, you have a very limited amount of Atari games
4096340	4100340	and they add maybe one a week, but sometimes they're deep cuts.
4101060	4103220	So it's been a little slow to catch up.
4104180	4106180	So I mentioned I used to be on AntStream.
4106180	4107380	Why did I stop?
4107380	4111300	Quite simply, they mysteriously stopped supporting Xbox.
4111860	4115540	There is a client for Xbox One that exists.
4115540	4117940	There is no client for Xbox Series X.
4120340	4124980	I have been a fan of AntStream as far as like, you know, I think the cloud-based stuff for
4124980	4128020	retro gaming and I do want to support it from a legal perspective.
4128020	4128980	I think it's interesting.
4128980	4132820	I actually kind of liked that it's a European-based company.
4132980	4135540	So a lot of stuff is from a European perspective.
4135540	4137220	There's a very heavy MSX.
4138180	4140180	I'm sorry, not MSX.
4140180	4141380	The other one, ZX Spectrum.
4141380	4142340	The other one you couldn't get here.
4142340	4146820	ZX Spectrum is very heavily on AntStream, which makes sense.
4146820	4149540	And a lot of Commodore classics, which you know I love.
4149540	4151860	I don't even think you can get on.
4151860	4155300	Chat, correct me if I'm wrong, but for a long time you couldn't even get on AntStream if
4155300	4155940	you were in the US.
4155940	4157620	You had to be a Kickstarter backer, right?
4157620	4161780	But maybe they, Dark Tetsuya said ever since they went free to play, he was able to get
4161780	4161940	on it.
4161940	4163220	So maybe that changed.
4163220	4163540	Sorry.
4165780	4169780	But yeah, that's why I stopped with AntStream.
4169780	4173380	Like the PC thing is cool, I guess, but I want to be able to play on my Xbox.
4173380	4178100	And I thought it was really weird because when the Kickstarter happened, they said they
4178100	4179460	were going to do PlayStation.
4179460	4181620	They had a stretch goal for PlayStation.
4181620	4183940	I want to say they had a stretch goal for Switch too.
4183940	4184900	I might be wrong.
4184900	4186580	It's been a few years since I backed it.
4187460	4190660	And the Xbox as well is supposed to be a thing.
4190660	4196020	And as far as I'm concerned, as long as they continue to work on these Atari clients and
4196020	4200740	they're not delivering on these earlier promises, they're in violation of that Kickstarter
4200740	4202260	agreement as far as I'm concerned.
4202260	4206740	And that's why I have no longer extended my subscription with them.
4206740	4212420	But that aside, I do mostly have positive things to say about the platform.
4212420	4214100	I want to see it succeed.
4214100	4218500	I have concerns if it will under Atari's watch, but Atari didn't buy them.
4218500	4220980	It just looks like Atari's got a lot of money in them.
4221620	4222740	But so, yeah.
4223380	4225540	Dr. Tetsuya in chat says, oh, that was my tweet.
4225540	4228820	Yeah, I'm actually digging the vast arcade library and the leaderboards and challenges
4228820	4229380	are fun too.
4230020	4234580	Pistol pockets in chat says, from what I know, Anstream actually owns Moby Games now, which
4234580	4237540	is why Atari may use the option to purchase Moby Games.
4237540	4239300	I'm not sure where that comes from.
4239300	4243140	I believe Blue Flames, something it's called, is the one that owns Moby Games.
4243140	4247220	I think this is just this particular press release getting jumbled a little bit.
4247220	4251940	I think, and I could, again, I didn't remember who Harmonics was at the beginning of the
4251940	4254100	show, so it's very possible I'm in the wrong.
4254100	4259540	But I am looking at an article that says the current owner is Blue Flame Labs.
4259540	4260740	So just for the record.
4261860	4264740	Oh, oh, OK.
4264740	4265220	Thank you.
4265220	4266980	Pixel pockets is clarifying.
4266980	4273140	Blue Flame Labs LLC closed a year ago and Moby Games Limited was created with owners
4273140	4274580	from Anstream.
4274580	4279220	I was confused as well and looked into it and asked people on the Moby Games Discord.
4279780	4285620	Oh, well, thank you, because that clearly is research I did not do.
4285620	4287300	And that explains a lot.
4287300	4290820	So, huh, that is fascinating.
4292900	4298340	Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, I can only hope that Atari leaves Moby Games as is, as
4298340	4301140	last time one of the buyers redesigned the site years ago.
4301140	4304180	Yeah, I think it was Gamefly.
4304180	4307620	It actually destroyed a lot of its ease of use before it was reverted back under new
4307620	4308420	owners.
4308420	4311060	That is really interesting what Pixel pockets said, huh?
4312420	4314500	Why would Anstream want Moby Games?
4316340	4318740	Unless, you know what?
4320740	4322980	I'm going to just fire a crazy idea out there.
4324260	4328740	What if the idea with Moby Games is to make it so that you look up the old games and then
4328740	4331860	you play it right there on your browser with Anstream technology?
4335060	4337460	I think that's the future right there.
4337460	4340260	But again, I'm still waiting on my PlayStation and Xbox clients.
4340260	4340820	I was promised.
4341380	4344100	All right, let's move on.
4344100	4345780	More retro goodness, right, DarkSakura?
4346340	4349780	Yep, we have some goodies from Taito.
4349780	4356020	The Taito milestones that was announced for Japan is going to be coming out in the US.
4356900	4361780	It's due in Japan on February 2022.
4362580	4369140	It will be including Kix, which makes me happy, Alpine Ski, Frontline, Wild Western,
4369700	4374980	Jack and Pop, Elevator Action, the Fairyland story.
4374980	4375940	Fairyland story is fun.
4376740	4383460	Hailey's Comet, the Ninja Warriors, which, you know, we got on SNES back in the day and
4384340	4385700	Arcade and whatnot.
4385700	4390740	And there's another 10th game to come out that has yet to be announced.
4391860	4398020	There will be limited and collector's editions for Strictly Limited Games Partner Store
4398020	4402500	on November 25th, which is already.
4403620	4408580	And then, of course, there will be a standard that's for the standard edition and the
4408580	4414900	collector's edition will be limited to 2,000 copies and the limited will be limited to
4414900	4416020	3,000 copies.
4417380	4417940	So there you go.
4418820	4423060	That's a neat little collection, though, because you've got some big names in there
4423060	4426340	like Kix, but there's a lot of more obscure titles in there, which is pretty cool.
4426340	4429860	So it's just more stuff that wasn't really big over here.
4429860	4431460	Yeah, but I think it's still really neat.
4431460	4432180	So, yeah.
4432980	4433300	All right.
4433860	4436020	You know, I can play Kix for like all day.
4436020	4436580	Oh, I know.
4436580	4436900	I know.
4436900	4438660	Kix is a real fun one.
4440820	4441700	Excuse me.
4441700	4443220	Yyr is in our chat.
4443220	4449380	Hey, who says, sounds like this is releasing alongside the Taito mini arcade cabinet, which
4449380	4450900	is also due in February.
4450900	4451460	That's right.
4451460	4456020	I remember a story on that Taito cabinet does make a lot of sense for that all to come out.
4456020	4456260	Good.
4456260	4456500	Good.
4457060	4457380	All right.
4457940	4459060	What can I say, folks?
4459060	4463060	It's a slower news week, so we let in a few more rumors.
4463060	4467940	But, Loki, this is a rumor that's kind of coming back, right?
4467940	4470020	I'm only interested in one rumors.
4470420	4471460	Fleetwood Mac.
4471460	4473860	Oh, I was going to say the single from Lindsay Lohan.
4473860	4474260	Close.
4474260	4474420	No.
4476580	4477700	Fleetwood Mac.
4477700	4482660	So apparently there's a rumor that Chrono Cross is getting a remake.
4484100	4491300	This was based off of a leak list that was on the, was it Nvidia?
4492820	4497940	And then there was also some other stuff that was coming from that as well.
4498420	4505780	Basically saying now that I hear there's the JRPG and multi-platform, I assume PC, PlayStation,
4505780	4506340	Switch.
4506340	4507380	That's my assumption.
4508180	4510500	That's not what I was told, but that's just my assumption.
4511060	4513300	So I don't know.
4513300	4514420	It's a lot of rumors.
4515460	4522020	And this is, I guess, coming from as well, like a co-founder, Nick Baker of Xbox era
4522020	4523060	podcast.
4523060	4532420	I'm not really sure how he's affiliated with the Nvidia database leak, but I guess we'll
4532420	4533220	wait and see.
4533860	4537140	Well, what's interesting about this too, is it's not the first time this has come around.
4537140	4539700	I remember this was brought up on another show a few months ago.
4540500	4545140	And on one hand, it does make a lot of sense because, you know, you have that team that
4545140	4548820	did the Secret of Mana reboot and they did the Tales of Mana.
4548820	4554260	And that was huge, or Trials, excuse me, of Mana, because, you know, that's the Tales
4554260	4558660	of is a completely different series, sorry, Trials of Mana, which, you know, that was
4558660	4562340	huge because we actually got that game for the first time in the US and all that good
4562340	4562840	stuff.
4564260	4565380	What are they working on now?
4565940	4569220	You know, you would have to imagine they're probably remaking another.
4569220	4572900	Well, and then they also did, I'm sorry, they did Legend of Mana, the one I like to forget
4572900	4573620	about.
4573620	4574820	That also got remade.
4574820	4579860	So it does make sense that, you know, Chrono Cross seems kind of like a target game to
4579860	4580980	get a remake.
4580980	4587140	I'm sure a lot of people are wondering, why won't they touch Chrono Trigger and the big
4587140	4587940	one?
4587940	4590020	I think there might be hesitation.
4590020	4591380	I think it's twofold.
4591380	4598100	I think there might be hesitation that if they fuck it up, it's going to be disastrous
4598100	4601540	because a lot of people hold that game in very, very high regard.
4601540	4603220	And I just do a third game.
4604100	4604600	Right?
4604600	4609140	I think that's a brilliant answer as well is just make a third game.
4609780	4615220	The other thing with Chrono Trigger, I think the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters, I think
4615220	4616660	are the true test for that.
4616660	4621220	I think they're going to gauge how those Pixel remasters do and potentially do a Chrono Trigger
4621220	4625700	one with that if those Final Fantasy remasters do well.
4625700	4627380	So can I throw out something?
4627380	4627940	Sure, please.
4628660	4629940	Speaking of Chrono Trigger.
4629940	4630440	Yeah.
4630840	4635240	So, you know, I was in Alabama for my friend's funeral, right?
4636360	4643960	One of the last messages that my friend sent me, and I'll have to have to read it, was
4645240	4649720	I see a girl with her Nintendo playing Chrono Trigger while you made me love that game.
4650760	4652600	Oh, that's a great memory.
4652600	4653240	I love that.
4653240	4653800	Yeah.
4653800	4655800	So I have special memories of that game.
4655800	4658040	And if they fuck it up, I will be livid.
4658760	4661880	And I think there probably is some of that.
4661880	4669480	I mean, if you fuck up Chrono Cross, you know, like, I'm not like, you know, it'll be all
4669480	4669800	right.
4669800	4673800	You know, that game kind of a lot of people passed on it when it first came out.
4673800	4676840	But I think you cannot fuck up Chrono Trigger.
4676840	4680040	And I think exactly for that reason and many reasons.
4680040	4685320	But again, I think they'll go the Pixel remaster route, assuming the Final Fantasy one through
4685320	4688120	six remasters do well, which it seems like they've been doing all right.
4688120	4691960	I don't know how they're selling, but it seems like the reception to that I should see if
4691960	4693560	they're on sale this weekend.
4693560	4694120	Probably not.
4694120	4699400	But you never know because I still haven't picked them up because I'm being stubborn.
4699400	4704200	I'm making them release it on Switch or PlayStation or Xbox would be great, too, before I pick
4704200	4704760	it up.
4704760	4705880	That's for sure.
4705880	4709400	I don't know why people are saying Chrono Cross wasn't that good because a lot of people
4709400	4709800	love it.
4710600	4714440	Yeah, I think it's a lot of people who absolutely love that game.
4714440	4716040	It's like Legend of Mana, too.
4716040	4717880	I think Legend of Mana stinks.
4717880	4720360	I know other people that think it's amazing.
4720360	4722040	So it's those PlayStation.
4722040	4722920	It's all a matter of taste.
4722920	4725320	Don't say that something sucks when someone else might like it.
4726520	4729640	So I mean, unless it has to do with racism or something that sucks.
4730440	4731480	Racism always sucks.
4731480	4731980	All right.
4733640	4734600	Okay, one more story.
4734600	4736760	And this comes from our Discord.
4736760	4740840	So thank you for everybody who is participating in our Discord.
4740840	4743080	And if you're not there yet, why don't you join?
4743080	4744520	vognetwork.com.
4744520	4746760	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4746760	4751160	We'll get you in our Discord and folks post stories for us to talk about, such as this
4751160	4758520	one, which is about a Sony patent that indicates Sony is getting back into mobile.
4759480	4760760	Not maybe in the way you think.
4761720	4766600	Apparently, the patent is for Sony Interactive Entertainment and is patenting a PlayStation
4766600	4769160	controller that's designed for mobile gaming.
4769960	4774360	It was published by Sony Interactive's Japanese division, and it talks about playing games
4774360	4776920	on a device coupled with two controller grips.
4777800	4783240	The controller looks a little bit like a DualShock 4, not so much a PlayStation 5, but it's
4783240	4787880	literally like a left side grip and a right side grip that your phone kind of goes in
4787880	4788600	the center of.
4789640	4794920	The drawings that are around out there also have a shaft portion that can be tilted by
4794920	4798040	the user and it can kind of sense the tilting direction.
4798040	4801080	I wonder if that's a PlayStation 3 six axis thing.
4801080	4801400	I don't know.
4801400	4804200	I'm just like, it's a very random, but I wonder if that's like a weird thing.
4805880	4807080	What could this all be about?
4809240	4810760	Here's my thought on this.
4812120	4817720	You know, I think it's probably really about trying to expand PlayStation Now and cloud
4817720	4822440	gaming to mobile, because right now, you know, that's all on Sony devices.
4822440	4826840	I would think this is something they're going to look to expand to mobile, whether that
4826840	4831480	be through the web, because I know there's been like with Apple, it's been, you know,
4831480	4833800	they don't like to have the cloud services on there.
4834920	4837080	So it just kind of depends.
4837080	4840920	I could go a lot of different directions or maybe it'll stream from your PlayStation.
4840920	4841720	Who fucking knows?
4841720	4843400	It could go many different ways.
4843400	4848760	But I think I would think this is them trying to get PlayStation Now and their cloud gaming
4849320	4854200	onto mobile devices and using this controller to do that.
4855000	4859160	And for all I know, honestly, PlayStation Now is probably already on mobile, but it just
4859160	4862280	shows you how much I actually use that service, because I'm going to be honest, there's not
4862280	4863960	a lot of compelling stuff on it for me.
4864760	4867960	The library isn't quite expansive enough, but maybe they're going to do another push
4867960	4868200	on it.
4868200	4868680	Who knows?
4869640	4874200	So maybe they'll put Chrono Cross on it and Legend of Mana and we'll have reasons to
4874840	4875880	visit it and pick it up again.
4875880	4880200	But I really my gut tells me this is about cloud gaming.
4880200	4885880	And I think the people that are taking this to a PSP or PlayStation Vita type of place,
4886680	4890200	unless you're talking about it streaming from the cloud, I don't think you're right,
4890200	4891240	respectfully.
4891240	4894600	I think this is literally something that's going to hold the phone that lets you play
4894600	4896840	cloud gaming and encourages you to keep a PlayStation.
4897480	4901080	It would be neat if it actually streamed from your PlayStation 5, though, kind of like what
4902760	4905160	Microsoft's doing with X cloud and all that stuff.
4905800	4906600	That'd be kind of cool.
4907560	4909480	All right, let's move on.
4909480	4915000	Let's go back to a simpler time before we had all this cloud gaming in our next segment.
4915000	4915800	Here comes the bump.
4927400	4932920	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4932920	4935160	out a classic and tell you about it.
4935160	4937880	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4938760	4940680	And what did you pick for us tonight, Darzaka?
4941560	4943240	I picked Pinball FX.
4943240	4943720	Good pick.
4945480	4950360	Pinball FX is a video game to emulate pinball tables.
4950360	4956120	It came out on Xbox 360, developed by Zen Studios, published by Microsoft Game Studios
4956120	4958040	on April 25th, 2007.
4959240	4965880	It was first released via Xbox Live Arcade, and it had three tables with six more downloadable
4966200	4968520	tables and later boards and online multiplayer.
4968520	4969960	And it did, of course, have sequels.
4971400	4974280	It kind of got mixed reviews.
4974280	4977560	It was about the upper level of average.
4977560	4986040	They said the physics were really good, but they didn't really care for multiplayer with
4986040	4990440	it being split screen, although some people were happy that it was there.
4990440	4997480	And as of July 28th, 2010, it sold over 362,000 copies.
4999960	5002040	It was followed by Pinball FX 2.
5004120	5009800	It was delisted after Pinball FX 2 came out, but all of the purchases carried over to Pinball
5009800	5010520	FX 2.
5012600	5018920	However, the corresponding tables were not available on the Xbox One version of Pinball
5018920	5024520	FX 2, but because it is backwards compatible, you can have it installed.
5026520	5032440	It basically uses the same rules as a pinball table in a virtual environment.
5033320	5042040	You have your ball on the play field, and you smack it around with your flippers, and
5042040	5047800	you run it into the bumpers, and you hit ramps, and you do all of the stuff that you do in
5047800	5048920	an actual pinball table.
5049640	5053160	You have leaderboards, online multiplayer for up to four players.
5055480	5062120	You win multiplayer by high score, and it came with three tables.
5062120	5065240	Starting off, we had Speed Machine, which was a racing theme.
5065240	5069880	We had Extreme, which is a skateboarding theme, and Agents, which were secret agents and spies.
5070520	5078520	There was a fourth one called Buccaneer that was released October 31st, 2007 as a free
5078520	5089240	download, and then five additional paid ones that had some licensed content on there.
5090600	5095160	There was Nightmare Mansion, which was sort of a horror movie one, and then there was
5095320	5097720	Rocky and Bullwinkle.
5098840	5105480	There was Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Earth Defense, which was Alien Invasion, and then the fifth
5105480	5110200	one Excalibur, which was based off of King Arthur.
5112680	5118040	Because of the feedback for Pinball FX, then that went into Pinball FX 2.
5120200	5123320	Like I said, the first one was a pretty mixed bag.
5124040	5131560	A lot of people really liked it as a pinball engine, even going so far to compare it to
5133000	5139560	Pinball Dreams, which was a pinball sim by Digital Illusions that came out for the Amiga
5139560	5140600	in 1992.
5140600	5143160	It was one of the big ones at the time.
5143160	5143640	So good.
5145080	5150120	Just saying, so good, Pinball Dreams, and that was one of the games I really enjoyed
5150120	5152200	playing on Antstream when I had it, actually.
5153000	5153720	Ironically enough.
5157560	5168520	But the thing that I think Pinball FX really set the stage for was now things like Zen
5168520	5175240	Pinball and all of the other online pinball we have that's allowing those licensed tables
5175240	5175400	in.
5176200	5179320	For the longest time, we had Pin Maim.
5181480	5186680	And with all the virtual tables, those were very much a labor of love by fans.
5187560	5197560	But this was one that kind of brought it back into the eye of the home gamer.
5198040	5206920	And I think that that really, I mean, as a pinball fan, I think that these virtual versions
5206920	5212680	might have brought just the art and fun of pinball back to people and make them want
5212680	5214120	to check out the real thing.
5217000	5217720	That's my theory.
5220440	5227480	Because now you can't go to a real barcade without having more pinball hanging around.
5227560	5233320	And more and more collectors getting into actual pinball tables and so forth.
5233320	5237560	And I think maybe, you know, these games, we just got our Ghostbusters back.
5237560	5238680	Oh, that's awesome.
5240040	5240360	Yeah.
5241640	5250040	But I mean, and if I was going to touch on Pinball FX 2, which honestly, I could have
5250040	5254920	also done that as a classic game, but it brought in.
5254920	5260040	I mean, like all kinds of different, like there was a portal.
5260680	5262200	There were Marvel ones.
5263160	5265160	There was a lot of Marvel ones.
5265160	5266360	There was Star Wars.
5266360	5273720	There was, Alien vs Pinball was another series that was pretty neat.
5273720	5275320	I mean, it really opened it up.
5275320	5283640	And I honestly, now while I still prefer to play a physical table, it's not bad.
5284200	5285080	It's really not bad.
5287480	5288040	I am down.
5289160	5291080	When it's impossible to find the table.
5291080	5292120	It's a good pinch.
5293320	5293560	Yeah.
5296440	5300840	You know, if you don't feel like standing up either, you know, there's that is something
5300840	5303640	you can play from your couch and still kind of get some of the same fun.
5304200	5305800	But I will agree.
5305800	5307720	The physics are amazing.
5308760	5309720	The physics are great.
5310600	5311640	But there you go.
5311640	5313400	That's our game Pinball FX.
5313640	5318200	For Xbox Live Arcade, for Xbox 360.
5319240	5321080	Lots of people in chat commenting on this.
5321080	5322040	Let me get some of these.
5322040	5325560	Mike Deft in chat says, wait, Pinball FX is over 10 years old.
5325560	5327800	It's almost 15, believe it or not.
5328440	5331880	It's one of those things that'll age as a gamer.
5331880	5332440	That's for sure.
5333640	5337480	Dark Tetsuya says, I have a few of the tables that they gave away in FX3, so I played around
5337480	5338120	with it a little bit.
5338120	5338760	It was kind of fun.
5339560	5343960	She Hulk 10 in chat says, the game is awesome and it is an excellent simulator.
5343960	5347800	And if you buy all the DLC, it's like having 100 pinball machines in your home.
5347800	5349560	Great for preservation as well.
5350200	5352600	You can also learn how to play the tables as well.
5352600	5355240	It has tutorials for actual physical tables.
5355240	5359480	You know, that's a great point that She Hulk puts out there because, you know, now that
5360120	5364200	Pinball FX has the licenses and they're doing, you know, especially in FX3, you have a lot
5364200	5365400	of like licensed tables.
5365880	5370600	It gives you those instructions that you don't always have when you walk into the bar, right?
5370600	5371880	I mean, everybody kind of just knows how to play pinball.
5371880	5377320	It's the opportunity to learn the rule set, to learn how to get to the wizard modes, for
5377320	5377720	example.
5377720	5384040	Because there are some games, like we were, when we were doing Friendsgiving, one of Dan's
5384040	5388680	buddies was saying that he just discovered like one of the wizard modes in the new Jurassic
5388680	5390200	Park, the newer Jurassic Park.
5390200	5390760	Yeah.
5390760	5393000	I was like, I didn't know this was in here.
5393000	5394840	It's a way to really study the game.
5394840	5396840	I think would be a really good way to put it.
5396840	5401320	You could really go that next layer deeper than you can in a noisy bar playing a dollar
5401320	5405800	a game, which is a great way to play pinball too, but, um, and, and really study the game.
5405800	5406840	And I think that's pretty cool.
5407400	5411160	It's also a good way to find some of those obscure tables that you just don't see out
5411160	5411720	in the wild.
5411720	5412280	Yeah.
5412280	5413160	Yeah, for sure.
5413160	5416520	I mean, I mean, that's the newer ones, of course, but I mean, we have to look at where
5416520	5417560	it started.
5417560	5422200	I thought I saw something about like Pinball FX is kind of like rebranding or, I mean,
5422200	5422920	they're rebooting.
5422920	5427560	They're going back to the not Pinball FX 4, but like a Pinball FX that I think is coming
5427560	5428200	out next year.
5428200	5432040	I thought I saw something about that floating around somewhere, um, which makes sense.
5432040	5435560	It's, it's time to up to the PlayStation 5, the Series X and all that.
5435560	5438040	Um, I wouldn't be, wouldn't be surprised.
5438040	5443400	Um, uh, pod culture and chat says great for those who can't afford tables IRL.
5443400	5445960	And Jaskren says, and for those without the space.
5445960	5447880	Yeah, that is, that is true.
5447880	5451160	Uh, oh, Bobby.
5451160	5451640	Oh, thank you.
5451640	5454520	Bobby Blackwell says Epic Game Store exclusive.
5454520	5457160	So the new FX is going to be exclusive to Epic Game Store.
5457160	5457880	Interesting.
5457880	5463960	Is that just on the, um, you know, uh, computing front or are they not going to have it on
5463960	5465480	PS5, Xbox Series X?
5465480	5469480	That's kind of surprising to me if it skips those, but, um, interesting.
5470040	5471560	Well, we'll have to follow and see what happens.
5472280	5472680	All right.
5472680	5475480	Epic Games getting up all those exclusives, I guess.
5476040	5476840	All right.
5476840	5480040	Let's, uh, now we're going to get into, and I mentioned tonight's show is going to be
5480040	5480840	a little bit shorter.
5480840	5483320	So we actually were skipping rapid fire news tonight.
5483320	5484840	We've already talked about the news.
5484840	5489400	Uh, so, uh, what's the Loki OLR, uh, in chat.
5489400	5491560	I was about to read this comment, but you're sitting right here.
5491560	5492520	What is this you're talking about?
5492520	5493020	Loki?
5493560	5497160	Oh, you guys said that Pixel Poops number two wasn't on Moby Games.
5497160	5497800	So I added it.
5498760	5499320	Did it work?
5500520	5505000	Um, if they have to go through an approval process, so they're like, well, we need it.
5505320	5507480	We need something that says shows the release date.
5507480	5510760	I'm like, Oh, why?
5510760	5511260	Okay.
5512360	5513400	Um, so I did that.
5513400	5516760	And then they're like, well, we can't add it because this company is not in the database.
5516760	5517240	Okay, fine.
5517240	5518360	I'll have the company of Davis.
5518360	5518520	Okay.
5518520	5520360	Well, we need proof that this company is a thing.
5521880	5524280	Um, hi, I'm the company.
5524280	5524840	Exactly.
5524840	5527160	It's president and CEO at your service.
5528040	5528760	It's annoying.
5528760	5529640	So we'll see it.
5530920	5532200	Let me add it pretty quick.
5532200	5534600	Uh, the game page needs approval though.
5534680	5535180	All right.
5535560	5537400	Y'all go up vote or whatever.
5537400	5537960	I don't know.
5537960	5539080	There's nothing you can do.
5539080	5539560	Okay.
5539560	5541240	Your staff has to look at it.
5541240	5543880	We need thoughts and prayers since there's nothing to do.
5543880	5544680	It doesn't matter.
5546520	5548600	You mean nothing will happen then.
5549560	5550280	It won't matter.
5550280	5550920	No one will care.
5552280	5553080	Fingers crossed.
5553080	5554280	It gets thoughts and prayers.
5554280	5554760	I know.
5554760	5555400	I know.
5555400	5555880	What else?
5555880	5557640	What else can I offer him at this time?
5557640	5558840	It's a Hanukkah miracle.
5559640	5560040	Okay.
5560040	5560600	All right, fine.
5560600	5563320	I can't, I can't hand out Hanukkah miracles, Jamie.
5563320	5565800	You're not a real game unless you put out a Kickstarter.
5565800	5568040	That's how it works with NES games nowadays.
5569640	5570200	All right.
5570200	5572840	Uh, we, we have no rapid fire news tonight.
5572840	5576200	So instead we're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of
5576200	5579480	games coming out very soon, if anything.
5579480	5581880	Although actually no, this week we do have a few.
5581880	5584440	Uh, let's go to the US, Loki.
5584440	5585080	I know of one.
5586200	5591640	We have, uh, Beyond a Steel Sky that's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
5591640	5593960	5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
5594680	5603000	Uh, Clockwork Aquario that's on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, Evil Genius 2 World
5603000	5608120	Domination on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
5609000	5618040	We have, um, Daroku Agents of Sakuratan or Sakuratani, uh, that's on Nintendo Switch.
5618920	5623320	Uh, Solar Ash on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.
5623960	5628520	Uh, Big Brain Academy, Brain vs Brain on Nintendo Switch.
5629480	5635960	Uh, Chorus on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Stadia.
5636680	5640200	Uh, Danganronpa Decadence on Nintendo Switch.
5640200	5640700	What?
5641400	5643480	And a new Danganronpa?
5644680	5645180	Yes.
5645820	5651100	And, uh, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition on Nintendo Switch.
5652380	5654860	That's a Disney life simulation game.
5655420	5656220	That sounds weird.
5657260	5659420	I, I don't think that is a new Danganronpa.
5659420	5661260	I think it's a repackaging of the old ones.
5661260	5664220	Yeah, PesoPockets in chat says that's the package of one to three, isn't it?
5664220	5664860	Yeah, I think it is.
5664860	5668780	So I think it's just a, well, there's only two games that are worthwhile in that package
5668780	5669280	then.
5670460	5671180	All right.
5671260	5675260	Uh, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases, uh, over there this week.
5675260	5680380	So on the Nintendo Switch this week, uh, we have Clockwork Aquario is out in Japan as
5680380	5680940	well.
5680940	5685100	And we also have this week, Paw Patrol, the movie Adventure City Calls.
5685100	5687260	Yes, that is a Japanese release too.
5687260	5690300	Um, Disney games do pretty well, um, overseas as well.
5690300	5694540	Disney Magic Castle, My Happy Life 2 is also out in Japan this week.
5694540	5696940	Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.
5696940	5703660	Checking out the PlayStation 5 this week, we have also Clockwork Aquario, uh, and we
5703660	5707260	have that same Paw Patrol movie game as well.
5707900	5714220	And that Disney Magic Castle, it's literally the same list on the PlayStation 5 as well.
5714220	5717340	Wait, no, I'm sorry, guys.
5717340	5719980	My list bounced up a little bit.
5719980	5721260	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5721260	5724700	Um, dude, was I looking at PlayStation 4?
5724700	5727580	There's actually nothing on PlayStation 5 this week.
5728460	5730220	Okay, it was PlayStation 4.
5730220	5732300	All those same things are on PlayStation 4 this week.
5732300	5735500	Sorry, my list skipped around because I hit the wrong thing.
5735500	5736300	My bad.
5736300	5739260	Um, but yeah, those are the releases that are out this week in Japan.
5739260	5740540	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
5741420	5742140	We have a few.
5742700	5748940	Um, on the 30th, we have Evil Genius 2 World Domination on PlayStation and Xbox and also
5748940	5753660	Oddworld Soulstorm Day 1 Audition on Xbox.
5754540	5761660	And then, uh, further in December, we have, I'm just double checking my, my dates on here.
5762540	5766780	We have Cricket 22 Official Games of the Ashes,

5773340	5778220	This Mission V-Leaf on PlayStation, Asterix and Obelix, Slap Them All.
5779180	5786620	Um, on the third, we have, uh, Chorus, um, for PlayStation and Xbox, NASCAR 21 Ignition,
5787260	5791340	uh, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition for Switch,
5791340	5794140	Big Brain Academy, Brain vs. Brain on Switch,
5794860	5797980	The Wild at Heart for Switch and PlayStation.
5797980	5801420	And on the sixth, we have Never Song for Switch.
5802780	5805740	All right, there's your releases for the week.
5806380	5808300	One more story for you guys tonight.
5808300	5810380	And this is more of a, hey, did you know this?
5810380	5816060	Speaking about the age of games and so forth, uh, as of November 22nd,
5816780	5819340	Rez is now a 20-year-old game.
5819340	5819820	That's right.
5819820	5824380	Rez turned 20 this past week, 20 years old since that game came out.
5824380	5829500	Um, and what's pretty cool to kind of celebrate that and, uh, mark the occasion for this game,
5829500	5833100	uh, the Enhance YouTube channel, um, Enhance, of course,
5833180	5837180	Tetsuya Mizuguchi's company he's working with now, they're the ones that did Tetris Effect.
5837180	5841740	Uh, I believe are credited with the Rez VR experience as well,
5841740	5844940	because both, both those games run in the Synesthesia engine.
5846060	5851900	I know that Rez VR Area X was a prototype for a new Rez game that didn't happen for whatever
5851900	5852460	reason.
5852460	5855900	Maybe it's explained in the documentary because the Enhance YouTube channel actually put up
5855900	5861180	a short documentary that talks about how the game was conceived, uh, anecdotes, experiences
5861180	5866540	from people around the industry and, uh, just kind of talking about how everybody back then
5866540	5869340	was like, you got to see this, you got to see this, you got to play this game.
5869340	5871420	Trans vibrator, you wouldn't believe it.
5871420	5873020	So, um, that's pretty cool.
5873020	5876540	You know, there was a lot of really cool stuff back in the day, especially on the Dreamcast.
5876540	5879180	You know, when you think back to things like Samba de Migo and so forth, and even things
5879180	5883100	of that era, you know, Parappa the Rappa was really big back then and so forth.
5883100	5886860	Um, it's, it's awesome that Rez is getting a little bit of love as well.
5886860	5889820	Uh, and of course, as we know, Rez did get that release.
5889820	5894780	I just talked about in 2016 with the optional VR, and then there was Area X and all that
5894780	5895580	stuff as well.
5895580	5898620	And it's even on the cloud now it's on Amazon Luna.
5898620	5899740	I had no idea.
5899740	5902140	So, um, this game is still alive all these years later.
5902140	5903740	And I think that is pretty cool.
5903740	5908060	Um, nowhere mentioned Child of Eden and that's, that's too bad because that game, that's a
5908060	5908620	great game too.
5908620	5912460	I know that game should get revisited here and there too, but I'm always, I always am
5912460	5914860	looking forward to what Tetsuya Mizuguchi has next.
5914860	5918780	I think of, of, of probably some, one of my all time favorite game designers, if not
5918780	5920700	maybe the all time, who knows?
5920700	5925580	Um, and if we're done with, uh, with Child of Eden, maybe we can have Angry Adolescent
5925580	5926060	of Limbo.
5927500	5933260	Uh, YYR in chat says Area X was really something right up there with Poly, Poly, Polybius.
5933260	5934060	I can never say that again.
5934060	5934700	Polybius.
5934700	5937580	As a must play of the FPSVR.
5937580	5939500	That's pretty funny because Polybius doesn't.
5940140	5942540	Well, it does now, but yeah, I know what I mean.
5942540	5945420	Yeah, I know based off an urban legend and all that stuff.
5945420	5945900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5945900	5947660	So I covered it as a classic game.
5947660	5948220	I know you did.
5948220	5950780	I know you did, but how that was a long time ago though.
5950780	5957180	So yeah, but anyway, uh, YYR does point out Child of Eden is backwards compatible on Xbox.
5957180	5958300	Is it now?
5958300	5960140	I think I have the disc somewhere.
5960140	5961180	I need to try it.
5961180	5963180	I'd love to play that game again, just for fun.
5963180	5967020	Cause I think it's kind of like the forgotten about sequel anyway, to that game.
5967980	5969260	Well, happy birthday Rez.
5969260	5971260	Congrats on 20 years old.
5971260	5973260	And, uh, how old does that make you feel?
5973980	5975420	I know it makes me feel old.
5975420	5975980	All right.
5975980	5977980	Let's talk about the listener round table.
5977980	5982380	We're going to take your topics in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5982380	5985740	And then of course, if you want to call in the discords open, uh, if you want to head
5985740	5987980	over to the green room, we'll take those calls as well.
5987980	5989900	Uh, and I want to get to the mailbag.
5989900	5991500	I know we have at least one email tonight.
5991500	5992700	Let's get to it.
5992700	5993260	Ooh, two.
5993260	5993900	All right.
5993900	5995100	Uh, let's get to it.
5995100	5998860	Participate at orangelauntrady.com is the place to send us an email.
5998860	5999820	Dar Sakura, take it away.
6000780	6001100	All right.
6001420	6006380	Our first email is hello, Rob Loki and dark Sakura.
6006380	6008380	I was thinking about the orange challenge.
6008380	6013020	Fudio could be replaced with a kind of support chat about diabetes.
6013980	6017660	Other members of your audience could answer your questions, offer some encouragement and
6017660	6018780	tips and maybe recipes.
6018780	6021900	And we could all offer you some hope and camaraderie.
6021900	6024220	We could do a vote among the listeners.
6024220	6029340	If this is acceptable, my husband is battling pre-diabetes and has the gene on both sides
6029340	6029980	of his family.
6030060	6034940	We have started changing our diet as if we have diabetes to help slow his progress and
6034940	6036620	to get used to the changes early.
6036620	6038940	I know it sucks and feels frustrating.
6038940	6043020	We just used our emergency money to buy an exercise bike here in Baltimore.
6043020	6047820	It's not the safest to jog outside all the time and lifestyle changes are overwhelming
6047820	6048860	at the moment.
6048860	6050700	I hope this flattens out for you.
6050700	6054220	And it sounds like the changes you've made already are having a positive effect.
6054220	6057980	I'll be thinking of you while I eat my salad and water.
6058700	6059260	Mere Muse.
6059260	6061340	Thank you, Mere Muse.
6061340	6061980	Thank you for that.
6062540	6066460	That's a very well-intentioned and great suggestion.
6066460	6071020	I think my only problem with that and shifting the conversation away from the Fudio thing
6071020	6073740	to diabetes is I do feel in some way it kind of makes it all about me.
6074540	6078620	And it's like I'm spoiling the fun of the Fudio event.
6078620	6082220	Again, I know your suggestion is completely well-intentioned and I think everybody would
6082220	6083180	support it.
6083180	6087100	However, I want my brain to be able to get to a place where I can talk about all the
6087100	6089740	food that I used to enjoy and so forth.
6089740	6095180	The good news I have is that I don't talk to a doctor again for a couple more weeks,
6095180	6101660	but just in running my numbers because I do the self blood sugar checks with the needle
6101660	6105260	and all that only a few times a week now, not every day.
6105260	6108860	In the beginning, when I was first diagnosed, it was every day, but my numbers were looking
6108860	6112780	really good after the first week that she cut it back where I only have to check a couple
6112780	6113740	times a week.
6113740	6118940	And I can say that my levels, the last couple of times I've checked, are coming way down.
6118940	6127420	For those that speak the language, I tested 107 on Friday and 103 today.
6127420	6129740	So I'm getting in a really good place.
6130700	6135420	So I just kind of want to keep riding that wave and see what my doctor has to say about
6135420	6135980	it.
6135980	6140860	I know that it's not something that's going to change overnight, but I'm losing weight
6141420	6145660	as a side effect of this whole thing since I hit my all-time highest weight this summer,
6146460	6148540	as I'm sure a lot of people did during the pandemic.
6149340	6151100	I'm now down 14 pounds from that.
6152140	6156620	So yeah, I didn't lose all at once.
6156620	6157740	I don't want people to get concerned.
6157740	6161420	There's a certain amount of weight you kind of lose fast at the beginning anyway, and
6161420	6165500	now it's the slow grind down and all that stuff.
6165500	6171820	So yeah, I'm going to talk to my doctor, I think I'd be due for that in a week or two
6171820	6175820	to kind of do the month follow-up and see how it's going and then go from there.
6175820	6182300	My hope is that I can, there's no real cure for it, of course, but you can kind of put
6182300	6185500	it into remission and that's kind of my goal.
6186220	6188300	And I think if I lose the weight, I think I might get there.
6189100	6192700	Well, I mean, that happened with, I mean, because you know, I've been in, you know,
6192700	6199180	a number of gastric bypass support groups before when I had, I mean, I wasn't quite
6199180	6206700	at, I was almost to the pre-levels before my surgery, but I also don't have the genetic
6206700	6208060	predisposition towards it.
6208700	6208940	Right.
6208940	6209340	And I do.
6209340	6210140	Yeah, yeah.
6210140	6210540	Yeah.
6210540	6217900	And so right after I had my surgery and dropped my weight, I've been middle of the road,
6217900	6219420	no matter what I eat.
6220220	6226140	And I think that it should be pointed out that there is a lot that is genetic about
6226140	6230540	it and not to assume things about people who might be over a certain weight.
6230540	6230860	Yes.
6230860	6231420	Thank you.
6231420	6232140	It's very important.
6233660	6238140	And yeah, and again, I want to address the email because I do think it's a very kind
6238140	6241980	and very thoughtful suggestion and I really appreciate, you know, again, I think your
6241980	6243580	heart is really in the right place for that.
6243580	6247980	And I obviously am right there with you and your husband and going through the changes
6247980	6248540	and so forth.
6248540	6253820	And I'm going to be very transparent and say like, I'm really glad you guys are doing
6253820	6258380	something about it now because I didn't get the courtesy of a pre-diabetes phase.
6258380	6259180	I didn't get that.
6259740	6263180	So, and that's the most frustrating thing about this whole situation.
6263180	6269340	So the fact that you guys are like doing something about it now, I think really speaks to you
6269340	6271260	guys in a positive way and so forth.
6271260	6273980	Now, here's the other thing I kind of want to say with that.
6273980	6277180	Even though I'm a little uncomfortable saying, okay, I want to take this orange launch video
6277180	6280860	thing and now, no, it has to be all about me because I came down with diabetes.
6280860	6286540	Even though I'm a little hesitant to do that, I am now going to be speaking from a place
6287180	6291500	where that's just part of me and that's something that I'm living with and that's just who I
6291500	6292220	am.
6292220	6300700	And genetics, fatness, or otherwise, I'm not going to shy away from the conversation about
6300700	6303020	it sucks to have diabetes.
6303900	6309420	It's very similar to the fact that I've been out and gay on this show for nearly 20 years
6309420	6311500	and I don't apologize for that either.
6311500	6315020	And I talk about my husband pretty openly because that is the life I live.
6315900	6322860	And if that's not something you're comfortable hearing, tough titty because that's my life.
6323820	6329580	So I kind of think to kind of go to your, like back to your email and everything, I
6329580	6333740	think when we do orange launch video, and I think I will get there, I will get to a
6333740	6335260	mental place where I'll be able to do it.
6335820	6338940	I'm going to speak to things from this perspective because that's my life now.
6339740	6342620	And that's, you know, who a part of who I am.
6342620	6344460	And I think folks understand that.
6344460	6345740	And yeah.
6346380	6347580	That's me with my autism.
6348220	6350460	Yes, it is me with my surgery.
6350460	6350960	Yes.
6351660	6355420	It's just everyone has a different experience.
6355580	6362060	And we all come from a place of our own experiences.
6364220	6369180	And that needs to be understood when people talk about these things.
6369180	6375660	So I think that honestly, I don't think that it would be making things about about you.
6375660	6377820	Just saying, I think.
6377820	6381660	And I'm admitting that's, that's a personal sort of crisis I'm having.
6381660	6382540	If that makes sense.
6382540	6383040	Yeah.
6383840	6388800	But I think it's something that could at least be involved in the discussion.
6388800	6389300	Maybe.
6390000	6392400	Talk about if I'm there, it will like that.
6392400	6393840	That's my, that's kind of my point, right?
6393840	6395360	That's not quite what I meant.
6395360	6396000	Okay.
6396000	6400800	Talk about like proper, you know, just nutrition in general.
6401440	6405920	You know, talk about habits, talk about mindfulness.
6406800	6412720	You know, it, it goes in with the discussion about food in general.
6412720	6417520	And then how bad that I was when I went to Taco Bell.
6418720	6424160	But at the same time, like if you like, you know, to go, even though I talked about a lot
6424160	6428160	of good things, just for shits and giggles, I never do this.
6428160	6431360	But since I have the home testing kit, I decided, you know what?
6431360	6433360	I'm going to test myself after Thanksgiving dinner.
6433920	6436320	And I didn't go overboard with Thanksgiving dinner.
6436320	6439600	But we go out as we did every year and I got, you know, ham as I always do.
6439600	6440880	I ate a lot of vegetables.
6440880	6442000	But I had a little bit.
6442000	6446240	I had maybe half the mashed potatoes, which is, you know, a little bit carby.
6446240	6447680	And I ate a piece of pumpkin pie.
6447680	6448320	I said, you know what?
6448320	6449840	It's fucking Thanksgiving.
6449840	6451360	I'm having a fucking piece of pumpkin pie.
6452080	6453360	Tested myself when I got home.
6454080	6455200	257.
6456400	6457360	No, geez.
6458320	6462080	So, which is not good for those that don't speak the language.
6463360	6466160	I don't know if that's a matter of just maybe I tested at the wrong time.
6466160	6468960	I waited two hours or at least I tried to, I don't know.
6468960	6473520	It could be a variety of things, but I would have tested after 24 hours, to be honest.
6473520	6475040	Well, see, but that's the crazy thing.
6475040	6480000	The next day in the morning, I have my lowest reading yet.
6481600	6486880	So it's this weird thing where, like, my body is like spiking like crazy with.
6486880	6489360	And, you know, yeah, I know I did a bad.
6489360	6490480	I'm not supposed to have pumpkin pie.
6490480	6490880	I did.
6490880	6492000	It's fucking Thanksgiving.
6492000	6493120	Let me have this.
6493120	6497040	If we don't do the nice thing for ourselves once in a while, like the Taco Bell.
6497360	6499840	That was not a nice thing.
6499840	6503280	Well, OK, the Swedish meatballs like you, whatever it is for you.
6504480	6506960	And I'm not I'm not saying I'm going to cheat every month or anything like that,
6506960	6510480	but it's one of those things where it's like, but even when I had the Thanksgiving dinner,
6510480	6512480	I was like, I'm not going to put butter on the bread.
6512480	6513440	I can skip that.
6513440	6515680	I'm not going to have sweet tea like I usually do.
6515680	6517520	I'm going to skip that and have unsweet tea.
6517520	6522000	I still cut corners, you know, and I still and then I walked 10,000 steps the next day.
6522560	6524720	So, you know, there are still things.
6524720	6528160	But anyway, that's a whole nother.
6528160	6529120	I'm getting off track.
6529120	6530480	Thank you for the email.
6530480	6531760	Thank you for the suggestion.
6531760	6534560	And my thoughts are certainly with your husband and yourself.
6534560	6538800	And thank you for being there to support him because I can tell you.
6542000	6544800	I don't want to get emotional, but if I didn't have Alan right now.
6547840	6549360	This would be a very dark place.
6549360	6552320	This would be a very, very dark place if I didn't have Alan right now.
6552320	6553520	That is all I'm going to say.
6553600	6556000	And I think you all can read between the lines on that.
6557840	6560960	SSG100Matt in chat says, hoping for the best for you, Rob,
6560960	6563440	both physically and mentally while you go through this.
6563440	6564160	I will take it.
6564800	6566880	I will take your thoughts and prayers on this
6567440	6570720	because there is literally nothing else anyone can do.
6571360	6574800	This is a me thing that I have to work through.
6576400	6578000	There's literally nothing else you can do.
6578560	6581040	So I'll take it and I appreciate it.
6581680	6584320	Honestly, it's all in your hands.
6584320	6584820	Yes.
6586000	6589920	Because the only one who's going to be able to make the healthy decisions and enact it is you.
6591600	6592720	And we can all support you.
6594480	6600000	What I tell people all the time anyway is that things don't change in our lives
6600000	6602160	until we do what we need to to make them change.
6603040	6604560	And that's practically with anything.
6605680	6608560	So I have to say, I'm really proud of you.
6608560	6612880	And I know, yeah, maybe it was necessity that pushed you to it,
6612880	6615280	but I'm still really proud that you're doing what you need to,
6615280	6618720	because I have a friend who's completely failing at managing hers.
6618720	6619200	Thank you.
6619200	6621840	And I met somebody as well who told me they have it,
6621840	6626480	and I had no idea because they don't do anything about it.
6626480	6628480	And it kind of surprised me.
6628480	6629520	I have to be honest.
6629520	6634320	So the things my body was doing, I couldn't really ignore it.
6635280	6639600	I have to, but I've been approaching it as a,
6640560	6645200	this is God and I'm using my quotey fingers, whatever you believe in.
6645200	6646240	I'm using my quotey fingers.
6646800	6651360	This is supreme being telling me I need to go on a diet.
6651360	6653440	And so, okay, you know what?
6654400	6655760	Sure, I'll go on a dog.
6655760	6658800	I'll try to get skinny like I was in high school.
6658800	6661040	I don't think I'll get all the way there, but why not?
6661040	6663920	I'll lose a few pounds and see where that puts us.
6664240	6665280	And go from there.
6665280	6667360	So, and I see your muses in chat.
6667360	6668560	Thank you again for the email.
6668560	6671520	Thank you for supporting what your husband is going through.
6672400	6676800	It's again, like I said, the spousal support is huge.
6676800	6677760	Huge, huge, huge.
6678960	6681520	Anyway, and I was gonna say, the other thing that friends can do,
6681520	6685440	like don't, like the thing that dark soccer and Loki and so forth,
6685440	6688080	the thing they can do, don't fucking bring a pie here
6688080	6690400	or don't bring cookies here and don't bring candy here.
6690400	6692400	Like that, you know, you all know that now.
6692400	6696640	And we all know we used to do that, but things are different now.
6696640	6698080	We know things now we didn't know then.
6698080	6700640	And so it's different now, but you guys in chat,
6700640	6704880	I don't think there's a lot you can do with not bringing over cake.
6704880	6707760	So I'll take your thoughts.
6707760	6711520	And besides that, I'm pretty good at sugar-free pies.
6712080	6712720	Oh, that's good.
6713760	6714240	That's good.
6714240	6716800	Hey, I did the low carb thing for like how long?
6716800	6719600	Trust me, I can make a low carb pie.
6719600	6720100	No.
6720980	6721380	All right.
6721380	6722500	You said we had a second email.
6723300	6723800	Yeah.
6724660	6727300	Hello, LR, I just wanted to share a few random thoughts
6727300	6730820	as well as some reactions of mine to slightly older episodes.
6730820	6732660	Maybe you remember, or maybe you don't,
6732660	6737380	that Neko Atsume VR, a virtual reality adaptation
6737380	6739380	of everyone's favorite mobile cat collecting game
6739380	6742260	was released a few years ago for Japanese PS4s.
6742260	6742900	Do you remember?
6743620	6746900	I have almost enough credit in my Japanese PSN account to buy it.
6746900	6749460	So every so often I check to see if it went on sale.
6749540	6751940	This time, however, suffered something even better.
6751940	6755060	Neko Atsume VR is now available in North America.
6755060	6757060	It was released just this past August.
6757060	6760740	For only $17, you can relive the joy and thrills of Neko Atsume
6760740	6764020	in glorious first generation PlayStation VR.
6764020	6765780	So if you're interested, pounce on that.
6765780	6766280	Good tip.
6767700	6769620	You recently mentioned Mega Man Battle Network
6769620	6771300	as classic game of the week.
6771300	6773140	One of the chat comments mentioned
6773140	6775060	that they would love to see a successor.
6775060	6776900	Well, a successor already exists.
6776900	6778740	It's called One Step From Eden,
6778740	6780420	and it's a deck-building roguelite
6780420	6782980	that uses Battle Network's grid-based battle system
6782980	6783700	as its basis.
6784340	6787060	Along with a lengthy single-player campaign,
6787060	6789860	it also features local PVP and co-op.
6789860	6792980	Steam's user reviews are overwhelmingly positive,
6792980	6796340	and it's available in every modern console and PC platform,
6796340	6797700	yes, including Mac.
6797700	6800100	So if you enjoyed Battle Network back in the day,
6800100	6801700	you really ought to check it out.
6802580	6805860	While playing Forza Horizon 5, I realized something.
6805860	6808820	A lot of folks just say that it's Forza Horizon 4
6808820	6811220	on a different map, and in a way, it is.
6811220	6813460	But this doesn't give credit to the massive number
6813460	6815540	of new features, refinements, and improvements
6815540	6817540	that were made to Forza Horizon 4
6817540	6819860	since it launched back in 2018.
6820500	6823380	If you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch
6823380	6825700	to Forza Horizon 4 today, yes,
6825700	6828660	they look almost like the same game on two different maps.
6828660	6832180	However, if you compare Forza Horizon 5 at launch
6832180	6835220	to day one version of Forza Horizon 4,
6835220	6837620	you will see a generational leap
6837620	6840740	that is in almost every respect,
6840740	6842820	and I wish more folks would recognize this.
6842820	6844900	Anyway, that's it now from me.
6844900	6846340	Thanks again for the show as always,
6846340	6847460	and have a great week.
6847460	6851060	Trying to shake off post-holiday doldrums, YYR.
6852420	6853300	Thanks, YYR.
6854260	6856660	And for those that are saying that Forza Horizon 5
6856660	6858660	is just more Forza Horizon 4,
6858660	6860020	why is that a bad thing?
6861460	6864580	It's like continuing this great song,
6864580	6866740	this great adventure, this great movie
6866740	6868420	with more of what you love.
6868420	6870100	But yeah, I also do agree.
6870820	6874180	Certainly the step up to series X and series S,
6874180	6875620	I know YYR has been playing on,
6875620	6878180	but that step up to be able to do that
6878180	6880980	from a graphical perspective just makes the game look
6880980	6882420	even that much better.
6882420	6884340	And just, I think there's a lot to appreciate.
6884340	6886900	I do see a step up,
6886900	6890020	but maybe I get that it's not the same step up
6890020	6891380	from three to four, two to three,
6891380	6894100	but why is that bad?
6894580	6896340	It's getting to the point where Forza Horizon
6896340	6897140	is so fucking good.
6897140	6900500	It's consistently a 90 plus critic reviewed game.
6900500	6901940	Not that it matters what the critics think,
6901940	6903540	but when they all are saying the same thing,
6903540	6904980	you can't help but listen.
6904980	6906820	It's constantly a 90 plus game.
6906820	6909380	How much better can we make it?
6909380	6910980	It's got a good formula.
6910980	6911620	Go with it.
6912260	6914820	So Mike Defton Chat says,
6914820	6915620	it's not a bad thing,
6915620	6917860	but that doesn't make it a game of the year contender.
6917860	6918900	And Bobby Blackwell says,
6918900	6920660	Deft, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.
6920660	6922900	And I am gonna side with Bobby on this one.
6922900	6926580	I will give Deft this.
6927780	6931220	I understand that that is probably the reason
6931220	6933380	it's getting overlooked for game of the year
6933380	6936100	is that it's a little too repetitive for some.
6936100	6939060	It's like, oh, well, four already did this.
6939060	6941220	So why would we nominate five game of the year
6941220	6942180	when four did this?
6942180	6944260	But I'm of the mindset where it's like,
6944260	6946180	well, you didn't give four game of the year.
6946900	6948420	At some point, you need to acknowledge
6948420	6949940	what the series is doing.
6949940	6951780	And at some point you need to...
6952660	6954820	It's like that person that's long overdue
6954820	6955940	for their fucking Oscar.
6955940	6958820	At some point, Glenn Close better win a fucking Oscar.
6958820	6959320	Am I right?
6960100	6963060	So there's just that whole thing.
6963060	6967060	So anyway, as Joe and Hunter Matt puts in chat,
6967060	6968740	not many games make it to game five.
6968740	6970820	At some point, you got to give the series an award.
6970820	6972020	Big, strong agree.
6972020	6975220	But at the same time, awards aren't everything.
6975220	6978100	I know the Grammy Award nominations came out this week.
6978100	6981060	And I have to say, I don't give a fuck about the Grammys.
6982020	6984340	It's been pointed out many times,
6984340	6986340	many issues with the Grammys.
6986340	6987700	Go look at what The Weeknd had to say
6987700	6988900	about the whole thing last year.
6990420	6991780	My understanding is, though,
6991780	6994100	and of course I'm going to smile and go,
6994100	6994980	all right, that's cute.
6995620	6996660	ABBA got nominated.
6996660	6999220	You all know I love ABBA from the 70s, right?
6999220	7003460	ABBA got nominated for their first ever Grammy this week
7005060	7006340	because I still have faith in you.
7006340	7009060	The reunion single got nominated for song of the year,
7009060	7010420	record of the year, one of those two things.
7011060	7012100	And I'm just sitting here going,
7012740	7014900	the greatest pop band of all time,
7014900	7015700	in my humble opinion,
7015700	7017380	the greatest pop band of all time
7017380	7019620	getting nominated for their first Grammy
7019620	7021620	just now in the year 2021
7021620	7023860	says all you need to know about why the Grammys are terrible.
7025140	7026580	I'm surprised they didn't get nominated
7026580	7028020	for best new artist, to be honest.
7030980	7032420	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
7032420	7034180	oh yeah, speaking of the game awards,
7034180	7037220	do we want to apply for an official co-stream for that, Rob?
7037220	7037860	Sure, yeah.
7038900	7040660	What was the time that it starts?
7040660	7042980	It doesn't start earlier than five Pacific, right?
7044420	7045300	I don't think it does.
7045300	7047620	As long as it's not earlier than five Pacific, I can do,
7047620	7049060	oh wait, I take that back.
7049060	7049780	What am I thinking?
7049780	7050900	I can do four Pacific.
7051700	7054180	So as long as, okay, that great.
7055300	7055780	Sounds good.
7056420	7057700	Next next Thursday.
7057700	7060180	Yeah, since it looks like getting down there to LA
7060180	7062340	is probably not going to happen for a multitude of reasons.
7062340	7063460	So that's fine.
7063460	7065300	I like what Jaskren said in chat.
7065300	7067140	Art is not a competition.
7067140	7068260	I like that.
7068260	7068980	It's very good.
7069700	7070180	You know what?
7070180	7071700	Your game of the year probably was,
7071700	7073460	there's probably gonna be lots of people's game of the years
7073460	7074340	that weren't nominated.
7074340	7076340	And that's, that's what it is.
7076340	7077140	That's funny.
7077140	7079620	Art is to a competition with yourself
7079620	7080580	cause it's never done.
7082420	7083060	All right.
7083060	7083780	Fair perspective.
7083780	7086340	Ooh, I'm almost missing a call in the green room.
7086340	7087700	I don't want to do that.
7087700	7089780	Let's get, yeah, I got to go to the green room and say,
7089780	7091380	hello, you're on orange lounge radio.
7091380	7091940	Who's this?
7092900	7094340	Hey, what's going on everybody?
7094340	7095060	It's Rama.
7095060	7096420	Hey Rama, it's good to hear from you.
7097300	7098660	Right back at you.
7098660	7102260	As you can see, I actually left the house for Thanksgiving.
7102260	7102820	What?
7102820	7104100	Leaving the house?
7104100	7104900	Overrated.
7105460	7106580	Who does that anymore?
7107540	7108740	I know it's a new thing.
7108740	7112820	And besides, I wore my mask and it was a very nice
7112820	7116980	Thanksgiving feast followed by laying around,
7116980	7120180	watching TV and doing Black Friday shopping online
7120180	7121540	where everything is delivered to the house.
7123220	7125220	You know, very chill stuff.
7125220	7126740	That is a great, that's, you know,
7126740	7128180	between the walking and everything,
7128180	7131460	I spent a lot of my extended weekend playing video games
7131460	7133140	and that felt very good.
7133140	7134500	SSJ100Matt in chat says,
7134500	7136900	putting on pants is very overrated.
7136900	7137380	Truth.
7138100	7138500	Truth.
7139620	7141060	It depends on your version of pants.
7141060	7142420	Cause some people need to wear underwear.
7143780	7145140	US pants.
7146980	7148100	Hey, that works.
7149380	7150100	That works.
7150100	7153140	And before I want to talk about what I want to call in,
7153140	7154900	I just want to say that, you know,
7154900	7158820	while I was doing my shift on Friday, working from home,
7158820	7159620	I figured, you know what,
7159620	7161780	let me turn on the switch and play some games.
7161780	7164260	I ended up finding myself looking at Paramount Plus
7164260	7167140	and watching a documentary called Console Wars.
7167140	7170180	But what was great about it was from Sega's point of view.
7170180	7171380	So it was really interesting.
7171380	7171880	Ooh.
7172740	7173860	I don't think I've seen that one.
7173860	7174500	I have to look that up.
7174500	7175940	I think I've heard of it, but I haven't seen it.
7175940	7176660	I need to look that up.
7177300	7178500	I just stumbled upon it.
7178500	7181140	I'm like, 16-bit graphics.
7181140	7182340	Let me see what this is all about.
7182340	7183220	Oh, wow.
7183220	7185780	This is from the other side.
7185780	7186660	This is good.
7186660	7188900	Paramount Plus has some good stuff on it, I got to say.
7188900	7191220	Like, again, I'm not being paid to shill them,
7191220	7196180	but I know there's a lot of talk about everybody's got their own streaming service.
7196180	7197300	But I get that.
7197300	7201700	But I will say, you know, because Paramount Plus was the CBS thing,
7201700	7202580	which was kind of weak.
7203380	7204980	It's a lot stronger now.
7204980	7205700	I will say this.
7205700	7206660	Like, the fact they're getting, like,
7206660	7209140	international versions of Survivor is super cool to me.
7209780	7213140	And that real-world reunion, they just started.
7213140	7214980	So I don't know if you guys even know this.
7214980	7218900	The real-world Los Angeles, which, like, that was when I was in high school.
7218900	7222900	Like, that was, like, growing up on, like, that series and watching it on TV.
7222900	7224260	That was reality TV, right?
7224260	7226100	Okay, so there was a girl from Alabama.
7226100	7227300	I was like, oh, my gosh.
7227300	7228340	Get this, Dark Sakura.
7228340	7233300	So what they did all these years later, it's a Paramount Plus exclusive show.
7233300	7235620	They got all of the original.
7235620	7237220	So they did it for the first one, New York.
7237220	7240260	They got all of the original cast together, except for one guy,
7240260	7241860	because he tested positive for COVID.
7241860	7247140	And they put them in a similar apartment and put them there for a week to revisit everything.
7247140	7251860	Well, they just debuted the second season with the LA cast.
7251860	7257460	And let me tell you, that cast has some history and they really get into it.
7257460	7259460	And you want to talk about alternate points of view.
7260340	7262580	Because everybody knows about, like, that hallway incident.
7262580	7264980	Like, that was television, right?
7264980	7266900	Is that the cast that had Pedro?
7266900	7267860	No, that was three.
7267860	7269140	That got dice here.
7269140	7269780	Yeah.
7269780	7272660	Apparently, they're skipping from two to nine.
7272660	7274260	They've already renewed it for a third season.
7274260	7277460	They're going to go all the way to the New Orleans one, because for whatever reason,
7277460	7281460	I would imagine the San Francisco one just they could not get enough.
7281460	7283700	Like, there's always someone who sits it out.
7283700	7286340	Obviously, we lost Pedro, and that is horribly tragic.
7286340	7289460	But I think with San Francisco, they probably I doubt, you know,
7289460	7291300	that conservative girl that's been on the view.
7291300	7292740	She's not going to fucking do it.
7292740	7295460	Uh, and a lot of those people in the cast are not going to do it.
7295460	7299060	But the L.A. people, I was surprised they got a lot of those people to do it.
7299060	7302580	There's a couple missing, but they got the people that were involved in that
7303220	7306100	whole thing with the trying to pull the girl's clothes off
7306100	7308500	with the blanket and dragging down the hallway.
7308500	7309780	I remember that.
7309780	7310020	Yeah.
7310020	7311380	See, that was very, very.
7311380	7312740	That was disgusting.
7312740	7314820	And they get into it.
7314820	7317860	And you you want to talk about hearing it from another point of view.
7317860	7319220	You find out things.
7319220	7321300	I'm not going to spoil it for those of you.
7321300	7324580	You hear her talk about things that she was dealing with at the time
7325140	7327620	that she never disclosed when she was doing the show.
7327620	7330340	And it makes you look at that from a whole new light.
7330340	7333940	And it's it's really, really interesting.
7333940	7336180	And the aggressor is still right there.
7336180	7340420	And at least at the end of the first episode, he wasn't totally hearing it.
7340420	7345300	He really wasn't still still all these years later really understanding it.
7345300	7349780	It was just it was really it's hard to watch in some ways.
7349780	7351300	And they have a car intent warning on it.
7351300	7354660	But I thought it was so interesting all these years later, for sure.
7354660	7356900	I might have to look on like YouTube or something.
7356900	7357460	Yeah.
7357460	7358900	So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to.
7359540	7363060	I didn't mean to show Paramount Plus during your call, Rama.
7363060	7367620	But I will say, like there is I know they've been getting a lot of shit
7367620	7370820	about Star Trek Discovery in Europe as they should.
7370820	7373620	But at least here in the US, it's got a lot of good shit.
7373620	7377780	Jaskren says the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga concert also aired tonight on Paramount Plus.
7378340	7379220	Really?
7379220	7380180	I'm going to watch it.
7380180	7382180	They have the Madame X Madonna thing, too.
7382900	7386420	I got to say, Paramount Plus is I get why people dog on it.
7386420	7388420	But at the same time, they've got some really good shit.
7388420	7390500	Like they're up and coming pretty good.
7390500	7391460	And yes, they did.
7391460	7392820	They fixed the Discovery thing.
7392820	7398340	They're putting it on Pluto TV, which is Viacom's free thing in the UK.
7398340	7400180	So I don't know how that all works.
7400180	7402740	But yes, the UK gets Discovery after all.
7402740	7404420	Anyway, Rama, I'm sorry.
7404420	7406500	What did you actually call that tonight?
7406500	7407620	Not streaming TV.
7408180	7410500	Because you mentioned Gaga, I'm going to.
7410500	7411700	Are you going to see House of Gucci?
7411700	7412260	Yes or no?
7413540	7418020	No, because my friends that have seen it have all said it's not great.
7418020	7421060	Like it's not bad, but it's not great.
7421060	7425940	And just watch it when it's on Paramount Plus or whatever service it's on.
7425940	7426820	That's what I've heard about.
7426820	7427380	Sounds good.
7427380	7431380	You know, I love me some Gaga, though, but can I sit there for two and a half hours when
7431380	7433300	she's only in like 15, 20 minutes of it?
7433300	7433700	I don't know.
7435380	7435860	Fair enough.
7436580	7444100	So what I want to talk about real quick is along the lines of the whole Bobby Kotek drama,
7444100	7450100	because we had something similar happen out here a few years back at a local convention
7450100	7451140	to summarize.
7451140	7452660	We had a con chair.
7452660	7459220	He was one of those where if there was any issues whatsoever, you talk directly to him.
7459220	7463620	He was always on the floor talking to people and he would do whatever he could to take
7463620	7464340	care of it.
7464900	7469300	Well, there were some harassment issues coming that he was aware of.
7469300	7472340	So he did the right thing as the con chair.
7472340	7475300	He brought it up to the board and explained what was going on.
7475300	7480900	There were some department heads who thought that their shit didn't stink as well as harassing
7480900	7481860	other people.
7481860	7487220	And from my understanding, the board was basically like the boys club.
7487780	7492820	So as much as my friend, who was the con chair, kept bringing it up and trying to fix things,
7493780	7495380	he ended up stepping down.
7495380	7496980	He says, I can't do it anymore.
7496980	7501380	It was basically him against the world and he couldn't fight it.
7501380	7513620	So we have a new con chair come in and things got a lot worse and I can later send you links
7513620	7515460	to articles in regards to it.
7515460	7518660	But let's just say the harassment continued.
7518660	7522100	The con chair just threw a blind ear to it.
7522180	7526340	He was also like, well, if you scratch my back, I scratch your back, too.
7526340	7531300	You know, it got to the point where people got tired of it.
7532580	7539060	He stepped down and now we have a new con chair running this convention and he's basically
7539860	7542100	unfucking everything that had happened.
7542660	7544660	So but the board is all still there.
7545700	7549860	Far as I know, a couple of members of the board are still there.
7550260	7555700	The issue is with a lot of anime conventions is that it starts out as a fun thing.
7555700	7560420	And then when you realize what you can do and what power you have, it goes to your head
7560980	7563220	and it's like, yeah, there you go.
7563220	7564580	You could do whatever you want.
7564580	7566180	It's like, oh, it's fine.
7566180	7566980	We could do this.
7566980	7568420	It's fine to do that.
7568420	7569860	No, it is not.
7569860	7576340	This is one of the reasons why I don't staff conventions anymore, because I can tell you
7576340	7580100	stories of things I have seen, I have heard and I'm like, you know what?
7580100	7582260	I this is something I cannot do.
7583060	7584980	Nobody's holding the board accountable.
7584980	7587540	And that's your common denominator with the Activision story.
7588340	7588660	Right.
7589460	7595460	But I will say the difference is that one person tried to basically fight the board.
7595460	7597540	And so I just can't do it.
7597540	7600260	And I understand this all so much.
7600260	7605460	And what bothers me the most is that you're the con chair.
7605460	7606340	You're on the board.
7606340	7608180	You are basically the head guy.
7608180	7610820	And everybody else is like, yeah, no.
7613060	7618900	I mean, one person harassed a friend of mine to the point where she will not attend the
7618900	7619940	convention anymore.
7619940	7626180	She filed multiple grievances and complaints because he was friends with people on the
7626180	7626660	board.
7627380	7628340	They went to deaf ears.
7629220	7632900	And unfortunately, that's what it's going to take for the board to fight.
7633780	7638980	It's like I said, and you agree when I said money, you said, uh huh.
7638980	7640260	And that's what it's going to take.
7640820	7642980	Lack of money to change the tone.
7642980	7646260	And that is the common denominator with the Activision thing.
7646260	7650340	Now, of course, in the Activision thing, you also have a toxic, poisonous CEO who won't
7650340	7652180	get out of there and the board's protecting him.
7652180	7655700	I mean, none of these people threaten to kill anyone, at least as far as I know.
7655700	7660740	But my point is, is that it's going to take the shareholders starting to oust the board
7660740	7666100	members and holding those types of elections in order and as the only way that will happen
7666100	7668100	is if Activision continues to lose money.
7668100	7671060	I do want to point out Activision is losing money this year.
7672500	7676740	If you look at their stock and this is beyond just that recent dip in this, I mean, that
7676740	7681060	doesn't help, but this is beyond the recent Omnicron dip in the stock market.
7681060	7688900	This is Activision has been trending downward because this leak of stuff will not I guess
7688900	7693220	that's not not the right way to put it, but this this toxic leak will not get plugged
7693220	7693860	up.
7693860	7695540	Bobby Kotick is still there.
7696820	7704020	And you know what, Rob, the sad part is, is that regardless of what's going on at Activision,
7704020	7707300	people are going to pick up and play the games because, oh, this is my game.
7707300	7708100	I want to play it.
7708100	7708820	You shouldn't play.
7708820	7709460	Let's go.
7709460	7709940	I don't care.
7709940	7711380	I want to play that game.
7711380	7716020	Like I could tell you about issues with various conventions.
7716020	7723620	There is one guy who runs multiple conventions and he is a known registered sex offender.
7724180	7725140	But you know what?
7725940	7731300	People still go to his conventions because of their friends that are going, the guests
7731300	7732980	that are appearing and all that.
7733860	7735940	And he has screwed the guests in the past.
7735940	7737780	He has screwed the hotels in the past.
7738500	7742020	He's not even allowed to be in certain hotels because he owes them money.
7742020	7742820	But you know what?
7743380	7746500	He continues to run these conventions and people will go.
7746500	7751620	It's like any reason to go to a convention equals to any reason to buy the game.
7751620	7757060	I guarantee you Activision can have a fire sale on the latest Call of Duty and put it
7757060	7759380	out and say it's $19.99.
7759380	7763220	The sheer number of people that will go that will that will buy it.
7763220	7764020	Just saying.
7764020	7764520	Sure.
7765140	7766180	You know what, though?
7766180	7768580	I'm putting my foot down no more.
7768580	7769700	Not on my watch.
7769700	7770740	I'm one person.
7771460	7774180	Maybe I don't matter, but it's got to start somewhere.
7774980	7776020	Dude, you matter.
7776020	7779380	I have a friend who worked for Activision Blizzard.
7779380	7779860	She was.
7781220	7783060	She did like she worked like on the board.
7783060	7788660	So she's told me some horror stories, you know, and we used to play Overwatch.
7788660	7792580	No, I have I have not touched Overwatch since all of this happened.
7792580	7793540	And I'm like, you know what?
7794260	7799140	I have plenty of other games that I can play in the meantime.
7799140	7799640	Yep.
7800580	7806980	I am perfectly content playing Powerwash Simulator over Diablo two until Bobby Kotick
7806980	7807480	is handled.
7808180	7811540	I just picked up I just picked up Xenoblade Chronicles.
7811540	7813940	I could start playing that and check it out and check that out.
7813940	7814820	You know, that's a lot of fun.
7814820	7815320	Yeah.
7815320	7815820	Yeah.
7816660	7819620	I just picked up Ghost of Tsushima directors cut from as well.
7819620	7821700	I'm like, that's a I'll definitely you know.
7824100	7825860	There's no shortage of games, people.
7825860	7827780	There's no shortage of games, people.
7827780	7831860	I mean, look, if I really want to if I really want to play something like Call of Duty,
7831860	7833700	I'll go play Battlefield and Call of the Day.
7833700	7834200	That's it.
7836260	7839540	Bobby Blackwell was pointing out Paladins versus Overwatch.
7839540	7840040	Why not?
7840500	7844660	Mike Deft in chat says Pokemon Unite to fill the salt in my life.
7846100	7851940	West Buster says as a side note, since news of California's investigation broke this summer,
7852580	7855380	ATVI has lost 30 percent of its value.
7855380	7855700	Yep.
7855700	7858580	And also supports what you're saying is Xenoblade Chronicles is awesome.
7858580	7859080	That's request.
7861540	7866580	So I am not I'm not shedding a tear over this, you know, and the thing is,
7868660	7874660	I also have friends that work Activision Blizzard, and those are where my tears are going because
7874660	7879940	I know they are they are victims trying to make a paycheck in this horrible situation
7879940	7883540	that and I feel bad because I'm sitting here going, well, I'm boycott.
7883540	7889940	But it just hit a point where I'm like, nothing else is working and the situation isn't changing.
7891220	7897460	It has to it has to like Activision has to be hurt financially for the exactly to do
7898260	7901700	fucking anything besides forming a committee to investigate themselves.
7903220	7906420	Which is so transparent, I'm so glad people are seeing right through it,
7906420	7909940	especially in the financial channels and calling them on their bullshit.
7909940	7912420	It's just anyway.
7912420	7915140	Yes. And Bobby Blackwell says not only are they getting a paycheck,
7915140	7917940	those employees still really care about the worlds they are creating.
7917940	7920340	Yes. And I cannot wait to experience them
7920340	7925300	when Bobby Kotek is gone and that day is over due and counting.
7925940	7927460	Exactly. Exactly.
7928340	7930420	Rama, anything else on your mind tonight before we wrap it up?
7931620	7933060	One quick thing and I'm gonna get out of here.
7934500	7935620	You ever see development?
7936420	7937700	Oh, it's many times.
7937700	7939220	It's been a while, but yeah, of course.
7940100	7941380	Multi pass.
7941380	7944420	OK, for the high pass for the podcast listeners,
7944420	7946980	he's holding up a multi pass on the camera there.
7946980	7952260	So and it has a multi task and it has and it has my covid card in here.
7952260	7954420	So I'm like a friend of mine was selling these.
7954420	7956020	I'm like, I want one.
7956020	7957540	I'm like, give me one.
7958900	7960500	I keep this at my desk.
7960500	7964260	So I know because this week I am getting the booster shot.
7964260	7965540	So that's cute.
7965540	7969220	I love that the multi passes the covid that I just have the thing because they built it
7969220	7973140	into iPhone where you can just bring up the bar code and everything is just right there,
7973700	7974420	which I like.
7974420	7976580	So I don't bother with my card anymore.
7976580	7979220	So I just think it's something to have.
7979220	7980420	So, you know, it is it is.
7981060	7986900	If assuming Dragon Con still mandates vaccine or prior test or whatever they do next year,
7986900	7989540	I will take a multi pass and have it in there and do it that way.
7989540	7993780	That's that's what my friend puts him up for sale.
7993780	7995620	I will shoot all of y'all a message.
7995620	7997140	OK, sounds good.
7997140	7997460	All right.
7998020	7998740	Take care, Rama.
7998740	7999620	Thanks so much for the call.
7999620	8000180	Appreciate you.
8000180	8000660	All right.
8000660	8001460	Take care, y'all.
8001460	8001960	Bye.
8003060	8003460	All right.
8003460	8004340	Oh, we have another.
8004340	8005780	We got another call.
8005780	8006500	Let's do it.
8006500	8008420	Let's just go right to another call.
8009220	8009540	Hi.
8009540	8010820	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8010820	8011320	Who's this?
8012340	8018580	This week, VX JasonXV calls into Orange Lounge Radio once again and extends his talking time
8018580	8019080	total.
8019780	8022500	We love hearing you talk here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8022500	8026100	I remember when you were when we were in a situation, you had the ability to sit in on
8026180	8028820	episodes and always loved having you here, Jason.
8028820	8030980	And it's a pleasure to have you here tonight.
8030980	8031700	What's on your mind?
8031700	8035380	Oh, in the before times, as as they call it these days.
8035380	8036100	Yeah, indeed.
8037700	8041460	Have you have any of you watched Legends of the Hidden Temple?
8043860	8044660	Not the new one.
8044660	8047220	Just the one back in the day movie.
8049220	8052740	Also that which I only recently, I think, relearned about.
8052820	8057140	But I was I was alluding to the game show series that started back up in the last what?
8057140	8058900	Just last month, I think, or October.
8058900	8059700	That was last month.
8059700	8060580	It's not December yet.
8061300	8065780	No, my my friend Victoria from Shaking and Crying, that show that we had here,
8067380	8069060	really wanted to audition for that with me.
8069060	8070180	And I wanted to do it, too.
8070180	8072900	But it's just there was no way I was going to be able to get down to L.A. and do that.
8072900	8073700	I'll do all that stuff.
8073700	8075940	But yeah, we would we would have been so good on that show.
8075940	8077460	But is it adults now?
8077460	8079140	It's yeah, it's adults.
8080100	8083380	It was it's a little strange to me because the casting call that I saw
8083380	8087700	said like eighteen to twenty ones, like like sub twenty fives.
8087700	8090500	But there have definitely been older groups like there were
8091700	8094100	last weeks or two episodes ago, two episodes ago.
8094100	8094600	Definitely.
8095780	8097140	I've watched the whole series so far.
8097140	8097700	The whole season.
8101700	8102740	Don't worry.
8102740	8106660	There's a minute more in the temple and people are still fucking everything up.
8106660	8108100	So it's not just kids that are stupid.
8108740	8113300	It's a little it's a little weird because the casting call that I saw was early 20 somethings.
8113300	8117060	Yet two episodes ago, I think it was the Silver Snakes, one of the teams,
8117060	8121620	the teams that was at the Temple Run, both of them were in the original airing of the show.
8121620	8124660	And it's been 22 years alone since the show.
8124660	8125140	More than that.
8125140	8126340	It's been like 25 years.
8126340	8126840	Yeah.
8127460	8129940	So I don't know if like I don't know.
8129940	8132500	I don't know anything about how L.A. Hollywood TV shows work.
8132500	8134660	I don't know if there were multiple casting calls.
8134660	8136980	I don't know if it was just like apply anyways.
8136980	8138580	And maybe the producer will accept you.
8138580	8140420	I don't know how you are correct.
8140420	8142100	They're putting their feelers out everywhere.
8142100	8143220	They have casting calls here.
8143220	8144660	They post on social media.
8144660	8147700	They probably have recruiters that go out and try to find people.
8147700	8148420	It's it's all of it.
8148420	8152900	They probably they probably had contact information for past contestants.
8152900	8155940	And they probably looked that way to try to find them.
8155940	8156580	I bet they did.
8157140	8159780	But yeah, no, I know that it's on the CW, right?
8159780	8164740	And I'm assuming you can watch in their app or something like that or maybe one of those things.
8164740	8168580	That's pretty cool that I keep I keep forgetting that it's back.
8168580	8171300	I saw a commercial for it at random.
8171300	8172980	But yeah, I just I keep forgetting it's back.
8172980	8173620	But that's so cool.
8174660	8181620	It's these these last many years, adult grown up, much more mature.
8181620	8183700	Jason, relatively speaking, has come out.
8183700	8190580	It's it's just been really, really weird to me because like I think about all the conflicts
8190580	8195060	I used to have with people, just like social situation and conflicts and those sorts of things.
8195620	8201140	And the rationales that I gave at the time, the times that I know I didn't have a rationale
8201140	8204660	and I made shit up because I wasn't going to give up my core point.
8204660	8208660	And then I kind of take a step back and think about that in conflicts in general of things
8208660	8214420	of things that don't have like, you know, an obvious aggressor damage detriment,
8214420	8214980	that sort of thing.
8214980	8216260	But just just social strife.
8216980	8221140	The thing that you hear about more often than not, then, you know, the worst of physical
8221140	8222420	examples and everything else.
8222420	8227940	And it's just kind of like, you know, you know, complaints between you and your parents
8227940	8232580	about your parents believing this way and telling you why, but you feeling differently,
8232580	8234980	but not having the life experience to really talk about yet.
8235540	8241540	And it's just it's so many different and annoying things to think about that.
8242420	8248500	Accept yourself for who you are, but you probably have to be this different way in this different
8248500	8249140	situation.
8250100	8256980	You know, lean into the I I've used the I have a face for radio joke against myself
8256980	8258340	and I still kind of feel that way.
8259060	8261460	You know, lean into it because that's who I am.
8261460	8263860	But there's going to be limits to it.
8263860	8267540	And radio, you know, audio only only goes so far these days.
8268180	8272740	And this channel is one of the very few situations I can think of any other channel and anybody
8272740	8275140	else, anybody else's production that does something like that.
8276900	8279540	Independence Day had had its sequel.
8280820	8283860	Jeez, it was either 2016 or 2018 or something like that.
8284500	8289220	And I finally watched it a couple of weeks ago and I thought to myself, is this movie
8289220	8291540	terrible or am I just an adult now?
8291540	8296420	Because I loved the first one, but the second one was just goofy as hell.
8298020	8298980	And I don't know.
8298980	8300660	I don't know what to blame it on.
8300660	8301060	I don't.
8301060	8304180	I didn't look up if it's the same director, the same producer, the same writer.
8304180	8305620	I'm pretty sure it is.
8305620	8306660	Rob something.
8306660	8307620	Rod or Rob something.
8309380	8310980	Or if it's just there.
8312020	8312660	Thank you.
8312660	8313300	You nailed it.
8314100	8319300	It's the I have this conversation with myself over and over and over about social situations.
8319300	8322500	And it's there's there's never going to be a resolution.
8322500	8325060	There's never going to be one single answer that applies in every case.
8325060	8330820	And it's just a really difficult topic to I don't want to use the word agonize over,
8330820	8333220	but the only term that's coming to mind is agonize over.
8336580	8339380	Um, I don't know where to begin.
8339380	8342900	Um, yeah, there's I thought about caveatting this.
8342900	8346580	I'm going to rely on you and your ability to make sense of my rambling, not lunacy.
8346580	8349140	It makes sense, but it's also kind of interesting.
8349140	8352340	All of those little like lemons that life throws at you.
8352340	8355700	We just had an extensive conversation about something I'm going through.
8355700	8358020	There wasn't something I was facing when I was 21.
8358020	8362180	And, you know, kind of like a lot of the changes that that's caused in my own life.
8362180	8365380	And so, you know, sometimes there isn't.
8366180	8369940	You know, those changes and those things, there's not a lot you can do about it.
8369940	8374580	You know, whether it be genetic disposition or just the fact that bad things happened
8375460	8376660	to people all the time.
8376660	8378660	And it's just the way that it is.
8378660	8382020	The only thing you kind of can control is how do you sort of respond?
8382340	8384580	To those types of situations, right?
8384580	8387220	Yeah, that that's all you really can do.
8388100	8394260	But I think it's nice that these sorts of comfort foods like classic video games,
8394260	8399140	like a remasters of classic video games, even like, oh, no, did we lose Jason?
8400100	8401220	No, we lost Jamie.
8401220	8401620	That's weird.
8401620	8401860	All right.
8401860	8402580	She should be back.
8402580	8403300	That's odd.
8403300	8405140	Oh, this is a weird little hiccup.
8405140	8410900	Um, uh, but we have like, you know, those types of comfort food types of things.
8411620	8415860	The old game shows that come back again to sort of remind us of those better times,
8415860	8419860	even if the situation now might be different.
8419860	8422420	For example, if you think about it, because of what I'm dealing, you know,
8422420	8426260	I love those types of reality shows, like The Survivor and Big Brother.
8426260	8427780	And people have joked to me that.
8430020	8433140	Sorry, I heard a very strange noise outside.
8433140	8433780	Sorry, guys.
8433780	8435940	So joys of doing things live in your house.
8435940	8439220	Um, anyway, um, where was I?
8439220	8439620	Oh, yes.
8439620	8443140	Um, I love those types of shows like Survivor and Big Brother and so forth.
8443140	8445140	Um, and people say, oh, you should go on Survivor.
8445140	8445940	You should go on Survivor.
8446500	8451460	The reality is kind of sitting in now that they would never touch me with my condition.
8452260	8452760	Yeah.
8453620	8455140	I'm never going to get put on that show now.
8456020	8458340	Um, and that's just age.
8458340	8458980	I say that.
8458980	8459940	I say that not.
8459940	8464100	I say that not to insult you, of course, but the nature that all of those are the young,
8464100	8464660	hot.
8464660	8465940	Well, that I know of.
8465940	8468020	They have 40 and 50 somethings that go on that show.
8468020	8474900	They usually try to diversify the age a little bit, but there are more of the good looking
8474900	8476980	model types that are recruited from bars.
8476980	8478340	Yes, absolutely.
8478340	8480740	My chances would be lower, but not gone.
8480740	8483060	And now it's like that's never going to happen.
8484100	8488420	But I have ways to play it online when I have the time.
8488980	8492980	I have other ways to, you know, kind of participate and so forth.
8493540	8499700	My point is, is that, you know, the situations will change and it's how you respond to them
8499700	8502500	that truly is you and your character and so forth.
8503620	8509860	And sometimes it's neat to revisit things from a different time because it not only
8509860	8514100	necessarily reminds you about thing, but it reminds you of that simpler time when your
8514100	8516740	problems didn't seem as bad as they are today.
8518180	8521460	Or maybe the opposite in some cases, depending on what it is.
8522100	8522600	Yeah.
8523860	8530500	Yeah, that topic just spirals endlessly because it's also like finding your people to enjoy
8530500	8532820	it with and having to deal with the people that don't.
8533780	8534660	That's huge, yes.
8535780	8538100	No, finding your people is so important.
8538100	8538740	It really is.
8538740	8539460	Yeah.
8539460	8540580	Thank God for the internet.
8541700	8546980	You folks, I agree with you in opinion when we were talking about, when you were talking
8546980	8552660	about the Mass Effect TV show, that a unique story is more preferable to, hey, let's take
8552660	8554260	the game and put it on TV.
8554260	8558820	The game was an experience and people, it is very, games by nature being interactive
8558820	8561060	is very highly personal to oneself.
8562100	8568340	And so to retell that story, yeah, is probably, you're not going to satisfy everyone, but
8569300	8574660	picking one person's story is probably going to satisfy the fewest of them all in the grand
8574660	8575380	scheme of things.
8575940	8579940	I like remasters because I know the technology changes.
8579940	8581460	I don't have a lot of older devices.
8581460	8583540	I like the ability to have it again.
8583540	8590180	Rebuying it, that's a little difficult in the era of cloud gaming and I've always been
8590180	8591300	an emulating person.
8591300	8596660	So with the official blessing of that and cloud gaming and everything else, opportunities
8596660	8599860	for preservation and back catalog stuff is happening even more.
8599860	8607380	Yeah, I think the summary of everything that I'm getting at is that everything is fucking
8607380	8608260	difficult.
8608260	8609620	Weave your way through it.
8609620	8613700	Do what you enjoy at no detrimental expense to others.
8613700	8619300	Don't be a Roblox harasser fucking ass hat for the subs.
8620500	8622820	How about if people just not be twats?
8624340	8625220	It would be lovely.
8625860	8641220	Yeah, do what you love and solicit the help of either your social circle, a guidance counselor,
8641220	8647700	mental health therapist, whatever the desired level is for seemingly irresolvable conflicts.
8649060	8652580	There are the things out there for you to express yourself in the way that you want
8652580	8657060	to do and there are the people to help you through it when it becomes difficult and you
8657060	8658740	want to keep going down that road.
8658740	8662020	There are people that can help you with that and you should absolutely avail yourself of
8662020	8666180	them as difficult as that may be in and of itself as well.
8667220	8668740	I think we'll leave it on that note.
8668740	8669540	Thank you, Jason.
8669540	8672500	I really appreciate the call and the introspection tonight.
8673220	8679860	That oh so happy thought in the post Thanksgiving still burn off and December ramp up and...
8679860	8685540	It's it's necessary just because it's just because it's I don't know what the right word
8685540	8689780	would be difficult to talk about doesn't mean it shouldn't be so.
8689780	8690660	Oh, absolutely.
8690660	8691620	A hundred percent.
8691620	8692120	Absolutely.
8692900	8693220	All right.
8693220	8694340	Take care of my friend.
8694340	8697140	We'll we'll hear from you next week for sure, at least in the intro.
8697140	8699780	But I hope we talk again on these calls again real soon.
8700420	8701060	Absolutely.
8701060	8701860	Hear me later.
8701860	8702100	All right.
8702100	8702660	Take care, buddy.
8703780	8704020	All right.
8704020	8706820	And you will hear Jason later in the outro of the show, that's for sure.
8706820	8710980	OK, that's going to do it for phone calls tonight and we are about to wrap up.
8711620	8717700	However, before we get there, I do I solicited tweets tonight and Jason brought up emulation
8717700	8718980	and I was like, oh, yeah, we had a tweet.
8718980	8719620	I want to get to it.
8720180	8723300	So we had a tweet tonight from at Garth the Wolf.
8723300	8726340	And if you want to follow us on OLR at OLR is the place to do it.
8727700	8733860	Who tweeted us a potential topic for tonight, saying Nintendo's N64 emulation for their
8733860	8737060	online service is shoddy at best.
8737060	8741700	Ocarina of Time is plagued with lag issues and degraded visuals with similar issues in
8741700	8744820	Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64.
8744820	8745460	Thoughts?
8745460	8747140	You think Nintendo will patch this?
8748660	8752420	Um, no, I think they're under pressure to I I'm a little less cynical.
8752420	8755540	I think they will eventually, especially if they want people to renew that thing in a
8755540	8756100	year.
8756100	8761140	Um, but boy, boy, did a lot of people learn a lesson about paying for something for a
8761140	8763300	year on name alone.
8764100	8766100	And boy, was that a tough lesson to learn?
8766100	8767300	I didn't get it.
8767300	8768740	And I certainly have.
8768740	8773060	But when I see tweets like that and feedback about how the emulation really in that I'm
8773060	8774820	certainly not motivated to get it now.
8775540	8782900	So I just I don't know how many cynical people like me are truly out there and how many people
8782900	8786900	bought it on name alone and the promise of all this other stuff, or maybe the Animal
8786900	8791140	Crossing DLC, if you look at it, really did kind of enhance the value if that was something
8791140	8792100	you were into.
8792100	8793460	So there's a variety of reasons.
8793460	8800100	But yeah, I think Nintendo will be pressured to patch it, but they're certainly in no hurry.
8800100	8803620	In my opinion, they've got a year to do it because they got a bunch of people already
8803620	8804820	pony up a year.
8804820	8807060	So don't expect it tomorrow.
8807060	8808500	But if it does drop tomorrow, great.
8811460	8812260	All right.
8812260	8814260	Thank you for the tweets at O L R.
8814260	8815860	I'll try to incorporate more.
8815860	8818900	So I know you guys tag us and I don't always read them on the show because I forget on
8818900	8821540	Sunday night, but I'll try to remind myself to check that more often if you guys want
8821540	8824740	to send us some lovely tweets at O L R for now, though.
8824740	8825940	Hey, we're two and a half hours in.
8825940	8828500	I thought this would be a shorter show tonight, and it's kind of a normal length show.
8828500	8833460	We just had a lot of good, good, good things to chew on here at the table after Thanksgiving.
8833460	8838500	So I appreciate you guys being here and going through the show with us all.
8838500	8842340	I do want to check real quick and ask for any last minute stories from my co-host.
8842340	8845220	I'm not expecting any this week, but not for me.
8845220	8851300	OK, there's the I guess project that's called Destination Home.
8851380	8856740	They've been working on this project for years now to reattempt to bring PlayStation Home
8856740	8862900	back, and apparently they're still making some more progress on that.
8862900	8868660	They have released a teaser trailer showing some of the stuff that I mean, they've kind
8868660	8870660	of brought back some of the spaces and everything.
8871700	8876260	So if Sony shuts it down, it'll tell you something.
8877140	8881140	I'm surprised they haven't tried to like spin it off to make like, you know, their
8881140	8887060	own thing instead of bringing PlayStation Home back, just like make a new thing that's
8887060	8891380	not PlayStation Home, like VR chat and release it on PlayStation, the ultimate gag.
8893060	8895300	Yeah, it's like, all right.
8896020	8897060	Are they gagging?
8899860	8902100	That's going to bring our show to a close for tonight.
8902100	8904900	Thank you guys for listening to our show.
8904900	8908660	Whether you were here live or you downloaded us on the podcast feed through your favorite
8908660	8911380	player like iTunes, Spotify, whatever it was.
8911380	8913780	Thank you so much for being a part of the show this week.
8913780	8914900	Appreciate y'all.
8914900	8917860	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
8917860	8918980	Help us spread the word.
8918980	8923300	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to add to the
8923300	8924100	conversation.
8924100	8929780	So a nice five star review on one of those sites, a social media post hosting here at
8929780	8930180	Twitch.
8930180	8933380	I mean, you kind of have to do it live on Sunday night, but hey, we'll take anything
8933380	8935220	we can get that helps spread the word.
8935220	8936900	I really, really appreciate that.
8936900	8939380	The Vaga Network shop is currently down for maintenance.
8939940	8942500	We didn't do a lot of work on it this week because of Thanksgiving.
8942500	8946180	We'll be honest, but hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we'll have some more progress
8946180	8949860	on that front for you guys, especially if anybody's wanting holiday merch.
8949860	8951860	We'll try to get that up pretty soon for you guys.
8953140	8954740	Otherwise, that's all I've got.
8954740	8956580	Thank you guys again for being here tonight.
8956580	8959140	We will be back next week to do it all again.
8959140	8960820	It's time to get the final thoughts.
8960820	8965860	I will start with Dark Sakura because I know she's going to set up for her post stream
8966340	8967220	over at her channel.
8968500	8973780	I have a new intro video that I managed to finish right at the start of Orange House
8973780	8979940	Radio and some temporary AFK and thank you things.
8979940	8984500	I've been really working, trying to get a little bit more skill in Final Cut Pro.
8984500	8986900	And I think I've done something pretty nice.
8987940	8991540	Maybe I have to master the music a little bit better in logic, but I think doing okay.
8992100	9001060	But this is the second week now of weaning off my meds and I am not a pleasant person
9001060	9003140	to be around at a busy IKEA.
9003140	9003940	We'll leave it at that.
9005060	9005940	All right.
9005940	9009700	Well, have a good night, Dark Sakura, and bully some survivors for us.
9010340	9011300	Later taters.
9011300	9011800	All right.
9013460	9015780	We will go now to Loki with his final thought.
9015780	9017140	Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?
9017780	9022980	My final thought is I need to get my new video out and then I got to figure out what to do
9022980	9027380	between now and whenever the new series starts, because I don't know.
9027940	9031940	I'm trying to get them to nail down timing for that, but it's going to be like an awkward
9031940	9033140	couple of weeks or so.
9033940	9036420	It's all up to figure something out until then.
9037060	9037380	All right.
9038100	9040820	And my final thought, I will be back streaming tomorrow.
9040820	9044420	I haven't streamed in a couple of weeks, but I will get back into the post work.
9044420	9048180	Obviously, y'all know things have been going on, but I'm going to get back into the post
9048180	9049940	work habit of streaming.
9049940	9054820	So I'll see you guys around 4.15-4.30 Pacific tomorrow at my channel, Rob Roberts.
9054820	9058100	I'm going to be playing some No Man's Sky, continuing on the first expedition.
9058900	9062500	And I'm already about halfway through it, so I'll kind of pick it up and answer any
9062500	9066180	questions for those of you guys that are starting it the best I can and so forth.
9066180	9067780	So I'll see you guys tomorrow.
9068420	9072820	Also, I want to say thanks again for those downloading the show, listening to the show,
9072820	9074100	supporting the show.
9074100	9074980	It means a lot.
9075620	9078580	And thanks to the emails and the kind words and the love.
9078580	9082500	I could go on and on, but here we come, year 20.
9082500	9085300	We're only about a month away in episode 900, if you can believe it.
9085860	9087460	Only a few weeks away.
9088420	9089540	Have a great week, everybody.
9089540	9091540	Happy Hanukkah to those that celebrate.
9091540	9093140	Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.
9093940	9095860	Here comes December, believe it or not.
9096580	9099940	Get vaccinated so that this Omnicron thing doesn't become an issue.
9099940	9100420	Good Lord.
9100420	9100660	All right.
9100660	9101540	Have a good night, everybody.
9101540	9101780	Bye.
9131540	9133780	See you next week.
9161540	9162260	Bye.
