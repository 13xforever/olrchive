0	13860	Electronic music has come a long way since the late 90s and early 2000s, and I am pumped
13860	17300	to hear that Avex is bringing back its Cybertrance album series.
17300	20960	The combination of Avex tracks, Toshiba EMI, and Konami's in-house tunes account for
20960	23720	a huge amount of my teenage listening and enjoyment.
23720	26220	My rose-colored glasses are on and vivid.
26220	29460	The best part of everything being cyclical is when your favorites come back.
29460	30900	This is my choice of hype for this week.
30900	34060	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
34060	36820	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where Every
36820	38340	Gamer Has a Voice.
38340	42940	Me too, Jason, except my early 20s.
42940	43940	Anyway, hi, everybody.
43940	48180	Hello, everyone out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
48180	50480	where Every Gamer Has a Voice.
50480	57420	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again here with episode number 868 of
57420	61780	our show for this May the 9th of 2021.
61780	68260	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined via the magic of Discord during these quarantiny
68260	72580	times with the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
72580	74780	I wish someone would make me a quarantiny.
74780	76740	I could use a little bit of both.
76740	80180	I was just realizing I was trying to make up a word, and I don't think I did.
80180	88860	I think I actually named a very popular beverage in these trying times, I'm sure.
88860	95220	Well, I think that a bunch of people tried to copyright it to you, but I don't think
95220	99100	that you can copyright the pain of others.
99100	102700	Probably not, although I'm sure someone would try, that's for sure.
102700	104700	Oh, you know someone's tried.
104700	106740	How did the stream go after last week's show?
106740	110440	You were playing some Fantasian for the very first time after last week's OLR.
110440	111440	How was all that?
111440	113900	I really like Fantasian.
113900	114900	It's pretty good.
114900	122720	I just think that I'm going to move that stream to Tuesday night because it's not super exciting,
122720	125500	you know, but it's a good story.
125500	130040	I've really been enjoying it, and I think I'm going to just do a little bit of it like
130040	131040	every Tuesday.
131040	135320	I actually have my schedule posted on Twitch now.
135320	139320	Whether or not I adhere to it is a completely different story.
139320	141720	That's why I don't post one because I know I won't adhere to it.
141720	146300	Well, you know, that's not true because here at VOG Network, we've adhered to this Sunday
146300	151620	night at six o'clock thing for, you know, coming up on 19 years, but it took a long
151620	159160	time to really make that routine, you know, and a lot of people always ask, well, what
159160	161000	would you do on Sunday night if OLR ended?
161000	163300	And I'm like, I literally do not know.
163300	165920	Like 19 years of my life, Sunday night is this.
165920	167920	Like what am I supposed to say?
167920	168920	It's ending?
168920	169920	No, I'm just saying, people ask.
169920	171920	I mean, but I'm just saying, it'll end?
171920	172920	What?
172920	173920	Well.
173920	174920	What words are you speaking?
174920	175920	I don't know this reality.
175920	177080	All good things come to an end eventually.
177080	179880	I don't mean tomorrow or next week, but you know, you never know what's going to happen.
179880	181880	Maybe if I get run over by a Mack truck.
181880	185700	Let's not say those things, but you know, yeah, something could happen.
185700	186700	You never know.
187180	191780	We had some scares in the past and luckily we made it through unscathed and here we are
191780	193300	19 years later.
193300	194300	Yeah.
194300	198140	And some of our listeners, hi listeners, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six
198140	203420	o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog
203420	207700	network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and STA-100 Matt, so our listeners get in
207700	208700	on this too.
208700	213980	STA-100 Matt says, I don't remember my Sunday nights pre-OLR, kind of getting info watching
213980	216740	Simpsons and scrambling to finish homework territory.
216740	217740	Yeah.
217740	222780	I'm trying to think of what my son, Oh, I remember my Sunday nights before OLR.
222780	225660	I used to go to the goth club.
225660	227540	I did on occasion too.
227540	228540	True story.
228540	229540	Yep.
229540	230540	We used to go together.
230540	231540	We were friends before OLR.
231540	233580	So, uh, yeah, we used to go a lot.
233580	234580	Yeah.
234580	240020	But we, but we met through, uh, I met, I think I met Jessica before I met you.
240020	241620	Um, probably.
241620	242620	I don't remember.
242620	243620	Exactly.
244260	245260	Yeah.
245260	246260	I was there that same day at golf land.
246260	251340	I think when I thought that I had met you when we went to play Para Para.
251340	257180	Yes, it was that, Oh, you met, you met probably a go on a girl, uh, a week or two prior or
257180	258340	something before that happened.
258340	262860	I think something like either that, or I met you both at the same time, but yeah, I met
262860	264260	you guys over the Balinese.
264260	265260	Yeah.
265260	268700	And that would have literally been over 20 years ago at this point, which is crazy to
268700	269700	think about.
269700	270700	Isn't it?
270700	271700	Oh my gosh.
271780	276020	There was a lot of guest hosting on, uh, under sedation too long after that.
276020	277020	Yep.
277020	280820	That was the show I was on, um, concurrently with OLR in the beginning, but, um, before
280820	281820	OLR.
281820	284220	Uh, so yeah, it's fun, fun times.
284220	285220	Anyway.
285220	286700	Uh, I would also say hello to tech master Loki.
286700	288020	I'm not sure if he's actually there.
288020	289020	He's blacked out.
289020	290020	I'm here.
290020	291020	Hi.
291020	292020	I'm just eating.
292020	293020	So I figured we don't want to see that.
293020	294020	Yeah, probably not.
294020	295020	That's okay.
295020	296020	Well, how are you Loki?
296020	299140	I've been trying to stretch for time because I thought you were away from keyboard.
299140	300140	My bad.
300140	301140	That's all right.
301580	302580	I'm here.
302580	303580	I'm here.
303580	304580	I can turn the camera on.
304580	307620	I had to rush and do a bunch of things at the last minute.
307620	315500	I had like two minutes to eat food and get the setup and then of course OBS and discord
315500	319100	and my cam software decided to feud it out.
319100	323740	So that delayed my time to have the, uh, yeah.
323740	324740	Been there, done that.
324740	328760	I've, I've, I've been there, done that scarf and down food before, uh, doing a live stream
328760	329760	at one point.
329880	334840	Well, of course everybody wants to know what you eat and, uh, the bacon ultimate cheeseburger.
334840	335840	Of course.
335840	336840	Yes.
336840	339120	Cause I haven't had one of those in like a few weeks.
339120	341680	So I figured, I figured why not?
341680	342680	Good job.
342680	348520	About 15 minutes ago I was, uh, eating freshly smoked tri-tip.
348520	350520	I don't get dinner till after OLR.
350520	354880	I eat late on Sunday nights, so, um, you'll figure it was bacon.
354880	355880	You'd be surprised.
356000	357840	I don't eat that much bacon really.
357840	359680	Um, given the opportunity.
359680	365320	Yes, I will add bacon to the things, but I don't actually eat bacon that often anymore.
365320	366600	So this is a bacon story.
366600	371320	I promise yesterday I had the opportunity to see, um, grandpa Warcraft.
371320	374160	For those of you that remember my old show, horde house, or if you ever listened to the
374160	378800	starboard power coupling, which was here on VOG, you remember grandpa Matt, uh, from both
378800	379800	of those shows.
379800	383760	And I got to see him yesterday, which was great because I really haven't seen a lot
383760	386480	of people during all this, uh, quarantine stuff.
386480	389480	But now that I'm fully vaccinated, he's fully vaccinated.
389480	391000	We were able to hang out yesterday.
391000	395720	Um, and by the way, so he has a, he has a new, um, cabin in the woods that he's at.
395720	399340	And by the way, the cabin in the woods has a hot tub and wifi.
399340	403380	So if we do want to do a VOG hot tub stream, we can probably do one.
403380	405800	So I'm just going to throw that out there.
405800	406800	We broke.
406800	407800	He's great.
407800	408800	He's still doing well.
408800	411480	Thinking about him this morning, going to cut roses.
411480	412480	Yeah.
412480	413480	Love that bitch.
413480	417280	For those of you who don't know, I live in his old house, so it was great to see him
417280	418280	and everything.
418280	422520	Uh, but we went to some nice little restaurant up in, uh, for, for those of you, uh, locals,
422520	426400	Nevada city, which is the cute, cute little town up in the, you know, up in the Hills.
426400	427400	Right.
427400	428940	And, uh, they, they've shot hallmark movies up there.
428940	429940	It's so cute.
429940	431240	We went to one of the little bougie restaurants.
431240	437320	So here's here, I'm, I promise I get to bacon, um, Alan, who is, he's lost, he's lost a lot
437320	439380	of weight during this quarantine stuff.
439380	440380	Many of us have gained.
440380	442900	Alan is lost and he eats very well.
442900	446700	Um, and he ordered as an appetizer, some Brussels sprouts.
446700	451580	Now here's the thing I fucking, I fucking hate Brussels sprouts, but I ate these.
451580	452580	Why?
452580	453580	Why do you hate Brussels sprouts?
453580	454580	They're delicious.
454580	455580	Because they're fucking disgusting.
455580	458560	Except you haven't had them cooked right.
458560	460900	Can I finish my goddamn story?
460900	464740	So the way the bacon's on them, then yes, yes.
464740	469500	So I, but I actually ate the Brussels sprouts here because they, they roasted him, which
469500	472560	was like, the only way I'll eat them is like doing the roasting thing.
472560	477180	And then of course they put like bacon in mixed in with it and it was chef's kiss.
477180	478180	Amazing.
478180	482120	So how will you get Rob to eat Brussels sprouts roasted with bacon?
482120	483120	That's the only way to do it.
483120	488180	I eat my Brussels sprouts with a full pack of bacon in them and heavy cream and cheese
488180	489860	and onions and garlic.
489860	492420	But then I don't think it's really healthy anymore.
492420	493820	Like it's totally keto.
493820	496020	I mean, it's totally like no carbs.
496020	502740	It's just, it's all of the calories and meat and fat, but it's, Oh my God, it's so good.
502740	504460	Tiger class asking a very valid question.
504460	506100	Is the internet good at the cabin?
506100	507100	To which I found out.
507100	508100	Yes.
508100	512640	He gets gigabit up there, which like, I don't know who, why does a cabin in the woods get
512640	514220	better internet than I do?
514220	515220	I don't know.
515220	517420	I was surprised at that too.
517420	520500	I guess you probably have a lot of people running businesses out of their homes.
520500	522920	I have no, that's blew my mind too.
522920	523920	It really did.
523920	524920	So, all right.
524920	530280	Anyway, I actually have access to a hot tub in my neighborhood since my friend who is
530280	536120	on Twitch is Amethyst Rose, which has a lovely large one at her house and has given me free
536120	537960	rain to come over.
537960	543640	So that may be a bonus stream in the future is the OLR hot tub stream, but don't, don't
543640	545280	get it twisted.
545280	550120	Like we're, we're there to literally sit in the hot tub and I'm keeping my shirt on cause
550120	552080	a you don't need to see that on Twitch.
552080	554120	B I sunburn really easily.
554120	557280	It's like, I used to be before it all went gray.
557280	559040	I used to have red hair.
559040	560820	So we burn really easily.
560820	567320	So yeah, but, but we, we will do a hot tub stream if I can convince my ghosts.
567320	571800	After I lost like some of the first bit of my weight, I bought myself a really cute bathing
571800	574280	suit that has like a cat face on it.
574280	576120	And then now it's too big for me.
576120	580840	Plus there will be adventures in hair dye in the next couple of months that involves
580840	581840	the color blue.
581840	582840	Fun.
582840	591520	Um, and so I need to actually get a swim cap to be able to go in chlorinated water.
591520	593720	Me and a shirt, you and a swim cap.
593720	599040	I think Loki should have the sun sunbathing, like sunscreen paint, like, or just do the
599040	600040	Zuckerberg thing.
600040	601040	Yes.
601040	602040	All right.
602040	607600	Anyway, so we're going to have a, we're going to, I've already volunteered everybody.
607600	610040	We're going to have a hot tub stream in the not too distant future.
610040	611040	We'll figure it out.
611240	612240	All right.
612240	616560	Anyway, all right, let's get into it, but we're not here to talk about hot tubs.
616560	623480	We're here to talk about video games and wow, our industry had a lot of fascinating video
623480	624680	game news this week.
624680	628520	Um, I think everybody knows about the court battle that's going on right now between Epic
628520	629520	Games and Apple.
629520	631400	We've talked about that at length on the show.
631400	637760	The reality is we're not going to have a resolution to that whole thing for months because you
637760	640000	know, legal stuff takes time.
640000	642180	Even though the trial, yes, is only a few weeks.
642180	645960	The judge will still take months and months to come up with her decision.
645960	648300	So we don't know what's really going to happen there until later.
648300	653960	But the fascinating part is that it's not even just really Epic and Apple, but all of
653960	660520	these other companies are having secrets that are kind of put out there in open court.
660520	662720	Yes, there are some things that are redacted.
662720	666880	We haven't seen necessarily everything, but we're certainly seeing a lot more and getting
666880	672800	a real peek into the insight of this industry, into how CEOs write their emails.
672800	677160	We're getting insight into the types of things that are discussed, the goals that the long
677160	681640	term goals that these companies have, who's making money, who's not making money.
681640	687660	We're getting a lot of insight that I didn't think many of us thought we'd really get from
687660	688880	a court battle like this.
688880	695000	This probably also helps explain why so many times companies settle out of court.
695000	699640	They don't want to go to this point because of all the testimony, the evidence that gets
699640	701160	entered and all that stuff.
701160	705640	So anyway, let's talk about some of the evidence that's been entered and some of the things
705640	707760	we have learned as a result of that.
707760	709480	Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.
709480	711960	There's several items to talk about and Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.
711960	712960	You had one.
712960	713960	Yeah.
713960	721560	So I'll just go ahead and start off with this, that Epic had offered a $200 million deal
721560	731380	to Sony for, and the quote is, up to four to six PlayStation ports to PC.
731380	738120	They were wanting to target several different video game producers, you know, big triple
738120	746020	A names to try to bring their games over through their store and it's actually stated in their
746020	752100	document that Nintendo was pretty much, quote, a non-starter, end quote.
752100	759100	But their discussions with Microsoft were pretty much complicated because it was competitor
759100	768700	for content, you know, for the, their PC game pass thing was against Epic strategy.
768700	774500	So and on top of that, Sony had already stated that it was looking to bring a whole bunch
774500	777040	of games to PC.
777040	784380	So they, I mean, their first, their first PC port for Horizon Zero Dawn was on Steam.
784380	788400	That's what I was thinking is that we've, we've seen all these PC releases from Sony.
788400	791460	So it's interesting to think that Epic was really making a play for those.
791460	792460	Yeah.
792460	796540	Well, and that in days gone is also coming to Steam.
796540	802660	So it's really looking like Steam is going to be their primary platform.
802660	808600	And from what I understand, it actually is easier to manage their own DLC through Steam.
808600	811660	So that would, that would make sense.
811660	816900	And even, even Microsoft, even though there's that competitive space with game pass, and
816900	821740	I would think also the Windows store is also inherently competition, but yet we've seen
821740	824820	Microsoft actually kind of making moves with Steam as well.
824820	829140	They've kind of relented on the fact that Steam has such a hold on the PC marketplace
829140	833780	that it actually benefits Microsoft to put things like, I'm trying to think what the
833780	836140	most recent thing was that they put on there.
836140	838340	Maybe Halo Master Chief Collection or things like that.
838340	840500	They've actually been putting on Steam.
840500	841500	Which is fascinating.
841500	842500	Sorry.
842500	843500	But I thought that was interesting.
843500	849180	Well, on top of that too, there's another document released during everything that Epic
849180	856740	spent something like $12 million to secure games for its free giveaways.
856740	859100	Yeah.
859100	868220	And it's just, I have this feeling that they're trying to keep some sort of tight reign on
868220	874420	the, on the content that they're able to bring in.
874420	875420	Does that make sense?
875420	876420	Oh yeah.
876420	877420	Oh yeah.
877420	880180	And again, tighter though than some of the other services.
880180	884820	Our chat room is lighting up with comments relating to some of this.
884820	888860	Phoenix 7726 wants to point out that Horizon did go on good old games as well.
888860	890340	So it wasn't like exclusive to Steam.
890340	893700	I thought at first it was only on Steam though, but I could be wrong.
893700	897940	You may be right that it was, I thought, but I thought maybe after a little bit of time,
897940	898940	it went to both.
898940	900660	But anyway, I could be wrong.
900660	902180	And it doesn't necessarily matter.
902180	903180	It's not on Epic.
903180	904180	True.
904180	907180	That's the point is it went somewhere other than Epic.
907180	908180	True.
908180	909180	Fair enough.
909180	913460	Quest Buster in chat says, I'm not sure that in every indie was happy to see what they
913460	916140	were being paid by Epic to be on their store.
916140	917140	Oh yeah.
917140	918140	Yeah.
918140	919140	I found that fascinating too.
919140	920140	So it's out there.
920140	925660	Oh, I'll take half the price, half the price of the lowest tier one that they have except
925660	926660	for the zero one.
926660	929220	I'm not taking zero, but I'll put pixel poops.
929220	930220	Number two on there.
930220	932100	I'll take a quarter of that.
932100	936660	You know, he's paid me $12,000 and you can have, you could give that game away for free.
936660	937660	I'm cool.
937660	941020	You out there, you out there, Tim Sweeney, you part of the oil army listening to this
941020	942020	shit.
942580	946660	Probably even sweeten the deal even more and undercut me even more on that.
946660	949340	Still say yes.
949340	950340	I love that.
950340	952260	Tweet at him, get his attention.
952260	956340	But yeah, it's, but the comment is still true.
956340	957340	What our listener said.
957340	961300	It's probably really alarming for some of the indies to see like those that made more,
961300	966120	those that didn't make much because some of those games, like I think the Batman trilogy,
966120	967120	like I could be wrong.
967120	970080	I don't have the chart in front of me, but I remember that one was like a million bucks
970080	971080	or something.
971140	972140	A lot of money.
972140	973140	And Arkham was like 15.
973140	975140	It was a 1.5 million.
975140	979340	That was a lot of money, you know, especially for a game that wasn't particularly new as
979340	980340	a few years old.
980340	983960	And most of the games they give away are old, but not all of them are.
983960	985240	Some of them are new.
985240	987120	And so they paid a lot less for that.
987120	992680	Now, granted, it takes a much larger team to build a Batman Arkham Asylum than it does
992680	997520	to build, you know, some of the indie titles, but still to kind of see that in the numbers
997520	1001400	and really see the differences in the numbers was really shocking.
1001400	1004360	I definitely like if you haven't seen that document, look it up.
1004360	1007560	Obviously, it would be very boring for me to sit here and read the Excel spreadsheet
1007560	1008680	aloud you.
1008680	1010000	You all follow the industry.
1010000	1013400	I'm sure you're going to Google it and look that up if you haven't already, because it
1013400	1014960	was all over Twitter and social media.
1014960	1016760	But I thought that was fascinating.
1016760	1020280	And this is this is that's exactly the type of document I didn't think we were going to
1020280	1024760	get out of this trial and that probably everybody would have liked to avoid.
1024760	1026720	It was interesting.
1026720	1029320	So anyway, that dark soccer.
1029320	1030320	Thank you for that.
1030320	1035080	Loki, you've been following some of the secret secrets unlocked as well, right?
1035080	1036080	Yeah.
1036080	1042320	So, you know, apparently during the court case, Apple is trying to get Epic to admit
1042320	1046760	that there's like some questionable content on their storefront only because they have
1046760	1047760	the itch.io app.
1047760	1049640	And we know what kind of junk's on there.
1049640	1050640	My game.
1050640	1052640	So and porn.
1052640	1053640	There's porn on there, too.
1053640	1060000	But, you know, because I guess since that's accessible on their storefront, they're kind
1060000	1062560	of trying to say that it's it's part of it.
1062560	1068940	But they're, I don't know, very clever play when you consider that itch.io was just added
1068940	1072000	to Epic like a week before the trial started.
1072000	1075480	And they even kind of got called out on that is that, well, you just put itch.io on the
1075480	1078040	store conveniently before trial.
1078040	1082920	And then that turned into this whole so Epic is fine with porn being on its marketplace.
1083200	1086080	It's a very interesting tactic, very, very interesting.
1086080	1089240	Anyway, I was fascinated by that, but go ahead.
1089240	1092560	And then also, I thought it was interesting that they've made nine billion dollars on
1092560	1095680	Fortnite between twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen.
1095680	1102000	So that's that's only I mean, that's ridiculous, just nine billion dollars in like a couple
1102000	1103000	of years.
1103000	1105200	And I'm assuming that's just grown since then.
1105200	1112440	So I guess that's why they want to get it on the Apple store to make even more billions.
1113440	1117440	They got to start getting in the positive dollars fast, right?
1117440	1119440	Yeah, pretty much.
1119440	1124440	Were you surprised to hear that the epic store is losing money?
1124440	1132440	Yeah, but I mean, it's just it's not that old and, you know, it takes a while for businesses
1132440	1140680	to turn a profit, and especially if they're even giving away the free stuff, if that necessarily
1140680	1145600	brings people to the epic store to maybe try Fortnite or something like that, I'm sure
1145600	1149400	they more than make up for it with the profits that they're making from that.
1149400	1152120	So it's it's more of like a loss leader, I guess.
1152120	1157120	Yeah, it's it's the digital version of what Black Friday is all about to retailers.
1157120	1161560	You sell that cheap ass two hundred dollar TV or whatever it is to get people in the
1161560	1166360	door to then look at the other things that are in there that maybe aren't as good on
1166360	1167360	a sale.
1167360	1170800	This is this is something that Fry's Electronics was notorious for.
1170800	1171800	Rest in peace, right?
1171800	1175000	If you've ever been to a Fry's Electronics and I'm sure there's other stores like this,
1175000	1176000	but Fry's especially.
1176000	1179960	So you walk into Fry's, you buy something like one of these loss leaders, even though
1179960	1182760	there's maybe five or ten of them available on Black Friday.
1182760	1183760	But then what happens?
1183760	1186820	You go to stand in line and wait for a checkout.
1186820	1189880	How long is that little tunnel?
1189880	1192600	Not not literally a tunnel, but you are surrounded on the left and right.
1192600	1194600	How long is that little tunnel to wait to check out?
1194600	1199200	It is literally like a queue to a line at Disneyland.
1199200	1202960	It is extremely long and wrapping around Black Friday.
1202960	1207520	You have to find the end of the line with a dude that has a giant like a bouquet of
1207520	1212800	balloons, you know, saying the line ends here and it just winds through the entire store.
1212800	1216960	I mean, you're literally forced through an aisle.
1216960	1220760	That is shit you don't need, but you want it anyway.
1220760	1223400	It's like I don't need this cotton candy machine.
1223400	1227480	I don't need this hot dog warmer that they have for convenience stores, but they have
1227480	1231920	it in the store and I'm kind of considering it walking past it.
1231920	1234080	But you know, I don't really need that.
1234080	1236840	Oh, hey, look at all of these cool USB things.
1236840	1243200	I could use some more USB cables and ooh, and some balls, you know, you know, some of
1243200	1244200	that.
1244200	1248080	I mean, there's lots of stuff anyway.
1248080	1249080	That's it.
1249080	1250080	And I love Fry's.
1250080	1255280	Honestly, none of us really complained about what they were doing, but it is very obvious
1255280	1256280	what they are.
1256280	1259240	Maybe if I had kids, I'd complain because there's a lot of fucking candy in that aisle.
1259240	1261240	But anyway, I digress.
1261240	1262360	It was fine with kids.
1262360	1267000	It was it was a great store just to walk around and check out all the weird stuff and especially
1267000	1271120	like, you know, going in there, they had all these like bargain bins just like when you
1271120	1272120	walked in.
1272120	1273120	It was just all over the place.
1273120	1277820	All these things that they were like as seen on TV or just it's like, ooh, ooh, I'll look
1277820	1279580	at all this like canned air.
1279580	1281220	Ooh, look at all these batteries.
1281220	1283420	I could buy like a 50 pack of batteries.
1283420	1284420	It's so cheap.
1284420	1287140	It's like that's that's exactly that's exactly it.
1287140	1291380	So what we're looking at with Epic Games and that's what it's it's the digital version
1291380	1292380	of that.
1292380	1296820	You put a loss leader like a free game to get that thing installed on somebody's computer,
1296820	1301140	the Epic Games launcher, and then, oh, look at all these game sales that are going on
1301140	1302140	or exclusives.
1302140	1306020	Y'all want some Borderlands three, OK, you know, all this stuff in the store.
1306020	1309500	And to obviously, to some extent, it has worked.
1309500	1310500	Yeah.
1310500	1311500	Some interesting comments in chat.
1311500	1312500	D.J.
1312500	1314380	Rama S. says, you see what they did with Discord.
1314380	1319380	Oh, I always said that was this still blows my mind to this day how this didn't work,
1319380	1323180	that Discord put this free chat app on everybody's computer.
1323180	1325100	They were like basically like, oh, slack.
1325100	1327220	Oh, we're going to make a free version of that.
1327220	1328780	Oh, team, team, team speak.
1328780	1329780	What the hell was it?
1329780	1330780	Ventrilo.
1330780	1331900	We're going to make a free version of that.
1332900	1338540	And you put this thing on the computers free and then they put a game store in it.
1338540	1341740	And I thought that was the smartest thing I think I'd ever seen a company do.
1341740	1344700	Yet it flopped and they no longer sell games.
1344700	1345700	Unbelievable.
1345700	1346780	It's unbelievable to me.
1346780	1351580	But I think I don't think they swung hard enough with that.
1351580	1355020	And I know that's weird to say because I think if they'd swung harder, it might have annoyed
1355020	1356540	some of us.
1356540	1358540	But I think that's where they maybe made the mistake.
1358540	1361500	But anyway, I think that's very interesting.
1361500	1365300	Let's see, Questbuster says it's all about getting the bodies or Epic's case, the fresh
1365300	1368740	user accounts into their store and so on and so on.
1368740	1372940	So anyway, Loki, a few more tidbits that came out of the courtroom.
1372940	1378460	Yeah, so let's see what else we have here.
1378460	1384260	Well, we talked about the exclusives and how much money they had there for that.
1384260	1389460	So it was like one billion dollars, which is ridiculous.
1389460	1392380	And I don't know, that's all it pretty much had.
1392380	1396940	There's there's a lot of drama going on that I'm not really paying attention to right now.
1396940	1399300	Honestly, I don't really care how it ends up.
1399300	1407300	I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but like it's not really beneficial to me.
1407300	1413580	Whatever it does, whatever your YouTubers, your Twitter followers, your podcasts, whatever
1413580	1416700	they're saying about this case, it doesn't matter at the end of the day.
1416700	1417700	Like I hate this.
1417700	1418700	This is the reality.
1418940	1419940	It doesn't matter.
1419940	1421660	It's going to be up to this judge.
1421660	1425340	And whatever happens will be a very interesting thing.
1425340	1427660	But we'll find out in a few months what happens with that.
1427660	1428660	So there you go.
1428660	1429660	All right.
1429660	1433220	Before we get to our gaming weeks, let me get to another couple of comments here.
1433220	1439100	Phoenix 7726 says, I kind of wonder how disco makes money at this point, Discord, not Star
1439100	1441220	Trek Discovery in this case, I think.
1441220	1443180	Those Nitro subs can't be that much.
1443180	1446860	They don't advertise and servers cost money to maintain.
1446860	1450540	I think they're making more Nitro subs than you might give them credit for.
1450540	1453820	I actually have the Nitro sub because I wanted to boost.
1453820	1458700	It only takes one person's boost to boost the server a little bit to get better voice
1458700	1459700	quality.
1459700	1461740	And I feel like I use it so much.
1461740	1466540	Maybe I ought to kick them a little bit of money, but I think it did come out not that
1466540	1467540	long ago.
1467540	1472140	That is where Discord's making a chunk of its money, but you're not wrong in thinking
1472140	1474660	they're probably not making enough money.
1475380	1479100	And we have a pair of stories coming up later that might give some insight into how are
1479100	1481820	they going to make more money later on.
1481820	1483540	We'll get into that a little later.
1483540	1488980	So DJ Rama S in chat says, plus investments from venture capitalists.
1488980	1492000	Yes, investments in the future is a big one.
1492000	1494260	And again, we have more coming up on that later.
1494260	1495260	So we'll get to that later.
1495260	1498580	But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1498580	1501400	been playing this week and our impressions thereof.
1501400	1502900	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1502900	1504300	What have you been playing?
1504340	1507540	I played a few more things than just Animal Crossing.
1507540	1510180	I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight and I've been streaming.
1510180	1517500	I actually had a fun, if me, terrible gameplay moment of going into Puddin's channel and
1517500	1523380	doing a custom game where it was a race to see if we could pop the hatch, close the hatch,
1523380	1530340	which starts the end game countdown, see if I could hook them before the timer went out,
1530340	1531460	which, of course, I failed.
1531460	1533180	I'm not very good.
1533180	1534180	That was pretty fun, though.
1534260	1536420	I think I'm going to do stuff like that in the future.
1536620	1537660	That's fun.
1537860	1543860	And then I also started Fantasia after last night's episode.
1544060	1546660	And I really like that game.
1546860	1550860	It really just smacks of old school SNES Final Fantasy stuff.
1551060	1553500	And it's the music is great.
1553700	1560860	I love that the backgrounds and objects are hand-built diorama pieces.
1561060	1563340	And you can really even on the rendered
1563540	1569060	stuff, you can see the texture built into those those other items.
1569260	1573660	And I love I love the story so far, too,
1573860	1577940	although I did think that the main character was a robot at first.
1578140	1581580	And I had a very sad moment right at the beginning, but I'm not going to spoil.
1581780	1585820	It's a fairly new game, but I'll be playing it on Tuesdays.
1585820	1587940	I'll have some information posted somewhere.
1588140	1590740	I forgot what my schedule is already.
1591940	1595220	But well, after OLR tonight is one of them.
1595420	1601180	Well, yeah, but after OLR tonight, I am debuting a
1601380	1606260	I mean, it's still me sucking it dead by daylight, but it has a fancy title now.
1606460	1612020	It's Monday Midnight Massacre, OK, because on the East Coast it'll be
1612220	1615060	Monday by the time we're pretty much done, OK?
1615260	1616980	I've even made music for it.
1617140	1621020	And some kind soul uploaded every sound
1621020	1623700	effect from one of the earlier builds of Dead by Daylight.
1623700	1625740	So I was able to incorporate some of it in my music.
1625940	1629300	But I wrote I did everything else myself.
1629500	1630340	I did the melody.
1630540	1632300	I did the
1632500	1635420	and it's an homage since I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight.
1635420	1637380	It's an homage to the theme of the game.
1637580	1638780	Quite the musician lately.
1638980	1640340	Been doing great. I'm trying.
1640540	1644780	I mean, I've I've really enjoyed I mean,
1644940	1647660	I think that my streaming has pretty much
1647860	1655220	motivated me to get a lot better in Logic Pro, which is what I use to make my music.
1655420	1661140	And for those on stream who are watching watching with us live,
1661340	1668140	I have myself a nice new MIDI keyboard and it's an Akai Mini,
1668340	1671820	the MPK Mini, if anyone wants to know.
1672020	1674220	But I've had just a really, a really great time.
1674260	1677780	I feel like I've found some inspiration.
1677980	1679420	Love it.
1679900	1683460	Looking in chat over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network,
1683660	1688220	Phoenix 7726 is asking, have any of the hosts played the new Resident Evil?
1688420	1690100	I'm assuming Loki hasn't.
1690300	1692260	So I think it's a no from all of us.
1692460	1694940	But I did I know it's not the same as playing it.
1694940	1698020	But I did watch some Twitch streams of it for quite a bit of time.
1698020	1700820	Like I actually watched like at least an hour, if not a little more.
1701020	1703660	And I even watched a YouTube as well to kind of get a sense of it.
1703900	1709500	I'm I think it might be a little too intense for me just on the scare front
1709500	1712060	and all that stuff, like I just kind of know what I can handle and what might be
1712060	1715820	a bit much and some of those scenes I watched, although I think the characters
1716020	1719580	are really well done and, you know, knowing that, you know,
1719780	1723180	tying it back to Dead by Daylight, we know that Resident Evil is going to be
1723180	1726420	the next chapter and that there is going to be a new killer from the Resident Evil
1726620	1730940	series, I really don't mind if it's a killer from Resident Evil eight.
1731140	1733620	I know there are people out there that really want to have Wesker
1733820	1735940	or Mr. X or something.
1736140	1740900	There's a big rumor out there that it is the the witch trio from Resident Evil eight
1740900	1742820	is the killer because there's some hints in the video.
1743020	1745100	And the five for the fifth anniversary
1745300	1748500	looks like one of the hand size that the witch daughters use.
1748700	1750300	And I would be totally OK with that.
1750300	1752420	I think that would be a really cool killer.
1752620	1757020	I think Lady Dimitrescu we got I still wish we had a Code Veronica theme.
1757220	1760980	I as much as I know some people would just hate it.
1760980	1763140	I would love Lady Dimitrescu as a killer.
1763220	1767140	I just think like the idea of like a vampire, because we don't have a vampire
1767340	1769940	in Dead by Daylight yet, so it seems very, very fit.
1770140	1771900	So, I mean, we'll see. We'll see.
1772100	1775660	And obviously she is an iconic character, but we'll see.
1775660	1777140	Obviously, Resident Evil also has other icons.
1777340	1780300	You know, when it when you get to survivor, it gets a lot harder to choose.
1780500	1785620	And I wonder if it won't do the Stranger Things thing and actually give us
1785820	1790260	two survivors. I wonder if we won't have Chris and Jill or something.
1790460	1792180	But well, it's a matter of time.
1792180	1793940	We find out in a couple of weeks, right?
1794140	1796260	I think there are fifth anniversary streams in a couple of weeks.
1796460	1799220	So, yeah. All right.
1799420	1803100	Phoenix 7726 says, I bet a shitload of people want Lady D.
1803300	1805780	And then DJ Rama S says, just to be stepped on.
1805980	1809420	Yes, I think there are quite a few people that like to see it.
1809620	1812500	Whatever the reason is, I just I you know what?
1812700	1814980	If we're going to meme, let's fucking meme.
1815140	1820580	OK, like put her in dead by daylight and then let the user content flow, but we'll
1820580	1822780	see what happens, we'll see. All right.
1822980	1825300	Moving on with our gaming weeks, Loki.
1825500	1828660	All right, so this week it's it's been all
1828860	1832900	Minecraft for the most part, been still playing on the server stuff,
1833100	1836660	building more farms, staying up late, doing that kind of thing,
1836860	1840860	and then preparing to build my shop in the shopping district.
1841060	1845980	So lots of preparation, like on my creative
1846180	1849060	world, that's kind of a copy of the seed that they have.
1849260	1855020	So I've been designing it there so I can build it in the actual game.
1855220	1858340	So once that's done, I think that'll be kind of I don't know if that's going to be
1858340	1859980	part of episode two or episode three.
1859980	1861660	I haven't decided yet to go through all
1861660	1863740	the footage I have right now and see what I've got.
1863740	1867340	If it's enough content to do that, I would like to have that as a kind
1867340	1870540	of build montage in there, but maybe for another episode or something.
1870740	1872060	So we'll see.
1872260	1875020	But yeah, I just have to work more on the video editing stuff.
1875220	1876620	I know it's like.
1876820	1879740	I've got a nagging feeling, you know, it's
1879940	1883860	not outside of my mind any time I'm playing like I got to edit this video.
1884060	1886260	So hopefully that'll be coming soon.
1886460	1888100	I'm hoping sometime maybe next week.
1888300	1891340	And then aside from that, Orna just been playing more of that,
1891540	1895180	you know, taking over territories when I go places, that kind of thing.
1895380	1896700	Nice.
1896900	1899900	My gaming week, I also have been back in Orna a little bit.
1900340	1902020	I caught some areas out in the wilderness
1902220	1904900	that nobody had on my way up to Matt's place.
1905100	1906540	So that was fun.
1907020	1909500	And continuing with the GPS games, playing Pokemon Go.
1909500	1911620	I'm still not done with Meryl day.
1911820	1914580	And I've already up to five shinies, which is pretty good.
1914780	1916140	And a couple of good ones, too.
1916140	1919260	So I wish Meryl was a little bit of a better Pokemon in the meta game.
1919460	1920780	But maybe you guys know something. I don't.
1920780	1922740	Maybe Meryl's OK in the great league or something.
1922940	1923980	I don't know.
1924180	1927100	So I've been working on that a little bit.
1927300	1928820	Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight.
1928820	1929620	That's kind of my new.
1930540	1931940	This is the first week where I can say
1932140	1935660	I haven't played Final Fantasy 14 because all my friends left.
1935860	1938660	Shane's super into Monster Hunter with Dom.
1938660	1941100	Dominic, who we also play Final Fantasy 14 with.
1941300	1944180	I think Ray, who we also play that game with, went on a trip.
1944380	1945900	However,
1946100	1949780	the Final Fantasy 14 gang will reunite on Friday
1949980	1953700	because Fan Fest is, Virtual Fan Fest is Friday.
1953900	1957860	And yes, we already know about the expansion, but we're going to get the rest
1957900	1960020	of the details on the expansion on Friday.
1960220	1962860	What is the other class that is going to be in the game?
1962860	1964100	What are some of the other features?
1964300	1968140	So basically we get all the details of the expansion will be out on Friday.
1968340	1972620	If they allow us to co-stream, we may do another thing on VOG.
1972820	1973940	So you'll have to stay tuned to Twitter.
1974060	1975780	We don't know if it's allowable or not.
1975780	1976940	They kind of announced it at the last
1976940	1978940	minute last time and they'll probably do it this time.
1979140	1983380	But if it is allowed to co-stream, we will probably do that at VOG on Friday night.
1983580	1985660	So keep an eye out for it.
1985860	1988580	To which Bobby Blackwell says Final Fantasy 14 dead game.
1988780	1992180	No, it's just one of those, you know, we've kind of burned out this content.
1992380	1993700	We're ready for new stuff.
1993900	1996820	Everybody will be back once the new patch is out.
1997020	2002300	And Phoenix7726 says, I've heard that Final Fantasy 14 is doing better than WoW these days.
2002500	2005180	I really get the sense that is the case, too.
2005180	2006900	And I don't I don't want to pit the games
2006900	2010740	against each other because both have very strong, very loyal fan bases.
2010940	2013780	But I think this is just one of those things where
2013900	2018420	WoW has been getting outplayed a little bit because they've been very
2018620	2022020	comfortable being the leading MMO for a long time.
2022220	2026100	I don't think they're used to another company pushing out the content as
2026300	2029460	regular and that's one thing that 14 has done very well.
2029660	2032340	They're pushing out content regularly.
2032540	2035980	And that's something Blizzard's kind of slipped on and I think it's noticeable.
2036180	2038580	However, of course, we have WoW Classic.
2038580	2039380	There's a lot going on.
2039380	2041460	We'll talk about that later in the show and stuff.
2041500	2044420	And I don't mean to totally like I'm not trying to like shit on WoW or anything.
2044420	2045300	That's not what I'm trying to do.
2045300	2047100	They're both good games in their own regards.
2047300	2049100	But I just think that Blizzard, you know,
2049300	2053060	is getting challenged a little bit on the make more content front.
2053260	2055020	So anyhow,
2055220	2057460	the reason why I was saying all this, I haven't been playing 14.
2057460	2060140	I've been playing a little more Dead by Daylight to fill in the time.
2060340	2064340	Believe it or not, I'm playing I'm enjoying playing Survivor a lot more than I used to.
2064540	2067500	So I do go back and forth between Survivor and Killer.
2067700	2071340	I got my favorite Survivor and Jamie's least favorite.
2071420	2072420	No, I don't think it's your least favorite.
2072620	2074700	But you love to make fun of Dwight.
2074900	2075820	I love Dwight.
2076020	2078860	No, Dwight's just, Dwight's kind of generic.
2079060	2081020	The character I hate is Bill.
2081220	2082580	Oh, I don't care for Bill either.
2082780	2087140	You know, I think as much as everybody loves Ash from Evil Dead,
2087140	2088620	I think he's extraordinary.
2088620	2089460	Ash is terrible.
2089660	2091900	I think he's extraordinarily out of place in Dead by Daylight.
2091900	2092660	I got to be honest.
2092860	2096020	I was just watching people play him in his
2096220	2100980	perks and he is really difficult to be a good survivor on, especially as a starter.
2100980	2104020	Yeah, I mean, he's novel is what he is.
2104220	2105660	He's novel.
2105860	2110860	If there were any deadites in the game, then, yeah, I'd have more of a reason to be there.
2111060	2114380	But I think I'm working on the base survivors just to get their perks.
2114580	2117460	I'll probably I'm almost I'm level thirty nine on Dwight.
2117460	2121500	So I get his last perk in one more level and then I'll probably move on to a Meg.
2121500	2124500	I'll probably just go right across top row, go to Meg, then go to Claudette,
2124700	2127460	then maybe go to Jake. I don't know if Jake has anything I really want, though.
2127460	2129300	I may go to Fengmen at that point.
2129340	2131820	If I do it, I'm actually going to start with Claudette.
2132020	2135300	I started I started with Claudette, too, so I could get self-care.
2135300	2137020	But then I realized that self-care is
2137020	2140180	kind of overrated because you're going to be flowing in medical kits.
2140180	2142420	So if you want to heal yourself, just bring a med kit.
2142620	2146180	Either that or I'm going to do the Meglet.
2146380	2148220	Yeah, Meg's Meg's makes a lot of fun, too.
2148420	2152260	So anyway, I've been doing that and playing survivor and killer.
2152460	2157260	I will say, too, I cameoed on Alan's stream on Wednesday.
2157260	2160460	So he does his Taylor Swift with friends.
2160460	2163500	That's what they call surviving with friends, SWF Swift.
2163700	2165940	So he did his Taylor Swift with friends
2166140	2169620	on Wednesday and I played for like two hours with him.
2169820	2172300	And I wasn't a total flop.
2172300	2174820	Like there was a couple of matches where he died and I didn't.
2174820	2176020	And that felt really good.
2176220	2178300	So it was good.
2178500	2179700	So, yeah, I've been playing lots of Dead by Daylight.
2179900	2182500	OK, have I been playing anything new, though?
2182700	2184140	Yes, I have something.
2184340	2185340	It's new to me, though.
2185340	2191140	It's not a new game, but it is new on Xbox because it just came out this week
2191340	2195140	on Xbox and it came out on Xbox Game Pass as a result of that.
2195340	2199820	So I have been spending quite a bit of time with Dragon Quest Builders, too.
2200020	2202140	So it's funny that Loki brought off mine,
2202340	2204740	brought up Minecraft because there's a lot of parallels, obviously.
2204740	2206660	Like, you know, there's a lot of the Minecraft
2206660	2208460	formula that you have in Dragon Quest Builders.
2208660	2212460	And I played quite a bit of the first game and I liked it a bit.
2212460	2214380	I didn't love it,
2214580	2218260	but I'm really enjoying my experience with Dragon Quest Builders, too.
2218460	2221340	The nice thing is, like most Dragon Quest games,
2221340	2223300	doesn't matter if you never played the first one.
2223500	2227420	Dragon Quest Builders, too, will help you out with the system and all that stuff.
2227620	2229740	And, you know, it starts you from scratch
2229740	2231780	and the stories don't really relate or anything.
2231980	2234940	So I think they may I think they actually might.
2235140	2238860	But it's OK if you don't know, like I'm not I'm not lost or anything in the story.
2239020	2242620	I think generally you're just kind of in that bad, good guy,
2242820	2245740	defeated bad guy a long time ago there, you're all caught up.
2245940	2249180	Like it's like that's that's all you need to know the first game.
2249380	2251700	And I'm I'm liking the fact that these
2251900	2254780	worlds you go to are really big and there's a lot to do.
2254980	2259340	And there's a lot more like creative share stuff in there.
2259340	2261140	I'm surprised some of the stuff that gets
2261340	2263460	on Square Enix's online platform in that game.
2263660	2265780	But all right. But yeah, I'm enjoying the game.
2265820	2269340	It's a very nice just kind of plop down and play for
2269540	2271820	almost hours because you start to lose sense of time.
2272020	2273860	And I'm I'm still in the first
2274060	2278500	not the not the shore you wash up on, but the first world after that, the farming
2278500	2281580	world, I'm still in that farming world and I've sunk quite a bit of time into the game.
2281780	2284740	So, yeah, it's
2284940	2286300	it's it's been enjoyable.
2286500	2288580	I like Dragon Quest Builders, too.
2288780	2290900	You know, ask me again. Ask me if I finish it.
2290900	2292780	Do I like it enough to finish it? We'll see.
2292980	2293860	I'll check that out.
2294020	2296540	Anyway, I know a lot of people were recommending that to me in Discord,
2296540	2299540	so good call on that because you're right, I enjoy the game.
2299740	2301180	So Dragon Quest Builders 2.
2301380	2303020	All right.
2303220	2304740	That's it for our gaming weeks.
2304940	2307900	So I think we will get into some other news.
2308100	2310420	So let's start with Loki.
2310620	2312980	Yeah, so this was a pleasant surprise.
2313180	2318060	We got a trailer from Nintendo for a brand new game called Game Builder Garage.
2318260	2321500	And what Game Builder Garage appears to be
2321500	2325300	is a lot of folks may not remember Labo.
2325500	2330100	So Labo, you have the games that were kind of included with it.
2330300	2332140	Hold on. Quarantine hasn't been that long.
2332340	2333980	Like Labo was like a toy.
2334180	2339900	OK, so what I mean by Labo is you may not know in Labo you can create your own things.
2340100	2343340	OK, so there is actually like programming
2343540	2346780	and stuff you can do within Labo that's kind of similar to this.
2346980	2351300	It's block based and you kind of, you know, drag stuff together to
2351820	2353100	basically create code.
2353300	2359620	And one key hit that this is based on that is I believe, if I remember correctly,
2359820	2365380	that robot that's in the trailer is actually in Labo, if I remember correctly.
2365580	2369220	But yeah, so basically it's kind of what they're doing is they're taking like
2369420	2376780	the programming that they had with Labo and basically bringing it to a broader
2376780	2381500	market to allow people to code and make their own games within it.
2381540	2383220	So that's pretty awesome that they do
2383420	2386820	that and they kind of walk you through on how to do stuff.
2387020	2388820	I think it's a great thing to get more
2389020	2391260	people into coding, even like the block based stuff.
2391460	2393660	I mean, Scratch, that's how a lot of people get started.
2393860	2395500	So it looks pretty cool.
2395500	2396900	It's supposed to be coming out, I think,
2397100	2401500	looks like in June, June 11th for 30 bucks.
2401700	2403580	What a pleasant surprise from Nintendo.
2403580	2404460	Very interesting.
2404460	2405940	I don't think anyone saw this coming.
2405980	2408260	You know, we haven't had any leaks or anything.
2408460	2413060	And also they're doing you know, this is again and this is not the first time
2413260	2415700	because they did this not that long ago with another game.
2415900	2418900	And I can't remember what it was in the moment, but somebody in shadow, correct me.
2419100	2421620	They're really only giving a five or six week lead time on this.
2421820	2424900	You know, it's kind of like, hey, you're thinking, was it Paper Mario?
2425100	2427420	Paper Mario? Yes, yes, very much with that.
2427620	2429420	And the other cool thing about this, too,
2429620	2432780	is because you were designing your own graphics and stuff like that,
2432980	2435860	they also have USB mouse support for it as well.
2436060	2438780	So you can plug it into the dock if you
2438980	2441860	have that set up to actually draw and stuff in there.
2441860	2442660	So that's pretty cool.
2442860	2446300	It sounds like this might be a very rich kind of system.
2446500	2450340	It's looking like it is because this is a successor of sorts to like Labo.
2450540	2454180	Like you say, I see the Mario Maker interest in this as well.
2454380	2457100	This is a very interesting path for Nintendo to be taking.
2457100	2458020	But I think this is great.
2458220	2460820	You know, it's their own kind of like dreams sort of thing.
2460820	2464900	And they seem to yeah, they seem to be pushing it more than Sony push Dreams.
2464940	2468180	I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show is that I
2468380	2472380	it seems like a really crucial error that Sony did not push Dreams harder.
2472380	2473620	I'm really shocked at that.
2473820	2474620	They really didn't.
2474820	2478860	It's such a good like piece of software, but it's just like nobody knows about it.
2479060	2482100	And like you can do like so much stuff with it.
2482300	2485180	It's just they didn't advertise it at all.
2485380	2489540	I hope that I hope they do a mulligan and we'll try to make a PS5 version that's
2489740	2492420	a little, you know, bigger, bigger, better, stronger,
2492420	2494380	and that it actually gets the promotion it deserves.
2494380	2496580	Because I don't I don't understand that at all.
2496580	2499820	Why Sony didn't push that the way they push LittleBigPlanet.
2500020	2504740	They did sort of I mean, they did cover it like it was in like several of their E3
2504740	2508580	events, but it was always like some weird like artsy thing that they did with it
2508780	2513220	where like they're controlling puppets or they're like playing music or something
2513220	2514940	like that. It doesn't really showcase.
2514940	2516180	Let me make it very plain.
2516180	2516980	Let me be very plain.
2517180	2520780	They didn't showcase Dreams the way Nintendo is showcasing this.
2520900	2524580	No, it is it is very clear what this is all about from the way Nintendo showcased
2524780	2529060	it, but Nintendo in many ways is also a master of messaging.
2529260	2530460	And that's not a knock on Sony.
2530660	2531660	Sony's hell.
2531660	2535740	We all remember that E3 press conference when they showed those videos that just
2535940	2539660	dunked on Xbox and threw them out in the dumpster like it was it was shocking.
2539740	2543820	So we can't say the Sony Sony's great at messaging when they want to do it.
2544020	2547060	Nintendo's, you know, really, really, really good at it.
2547260	2552140	And Microsoft, you know, as much as that event was 10 years ago and a lot's changed
2552140	2555860	with Microsoft and Microsoft's great at messaging in their own way as well.
2556060	2558660	But my my my real point is, is that, you know,
2558860	2560660	Sony should have pushed dreams more.
2560860	2564180	And I think with this and Nintendo, we get the short time frame.
2564300	2566220	But I think there's going to be a big audience for this.
2566420	2568180	Again, it's kind of like one of those like game.
2568180	2570340	I didn't know I needed until you showed it to me.
2570460	2572260	Even I'm interested in it and I don't
2572260	2575380	necessarily sit there and make a lot of games, but I kind of want to play other
2575380	2578460	people's games, and that's the other thing that's interesting about Nintendo is
2578460	2580340	that, you know, we're seeing all these comments in chat.
2580540	2582540	S.H.A. 100 Matt saying, I'm waiting for
2582540	2584940	someone to make a recreation of Mother 3 in this.
2585060	2587820	And just as the person goes to share it, the game deletes it.
2588020	2591380	DJ Rama S says, finally, O.L.R. the RPG.
2591580	2595300	Bobby Blackwolf says, everyone's like, don't like your minimum wage job.
2595500	2596700	Learn to code, lol.
2596820	2598060	So now they can learn to code.
2598060	2599580	And then they're like, we're short staff.
2599580	2600620	Nobody wants to work for us.
2600820	2603820	Well, that's a that's that's a whole other Oprah, as they say.
2603980	2605260	But great game.
2605460	2608780	They can release your game, make no money off of it and still have your job.
2608780	2610700	There you go. Well, yeah, the Nintendo thing.
2610900	2615820	Well, I'm I'm it seems almost certain you're not going to make money off these games.
2616020	2617020	No, of course not.
2617220	2619660	And I think also one thing we kind of know
2619660	2622980	about it is that you're going to be able to share your creations with friends.
2623180	2625380	But it doesn't sound like they have a public
2625380	2627660	posting forum like Mario Maker or something.
2627820	2629100	Well, we could be wrong.
2629300	2630900	We don't have all the details yet.
2631100	2633180	I'm hoping that they have like sort of codes.
2633260	2635060	I mean, they love their codes.
2635060	2637460	You know, if they have some sort of share thing.
2637460	2639660	But like, it would be nice if it was like a little big planet
2639660	2641740	where I could search for something and find things.
2641740	2642980	But like, I doubt it.
2642980	2644060	I doubt it, too.
2644060	2644780	We're talking about.
2644780	2648780	But again, here is where and yet again, and here's where I'll knock Nintendo.
2648780	2650260	So they're a master of messaging.
2650260	2652180	But yet again, they always flop online.
2652380	2653940	So here comes Discord.
2653940	2656940	Here comes Twitter to save their butt in that regard.
2656940	2659420	Well, and maybe make the problem worse in this case.
2659580	2661580	But everybody's going to share their codes on Discord.
2661580	2662460	Everybody's going to share.
2662460	2665300	Well, we will have to make a room on the VOG Network Discord.
2665300	2668380	I'm happy to do it on the VOG Network Discord over at VOG Network dot com
2668380	2669660	slash Discord. Cheap plug.
2669660	2671980	But join us. I'll have to make a room.
2671980	2676060	That's codes for the game center.
2676260	2677180	What the hell is this called?
2677180	2679140	Garage center games. God damn it.
2679140	2681500	What's it called? Garage games.
2681500	2685900	Yeah. Garage game build or garage or game builder garage.
2685900	2689300	Sorry. Garage garage garage.
2689300	2691780	God damn it. Something garage, something builder.
2691780	2696620	Yeah, that it's it's just it's it's avenue for people to draw
2697100	2700420	ballacies flying through the air and share that.
2700540	2702140	Well, how long until we'll do that?
2702140	2706020	How long until someone makes the penis game immediately and shares it?
2706300	2709700	I will see you in four weeks when we talk about the penis games
2709820	2712580	and Nintendo having to crack down on that for weeks.
2712580	2714940	You guys, that's that's about how much time we need.
2715580	2717660	That'll be about the release date. And
2718660	2719660	yeah.
2720420	2724380	See you in four weeks when we talk about how people abuse nice things
2724380	2725740	and why we can't have them.
2725740	2730300	Dark Sakura, you've been quiet, but I know you like your creative
2730300	2731540	outlets on Nintendo.
2731540	2733860	Hello, Animal Crossing.
2733860	2737620	Any interest in this garage game builder game?
2737660	2739820	Really? Yeah.
2739820	2742540	With this, I don't really enjoy Mario Maker either.
2742540	2746340	So I mean, I don't want to make my own game.
2747740	2752500	I just want to have a game that I can be creative within its universe.
2753300	2755020	Interesting. OK.
2755020	2758140	Yeah, this this this isn't really my kind of thing.
2758300	2762260	I like I like, you know, playing Sims
2762900	2766620	because it's in there with the set rules of that universe.
2767500	2769780	I don't want.
2769780	2773060	I don't want my game to be work.
2773060	2775660	OK, I just don't want to think like that.
2775660	2778700	I want to if I'm going to if I'm going to be creative
2778700	2783500	in a more abstract sense, it's going to be doing something
2784420	2787620	that I want to do for me.
2787620	2789260	That's why I like to make music.
2790260	2792940	That's why she recreate pixel poops in there.
2793980	2795620	But you should talk to Aaron about that.
2795620	2798260	Bobby Bockel from Chad says she doesn't want to make a game.
2798260	2800380	She wants other people to make her ideas.
2800380	2801700	Well, now that's a different topic.
2801700	2804180	That's completely different.
2804180	2808660	And I actually get your point, Jamie, because I don't play a game to work.
2809500	2815260	I I get the whole fact that like you can choose your tool to make art.
2815300	2818540	You can paint with oil, you can paint with watercolor,
2818540	2821700	you can paint with crayons, you know, whatever it is.
2821980	2826060	And so you like to paint in an Animal Crossing universe
2826060	2828420	where there are certain like boundaries and things like it,
2828420	2831620	not just Animal Crossing, but this example right where there's no.
2832460	2837460	Go how long I sit looking at logic before I actually get started on something.
2839260	2840900	Oh, I'm sure a long time I do the same.
2840900	2843060	Exactly. I don't want to do that with a video game.
2843500	2847780	Like if I go into the Sims, I know what's there in front of me.
2848780	2851540	And so I have the tools to work with, you know, it's like
2851940	2855300	if you are going to be constructing a house,
2855620	2857940	you know what tools you're going to be working with.
2857940	2860140	You've got those parameters.
2860140	2863780	I don't want to sit and have to rack my brain.
2864140	2867260	And on top of that, I just it doesn't interest me.
2867260	2869820	It really doesn't. I want to play a game.
2870420	2873020	I don't want to make the game.
2873020	2878180	I also like I get it because like I will I will probably buy this game,
2878540	2880780	but to play other people's games,
2880780	2885420	probably not to make anything of substance of my own, because I'm just not sure.
2886100	2887700	Maybe maybe the creative spark will bite.
2887700	2889100	You never know. Never say never.
2889100	2893540	But like but yet I just talked about Dragon Quest builders, too.
2893940	2897940	And I'm having fun building little houses, building little structures
2897940	2901060	and doing things a little bit outside of the lines of what the game is telling me
2901060	2903420	and kind of like doing my own thing in that universe.
2903620	2905300	I'm having a good time with it.
2905300	2908900	So I actually I actually relate to what you're saying, Jamie. I really do.
2909180	2911660	But I will probably still buy the game to play other people's games.
2912060	2912980	That's the difference.
2914420	2917220	So, yeah, but it would be it would be nice
2917220	2920980	if Nintendo would just put out a player, then, you know, best of both worlds.
2920980	2923060	Right. So. All right.
2923060	2925580	Anyway, but that is that is a pleasant surprise out of Nintendo.
2925580	2928900	And again, only like five weeks away. That's very surprising. Yeah.
2928900	2930980	And that's also like June 11th.
2930980	2934060	That's probably right smack dab
2934060	2937660	in the center of when E3 quote quote stuff is going on.
2938860	2941980	Yeah. Yeah, it would be.
2942300	2944780	So that's also an interesting timing for that.
2944980	2948460	And I bet Nintendo is probably going to dedicate a few treehouse hours
2948460	2951100	to that game, even though it will be coming out at that time.
2951300	2952540	They've done this before.
2952540	2955700	There was another game that came out like the week of E3,
2955820	2956980	and they were still showing it.
2956980	2959460	And I don't remember in the moment arms.
2959460	2961340	I think you're right. It was arms.
2961340	2964020	I think it was arms. So anyway.
2965380	2967740	Bobby Blackwell says the 11th is a Friday.
2967740	2969940	Isn't the E3 stuff the next week?
2970540	2973420	I might be wrong, but I think the E3 stuff is the next week.
2973420	2975660	Like it's like the 13th, 14th, something like that.
2976460	2978580	Of course, the 13th will be a Sunday.
2978580	2981740	So I could be wrong, but it is the.
2982020	2983660	Yeah, it starts Saturday.
2983660	2986140	So it's the day after is when E3 starts.
2986140	2987460	Oh, that's right.
2987460	2991260	It's not the usual timetable this year anyway, because it's virtual.
2992580	2995020	Oh, no, no, no change every year.
2995060	2997780	Well, they've also sometimes the press conferences
2997780	3000180	have started that far in advance as well.
3000620	3003260	I remember that. But anyway.
3003380	3005980	I just think it's interesting that it's so close to all of that.
3005980	3009700	So just want you to know that the game awards were actually part of E3.
3009700	3012500	It's just they started like six months in advance of E3.
3012940	3015540	It's fine. No, no. Game awards are summer game fest.
3015580	3016220	There's a difference.
3016220	3018220	Loki can't camp.
3018220	3019900	Keeley has his own thing.
3019900	3021940	It's all part of the E3.
3021940	3024860	That just takes place several months after E3. It's fine.
3025500	3027820	All right. Let's talk about.
3027820	3033940	OK, maybe maybe game garage builder camp thing is not up Dark Soccer's alley.
3034140	3035820	But I know this one is.
3035820	3037420	And it's releasing this Friday.
3037420	3041260	It's the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is coming out this Friday.
3041820	3044940	Dark Soccer, you have your all yours preordered and ready to go.
3045420	3047500	No, no. Are you not?
3047500	3049660	Because I said I'm going to get it.
3050020	3053380	But I need to get my Windows virtual virtualization set up,
3053380	3055940	which means I'm probably going to have to dish out the funds for
3056820	3059620	for parallels
3059620	3064620	because they've got a Windows arm for free that works now on the M1 Mac Mini.
3065260	3069420	And all of my other games I've been playing have looked terrific.
3069420	3075500	So I'm going to have to make sure that it's going to work for me playing it.
3076100	3078340	And I don't want to get it through Stadia is the issue.
3078540	3082460	I mean, and I do eventually want to get my Dead by Daylight stuff linked for
3083460	3086500	on Steam as well so that I can just pick up where I left off.
3086820	3088060	Yeah, that'll be that'll be nice.
3088060	3090900	You'll get that benefit where I didn't coming from Xbox one.
3090900	3092460	But that'll be nice.
3092460	3095700	But anyway, well, I actually haven't preordered mine
3095700	3097820	because I know I'm just going to walk into Target and get it.
3097820	3098900	That's kind of what I do now.
3098900	3101020	Like, I don't I don't trust games to deliver on time.
3101260	3103700	I just I just go into Target and get them.
3103700	3106980	But I I'm definitely going to pick up the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
3106980	3111180	I'll probably get it on Xbox one just because that's excuse me, Xbox Series X,
3111220	3113420	because that's my most advanced console I have right now.
3113980	3116620	And I played the original on Xbox 360 first.
3116620	3119260	So it's kind of like it was kind of my home base for Mass Effect.
3119540	3123300	And yes, this means I will be buying Mass Effect three for the fifth time.
3123860	3127460	Shut up. But let's talk about the original Mass Effect,
3127460	3129460	because that's where the most exciting changes are coming,
3129460	3132460	is that they're really kind of given an overhaul to the first Mass Effect game
3132660	3134660	to kind of catch it up to where two and three were.
3134660	3138500	And of course, one of those quality of life changes is the Mako
3138500	3142060	and driving that that's the car in Mass Effect.
3142060	3144420	And it wasn't a lot of fun to drive.
3144420	3148500	I don't remember hating it, but I remember thinking like this thing is a pain in the ass
3149860	3151100	and they've they've fixed it.
3151100	3154340	However, if you are a purist and you insist
3154700	3157900	on driving the Mako the original way, good news.
3157900	3161260	In an interview with PC Gamer, Kevin Meek from BioWare said,
3161420	3165940	we've left the option to leave it back kind of closer to the original controls
3165940	3170020	as well, if you want for those people out there who do like pain.
3171300	3175140	Suffering. I love that he said that about his own game.
3176860	3178060	But that you know what?
3178060	3180780	You know what? There's always going to be that there's always that person
3180780	3184580	on social media that's going to be like, I like the old way better.
3184940	3190780	It was better the way it was before, even though everybody else dunked on it.
3190980	3193740	There's going to be somebody that's going to say the old way was better.
3193820	3195540	Well, guess what?
3195540	3198260	Person, the ooh, she's different person on Twitter.
3198260	3201700	Guess what? You get to have it both ways if you want.
3201900	3204100	So that's the big news this week.
3204100	3207140	Yeah. And I'm excited to play the legendary edition in a few days.
3207140	3209340	That'll probably make up a chunk of my gaming week next week.
3209340	3212620	I'm still a little sad there's no multiplayer, but I get it.
3212700	3215100	I understand why that's not an option.
3215100	3219660	All right. Phoenix 7726 says the galactic readiness
3219660	3222420	in three will be significantly changed as well.
3223260	3226620	Yeah, excuse me. Yeah, they're going to have to because there is no multiplayer.
3227380	3230340	And I don't think the phone app is going to be a thing anymore.
3231300	3234060	Excuse me. So I think they already said it's going to be much more based
3234060	3237460	on like the things you did and didn't do earlier on in the trilogy
3237780	3240380	and in the game three.
3241300	3245380	Act Efton Chat says, Wait, Rob, you're not getting a copy for each console?
3246060	3250020	No, you have to remember the reason why did I really buy Mass Effect
3250020	3251660	three so many times?
3251660	3253020	The multiplayer.
3253020	3254820	There was no cross play back then.
3254820	3257540	And I had people I wanted to play PlayStation on.
3257780	3259700	I had people I wanted to play PC on.
3259700	3261300	I had people I want to play Xbox on.
3261300	3263580	So that was kind of the reason.
3263580	3268060	Also, it really helps that Wii U version was on sale like dirt cheap.
3268060	3269020	That's when I picked that up.
3269020	3271700	And I think the PlayStation trilogy was on sale when I bought it, too.
3271940	3274900	So because there's no multiplayer,
3275220	3279020	I really don't see the need to get this on any other console.
3279020	3281820	And I don't think I will.
3281820	3284460	Never say never, I guess.
3284460	3285460	Let's see.
3287620	3289420	What was the other
3289420	3291420	comment here? Oh, SD100Matt said,
3291900	3294300	Will we see you stream any of it, Rob?
3294780	3297300	I hadn't considered it because I didn't think people wanted to see it.
3297300	3300060	But since you asked so nicely.
3300060	3303300	Sure, I probably yeah, I can do a stream Friday night after work
3303940	3306100	and do several hours of the first Mass Effect game
3306340	3307860	and look at some of the changes.
3307860	3311620	Streaming narrative games and RPGs is a little weird for me.
3311620	3313780	I know other people do it. I know Dark Sakura is doing it.
3314140	3315620	But for me, it's a little weird
3315620	3318540	because I always feel like when you kind of pick up something in the middle,
3318540	3320380	it's a lot harder to follow.
3320380	3324340	But I like to do those first night games.
3324900	3327380	And so, yeah.
3327380	3330460	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says if it goes to play, I might think about it.
3330460	3334540	It probably will eventually, but that could be a couple of years out.
3335100	3337740	Keep in mind, the original trilogy is already on play.
3337860	3339980	And I think it's interesting they didn't remove it or anything.
3339980	3344340	So if you want to play the originals, is Mass Effect three on it?
3345100	3347180	I don't recall. I know one and two are.
3348980	3350300	But interesting.
3350700	3350940	Dr.
3350940	3354940	Tzuyu says, I hear there might be new DMCA concerns with the Mass Effect remaster.
3355100	3358020	Saw something on Twitter that the music's in the library now.
3358420	3360220	Well, they have until Friday to fix it.
3360220	3362980	They did have a couple of licensed songs in the game, too.
3363220	3365580	So that could also be messing with it a little bit.
3365620	3369900	So, you know, play with the volume low in certain parts, especially the credits.
3370700	3375100	Phoenix 7726 says, I wonder why they stripped out the multiplayer from three.
3375660	3376660	They've commented on it.
3376660	3379420	And it's basically that
3379420	3382900	it wasn't the point of the remaster and it would have been extra resources
3382900	3384900	to do all that.
3384900	3387220	And so they they kind of left it.
3387700	3392540	I would I wish they would do, you know, especially because the Mass Effect
3392940	3395500	whatever project they're working on now that was announced
3395500	3398060	at the Game Awards a couple of years ago, that project,
3398060	3400860	we're not going to see until like 2024, probably.
3400860	3402300	Let's be real. It's going to be a lot.
3402300	3404380	We still don't have the fucking new Dragon Age game.
3404540	3406260	And how long have they been talking about that?
3406260	3410180	So that Mass Effect game, it ain't happening for a long time.
3410660	3414980	It would be very nice if as a bridge in between, there was a multiple.
3414980	3418100	And I've been seeing this for a goddamn long time.
3418900	3421220	If they just had a multiplayer only game,
3421460	3425660	a Mass Effect multiplayer only game in the universe, a 40 dollar game or something.
3425900	3429020	Hell, do 20 dollars and charge for boxes or whatever.
3429020	3431660	I still miss that. Like fucking people will play it.
3431900	3434100	Dark Sakura will play it, like, you know,
3435260	3438180	and she doesn't play a lot of multiplayer games that I can think of.
3438500	3441300	So do it anyway.
3442820	3446940	Phoenix 7726 says the question about that project is after the train wreck
3446940	3449380	that was Andromeda, does anyone believe it could work?
3450220	3452500	I feel like Andromeda's.
3452500	3454500	Yes, is the short answer.
3454500	3458380	I feel like Andromeda has also gained a lot of favor with people
3458380	3459860	the longer it's been around.
3459860	3462260	I think you're seeing more and more people kind of come up and say,
3462580	3464660	you know, Andromeda was done dirty.
3465260	3468380	And that's exactly the point I've been saying since day one.
3468380	3470340	Andromeda was done dirty.
3470340	3473020	That game wasn't fucking finished when they released it.
3473340	3476380	Now that it's finished, it's actually not bad.
3477020	3479420	Yeah, it's a little different because it's in another universe.
3479580	3480820	It's it's weird to get it.
3480820	3485140	But if you really look at it as what it is at this point, a side story,
3485140	3489900	a side adventure, a Star Wars, Rogue One, if you will, it's fine.
3491060	3492580	I want to play through that again, too.
3492580	3494340	So anyway. All right.
3494340	3497580	Enough Mass Effect chat because we could go on for three hours just about that.
3497860	3501540	Let's talk about a chatting program, Dark Sakura.
3501580	3502540	I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.
3502540	3503220	Dark Sakura is next.
3503220	3509180	Sorry. Well, and I think that maybe a lot of people have even noticed this already.
3509540	3514060	But Discord, which I mean, we use for how we communicate
3514060	3515220	with each other for the show.
3515220	3516740	So hi, we're an example.
3516740	3519260	We're literally on it right now. Yes. Yeah.
3520260	3522980	It's been really moving.
3523820	3527020	Well, I wouldn't say past gaming communities,
3527300	3531380	but it's expanding out into other other genre.
3531540	3535300	There's non gaming specific servers like to focus on TV.
3535300	3539500	I'm in one for Supernatural and there's role play groups and there's
3541860	3548180	discussions and things for fantasy fucking football and dating even.
3549460	3554460	There's groups for fans of TV shows to get together and watch it in Discord
3554900	3558980	so they can watch throughout the the pandemic while they're quarantined.
3559420	3562780	I know. I know people that pirate drag race that way.
3562780	3567140	Basically, they have their view parties for drag race that they don't,
3567380	3570540	you know, like an East Coast friend streams it so the West Coast
3570540	3572540	friends can watch it. I'm not saying I've ever done it.
3572540	3574900	I just know that that's the thing.
3574900	3578260	Well, and one of the things that makes Discord special is that
3578700	3583260	they're not funded from ads, they don't make any money from ads.
3583580	3587340	They make their money through Nitro, which is a service
3587660	3591420	that's either $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year.
3591900	3595900	That gives some extra features like a high res video,
3595900	3598500	animated emoji, a few other things.
3598500	3601340	But I mean, but right now
3601340	3606220	they have more than 140 million monthly active viewers.
3606620	3612260	And I mean, but in 2019, it was at 56 million.
3612260	3615900	So it is already practically tripled. Yeah.
3617940	3620900	19 million weekly active servers.
3621660	3624260	So, I mean, it's pretty, pretty crazy.
3624740	3629140	So but now I mean, like some professors
3629140	3632020	are using it to to teach their classes.
3633020	3636580	And then, of course, Microsoft was interested
3636580	3640740	in buying a Discord for about 10 million.
3640740	3643060	This was in March. Yep.
3643060	3646260	But instead, now they have a partnership with Sony,
3646500	3648380	which we'll get into next.
3648380	3651580	Yeah. But the thing, it's customizable.
3651580	3655740	A lot of people find it as an attractive alternative to using Slack.
3656060	3658700	And Slack, don't get me wrong, Slack is great
3660020	3663300	for businesses and nonprofits.
3663340	3667380	I think that there's a lot more freedom for an open chat
3667380	3671660	forum using Discord than using Slack.
3672660	3675500	Yeah, we still use Slack for Ingress stuff, too.
3675500	3679460	Like when we had Slack at work, we had the big event in Ingress
3679460	3683060	in here in October, and we used Slack heavily for that,
3683060	3684340	for the planning and all that stuff.
3684340	3686900	I'm sorry, October before the pandemic, October 2019.
3687180	3692060	And yeah, I do like the threading that Slack has better over Discord.
3693060	3695100	But there.
3695980	3697940	I think Discord is better for a broader audience.
3697940	3698660	Does that make sense?
3699540	3703260	The biggest thing that Slack really has is those integrations,
3703540	3706900	and you can integrate to a level. Discord has bots,
3707260	3710860	but you can integrate Slack to a little bit of a stronger degree
3710860	3712380	than you can Discord, if that makes sense.
3712380	3714780	At least my perception is, based on the stuff I've seen,
3714980	3716980	is that bots are cool, but they're bots.
3716980	3720380	The integrations you do on Discord, or excuse me, on Slack
3720780	3722260	go a little bit further.
3722260	3726380	So well, the thing, the really big thing to
3727220	3728580	to get from this, though,
3728580	3732740	is that with that exponential growth as it is,
3732980	3737420	I mean, and this is in about a year and a half, about.
3740900	3744060	We're seeing all these other forums pop up on here,
3744060	3746020	and of course, Discord ain't mad about it.
3746020	3750700	But I think that it's almost like how we were seeing things happen
3750700	3752660	with YouTube, right?
3752660	3755740	Where it was just, oh, these people's videos.
3755740	3760100	Now we have like entire shows and music video releases and this and that.
3760700	3764700	We're definitely seeing Discord become
3764700	3767220	I mean, I think at its core, it's still the gamers, right?
3767220	3771220	Yeah. Yeah. But but I think that there's room for everybody
3771220	3773740	in that play box, in that sandbox. Absolutely.
3774300	3779180	Bob Coffey in our chat says all Discord is, is IRC with embedded cat pictures.
3779460	3782500	Respectfully, no. Much better.
3782740	3786860	Yeah, I get it, because what you described is kind of slack.
3787660	3793460	Here's the thing that Discord has that slack doesn't and and an IRC doesn't.
3794180	3796260	Look, we're doing it right now.
3797820	3800740	This show, video chat, able to do this whole thing,
3800940	3803220	and if we wanted to, I could probably bring I mean,
3803220	3805140	I have to have the layouts for it and everything, but I could.
3805140	3807780	Well, I've done it before when I brought like Delvin or Shane or somebody
3807780	3811020	on here as a fourth chair and Jamie and I have been talking offline
3811020	3813900	about having some more fourth chairs in the future from the community and so forth.
3814140	3817580	So we might, you know, we can do that all through Discord.
3817580	3820980	And that, you know, especially now in the pandemic era,
3821260	3823780	that's something that IRC really couldn't bring us.
3823940	3827060	IRC still had bots and all that cool stuff.
3827140	3830060	Whoever played Acrophobia and that stuff on IRC, right?
3830220	3831740	So you still had some of that stuff.
3831740	3835700	But the big, big difference, and I think really why Discord is going
3835700	3838420	to the moon right now, especially in the pandemic,
3839220	3841380	this pandemic has been a terrible thing.
3841460	3844980	But let's be real, some companies have made a lot of fucking money off of it.
3845420	3847260	And I'm not just talking about pharmacies.
3847460	3850540	I'm talking about Zoom.
3851180	3853460	Big one, right? The number one probably.
3853460	3857220	And this Discord has done very well because of the pandemic.
3857940	3863260	But isn't it kind of cool that like people that you never thought
3863260	3866500	would use video chat software are kind of able to use it now?
3866780	3871980	Like it's a very, if I can tell my, I can tell my 82 year old dad
3871980	3873740	to do a Zoom call and he knows how to do it.
3874220	3877340	Yeah. That's it's become a necessity.
3877460	3881300	Yeah. And this is what our culture is now.
3882340	3885180	Now in chat, they're kind of having a side conversation here.
3885460	3889340	Phoenix 7726 asked, how does Microsoft solution compare?
3889460	3891380	And DJ Rama said it was Teams.
3891580	3893620	Bobby says it's Microsoft Teams.
3894220	3896100	And to be fair, I can't evaluate it.
3896100	3896940	I've never used it.
3898060	3899220	I use it at work.
3899260	3900500	It's all right. It's all right.
3900540	3902980	It's kind of, it's kind of very similar to Slack, isn't it?
3904020	3909580	It's not even really, it's more of like, um, I think of like an instant
3909580	3913740	messenger more and you can share, like, it feels like an instant messenger to
3913740	3915260	me and you can share like stuff.
3915260	3919340	You can have chats, you can call people through it and do meetings,
3919340	3922820	but it's, it's not, it doesn't feel like Discord at all.
3923020	3923420	Yeah.
3923980	3925500	I mean, it's sort of set up, I guess.
3925500	3928940	It's just a guest appearance, but yeah, you can set up different groups and
3928940	3931500	stuff like that and have discussions.
3931500	3933300	I don't know if you can do groups within groups.
3933340	3934420	Maybe you can, I don't know.
3934420	3935140	But, um,
3935460	3940620	Isn't Teams like a kind of almost like a step ahead from Skype because at my,
3941340	3943780	okay, so at my business, we use Skype for business.
3944340	3947380	Um, so we're still on that, like to chat and, and do the stuff we
3947380	3948340	need desktop share and stuff.
3948580	3953340	But, um, uh, I keep seeing things about getting upgraded to Teams.
3953340	3955300	So I think that might be coming in the future because I think
3955300	3956900	that's the next progression, but we'll see.
3957180	3957420	We'll see.
3957420	3958420	Yeah, probably.
3958900	3959140	Yeah.
3959660	3959980	All right.
3959980	3960340	Anyhow.
3960340	3963660	Um, so dark soccer referenced something there that I know you
3963660	3964820	were going to elaborate on Loki.
3965380	3965700	Yeah.
3965740	3970580	So, um, Discord now is going to be integrated a little bit with, uh,
3970620	3971500	PlayStation.
3971500	3975780	So this is coming from the fact that Sony has actually invested a
3975780	3978900	minority stake in Discord itself.
3979220	3983060	And the company's plan to bring Discord and PlayStation experiences closer
3983060	3987780	together on console and mobile starting early next year, and apparently
3987780	3991540	they're working hard on connecting Discord with, uh, the social and gaming
3991540	3992860	experiences of PlayStation network.
3993100	3996300	I'm guessing maybe that'll show like which games you're playing.
3996300	4001740	Maybe some sort of cross talk between, um, I don't know, like
4001740	4003300	the mate chat rooms and stuff.
4003300	4005540	It'd be nice to see it for them integrate that.
4005540	4007780	Cause aren't they getting rid of like the party chat and stuff like
4007780	4009260	that, or they're doing something with it.
4009380	4010820	Well, they got rid of communities already.
4011340	4011900	Communities.
4012140	4013820	So maybe this is replacing communities.
4013940	4017500	Um, be interesting to see if that's, that's what they're doing with it.
4017940	4021460	Um, but yeah, I mean, I don't know.
4021460	4022460	It sounds cool.
4024020	4025300	I can't wait to see what they do with it.
4025500	4030700	I think it's important to remember that Microsoft also has kind of a partnership
4030700	4035500	with Discord, um, and that is that if you like link your Xbox account with your
4035500	4040620	Discord account, that, um, I think there's some benefits that crossover, don't quote
4040620	4041140	me on that.
4041500	4046540	Um, but, uh, namely also, and this is the big one is that if I'm playing a game on
4046540	4051100	Xbox, you see it on discord, you know how like on discord, you can see so-and-so is
4051140	4054580	currently streaming or it says so-and-so is playing dead by daylight, which mine
4054580	4059020	probably says a lot, but if I'm on Xbox, I imagine it also will say is playing
4059020	4060140	Dragon Quest builders too.
4060140	4060780	Like it does that.
4060980	4064380	And so when I first read this story that I was kind of like, I think people are
4064380	4067220	going crazy with, it sounds like PlayStation is just doing the same thing.
4067500	4069700	And they're, they're integrating discord in that regard.
4070020	4073780	Um, but it actually sounds like maybe PlayStation is planning to go a step
4073780	4077420	further with this, that like, now we really see, oh, this is why they got rid
4077420	4079340	of communities real fast.
4079780	4082540	You know, they didn't give a lot of warning on the communities going away.
4082780	4087060	It, maybe there really is going to be some integration within the console itself.
4087060	4089100	It would be exciting to see what they do.
4089100	4092820	If they actually would just talk about it, you know, then we can figure it out and be
4092820	4095500	excited about it, but nope, let's keep it a secret forever.
4096620	4098260	Yeah, be interesting.
4098260	4100020	So maybe we'll find out more about this.
4100060	4104060	This could be the type of thing that Sony unveils in an E3 timeframe.
4104060	4108820	I know I say that a lot, but you know, it's, it's not far away.
4108820	4112900	And especially if Sony has sunsetted communities as fast as they've done, I
4112900	4114540	think they're already planning something.
4114860	4116220	So we'll see.
4117580	4119740	Um, well, maybe, maybe, okay.
4119740	4123660	Maybe not so fast because some folks in chat, I guess, saw something I missed
4123900	4128060	as Joe and her mat says, we apparently won't see anything with it until 2022.
4128540	4132500	Probably because the PlayStation firmware takes that long to update, honestly.
4132940	4136860	Uh, and act-def says, there's gotta be some PlayStations to put it on, you know, so,
4137140	4141140	uh, act-def says the thing is that considering this isn't coming anytime
4141140	4143260	soon, it seems that there is more.
4143460	4148500	So maybe we'll see kind of maybe we'll see like as a small first step.
4148820	4152780	That whole, you know, what you plan kind of connection that Xbox has.
4152820	4157100	And then maybe there will be more to it in, in 2022, like some actual
4157100	4158700	integration within the console itself.
4158700	4163300	That'd be very interesting and very good news for Discord, who did not, is,
4163300	4166980	is venturing it alone and plans to be its own company and probably
4166980	4168420	its own IPO at some point.
4168700	4170580	Way down the line, way down the line.
4171620	4172060	All right.
4174420	4175020	Excuse me.
4176140	4180140	Let's talk about this next story, which has to do with summer games done quick.
4180540	4182900	I can't believe we're already at the point we're talking
4182900	4184340	about summer games done quick.
4184980	4189100	This year has, like, weren't we just done with awesome games done quick?
4189100	4193180	Like this year is just like flown by, but, uh, a lot of people, of
4193180	4194860	course, look forward to these weeks.
4194860	4197060	Not only are they a great charity event, but they're just a
4197060	4198300	lot of fun to watch, right?
4198580	4202300	Uh, speed running is, uh, it's, it's almost a sport of a sport within
4202340	4203700	of the video game community.
4203980	4208300	Uh, and people can watch it, uh, a lot, just like they consume something like ESPN.
4208780	4212860	So, uh, summer games done quick 2021 has, uh, basically released
4212860	4216820	all the games that will be played during summer games done quick.
4217020	4220580	Now, the difference here, this is not the, what is being played
4220580	4222300	when list that comes later.
4222500	4224900	This is just the list of basically like what's been accepted.
4224940	4226100	So it's alphabetical.
4226300	4229940	Um, there's still a lot of stuff to be determined about summer games done quick.
4230180	4233700	Uh, for example, I believe our pal Bobby Black Wolf doesn't yet
4233700	4235340	know about the hosting thing.
4235620	4237460	Uh, I think there's still a little time on that.
4237820	4240340	Uh, and, uh, some of the other things they have to figure out.
4240820	4244340	Um, and yes, uh, is pointed out that summer games done quick is still going
4244340	4248700	to be virtual and that they announced that sometime ago, I think though, they
4248700	4253900	still have a skeleton crew at, at the home base hotel, um, that's kind
4253900	4255460	of like the master control switch.
4255700	4259500	And honestly, now that, you know, vaccines are a thing, you got a lot more
4259500	4261220	States that are opening up in mid June.
4261380	4265340	I don't think that whole notion is as dangerous as it once was, but there is
4265340	4271860	probably still some hesitancy about, can we get 500 people in a room to watch this?
4271900	4274700	That that's the part where I think there's still a lot of hesitancy there.
4274780	4276820	So, um, yeah, yeah.
4278060	4281460	Uh, anyhow, uh, yeah, Bobby says they always have a skeleton crew
4281460	4283300	that runs the stream in Virginia.
4283300	4285300	I remember that cause you talked about it on previous show.
4285580	4286900	Anyway, the list is out.
4286940	4289860	It's way too long for me to read everything on it, but some
4289860	4291020	things that caught my eye.
4291300	4292620	I love me some Bayonetta.
4292940	4296260	Uh, the Batman video games on NES and Genesis.
4296260	4298980	I thought it was cute that they kind of have both of those going on there.
4299180	4304780	Uh, cave story, 3d, uh, not too, uh, a recent ish, uh, game classic game of the
4304780	4307060	week, uh, you know, we love our Bemani.
4307180	4309700	Uh, that's where our roots are here at orange lounge radio.
4309900	4311940	Uh, and they've got dance rush stardom.
4311980	4314180	That's that's the new one with the fancy floor.
4315020	4315860	That's the new one.
4315860	4316340	I see that.
4316380	4316740	Yeah.
4316740	4320380	That's the new one with the floor that, um, I I'm not coordinated enough to play.
4320380	4321220	I've tried playing it.
4321220	4324260	And the reality is when the show started, I was in my twenties
4324260	4325300	and now I'm in my forties.
4325780	4327300	So a little different.
4327460	4331100	They're doing a dance show, disposable income someday.
4331100	4334060	You know, I'll have to get one of those.
4334100	4334420	Yeah.
4334700	4338820	Well, anyway, you get to see an hour and a half of a dance showcase, uh, played
4338820	4340980	by Iji Ken, if I said that name, right.
4340980	4342100	I'm sorry if I mispronounced the name.
4342100	4343260	They're going to be amazing.
4343740	4347140	Um, it looks like they're doing a destiny to raid of sorts.
4347140	4348060	So I think that's kind of neat.
4348100	4349700	F zero G X.
4349900	4350660	Hell yeah.
4350740	4354340	One of my all time favorites, uh, underrated, uh, in the more
4354340	4356420	recent department horizon, zero dawn.
4356460	4359020	Uh, well, I guess that game's a few years old at this point, but still it's
4359020	4361300	kinda, uh, dark Tetsuya, where you at?
4361300	4363140	Cause they're doing the La Mulana remake.
4363580	4365220	I know that's one of your faves out there.
4365460	4369900	Uh, and for dark soccer, they're doing mass effect to, uh, speed run, and it's
4369900	4372420	going to be done in an hour and 31 minutes.
4373220	4375900	My God, that's going to be something else.
4376060	4377300	Lots of mega man games.
4377300	4380020	I don't know how I feel about speed runs of mass effect.
4380020	4380780	Maybe I'll watch it.
4380940	4383260	It's it's, it's a novelty.
4383340	4386660	Let's just put it that, um, Pokemon games.
4386660	4389140	Of course, there's going to be a black and white race.
4389460	4393980	So that's going to be a, for that jet gen five, that would be so the gen five race.
4394220	4396540	Uh, and then somebody is running Pokemon emerald.
4396620	4398420	Uh, that'll be kind of fun to watch.
4398660	4400260	Resident evil seven.
4400740	4402740	Is getting speed runs, not eight yet.
4402900	4405780	Eight's a little too new, but seven came out yet.
4405820	4406220	Yeah.
4407180	4412580	Uh, watch them words, Loki, you know, they're already working on it.
4412580	4413500	Watch them words.
4413540	4415620	It's it's absolutely being worked on already.
4415820	4418340	And of course the old favorites, super Metroid is back.
4418620	4422180	Uh, and there's a, you know, some Mario and, uh, I was trying to see
4422180	4423300	if anything else jumped out at me.
4423460	4426260	Oh, for me, Zoda's revenge star tropics too.
4426420	4429820	We don't talk about the star tropics series on NES enough, quite honestly.
4430060	4432940	Um, because people don't even remember there was a second game.
4432940	4433540	So it's kind of cool.
4433540	4434900	That was totally a classic game.
4435500	4438460	It maybe I haven't done Zoda's revenge, but I brought it up when it did.
4438460	4439340	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4439340	4440140	You did the first one.
4440140	4443180	You didn't do the second one yet, but the second one is interesting because,
4443500	4447420	um, it was, uh, one of the, it was the next to last game on the NES.
4448020	4451780	I believe warriors woods was last, but star tropics two is next to last.
4452220	4453740	So it's interesting for that reason.
4454300	4459020	Um, Bobby Blackwell says resident evil eight will be at awesome games done quick.
4459060	4460660	Oh, Bobby pointing out something I missed.
4460660	4462580	There are no final fantasy games.
4463300	4463940	That's interesting.
4465140	4467100	Well, I guess let's take a long time.
4467260	4469620	They know it and they always do them.
4469860	4472020	And that's, I think it's okay to put something on the back
4472020	4472900	burner for a little bit.
4473060	4475220	You know, jazz punk will be fun.
4475220	4476060	I like that game.
4476140	4476420	Yeah.
4476420	4478700	Um, uh, what else do they have?
4478700	4480220	That looks pretty awesome in here.
4480300	4484220	Uh, I don't know.
4484220	4484540	Jeez.
4484540	4487060	There's like so many mega mans questbusters.
4487220	4488540	So they must be having a race for that.
4488620	4491860	So following up your resident evil eight comment quest buster is commenting in
4491860	4494540	chat, uh, Bowser's fury already made the list.
4494620	4496740	And that hasn't been out that long, all things considered.
4496740	4498260	So it's February though.
4498260	4500140	I mean, that's, I mean, that's still, yeah.
4500140	4500300	Yeah.
4503300	4503740	All right.
4504020	4506860	Anyway, so go check out the list, uh, at games done quick.com.
4506900	4507980	Uh, check that out.
4507980	4511260	And, uh, I'm sure everybody will be watching the event later on this summer.
4511500	4512420	So, all right.
4512500	4516820	Uh, let's move on a dark Sakura with some more, uh, studio acquisition news.
4517540	4518300	Indeed.
4518380	4521580	And this, it has a little bit of significance on this one.
4521620	4527980	So EA has bought, uh, a, uh, video game developer, uh, metal, metalhead
4527980	4528580	software.
4529060	4535620	There's a creator of a game called super mega baseball and EA, of course, you know,
4535620	4539380	since they bought them, that means that they've got a new baseball franchise
4539420	4540420	under their belt now.
4540980	4547460	And so, um, cause I mean, it's been over, over 10 years since their last, uh,
4547500	4548420	baseball SIM.
4548660	4551660	That was MVP 07 NCAA baseball.
4552340	4559340	So it looks like that this metalhead developed game, uh, is going to be
4559380	4560620	coming out as an EA title.
4560980	4568500	Um, they are in, uh, uh, Victoria and their office is still going to be open
4568500	4569300	and functional.
4569820	4576660	Um, but metalhead it's IPs are going to be owned by EA.
4577100	4577820	So there you go.
4578900	4579420	All right.
4579460	4580980	EA is grabbing them up.
4581820	4585500	So this means that they're looking back in the baseball genre.
4585500	4586860	So it'd be interesting.
4587300	4587620	All right.
4588020	4589300	Uh, let's move on Loki.
4590500	4590820	Yeah.
4590820	4595940	So there's a, we talked about this once every few weeks or so about the new,
4595980	4600500	um, enhancements being done to some of these older games on Xbox with the FPS
4600500	4603940	boosting, where they're like doubling the FPS on certain games and whatnot.
4604180	4605100	I was trying to get the full list.
4605100	4609580	They added another 70 games, um, to it now.
4609820	4611100	So it's ridiculous.
4611140	4615780	Um, Right now, some of them wants to note, you know, they have Assassin's
4615780	4620820	Creed, the Ezio collection, dying light, far cry, new Dawn, Lego worlds.
4620860	4623220	Um, those are all now at 60 FPS.
4623700	4626540	Uh, Metro last light at 120 FPS.
4626580	4627940	Um, Metro is a great game.
4627980	4628580	Seriously.
4628700	4633220	It is important to know some of these you have to enable, like it's not just because
4633220	4636220	I believe sometimes the frame boost effects quality.
4636460	4639300	So for that reason, you have to enable it if you want it.
4639340	4642100	So, um, there's a lot of guides out there from Microsoft on how to
4642100	4643860	do this within your Xbox console.
4644020	4644940	So something you should be aware of.
4645060	4648900	I believe if the game supports this, it has an icon that says so at this point.
4648940	4649420	Yes.
4649620	4656060	And the, the most important game, getting a 120 FPS mode, untitled goose game,
4656460	4660020	because I need that game to run at 120 FPS.
4660620	4665980	Think of how fast I can honk now in that game with 120 FPS, you know, let's honk
4665980	4669740	on every single frame and, uh, and we'll do that.
4670620	4674820	So, uh, yeah, lots and lots of games that are backwards compatible,
4674860	4677020	uh, with that, the FPS boosts.
4677060	4681900	I mean, we can't go over all of them, but there there's a lot.
4681900	4686140	So, um, I was trying to see if there's any other notable ones on here.
4686900	4691500	I can't tell what was already on that list that they added now, but it's a lot.
4691500	4693180	There's a full list on xbox.com.
4693180	4696380	If you're curious, I'm also sure it's probably listed in games pass.
4696420	4699020	You know, what's on there, but look for the icons.
4700220	4703660	I mean, there's a ton of games and they're only, they're going to keep adding to it.
4703660	4706660	So this is kind of what they're doing instead of backwards compatibility now.
4706660	4709380	Well, I shouldn't say instead they claim they're still working on
4709380	4713980	backwards compatibility, but I, I what's left besides the DDR games.
4714340	4717700	I can't, I can't think of anything, but I'm sure there's some, but, uh, yeah.
4718180	4718500	All right.
4718500	4720180	Have they beaten groovy yet?
4720500	4721220	Yes.
4723540	4724700	You weren't expecting that answer.
4724700	4725060	Were you?
4725380	4728060	But yes, that is compatible.
4728300	4731860	I don't think that one is, uh, neither is, uh, the rock band.
4731860	4736580	Uh, I rock band blitz, but that's probably a music licensing thing.
4736580	4737380	I'm going to play there.
4737700	4738140	Who knows?
4738780	4742060	Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says we need a DJ hero remake.
4742060	4742580	Honestly.
4742580	4743180	Yes.
4743580	4747180	Oh God, I would be there day one immediately.
4747340	4747860	Yeah.
4747900	4751500	Um, but absolutely by that, I don't know if it's going to happen.
4751500	4756420	Cause that guitar hero reboot, as good as it was, didn't do unfortunate news.
4756420	4759540	As we talked about last week, there can't be a DJ hero game.
4759540	4762820	Cause all of the games now are being, are all the game companies now at
4762860	4765180	Activision are working on call of duty.
4765180	4767100	So it's all called duty from now on.
4767140	4768380	That's all that they're putting out.
4769140	4769700	Womp womp.
4770460	4770980	All right.
4770980	4774340	Well, blizzard's putting some stuff out and, uh, of course the classics
4774340	4776380	that they're putting out are, uh, you know, there's a, there's a lot of,
4776380	4778660	they've been kind of dipping into the vault while they've been working on
4778660	4782340	some new games, uh, we know Diablo two remastered is coming later this year,
4782540	4786660	but coming a lot sooner on June 1st, the launch of world of Warcraft
4786660	4788620	classic, the burning crusade.
4788900	4792820	Um, so this is something that was teased several months ago, uh, that
4792820	4793900	blizzard's going to be doing this.
4793900	4796940	I think they've done some testing on it as well, but, uh, the burning
4796940	4798980	crusade will be launching on June 1st.
4799020	4802220	Uh, this is kind of a big deal for me because this was the expansion
4802220	4803540	that really got me into wow.
4803860	4806860	I did play in vanilla, but I didn't play a lot in vanilla.
4806860	4808780	I subscribed for maybe like two months in vanilla.
4809180	4812140	I started doing the rating and shit in the burning crusade.
4812180	4813620	That's when I really got into wow.
4813620	4815420	So I think this is really interesting.
4815460	4821460	I'm, I'm not sure I have the drive to pay the monthly fee to do it again,
4822060	4828020	but I'm also not going to say I'm not going to do it, so we'll see.
4828580	4832340	Uh, and remember you pay, so you're ba you basically play a wow fee.
4832700	4835900	And then with that monthly fee, you get to pick, do you want to play modern
4835900	4837180	wow, or do you want to play classic?
4837180	4837460	Wow.
4837860	4841180	Now you might be wondering, well, aren't there going to be people that are going
4841180	4845140	to be pissed off because what happens to vanilla wow, here's the kind of neat,
4845180	4847860	interesting thing they're going to coexist.
4848140	4849300	You're going to have wow.
4849900	4851260	Classic classic vanilla.
4851260	4851620	Wow.
4852100	4854620	And burning crusade that coexist.
4854940	4857620	So what's going to be happening in the next couple of weeks,
4857820	4858900	you get to make a decision.
4859340	4863660	You decide, do you want to move your character ahead to burning crusade?
4864260	4867300	Or do you want to clone your character so you can keep playing,
4867300	4868740	but why wouldn't you just clone?
4868900	4871660	Maybe a, it might be character space limitations actually.
4871660	4873020	Now that I'm thinking this out loud.
4873220	4877020	So most people I imagine will probably just clone.
4877060	4880340	I don't know why you wouldn't do that, but there might be some people that don't.
4880380	4883980	Now for me, I don't even want to bring my character over.
4883980	4888020	I would want to start a draenei or a blood elf, uh, and, and play the game
4888020	4889620	from that perspective all over again.
4889820	4892580	In fact, the draenei starting area is so pretty in my head.
4892580	4893980	I'm making my draenei shaman.
4893980	4894780	This is dangerous.
4895180	4896620	This is, this is dangerous.
4897060	4902660	Um, but anyway, uh, yeah, so may 18th is when that is all being implemented and
4902780	4906140	you get to make your choice and while classic while classic also coming, coming
4906140	4909740	under a little bit of heat because they're starting to do some store and micro
4909740	4913340	transaction stuff with it, with some of the rare mounts and mounts you can't get
4913340	4918340	anymore, but of course people are like, there wasn't a micro transaction store in
4918340	4918820	classic.
4918820	4919340	Wow.
4920380	4921460	Well, classic.
4921460	4921700	Wow.
4921700	4923900	Didn't support widescreen either, but here we are.
4924020	4927420	So, you know, it's a different times I suppose.
4927420	4931100	So, so some things, some things are not going to be a classic.
4931620	4931820	Yeah.
4931820	4934900	Unfortunately though, this is, this is classic Activision, not classic.
4934900	4935220	Wow.
4935220	4936180	That we're dealing with here.
4936180	4938740	So there will be a micro transaction store.
4939020	4941300	Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob.
4941340	4945260	So are we eventually going to have separate instances of the game at every
4945260	4946380	expansion point?
4947340	4952740	In my opinion, there they'll absolutely do this again for wrath of the Lich King.
4952900	4953820	Absolutely.
4953820	4954740	That is going to happen.
4954740	4958620	That is what most people consider to be the pinnacle of wow was the wrath of the
4958620	4961660	Lich King, in my opinion, that's it.
4962260	4963940	They don't go beyond wrath of the Lich King.
4964580	4968780	Um, the, the expansions after that, weren't quite as well received.
4969380	4974020	Um, and I just don't, and I think that the viewpoint is going to be, if you want to
4974020	4974460	play Mr.
4974460	4978900	Pandaria, if you want to play, you know, Legion or something, then play modern.
4978900	4979220	Wow.
4979220	4979740	It's there.
4979740	4980500	It's still there.
4980780	4985420	Um, and I don't think they've really changed Pandaria.
4986500	4990220	Cause that would be the expansion after wrath of the Lich King in modern.
4990220	4990660	Wow.
4990740	4995460	I think they've done little changes to Outland and they've done changes to even
4995460	4999460	Northrend and they certainly changed vanilla.
4999460	4999860	Wow.
4999940	5000580	No cat.
5000740	5001460	Oh no.
5001580	5006060	Cataclysm was after, um, wrath of the Lich King.
5006060	5009660	That's why they have to stop because cataclysm completely changed.
5009700	5013700	Um, am I mixing them up in my head?
5014780	5015060	Huh?
5015060	5017820	I can't even remember what order these expansions were in anymore.
5017940	5019380	It was no cataclysm was out.
5019380	5020220	Not, not Pandaria.
5020220	5023020	Cataclysm was after before the pandas.
5023060	5023380	Okay.
5024820	5025180	Okay.
5025540	5029140	So then my point is, but cataclysm completely changed vanilla.
5029140	5029580	Wow.
5029860	5032940	So they have to stop there because then vanilla wow is done.
5033260	5036820	Um, although of course, could they have all these servers that are frozen in time?
5036820	5041700	They could, I just, a cataclysm was not as well received as the others.
5041980	5046140	Um, I would be very surprised if they go past wrath of the Lich King, but if they
5046140	5047700	have enough people playing it, then they might.
5048220	5048900	So I don't know.
5050100	5050460	All right.
5051140	5054740	Uh, bonds, double six, questioning my choice of going Draenei saying, I don't
5054740	5056060	know, Rob, I'm for the horde.
5056500	5060660	Uh, and bonds double six says the Lich King, just a big man, baby who
5060660	5062020	wanted more than he deserved.
5062060	5064980	Well, you know, some, some epic, epic grades and stuff though.
5064980	5067300	I mean, there's going to be people that would absolutely want to
5067300	5068940	run ice crown citadel again.
5068940	5071620	I don't know why, but they will for sure.
5072100	5072660	All right.
5072780	5077380	Well, since we're talking about classics, Let's talk about a classic classic.
5077420	5080660	It's that part of the show where dark soccer is going to step into the gaming
5080660	5082260	vault and find a game that she thinks.
5082260	5086660	Hey, forget signing up to pay your monthly fee so you can play classic.
5086660	5086900	Wow.
5086900	5091940	All over again, you find this, find a cartridge of this and suffer
5092060	5094340	because this game was fucking hard.
5095340	5098460	I got to, I got to tell you Alan's comment on this pick a little later.
5098460	5101260	Cause he saw me pulling the B roll down tonight and he's like,
5101260	5102540	Oh, I got stories about this.
5102900	5104460	Um, but let's get to it.
5104460	5105180	Dark soccer.
5105220	5107900	You like to step into gaming vault, find a game that kids should be playing.
5108100	5109820	What is the classic game of the week?
5110660	5113780	It is the Simpsons, Bart versus the space mutants.
5115460	5115980	There it is.
5116420	5119900	And so this game is not the best of all games.
5119900	5127540	I will say that sometimes I'd pull out a stinker, but it is notable for being
5127580	5134940	one of the best known games based off of the Simpsons, one of the very early ones.
5135020	5139140	Um, it, uh, it came out in 1991 for the NES.
5139140	5145420	It also came out for the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64,
5145980	5150300	uh, and the ZX Spectrum, and then in 92 for the Sega Genesis,
5150300	5152060	master system and Game Gear.
5152860	5158380	Um, it was published by Acclaim, RIP, and Ocean Software, uh, for the
5158380	5163580	computers and was developed by, um, Imagineering and Arc Developments.
5163700	5169380	So basically with this one, um, you start off as playing Bart.
5169540	5172940	Oh, for the record, the Amiga and MS-DOS versions had a different
5172940	5177460	animated intro that was basically like a digitized clip from the show.
5178300	5182020	Anyway, um, it is a 2D side scrolling platformer.
5182060	5183820	You play in a single player game.
5183820	5188900	You play as Bart, um, and he is the only one who knows, uh, of the, uh,
5189220	5194300	aliens, uh, plan because his X-ray specs allow him to see them kind of
5194300	5197180	like they live, you know, obey.
5198700	5205220	At any rate, um, he, uh, has to basically stop them from picking up certain items
5205220	5207020	they need for an ultimate weapon.
5207540	5211580	Um, and he goes through five levels, um, and he has to either collect or
5211580	5216820	destroy certain objects, purple things in the first level, hats in the second,
5216820	5220580	balloons in the third, exit signs in the fourth and nuclear rods in the fifth.
5221340	5223420	If he loses a life, he says, eat my shorts.
5224180	5228100	Um, and then of course the other objective is for Bart to convince
5228620	5232540	his family about the aliens so that they'll help them in levels.
5233100	5237260	So, um, you have different equipment, you have rockets and cherry bombs.
5237860	5243380	Um, you can buy them with coins that you collect when the aliens are, are vanquished.
5244100	5247900	Um, you have to jump on their heads to get rid of them.
5248460	5254580	Um, and then in some time and the first level you can call Mo and prank him
5254580	5258500	so that you get spray paint, you know, so all kinds of interesting stuff.
5259180	5266380	Um, and, uh, it actually is, you know, one of the earliest games, uh, based
5266380	5271780	on the Simpsons, uh, has the theme song from the show and it was designed
5271820	5278660	by, uh, Gary kitchen who developed Keystone capers and pressure cooker for Activision.
5279420	5286620	Um, and as far as the reviews that it got, it was a best seller.
5287100	5293540	I mean, it sold pretty well, but critics have been, eh, critical?
5294460	5300100	Um, some places said that the game was both difficult and boring.
5301100	5305260	Um, Nintendo power gave it a 66 out of a hundred.
5305900	5312060	And the quote is his adventure though, is anything but a game for underachievers.
5312060	5315700	It is very challenging and could be frustratingly so to some players.
5316740	5327300	Um, but you know, it's one of those games, however, that sticks out in, I would say
5327300	5331860	in the mental history of people who lived through that era, who know
5331860	5335820	when it, who knew when it came out and yeah, I played it and yeah, it's hard.
5336060	5343220	I kind of didn't care for it myself, but it is, I would put it in the area
5343260	5345740	of being fairly notable, wouldn't you say?
5350060	5351700	I would say, yeah.
5352300	5354700	Um, did you ever play it?
5355300	5355980	I did play it.
5355980	5359180	Um, I think I may have had to use the Game Genie with it,
5359180	5360820	but I did quite a bit.
5361020	5363900	I played all of the Simpsons games actually on both the
5364060	5365380	Nintendo and Super Nintendo.
5365380	5367700	So, um, most definitely played this.
5367700	5372780	I remember it being extremely hard and I don't know, just kind of weird.
5373340	5374740	Yeah, it was, it was weird.
5374820	5376260	I was just gonna say, I did not play it.
5376500	5379700	Um, I, I did not get into the Simpsons games until Bart's
5379700	5382380	Nightmare on the Super Nintendo, which I'd played a little bit of that.
5382940	5384540	Um, which also was funky.
5384980	5385500	What's that?
5386100	5387540	I said that one was definitely a better game.
5387860	5391260	Not by much, but yes, better because of the platform it was on.
5391540	5394380	But I will say, so Alan saw me grabbing the B-roll for this tonight
5394380	5395820	and he's like, Oh, this game.
5396180	5400020	But he played it and he said he'd beat it, which I was pretty impressed
5400020	5403020	by because I know this game was notorious for its difficulty for one.
5403300	5408220	But he also pointed out that, um, it had really good homages to the show.
5408660	5411740	Like, especially when you consider it's on the NES, you know, it was
5411740	5412740	where most people know it from.
5412740	5412940	Yes.
5412940	5415740	I know there's Amiga and that stuff too, but most people know the NES version.
5416020	5419180	Like, you know, the fact that it has, you know, a pretty, pretty, uh,
5419740	5421700	true to form crank call in it.
5422100	5425180	All the characters and references from the early seasons of the
5425180	5427500	Simpsons, which I don't know about you guys, but those are the only ones.
5427500	5428100	I remember.
5428620	5430180	I can't, I can't tell you anything.
5430180	5431780	The Simpsons has done in the last 20 years.
5431780	5432500	It blows my mind.
5432500	5433900	The show is still on quite frankly.
5434300	5436180	Um, it has been fairly prophetic though.
5436460	5438780	Yeah, it's uh, yeah, that's true.
5438780	5439180	That's true.
5439180	5439380	Yeah.
5439380	5441740	Cause didn't it, didn't predict that like Trump would be president
5441740	5443340	like years and years before.
5443660	5444340	There's, that's not it.
5444340	5446100	There's like a lot of other stuff too.
5446100	5447620	So yeah.
5447860	5452380	Um, but I think also, you know, as much as this game was not like
5452380	5454900	super well received critically.
5455300	5460740	I think this really speaks to the power of the licensed games back in the day.
5460940	5464540	And I think there's a big difference between back in the day licensed games.
5464540	5468580	And now, like now I think it's kind of like a running gag that things that are
5468580	5470740	based on movies and stuff usually stink.
5471060	5474260	But back in the day, like a license would really sell a game.
5474780	5476860	Fucking look at ET on the Atari.
5477180	5481220	You know, that was, they, they, they, they wrote everything on that game.
5481500	5485140	And even though ET is not solely responsible for the, the video game
5485140	5489140	crash, even though many people like faulted for that, um, it was definitely
5489140	5494020	a reason, um, and I think just, you know, spoke to the power of like what licenses
5494020	5499540	can do for selling games based on name alone, quite frankly, especially in the
5499580	5503900	example of ET and I think why this is a worthy classic game of the week, dark
5503900	5508660	Sakura, because there isn't a lot of stuff like it on the NES there's other
5508660	5512420	licensed stuff, you know, but I, the Simpsons one in particular, the way it
5512420	5517820	sold so well, I think is all because of, you know, the fact that it's, it's a
5517820	5518540	Simpsons game.
5518540	5522060	And because it's a video game on the NES, it looked a little more like the cartoon.
5523500	5528660	Yeah, it was pretty good for a NES game, you know, as far as graphically.
5528940	5529440	Yeah.
5529620	5532340	And I also, I did not know I learned this for the first time tonight.
5532340	5533180	Thanks to dark Sakura.
5533180	5535580	I had no idea the guy behind Keystone capers did this.
5535620	5539220	I loved as far as like, as far as Atari classics go, I think that
5539220	5540660	one is extremely underrated.
5540660	5541940	I may have even done that.
5541940	5542940	I'd have to check the Wiki.
5543060	5545740	I may have done that as a classic game on one of the weeks that you weren't
5545740	5549340	here, dark Sakura, because I think it's, it's that good of a game.
5549980	5551820	That's why I brought it up.
5552020	5552500	Oh, okay.
5552500	5553500	Well, there you go.
5553700	5554660	That was a long time ago though.
5554660	5555980	If I did, I don't remember talking about it.
5555980	5557140	It was probably a while ago, but yeah.
5558140	5560620	Um, that's the, that's the game.
5560860	5561380	All right.
5561380	5561940	There it is.
5561980	5563180	Bart versus the space moons.
5563220	5566060	Um, before I take us back here, I do want to point out, um, in chat
5566060	5569260	quest buster is saying a claim was huge on licensed games.
5569260	5570660	They also made a lot of bad games.
5570660	5571140	That's right.
5571140	5574300	They, they made some good stuff and they made some bad stuff.
5574500	5577460	Weren't they also, um, wizards and warriors.
5577500	5578380	Wasn't that a claim?
5579900	5581620	No, that was, or was that rare?
5582060	5582660	That was rare.
5582700	5584420	I think it, no, I don't think it was rare.
5584420	5584700	Hold on.
5584700	5585380	I'll double check.
5585700	5586020	Okay.
5587220	5588420	Um, let's see.
5588420	5591980	And then, uh, the, the many folks in chat claim, it is a claim.
5591980	5592220	Okay.
5592500	5595620	And then many folks in chat talking about, um, arcade Simpsons being
5595620	5597300	the one that people really remember.
5597580	5599060	Yes, absolutely.
5599060	5602100	But for whatever reason, and probably just due to the licensing issues and
5602100	5607020	stuff, the, the arcade version of the Simpsons never existed on the NES.
5607020	5607500	Correct me if I'm wrong.
5607500	5609140	They finally got the Ninja turtles game on it.
5609300	5611860	I don't think they ever did the arcade Simpsons on the NES.
5611860	5615820	I don't think it was till there may have been PC version, I think,
5616020	5617260	uh, or a computer version.
5617660	5620700	But, um, yeah, that's the one that certainly a lot of people remember.
5621060	5621380	Okay.
5621380	5626460	So DJ Rama asks, uh, on the wizards and warriors, it was both rare developed
5626460	5629620	it, a claim published it, so it was both names on that.
5629620	5630780	That's why my brain was hurting.
5631180	5631620	Okay.
5632180	5632580	Awesome.
5633700	5634620	Uh, orange, right.
5634620	5636260	Says it was only ported to dos.
5636260	5636420	Yeah.
5636420	5637700	I thought I remember playing this one.
5637700	5641740	He also thinks maybe Commodore 64, which surprises me, but also doesn't
5641740	5645900	because the Commodore 64 was still a huge platform into the early
5645900	5647300	nineties and other countries.
5647340	5648780	So interesting.
5649300	5649540	All right.
5649540	5652180	Anyway, uh, a lot to say on that one.
5652180	5652380	Huh?
5652380	5653580	Great pick dark Sakura.
5653620	5656060	I mean, yeah, it's not, it's not something that's remembered for being
5656060	5661860	great, but I think it is remembered for being, um, Important, I guess, you
5661860	5665740	know, not just in it's, it's a urban legend of how fucking hard it is, but
5665740	5670060	just a licensed game that really kind of sold a lot on the NES.
5670380	5676180	So, all right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some
5676180	5678540	other things going on in the industry kind of quickly here.
5678540	5679740	So Loki, we'll start with you.
5680500	5680740	Yeah.
5680740	5683700	I came, I need to go back and play as a Yakuza, like a dragon.
5683700	5688860	And it's kind of cool to see that there, uh, the studio behind it is
5688860	5693900	actually talking about some future releases in the, uh, Yakuza series.
5694180	5699060	And they're saying that they're going to be following the same game style
5699100	5702900	with turn-based RPG combat instead of just the standard brawler.
5702900	5705260	So, uh, I'm all about that.
5705340	5707340	I can't wait to check out the new game.
5707420	5710940	Um, so coming soon, I guess at some point.
5712060	5719100	And then, um, for PlayStation plus in may, we've got a few games that are going to
5719100	5721140	be available, uh, with your subscriptions.
5721140	5727220	So looks like a rec fest on PlayStation five stranded deep on PlayStation four
5727260	5730060	and battlefield five on PlayStation four.
5730180	5732260	And those are available until June 1st.
5732900	5734580	Um, cool.
5736380	5736780	All right.
5736780	5740860	And, um, Bobby and chat mentioning that judgment is the brawler line.
5740860	5743180	And yeah, I caught that about that split with Yakuza.
5743540	5748500	Does that speak to the Yakuza, like a dragon performed pretty darn well.
5748500	5752180	And so they want to make more games like that, but that might have helped
5752180	5756700	that it was one of the only truly, um, next gen titles available when
5756700	5759580	series X launched, I think, uh, probably help.
5759580	5762660	I still need to play it, um, at some point, but I, you know, I know Bobby
5762660	5764980	played through the whole thing and really enjoyed it and he's not the
5764980	5766380	only one I've heard kind of mentioned that.
5766380	5769140	So that's interesting that the, the series is kind of pivoting like that,
5769140	5771860	but at the same time, you know, you know, there'd be people that would be
5771860	5775660	pissed if the main Yakuza series, you know, completely took that over and,
5775660	5776460	and adopt that format.
5776460	5779140	So it's nice that the judgment series kind of also exists for
5779140	5782460	fans of, uh, you know, classic Yakuza as it were at this point.
5782700	5783300	So, yeah.
5783700	5784060	All right.
5784580	5788940	Um, Questbuster says, as someone that has played every game in the Yakuza
5788940	5793500	series, except for the Japan only releases like Isshin, uh, I'm okay with
5793500	5794100	this change.
5794180	5797140	I think, I think most people are because both games still exist.
5797140	5798460	They just have different titles.
5798540	5799460	It's not the end of the world.
5799460	5800580	You can buy, you can buy both.
5800580	5801180	You can buy neither.
5801180	5801980	You can buy one or the other.
5802740	5803020	All right.
5803020	5804100	Uh, Dar Sakura, please.
5805220	5812260	So, uh, Shirley, who is, uh, Shirley Curry, who is the, uh, uh, Skyrim playing
5812260	5819540	grandma, um, she actually now has her own mod and she's provided her voice for it.
5820300	5826100	Um, so it's, uh, basically called Shirley, a Skyrim, uh, mod.
5826580	5828620	She, uh, it's up on Nexus.
5828660	5834420	She's in there as a, uh, she'll give you some stories of her adventures and has a
5834420	5837340	little house and some unique items and a quest to complete.
5838060	5840820	She has been immortalized in the game she loves.
5841340	5841940	That's awesome.
5841940	5842260	Thank you.
5842260	5842740	Modders.
5842780	5844100	Also, you can't marry her.
5846300	5851420	Well, wait, wait, until, until the modders mod the mod.
5852420	5854780	I think, I think it was one of the things she decided.
5855580	5857260	They will, they will do it.
5857860	5862260	Can the modders mod the mod and make grandma's neighbor mod.
5863060	5864260	Starring Bea Arthur.
5864820	5865460	Yes.
5865460	5866820	So, and next story.
5866900	5868300	And then there's mod.
5869340	5870020	All right, go ahead.
5870380	5870780	Okay.
5871260	5873540	Nobody under 40 is going to understand what I just did.
5873580	5874300	All right, go ahead.
5875220	5881220	Avex, which we know Avex, uh, tracks great, you know, music producer is going
5881220	5886460	to be bringing back cyber trance series, but a little bit more modern.
5886980	5891980	Um, it was, is definitely one of those, uh, compilations that I really
5891980	5897900	enjoyed, uh, you know, in the, the early aughts and I think it's going to be great.
5898060	5902940	They've also brought out a cybertrance, the fifth cybertrance YouTube channel.
5903500	5911260	And, um, they, uh, are bringing back also the Velfar cybertrance series is
5911260	5913100	going to be available for streaming.
5913100	5916460	So that's really awesome.
5916500	5917820	And they're going to take all that money.
5918020	5919220	I I'm excited for this too.
5919220	5923020	Jason even references in the intro that he's, you know, shout out to Jason, who
5923020	5926940	does all our voiceovers here, if you didn't know, um, he, uh, uh, was talking
5926980	5929820	about that in the intro and I'm like, yep, pretty much the same, you know, I'm,
5929820	5930780	I'm looking forward to this too.
5930780	5932700	I didn't know they already had stuff posted on YouTube.
5933020	5936100	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, uh, the song on their YouTube was pretty sick.
5936260	5937740	So I'm going to need to check that out.
5938180	5943100	I just hope, unlike last time, I hope this time they put it up on streaming
5943100	5948220	services so that we're not just having to trade like burn CDs, um, which I know
5948220	5951860	you're not really sure check Apple music real quick, which please do.
5951860	5953500	Cause if it's there, it's going to be everywhere.
5953500	5959300	Um, uh, but, um, now in the days, you know, the nice thing is the streaming
5959300	5962100	services, you're seeing more of the international stuff, especially when it
5962100	5965060	comes to video game stuff, uh, is going on those services.
5965060	5966460	So that's pretty cool.
5966900	5969420	Um, sadly, what's still not on streaming services.
5969420	5974460	Cause I was just thinking about this the other day is that the dance maniacs
5974500	5979300	series that a lot of the DDR originals came from still not on, so there are
5979540	5985300	some cybertrance stuff up on there, but I don't see anything really recent.
5985300	5989420	There's, uh, the, uh, uh, Hamasaki Ayumi stuff.
5989460	5991820	There's cybertrance presents iutrance too.
5992300	5997900	So it's some of the, um, older stuff is up there, but the stuff is there.
5998980	6003980	I remember what put me down that road because I realized Spotify released a
6003980	6009260	lot of back catalog erotic, the band that was in DDR, you know, do it all night.
6009380	6010980	Do we have all that stuff?
6011180	6014500	So their back catalog, like all their CDs are available on Spotify now.
6014500	6017260	And I imagine if it's there, it's Apple music and you know, all the places you
6017260	6023500	listen to music, um, and, uh, the, including their ABBA album, which I'm
6023500	6027420	gonna tell you the cover of angel eyes that erotic does, which is a very
6027420	6028540	underrated ABBA song.
6028540	6031580	Number one, number two, erotic does a killer job of that song.
6031780	6037100	So that made me think, where's that dance mania erotic nonstop mega mix.
6037420	6038340	Remember that album?
6038660	6039540	That album was great.
6039660	6041060	That's where cat's eye came from.
6041060	6042660	And then they had a bonus track.
6042820	6045620	That's probably one of the best songs they've ever had called in in Moncure.
6045620	6046740	And they covered cat's eye.
6046940	6048060	Yeah, that was a cover.
6048100	6048460	That's right.
6048460	6051900	Cat's eye was a cover, but the actual mix and DDR was on that mega mix CD.
6052300	6056420	Um, so anyway, this is, this is, this is super nerdy DDR stuff from back
6056420	6059660	of the day when we were, this is what we would talk about nonstop was this stuff.
6059940	6064380	Um, I wanted that album so bad, but that is not on streaming services.
6064420	6066740	And that made me go down a rabbit hole of dance mania stuff.
6067060	6072340	A lot of it's on YouTube though, somehow, um, without, uh, getting
6072340	6076740	copyright strikes, but I thought that was interesting anyway.
6076940	6077340	Sorry.
6077340	6080580	I know that's supposed to be rapid, but it was a throwback.
6081020	6085940	You, you tackled it ish rapid, rapid dash, rapid throw up, wait.
6087380	6088660	No, in that rapid throw up.
6089020	6089340	All right.
6089500	6090060	Let's travel.
6090060	6092540	Sorry, I've been playing a little bit too much of the plague.
6093700	6094060	All right.
6094060	6096700	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things
6096700	6100420	we'll probably getting be getting a little sooner than the erotic mega mix
6100420	6102580	from dance mania on Spotify and Apple music.
6102860	6103180	Yeah.
6103220	6103420	Yeah.
6103420	6104500	We ain't getting that this week.
6104540	6105140	I'm sorry.
6106220	6112300	Um, this week we're getting hood outlaws and legends on PC, PlayStation four,
6112300	6117300	PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X, uh, Ruby grim eclipse,
6117300	6119340	definitive edition on Nintendo switch.
6119980	6124340	Famicom detective club, the missing air and Famicom detective club.
6124340	6128860	The girl who stands behind, uh, both on Nintendo switch mass effect,
6128860	6134860	legendary edition on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, sub Nautica on
6134860	6139820	Nintendo switch sub Nautica below zero on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation
6139820	6143420	four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X.
6143500	6144020	That's it.
6144820	6145220	All right.
6145420	6146660	Let's travel over to Japan.
6146940	6148020	Golden week is over.
6148100	6149900	So now we're back to release dates in Japan.
6150340	6153940	Um, and, uh, we have a couple of things this week that sub Nautica and sub Nautica
6153940	6158060	below zero pack on switch that is also out this week in Japan, uh, also the
6158060	6162420	Famicom detective club, the missing air and the girl who stands behind, uh, has
6162420	6163900	a collector's edition coming out this week.
6163940	6166660	Um, I believe those are coming out in the U S as well.
6166980	6170980	Uh, and, um, I know some folks are looking forward to that, but those,
6170980	6172140	the Japan's getting it too.
6172500	6175340	Uh, so those are out on may 14th and that's, what's on the switch.
6175580	6180660	Uh, PlayStation five actually gets sub Nautica below zero as well in Japan this
6180660	6180940	week.
6180940	6182300	So you have that to look forward to.
6182660	6186540	And then on the PlayStation four, um, we have the sub Nautica below
6186540	6188220	zero and that's about it.
6188260	6193260	Um, uh, Oh, Moto GP 21 is also out this week on PlayStation four.
6193580	6196460	Um, not the mass effect legendary edition in Japan.
6196820	6200140	I imagine they'll have to wait a little bit to get a localized version of that.
6200820	6201860	Uh, how about the UK?
6201860	6202380	Darc, Sakura?
6203500	6204860	Oh, only a handful.
6205180	6206940	We have all on the 14th.
6206940	6208220	We have Brigadine.
6208700	6212340	We have sub Nautica below zero and mass effect, legendary edition.
6214060	6214580	All right.
6214980	6216740	Well, with mass effect, what else do you need?
6218420	6218700	All right.
6218700	6220220	We have, did you say what else?
6220220	6221460	Because those don't exist.
6223780	6226260	All right, let's move on.
6226980	6229860	Uh, we have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to
6229860	6231020	get to the listener round table.
6231580	6232980	I'm putting a new twist on it tonight.
6233580	6235780	I haven't even told my co-host, but it'll be a good one.
6236060	6237900	We're putting a new twist on the listener round table tonight.
6238220	6239980	So I'll talk to more about that in a minute.
6240660	6241460	What a twist.
6241540	6242180	What a twist.
6242340	6245100	I know I'm M Night Shyamalan-ing this right now, so let's do it.
6245740	6246300	All right.
6246740	6247540	Loki, what's next?
6248180	6252700	So there's apparently a class action lawsuit against Sony
6252740	6254300	over the PlayStation store.
6254340	6259460	They call it a price monopoly being that, Hey, it is on the PlayStation
6259460	6263180	and there's only one storefront that you can purchase games on the PlayStation.
6263380	6268340	As such games are probably more expensive on there than you would
6268340	6271540	find at retail in a competitive market.
6271580	6272620	They're alleging.
6273820	6275820	Nobody tell these guys about the eShop.
6275860	6276340	Okay.
6276980	6278740	Nintendo actually, you know, I take that back.
6278740	6281260	Nintendo is just ridiculous prices all the time.
6281700	6285580	Um, and that's both physical and, uh, digital, but can't you buy
6285580	6286940	Nintendo stuff on Humble Bundle?
6287620	6292380	You can, but it's not like what I'm complaining about is that they've
6292380	6296780	got, you know, their gains are always $60 and they never discount them eventually.
6297300	6300100	Um, it's very rare that you find that stuff discounted.
6300100	6305780	Although I must say that I visited the local Target and they have a good stack
6305780	6308780	of gaming watches marked down to $49.99.
6309540	6315620	So, you know, maybe time, maybe soon time to pick one of those up.
6316700	6318140	Let's wait till they get lower.
6318660	6319460	$19.99.
6319500	6319660	Yeah.
6319660	6321020	Wait, wait for $19.99.
6321020	6321660	Absolutely.
6323380	6323860	All right.
6323860	6325380	Yeah, that's what they're alleging so far.
6325380	6328580	They didn't give any sort of examples of like, Hey, this game is this much here.
6328580	6329700	And this much here.
6329980	6331380	Um, it's right now, it's a complaint.
6331500	6336700	I'm guessing probably just to take, you know, aim at Sony when Epic is taking
6336700	6338820	aim at Apple and then granted if.
6339420	6343180	However, the court, you know, rules with the whole Apple thing, you know, about
6343180	6346940	having multiple storefronts available on, you know, kind of these, uh, closed
6346940	6350940	marketplaces, we'll see how that affects some of these other storefronts.
6351260	6353980	Somebody's trying to set the stage to have it trickle down to PlayStation.
6353980	6354500	Basically.
6354500	6357300	I think that's what they're trying, but I think it, it's going
6357300	6358220	to be a hard sell right now.
6358300	6358660	It is.
6358660	6359940	It's, it's going to be a bit of a gamble.
6359940	6360500	That's for sure.
6361060	6361300	Yeah.
6361900	6362260	All right.
6363020	6364780	Um, well, we're going to go to the next story.
6364820	6366500	Um, unfortunately my computer froze.
6366500	6367980	Can anyone assist me on the next story here?
6368940	6370220	Um, sure.
6371100	6372540	Um, Oh, go ahead.
6372540	6373140	Do you want to do it?
6373740	6374580	Uh, you can do it.
6374660	6375100	Sorry.
6375100	6375260	Okay.
6375300	6376540	Live radio sucks.
6376620	6379980	So as we were talking about, um, you know, and it just makes sense.
6379980	6384100	Uh, games com 2021 is going to be an online only event after all.
6384300	6387820	Originally they were talking about some sort of, you know, a hybrid
6387820	6391300	event, but now it's just, let's just go digital.
6391420	6394980	I mean, with the way the pandemic is, you know, better safe than sorry.
6394980	6399340	So a lot of folks, you know, already different events going purely digital.
6399580	6402100	So it makes sense that this year they're going to be doing the same.
6402580	6404740	Um, it's still going to be happening.
6404740	6407860	It looks like August 25th through the 27th.
6408020	6412180	So we'll have to look forward to what they're going to announce during that time.
6414100	6414420	Yay.
6415140	6415500	Awesome.
6415540	6419700	Well, well, and I have some interesting news as well.
6421380	6422220	It is my turn, right?
6422340	6423060	Yes, please.
6423740	6424220	Okay.
6424580	6432220	Um, we have our inductees to the 2021 world video game hall of fame.
6432660	6436460	Got some interesting ones on here and none of them are surprising, except
6436460	6438300	that they haven't already been there.
6438940	6446260	So out of all of these, uh, finalists, we now have star craft.
6447180	6450140	We have where in the world is Carmen San Diego?
6450380	6451340	Of course.
6452220	6456260	Microsoft flight simulator, which I think that one's been a bit overdue
6456540	6462860	and drum roll, the very first animal crossing, which was out in Japan as
6462860	6473340	double tsunami E plus the game P version finally, and it is a well-deserved.
6473380	6476900	Well-deserved they're all really, really top-notch inductees.
6478220	6480900	Is there some type of maybe like age requirement?
6481380	6484500	I mean, I don't know if you know, but maybe there's an agent because, um, that
6484500	6486180	game would be right about 20 years old.
6486580	6488140	So it was like the rock and roll hall of fame.
6488140	6491140	I think you have to have your first single or whatever, like 30, 20 years.
6491140	6491500	I don't remember.
6491740	6494020	So maybe there's something with that going on there.
6494740	6498060	Just saying, has it be on our classic game of the week list?
6498060	6503260	So, you know, anybody, they're just leeching on our shit.
6503620	6503940	Yeah.
6505220	6507740	We, we have, we have our own hall of fame.
6507780	6508340	That's for sure.
6508660	6509380	We do.
6510180	6510460	All right.
6510460	6511740	There's some sticky ones in there.
6512980	6514540	Uh, let's move on Loki.
6515740	6517500	So this is stupid.
6517740	6522940	Um, I'm just going to say that now, but apparently there is a blizzard is blocking
6522980	6527340	or has filed a notice of opposition with the patent and trademark office to block
6527380	6535140	Fox, uh, as in the, the television network from trademarking Diablo as one of the
6535140	6540140	canine characters in the brand new, uh, series housebroken, which is about dogs.
6540700	6548700	So, um, blizzard is stating that there may be, um, some confusion that says in the
6548700	6552860	view of the fact that the marks at issue are identical and in consideration of
6552860	6557340	other factors, such as a relationship between the imposter's goods and services
6557340	6561020	as identified by market Diablo and applicants goods and their commercial
6561020	6564500	strength, uh, it's likely members of the public will erroneously believe that
6564500	6567100	applicants goods, basically they're saying they're going to be confused.
6567580	6572180	I'm not going to be confused when I see, and as they say, the different things
6572180	6578180	that they're going to be using this patent for a trademark for, um, Diablo
6578300	6582980	pet bowls or pet treats, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to think that, Oh,
6583020	6584780	blizzard's putting out pet treats.
6585100	6590060	Blizzard has pet litter that they're marketing their game with.
6590660	6592140	It's stupid.
6592220	6594380	It is absolutely stupid.
6594420	6597580	And I hope that they punish them for this because it's ridiculous.
6597660	6601460	I'm not as likely to fall as hard on blizzard on this.
6601660	6605340	Um, I think the issue is that Fox wants a trademark on Diablo.
6605940	6609180	And so blizzard wants to protect their existing trademark.
6609220	6612780	Uh, yes, it's a stretch, a lot of these things, but what about a
6612780	6616020	t-shirt that says Diablo on it?
6616500	6617420	What are they talking about?
6617500	6618980	They're talking about the dog and they're talking about the game.
6619180	6621180	Now, I guess a lot of that's going to depend on what's it look like.
6621580	6622260	Yeah, exactly.
6622300	6629700	Like, so like the name Diablo, I mean, there's, we have, we have a park in
6629700	6633180	California for, well, there's a volcano or there used to be a walking Mount
6633180	6636180	Diablo, um, are they going to Sue the mountain?
6636340	6640180	I mean, no, no, because the mountain's not trying to trademark the name.
6641260	6642060	But it doesn't matter though.
6642060	6646820	Like if the, if the actual treatments are like completely different, I don't
6646820	6649140	see the point what they're going to be.
6649500	6650940	There's no confusion is what they're.
6651420	6653660	I mean, they have to say that there's confusion because otherwise they don't
6653660	6656540	have a case, but like it, there's no confusion here.
6656780	6657460	I agree.
6657460	6658340	It's a stretch.
6658420	6663420	What I don't agree with is that I do think that blizzard is taking issue.
6663460	6665900	I see how blizzard ended up in court with this.
6665900	6668380	They're taking issue to the fact that someone else is trying to trademark
6668380	6673220	Diablo, perhaps if they don't defend it, then they look like they're willing to
6673220	6676260	give it up or whatever, especially when they've got a couple of games coming out
6676260	6679220	on the way and there's going to be a lot of merchandise, although yes, of course, I
6679220	6683020	believe that both yes, Diablo, the game is not going to have pet food.
6683140	6684300	Like that would be ridiculous.
6684580	6688860	Um, but I think when it comes down to the more generic stuff, like, you know, shirts
6688860	6692740	and stuff, it's, it's really going to have to be about that look and I'm not sure.
6692740	6693820	And this is part of why.
6694620	6699580	These sorts of laws need to be, um, updated and stuff is that we know Diablo
6699580	6703180	is Diablo when it's in a certain font and it's in red and, you know, looks all
6703180	6705020	Satan-y for lack of a better term.
6705020	6705340	Right.
6705500	6707100	That's what we know Diablo.
6707180	6709740	Whereas I don't think Diablo, the dog is going to look anything like that.
6710340	6711980	So I don't know.
6712380	6715980	Phoenix 77 26 is telling me this is a stretch Armstrong stretch.
6716020	6716940	Very stretchy.
6716980	6722380	Well, um, uh, see a Tiberian chat says, YouTuber Patrick star is allowed to use
6722380	6726300	the name Patrick star unless he's pretending to be a cartoon starfish.
6726780	6727780	That'd be annoying though.
6727780	6731220	Like if your, your name was trademarked and like, sorry, you can't use that.
6731220	6735900	It's like that happened with that one singer when, uh, the group lady and
6735900	6737580	Antebellum tried to change their name.
6737580	6738220	That's right.
6738220	6742420	They, uh, lady a was supposed to be the new name and, uh, there was some artist
6742420	6745060	in the Seattle area, I believe that already used that name.
6745060	6745660	That's right.
6745860	6746460	I remember that.
6746540	6746980	Yeah.
6747220	6750140	And they were trying to Sue the shit out of her for a name that's
6750140	6751220	already been hers for years.
6751340	6751740	Yeah.
6752020	6752380	Yeah.
6752420	6756140	So they, did they ever settle that or did they have to change her name again?
6756740	6757380	I don't know.
6757540	6757980	Yeah, I don't know.
6757980	6764420	But I mean, the, the term Antebellum isn't, oh no, no.
6764620	6770620	I just did association, but it's just means before the civil war.
6770700	6770940	Yeah.
6770940	6772900	I understand why they changed it.
6772900	6773940	That's not, that's not the issue.
6773940	6776940	I just, you know, did they, did they end up having to change it again?
6776940	6779660	Cause they couldn't use lady a yeah.
6779900	6780300	I don't know.
6780900	6785260	So they soured anything I could ever have thought positively of them with this.
6786100	6790420	Um, the chicks didn't end up in the same situation though, despite the fact their
6790420	6792420	name is very vague, right?
6792580	6795380	No, I think they actually, from day one, they gave credit.
6795380	6797300	There was like an Australian group or something called that.
6797300	6799540	And they kind of like gave credit to them right out the gate.
6799700	6801460	And I think that's cooler.
6802820	6803220	All right.
6804100	6804580	Fair enough.
6804940	6809980	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's a dude named Mike Rowe who has a software
6809980	6815220	company called Mike Rose soft and Microsoft tried to Sue and lost.
6815580	6816460	I never knew about that.
6816460	6820500	That's, that's an interesting Mike Rose soft.
6820500	6827100	Uh, that sounds like that's more of like, they're trying to make a pun and I, I, I
6827100	6829980	could see it a little bit of problem there, but like, cause you don't just
6829980	6832660	say, I don't know how, okay.
6832660	6838020	I have to ask, how does Four Seasons Gardening Company get to exist?
6840540	6848540	Because now the hotel can prove that there's confusion, maybe they just
6849540	6853900	consider that that's like, well, most people would, idiots wouldn't think.
6855020	6857460	What idiots going to confuse us with a gardening co.
6858420	6858860	All right.
6858860	6860500	Uh, let's move on.
6861580	6865300	Our last story tonight, a follow-up, uh, to something we had talked about
6865300	6868900	previously, um, which is the Humble Bundle.
6868940	6872020	And, uh, remember how we talked about that, uh, they were getting rid of those
6872020	6872700	sliders.
6872700	6875900	You wouldn't be able to donate, uh, as much to charity anymore and all this.
6876060	6877420	Well, well, how about this?
6877900	6879540	Uh, they've rethought their position.
6879540	6884780	I wonder why, I wonder if there was outrage on any internet platform, uh, that
6884780	6889580	was looking like they, uh, were having to retreat on their position a little bit.
6889940	6890740	Uh, yes.
6890860	6894860	Uh, Humble wrote a blog post and said, we've heard everyone loud and clear and
6894860	6897100	apologize for the way these changes were rolled out.
6897340	6901500	We are now taking a moment to pause, collect constructive feedback and be more
6901500	6903460	transparent about the path forward.
6903780	6906700	So long story short, the sliders are coming back.
6907380	6911100	Um, what's interesting, and, uh, Bobby really broke this down on his show, so
6911100	6914420	I'll, I'll give him a shout out if you want to get the exact numbers on a Bobby
6914420	6919460	Blackwell show, but he was kind of going on about how, um, the sliders, you know,
6919460	6921980	they're a little bit hidden, but they always kind of, I guess have been, at
6921980	6926940	least for the last several years, the default numbers they're at are very
6926940	6927420	interesting.
6927460	6935980	It's something like 35% to Humble, 5% to charity, 60% to the developer, for a
6936620	6939660	game and on books, it's even crazier.
6940100	6945620	Um, and I guess the thought is, yes, they can bring the sliders back and it'll get,
6945620	6950220	keep them in people's good graces and all that stuff, but they must think that
6950220	6954140	there's a lot of people that are not even going to bother to check the sliders and
6954140	6957940	just, you know, pay whatever and be on their way out the door without adjusting
6957940	6961820	the sliders so that Humble can kind of intentionally take a bigger cut from the
6961820	6963620	way the defaults are designed now.
6963940	6969980	Um, which, um, is not terribly surprising and, and probably right in that thinking
6969980	6972500	that there's going to be a lot of people who just click the buy button without
6972500	6973420	changing the sliders.
6974140	6979420	Um, but at least there's an option now and you can, buyer beware and you can just,
6979420	6980900	you know, make the decision for yourself.
6980900	6983060	Now, you know, sliders are there, look for them.
6983540	6987860	But, um, I thought that whole, the whole reversal is kind of interesting.
6988860	6993300	Um, I, I am surprised though, actually, that they did reverse their position
6993660	6997260	because, uh, and you know, I think we talked about this when we, this story
6997260	7002380	first came up, but I think, uh, we figured that the Humble store was probably in a
7002380	7006180	little bit of trouble and needed to do something to make some money fast.
7006260	7010740	Um, and so this unpopular decision, because the alternative is no more Humble
7010740	7011740	store at all.
7012140	7016020	Um, and so they probably did this decision as a sort of a, this is how we can kind
7016020	7017460	of save ourselves financially.
7018020	7025100	Um, the fact that they've had to retreat and change this back could end up doing
7025100	7025580	the company.
7027060	7028660	Maybe, uh, we'll see.
7029100	7030500	So, uh, I hope not.
7030660	7034580	Uh, I like that there's options out there, but, uh, we'll see what happens in the
7034580	7035260	coming months.
7036020	7036420	All right.
7037700	7038900	Interesting followup tonight.
7039340	7042660	Let's get to the part of the show where we have our listener round table.
7042660	7046900	So we're going to accept your questions through our chat room and of course the
7046900	7051060	mailbag and something else I'll get to in a minute here, but first let's see what
7051060	7052540	our email situation looks like.
7052740	7057340	Well, we go to participate at orange lounge radio.com and, uh, check out any
7057340	7058820	emails that may have come in this week.
7058940	7059780	I thought there was email.
7060100	7060820	I thought there was one.
7061020	7061460	Am I wrong?
7061460	7064180	No, maybe I, there is zero.
7064260	7064620	All right.
7064660	7066420	I guess I confused it with last week's pile.
7066460	7067060	How about that?
7067060	7070820	Jack race talk, except I'm not really watching anything else.
7071420	7072820	It's not on it's over.
7072940	7076260	Uh, I didn't watch any of the other, other, uh, locations.
7076300	7076580	Oh yeah.
7076580	7078220	There's the Australia one is going on, right?
7078220	7080060	Or down, excuse me, it's Australia and New Zealand.
7080060	7080700	So it's down under.
7080700	7085700	So I I'm y'all as much as I love that show and I love a lot of people have been on it.
7085700	7086540	It's, it's too much.
7086820	7091460	It's just too fucking much at this point, like with all the different countries and
7091460	7092100	all this stuff.
7092460	7096780	So DJ Rama S is suggesting now it has to be dead by daylight talk.
7097100	7101020	If you don't send emails, then Jamie and I have free license to talk about as much dead
7101020	7102020	by daylight as we want.
7102340	7103620	I do kind of like that idea.
7103660	7104540	That's a very good idea.
7104740	7106140	I will take that into consideration.
7106500	7111140	However, I mentioned that we would do something new here and I intend to follow
7111140	7117460	through on that and that is that we are going to get some of your comments that you have
7117460	7123820	left throughout the week in our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord
7124020	7129020	because a lot of you guys post tweets, you post stories, you post things that we haven't
7129020	7130900	always gotten around to on this show.
7131020	7135100	So I think we need to dedicate this listener round table or at least a portion of this
7135140	7135500	to that.
7135500	7141140	And the reality is you guys don't always ask a lot in chat and so I want to get questions
7141140	7142660	and feedback from other places.
7143340	7147140	So we'll talk about some of the stuff that's in our discord.
7147180	7151260	Although now, of course, the week I'm saying you guys don't usually ask a lot in chat.
7151780	7152740	It's blown up.
7153020	7158500	So, uh, Phoenix 77 26 is suggesting, how about dead by daylight versus drag race?
7158700	7163260	And DJ Rama S says this came up in conversation earlier with Phoenix 77 26 dead by
7163260	7164740	daylight versus drag race.
7165060	7167100	Well, it's funny you say that.
7167500	7171060	Okay, let's let's take this conversation to a place you didn't expect.
7171460	7174900	So dark soccer, you watch a lot of dead by daylight on twitch.
7174900	7176140	And I got into this last week.
7176140	7179700	Like you, you have been probably a heavier participant in twitch than you've ever been.
7180260	7180980	Yeah, yeah.
7180980	7182660	Which is great because you're also promoting the show.
7183620	7184140	Well, yeah.
7184340	7187700	And a few people have asked, you know, just when I mentioned to a podcast people have
7187700	7192860	asked, so I'll indulge because it's the one chance I get to actually talk about another
7192860	7194220	stream and somebody else's stream.
7194300	7197220	Yeah, it's, it's usually perceived as tacky to do that.
7197220	7200580	But if somebody opens the door and asks, then it's of course you're fine.
7200580	7200900	Right.
7201140	7201940	So, yeah.
7202660	7209100	Um, so, uh, there's a lot of drag race alumnus that stream and they all stream dead by
7209100	7214700	daylight because again, it's, it's that LGBTQ culture kind of calls to this game.
7214940	7217900	Uh, and, and now, and let's throw Dracula in as well.
7217900	7222980	Cause I think like bitch Puddin, uh, from Dracula does like other stuff too.
7222980	7225860	And I know it's done a lot of virtual drag shows, but I know she's played dead by
7225860	7226900	daylight on stream as well.
7227220	7230620	But, um, on China has a stream and does a lot of dead by daylight.
7230620	7233100	Although she does some artistic stuff, things with her husband as well.
7233260	7238020	Detox, uh, has been a more recent addition to Twitch has been streaming dead by daylight.
7238300	7239860	I want to say he came into a chat.
7239860	7244460	I was in Trixie watches some of the same people that dark soccer and I do.
7244460	7247740	And I think she's done her own dead by daylight stream, but not very often.
7248060	7249660	Like once in a blue moon, you'll see her doing it.
7249700	7255620	If I think, if I'm right, I think it was an LC losing colors stream, which I may chat VIP.
7256820	7257620	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
7257660	7260660	Well, uh, losing color is a great, uh, uh, dead by daylight streamer.
7260700	7263660	Shout out losing color, just kind of cool person.
7263740	7266620	I really enjoy Nick and Prince as far as, um, killers go.
7266620	7269340	And I think detox ended up rating him, uh, not that long ago.
7269660	7272060	Um, yeah, there's a lot of great personalities out there.
7272980	7278220	So another of my favorites is, uh, uh, lopin, I guess it's NA at the end.
7278820	7292860	But another really, a really good one, but it's, it's the best thing has just been that it's bringing, I guess, the community better known and maybe middle known, I guess, together.
7293820	7298780	Uh, and a lot of, um, non drag race drag streaming dead by daylight as well.
7299420	7302100	London Bradshaw is one that comes to mind, who I think is really good.
7302100	7302620	They're really good.
7303100	7304620	Um, who, what deer?
7304620	7306180	I think a lot of people know deer at this point.
7306180	7306940	Evolution.
7307700	7308180	Uh-huh.
7308260	7308620	Uh-huh.
7308780	7317300	Oh, evolution has done some funny freaking videos, Sutton fister or something like that is her name does dead by daylight as well.
7317340	7317940	Yeah, I think so.
7318060	7318420	Yeah.
7318500	7320260	There's a lot of, there's a lot of good talent on there.
7320340	7323020	So, um, yeah, anyway, so there you go.
7323140	7323860	There you go.
7323940	7328740	Uh, there there's as requested by daylight cross drag race talk.
7329740	7332380	Loki's sitting there going, I didn't request this.
7332980	7334140	I did not request this.
7334140	7340140	Also noticed in my background there that, uh, this, so this is earth defense force world heroes.
7340140	7345500	It's that like 3d.game heroes meets earth defense force and the character just dabbed on the windscreen.
7345580	7346980	I don't know what the feel about that.
7346980	7348100	So, okay, we'll see.
7348380	7352300	Bonds, double six chat says, Rob said dead by daylight versus drag race.
7352300	7354500	And my girlfriend was like, who's making that?
7354500	7355580	Cause I want it now.
7355780	7358500	All right, let's indulge one more, one more.
7359420	7364660	Dead by daylight announces a new RuPaul's drag race pack.
7365100	7369900	Who is the killer and who is the survivor in a RuPaul's drag race?
7369980	7371140	Dead by daylight pack.
7371420	7373260	Who is the killer and who is the survivor?
7373260	7374100	Loki, what would you say?
7374100	7377380	No, I have no idea who anybody is on that show.
7377500	7380620	Of course, our survivor, you know, who it would be?
7380740	7381100	Who?
7381700	7383100	The one who always comes back.
7383100	7384260	Hallelu.
7384300	7385700	Oh, Shangela.
7385740	7386300	Okay.
7386300	7387140	Shangela.
7388500	7397860	And then the enemy, the killer would be Roxy Andrews.
7400060	7401580	And she's here to make it clear.
7402220	7403980	Yeah, no, no, no.
7403980	7408340	It would be, what's her face, um, from the one who's been causing
7408340	7410140	all that shit on from season one.
7411820	7414580	Oh, Tammy Brown or not Tammy Brown.
7414620	7415140	No.
7416140	7419860	Um, Chanel?
7419860	7424420	No, the one who was, like, threatening the bomb drag con and all that.
7424420	7426420	Oh, that was season two, Tyra Sanchez.
7426420	7427820	Yeah, Tyra Sanchez.
7427820	7429220	Oh, that's okay.
7429220	7429580	Okay.
7429580	7430140	All right.
7430140	7433940	There's so many people in chat that are like, I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.
7433940	7434900	Okay, I'll wrap this up.
7434900	7437100	Look, hey, look, y'all brought it up in chat.
7437100	7440660	This segment is for Bonds006's girlfriend only.
7441660	7443700	Everyone else fast forward.
7443700	7444140	Okay.
7445020	7449300	Uh, then I would say so for the, for the killer and the survivor.
7449300	7450780	Oh, this is such a tough one.
7450780	7452580	The killer would be the producers.
7455580	7461100	Um, the, oh, light profusion suggests Katya is a killer.
7461420	7463060	That's a really good one.
7463420	7469180	Um, by the way, I don't shout out a lot of the like celebrity podcasts very often, but I am going to say.
7469660	7472660	The Bald and the Beautiful, um, Katya and Trixie's podcast.
7473380	7478860	They just did an episode with Katya and her mom and the mom is, it's not actually her mom.
7478860	7479700	Spoiler alert.
7479940	7485100	And if you know, if you know your comedians, you will recognize her voice in the first five seconds.
7485660	7489100	It is the Tracy Elman, Julie Tanuta, Devin Green.
7489660	7490220	Oh, okay.
7491380	7492700	Welcome to my home.
7492700	7498820	It's her and it's the, it's the funniest fucking thing I've heard in a very long time.
7499220	7500740	So just shout out for that.
7500740	7501460	I will say that.
7501660	7505780	So yeah, I, y'all, I'm thinking Katya is the killer.
7505780	7507700	I think light profusion might be onto something.
7507700	7512220	I think I just would see it except she, she'd be a flop killer.
7515380	7516140	And that's okay.
7516140	7518140	She'd be like, oh, they got out the gate.
7518180	7521620	Oh, well, I'll just do some splits.
7521660	7523020	Uh, so I like that.
7523380	7526020	Um, let's see who would the survivor be though?
7526020	7528700	Like now that Shangela answer was too fucking good.
7528780	7531380	I'm going to say Naomi Smalls, who I'm also seeing in chat.
7531380	7535940	Cause Naomi's got legs like, like Naomi Smalls would have sprint burst too.
7537540	7538620	So there you go.
7538660	7539140	All right.
7539340	7539860	Enough.
7540820	7542380	I promise new stuff.
7542420	7542740	All right.
7542740	7548580	Let's get to the discord where you guys have been posting some things throughout the week, uh, including tiger claw.
7548580	7556540	Wanted to point out that there is a, some eighties action heroes that are coming to call of duty, including Rambo and John McClane from dead hard.
7556660	7557540	So guess what?
7557580	7558380	Dead by daylight.
7558380	7561740	Isn't the only one that gets licensed stuff to try to sweeten up their game.
7561940	7564220	But apparently, uh, this is happening as well.
7564220	7569540	These are movie skins that tie in with the 1984 Verdansk map in the game.
7570020	7570900	So there's that.
7571940	7572340	Hmm.
7572980	7574620	Uh, let's see some other comments.
7574620	7578260	SSJ 100, Matt thought this was right up dark soccer's alley.
7578540	7579420	So let's see.
7579420	7584780	It is a Digimon interactive fitness tracker, a vital bracelet, digital monster.
7584780	7586620	It's now available for pre-order.
7586900	7589860	Uh, and it is a 65 or $75.
7589860	7595420	I don't know what the difference is, but it looks like it's a little bracelet, like a Fitbit, but it actually has a Digimon that's like on it.
7595420	7597140	Like almost like a Tamagotchi or something.
7597820	7601620	So did I say dead hard?
7601620	7603300	Like I was still thinking dead by daylight.
7603380	7605860	I meant, I meant die hard.
7605860	7606340	Sorry.
7606860	7612620	Like I'm like, what the chat is going like, you said dead hard, dead hard is an ability in dead by daylight.
7612620	7612940	Sorry.
7613580	7613980	All right.
7615100	7615740	Um, let's see.
7615740	7626420	Oh, Tiger Claw had also pointed out that the, uh, voice actress and motion capture for the infamous Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil 8 has unveiled who she is.
7626420	7641140	It is Maggie Robertson, who you can find on Twitter at Maggie the Bard, who said in a tweet, so we finally meet thrilled to finally announce I was the voiceover and performance capture artist behind our beloved Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village.
7641340	7646580	Such an honor to be a part of this video game and bring this, ahem, huge character to life.
7647700	7654060	Well, I feel bad for the replies or it's going to be just a mess.
7654300	7660860	Her convention rate just doubled knowing that she's Lady Dimitrescu.
7660860	7662780	I mean, she can ask for more money and get it.
7663060	7669300	Uh, Phoenix7726 is wondering because there is a diehard skin in Call of Duty, is Call of Duty now a Christmas game?
7670300	7671460	Always has been, right?
7671580	7672180	Always has been.
7672260	7679100	Well, he had a Christmas map in Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, the first one, like the old Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.
7679340	7685340	They had a Christmas map, um, that every skin of a map that they did it, that was a Christmas one.
7685340	7689900	So technically it's always been Christmas game.
7690900	7701460	Dungeon Buster sharing an interesting article from PCGamesN.com about after nine years, a judge has thrown out a World of Warcraft patent lawsuit.
7701460	7708860	A court granted Activision's request for the World's Inc. claim of patent infringement to be declared invalid.
7708860	7718460	So what happened, Worlds was essentially claiming to have invented the idea of 3D multiplayer in which a server would filter the number of users visible to any particular player
7718620	7721260	without getting specific about how it wanted to accomplish that.
7721580	7727460	Blizzard in court said that this isn't an idea you can own a patent for, and nine years later, a judge agrees.
7727780	7730660	That's how long some of these things take to settle, just so you know.
7730660	7731100	For sure.
7731300	7731620	Yeah.
7732260	7732660	All right.
7732700	7735260	Um, let's see some other comments here.
7735260	7739580	Some of these stories we actually talked about a little bit earlier, and I don't want to read everything.
7740020	7743380	Um, did we talk about the Stadia thing?
7743580	7745100	I thought for sure I show-rolled that.
7745820	7746500	No, don't.
7746540	7747380	What Stadia thing?
7747620	7751060	Uh, that six more Google Stadia staff members left the company.
7751340	7752540	Uh, general manager.
7752540	7753620	The measurements company.
7753620	7753860	Yeah.
7753980	7754340	Yeah.
7754340	7756820	General manager, head of creative services and more.
7756860	7759540	Uh, they've all left to join Haven studio at Sony.
7760060	7764300	Kind of an interesting wheelchair that was shared by Tiger Claw in a quick little tweet there.
7764340	7765380	So there's that.
7766020	7766940	Interesting.
7767220	7768420	So, um,
7768820	7769860	I've got a last minute.
7769860	7770860	Sorry, if you want to do that.
7771060	7771980	Yes, please.
7772900	7780460	So, uh, one game that's supposed to be out sometime this year, but we don't know when though is Psychonauts 2.
7780740	7781540	Well,
7782380	7787620	somehow the Xbox app is allowing folks to preload the game.
7788780	7796300	So it's about 27 gigabytes and it's being preloaded, but we still don't know when it's coming out.
7797460	7799340	I imagine soon then if that's the case.
7799780	7800620	I must be soon.
7800620	7803660	It will be a hackers will get in there first if they don't watch it.
7805300	7805580	Yeah.
7807620	7808700	Any other last minute stories?
7809420	7810620	No, that was all I had.
7811220	7816500	Well, that was all the shout outs I had from, uh, act deaf to suggesting E3 surprise release, perhaps.
7816540	7818620	Probably a surprise in quotes.
7818620	7820820	Now it got leaked to like most E3 things do.
7820820	7821540	So there you go.
7822020	7827980	Um, so anyway, I do want to give a shout out one more time for our discord vog network.com slash discord.
7828020	7830980	And for all the stories you guys leave in there throughout the week, keep it coming.
7830980	7833900	So, um, I, I found a good place to kind of fit that in the show now.
7833900	7834580	So there you go.
7834580	7837700	We'll, we'll be sure to read more of those, um, in the future.
7838300	7842060	Um, but with that, I think we're down towards the end of the show.
7842060	7845580	If there's no more last minute stories, I think it's time to get final thoughts.
7845620	7847300	Um, before we get to final thoughts, I do.
7847300	7854660	And of course, thank everybody out there for listening, whether you were listening live here on Sunday night at twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.
7854900	7863020	Or if you were listening to the podcast feed throughout the week, whether it was on Spotify or iTunes or wherever it is, uh, that you choose to listen to podcasts.
7863060	7864940	Thank you for making orange launch radio part of your week.
7865180	7866260	Uh, really appreciate it.
7866340	7868820	Uh, give, give us a holler on Twitter at OLR.
7868820	7870140	Say hello, let us know you're out there.
7870420	7871100	Emails.
7871100	7876580	We need more of them, uh, or, or we'll, we'll continue this dead by daylight fan, uh, dry grace fantasy next week.
7876820	7886660	Uh, I just, I almost said, um, my, uh, vanilla mocha fantasy or whatever it was that, uh, Valentina thought about or talked about.
7886660	7888820	And now I'm like, Valentina would be a great killer.
7889740	7890340	Don't you think?
7890860	7891100	Hmm.
7891500	7896340	Anyway, so it's dead by drag races, dead by drag race, drag by daylight.
7896340	7898460	I think might actually be from a pod culture.
7898660	7900140	Pod culture and chat is a good one.
7900180	7900460	Anyway.
7900740	7901100	All right.
7901100	7901860	Uh, so there you go.
7901860	7903420	Participate at orange launch radio.com.
7903420	7908940	If you want to send us an email, um, you guys don't have to, um, give money for the show.
7908940	7910260	We'll continue to do it for free.
7910420	7916260	I just want to appreciate and acknowledge those of you that have subscribed here at VOG network and donated biddies, um, throughout the night.
7916460	7920820	I will read all of you a little bit later after the credits and give you some personalized thanks.
7921060	7926900	Um, but I will also say that, uh, the shop, uh, as well, if you feel so inclined to vog network.com slash shop.
7927180	7930980	Um, and then, uh, of course, um, just thank you.
7930980	7932260	Word of mouth goes a long way.
7932500	7940700	Uh, tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then, uh, you know, so, uh, get your friends to listen.
7940900	7944180	A host here at Twitch probably does more than anything.
7944180	7947380	Even if you don't stream that much yourself, you probably have your friends following you.
7947380	7950340	So a host will go a long, long way.
7950580	7954260	So I thank you to all of you that host vog network on your own Twitch feeds.
7954580	7954940	Okay.
7955100	7956180	I think we can wrap up.
7956220	7956740	That's it.
7956820	7958180	Well, don't forget.
7958540	7963060	After, after the show, um, stay, uh, stay tuned.
7963100	7969020	Um, because outcomes, my, uh, my new segment sounds good.
7969020	7972460	And for those that are on the podcast feed and they're like, Oh shit, I missed it.
7972660	7979260	Um, your archives on your personal channel, dark SACRA underscore O L R are open.
7979260	7981580	So if somebody wants to watch it after the fact, they can.
7982780	7983180	Indeed.
7983260	7983660	Yes.
7983820	7986300	So just, just for the podcast, these don't get to see it live.
7986620	7989300	Um, so let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7989300	7990740	So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.
7990740	7991540	Your final thought tonight.
7992220	7997380	My final thought is going to be working more on Minecraft and, uh, Oh, I, I don't
7997380	7998540	know if I talked about that.
7998580	8001860	I don't remember if I talked about the labels that got, um, so I did get my
8001860	8003500	labels finally for pixel poops.
8003500	8008980	Number two, they were all jacked up, so I don't know what the ha what happened, but
8008980	8013700	somewhere in the shipping or something, they shrunk, but they didn't shrink in a
8013700	8018460	uniform, they, they shrunk and it looked like someone had taken the label off and
8018460	8021780	put it back on and they were really shrunk and distorted.
8021860	8025900	And so I got the back follow up with the next week because I haven't heard back
8025900	8028940	from since like Tuesday, because they were supposed to be resolving the issue,
8028940	8030420	but yeah, they were all jacked up.
8030420	8032460	So yeah, it's unfortunate.
8033060	8033740	They look cool though.
8034780	8035220	All right.
8035260	8039780	My final thought is a very vague, uh, big changes are coming in a few months.
8039860	8044580	And, uh, I, to, to quote, uh, a famous monologue, I'm so excited.
8044580	8045300	I'm so excited.
8045300	8046020	I'm so scared.
8046580	8046980	All right.
8047540	8050220	Uh, dark, dark soccer, your final thought.
8051100	8056580	Um, I should probably make my tiramisu and I'm really afraid I'm
8056580	8057780	going to play very badly tonight.
8058980	8059420	You know what?
8059420	8060460	It's about having fun.
8060660	8063940	You don't have to, the thing about a lot of these, uh, folks we've been
8063940	8067300	shouting out on a Twitch, yes, they're good, but they didn't, they weren't
8067300	8069340	good overnight took them a long time to get good.
8069380	8072100	So, all right, keep working on it.
8072340	8072740	All right.
8072740	8075220	That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.
8075220	8077900	I cannot believe I didn't say this anywhere in the show.
8078260	8082580	Uh, I'm very sorry about that, but I hope all of our mothers out there, our gaming
8082580	8084940	mommies had a very happy mother's day.
8085300	8091100	And if you are somebody who, uh, um, you're just a mother figure, a pet mom
8091100	8094580	or something like that, whatever the case may be a happy mother's day to you.
8094660	8097980	Uh, and all our gaming moms out there, uh, at orange lounge radio.
8098220	8099460	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
8099460	8100660	We'll see you in seven days.
8100660	8101540	Good night.
