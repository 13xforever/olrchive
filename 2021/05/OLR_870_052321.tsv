0	13520	While I was skimming the news tonight, none of the articles really jumped out at me. New
13520	17840	consoles, new games, retro consoles, retro games, fan mods, mashups, etc. I realized
17840	21100	that this was the news. That we are smack in the middle of the transitionary period
21100	24720	where the gaming world moves around between the big earth-shattering announcements. It's
24720	28000	that very pleasant middle ground of news that is all good, but without yours truly having
28000	31280	to skirt around the most obvious thing to reference. This is the meta intro, now it's
31280	35360	time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about actual news. Starting
35360	37200	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
40960	46400	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
46400	52960	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again today,
52960	61280	May the 23rd of 2021 with episode number 870 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining
61280	67440	you here live on Twitch TV at channel VOG Network where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock
67440	72320	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I am joined by, of course,
72320	74560	the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.
75360	76080	Hello.
76080	76800	How are you doing?
78320	80240	I am well rested.
80240	83280	Good. Yes. We were talking a little bit about that before the show.
84080	89520	Yeah. I'm also not used to having like this extra light now. It's kind of getting in my eyes.
89520	93120	Yes. But I love the lighting looks great where you're at. It's good.
93120	102160	Thanks. Well, I invested in a new ring light. Thank goodness for TJ Maxx and the fact that
102160	109040	they've got like 50,000 different ring lights for anywhere between like 12 to 40 bucks.
109040	110800	Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad, but.
112080	116960	No, I'm going to say it because I want my fellow indies out there to be able to afford some good
116960	117680	ass lighting.
117680	123440	Well, and I've noticed in general that a lot of stores out there are starting to kind of cater to
123440	129520	this streaming broadcasting culture. You know, I go into Best Buy and I'm looking for, I think
129520	133840	I was looking for a microphone or something. And there's this whole little section about like
133840	138800	influencers and they have microphones for influencers and cameras and the lighting and
138800	143920	that stuff. It's like a big thing. And it's, you know, obviously we've been doing this a very long
143920	148800	time coming up on 19 years next month. And so it does make me do this double take about.
150080	153600	This is stuff like now they sell it a Best Buy. This used to be the stuff that like you had to
153600	158720	be a total geek and go to Radio Shack to get. I could hear the Travis Donovan, our dear friend
158720	164000	from Understation Life. I could hear his old man rant building in my head about you kids today.
165360	170720	Oh, I mean, it took me, it only took me 18 years to upgrade to a good mic, so whatever.
171600	174000	Same here at OLR. Going to chat.
174000	175920	I can't go back from using this sucker.
177120	181040	Oh, we'll figure it out. In chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network,
181040	188080	Act Def says street vendors in Mexico sell LED lights and cans now. That's fascinating.
188080	194320	You know, I think I've seen like the clips for phones. I've seen like the selfie lights.
194320	198320	I've seen those at street vendors and I see a lot of like the color LED lights,
198320	201280	like like sports fans waving them around a stadium, things like that.
202320	206320	But like to the extent that you're talking about for like influences, it's just
206880	212000	it's fascinating. We're in that type of culture. All right. Well, let's see if our other old man
212000	216000	here at Orange Launch Radio has a has a rant or two about it. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
216960	218160	What's a Radio Shack?
220000	223200	This story. You've been to a Radio Shack, Loki.
223200	226000	Give me a break. I'm sure you miss it, too. Come on.
226000	227520	Are you a geriatric millennial?
229680	231040	Is that a contradiction?
231920	232480	Ask Rob.
233120	239280	That's a yes. It's my one viral tweet. Well, look, Radio Shack was a store that was open
239280	243920	back in the day that that game that's playing behind you tonight was popular.
243920	247840	Actually, I don't think that game was ever popular. It was just kind of like a cult game
247840	254160	that people do, because it's but it was featured in, you know, a feature length movie.
254160	254720	That's true.
256800	262000	And it was used as the theme music for a Strong Bad segment.
262000	265120	And it was so rad, of course, for the podcast listeners who can't see it.
265120	272720	He's got Rad Racer, the eight bit classic on the NES with its 3D mode playing behind him right now.
273280	277200	Actually, it's not in 3D right now, though. It's it is that horrible red and blue thing
277200	282160	when you have it in 3D. But it worked. I don't think it's in 3D mode right now.
282160	286720	No, it's not. It's not. It looked when you hit. I think you hit the select button to toggle it
286720	292080	back in the day. And it's like it takes away everything. And it's just like red and blue lines.
292080	297520	And it's it's not that great, because all you see is like a little added depth. And of course,
297520	302240	the old school 80s glasses that kind of would give you a headache after not that long. You know,
302720	307360	it wasn't great technology. We've come a long way in our 3D technology, that's for sure.
308320	313920	But yeah, it was, you know, that's how everybody knew Rad Racer. A lot of people forget it was a
313920	319040	Square well, now Square Enix, but Square game, because most people only know them through the
319040	325440	role playing games. Yeah, so I don't know. I thought it'd be a fun game to put back there.
325440	331680	Yeah, it is. Orange Right in chat says it's that game from the wizard. It's so bad. Yes,
331760	337120	yes, it is. All right, um, we're gonna get in. Yeah, what can I interject something really off
337120	345840	topic right now? I suppose Lady Gaga got the keys to West Hollywood today. She didn't already have
345840	351760	them. Like I thought and all I can care about are those platform boots she has because I want them.
352320	358400	Like, if gay rights were a Starbucks card, Lady Gaga would have like 1500 still waiting to be
358400	363120	spent on her account. Like, she just now got the keys to West Hollywood. Really?
364080	368960	I just like didn't realize that West Hollywood actually was considered a city that had a key.
368960	376080	Yeah. All right. Okay, well, speaking of off topic random things, I will say a happy I doubt
376080	380880	he's listening, but I'll say happy birthday anyway to Shad Starzik or Shane. His birthday,
380880	385200	it's actually today. So it's not it's not like, you know, oh, it was Tuesday or something. It's
385200	391360	actually today. Bringing him up also makes me think of this. This isn't technically our kickoff
391360	395920	tonight, but too bad. I'm gonna talk about this anyway. It is gaming. He texted me something
396560	402160	earlier this week because he reads he reads a lot of those web forums like reset era and that stuff.
402160	406800	I think, Loki, you're in tune to a lot of that stuff, too. I don't really I don't I see this
406800	412560	stuff on Twitter, but I don't see like a lot of the forums and that stuff. But he sent me something
412560	417520	that was posted on one of those forums, which was like arcade one up leaks that are coming up.
418880	425680	And yeah, I saw that. And apparently the person that leaked it is kind of like a YouTuber that's
425680	431440	kind of known for this stuff. So it's not like out of the blue rando. My uncle works at arcade
431440	436960	one up type of thing like this is. So anyway, long story short, it looks like a Tron machine
436960	442960	is coming from arcade one up. It's going to have Tron and discs of Tron. And I absolutely had my
442960	448480	God damn it moment. And I think we've talked about this on the show before. There's that thing. And
448480	452960	when you see it, you just know you're not going to. It's just you see it. You'll God damn it. And
452960	457600	it's the sound of your wallet just unloading. And that, you know, and I've said it on the show,
457600	462640	I don't have room. I don't have money for another one of those arcade one up machines. But God damn
462640	467840	it, I'm getting the Tron machine. I'm getting it. I have to, assuming it's legit and confirmed and
467840	475120	all that stuff. And there's there was other ones, too, that there was a Simpsons machine
475120	480240	that was in there, too. And I'm I'm sure that one is going to actually be really because people
480800	485120	really fondly remember that Simpsons arcade game. We're talking about this a little bit on Bobby
485120	490960	Blackwell's show because he's on live before us. And a very interesting connection I didn't realize
490960	494880	because somebody in chat during his show has said, oh, I don't know if it's going to be real because
494880	499280	Disney is not going to let Tron go. And we actually were kind of like, well, actually,
499280	504720	Disney owns Star Wars and Star Wars has already had some arcade one up cabinets. And then that
504720	510800	was kind of like the aha moment of right. Disney owns The Simpsons now, too. I forgot that. But
510800	514880	that's why all the Simpsons stuff is on Disney Plus and of course, with the Fox and all that.
514880	520160	So The Simpsons and Tron have that in common. There's a Disney connection there.
520160	530640	So I will find the Disney connection. I don't know. Like I, I know when I saw the
530640	536160	Paw Patrol cabinet, I was like, I was going to say that's that's one, too. I get that.
536160	542080	We never we never had a Muppets cabinet, did we? Because Jamie breaking in a song.
542080	547600	I don't think there was ever a Muppets like game. Well, I think there were like console games
547600	553120	that weren't very good. And I think there were some edutainment Kermit games. And if you want
553120	557200	to kind of tie that to Sesame Street, I think that certainly Sesame Street's had its share.
557840	563680	But the Muppets, the Muppets. I want to say there was like an adventure game on Commodore 64,
564320	569840	you know, because I would have an arcade cabinet. Yeah, nothing arcadey that I can think of. So
570560	576240	there's that. Oh, SSG-100 Matt with the clip. Thank you for that. That reminds me,
576240	581200	OK, I remember when the God damn it moment was it was something that happened with Jamie.
581200	585200	And it was also an arcade one up story because we were talking about the Capcom cabinet
585200	588080	and it had Strider in it. And Jamie went, God damn it.
590400	594560	I'm I'm apparently a meme now. Had a God damn it moment. All right.
595360	600800	Act Dev says, I think there's Muppet games on the Wii. Well, we had everything. Give me a break.
600800	606320	All right. Anyway, so there's there's that little rumor. And I'm like, I'm very excited about the
606320	611120	Tron cabinet at the same time. I'm very pissed off about it. I'm sure you can understand. Like,
611120	615440	why did it have to be now? All right. Well, speaking of classics. Well, and you're going
615440	623360	to have room for it, so. Well, in the future, I might, but nothing as of yet. So. All right.
623360	626960	But you know what? You know what? You know what? You know what? You have a friend that you can
627040	632640	store that at. I see what you're getting at. Who still has no room.
634320	641760	All right. Anyway, speaking of classics, let's get into some talk about Nintendo Switch online
642320	647200	and the classics library that's on the Nintendo Switch, because that is, of course, something
647200	652320	that's continuing to grow. And they just made some big announcements this week that more games are
652320	657040	going to be added, including Joe and Mac, which, for whatever reason, was called Caveman Ninja
657040	664240	here, which is on this. Yeah. Yeah. I always saw it as Joe and Mac. No way. It's the other way
664240	669520	around. It's Joe and Mac here and Caveman Ninja overseas, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I got it backwards.
669520	678000	Sorry. But anyway, that is going to be one of the games that's coming. Magical Drop 2, which I
678000	685120	forgot was even on Super Nintendo, is coming as well. And Ninja Zaya Marukun is coming out as well.
686000	691120	And then there's some differences between Japan and the US. Japan is getting a Fire Emblem game,
691120	696720	Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War. They don't want to translate that for the US or when they do,
696720	703840	they'll charge us more money for it. And then Spanky's Quest, as well as Super Baseball Simulator
703840	711680	1-0-0-0 are additional games that are coming for us here in the US. Now, the reason why I
711680	716960	kind of bring this up at the top of the show tonight is because this means that the Nintendo
716960	724160	Switch Online library has crossed 100 games. It's kind of hit a milestone. Obviously, people still
724160	728640	have their criticisms of Nintendo Switch Online. I think we've all been a little bit critical here
728640	734880	on OLR about it because we feel like there's still a lot of stuff missing from it. How do
734880	739760	you feel about how far Nintendo Switch Online has come? And what do you think is kind of like
739760	747040	missing that still needs to be added? Let me just go ahead and say Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger,
747040	751920	Earthbound, The Guardian Legend. All right. I think I've named all the big ones. Outside of
751920	756720	that, the ones we all know about. What are some things that are kind of like missing? Do you
756720	763120	think this whole Switch Online, Super Nintendo, Nintendo library, do you think it is making a
763120	768640	good deal for having a Nintendo Online membership? Or is Nintendo not doing enough still? Or like,
768640	773520	where's your head at with all this now that we're so far into it and 100 games into it? Loki,
773520	776640	I got to start with you because I know you're going to have something to say about Nintendo.
777280	782400	I think that 100 games by now is not really enough. They could be doing so much more with
782400	787440	that. I'm just having a hard time believing with the catalog that they had before that they
788720	794720	just can't get those on there or like workout licensing deals with these guys. And not even
794720	799200	necessarily licensing deals. I mean, they have their own like first party tiles, not everything's
799200	806240	on there. So I just think there's so much more they could be doing. Dar Sakura, any opinion?
807200	810800	I honestly just think that they're being cautious with the rollout. I mean,
810800	817120	there's certainly games that I would like to see. Like, I don't recall if I saw Kirby's
817120	821600	Avalanche on there, which is like my, that was my Puyo Puyo introduction.
821600	828080	I think they just straight, they just have Puyo Puyo in it. They even put that in the US
828080	835760	version. So I don't know if they put the Kirby branded one in there. He got the six in one game
835760	840640	in the Super Nintendo era with the Kirby Superstar or whatever it was called. And the
840640	848880	mini golf game is there too. But there's a bunch of other just like really kind of quirky games
848880	854880	that I think would be well to come out. I mean, I've certainly covered a few. Like,
854880	861280	I would like to have some more shooter games. You know, if they're going to get some other
861280	870000	third party games, why don't we get something like UN Squadron or, what was the other stuff
870000	874800	I played? Or back in the Nintendo ones like SkyShark, you know, get some of those
875680	878080	cutaway games and a little bit more of the compile stuff.
880080	884240	Good call out. I think, you know, obviously there's the big ones that I named that are
884240	888560	still missing. I think for a lot of people, whether it's licensing or concern about the
888560	894240	lines of Parody and Earthbound or whatever it is, obviously those are glaring omissions
894240	898240	that continue to kind of spotlight what's missing and have a lot of the fandoms kind
898240	903280	of like focused on that a little bit. I don't know if Super Mario RPG will ever happen. Although,
903280	908720	why shouldn't it? Like what does Square have to lose from an agreement like that? There's a lot
908720	913040	I kind of don't understand with that, but whatever. I'm not on the business side of things. So it's
913040	918480	hard for me to say. What is still missing for me that kind of blows my mind that Nintendo still has
919360	925840	capitalized on this is the other systems. Like, you know, if the Switch is meant to be like a
925840	933840	portable system and a system that sits on the dock on played on the TV and 64. Well, there's that.
933840	938560	But I'm also more thinking, where's Game Boy and Game Boy Advance and Color Game Boy? Where's like
938560	943840	Pokemon Pinball? Where's, you know, the Mario game that was on Game Boy? Where's, you know,
943840	951280	the Zelda? Does the Switch have one? I think it does. Yeah. Okay. So then, yeah, that would be
951280	959360	easy. Yeah. So yeah, I don't understand why these don't exist in the library yet. Like the Game Boy
959360	964400	stuff is long since overdue and I hope Nintendo is going to think about making an announcement.
964400	970560	And I would agree that Nintendo 64 also pretty long overdue at this point. Especially, you know,
970560	974880	to revisit classics like Pokemon Snap. Although yes, I'm sure Nintendo would rather you play the
974880	979680	new one, but there's going to come a time when the new one isn't selling like crazy anymore.
979680	984880	And revisiting the old school Pokemon Snap would be a delight, but maybe they're also noticing
984880	990480	people are willing. I mean, they could have given away Mario 64 for free, but why should they when
990480	997280	they did that Mario 3D All-Star collection limited time and charge 20 bucks for it? If it's 60 divided
997280	1002320	by three, 20 bucks for it, and people still paid it. And so that kind of goes in line with what
1002320	1008160	Bobby is saying in chat. Bobby Blackwolf says, Square realized people will pay for their old ROMs.
1008160	1013600	And I think that's kind of like this tricky place we're at with Nintendo online is now it's like,
1013600	1019120	okay, so some games you'll give away with the membership, but others you're so protective of,
1019120	1024800	you're going to sell them in a bundle or whatever, or do a $5 standalone, which I think ultimately
1024800	1028720	is what happens with Earthbound. I think Earthbound will be released, but you're going to
1028720	1032640	have to pay money for it outside of the Switch online collection. And they're going to do
1032640	1040160	something stupid to justify why it's a separate cost. Like, oh, it's a special anniversary edition
1040160	1047360	with some extra art in this menu shell that we put with it and a digital version of the instruction
1047360	1053680	manual. And we're going to have GameStop sell a $50 version of Earthbound that comes with a little
1053680	1061840	statue. Like, I can, I can hear Loki rolling his eyes. But you don't have to hear it in person.
1063760	1069040	Is it isn't this literally their mo like, is anything I'm saying then don't make an effort
1069040	1074000	then then there's I get it that they want to do that with some other titles. But like, if that's
1074000	1078720	the case, then why don't we see a lot of these titles being? I mean, we see some of them being
1078720	1083760	released on these platforms as like collections and stuff, but not everything. So there's still
1083760	1087760	plenty of content that they can be putting on there and other systems that they can be adding
1087760	1091840	on it. And like I said, you know, Nintendo first party could do some stuff as well. Obviously,
1091840	1095200	we're not gonna see some Pokemon games getting added on there because they're gonna remake all
1095200	1100720	those. But like, then why even put forth the effort because that's your selling point. You're
1100720	1105600	like, okay, Nintendo online, you have online access, which kind of sucks. And then you have
1105600	1111280	access to the this library of games, but we're just not going to contribute to it because it,
1111280	1118000	you know, it's gonna grow over our other plans to screw you over by selling the piecemeal to you
1118000	1125600	like, it's not a plan to screw over. And it's the point of a business to be greedy and of store
1125600	1131120	but it's it's why it's why we all hate capitalism. Yes. I understand that. But then don't offer that
1131120	1135200	then don't even offer the games at all. And if that's that's going to be the issue if you're
1135360	1139200	gonna just sell these all piecemeal, then just don't do it. Because right now it's just like,
1139200	1141760	I don't even know why we cover this every time they put games out on it. Like,
1142800	1147680	wow. Good business for them. They're three years, you know, 100 games. Good job. Good job,
1147680	1151920	you guys. That's way more than you ever had in your virtual console stores.
1151920	1155920	They're putting out enough to make Nintendo online attractive to the average user.
1156880	1162400	And they're putting them out as they see this is not going to be profitable to have standalone,
1162400	1167440	let's put it in with the service to again, make it attractive for people to want Nintendo online
1167440	1172320	beyond just a few games. And then the big games, the ones that they know that they're going to be
1172320	1178400	able to compile and have as a standalone, something that would bring in more revenue
1178400	1183840	than yes, I mean, it's honestly it's just business. It's not a, oh, they should do this because it's
1183840	1189840	convenient for us. It's their business model. End of story. And ultimately, the only way it's
1189840	1195760	going to change is to stop paying for a switch online. But I think a lot of people aren't going
1195760	1201120	to do it because there's too much other stuff like visiting Animal Crossing towns and playing
1201120	1205040	Mario Kart online or Smash Brothers online. There's too much other stuff tied to it that
1205040	1208720	people aren't going to want to let go of. So Nintendo looks at it and goes, success.
1211040	1216160	But I kind of once again, they don't even have to put out the games in. Just don't even offer
1216160	1220800	that. Just say, listen, it's just ten bucks a year or whatever it is, twenty dollars a year
1220800	1227520	to pay for just play online. Done. There you go. I really do see like both ends of the frustration
1227520	1234560	because like I also see that like when Nintendo launched this, they launched it with an A-list
1234560	1239600	lineup of 30 titles that kind of really set an expectation. And since then, they've been
1239600	1246800	buoying it with C-list titles and with an A-list very occasionally sprinkled in. Maybe in the first
1246800	1251680	update there were some, you know, but now we're like, let's be real. A lot of these games I just
1251680	1256720	talked about, they're not things where you're going to go like, oh my God. I mean, the magical
1256720	1261440	drop thing is kind of cool, but even I can admit that is kind of niche and most people are not
1261440	1265920	going to give a hoot about it. And so maybe I think that's where some of the frustration
1265920	1270880	in general comes in. I do want to read this comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network
1270880	1276480	because I honestly think Bobby hits it on the money here, literally saying, you know they won't do the
1276480	1282880	thing everyone wants in regards to Earthbound. A retail title, but it has Earthbound
1282880	1290080	beginnings, Earthbound, and finally a localized Mother 3. Yeah, Earthbound All-Stars, 60 bucks.
1290080	1295440	A lot of people would pay it. Absolutely. Why not? And it will even come with a shitty statue of
1295520	1301520	something from the game, a little shitty NES statue or something. I want a Mr. Saturn.
1301520	1306400	A Mr. Saturn, yeah. Since someone stole my handmaid, Mr. Saturn. That's not nice.
1306960	1312480	Remember the one I made for GamerX? Yeah, I do. I do. Someone stole it. Man, those conventions
1312480	1321280	were so long ago. Time flies. Crazy, crazy. Anyhow, so yeah, the Nintendo Switch collection library,
1321600	1326160	it's nice that it's hit 100 games, but I think there's definitely that growing sense of
1326160	1331360	frustration of, are you just going to release these things in a package for 60 bucks? Or are
1331360	1336640	you going to give us more of the stuff we really want? And why are there entire systems that are
1336640	1342400	completely being untouched? No Game Boy, no Game Boy Advance, no N64. Even stuff as recent as Wii
1342400	1349440	and GameCube. I think all of us on the show would happily plunk down the money to play F-Zero GX all
1349440	1355520	over again. It's one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made. Why not? But for whatever
1355520	1362720	reason, Nintendo is just like, we'll wait and we'll do a celebration later on. No they won't.
1362720	1367920	We'll put an F-Zero track in Mario Kart and you'll like it. I also think that Nintendo sort of
1368800	1375760	goes on one of the same principles of a few other companies out there that I won't name
1376320	1382160	that like to put out, they'll put out the expected, expected, expected, and then they'll
1382160	1389120	throw a crazy curveball. The one thing that maybe people have been asking for, say a few years ago,
1389120	1394160	right? And then they kind of say, oh, well, it's not going to happen. And then all of a sudden,
1394160	1397760	boom, this collection comes out and it's amazing. Everyone wants to buy it.
1400480	1403760	I think that's when they've run out of ideas, basically. And then they start actually listening
1403760	1407280	to their fans instead of thinking that they know better. That's not it. Usually companies
1407280	1411280	do this on exactly on purpose. And this is why we get another Pikmin game.
1412720	1416480	All right. We needed an AR Pikmin game because Pikmin is so popular.
1418080	1421120	All right. Don't forget a Pikmin mobile game too. All right. Let's move on.
1421680	1427840	I can't wait. I'm just like, why aren't there more Pikmin games? Forget this F-Zero nonsense.
1427840	1431920	Where's my Pikmin? I'm trying to be open-minded about the mobile game, but we'll see. We'll see.
1431920	1436000	All right. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.
1436000	1439040	I know no one's playing that Pikmin game because it ain't out yet. Let's talk about our gaming
1439040	1442640	weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week. So Dark Sakura, how was
1442640	1448800	your gaming week? Well, it's not fucking Mass Effect yet. So my KVM switch arrived.
1449360	1455120	I will be working on my computer tomorrow. I intended to do it today, but someone slept 14
1455120	1462720	hours. Me. So I'm going to be hooking my PC back up, but I'm going to still play on my Mac through
1462720	1475840	Steam Link. Just because honestly, I hate my PC. I have been playing, of course, a lot of Dead by
1475840	1479680	Daylight because I'm really working on getting better. Although yesterday I had like a really
1479680	1486080	terrible trickster match, but it was also just for me to test my gigabit ethernet on a test
1486080	1491440	stream. So I wasn't really trying very hard. No, that was like the opposite of a sweaty game.
1491440	1496640	What's the opposite of a sweaty game? A well air conditioned game? I guess a frozen game.
1496640	1504480	Frozen game. I'd say it's a fan game. Fanned. You know, like the fan. Anyway, I also am still
1504480	1510720	playing Wordscapes because it's like my brain wake up game. It's what I do. It's my bathroom game,
1510720	1517520	you know? And of course, Animal Crossing. I slacked off a little bit and I really need to not
1517520	1524080	slack off because I'm finally kicking Marina out in favor of getting Cyrano. I like what Siata
1524080	1535760	Berry says. A well ventilated game. Thank you. Thank you. And of course, I'm actually,
1535760	1540320	for reasons coming up later in this show, have a reason to play No Man's Sky.
1542320	1544800	You better hurry. It's limited. It's very limited time.
1544800	1550160	I know. And it's the 31st. So that means that I have to see. I think it runs on Mac,
1550160	1555200	so I shouldn't have any problem there. And of course, I'm playing Fantasian. And just to
1555200	1561920	reiterate, on Tuesdays at five o'clock Pacific time, I stream my playthrough of Fantasian. So
1562480	1568400	for folks who don't have Apple Arcade or Apple devices on which to play this,
1568960	1573600	if you're interested about the game, you know, I'm playing through. I'm exploring things that
1573600	1578800	people ask me to. Probably my next game is going to be a go back and open these chests. I couldn't
1578800	1585120	open session, but I'm trying to get through a full story element each time that I play. So
1585120	1590320	again, for those who don't have Apple Arcade, I'm playing through the game for you and for me.
1591360	1595200	Awesome. All right. It's a service, Rob. It's really a service.
1596400	1599440	I caught a little bit of the stream. I was lurking because I was watching on the TV,
1599440	1601920	so I don't really chat when I'm on the TV. Isn't that pretty?
1601920	1604720	Oh yeah, it's a pretty game. Yeah, the whole thing about it,
1604720	1611360	like their niche on it is that, well, actually, Rob, you can do that through. I'll tell you
1611360	1613840	later, but you have a way to use my Apple Arcade account.
1615360	1620240	Yeah. And, well, it was all about more having a way to play it, but I actually, the show,
1620240	1622960	I could use the show's mini to play it if I wanted to.
1622960	1629680	You absolutely can. But going back to the thing about the game is that it's all hand-built
1629680	1638560	dioramas. So every background is made of real materials. Some of the enemies in the game have
1640240	1651440	real textures as their render textures. So there you go. Honestly, it's worth playing.
1651440	1659440	It's very fun. It definitely gives me a little bit more of an earlier Final Fantasy slash Chrono
1659440	1666000	Trigger vibe. A lot of the music makes me think of Chrono Trigger. And I just, every time I play
1666000	1670560	it, I'm more and more impressed with the story, especially that weird pirate guy who's not really
1670560	1673360	a pirate. Okay. Yeah. I was going to say,
1673360	1676240	I want to play it at some point, and that's actually why I haven't been watching your
1676240	1680880	streams a lot, because I don't want to spoil myself. But for those that know they're not
1680880	1684880	going to get around to it anytime soon, it's a good way to check it out. All right.
1686400	1688320	Moving on, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1689600	1695280	So my gaming week was still Minecraft, still playing on the server, still editing video.
1696080	1700480	The second video is just about done. So I'm hoping to have that done tonight.
1700480	1706720	And then other exciting things coming soon in regards to streaming and stuff on there. So
1707520	1713280	I can't wait to talk about that once I once I can, once I have everything confirmed,
1713280	1723360	but extremely exciting stuff. So stay tuned for that. And then I finally got my labels for my
1723360	1726880	game cartridges for I saw on Twitter, they look great.
1727760	1733440	Yeah, they kind of screwed up the first ones. So they reprinted them for me. And they're
1734080	1739520	looking OK. They're looking pretty good. So I've only got enough for 12 because that's all the
1739520	1744480	cartridges I have right now. But, you know, eventually we'll make more. And I still have
1744480	1750480	to finish up. I had like two levels left I have to make for the game just to pad it out a bit more.
1750480	1756560	And then I think we'll be ready to go. So Dibs on buying one very soon. Yes, I know
1756560	1761520	lots of people want them. I don't know, like, if we should go to Kickstarter out just to do more.
1761600	1765920	But like or because I haven't really figured out how to do the fulfillment part of this.
1765920	1769920	You know, it's like, how do I take orders? How do I ship those orders? I mean, it's like.
1770960	1778560	So we'll see. I would say use your 12 to test this whole process. Have these 12 be for the people
1778560	1784080	that, you know, are closest to you and had the game. So basically, you know, me, Jamie,
1784880	1792160	YYR, Bobby, I guess because he's Bobby. Jason, if he wants one. Cool. You know, like the people that
1792160	1797600	probably drive and then use that as like your test thing and then do the Kickstarter to open
1797600	1802320	it up to others that might be interested in it. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. So. All right.
1802320	1808720	Anything else? I'm a little bit of Orna, just enough to get the rewards each day and doing
1808720	1813760	that stuff. I saw that we're starting someone's remembering to do the kingdom fights now. So
1814320	1818960	that's nice. We had a few of those. Anybody can start those now. I gave permissions to
1818960	1824320	everybody a while ago. Oh, OK. Well, perfect. I just did not use the bot in the discord,
1824320	1828720	although I don't know. I don't think we did last time either. So we'll see. All right. Yeah.
1829360	1834560	All right. Let's see my gaming week. So like my biggest thing is a story later in the show. I'm
1834560	1838080	sure you all know what I'm talking about, but I must sit and wait. So we'll talk about that a
1838080	1843760	little later. So I spent several hours doing that. But of course, I've been playing some of
1843760	1848960	the old favorites to is doing some Final Fantasy 14, leveling up my ninja, trying to get all of my
1848960	1853680	characters up to level 80 by the time the next expansion comes out. And now I know I have until
1853680	1859360	November. That's probably enough time for me to do it. So that's good. Also, your ninja look like
1859360	1864480	like the actual ninja, like for the earlier games. No, he kind of looks different. I mean,
1864480	1868720	also the ninjas have the daggers, which doesn't really match the look from the earlier games
1870080	1875520	a little bit. I can see where there's like some edge influence maybe, but it kind of looks a
1875520	1879920	little bit different. But I like I like the way the ninjas play in Final Fantasy. So I think I
1879920	1885280	have that warrior monk and I think one other one. I got to get to 80 and then everything is 80. And
1885280	1891200	that includes crafting and gathering classes, too. Do the ninjas still throw weapons?
1892160	1898640	Not really. They use ninjutsu is kind of like their thing. So you do a you do a bong bong bong,
1898640	1902880	you do like a three order and it goes by. And depending on what order you did things in,
1902880	1908560	you can do like an AOE attack. You do like a lightning bolt you do. But they do have mug and
1908560	1912880	they have something else that they can like a sneak attack, basically, like go behind and
1914240	1920160	get the mob that way. But they don't. They do have a throw dagger thing, but you don't use it
1920400	1926240	a lot in your rotation because it's not very powerful. But I'm thinking ninja from was it
1926240	1932640	like Final Fantasy six, but maybe I'm thinking like shadow because I think he could throw stuff.
1932640	1938720	But that's right. They had ninja in 11, too. I forgot about that. Yeah, didn't they? Yeah.
1938720	1943040	Yeah. Yeah. But it was very different. It's very different. I don't usually shout these out during
1943040	1947120	the show, but I just want to say Morissimo, thank you, because that's now 10 gift subs you've given
1947200	1951600	away this evening. So that is extremely generous of you. And I just want to say thank you. Thank
1951600	1955280	you for that. You don't have to, but it's very appreciated that you did. So thank you.
1956560	1961520	So let's see what else for my gaming week do I want to share? Oh, Dead by Daylight, I guess.
1962320	1967760	I hit rank 10 survivor, so I'm doing something right. But that's right about I think I've kind
1967760	1972960	of hit the peak of where I'm going until I learn how to loop killers better and get more talents.
1972960	1979120	I only have Dwight's talents and now I have Meg up to 34. So I have like one of hers,
1979120	1982800	but I don't I still need to get her talents. And then I got to work on the others that I
1982800	1986960	want their talents as well. So that's just like it's just a grind. You have to wait a long time.
1988320	1993600	I decided when I play, I'm actually going to go for David so I can just start off with Dead Hard.
1993600	1998160	Yeah. Yeah. That'll probably be the one I do next, honestly. And I bought the shirtless skin.
1998720	2003920	Um, Claudette, I can play daddy David. Claudette was going to be my next one. I was just going to
2003920	2008640	kind of go in order, but I actually don't think, I mean, she has self care, but a lot of, a lot of
2008640	2013200	the Dead by Daylight pros actually kind of taunts self care. It's not a great talent to take because
2013200	2018480	it's like, if you want to heal yourself, bring a med kit. So, you know, just take your, like your
2018480	2022480	challenge points and dump them in a character that you don't want to play that has perks that
2022480	2027520	you want. Like that, like what I'm doing with Bubba. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see. Um,
2027520	2030800	one last little thing not to distract. No, that's fine. I'm officially a plague main.
2031600	2038400	Okay. Work. Officially. I don't like playing as plague. I like plague, but she's hard to play
2038400	2042480	as for me. She's the Vombie Mommy. I know. I like her. I don't like playing her. There's a
2042480	2048080	difference. That's, that's for you. Go for it. I don't know if I have like a main yet. I love
2048080	2053840	Pyramid Head, but I feel like I do. Honestly, I do better as Freddy and Freddy's like the toxic
2053840	2057280	one that people, isn't that funny? Dark soccer, your power. Cause you were the one that bought
2057280	2061280	them for me the first time, but I honestly think Freddy's my best character. So you know what you
2061280	2067360	need to do then you need to level a Billy to get Tinker and throw that on Freddy and then everyone
2067360	2073360	will really hate you. Oh God. Yes. Yeah. No, I do. God mode Freddy right there. Yeah. I need to,
2073360	2080560	or I need to wait for, I need, I need that and pop. Well, you know, pop never shows up in the
2080560	2086240	archive. No, but I actually, I, I, I don't hate playing as clown. I, I get that, you know, for
2086240	2092000	folks with a phobia and stuff, it's, it's not a lot of fun, but I think his mechanics neat. Um,
2092000	2097120	so yeah, I actually want to play him. So like for him and doctor, because I hate what they look like,
2097120	2101680	they really set me off. I just bought different cosmetics for them. Yeah. I was actually just
2101680	2106080	about to suggest that I was going to say they have that giant chicken suit for clown. And that's
2106080	2112240	really funny to me. So I actually put like the ogre looking one on him, the big barbarian one.
2112240	2116480	And then on doctor, I did plague doctor. Cause I really don't like the new one either.
2116480	2121040	I played against a trapper today. I was survivor. I played against a trapper who was dressed like
2121040	2127360	Kratos from God of war. I didn't even know that was a thing. I was like, Oh, that was
2127760	2133840	like a trampus trapper as well. Oh, that's weird. I, but I, I hate going against trapper
2134640	2141360	hag. Uh, those are the two on my list. It's somewhat nurse. If the nurse is good,
2141360	2145200	the, the things with the, I, they, they all have jump scare mechanics and that's why I
2145200	2149600	hate going against them. I'm not sure about pulling up Dwight. I always think of his white
2149600	2154480	fruit and that would be an amazing survivor in that game. I'm telling you like that would be
2154480	2160320	actually Dwight is kind of like that Dwight. No, the survivor we need in dead, but last dead
2160320	2164800	by daylight tangent, and then I'm going to go into something else. The survivor we need the most
2165520	2171040	in dead by daylight. I will, I will hear no, no other candidates. This is the one we need the most
2171040	2176240	is Brenda from scary movie. That is the one we need the most. Well, we have ghost face,
2177120	2183520	you know, scary movie, scary movie was the, um, the Keenan Ivory Waynes, uh, one. And then that
2183520	2188800	the airplane guy, but it had a ghost face knockoff in it. It did. It did. But Brenda
2188800	2195920	was the best and her and Cindy need to be survivors. So it has been a while since we
2195920	2201280	did a list last, you know, I know, right. Maybe, maybe in the future. We'll see. We'll see.
2201280	2208480	All right. Um, survivors for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, let's see what else did my gaming week?
2208480	2212080	I I'm suddenly at a loss for what else? I thought there was something else I wanted to talk about,
2212080	2216000	but I forget. So, Oh, well, uh, we're going to get in. Did you talk about the game that's coming
2216000	2222480	back up later? No, cause I'm waiting for it to come up later. Okay. It's no man's sky. I played
2222480	2226640	a lot of still say you played it. I played it. I played it and we'll talk about why in a little
2226640	2232400	bit. Um, let's see, uh, some other quick little like housekeeping items to get into before we get
2232400	2236960	into, um, the stories for tonight. Number one, uh, we're not going to be here next week, Memorial
2236960	2241920	Day weekend, because, um, I'm gonna keep it real. I was looking at the calendar of like the shows
2241920	2247760	and I was like, we haven't taken a night off since October when I took that trip to Idaho. Um, and
2248480	2252000	I, one of my friends is going to be in town in the Bay area. And I'm like, you know what? I think
2252000	2257200	I'm just gonna take the weekend off. I want a night off. So I'm using some PTO, uh, next week.
2257200	2261040	And then when I talked to, I was like, Hey, Matt, Jamie, you guys can still do a show. And they were
2261040	2268640	like, night off sounds good. So, uh, a night off it is so, and you know what the reality is too.
2269200	2274160	I think just because so many people are getting vaccinated and have gotten vaccinated. Like if
2274160	2278960	you think about it, vaccination opened up to everybody, what, like April 15th. So that was
2278960	2283920	about six weeks ago. So most people that were on it right away, like I know Alan was one of them.
2283920	2288000	He now is hit his full VAX. And I think that's going to be a lot of people this Memorial Day
2288000	2291520	weekend. Um, so I think there's just going to be a lot of people that just want to go
2291520	2298080	do that weekend. Now, of course, I don't want to advocate like, Oh, don't it's, it's over,
2298080	2302640	be careless. No, no, I'm not trying to say that, but I think, you know, and obviously the CDC has
2302640	2307680	said, if you're vaccinated, there's a lot you can do. Uh, and I think it's time that people go do
2307680	2315120	them. Um, so, uh, I think dropping the mask mandate or something like that in June, in June,
2315120	2321840	and it won't apply to really big events, um, where like outdoor events, you'll still have to,
2321840	2328320	uh, either have proof of a test or a vaccination. Um, but anyway, but that varies state to state,
2328320	2333920	some states it's just, it doesn't matter anymore. Um, but, uh, yeah. So anyway, my point is,
2333920	2339360	uh, I I'm, I've got other plans next weekend and my inkling is a lot of you have plans next weekend
2339360	2344480	as well. Um, so we'll just take a week off. Maybe we'll do something. Maybe we'll do something
2344480	2350480	special during the stream or something. Um, well, I said many, not all. I'm actually thinking about
2350480	2357600	doing, um, a marathon stream. Go work, do it. Yeah. Hey, we'll see. Yeah. Um, but you know what,
2357600	2360880	as well, Jamie, if you just want to take a night off as well, sometimes it's just nice to have the
2360880	2365600	rest of relaxation. So don't feel obligated, you know? Yeah. I got 14 hours of that, Rob.
2367520	2372640	A lot of people in chat are just like, cool. We get it. Uh, SSU 100, Matt says, totally get it.
2372640	2378480	I took time off this weekend to see folks I haven't seen in a while. Um, and I, DGRMS says,
2378480	2382880	indeed. I spent the weekend with a friend of mine out of town at depth is bringing up the Pogo
2382880	2390800	special event, which did not play into my decision, but it is a nice perk. Um, I didn't know this.
2390800	2397280	See it to Beery with the random fact about scary movie. Apparently Lori Beth Denberg from all that
2397280	2403360	was approached for the cameo that eventually went to Marissa Jarrett Winokur from, I think
2403360	2407760	she's from hairspray. Um, I didn't know that. I love Lori Beth Denberg. I wish she'd done the
2407760	2413040	role, but I also respect if she, uh, you know, she wants to stay retired or whatever, whatever
2413040	2419600	she's doing. Um, the other big announcement, um, channel point reward streams here at VOG Network.
2419600	2425600	So Bobby did the last one. So Bobby did, uh, he just on like Thursday, maybe it was Wednesday.
2425600	2430720	What is time? Sorry. I can't remember. But earlier this week at VOG, he did, uh, a, uh,
2430720	2436240	stream where he looked at, uh, E3 tapes that he did in the year 2000. So it was kind of like old
2436240	2440640	tapes of what, and it was actually kind of neat because he had a game in there. It was like, I
2440640	2445680	think it was Simville or something. It was a game that was supposed to be like the Sims meets Sim
2445680	2452640	city. It actually never came out, but he had like 10 minutes worth of like filming the footage
2452640	2456800	because they were showing it at this E3. And I thought there was a lot of like neat stuff like
2456800	2460800	that in it. And I think that's kind of the fun part about going back and looking at old stuff.
2460800	2464400	It's not just like, Oh, what's the cringe wrestling event that I filmed. Cause there's
2464400	2469520	a lot of that too. But, uh, you know, what, what were like the things that never actually happened
2469520	2474320	or what were they, you know, looking like there that they didn't, uh, end up looking like actually.
2474320	2479600	So, um, that's kind of cool. What, Oh my God. See it. I'm sorry. This is a tangent,
2479600	2483040	but it's important. See it to be where he says that Lori Beth Demberg has a podcast.
2483040	2488720	What I'm going to subscribe to that one. Absolutely. All right. Um, let's see. So
2488720	2492960	what is the next channel point reward here at OLR? Um, I'm going to head this one up.
2492960	2496880	I threatened this one before I'm going to make good on it, but I'm only going to promise myself
2496880	2501840	participating in this. Cause I don't know if Jamie and Matt want to do it, but we're going to do an
2501840	2507840	episode one, listen through with commentary and talk about the old school days of the show. So
2507920	2514800	with rock, I'm down. What you said when I brought this up before you were, you were firmly in the
2514800	2520880	hell no column. Have you changed your mind on this? I'll do it. I mean, I hate listening to my
2520880	2527200	own voice, but I've had to go back and clip my own stream since no one will help me with it. Um, so
2528160	2538880	I'll do it low key. I had a migraine the whole episode. Sure. Oh, OMG. The value of this stream
2538880	2542640	just should have doubled how long it would be concerning. I think we had a lot of music breaks
2542640	2548720	in there. We did. So, so, you know, um, footnote, obviously I have to work around the music breaks
2548720	2554480	and things like that. So it's not going to be like uncut completely, but within reason,
2554560	2558080	we're going to listen to the whole thing. Um, and just talk about like the first episode is
2558080	2563520	there's a lot of stories about that first episode. Like where the hell did this show come from? Um,
2563520	2568320	why was it like a house party thing? There's like probably seven special guests on the first show.
2568320	2572480	Why was it like low key was one of them. Technically. Why was the show like that back
2572480	2577040	in the day? So there's a lot of good stories, um, from back in the day to talk about. So that's
2577040	2581120	going to be a channel point where we're, um, Bobby, if you have, I'm sorry, really important,
2581120	2586400	Bobby, if you haven't already activated it, you, ah, I was going to suggest he just activated. I
2586400	2590400	was going to say you may want to hold it because we're not going to be here next week. And so
2590400	2597520	that's going to be one less week. We can collect the, um, rewards. So Bobby, I leave it up to you
2597520	2601520	if you think we'll hit it. Uh, okay. Oh, Bobby says we can extend the time. Okay, perfect.
2601520	2605040	So we'll extend it an additional week for the week, but we're off. Perfect. Thank you. Thank
2605040	2608960	you. Sorry, Jamie. I cut you off, but that was very important because I want to make sure we
2608960	2614240	set a reasonable goal for the channel point donations here live. All right. You sure are.
2615920	2622560	So, um, my, um, I re I remember that cause, you know, I sometimes get that,
2622560	2629760	that visual memory in place. So I was on that blue armchair lazy boy or whatever it was
2630720	2636480	laying across it with a cheap headset on like one of my work headsets or something.
2637280	2644080	And there was a computer or TV right in front toward the middle. And on the other side was
2644080	2652160	the kitchen in that big vaulted room. Am I right? That's right. Your, your mic on the first episode
2652160	2658800	was shitty. Yeah. Cause I, all I had was that headset cause we didn't have another mic. But
2658800	2664400	the first episode of orange lounge radio and, and kind of what, one of the reasons why I'm like,
2664960	2670480	now is a good time to do it. We're coming up on our 19th anniversary. So around the time you guys
2670480	2675040	raised the channel, because Bobby said a high bar for this one, it's going to be 150,000 points,
2675040	2679920	but this is, it's going to be a good one. Um, the, the reason it's going to be timed right
2679920	2685600	around our 19th anniversary. And if you think about it, your 19th birthday means you're entering
2685600	2690560	your 20th year, right? And then your 20th birthday is the celebration of the 20th year, right? Your
2690560	2695600	first birthday is celebration of one year. So we are entering our 20th year of orange lounge radio.
2695600	2699680	So I think this is a really interesting way to look back and go like just how far we've come
2699680	2707120	because I'm not, it is no secret. Episode one is going to be really, really shitty. And that is why
2707760	2713360	Loki dark soccer, myself, we all kind of don't want to listen to it, but I also think it's a
2713360	2717680	really great thing to do to just go like, look how fucking far we've come and talk about some
2717680	2722480	of the things we've learned. Like these are the things in episode one that didn't work at all,
2722480	2725520	you know, and why we do the show differently now. So I actually think there's going to be
2725520	2730160	like a lot to learn from it and it'll be really cool. Um, and tiger claw points out also,
2730960	2736000	you've got to take into account the technology you had at the time wasn't as good as what we have
2736000	2740240	today. Uh, and that's very true. Another reason why the first episode of orange launch radio is
2740240	2749120	garbagey is because we were dial-up friendly radio on live 365. Remember 2002, not everybody
2749120	2756080	had, we had screaming fast DSL at our house. That's how we were able to do this radio.
2756080	2760560	You know what? You know what our 20th birthday is going to be? It's going to be, uh, uh,
2760560	2766800	Seijin Shiki, which, uh, turning 20 in Japan is the coming of age. Interesting.
2767040	2773360	Interesting. Yeah. I, I, I, I, I, I'm going to be completely and utterly honest. I,
2773360	2777920	I absolutely think OLR will make it to 20 years. I think at this point we kind of have an obligation
2777920	2784480	to get to our 20th birthday. I don't know how much further after that. I mean, but I,
2784480	2788400	but keep in mind before you all panic and go like, Oh my God, what is Rob saying?
2788400	2796080	We set this back like the second year of the show. Like if we actually hit episode 573,
2797040	2802560	we, we, we have no life. We're idiots. And now here we are on like episode 870,
2803280	2807440	but yeah. And Bobby says that in chat. Rob also said this at the 10th birthday and the 15th
2807440	2814080	birthday. So I'm saying it again. I don't know how we like the show will get to its 20th birthday.
2814080	2820240	Yes. Will it get to its 40th? I don't think it can. I just don't think it will be geriatric.
2820240	2825200	Uh, we will be, we really will be geriatric millennials or geriatric Gen X is the case.
2825200	2833040	Maybe, um, unless we hand the show off to other people, which is a distinct possibility. We've,
2833040	2840640	we've always joked for a long time. Loki's kid, uh, Julian and somebody else will volunteer,
2840640	2846960	uh, can do the show in the future. So anyway, but you know, you know what,
2846960	2851360	though, this is going to be kind of an observation and it's going to make me sound like a, you know,
2851440	2860720	a really old bitch, but I think that having this incentive to stay up with our current video game
2860720	2867760	culture, I don't know. I think it kind of keeps one young. Uh, absolutely it does. But then you
2867760	2872000	also like, you start to look at where video game culture is going sometimes and you're like, God,
2872640	2879200	like, you know, we did this. So, I mean, I, I, again, I don't want to like make everybody
2879200	2882640	and make anybody freak out or anything or like, Oh my God, is Rob announcing retirement? No, no,
2882640	2885760	no, no, no, no, no. But it is definitely one of those things. Like when she started to approach
2885760	2892080	20 years, you're like, how much longer are we really going to do this? You know? So we'll see.
2892080	2897760	And so we're recognized by Guinness. I guess so. Well, we haven't submitted to Guinness.
2897760	2903440	And I think, I think there's a part of that too, that like, we keep going because we are the
2903440	2910880	longest running show. If we stop, we're not that anymore. You know, and I can think of like three
2910880	2915600	other shows that can't wait to snatch the title, which, which they all worked hard and they've all
2915600	2922960	deserved it. But, and I honestly don't know who's the oldest, but, um, uh, yeah, but it's like,
2922960	2926560	if once we stopped doing it, we can't really claim that title anymore. So that's kinda,
2927200	2932400	you know, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I know that's the case with me because kids in
2932400	2936720	the neighborhood talk about games and try to dumb it down for me as an adult. And then they
2936720	2942400	get surprised. Oh yeah. How do you do fellow kids? Like, yeah, totally. I get it double
2942400	2948720	for being, you know, mostly female, even though you're, you're a girl, you don't play games. Um,
2948720	2955360	I hope you know that it's now more than 50% of gamers out there are female or female identified.
2955360	2960160	I know, especially with like gen Z, if you will, or like the younger generation,
2960160	2964880	I thought it was kind of an accepted fact. Boys and girls both play games period. Like,
2964880	2969920	it's not like, it's just part of culture or period. Um, so it is fascinating that some
2969920	2975600	people still hold that archaic perspective, but it's, it's more, it's people our age that do,
2976240	2980800	which is unfortunate. Bobby was saying sadly though, since I don't play Fortnite or Warzone,
2980800	2984480	they're like, well, you're not really a gamer at my response to that. Well, I actually play good
2984480	2990480	games. Uh, my response to that would be like, all right, I'll listen here. You little shit.
2991040	2996720	We're going to, and that's exactly what I'm saying to that child. I actually am playing good games.
2996720	3003120	Listen here. You suck. Challenge that kid to a tournament on a, on the Atari 2,600 game of
3003120	3009840	your choice and watch them cry. You know, no, no, even better. Challenge them to mega man too.
3010560	3017120	Mm hmm. Or one of those or, or battle toads. Challenge them to battle toads. See,
3017120	3020960	see how well they do. Make them cry for saying what they said, Bobby.
3021920	3024640	Play through guardian legend on TGL mode. I'll wait.
3027440	3032720	Uh, let's see. Bobby Blackwell says a friend's nine year old started trash talking me about
3032720	3038720	smash brothers and his dad was like, oh, you know not what you're doing, sweet summer child.
3040160	3045280	Yeah. Yeah. Usually when I get teabagged by survivors and dead by daylight, I'm like,
3045280	3049840	they're a 13 year old. I know it. God, that makes me so angry.
3049840	3052960	And you know, it's funny. This is a big reason why I like playing plague.
3053760	3058160	It's because all I have to do is get the blood puke and chases them out immediately.
3060400	3065360	And then I get the extra blood points. Uh, let's get into some, uh, gaming news. Sorry.
3065360	3068320	We had quite the tangent there, but, and it was just basically old man,
3068720	3073120	and woman yell at cloud, but, um, you know, it is what it is. All right, let's move on to,
3073120	3076960	uh, what's going on in the gaming industry this week. Uh, big news about a big title, right?
3078080	3084720	Yeah. So Overwatch two, they've basically said that the new game is going to drop the team size
3084720	3090800	down from six players to five. And basically saying that the game has changed over time
3090800	3095200	and we've gone from having no hero limits to having a hero limit.
3095200	3100480	We introduced new roll lock over the course of the game. And we feel that this is the next step
3100480	3108080	to that Overwatch ought to be played. Um, so that's interesting. And then of course it has,
3108080	3113600	you know, folks wondering that are on these professional teams with six players,
3113600	3120400	you know, uh, am I going to be dropped from the team? So, um, yeah, it's interesting.
3120400	3125440	Obviously it's a bit early to see, you know, what's going to happen, but with the change to
3125440	3130320	five E five, um, there is a possibility that some of these players will be benched.
3131200	3136800	Now I haven't played Overwatch in some time. Um, it is for those of you in chat, uh, over at
3136800	3141440	twitch.tv slash vog network that do play more Overwatch currently than I do. Is this like some
3141440	3146400	type of response to the fact that not enough people are playing tank? And so the cues are very
3146400	3151040	long for everybody except tank. Like, is this kind of why they're rebalancing it in this way?
3151040	3154960	Cause that was my first gut reaction because I do remember I was playing a little bit when
3154960	3158960	those roles first went live and yeah, like you were going to wait in a queue if you weren't a
3158960	3165200	tank period. So, uh, some folks in chat act def says, uh, kind of in chat. Okay. Good enough for
3165200	3169680	me. Uh, as showing her mat says, yeah, the five player match thing throws things off already
3169680	3173600	strategy wise. Well, it is a big change. It is certainly going to separate the sequel from the
3173600	3179600	original that's for sure. Yeah. So I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's the,
3179600	3184400	I don't think they really outlined what their exact reasoning was for that. Um, probably not
3184400	3189760	to anger people, but it's the change that they're making as of right now. Let's, you know, fan
3189760	3196400	backlash. And in which case they could go back on that, but it is what it is. It's interesting. Um,
3196400	3202000	because, uh, uh, well, the act-def in chat says they're rebalancing because tanks make it a bit
3202000	3206560	more complicated. I was gonna say it's interesting because that creative director guy, Jeff Kaplan,
3206560	3212080	right. Was his name. He just left overwatch not that long ago. Um, you know, again, I don't want
3212080	3216480	to be too like conspiracy theorist or whatever, but maybe there were some changes that were coming
3216480	3222080	that he didn't necessarily agree with that the team wanted to do. Uh, I don't know. I don't know.
3222080	3226800	I don't think it's related. I really don't, but it's, I'm sure I'm certain I'm not the first
3226800	3233760	person to wonder that out loud. So, Hmm. Well, I'll still, I'll still be curious about overwatch
3233760	3238400	too. That's for sure. I wish they'd unveil some more characters, um, and show a little bit more
3238400	3242240	of what the game's actually going to look like, but I guess it's still some time out. So, um,
3242240	3246320	you know, they're not releasing it this year. Uh, we're getting that Diablo two remaster this year
3246320	3250000	and that's about it from well, and then while classic, uh, burning crusade just happened.
3250000	3255600	Um, but that's about it or no is happening June 1st. My bad, uh, soon. Uh, but that's, uh, about
3255600	3261040	it from blizzard this year. So we have, uh, next year Diablo four, which I'm all about that one.
3261040	3265520	And then, uh, Overwatch two, hopefully to look forward to. So that'd be good. Um,
3266400	3271520	something else to look forward to that people have been asking for, for a long time here on Twitch
3271520	3278080	TV is new tags. Um, and I think we've talked about it before on this show. Uh, there's a lot of
3278160	3285120	people that have been wanting a trans tag for quite some time, uh, to, um, help, uh, trans people,
3285120	3293280	uh, find each other on the platform. Uh, granted, um, you know, one of the letters in LGBTQ is T um,
3293280	3302160	but I, I get it. It's not that tag is kind of dominated by a lot of, um, CIS white women and
3302160	3308640	CIS white gay men, like is kind of like what's, what's there. Uh, there's not a lot of other,
3308640	3313040	like, like it's, it's hard sometimes to find trans people within that tag. Um,
3313040	3319360	The other, the other one is allies using the LGBTQIA when the aid does not stand for ally.
3319360	3322640	Yes. I get it. So I know ally is getting their own tag.
3322640	3327600	Yes. That, that is one of the other, uh, 350 tags that is coming. And I also like that one,
3327600	3333520	you know, yeah, I, believe me, I totally agree. Allies should not be using that tag. I it's,
3333520	3339280	it's, I realized they have the best intentions. I don't know anybody. Well, okay. You're right.
3339280	3343680	There's always some people that are, but I, most people, and I'm willing to give most people the
3343680	3349120	benefit of the doubt, had good intentions using that tag for that reason. Um, but that's why,
3349120	3353120	you know, if you educate somebody and say, Hey, here's why you shouldn't, most people are going
3353120	3357200	to be pretty good and change it up. Um, but I think it's good that Twitch is coming in and just
3357200	3360480	making the tags a little bit more clear. So here's what's going on. Twitch is going to be
3360480	3366480	introducing 350 plus community tags. That's a lot of tags. And honestly, I couldn't even tell you
3366480	3370800	the entire list. I think it is linked somewhere, but I'm just, I'm kind of waiting for it to roll
3370800	3376080	out to see what happened. Uh, Twitch in a tweet earlier this week, Friday afternoon.
3377040	3382400	Said we had planned to share this next week, but we've heard a lot of you talking and we
3382400	3387920	want to make sure the record is clear next week. We'll be adding 350 plus new tags to
3387920	3394400	celebrate yourself and your community. And of course, trans. Well, probably came from
3394400	3398160	their blog posts about how they're having a dedicated, you know, a hot tub channel.
3398160	3402000	And people are like, well, wait a second. Why aren't you addressing this other thing?
3402000	3408160	You are one come in, save face. You are 100% correct. Because they went, I mean,
3408800	3413920	I guess technically we don't know what Twitch was doing, but we do know they put out a blog post
3413920	3420480	that was like, Hey, um, we're not going to ban hot tub streamers because they are quote unquote,
3420480	3426000	sexy. Like we're not banning someone for being conventionally attractive. Like that's getting
3426000	3431680	there in category, right? Exactly. They're getting their own category and you know what I cool.
3431680	3436960	I, I, I agree like Twitch is more than just gaming. And if that's what somebody wants to do,
3436960	3441840	and if that's what people want to watch, I myself will probably not be watching.
3441840	3446240	I certainly won't be creating that content. Well, maybe a future channel point reward. We'll see.
3446960	3452320	But for the most part, I don't plan to participate, but it doesn't affect me if it exists.
3453360	3458000	Right? Because that's the same thing that I'm saying about a lot of these other tags
3458000	3461760	is that it doesn't change. You know what? Let people have the tags they want
3461760	3465120	and identify how they want. It's not going to change your life whatsoever.
3465120	3468080	And that's kind of how I feel about the hot tub stuff at this point. Let them,
3468080	3473600	let them do their thing. Have fun. But by announcing that in their,
3473600	3478400	that they're getting their own category. Absolutely. Everybody responded and said,
3478400	3486640	Hey, Twitch, fuck you. Like we've been asking for a trans tag for over a year and hot tub streamers
3486640	3494640	get a tag, get a category first. And it kind of caused a subsequent call out to happen
3494720	3500480	where folks were saying, you know what? I bet Twitch is just sitting on this.
3500480	3506640	And here comes pride month, June 1st, they're going to say, Oh, look what we're doing for
3506640	3511120	pride. Cause we're the greatest company in the world. And here's your rainbow Twitch logo
3511120	3514880	and 350 tags that you've been asking for for the longest time. And you know what?
3516240	3520720	Those people with those comments were absolutely right. Clearly. And Twitch realized,
3520720	3524800	fuck, if we now announce this on June 1st, the start of pride month,
3525440	3529760	we're going to look super performative and that it's just a corporate thing and all this other
3529760	3534720	stuff. And so that's why they announced it Friday afternoon. And they said, we'd plan to announce
3534720	3541200	this next week. Well, what's next week, the weekend leading up to June 1st.
3542960	3546720	So it was performative. So yes, it was absolutely planned to be this,
3546720	3554480	but you know what? It's movement in the right direction. Yes. We can say about fucking time.
3554480	3559760	Yes. We can say you only did this because XYZ, but I think at the same time we have to go and we say,
3560320	3566240	but you did it. Thank you. The community asks for this. You're finally giving it to the community.
3566240	3570320	Thank you. Let's move forward and build a stronger community together now that we have what we've
3570320	3573920	been asking for. Let's look forward. And I think there's a lot of people kind of taking that
3573920	3581600	approach. So, let's see. They apparently worked with organizations like glad and able gamers to
3581600	3586320	develop these tags. Yes, that's true. Also says, you know what, Rob? I didn't think of that,
3586320	3591360	but I totally get it now. Lego kind of got some of that for the rainbow pride set they announced.
3591360	3596640	Yes. And that's kind of what it is. It's like, okay, cool. Everybody's gay in June. Awesome.
3596640	3601600	How are you the rest of the year? And this is what a lot of marginalized communities, again,
3601600	3606640	I'm not black. I'm not going to in any way try to speak for that community. But a lot of message
3606640	3614080	that I hear from folks is February. Yes, is, you know, Black History Month. But it would be really
3614080	3619920	great if we learned about black people 365 days a year. Like that should be a thing that we learn
3619920	3626400	about in schools and in curriculum. Juneteenth should be a thing that we learn about in schools
3626960	3633120	and not just like, oh, you know, February, right? And that is really be a nationally
3633120	3638720	recognized holiday. It is a very similar discussion when it comes to things like pride
3638720	3643040	is it's like, that's great, you know, and again, it's kind of like one of those I'm sure you have
3643040	3650160	good intentions. But how do you treat how did the policies of your company treat gay people,
3650160	3656000	trans people, and all sorts of marginalized people the rest of the time of the year? That's what this
3656000	3663920	boils down to. So, and deejirama S. responds, Rob, I feel this so hard in February. And
3663920	3669040	Bonsoblo6 says you hit the F a nail on the head, Rob. How are you the rest of the year?
3669840	3675520	Dark Tetsuya says Mishkin says thank you from over on the couch during playing Final Fantasy 14.
3675520	3682400	You're welcome, because I've learned a lot of this from you guys. And you want to go back to
3682400	3688320	20 years of Orange Lounge Radio. And even though I'm aging as faster and so forth, and what is
3688320	3693920	different between episode one and today? I've learned a lot of shit. I've learned a lot of shit.
3693920	3697200	And I think a lot of you guys have too. I think we've all learned from each other.
3697200	3703760	And that's one beautiful thing about all of this. So okay, anyhow, where was I? Oh, yes,
3703760	3711040	I was talking about the Twitch tags. What else do we have? We have I didn't talk. So I've been
3711040	3715600	talking about the trans tag, but it's important to notice. Note, the other tags are going to be
3715600	3722640	related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more.
3723200	3730240	Black, disabled, veteran, VTuber. I'm very sorry to show my ignorance here. I do not know what
3730240	3737280	VTuber virtual Youtubers virtual stream virtual avatar streamers. Oh, okay. I did not know what
3737280	3742960	that meant. Sorry. Okay. And they're going to remove references to Ally from that tag and
3742960	3751040	give allies their own tag as we were talking about before. I am of this mindset. I'm of this mindset
3751040	3756480	that like, if you are streaming on Twitch, you should be an ally in the first place.
3757360	3763600	And like people that aren't should be. And when I say ally, I don't mean just LG. I don't mean,
3763840	3770240	I mean the new flag that also has a decent human being. Yes, like that. And that's always the thing
3770240	3775520	that kind of got me about it is like, like Twitch should just like, if you can't treat people
3775520	3780720	different than you decently, I don't think you should be on this platform. Like, you know, go,
3780720	3785280	go start your own website. You shouldn't be on this one, but that's, I don't know. Maybe folks
3785280	3790240	think I'm a little bit too harsh with that, but I, you don't have to, you don't have to sit there
3790240	3796800	and scream gay rights on your stream. You don't have to do that, but like you can like not say
3796800	3803440	fag on your stream. You can not do that. But Rob, what the whole thing of having an ally tag though
3803440	3813040	has extra meaning for me as an asexual person. Oh, of course. Of course. We are a very overlooked
3813040	3819200	minority in the community. Um, a couple of the, um, the streamers that, you know, I'm pretty much
3819520	3825040	regular in their chats, like, uh, losing color puddings, um, naked prints, a few of them we've
3825040	3831280	actually, it's opened up that conversation in a few of, of those chats about, and there's people
3831280	3837280	in there who legit don't know that the aid does not stand for ally. I totally get it. Yeah. And
3837280	3844800	going in and educating people and having them be receptive to it has been amazing. You're right.
3845280	3851680	And I think I might be talking about a mindset that has existed on Twitch that will get better
3851680	3855840	maybe because of this and because it's going to be separated and so forth. And I would bet
3855840	3861920	I haven't looked, but with 350 tags, I have no choice but to assume a sexuality is going to be
3861920	3869360	a tag. Uh, I really do hope so. I can't confirm that, but yeah, I really do hope that it is if
3869360	3874240	transgender is going to have their own tag us ace folks need one too, or the, you know, the
3874240	3879680	non-binary community, um, tends to be also overlooked too, because people are so stuck in
3879680	3885520	this binary point of view. But, um, I mean, I'm also wondering since they were bringing up, um,
3885520	3891520	religious identity and nationality, if I'm going to see like a Jewish tag or a Muslim tag or
3891520	3897200	something like that, maybe, um, well, I guess we'll see. Uh, I don't know if they've published
3897200	3902800	the list. Um, but we'll find out next week. That's for sure. Peer to peer had Jewish as
3902800	3909040	an identity on there, which of course I put in right away. Um, cause I don't really find many
3909040	3914960	people who are outwardly, you know, public about their, about being Jewish on Twitch.
3915680	3921600	And I think that when you see that, you know, if you look past the stereotypes and see that,
3921760	3926480	we're all just like people that it would remove some of the stigma.
3928160	3933280	Um, uh, what else is it going to say with it? Oh, I was just gonna say, I'm glad that Twitch
3933280	3938480	is doing this. Um, I, I was always kind of like a little bit surprised, like, like I think if I
3938480	3942800	was kind of like in charge of Twitch, like how might I have done this? I might've had ways that
3942800	3949520	you can identify you, the streamer or your community and tags that play into this, you know,
3950400	3955600	honestly, the fact that I'm in my forties. And streaming on Twitch, I think is worthy of a tag
3955600	3959840	of some sort because, you know, we are, there's not a lot of folks in their forties that are
3959840	3963920	streaming on Twitch. There really isn't. I, and I, of course I would like to have a tag so that
3963920	3967680	people know I'm a gay guy that plays games and, and you know, other things that speak to me as
3967680	3972000	well. And I think, um, for like your community and for yourself and that, so you would have
3972000	3975680	tags for that that are kind of like permanent for your, well, not permanent. You can always
3975680	3980560	change them, but they're like account wide, if you will account wide tags. And then the streams
3980560	3988320	that you create have their own tags. So it's like, okay, I am the 40 something gay guy that is doing
3988320	3994880	a hot tub stream today, you know, or whatever it is. Or I am doing a retro stream where I guess,
3994880	3998800	cause hot tub is going to be a category now and people might say, Oh, it's you're talking.
3998800	4003840	Well, okay. No. Um, and today I'm doing a retro stream where you can ask me anything.
4003840	4008320	And, uh, I'm taking audience requests. Cause those are all things that are tags right now.
4008320	4014240	Like, and I, I would like to have separated things that way. You're you're like who you are versus
4014240	4019360	what is in this piece of content that you're making. Do you know where, do you know where
4019360	4025280	that idea is at? And it works pretty well. Pornhub and I'll leave it at that.
4027840	4030880	I've heard surprisingly progressive. I've I've heard.
4031360	4041440	I, I wouldn't know myself. All right. Anyhow. Okay. Uh, let's move on. Um, let's see. Uh,
4041440	4045120	it's my turn. Yes, it is. Sorry. I was just looking at comments in the chat, uh, because,
4045120	4050560	uh, pod culture is like old fart tag as she, 100 Matt says geriatric millennial tag. Sure. Even
4050560	4056160	though technically I'm Gen X. I'll add something about that. Um, and this is, and it's not like
4056160	4061280	a toot my own horn because yeah, I have good genes and take care of myself. But like when
4061280	4068160	I've been streaming, I'll legit have people who are surprised that I'm 45, but I take care of
4068160	4077280	myself and you know, I think that people are staying younger longer because we're realizing
4077280	4085040	that that attitude is, it's something that society has put on us that you have these expectations of
4085040	4090240	you. And I think our generation is one of the first ones to break from it, you know? Yeah.
4091200	4099200	And so, um, like I all the time, you know, we'll get, um, oh, well you can't have remembered that
4099200	4103520	or on the phone with my job, you know, I'll be like, oh yeah, my first computer was a Coleco
4103520	4112960	Adam. Like you can't, you can't have had that. Was it like third hand? I'm like, no, you know,
4112960	4117920	but I think that this is the thing that, you know, I'm not so sure that I'm down for the age
4117920	4125520	tag on there just because I don't really think it's relevant anymore except for the, the mental
4125520	4130880	aspect of it, their perspective that you give, I suppose. Um, and again, tags are always an opt
4130880	4134480	in thing, you know, just cause they have the tag doesn't mean you have to, you know, and there's
4134480	4139040	some, there are some folks within the trans community that would not like to use those tags
4139040	4144240	and that is completely a person's choice. Some people feel that if they use the tag,
4144240	4149680	they're going to be opening themselves to, um, people coming in to abuse the channel and be,
4149680	4155040	be shits online. Basically I completely get that. And if somebody doesn't want to use it for that
4155040	4162160	reason, um, I a hundred percent, 150% support it. Like you, I get it. However, I am also glad,
4162160	4167920	sorry, Jamie. I'm also very glad that Twitch said as a part of this statement, we understand,
4167920	4170960	and I don't have the exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, sorry, but basically like,
4170960	4176000	we understand the concern that these tags could open up channels to abuse and we want to make
4176000	4180800	clear this abuse is not acceptable on our platform and they are bannable offenses. That was my,
4181520	4186640	honestly, that part was the best part about this whole announcement to me is that they have made
4186640	4194080	it very clear. Harassment has no place on this platform. Good. It shouldn't. Sorry, Jamie. I cut
4194080	4198640	you off while I was ranting. I was just saying, you know, with the, the using the tags like that,
4198640	4205280	like me, I mean, technically as a demigirl, I have been told that I fall under the trans group,
4206240	4214480	but I don't use it because I don't, I just don't feel like it's representative of me. I'm
4215200	4219840	borderline, you know, it's, it's, it's so weird. And that is a hundred percent your call to make.
4220640	4226480	Exactly. Nobody makes that call but you. Exactly. Exactly. So, all right. So anyway,
4226480	4231200	um, I was using it as an example. I'm very curious to see what happens to some of these
4231200	4235680	other websites. Like the, um, I'm sorry, I forget. Is it the peer to peer? Was that the name of it?
4235680	4241200	The peer to peer? Yeah. That's the one that, uh, that I got accepted on. I'm kind of curious where,
4241200	4246400	where now that these tags are happening, does a site like that still kind of stick around for
4246400	4250320	the community they've built or are they going to evolve in some way? I'm just kind of curious.
4250320	4256640	Like, I think it's still necessary and I'll tell you why. Um, and actually when I was streaming
4256640	4262400	last week and I actually kind of fussed at them because I thought it was a bot. Um, but actually
4262400	4268880	they have people who work with peer to peer who are going in to channels and doing promotion for
4268880	4274080	those channels for different people in the peer to peer network. Oh, like this one was like called
4274080	4279840	like businessman something. And, and I was like, Oh, somebody blocked this. Like, no, no, I'm only
4279840	4284480	half a bot. I'm actually really a person here, but, and so we, we talked about it and they're
4284480	4290000	like, yeah, we're promoting people who are on peer to peer so that, um, we can, you know,
4290000	4294080	build up more of that acceptance and make sure that these people are given more of a voice.
4294080	4298080	And I was like, Oh, well, well fine. Hang around. I'm cool with that. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.
4298640	4305760	You know, okay. So like the literal sense of network that makes perfect sense and
4305760	4309920	clearly answers my question, how that is still totally relevant. Thank you.
4309920	4314560	I found new streamers through peer to peer, just, you know, I've found games that I've,
4314560	4319360	you know, haven't heard of from watching peer to peer. Um, I've, I've really,
4320960	4325280	I've really been enjoying the service and I'm honestly proud to be a part of it.
4325280	4329040	Neat. No, that's great. And thank you for, um, explaining that because now that you put it in
4329040	4333600	that light where it's like literally not just about like being on a directory, but the active
4333600	4338560	promotion of people that also agree to those, you know, rules that identify in these different ways
4338560	4342400	that are also on the directory. It's about that mutual promotion and benefit. Um, Oh yes,
4342400	4347920	I a hundred percent get that. Hello, VOG network. We, we kind of have, we're, we're a form of that
4347920	4352960	for like a different thing, like indie voices and stuff. Right. So like when you put it in that,
4352960	4357360	uh, context, I'm like, Oh, okay. Oh, I guess so. It's like, it's like VOG, but this thing,
4357360	4361600	cool, neat. Well, and we may have some new VOG additions down the line, just saying,
4361600	4367280	well, we're still open to, you know, especially folks that want to do the Twitch thing. I mean,
4367280	4371360	yes, we have room for podcasters as well. Uh, and we have great shows that have been on our network
4371360	4375520	a long, long time that still do the audio only thing like British invaders. If you have never
4375520	4379840	heard me talk about them, they are a wonderful show that talk about British television and you
4379840	4384320	will find out about so many neat shows. You need to dig out of an archive and watch, uh,
4384320	4390320	that just like how we got from, you know, uh, old, uh, older shows in the fifties and sixties
4390320	4394240	to now and somewhere it's, it's great. Um, and then we have, of course, shows that are on video,
4394240	4400240	like us, Bobby anime jam session. Um, so yeah, my point was, um, we're always, you know, I've,
4400240	4405440	I've admittedly been very sleeping on a lot of this during the pandemic and some folks have even
4405440	4410400	reached out to me and I've just been kind of like, this whole thing has just been a lot.
4410400	4416080	And like, honestly, status quo right now is an achievement. If I can be perfectly honest
4416080	4420400	throughout this pandemic status quo has been an achievement, but now that we're getting to the
4420400	4427760	other side of things, I I'm definitely need to go back on the motivation side of things. So,
4427760	4433680	all right. Yeah. All right. Dark soccer. We've been teasing this next story, the entire show.
4433680	4442160	So let's talk about it. All right. So, um, I, um, I have incentive to play no man's sky,
4442160	4446000	which for the record, it's not going to run on my back. I have to see if I can run it in my
4446000	4453120	virtualizer. Um, but at any rate, um, there's a crossover with no man's sky from mass effect.
4453120	4460480	And this lasts until the 31st. So time is indeed of the essence. Um, but basically you can do a,
4461040	4471760	uh, a mission that will let you, I guess, build the Normandy kind of, uh, acquire. Yes. You
4471760	4477360	basically call it, you, you call it the, as you play it, it, um, hints that there is like
4477360	4482320	something and there's very subtle hints through the whole thing where it's like, um, uh, something
4482320	4486800	that is called to action when it is most desperately needed. And as like mixed up with
4486800	4491280	radio interference and it says two worlds colliding coming together. So it's like hinting
4491280	4495120	that it's a crossover. And then when you finally finished the last thing and you put this beacon
4495120	4499440	out, it actually, it kind of like summons the Normandy into the orbit of the planet that you're
4499440	4504320	on. And you can go claim it for your own, um, your fleet. Would this be something I can do
4504320	4509840	as a new player? Yes, because they've put it in a new mode called expeditions, which is the mode.
4509840	4514560	That's kind of like Diablo seasons where you start a new game. It's the only way you can do it. You
4514560	4520240	start a new game, uh, in expeditions mode and expeditions mode sets you up with certain stuff
4520240	4527600	to begin with. So, um, and another hint, the very first thing that you do in this is you build a car
4527600	4533040	that looks a lot like the Mako. It's the very first thing you do, uh, and you drive to where
4533040	4537680	your ship is at basically. How long did it take you to do about five hours of gameplay?
4538480	4543120	So keep that in mind too. You're in, you do have to put in the time. Um, you're not going to be
4543120	4550800	able to just go in there and, uh. So I could get it done tonight after my stream. Yeah. So, um,
4550800	4556400	as long as I'm not, I'm actually right now seeing if I can put it on my, uh, on my windows desktop,
4556400	4567200	my virtual desktop. So, um, but, uh, let's hear it for gigabit ethernet, but, but anyway, um, it's,
4567200	4572080	it's, it looks like it's really cool. Um, now I guess I probably should have just had you do this
4572080	4577440	story, Rob, because you've actually done this, but, um, like do you get to go inside the Normandy?
4577440	4582480	Is it the same? No. So, and I think they did this purposely because they knew that people would want
4582480	4586080	to go inside it and do all this stuff. And I don't think no man's sky engine is really built
4586080	4591440	for that. You can't use it as your own ship because the ships in no man's sky are very
4591440	4597280	individualistic. They're tiny little flying pods, um, to suddenly have the Normandy and all of its
4597280	4601040	crew and all that stuff doesn't really gel with the lore. So what they did is they made the
4601040	4607360	Normandy a fleet ship and fleets go with your, uh, frigates and the missions that you send those
4607360	4612160	out on, uh, you acquire different fleet ships to send out emissions. So Normandy is basically
4612160	4617120	becomes like a, an agent that you send out to do separate missions and, and come back and bring
4617120	4622320	you stuff. But it is like, it's an S class. It's the very best type that you don't see, uh, every
4622320	4628800	day. So that's interesting. Yeah. Um, also, and it's also worth pointing out because a lot of the,
4628800	4634160	the tweet focused on the ship and everything, you actually unlock other stuff. So as you're doing
4634160	4638720	the missions and you know, you, you make your way, you start to see more and more of what you get.
4638720	4644640	And when you finish it all, you get titles, you get paragon, the paragon and the renegade. So
4644640	4650880	you unlock those titles. You actually get a sticker, uh, or like a, uh, uh, I forget what
4650880	4656240	they call them. Um, a logo, a splash, I don't know, but you get that, that you could put on
4656240	4663920	your base. So you get it and it just looks like the Normandy and you also get, um, something else
4663920	4669040	along those lines too, where it's like a art thing of the Normandy that you actually pick up and you
4669040	4675120	can use on your base. Now, are you stuck using this in your seasonal file? Because the expeditions
4675120	4680640	turn to regular games at the end of the expedition. Uh, and the answer is no, you're not limited to it.
4680640	4686880	So once you claim that, or once you've finished your season stuff, you can go back in your main
4686880	4692560	game and you're going to summon the space anomaly. That's the hub that you're able to summon a little
4692560	4697040	ways into the story in the main game, in the season game, you can get it right from the start.
4697040	4702480	Um, but you summon the space anomaly and in there is a vendor and he's the same one that had the
4702480	4707680	Twitch rewards from all those things during the first expedition. And you can, you talk to him and
4707680	4712880	he now has an expedition reward category and you can just pop the Normandy into your fleet from
4712880	4717280	there. Get your sticker, get your titles, get all that stuff that it gives you right off the bat.
4717280	4723440	That's pretty cool. Yeah. Well, um, well I'm going to see if it'll run in my virtualizer. Um,
4724240	4731120	but, uh, if not, I guess that's what my steam link is going to be for, for my, uh, my PC that I'm
4731120	4736240	still looking at with slight loathing because of how often it would just restart.
4737200	4742320	Bobby Black Wolf asks a great question in chat that I honestly don't know the answer to. And
4742320	4749120	that is, do we know if this goes cross platform, if you linked all your accounts? I don't know.
4749840	4755600	But if I remember after the show and you may need to nudge me with a tweet, I will log into my steam
4755600	4760960	account and check out my no man's sky file there. I think I can get the space anomaly in my steam
4760960	4765440	account. If not, I'll just fucking play it again until I can. And I'll answer that question. So
4765600	4771200	I'll try to do it, um, because I actually don't know. Um, and that's a great question. And I
4771200	4775760	doubt anyone listening currently is crazy enough to own that game on multiple platforms like I do,
4775760	4781600	although I did not buy the Xbox one. I'm using game pass to do it. I only have it on steam,
4781600	4786000	but, uh, I think it is a great question that you're asking. So, um, I will try to remember
4786000	4790000	to do that after the show, but you may need to nudge me if I don't respond because I forget
4790000	4795840	things. So, all right. But yeah, it's an awesome collaborate. So it's so random, but I just,
4795840	4799760	it's so short. I wish, I wish they would have given at least till mid June. I get that it
4799760	4804000	doesn't take as long to finish, but I think you have a lot of people that haven't been interested
4804000	4808960	in no man's sky that are suddenly like, Oh, I want to fly up and around. Cause the nice thing is
4808960	4814720	dark soccer. And this is right up your alley. When the Normandy is just floating there in space,
4814720	4820480	you can take your ship and you can fly all around it and underneath it and up close and over. You
4820480	4825680	can just like, you know, look at the Normandy from any direction you want. So that's awesome.
4825680	4832640	Yeah, it really is. I love, I love the Normandy. Yeah, me too. All right. Um, let's move on
4832640	4838000	Loki. Something, something exciting in your world and your fandoms, right? Uh, yeah, absolutely. So
4838000	4844800	deep silver. Um, I mean, there's been rumors that there's a new time splitters game being worked on
4844800	4849840	for a long time. In fact, there's been several iterations with different companies that happening,
4849840	4855760	but now we've got something official actually coming. Um, thanks to deep silver. So deep
4855760	4863120	silver put out a tweet, um, announcing that deep silver studio is coming, uh, free radical design.
4863120	4867760	So our new deep silver studio. And so they're bringing back free radical design, which actually
4868720	4874640	back in 2014, but they're bringing back the original like veterans, Steve Ellis and David
4874640	4880000	doke. And basically said, you've asked, we listen, we've been working on plans of bringing time
4880000	4885440	splitters franchise back to life and are pleased to let you know that we are doing just that,
4885440	4890400	uh, free radical designs is reforming and we'll be headed up by the industry and, uh,
4890400	4896480	time splitters veterans. Uh, this is exciting first step in the process. So I am super excited
4896480	4903840	about that. That is amazing. So I can't wait for a new time splitters game. I just, I hope they do
4903840	4908240	it justice for you, Loki. Cause sometimes they get the gang back together and it's like, Oh,
4908960	4914240	you know, there's not much to the formula really. I mean, it's a, it's an FPS with like weird quirky
4914240	4919840	stuff in it. And I think it, I think that's a pretty easy bar to hit. I just think about,
4919840	4923760	I think about things like mighty number nine and I know that game had its fans and you know,
4923760	4927200	I don't, I don't, but yeah, you see that that was my reaction to Loki.
4928160	4933120	No, I can, I see them being able to do it, especially if you have the original developers
4933120	4939040	on and stuff. I think it'd be fine. All right. Uh, orange right in chat says, I remember spending
4939040	4944080	some time in time splitters, one level editor, uh, as Joe and her to Matt says, we've been teased a
4944080	4948240	new time splitters game for awhile. I hope they pull it off. Yeah. I think that would be fun.
4948240	4952720	Uh, now that they've got it. Well, cause before like that was with like, we've had like kind of
4952720	4959520	work in progress things that were being made by either fans or being made by studios that have
4959520	4966240	clone or closed down and stuff like that. So now that they have a publisher, they have a studio,
4967200	4972640	I think we're, and they've said, yes, we're making it. Um, it's a pretty good indicator that
4972640	4979440	it's coming. Yeah. All right. Um, well, let's move on. Uh, it'll probably be too soon to see
4979440	4983680	details on the time splitter game this summer. Um, but we know we're going to be getting a lot
4983680	4988240	of game announcements, uh, as we get closer to summer, of course, E3 is on the horizon
4988240	4992800	and there are other virtual events that are happening as well, including summer game Fest
4992800	4998240	is coming back this year. And we knew that for some time now, summer game Fest last year,
4998240	5002080	I think people were kind of happy it was there, but it was also kind of hard to follow because
5002080	5006560	summer game Fest was like four months long. Remember that like, it was like summer game Fest
5006560	5010800	is running from June to September. And it was like, that isn't really a Fest, right? Well,
5010800	5014960	it does seem like Jeff Keeley, who of course is the brains behind all of this. You know him from
5014960	5019280	his game awards show and all that. It does seem he's picked up on a lot of that feedback because
5019280	5022960	he he's kind of saying in some tweets that he put out this week, the basically like,
5022960	5028960	I get the feedback that people like to have this information dump kind of like at one time. And
5028960	5034000	that, you know, uh, it's, it's going to be like a memorable month. He says, you know, this will be
5034000	5038640	a memorable month of announcements and updates. So what summer game Fest is going to be, they're
5038640	5043200	going to have a kickoff. They're calling it kickoff live. They're not saying what they're
5043200	5047920	kicking off, but it's kind of like a wink and a nod. It's an E3 kickoff, but not officially
5047920	5054400	because E3 soccer games. Yeah, no, not that kind of get off, but E3 is doing a kickoff. Oops. Nope.
5054400	5059520	No, they're not. As summer game Fest is doing a kickoff that may or may not be inspired by E3,
5060000	5066080	Thursday, June 10th. And it's at 11 AM Pacific time, which, so Bobby was talking before the show,
5066080	5072080	Oh, we might co-stream this. Hey, go, go for it if you're able to, but I will unfortunately be
5072080	5077280	busy with my day job. And that is not the greatest time for that. But I, but I also understand it's
5077280	5083680	in line with a lot of the E3 stuff, which tends to be during the day as well. 30 publishers are
5083680	5089520	taking place, or excuse me, we're taking part in summer game Fest. Some that are not with E3,
5089520	5095600	including PlayStation, Blizzard, Devolver Digital. So maybe we'll get more on that game. You were
5095600	5100720	just talking about it. Electronic Arts, who's doing their EA play live thing still. So that's
5100720	5105520	kind of cool. Also, I don't know why, but Weezer is performing at the kickoff. Well, that's fun.
5105520	5113120	I mean, Weezer's cool. Of course I look at the promo photo of Weezer and I go, Oh shit,
5113120	5124480	they got old. Oh shit. So did I. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. But sorry, I'm not being shady. I promise
5124480	5131280	Weezer's awesome. I'm just, you know, like, Oh shit, they got old. So did I. Apparently also
5131280	5135040	Jeff Keeley loves to do the co-stream stuff and allow that stuff, which I'm very thankful for.
5135040	5139200	And I think that's a great way to do it. You're allowed to co-stream. Apparently you can even
5139200	5142960	co-stream the musical performance because it's a live performance. So it shouldn't hit any of
5142960	5148960	those, whatever, but it has the rights to do all that. It shouldn't. It's true. It's true.
5148960	5156320	But it probably will. All right. So that'll be cool. I can't wait to, I mean, I can't co-stream
5156320	5162240	it, but I can work on a project while I have my earbuds in listening to it. I can do that.
5162240	5168240	So that'll be cool. And I, so I look forward to listening to it when, when it all goes down on
5168240	5176400	June 10th. So let's see. RHM087 in chat says, will the Twitch stream have to have generic rock?
5177680	5182400	Well, that depends on what you consider Weezer. When I read that comment at first,
5182400	5186080	I thought it said geriatric rock and I was like, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
5186080	5192160	It's not the Rolling Stones. Okay. It's not, it's not ACDC. Okay. It's,
5192400	5198400	and I'm sorry if you love those bands. They're great bands, but if Weezer got old,
5199600	5206560	have you seen Aerosmith lately? Like, really? All right. He's melted a bit.
5208320	5214480	All right. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, I was on mute. I was gonna say,
5214480	5217360	look at the Rolling Stones. Keith Richards has to recycle his blood.
5218240	5226080	Oh, yeah. Right. Oh my gosh. And ACDEF says, I think RHM087 is talking about what happened
5226080	5231200	with Metallica at BlizzCon. You're right. I do remember that, how they replaced it with generic
5231200	5237760	rock. But let's remember, Metallica was at the forefront of screwing online music distribution.
5237760	5242720	I realized they've come a long way, but that is a flag they're going to have to carry for
5242720	5247280	forever, basically, what they did to Napster back in the day. You can't help but think about that.
5249600	5257280	I am confident enough that Jeff Keighley has thought of these sorts of questions
5257280	5262320	because he keeps tabs on things like when the Blizzard stream got muted and changed to the
5262320	5267360	generic rock. Like, Jeff Keighley, so I have confidence he's gotten all the contracts and
5267440	5273760	things that need to happen so that your Weezer songs don't get your stream a copyright strike,
5273760	5276320	which is great. There's a reason I make my own music.
5277360	5281040	Yeah, I know. And that's been a great thing, too, is that like copyright strike myself.
5282240	5288640	All right, let's move on. Funny they said that, but that's actually a legitimate strategy to get
5288640	5296160	past some of those copyright strikes in YouTube is a copyright strike yourself. That's so weird.
5296160	5300560	All right, let's move on. Dar soccer. You have a very interesting story here.
5301440	5307600	Yeah. So and this is kind of an important thing for me as someone who plays on things like stadia.
5309360	5317520	But Netflix, honestly, is now looking for an executive. This is a report to head an expansion
5317520	5324720	into video games. The report says that they've reached out to multiple veteran video game
5324720	5329600	industry executives for the position. And this is kind of going along with what some other
5329600	5335040	companies did. Like Apple Arcade came out with a bundle of games and then has been pretty consistent
5335040	5341440	with its updates. And, you know, we have stadia. We have Geforce Now. We've got those different
5341440	5345120	things. So it stands to reason that Netflix is going to want to get in on that action.
5345120	5350240	And I'm pretty sure they can make it profitable. And on top of that, you know, they've also
5350720	5358080	did interactive video stuff like the Black Mirror Bandersnatch and the Kimmy Schmidt episode.
5358960	5365360	And then they've also done series based off of video game properties. I mean, we had Castlevania.
5365360	5370960	We had The Witcher. But and they've also produced games. There were the Stranger Things games,
5370960	5374720	which, of course, they also licensed out Stranger Things to behavior for Dead by Daylight.
5375360	5380000	And the other thing, though, that's going on is that since Netflix subscriptions have slowed
5380000	5388480	down because of their production delays, that they've gone out and said in 2019 that their
5388480	5398480	biggest competition was Fortnite. So they're there. The fact that they would want to expand
5398480	5407920	into these other fields, especially for video game streaming, it really makes sense to me.
5407920	5412800	I think it would be a wise move on their part, although they've got other established
5413920	5417120	outlets, you know, that are already going to be a step ahead of them.
5418000	5422800	You know, it's interesting. You know, I know we're talking about kind of like literal games here that
5422800	5427280	Netflix might build into their game. But, you know, it's interesting. You know,
5427280	5430320	that Netflix might build in, you know, like literal games. And it would be interesting
5430320	5434240	to see how that's all delivered if it's through their app or how they how they get the game stuff
5434240	5439360	on all the televisions and stuff they support. But it's possible, probably with a very, you know,
5439360	5444640	like an Android, you know, type of base for all the games, it would probably work. But kind of
5444640	5448560	something you said there at the end made me think about like actual like video game streaming
5448560	5452960	content. And we talk a lot about how Twitch is really out here unopposed. I mean, yes,
5452960	5460080	there's YouTube, but there's another one that went different. Yeah. Mixer that used to be
5460080	5466160	Beam back in the day. So, you know, wouldn't it be interesting if somebody like Netflix tried to
5466160	5471680	do like a Twitch thing, like maybe not necessarily letting anybody create content, although I'm all
5471680	5475840	about that. And I hope that is the direction a company that would choose to do that would do.
5475840	5481200	But what if a company like Netflix tried to woo some of these big game streamers with large
5481200	5487920	audiences to create content for Netflix? That would be wild. It would be like a ninja type
5487920	5491840	thing that's on Netflix. I hate to invoke him because he's always the person that people talk
5491840	5497600	about. But there's a reason for that. You know, his streams are huge. So it'll be interesting.
5498320	5504400	So it would. Yeah. But our HM 087 in chats is right now for me, Netflix's biggest competition
5504400	5510160	is YouTube. And there is that is because you and YouTube is basically free. You know, the ads.
5510560	5518000	I have a paid YouTube premium account. Yeah, I think there's a thing with Google phones,
5518000	5522160	too, where that like because I think Alan has like a premium account that he gets because he
5522160	5526960	has an Android phone of some type. So I don't know how that works. But yeah, yeah, it's interesting.
5526960	5533040	So. All right. Well, on top of that, now, I think that for Twitch streamers,
5533840	5539360	I think once you make partner, you are allowed to stream to YouTube as well.
5540320	5547440	Really? I don't know. I was reading something about doing multiple streaming. I mean, I only I
5547440	5550720	don't plan on doing any YouTube streaming. It's just the thing is, is that with Stadia,
5550720	5555040	it has an automatic ability to stream to your YouTube account if you want to.
5555040	5558240	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a big thing they were selling in the beginning. Yeah.
5558240	5562720	Yeah, which I don't want to do. Yeah. Interesting. All right. Well,
5562720	5569760	let's move on, Loki. You're muted, by the way, Loki, we can't hear you, so.
5569760	5576240	Sorry, kids are yelling. So this is pretty cool. We had a mod that's been made for Red Dead
5576240	5584480	Redemption 2 to add VR support in the sense that they add basically a point of view with VR.
5584480	5588560	They're still working out the controls and everything, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is a
5588560	5593200	pretty gorgeous looking game as it is. So it makes for a very immersive experience.
5594160	5598960	So this is coming actually by the guy that did the same thing, Luke Ross. He did the same thing
5598960	5605600	for Grand Theft Auto five. And right now you can only run it on really high end hardware.
5605600	5612160	They're saying that he's basically tested it on just the top of the line, you know,
5612160	5619520	RTX 3080s and stuff. And it's still kind of not smooth yet, but it's still being worked on.
5621040	5628400	But man, it looks pretty awesome. Like, I don't know that I would love to try that out someday,
5628400	5634480	but I don't have the hardware to run that. So I always think it's weird. I always think it's
5634480	5638960	weird when they inject VR into things that weren't really built for VR. But I also think like,
5639760	5643600	let's say a game like No Man's Sky where the developers admittedly were the ones that kind
5643600	5647600	of built that. They kind of made the game work well for it. I think No Man's Sky is a pleasant
5647600	5651440	experience in VR. I wouldn't want to play the game 24 seven in that way or like all the time,
5651440	5654000	but I thought when I did play it, I was like, damn, this looks good.
5654640	5659200	It's been a long time since I played Red Dead Redemption 2, but I know like with Grand Theft
5659200	5663040	Auto 5, they had the first person view that you could do. I can't remember if they had something
5663040	5667840	similar that I am in Red Dead Redemption. If that's the case, then it'd be very easy to adapt
5667840	5674960	it to VR because you already have like that kind of same camera already set up. Maybe they do. I
5674960	5681600	can't remember because it's been, gosh, like over a year since I played the game. But yeah, I mean,
5681600	5688560	it looks pretty, pretty awesome. So yeah, hopefully it'll be developed a little bit,
5688560	5693120	you know, they'll work out the kinks with it and it'll be playable on something that's not so
5693120	5698320	screaming cutting edge right now, or, well, just wait a little bit longer and eventually it'll be,
5699840	5703760	you know, that won't be cutting edge anymore. So we'll have to wait and see.
5703760	5706960	Something you're unable to acquire because of fucking scalpers, right?
5706960	5713680	So, uh, well, right. And that, and the fact that I use a laptop, so I can't update that
5713680	5718640	thing anyways. I got to buy a new one. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, moving on,
5719120	5724480	we have a story that talks about the Evercade system, which, uh, I think, uh, this is cute.
5724480	5729200	I kind of want one. Like we, we, uh, brought it up before and I'm kind of like, oh, it's another
5729200	5733440	kind of retro thing. There's these, there's a lot of these out there. This is the one I was telling
5733440	5737360	you. Well, we, we talked about it a little bit before, but this is the one also that had, um,
5737360	5742080	some nest maker games on there. So they have several, uh, guys in the community that made
5742080	5746800	games, have their games published on this, which is awesome. That is I'm open. Hey, you want to
5746800	5753200	approach somebody? I got a phone. I'm waiting for it to ring. Well, um, right now, Loki,
5753200	5757120	they're a little busy because they're going to be doing some, uh, some, uh, not, not Indy,
5757120	5761760	but some other, uh, big publishers of the past, uh, doing some, uh, compilations there.
5761760	5767840	They're gonna, um, be released on November 3rd, pre-order start May 28th. Uh, they're going to
5767840	5774080	cost 20 bucks, uh, or a 15 euros, if you will, uh, they are compilation cartridges, which include
5774080	5781760	Atari arcade one, uh, which has things like Pong warlords lunar Lander asteroids data East, uh,
5781760	5789200	which has bad dudes versus dragon Ninja burger time, uh, lock and chase chase, uh, chain reaction.
5789200	5795840	Um, Jaleco arcade with, uh, alligator hunt, snowboard championship, world rally, and then
5795840	5801440	technos arcade, which has, uh, the combat tribes, uh, double dragon two and three. Um,
5802720	5808000	Dr. John's adventure. Oh, mysterious stones, uh, minke monkey. Some games I haven't even honestly
5808000	5813040	heard of to be real, but I love the idea of like these like super retro games in cartridges so
5813040	5817120	that you're not like accumulating all these little mini players that play like five games. You have
5817120	5821840	one mini player and a cartridges. That's kind of cool. It's like a legit way to do it. So that's,
5821920	5827280	that's neat. Um, I, I, I'm kind of interested in one of these things and I haven't been for a long
5827280	5832560	time, so well, remember they also have the full, uh, console version of this that's coming out.
5832560	5836640	That's going to play. They have two cartridge slots though. For example, if you wanted to
5836640	5841440	load up data East and you know, Atari or something like that, you can pop them both in and you have
5841440	5846560	all those games you can choose from on there. Um, so you can just have a larger library and
5846560	5850640	swap them out as you need to, but they also have the handheld version as well. It's available.
5850640	5856960	Yeah. All right. Well, let's take a trip back down memory lane. It was a simpler to, Oh my gosh.
5856960	5861360	Uh, I may have ruined it, but, um, well, you'll see it was the classic game of the week. Cause
5861360	5865280	I hit the wrong button that actually showed the game. So maybe you recognize it, but if you didn't
5865280	5869520	dark soccer is here to educate you on it. And I bet a lot of people didn't recognize that game.
5869520	5873520	Cause this is, this is one that's for me, I, at least for me is a little bit more of a deep cut.
5873520	5877920	I wouldn't have recognized it off that half a second clip. I just leaked through there.
5878080	5881760	But dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,
5881760	5885680	you guys should be checking this game out. Uh, dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5888640	5891760	You're muted just FYI. I, I can't see your camera, but.
5892640	5897600	Okay. Oh, there you are. Um, the game, the game is arrow fighters, um, which is also known as
5897600	5903840	Sonic wings in Japan. It's a vertically scrolling shooter that came out in arcades. Um, in 1992,
5904400	5911200	it was released by video system and it got ported over to the super Famicom in 1993.
5911200	5917120	It was the first in this series, also a spiritual successor to a 1991 game called turbo force.
5918080	5922560	It's a basic shooter. Um, you know, you have your normal weapons, you can upgrade your
5922560	5931440	weapons with, uh, P items or rarer F items. Um, and then, uh, of course your maximum power level
5931520	5937600	does have a hidden ammo count. Um, which of course, uh, after you use that up,
5937600	5944480	you'll be reduced back to your previous power level. Uh, button two has a special attack. Um,
5945520	5953200	and, uh, it really, the thing that made this a little bit more famous is that it had a cast
5953200	5960080	of characters, which in 1992, wasn't really something that happened regularly in a shooting
5960080	5970080	game. So, um, it had, uh, from the United States, its character was called blaster Keaton. Um,
5970080	5977280	then player two was Keith Bishop. Um, then in Japan you had Hien and then Mao Mao for player two
5978000	5984880	Sweden, you had Kofl, the Viking, and then TB 10. And then for UK, you had
5984960	5992480	William Sid pride and Lord river and white and white. So yeah, you had your own characters,
5992480	5999040	each of them with their own special, uh, special plane. Um, well, of course, you know that the,
5999040	6004480	the two us ones, one was an FA 18 Hornet and the other was an F 14 Tomcat. Cause I mean,
6004480	6013120	hello. Um, but anyway, um, this was considered, um, according to game machine in Japan, uh,
6013120	6018480	the second most successful table arcade unit of the year. And it was the second most popular
6018480	6026400	arcade game at the time. Um, it did come out on the SNES, as I mentioned, GamePro gave it a pretty
6026400	6032160	negative review because it slowed down, uh, had slowed down issues in mediocre graphics and some,
6032160	6038800	uh, sound effects issues. The music in it wasn't super great. Um, it did also get an emulated
6038800	6046320	version in 2005 for PS2 for a, uh, Japan exclusive Oritachi Gessen Zoku series. Um,
6046320	6057280	it had a number of sequels that came out. Um, so, uh, uh, it looks like that, um, the main,
6057280	6065040	uh, designer Nakamura Shin, uh, did not like that they wanted to, uh, develop for Neo Geo
6065600	6070960	and wanted to make more vertical games like that. Um, but couldn't do it for a horizontal monitor.
6070960	6078640	So he formed, uh, Saikyo P S I K Y O, um, and did samurai ACEs for their first game.
6078640	6085840	Anybody's heard of that. So, um, at video system, however, uh, they did Aero Fighters 2,
6085840	6090880	Aero Fighters 3, both came out on Neo Geo. Sonic Wing Special, which was like a dream
6090960	6096160	match version was recent Sega Saturn implementation. Special was also reaped,
6096160	6104320	uh, into arcades as Sonic Wings Limited. And then, um, uh, Paradigm Entertainment developed
6104320	6110800	Aero Fighters Assault for video system. Um, and so, uh, of course, Sonic Wings Special and Limited
6110800	6117840	were both vertical monitor games. Um, Nakamura, um, who I mentioned earlier went on for Strikers
6117840	6129920	1945 Plus for Neo Geo. Um, so, uh, a popular culture thing is that, uh, John Green, um,
6129920	6137280	you know, who we know from mental floss, uh, and all that, um, in the Savannah airport mistakenly
6137280	6148160	read it as nerdfighters. Um, and so they, uh, they had nerdfighters and nerdfighteria as a
6148160	6152480	collective title for him and his brother's fan community. So I thought it was kind of funny.
6152480	6159760	And then in 2013, uh, he was given an Aero Fighters arcade cabinet as a gift. Um, so the reason why
6159760	6169280	I am bringing this up is that the, um, the SNES copy of this can go for some bucks. Um,
6170400	6178240	on eBay on average for a boxed copy, I'm sorry, this one's an unboxed copy that has even been
6178240	6185440	scratched in on it is going for 1200. I think I have this game though. I really do. I have to
6185440	6193920	check. There's another one for 1700. Um, that is again, just, uh, just the cartridge. Um,
6194480	6201120	I haven't seen what one in the box goes for. I'm pretty sure I own this game and it does look like
6201120	6210000	there is now I am seeing one on another site though, that says new in the box,
6210000	6219760	US version retail for 40 bucks. So I don't know if it's like a legit one, but who knows,
6220720	6228960	but at any rate, um, you know, good luck. It is, uh, yeah, I don't know if this is legit. It
6228960	6233760	doesn't, it looks a little bit too clean to be legit. So I'd have to double check, but yeah,
6233760	6242000	it is. Um, it's a game that's kind of hard to find. Wow. There you go. Yeah. I'm pretty sure
6242000	6247040	this is a repro. All right. Well, is that it? That's the classic game of the week. That's
6247040	6250240	the classic game of the week. I didn't have a lot to say about it, but I brought it up,
6250240	6257600	um, as one that for some reason it's going for money. Yeah. Boy. Oh boy. Yeah. And you're going
6257600	6260960	to have a lot of people checking their collections at home going, do I still have a cartridge?
6260960	6264640	Cause some folks recognized it in chat. Uh, not, not just from the starting screen,
6264640	6267840	but once you were talking a little more about it and we actually saw the gameplay, it was like,
6267840	6271840	oh yeah, there's, I've played this. So, um, that would be interesting if any of our listeners
6271840	6276800	happen to have this little gold mine sitting in their house. So good pick. Thank you. Thank you.
6277360	6283520	All right. Classic game of the week. All right. Oh, I see that. Uh, Stella decided to join us.
6283520	6288960	Loki's cat for those listening on the podcast picture. Uh, but Stella's decided to join us
6288960	6294160	there during the break. Oh, she looks so comfortable. I love it. I hate it. She's
6294160	6304080	either comfortable or screaming. She has two moods. All right. Uh, well, I hate resting
6304080	6310000	and possum. I hate to make you move. Loki cause Stella looks perfectly comfortable,
6310000	6315920	but, uh, it's time for rapid fire news. All right. So as we were just talking about,
6315920	6322560	um, red dead redemption two, it should be no surprise that we're getting granted thought of
6322560	6329680	five on the Xbox series X and PlayStation five, three generations of consoles in the same stupid
6329680	6335200	game. Um, I love grant the thought of five, but dude, come on. Like, and this is not coming out
6335200	6341280	until November 11th. So that's, that's a long ways away. Like, can we please get something new,
6341840	6346320	please? I don't really want to play grand theft auto online. I just want
6347120	6352480	grand theft auto six, please. Can I have that please? Somebody put an interesting timeline
6352480	6358480	out that really shows that like rock star hasn't done that much in the past few years.
6358480	6361840	They're making so much money off of grant the federal online. I guess so.
6362400	6368000	Yeah. It's crazy. Games, games take longer to make, especially huge AAA titles with 4k graphics
6368000	6371680	and stuff. They're going to take longer to make. And I understand that. But when you like,
6371680	6375440	really see like what the weight is like now versus what it used to be, it's like,
6375440	6381200	where is grand auto six, but, but, but, uh, with that grant, that thought of five,
6381840	6388720	I want to say came out. Um, well, it was, it's been several years. Um,
6389760	6395680	was that 2015? No, that wasn't 25th, 2013. Yeah. It's been a while. It's been,
6395680	6403440	it will be eight years in September. So I think that's enough time to develop a grand
6403440	6407040	theft auto game considering that this one didn't take as long. Granted, they have gone through
6407040	6412960	multiple systems, but I just think that they're making so much money on credit auto online that
6412960	6418400	they just aren't really motivated to make another game. So, so if we're going to get a games that
6418400	6423520	just won't stop being made, where's my Xbox series X version of Skyrim. I mean, I guess,
6423520	6428560	I guess they have like the boost ups from the Xbox one X, you know, I guess there's that,
6428560	6433600	but that's, I guess where's my, where's my, um, series X version of Skyrim.
6434960	6441920	Um, soon I'm sure. Yeah. I think we'll see a remaster of Oblivion pretty soon.
6442640	6446160	Oh, you do. Hmm. I think, I think Oblivion or, um,
6448320	6451680	I don't know, maybe one of the fallout games. We haven't remastered for yet.
6451680	6456480	Maybe they'll do a remaster of fallout four. Um, or, I mean, it'd be nice if they did new Vegas
6456480	6462560	or something like that, but like, Oh, whatever. You know what? I don't care. You know, Skyrim
6462560	6466720	though, like we give it crap because they keep re-releasing it, but that game is thoroughly
6466720	6472640	enjoyable every time I play it. I have no complaints whatsoever with that. Like I will
6472640	6478400	play that game a million times. Like it's no big deal. Uh, Zen monkey has a good, uh, comment in
6478400	6483280	her chat here over at, uh, Twitch TV slash VOG network who says, I don't think rockstar is taking
6483280	6491200	too long. I think consoles are just coming out too fast. Interesting. Yeah, I guess. And technically,
6491200	6496000	I feel like it's been the same rate, but I also get, I think it's more like the demands of what
6496000	6500640	the new consoles require. You know, if they want to make Grand Theft Auto six, a cutting edge,
6500640	6505360	beautiful, it's going to be a 4k game. That's going to take longer to make, you know? Yeah,
6505360	6510560	I guess I have to be patient and really I should probably give online another chance because they
6510560	6516560	have a ton of content out there. Like it really is, but I, I'm kind of old school in the sense
6516560	6522000	that I like, I like field expansions that they used to have, you know, with like single player
6522000	6528400	storylines and stuff. I don't necessarily like the con. I don't like the, the having to pay for
6528400	6535360	absolutely everything in Grand Theft Auto online, like buying stuff is fine, but paying to ensure
6535360	6542800	my car, paying rent for my apartment, paying to, you know, recent, it's just, it's a lot of like
6542800	6548560	grind that they purposely put in the game to make money. I just wish to get rid of it. Our chat room
6548560	6552320	is pointing out that in two more years, uh, Grand Theft Auto five will be eligible for classic game
6552320	6558160	of the week. Probably releasing yet another version of it. Rapid fire news. Whoops. Sorry,
6558400	6562480	I think the cat wants to leave here. Oh, okay. That's fine. It's, it's Stella's world. We're
6562480	6566480	just living in it. That's fine. I'm sure I was just going to sit here screaming at me.
6566480	6570640	Yeah. Um, that's the listeners love it. They're like kitty, kitty, kitty. Yay.
6571440	6577840	So it's a letter screen. Yeah. All right. Um, and then of course, uh, Last of Us two is getting an
6577840	6582560	update on PlayStation five. They're going to be doing an enhancement patch to that, uh, kind of
6582560	6590880	similar to what we see on Xbox series X, where they're upping the FPS from 30 to 60. So that's
6590880	6595520	pretty awesome. And that'll be coming soon. Nice. All right. What do you have?
6598960	6605600	Uh, you're also muted. I've only been muting myself because I have curry rice. That's fine.
6607280	6611680	Not eating in the mic is a good thing. Well, right. But sometimes, you know,
6611680	6619600	people got to eat. Um, so anyway, um, people have really, really, really, really, really
6619600	6624640	wanted the mass effect three multiplayer to come back. Um, and we know it's not there in the
6624640	6632320	legendary edition, but, um, uh, their project producer, Mac Walters in a CNET interview,
6632880	6640160	um, basically said he would never say no to it coming back in some form. Um, he's quoted saying,
6640160	6644320	we want to see what kind of reception the legendary edition gets and what demand for
6644320	6649040	the multiplayer is. And then we'll ask ourselves if we have the resources, the time to bring it up
6649040	6655920	to the quality level at fans one. So, uh, cool. I hope that happens. Make it cross-platform or
6655920	6660960	don't bother. Right. In my opinion, I, my strong opinion, by the way, you'll notice, I didn't
6660960	6665040	mention mass effect my game a week. I I've put the game after, after everything that I went through
6665040	6669680	last week, my, my emotions on the show, I said, you know what I think is best right now. I'm just
6669760	6674400	going to put that game on hold. Like it's, it's a timeless trilogy. I'll love it. When I play
6674400	6679600	through it, I'll play through it in a couple months. Like once a lot of these patch issues
6679600	6684160	and all that crap gets sorted out, then I'll play it, you know, I, why, why do I need to play it
6684160	6689840	right? Right. Now, you know, I discovered mass effect as a trilogy late. I didn't discover it
6689840	6693840	in 2007 when the first game came out or whatever it was, I discovered it way later. So you know
6693840	6699120	what? Cool. Anyway, but I w I would be down with multiplayer, don't get me wrong. Uh, and I think
6699120	6703360	it's the there's money in it for Bioware cause you know, they, they could charge for the packs
6703360	6710720	and things like that and they'll get their money. Um, but we'll see. Yeah. So at any rate, um, now,
6710720	6713920	and this is something I don't know that we brought up on this show, but it's definitely something
6713920	6721920	that's impacted a lot of, a lot of, uh, manga and video game fans is, uh, Miura Kentaro, who was the
6721920	6728800	mangaka behind Berserk died at 54. And of course we know we've had a couple of Berserk games. There
6728800	6735440	was the one on dream cast that came out in the U S uh, a while back called out. You, you've done
6735440	6740800	one as classic game of the week way back when, but one of them you highlighted. Yeah. I know,
6740800	6746640	but what, as I was saying, um, uh, it had BJ ward is one of the voice actors in it. And, uh,
6746640	6753920	God, why can't Michael bell as guts? Um, so two Voltron voice actors. Um, but at any rate, um,
6754480	6760800	because, uh, one of the final fantasy 14 classes, the dark knight was heavily influenced by the
6760800	6768640	character of guts. Um, uh, in one of the servers, um, I'm trying to see what server it was.
6769680	6777360	Um, uh, Balmung, um, in old doc, they had a bunch of dark nights, just standing
6777360	6782320	in a row with their pose with the, with their ginormous sword over their shoulder.
6783040	6789280	Um, to, uh, to pay tribute to his passing. Um, and the same thing was happening as some
6789280	6795520	of the other servers as well, just different, similar vigils. Um, but yeah, the, since the
6795520	6801680	dark knight was, you know, really inspired by guts, who then, um, of course, Mira had a lot
6801680	6807040	to do with that. Of course, his mark has shown up in many other character classes and games.
6807040	6813920	So, uh, and you know, the other sad thing for me is that this means berserk is never going to,
6813920	6823680	to have an ending. It actually, the last arc left off in berserk that I was reading had Casca
6823680	6831680	getting her, uh, her, uh, personality and memory back, but with a big, uh, hitch in her relationship
6831680	6837600	with guts. So I don't know if we're ever going to see that end if he's left any kind of successor.
6838400	6844160	So I don't know what'll happen. Um, Balmung, by the way, I think is probably still the biggest
6844160	6848000	Final Fantasy 14 server. There's like a ton of people that are on it. A lot of role-play stuff
6848000	6853280	that happens there. So I'm kind of not surprised that this, uh, happened on that server. So,
6854720	6858960	all right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and talk about some
6859040	6862080	games that are coming out this week. We'll start in the U S Loki.
6863040	6867600	All right. So we have bio mutant on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC,
6868480	6876320	Capcom arcade stadium on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, final fantasy 14 on
6876320	6882800	PlayStation five. Oh yeah. There's a big patch on Tuesday and the official release is this week.
6882800	6889520	Yeah. Yeah. Uh, King of the seas on a PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one,
6890240	6895920	man eater on the Nintendo switch dates row, the third remastered on PlayStation five and

6937680	6943440	Warhammer age of Sigmar storm ground on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6944320	6951760	And let's see song of horror PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, the world world's end club
6951760	6958960	on Nintendo switch. And finally wonder boy, Asha in monster world on Intel switch and PlayStation
6958960	6963840	four. That's a busy week, but also, um, probably with the summer on the horizon, a lot of folks
6963840	6968720	getting out of school and stuff. It's a, it's usually, usually this week before summer, so to
6968720	6974000	speak is a huge release window. So I'm not too surprised. Um, quite a few things coming out in
6974000	6979120	Japan as well, maybe not quite as crowded, but still, uh, on the Nintendo switch paradigm paradox,
6979120	6985360	uh, comes out on may 27th, as well as a limited edition for that, uh, tente Boku Metsu comes out
6985360	6990320	as well. Uh, world's end club gets a release and it's in English. Um, but that is still being
6990320	6995360	released in Japan. Uh, so you have that to look forward to as well as liberated, same thing going
6995360	6999760	on there. Uh, you also have man eater gets it's released in Japan this week. That is also on the
6999760	7005280	switch heading over to the PlayStation five. Uh, they'll say just one game Terminator resistance
7005280	7011040	enhanced. So there's that on the PlayStation five and for the PlayStation four this week,
7011040	7017280	uh, you have, uh, tente Boku Metsu is out there as well. Uh, the last of us two gets a price
7017280	7022560	reduction, uh, on PlayStation four this week. Biomutant is out this week as well in Japan.
7022560	7026560	And, um, I think that is about it. How about the UK dark soccer?
7028160	7033840	We have a few things on the 25th. We have Shin Megami Tensei three Nocturne HD remaster.
7034560	7041440	Um, also in the 25th, we have man-eater for switch, um, Biomutant for PlayStation, Xbox,
7041440	7049520	and, uh, PC. On the 27th, we have Asterix and Obelix, the XXL collection, um, for PlayStation
7049520	7055120	and switch on the 28th, we have instant sports tennis for switch and also for the switch port
7055120	7063920	Royale four. All right. That's it. Then we'll move on to some more stories. Uh, Loki, I think
7063920	7070000	you have our next story. Yeah. So we had, I think it was last week, Sony saying that they weren't
7070000	7074080	sure they're going to be able to meet the demand with PlayStation five. And you know,
7074080	7081200	Nintendo's like, Hey, hold my beer. Um, they're basically saying that they're also uncertain that
7081200	7088800	they're going to meet the insane demand of the Nintendo switch. Um, so apparently, you know,
7088800	7094080	they've sold a lot and the demand is still too high. Uh, right now they said they have ads for
7094080	7098320	production. We've achieved steady hardware production through the end of the last calendar
7098320	7103280	year. And as a result in the previous fiscal year, we set a record of our highest fourth quarter
7103840	7108880	sales volume. Meanwhile, the demand for hardware continues to exceed our expectations. Even the
7108880	7113600	beginning of this calendar year and production has currently not caught up to this high demand
7113600	7120560	due to tight supply and demand for semiconductor materials worldwide. So they're, they're trying,
7120560	7131120	but you know, the shortages they're affecting everyone. Um, gosh, there's, uh, um,
7132400	7136480	there's just a bunch of shortages that they're still expecting through this year. Like with the
7136480	7141120	whole PlayStation five, I think the graphics card things come out like this with all these, you know,
7141120	7146000	microchips and things, and just a lot of the stuff, you know, cause, and, and COVID honestly,
7146000	7150240	because even though COVID is in one kind of place here in the U S that's not what the rest of the
7150240	7155200	world looks like. So there's that as well. And, um, yeah, it's just, uh, it's not going to be a
7155200	7159680	pretty year for a lot of those holiday things. So, uh, you know, like I said, I don't, I still
7159680	7164320	don't have a PlayStation five. I don't know if I'm going to get one this year because of all this
7164320	7168160	otherwise around the winter time, I might be interested in getting one, but I just don't see
7168160	7175520	it actually happening sadly. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, well moving on and, um, speaking of,
7175520	7181520	uh, you know, um, the reality that COVID is still, still alive and well in the U S as well as many
7181520	7188720	parts, many parts of the world. Um, a lot of folks have noticed, uh, uh, Diego, uh, who is a, uh,
7189280	7193920	fighting game professional gamer. He's pretty well known in those, uh, communities, um,
7193920	7198960	has just been released from the hospital, uh, in a tweet, uh, on his account, Diego, the beast,
7198960	7203520	he wrote after nearly two weeks of treatment today, I was released from the hospital,
7203520	7208480	extremely grateful to the nurses and doctors for their devoted care, many thanks to my fans and
7208480	7213040	colleagues for the warm support. It will take time to get back to normal, but I'm so glad I'm
7213040	7218960	recovering. So, uh, it sounds like, uh, from what I was picking up on, um, he actually got like a
7218960	7225200	pneumonia as a result of COVID. And that is a very, um, scary situation. Um, I had a friend
7225200	7229520	many years ago and some of you might remember this on the show. Uh, she had swine flu and got
7229520	7234880	pneumonia as a result of that and she passed away. Uh, and she was only 24 and that was horrible.
7235760	7240000	My friend actually is still in the hospital and still on a ventilator. Oh no, I'm sorry to hear
7240000	7244400	that. Every time she's more responsive and every time they've tried to take her off the ventilator,
7244400	7251040	she's suffered for it. So she's still on. Um, but she went in with pneumonia and had COVID as a
7251040	7257840	result. Um, and she also had some kidney problems that were really highly exacerbated by it. So
7257840	7265120	she's been on dialysis. Oh my gosh. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm afraid
7265120	7270480	for her, whether she recovers or not, she's going to be wheelchair bound after this.
7270480	7275440	Yeah. Oh gosh. Well, still sending my thoughts, um, her way and hoping, um,
7275440	7280560	all can go as well as possible in this situation. So, uh, everyone just send KK to your love.
7282560	7287360	Um, now act-def talking about Daigo and the tweet that I was reading here, uh, we owe a lot,
7287360	7292800	uh, to Daigo on fighting games and competitive games getting mainstream. Um, and, um, yeah,
7292800	7297200	I mean, it's, it's, you know, to hear that this is still going on and, you know, to people that we,
7297200	7302880	you know, follow respect admire, it's just kind of a reminder. So even though, yes, you know,
7302880	7307040	vaccines are doing some amazing stuff here in the States. And I think, you know, I mentioned,
7307040	7310320	we're taking next week off and I think a lot of people are going to be kind of celebrating over
7310320	7315600	the long weekend. I think it's still a reminder. You got to still take some sense of precaution,
7315600	7320720	especially if you're not vaccinated, if you're not vaccinated, um, you really owe it to other
7320720	7325920	people to still protect, uh, people from potentially getting the virus, you know? So,
7325920	7330320	um, you know, take precautions and let stories like this be a warning. You don't want this to be
7330320	7336880	you. So, because it never happens to you until it does. And then why did it happen to me? Anyway,
7337520	7341600	all right, moving on. Uh, we have another story, which I think is Dark Sakura's.
7344080	7350400	Let me unmute now that I have taken a sip, um, or taken a bite. So this is kind of cool. There
7350400	7362880	is an old school Xbox Easter egg that people have found after 20 years. Um, so, uh, basically, um,
7362880	7367600	well, and it actually, it was disclosed by the developer, um, one of the developers who worked
7367600	7375360	on the Xbox, um, basically because it had never been found, he said how to do it. So you'll need
7375360	7383120	to, uh, rip a CD to your Xbox hardware. And when you're prompted to name the album, you type in
7383840	7391760	Timmy with 26 Y's and an exclamation point. It's pronounced Timmy. It is, but I am
7393760	7401200	spelling it out anyway. Um, what happens after that is that, um,
7401200	7409760	it will show you a different credit screen, uh, in the system information option, uh, that will,
7409760	7417360	uh, list members of the Xbox dashboard team. So that's pretty cool. They, um, also in response
7417360	7422640	to this Seamus Blackley, who is also an amazing Baker extraordinaire, and I have learned a lot
7422640	7430160	from him, um, has, uh, actually reached out and told Kotaku that he wasn't aware of the
7430160	7436080	that he wasn't aware of that Easter egg, but he says there's at least one last surprise the Xbox
7436080	7442720	fans have not found, and he's not going to tell you how to trigger it. Oh, good luck.
7444640	7450160	Yeah. Has anyone, has anyone tried entering Cartman in the disc ripping stream? Uh, which
7450160	7454880	I totally forgot the Xbox would rip, uh, audio discs. I totally forgot that that was the thing
7454880	7459040	until I was seeing the story myself and I was like, oh yeah, that was the thing you could do.
7459040	7465200	Like, I think I, I think I ripped the Echo image album from back in the day, uh, you know,
7465200	7469280	DDR and all that stuff. I think I ripped that to my original Xbox because you could, you could play
7469280	7475920	games with music like that was ripped to the, um, uh, system. It's kind of neat. So anyway,
7475920	7480080	that's cute that we're finding all these Easter eggs. What, literally 20 years later as, uh, you
7480080	7486080	know, Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox. So it's kind of fun for sure. That's pretty cool.
7486080	7492560	Meanwhile, on the Sony front, what do we have Loki? Some weird stuff, you know? Uh, so the,
7492560	7499040	apparently back when Epic was testing the Unreal three engine on the PlayStation three,
7499040	7506640	they had built some kind of proof of concepts to basically, um, test out the engine on the hardware
7506640	7514480	and some of the things that they did were port, um, I unreal over to the PlayStation three. And
7514480	7520720	also they also have a version of gears of war three that runs on the PlayStation three.
7520720	7528320	And well, thanks to a digital archivist, uh, by the name of pixel butts, he has decided to, uh,
7528320	7537360	release the, the demo, um, out to the internet archives. And, um, now you're not necessarily
7537360	7541760	going to be able to run this on PlayStation three hardware only runs on a dev unit, but I think
7541760	7548320	through emulation, you might be able to do some of it. Um, right now though, or you could just
7548320	7555680	get it on your Xbox. It's literally the same game. Right. But it, it's forbidden now to play it on a
7555680	7560000	PlayStation three. So you're doing something you're not supposed to do. Yeah. Right. So
7560640	7566320	apparently though, it's not optimized obviously. And, um, it does have several caveats to get it
7566480	7574400	run. Uh, the emulator only can reach the title screen, but, um, I guess if you happen to own
7574400	7579760	a dev piece of hardware for PlayStation three, you can see a title screen. No, no, no. You can
7579760	7584480	actually play the game. Oh, okay. Emulator can only get to the, Oh, got it. Got it. Got it. Okay.
7584480	7591040	Yeah. So neat. Although not when you put it in the context of Epic was testing the unreal engine on
7591040	7594400	PlayStation and this is what they used to do it. It's actually kind of like, Oh, okay. Well that
7594400	7598800	actually totally makes sense. Even if this game that they were making was, uh, you know,
7598800	7606720	an exclusive to Microsoft. So, uh, interesting. All right. Uh, less interesting and actually
7606720	7611760	kind of pissing some people off has to do with a new Amiibo that's coming out for Zelda Skyward
7611760	7616640	sword. Uh, and of course, Skyward sword HD is coming out what in July? And there's going to
7616640	7622480	be a new Amiibo that comes with it, a Zelda and loft wing Amiibo. And, uh, it's putting a feature
7622480	7627840	in this Amiibo. So it's not unheard of that like Amiibos do like interesting weird things in the
7627840	7633600	game, but this one's almost a little bit more because it actually allows you to zip between the
7633600	7639600	games airborne overworld and Hyrule surface, uh, which was not something that was available in the
7639600	7645440	original game. Um, it's a time saver. So, you know, uh, we've been talking a little bit about
7645440	7651200	summer games done quick and, uh, you know, Bobby's very involved with that and has been, uh, promoting
7651200	7658080	that coming up in a few weeks. This could do a lot for speed running, but it's an Amiibo and it's
7658080	7663600	something that you have to buy. Basically not only is it an Amiibo only functionality, by the way,
7663600	7670720	this Amiibo is $10 more than your normal Amiibo. It's $25, not 15. Well, I mean, it's not the first
7670720	7676000	time that Nintendo's put out a more expensive Amiibo because like, uh, that giant Yoshi egg,
7676000	7683440	Yoshi yarn thing, that was like a $40 Amiibo, but it was a giant one. I mean, this one, I think it's
7683440	7686960	a little bigger and it's a little more detailed, but still, I mean, you can't help, but kind of
7686960	7692000	raise your eyebrow at what's going on. Oh, and by the way, they wonder why people pirate those
7692000	7699280	Amiibos then. Yes. And by the way, because this sold out, this, uh, the feature, this more, they
7699280	7707840	sold out instantly, uh, gone in the UK, the U S you name it, scalpers bought them up. So, um, yeah,
7707840	7716480	I, uh, I, I want to, you know, as much as I do not like to endorse piracy here on the show, I think
7716480	7721520	this is one of those situations where we need to remind people, uh, it is possible to make your own
7721520	7729840	Amiibo, uh, not saying you can make it with the, um, the, um, uh, figure and all that stuff, but you
7729840	7734640	can actually, if you want to unlock this feature, there is a way you can do that. Look, you know a
7734640	7738480	little bit more about this, right? It's like, you can actually create your own ARFID tags and all
7738480	7744240	this stuff, right? Yeah. So you, you basically, you buy these tags that are like on Amazon or eBay or
7744240	7750560	whatever you just buy the specific, um, RFID tags. And then what they normally do is they will store
7750560	7756400	them in like, it's like a sticker almost. And then people will buy like, um, they're like coin
7756400	7761440	collector cases. And so it's like a little coin and you basically print out artwork for it and
7761440	7766000	stuff and stick the sticker on there or like poker chips or something like that. So something small,
7766000	7771040	but basically it's a sticker and there's people online that will read, or you can actually read
7771040	7776320	your own Amiibo, um, using just like an Android phone and there's an app, an APA APK you can
7776320	7781840	download to it that you can run and basically copy or download Amiibos to these tags.
7781840	7786160	Have a whole binder of these. Yeah. You can have like, you know, basically
7786160	7793200	50 tags, I think are like 20 bucks. I have all these animal crossing cards too.
7793920	7798640	Yeah. So it's, it's basically, it's like that in a lot of people leak them online,
7798640	7802720	especially if it's something hard to find like this, it'll be online. It'll be online
7802720	7808400	immediately. And so you can just, you know, download it. And then eventually if you stop
7808400	7812800	playing, you know, this game, then you can download another one to it.
7813840	7818080	And again, this isn't a topic I enjoy discussing here on OLR, but when they put these kinds of
7818080	7823600	features away in the game and scalpers end up getting everything, um, and that's the person
7823600	7827040	that's going to get hurt. I don't think Nintendo is going to get hurt as much by this as scalpers
7827040	7831040	will because, Hey, Nintendo sold all their inventory, but the gamers would like to still
7831040	7836080	be able to, uh, have the feature. So as far as I'm concerned, fuck them. And I mean, scalpers,
7836080	7841520	fuck them. Like, you know, okay. Thanks for giving Nintendo money so we can have a feature.
7842480	7846560	I guess, although I'm not the biggest fan of the implementation, don't get me wrong.
7846560	7850640	But at the same time, if these amiibo were more readily available, I probably wouldn't be having
7850640	7854240	this discussion right now. We'd probably be having more of a discussion about, well, should they be
7854240	7857760	charging so much money? Shouldn't they have other ways to unlock this feature and so forth. But,
7857920	7865600	um, as far as I'm concerned, uh, make your own amiibo. Who cares? So, yeah. All right. Anyhow,
7866640	7870960	let's move on and get to the listener round table. And this is the part where we, uh,
7870960	7876000	get you guys involved with the show, uh, via, um, your emails and any chat questions you might have
7876000	7880560	over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, uh, we'll get some of your discord comments as well.
7880560	7884400	There's some good stuff throughout the week this week. So, uh, we have some emails, I think
7884400	7888800	tonight though. So we'll start with dark soccer and, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.
7888800	7895600	If you want to send an email for a future week. We do. So, uh, first email comes from Robert M.
7896320	7901440	I would love to see the enhanced me editing features in Miitopia for the switch patched
7901440	7907600	into smash ultimate and use for later games that use me such as Mario golf, super rush.
7907600	7911440	Would this be a good idea or bad idea? It's an idea.
7911440	7915600	Why not? Um, I, you know, thank you for reminding us that Miitopia came out this
7915600	7919600	week cause I plum forgot. Um, but I know Bobby was talking a little bit about it on his show
7919600	7924000	tonight. I guess they have a very robust demo that came out for it. Um, so maybe I'll check that out
7924000	7928080	at some point. Um, but yeah, why I think people love to have fun with those means, of course,
7928080	7931760	they love to make, um, you know, celebrities and things they shouldn't be making in there and,
7931760	7936000	and, you know, scandalous things. But I think it just kind of shows that people,
7936000	7940160	people have fun flexing their creative muscles with this stuff. Why shouldn't we put it in some
7940160	7945280	of the other games like smash brothers and stuff? I think it's fun. Um, so yeah, why not? But I will
7945280	7951120	Nintendo do it. I, although, you know, with as much shit as we give Nintendo, like in that last
7951120	7956320	story, I will say Nintendo is very good at supporting their products long after launch.
7956320	7961840	Um, and you know, putting out DLC literally years after the fact or something like the Mario party
7961840	7968640	story, like finally online years after the fact, but it's here and it's no extra cost. So hooray.
7968640	7973040	Um, so never say never, but I also don't know if Nintendo would be interested in really,
7973040	7976400	you know, going back and messing with, um, smash brothers, but they're still doing DLC.
7976400	7981040	So it's not like, it's like a game that's completely, you know, in the archives at
7981040	7986000	this point. So never say never. Um, but I think you, your suggestion is sound. Why not?
7986800	7995280	Yeah. Why not? So, um, next email. Sure. In honor of mental health awareness month,
7995280	7999680	how have you personally grown through gaming? And this is, this comes from D.
8000480	8004080	This is a heavy question. Thank you for the question though. I think it's important to
8004080	8008640	talk about, um, but, uh, maybe not everyone necessarily wants to, you read the question
8008640	8012400	one more time in chat, pay attention. If you're willing to share, I'd love to read some of your
8012400	8016240	responses as well. I'm not sure we're all going to have one, but, um, if you could read the question
8016240	8021840	one more time, dark soccer in honor of mental health awareness month, how have you personally
8021840	8029680	grown through gaming? Um, for me, and I've talked a little bit about this on the show in the past,
8029680	8034960	but like when I was young, um, and I'm talking like fourth, fifth, sixth grade,
8034960	8040480	I was bullied a lot because I was a little more effeminate than a little more nerdy than some,
8040480	8047360	uh, other kids my age. Um, but video, so it was this weird thing where I would get picked on by
8047360	8055840	other kids, but because I played video games, then those bullies would try to talk to me later when
8055840	8062640	nobody else was around and ask me for video game tips. So it was this weird thing where like the
8062640	8069200	fact that I was such a gamer and I played video games made bullies show another side of themselves
8069200	8074480	to me. It was very strange. Um, but that's just like this weird thing that I grew up with because
8074480	8078720	of games. I know that's like really, really old, but obviously this formative years were like huge
8078720	8085520	on my mental health and so forth. Um, and, um, it's easy. I also kind of think of the times
8086640	8092800	when I was younger and I'm talking like 22, 23, probably just before the show started,
8092800	8099440	I came out as gay when I was in my 20, when I was 20. Uh, and so those first few years, you know,
8099440	8103200	and then like, you know, OLR started four, four years later. But in those first few years,
8103200	8108320	I found a lot in the gay community that like, it was like a lot of like judgment
8108320	8114000	and stuff when I was a gamer, it was like, oh, you play video games. Like, and it was, if it,
8114000	8118560	you know, it was hard to get a date because it was like, oh, I don't know fashion. I don't know,
8119200	8124080	uh, you know, the latest, uh, I'm not trying to be stereotypical, but these are like things that
8124080	8130400	I faced back then is it was like, I am like a nerdy type and that wasn't desirable. Now,
8130400	8134880	the nice thing isn't what, you know, your question is, is a little bit more of a positive and how I
8134880	8140480	make this a positive is that I really do see us now all these years later, haven't done this show
8140480	8146080	for 20 years before. I think a lot of that is getting better, but to tie it back to something
8146080	8152400	else we talked about earlier in the show, it's because people like me have been able to find my
8152400	8160080	tribe. And that's why the tagging in that shit is so important. Like I'm living proof, you know,
8160080	8167760	and now I'm in this position where I actually have it kind of good, you know, as a, as a cis white
8167760	8172480	gay dude, you know what I mean? So I have privileges that a lot of other people are
8172480	8177760	still trying to, you know, find their tribes and, and, uh, work together to, uh, you know,
8177760	8182960	educate the rest of society on, you know, these, these other issues. So anyway, that's kind of why
8182960	8187040	I bring that up is I do think that that was something where gaming, but I never, I never
8187040	8193040	apologized for it either. I never tried to be something I wasn't, you know, like, I liked games
8193040	8198400	deal with it. People should just always be themselves and you'll find the, you know,
8198400	8205200	the right people when you're your authentic self, uh, reading some comments from chat,
8205200	8209200	and then I'll go to dark soccer and Loki. If they have anything they want to add, um, pod culture
8209200	8214320	says animal crossing has helped me with calming from anxiety. Gaming in general has helped with
8214320	8220720	my depression. Um, act deaf says, I think video games helped me socialize more. I was a really
8220720	8226240	shy person still am kind of, but making connections through gaming allowed me to speak up to others.
8226240	8230880	Oh, this, you know, you don't talk mental health gaming has been critical during this pandemic
8230880	8237760	critical. I w I would not have made it if I couldn't play MMOs with people online or, uh,
8237760	8242320	animal crossing and this stuff, you know, like I, I think they've been more important than ever
8242320	8245920	with everything that we're going through. Um, Jamie, do you have anything you want to add?
8245920	8250320	You don't have to, but I want to give you guys an opportunity. Gaming was always my outlet
8250320	8256080	and I learned a lot through it. And honestly, I've never made any apologies for being a gamer.
8256240	8261680	Yeah. Um, certainly coming to doing this show is really given me thicker skin.
8263680	8268480	Yeah. You know, um, and you obviously you've had to deal with that in a way that Loki and I don't,
8268480	8272640	I've, I've gotten, you know, I just a little bit over the years I get the whole, you know,
8272640	8276640	you remember when we would get the email that would be like, you're so Rob, you're so cool,
8276640	8281440	but I wish you would look to Jesus to, you know, uh, with your lifestyle, you know,
8281840	8287520	all that kind of stuff, which it's unfortunate, but, um, my answer is no, I'm not gonna change
8287520	8294000	who I am. Uh, and no, no thing that you, uh, you can believe all you want about all that,
8294000	8301760	but like I, my maker made me who I am period. So anyway. Um, and, uh, yeah. So anyways, but,
8301760	8307360	but you dark soccer, you've had to, you know, you get the real trash bag. Well, more so in the past
8307360	8311360	though. Again, I think that's a, well, I'm not to, not to dismiss or say it doesn't happen at
8311360	8316960	all, but you, I think you would agree. It was a lot worse than the earlier years before more women
8316960	8324720	were podcasting. Let's be real. It's just a matter of, I'm trying to think of how to phrase it,
8324720	8332080	of sticking to your guns and staying authentic. Um, let me get some more chat comments. Uh,
8332080	8336000	DJ Rama S says one game got me through a very bad time in my teenage years.
8336000	8341920	That game is secretive manna. I was, that was an incredible game. Um, I'm sure, you know,
8341920	8346640	how it applied for you in that situation was very different from how it applied for me. But
8346640	8352800	I think that game means a lot to a lot of different things to many people. Um, SSU 100 Matt says,
8352800	8357680	but personally gaming has helped me manage stress and help me get out of my downtimes in my life.
8357680	8361680	Sometimes the distraction and working on constructive in a different media has helped
8361680	8367120	me get out of my own head and out of depressive times. Interesting construction and creativity
8367120	8372400	and that sort of thing. I, I, we hear that a lot. Um, pardon me, one more comment here. Um,
8373280	8379040	meshkins in our chat says this show along with gaming has helped me discover myself and who I am
8379680	8385920	and I'm slowly coming into myself and who I am as a person that is, um, I don't know if there's
8385920	8390400	a better compliment somebody could give us about this show. So I just thank you so much for that.
8390640	8394960	And when people say, you know, even though just earlier in the show, I was like, I don't know
8394960	8401520	how this show gets past 20 years. When I think of things like that, then I kind of go, I probably
8401520	8410960	got another five years in me. Am I right? You know, so, um, thank you for that. All right.
8410960	8414880	Anyhow. Um, uh, Loki, I don't want to skip you. Do you have anything you want to add?
8415440	8419440	Oh, I just met lots of people through gaming, but I don't think it's really,
8420720	8426160	I don't know. I don't think it changed. Fair enough. Fair enough. I guess, but,
8426160	8429520	but it's, it's mental health in the way that again, it's finding, it's finding your people,
8429520	8433200	it's finding your tribe. It's, it's, it's the same thing, even if it's in a different way,
8433200	8437680	you know? True. Yeah. Yes. I guess that makes sense. Yeah. All right. Um, thank you for the
8437680	8443200	email for, for such a short succinct email. That was a hard hitting, but really good question. Um,
8443280	8447600	and it's important. We talk about mental health. Uh, we've, we sure talked enough about COVID.
8448160	8452080	That's a physical health thing. Why don't we talk about mental health as frequently?
8452080	8455920	It's good to know. Yeah. All right. Anyway, uh, is there more, I think there's at least one more,
8455920	8463840	right? Um, yeah, just one more. So, um, and this comes from our own Rama. Hey Rob,
8463840	8468880	oh, it's for you. Okay. Um, I, I had mentioned before that I may know the reason why patches
8468880	8472960	for console games are huge. You might think it's crazy, but please bear in mind the company I used
8472960	8479280	to work for. Okay. Most Xbox games are run in a virtual environment as a disc image, especially
8479280	8484800	the Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are backwards compatible. So what companies do is patch the
8484800	8489600	game and upload it so that if the game you bought has a patch, it will still be, it will still
8489600	8494400	download the game instead of copying the disc. But the disc still will be the license key to
8494400	8499840	play the game. This is done so that the console doesn't have to run any commands to patch the game
8499840	8504640	in case the patching goes wrong. Um, and given your recent issue with Mass Effect,
8504640	8510240	legendary edition EA screwed up the patching on that. And if you notice Sony does something
8510240	8515760	similar with PlayStation games, I know that sounds crazy, but companies feel it's easier that way,
8515760	8520720	but they don't realize the burden it puts on those data caps. I hope this answers your questions.
8520720	8525760	If not, let me know and I'll see what I can do game on y'all DJ run mass. No, he said it right
8525760	8529920	there at the end. They don't realize the burden that they're putting on us normal people with
8529920	8535840	data caps. Bingo. That was it. So I'm, I'm, but, but as far as like your explanation and stuff,
8535840	8540160	it doesn't make sense, but I, you know, because I'm pretty sure most of the times all the disc
8540160	8546320	is doing, especially now on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, where the whole solid state drive
8546320	8551200	is part of the experience. You can't do that from a disc. So yes, it pulls down the whole disc and
8551200	8554960	basically like, or, you know, the, the parts that it needs and basically puts it on your drive.
8554960	8559600	And that disc at that point is just how you unlock and play it. Uh, so that the game knows
8559600	8563040	you still have the license rights to be able to use it. All of that makes perfect sense.
8563680	8568000	Why can't the patching just patch the parts that have already installed my hard drive? That's I,
8568000	8572960	and that's what they're all missing. Um, I, and I get what you, I, again, I understand what you're
8572960	8578160	saying, but at the same time, I just wish they would approach it differently so that it can be
8578160	8585360	more respectful of that whole thing. Yeah. All right. Any other emails? All right. No.
8586160	8591600	All right. Um, let's get into, uh, Bobby does point out some patches are large because the
8591600	8596800	files on your hard drive are compressed. Interesting. You know, steam takes forever
8596800	8601520	to patch things like dead by daylight. And I always thought it took so damn long because it
8601520	8606960	was uncompressing, patching, compressing. And honestly, if I have to wait longer to have that
8606960	8612240	experience on console for smaller patches, I'm more than happy to take it. But I get the consoles
8612240	8616800	are probably a little more confined with the drive space. It just, it just sucks. Can I just
8616800	8623920	sit here as a gamer and say, it sucks. I don't like it. All right. Um, Hey Shad, Starsix in
8623920	8627840	chat. You missed, you missed the birthday shout out earlier. I'm not doing it again,
8627840	8633040	but I hope you had a good one. Uh, Shad, Starsix in chat and says, why is resident evil eight such
8633040	8638640	a good game? And the second area of the game, the scariest thing in gaming since PT or resident
8638640	8644640	evil seven VR discuss. Um, I couldn't tell you cause I haven't played it, but from what I've
8644640	8651920	heard about it, cause I've caught some things here and there. Um, it's just sounds, it sounds scary
8651920	8657440	because the character design is pretty crazy. Uh, it is not, from what I understand the lady
8657440	8662240	Dimitrescu and that is not like, she's just one part of the game. She's kind of like,
8663200	8669280	like in mega man, she would be like quick man. And then you still have other people you have
8669280	8673920	to fight quick man was the tall one, right? No, it was that flash, man. I forget anyway.
8676880	8681440	Uh, but otherwise I would ask, see, Alan is right over there and I would ask him about
8681440	8685440	resident evil seven because he's been playing it on his stream, except, um, he's not wearing
8685440	8690320	a shirt right now and he's cooking, so I can't really bring him on stream. But, um, I know he's
8690320	8694320	been going through resident evil seven and I know that's, I haven't watched him play. I am very
8694320	8699120	supportive of my husband streaming and you should follow him at Allen alchemy. Can he even hear me
8699120	8702240	talking about him right now with his headphones in? Probably not. No, he thinks he's listening
8702240	8707200	to something else. Um, but, uh, I would, uh, I will not watch the resident evil seven stuff
8707200	8715280	cause there's too damn many jumpscares and my old heart can't take it. But anyway, um,
8715360	8721760	all right, let's see other comments in chat. Um, let's see. Uh, Oh, Oh, thank you. Chatter
8721760	8725680	chatters are given chain. The birthday wishes now in chat since he missed his at the beginning
8725680	8729920	of the show. I talked about that text you sent me with the damn Tron arcade one up.
8730640	8734480	All right. Anyway, uh, Oh, I'll get to discord and then we'll get some last minute stories.
8734480	8738880	Cause I know we have a few of those tonight. Um, but first, uh, let me do a couple topics
8738880	8743040	from discord. There was one thing, okay. And so over on discord, of course, over at vog
8743040	8747600	network.com slash discord, we'll get you into our server and we have a whole channel for orange
8747600	8751680	lounge radio and you guys like to post things there throughout the week, including, Ooh,
8751680	8756880	I didn't know about this. They're making a technical documentary. Interesting called
8756880	8762240	touching sound. Oh, it's already out and you can stream it on something called to be,
8762240	8766800	which is one of those app services. You can stream that for free. Is that literally about
8766800	8772560	DJ max technica and that it has to be, it's the same thing. So I wonder now, now Shane's in chat,
8772560	8778720	I wonder if he knows about this, a whole movie documentary on technica. That's interesting. All
8778720	8784800	right. Uh, something else they've been posting about, uh, in our discord server, I think this
8784800	8789920	is very interesting. Tiger claw linked us to a tweet, uh, that is an indie developer making a
8789920	8795120	fighting game, but it uses cars and there's actually, uh, some little, uh, video of this
8795120	8800400	in action. It looks very interesting. Uh, I didn't catch what the name of the game is though, but the
8800400	8806240	tweet, the person on Twitter who did this, uh, fontace ranter is, uh, the person that did this.
8806240	8809760	And there's some other people that were kind of just discussing it and, uh, Oh, it's called
8809760	8813520	shut up and drive. Thank you that there. Cause there's an FAQ that was linked there. So.
8814080	8819360	Isn't that a Rihanna song? Uh, it is. And one of the greatest lip syncs in drag race history. Yes.
8819360	8824400	But, uh, in this case, it's also a video game. She doesn't own that phrase. Uh, shut up and
8824400	8828320	drive is something we've all been saying on the freeway for a long time. It was used in, um,
8829280	8834000	uh, wreck it Ralph. That's right. You can't help but hear that though. When, uh, you know, you,
8834000	8838720	you see a name like that and you know, even though this is an indie studio, I hope somehow Rihanna
8838720	8843680	would give the rights so that it can be in the trailer. Shut up and drive. Okay. I better not
8843680	8850080	sing too much or we're going to get DCM made. Um, Tiger claw also linked us to a tweet from
8850080	8856720	X-Box where, uh, they were talking about it's 2007. What are you booting up? And the screenshot had
8856800	8862800	halo three bio shock mass effect and rock band. This was a play on another viral tweet, uh,
8862800	8868080	that was like a movie had made like an eighties cinema with some quintessential eighties films.
8868080	8873760	So they like photoshopped it. And I was like, Oh, rock band for sure. Hello. Hello. Anyway,
8873760	8877360	let's do some last minute stories and I'll do a few more of your comments from discord. Um,
8877360	8880720	dark soccer, I think you mentioned you had something tonight that you wanted to fit in here.
8881280	8886400	I did. It's just a little something, but on the 25th, so this Tuesday, um,
8887360	8892000	uh, there's going to be an announcement for dead by daylight and they've already teased this,
8892000	8897280	but for resident evil's 25th anniversary, um, dead by daylight is getting, uh, resident evil,
8897920	8903520	uh, a resident evil chapter for their 20th chapter. Um, lots of speculation as to what's
8903520	8911360	going on. They are saying that there's, uh, um, highlights back to the classics.
8912240	8915920	So there's a lot of people thinking that it's going to be centered around the original resident
8915920	8920080	evil. There's still people who are thinking it's going to be like from village. I don't know,
8920720	8924880	but the hope is that, I mean, one of the big theories out there is that this is actually
8924880	8931360	going to be multiple maps. Um, and at least two killers and two survivors. So we'll see
8931360	8938960	a big pack if that's true. I that's so, well, I mean the stranger things, one was one killer,
8939920	8946800	a map and two survivors and that's like 12 bucks. Yeah. So this is, if it's that big,
8946800	8952960	it's probably going to at least be $20 DLC and I will do it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I, I would love
8952960	8957920	to see village in it. Um, I personally, I would love to see lady David Trescu. I think she's just
8957920	8963040	such a character and she'd be so good as a killer in day by day by daylight. I have heard the rumor
8963040	8967600	about her daughters being one of the killers and that they're witches that you can like switch
8967600	8973120	between and shape shift. I think that's kind of cool too. I'm down with that. Someone did a mod
8973760	8981840	that turns, I think Dwight into Ethan or David into Ethan cause the body shape and then, um,
8982320	8987280	one of the daughters into nurse or from nurse. Hmm. Interesting. But I think a lot of the heavy
8987280	8994240	rumors are that it's Jill and Leon and it's a nemesis and I'm kind of like, you're probably
8994240	9004960	right. I thought I read who's the character in four. I thought that was, I didn't play four.
9004960	9009360	Okay. That was Leon though. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, but if they were going to do Leon,
9009360	9014480	it should be like Leon and Claire. I mean, I think they would do Jill and Chris and have
9014480	9019920	skins for Leon and Claire. Oh, that makes sense. Cause they are speaking of stranger things. They
9019920	9024960	are doing a skin for Steve to turn him into the other character. It doesn't look right. Cause
9024960	9032800	his face structure is so different. No, it doesn't. Um, uh, but the, uh, I think, I mean,
9032800	9037040	I think it would honestly be super possible, especially if it's nemesis, it would be really
9037040	9042800	easy to have a cosmetic for mr. X. Yeah. Um, I'm still going to cross my fingers that the
9042800	9047840	vampress, the vampires or the witches are going to be the killer, but I think we're going to get
9047840	9052560	skins for those. If it's nemesis, I'll still buy, who am I kidding? I'm going to buy it.
9052560	9060240	And look at what they did for, for, uh, Heather in, uh, in the, sorry, Cheryl. I played her as
9060240	9068480	Heather. So long. I still call her Heather. Um, in, uh, uh, the re the silent Hill chapter
9068480	9076320	is that they gave her the, uh, Sybil skin and the, uh, the nurse, what was her name?
9078240	9086960	Lisa, Lisa Garland. And that they, uh, also gave her the, um, uh, Alyssa skin.
9087760	9093360	Um, our R H M zero eight seven in chat says, would it be strange for one of the survivors
9093360	9097760	to have special powers? See my previous comment on Scott Howard, not to be confused with Scott
9097760	9102560	McCall. Um, no, no, no, it would not be weird for, you know, they'll, they'll do a talent.
9102560	9109040	That's gonna mix things up perks. Like for example, um, you got, you know, perks that
9109040	9114560	let you fight back from Laurie. Yeah. Or, um, I would say the biggest example is a leather face,
9114560	9119680	uh, and barbecue and chili is like a, a, I don't want to say a mandatory killer talent,
9119680	9123600	but the quality of life from that singular talent, it's like, you kind of like, like,
9123600	9130000	you have to get that DLC, which what a clever way to make people buy DLC, huh? But, um, yeah.
9131040	9133520	So yes, they could do, they could do things that are really going to mix it up,
9133520	9136800	but I don't think they would be unique to the character. They'd be unique to the perks.
9137600	9144960	Um, yeah, but the whole thing is, is that the, the, um, the survivors cannot attack a killer
9145680	9153440	except for like blind, the escape tactics, like decisive strike. Um, so, you know,
9153440	9160560	and you do have like distraction, things like the pebble, everyone loves the pebble. Um, um,
9161360	9165520	I'm sorry, that's good. And like things like that are good for against killers that, you know,
9165520	9172480	are use audio based clues like, um, nurse and a spirit for example. Yeah. But yeah, I think that,
9172480	9178160	um, we're not going to have any that can actually just legit fight back or David, the character,
9178160	9181760	David would have been completely screwed over. Cause that was his whole storyline as a fighter.
9181760	9185760	Um, an RHM in chat says a literal werewolf. I just, I just don't think so. They're not,
9185760	9189520	they can't do anything that's going to completely like turning into a werewolf and being able to
9189520	9194160	run super fast or whatever the werewolf can do like fight back. We already have sprint burst.
9194160	9198640	Yeah. I already have dead hard. They can't do something that's going to completely break the
9198640	9203280	game. And it's also, it's part of dead by daylight's nature that the perks transfer from
9203280	9206880	character to character. So somebody can turn into a werewolf. They all need to be able to turn into
9206880	9211760	werewolf. And that would just be a little, a little weird now, but at the same time,
9211760	9215520	they've talked to, you know, and I don't want to completely dismiss the comment. It's a fair
9216640	9221680	idea because they have also said it's the fifth anniversary. This resident evil thing is going
9221680	9225200	to change up the game a little bit. We have new things in store for this game. You know,
9225200	9229040	it's five years old and people are just now finding it and we're going to mix it up a little
9229040	9235040	bit. So I say all this, but at the same time, maybe they will do something completely radical
9235040	9240720	and different. Um, your idea is not farfetched in that regard. So there's one way to find out and
9240720	9247440	that's watch on Tuesday. So I'm excited about it. Are you? Um, yeah, yeah. I mean, now that I'm into
9247440	9252480	this game for sure. I want to see the reveal. I'm actually almost more interested in the roadmap
9252480	9257760	for the future. Yeah. Well, they're, they're going to definitely be doing some talking about that on,
9257760	9266080	um, on a Tuesday as well. I'm glad it's my day off. Um, but, but that DLC itself is going to
9266080	9272640	be coming out, um, later on in June. Yeah. Um, okay. Now, uh, let me get to some other
9272640	9276720	discord comments and I'll check in with Loki here. Um, let's see. Oh, I thought this was
9276720	9281680	interesting. Dungeon buster shared a tweet, uh, from Jason Schreier. Hope I said that right.
9281680	9286720	Who said, uh, it was kind of countering and he's, he's does game journalism stuff. I'm sorry. I
9286720	9289680	don't, I don't follow them all. I don't know who they work for. Cause they always move around and
9289680	9294080	stuff. Sorry. I, sorry. Uh, but, uh, it says rumors like this keep floating around, but
9294080	9299280	starfield is nowhere near done. According to several people familiar with development,
9299280	9303440	it'll be at E3, but the plan release date I've heard is way later than most people think.
9304240	9308960	Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't either, but at the same time,
9308960	9315840	Bethesda usually doesn't show the inner workings of the game until it is ready.
9315840	9320240	So I'm not completely pushing back on the comment. I mean, obviously he has more industry,
9320240	9326640	you know, insiders and stuff than I certainly do, but I would wonder how much are they really going
9326640	9332160	to show it if they're not ready to show, you know, to, to release the game, that's not usually
9332160	9337920	Bethesda's thing. At the same time, something very different has happened in the last year with
9337920	9344080	Bethesda. Microsoft bought them. So maybe that is going to change their entire approach. That is
9344080	9350160	certainly a, uh, thought within the realm of possibility. It is plausible. All right. I'll
9350160	9357840	just fucking say it. It's plausible. So, but we'll see at E3, huh? All right. Uh, Bobby says he's
9357840	9362320	actually a journalist doing actual journalism. He's with Bloomberg. Thank you. I can, I can never
9362320	9366960	follow. They're at Kotaku one day, Polygon the next, then they're going, they're, they're working
9366960	9373360	at a newspaper somewhere else. Sorry. It's just, it's hard to keep track. All right. Anyhow. Uh,
9373360	9378080	let's see. Loki, do you have any last minute stories? Um, yeah, I did have one. Unfortunately,
9378080	9384080	the servers for LittleBigPlanet had to be shut down temporarily because somebody hacked into
9384080	9389920	them and put a bunch of transphobic comments everywhere on all of the different, um, levels.
9390800	9398480	So, um, well, at least, you know what, as old as that game is at this point,
9398480	9403760	I'm glad they're doing the right thing and fucking stopping that. So you know what? It's
9403760	9407600	the temporary shutdown. They just have to clean the issue up, but it's, it's because it's so
9407600	9413920	widespread. I see this as a good thing. Not the hack, not that, but the fact that Sony is still
9413920	9417600	going back and addressing it and cleaning it the fuck up. That's a good thing. Thank you.
9417600	9423280	Yeah. Oh, is that it? That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I think we're about to the
9423280	9427760	end of the show and, uh, Alan just finished dinner, so I'm ready to eat. So we're going
9427760	9432400	to wrap things up. Uh, thank you guys for listening to our show tonight. Really appreciate you guys.
9432400	9435920	We had a lot of great topics tonight. Just really appreciate you guys being here. Um,
9435920	9439680	if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the
9439680	9442720	show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9442720	9447680	but we need more gamers in here to have their voices heard. Um, a nice five star review on a
9447680	9452960	site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show. It goes an awful long way. Um, hosting on
9452960	9457600	your Twitch channel, whether you're here live or not, um, it goes a long way and is super
9457600	9461600	appreciated. Just type slash host a VOG network in your own chat. Actually you want to add it to
9461600	9465360	your auto host list is even better because the slash command just does it one time. Um,
9466160	9469440	but yeah, thank you guys for being here. If you feel so inclined, we have a shop,
9469520	9476320	vognetwork.com slash shop. Um, and, um, yeah. Uh, thank you just for being a part of this and all
9476320	9481360	the great comments and nice things you had to say tonight. Really appreciate you. Um, let's go
9481360	9488240	around and get everybody's final thoughts. Um, I will start tonight because somebody did a redeem
9488240	9493200	with a post show shout out. So technically it's supposed to be after the show, but I just have to
9493200	9500240	read it now. Uh, fat ninja DM redeemed this, uh, earlier and said, as always you guys and gals
9500240	9505280	from the VOG network, knock it out of the park every week. I stepped away from podcast for years
9505280	9510480	and then got back into it. And OLR was the first podcast I started looking for. If I could describe
9510480	9516720	OLR in one word, it would be timeless. OLR always adjust to the video game and social landscape.
9516720	9521120	Can't gush about you guys and gals enough. Keep doing what you're doing much love and respect.
9521120	9526160	Thank you so much for that. And it was funny. Yeah. I have heard something along the line,
9526160	9531520	not, not quite. You put it very, very kindly and very complimentary, but I have heard the whole,
9531520	9537280	um, I, I, uh, I was randomly looking up orange lounge radio. Cause I remembered listening to
9537280	9545120	that in the DDR freak days. You guys are still going. Dang. That's that's usually what they're
9545120	9551440	still going. The fuck? Yeah. It's usually the reaction I hear. So, um, thank you for putting
9551440	9557920	it a lot nicer. Although I appreciate everyone that discovers the show. I hope you're not too
9557920	9564000	disappointed. We don't exclusively talk about DDR music games anymore. We still love those games an
9564000	9570160	awful lot. Trust. So, all right. Yeah. Bobby Blackwell. When I meet people, they say, yeah,
9570160	9574960	I used to listen to you 15 years ago. Yeah. I have many former listeners. Yeah. Same,
9574960	9580560	same. If we show up at a convention or something, it'll be like, I, when I first got my iPhone,
9580560	9587120	I downloaded you. And then it's like, what'd you do after that? Oh, I unsubscribed. Oh, okay.
9587680	9593680	Tea. It's it's fine. It's fine. I understand. Look, as long as you're supporting an independent
9593680	9599680	broadcaster or broadcast team somewhere and supporting independent voices, um, you know,
9599680	9604640	celebrities are really taking over podcasting. And look, sometimes that's a cool thing. I like
9604640	9609600	the Trixie and Katya podcast. Okay. I'm going to listen to that Lori Beth Denver podcast. I get it.
9609600	9614480	But at the same time, it is so important to support our indie scene as well. And these
9614480	9619360	people, you know, really working hard, uh, from, from the love of the games and the industry and
9619360	9625760	so much, um, out of their spare bedrooms on Skype or discord where a stream yard is another big one
9625760	9630400	or wherever they are. Um, it just support your indie friends and indie podcasters. It means a
9630400	9637440	lot. Okay. Um, sorry. That was a very long final thought, but, um, I had to do it. So Loki,
9637440	9641120	how about you? How's your, what's your final thought? Uh, final thought is, like I said,
9641120	9647280	uh, I'm hoping that my second episode of my, um, YouTube series done today and then episode
9647280	9652880	three be becoming much sooner. I've been making the mistake of doing too much in between stuff.
9652880	9658640	So I planning things out a little bit better. So, uh, I've already got what's going to be in
9658640	9664960	episode three and so they'll become much sooner. So look forward to that. Nice orange ride and
9664960	9669680	chat says orange launch radio, my source of vital information. Thank you. Maybe that'll be the
9669680	9674080	future tagline. All right. Uh, Dar soccer last, but certainly not least your final thought.
9674880	9679520	Stay tuned. I'm going to be doing some dead by daylight and hopefully not screwing up with my
9679520	9685280	new mouse. So we'll see. Oh, you changed that. I forgot that you got a new mouse. Oh,
9685280	9689440	I haven't started using it yet. So I'm probably going to try it on stream. I just,
9689440	9692880	I've been using a thumb track ball and I'm actually starting to get like some repetitive
9692880	9700160	thumb problems. Oh, so, um, that, and if you ever watch any of my streams or my clips, you'll see
9700640	9705680	it's kind of jerky. Yeah. Yeah. I could tell your track ball was doing that. So I'm actually
9705680	9710320	excited for you to see how that might improve, um, by having the mouse now. It'll be interesting.
9710320	9715760	Yeah, we'll see. So, um, so yeah, I'm going to go ahead and drop out for now. Yep. But,
9715760	9721280	um, have a good night, everybody. I hope to see you in, in stream and, uh, don't text me
9721280	9724240	when I'm trying to do the readouts. You'll get the rate in like four minutes. Okay.
9725200	9729600	Uh, I, I will let me know when you're ready and I'll let you know if I'm out of the,
9730480	9736720	okay. Okay. You got it. All right. Later kids. All right. Um, on that note, I will say good night to
9736720	9741200	everybody. I'm here at orange launch radio. Um, of course, for those listening live, we'll be back
9741200	9745520	after the credits as we usually are just to do some final shout outs. Um, but for everybody out
9745520	9751120	there, podcast feed and live reminder, we're taken next week off Rob wants a vacation. Um,
9751200	9756560	so have a good, it's weird to say happy Memorial day. Cause it's not exactly a happy, but I want
9756560	9763600	to just say, you know, have a good long weekend. Um, you know, it's been a crazy year and a half.
9763600	9767440	And I think a lot of people are going to be able to do, even if things aren't back to normal yet,
9767440	9771040	and they shouldn't be completely normal. I think a lot of us are going to get to do things where
9771040	9774720	we get like a taste of that back, you know, talk about mental health and all that. A lot of us
9774720	9778400	are going to get to get, get a taste, see some people that are also vaccinated that we haven't
9778400	9783040	seen in a long time and all that stuff. I hope this Memorial day is a good one, uh, for many
9783040	9787520	of you out there. And if you want to stay home all weekend and play video games, you know what,
9787520	9792720	that is fine too. Have a great time doing it. We'll see you in 14 days with another new episode
9792720	9798400	of orange launch radio until then have a great week. Um, Bobby may still be holding the Fort
9798400	9803200	down next week. It all depends on if it's raining in Georgia or not. So, uh, stay tuned to our
