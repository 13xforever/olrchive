{"text": " The console arm trace continues to be interesting, since graphics quality can no longer grow as dramatically as it did generation over generation. Xbox rode the wave of Kinect across two generations, but as of the series generation they have no extra piece of gaming tech, while rumors say that Sony's PSVR2 or PS5VR will be impressive, challenging even today's VR headsets. The story of consoles never ends, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about it and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight with episode number 869 of our show for this May the 18th, no 16th of 2021 I can't read my own numbers. Hi I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co-hosts say hello as always to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi how are you? I've had a long day but a fairly good day. Yeah. I went to one of my favorite places to eat and loaded up on, finally they're back to having the pink garlic sauce at Pita Kitchen. Nice. Just saying. Oh I don't think that was there. Sumac is delicious. Yeah, yeah one of our favorite local little restaurants. We are based in Sacramento, California so sometimes it's, and all three of us live in the area, we live in the suburbs if nothing else, and so sometimes we can't avoid the local chat such as favorite restaurants, but if you happen to be local and you know this place Pita Kitchen, I was just telling Jamie before the show, Alan and I were there like a week and a half ago and it was it was marvelous and it's a small little restaurant you know it's like a small team that runs it so I'm really glad they're still around that's for sure. Absolutely but you know we they had some different stuff there in their little grocery store and I picked up some spinach and cheese pies they're wrapped in filo dough they're absolutely they're like giant spanakopita it's really delicious. Get the baklava because I've had bad baklava but theirs is really good. Theirs is always delightful and we actually got into a discussion on like how terrible making filo dough is and she's like we don't make it. Awesome. But yeah we had a really good time but I'm really irritated that the the pet store that I go to does not have Midniss food nor had they had it for the last three weeks and I get her refrigerated food so they don't like keep any extra stock and pack so I had to buy her raw food. I was gonna tell you we can't even like the food that Smoosh eats we can't even get it at like the big brand we have to go to the indie pet store over by Lomond's that's the only place that will have the food and that's not the closest pet store to us but it's whatever it's the only place that has the food that Smoosh will eat so you should check that but maybe they have the food. What are you feeding him like caviar from a live sturgeon? No it's just a certain brand he's he's a weird kitty you all know that he doesn't he doesn't really care for kitty treats either it's it's interesting so anyway we will get to get look local discussion is inevitable sometimes if you if you are unaware with the history of our show you know we we are the longest running video game podcast because we started well video game show because we started this in online show we started this in 2002 so podcasting wasn't even really a thing yet but we we did get in on podcasting really early it was before it was on iTunes when you had to use things like lemon pod I think it was called to a sink your podcast was like 2005 we won the very first podcast award in gaming we were fortunate for that but anyway we've and I have the award yes you do there it is uh yeah 2005 uh dark soccer Loki and myself um hi tech master Loki by the way I hate to make you sit there in silence my bad but we all met playing dance dance revolution at Roseville golf lands so we there is a local sense of connection here on the show and you know in those early years if you didn't already know the story at OLR we talked a lot about DDR that was our scene and that was our community and then Konami kind of abandoned DDR for a few years and then wanted a seat at the table again once guitar hero and rock band got big and it was awkward but our show grew into all sorts of video games because we just love video games dang it right they're like looking at at rock band going um but what we had this oh you've got better button that's right Konami you had the opportunity and you didn't take the risk so someone beat you to it you blew it bitch that's I that's you know they even they even screwed up their own rendition of that as well considering that they had a winning formula and they're just like now let's put out rock revolution instead Loki I think your audio is coming through your webcam not your mic just you know it's it's kind of tin canny okay yeah you might want to check that anyway but while he fixed that live I'm gonna check our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the voice of geeks Network twitch.tv slash vog network I almost said twitch.tv slash Bobby Black Wolf area for two yes much better for two reasons one I forgot to say happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf on our throw call tonight that was on my mind his birthday was this past week so happy belated birthday again I know he's 20 wriggling day go go figure so for the first time obviously happy happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf and congratulations to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who announced this week he will be an announcer during summer games done quick for the it's his third time at a games done quick event pretty much all the virtual ones at this point so congrats we don't know what games he's announcing yet we're expecting to find that out tomorrow but as I understand there are no Yakuza runs this year so there's not gonna be like a baby thing or any of that stuff that yeah I know too bad huh but it's well it's also at the same time we can say ah but I do love the games done quick like mixes up the games right because how are other games supposed to get a shot if you know it's always the same games so I think that's great um let's see some of the comments speaking of the local chat and then I promise we'll get into gaming news pod culture says how long has it been since Pinkberry was mentioned well that that is a bit of a local place but I think that I think it's a like a West Coast no it is it's international I've seen it in it hurts I've seen it in airports pinkberry in Atlanta I think it started at the airport I yeah I think it started in LA so there's like a lot of them in the West Coast but anyway long story short the one that are soccer and I used to go to closed and Alan also my husband kind of let it known that he has a preference for another place called Menchie's and so that's one of those yogurt battles I just give in on like my husband's allowed a nice thing once in a while and well they also good they also have dole whip it or Menchie's yes yes what yeah what yeah they do they do like a dole whip type thing so this has to happen I don't know if it's official though it but it's their own version of it they I don't think they can call it that but it's basically that yeah the you know what I still think we need to do is that we need to have a dinner at Brookfield and then go to pinkberry well you know especially now that I don't want to say the pandemic is over because it certainly isn't but now that we're getting vaccinated and you know it make light right now well you know I you still want to be cautious and I know there's the CDC guidance and a lot of people are a little skittish about that because unfortunately this panda I mean whereas the science says vaccinated people aren't gonna spread it you can hang out with other vaccinated people without a mask the reality is a lot of us are a little bit unfortunately this whole instance has seen the best in people and the worst in people and I don't trust people to be honest exactly and I don't think a lot of us do we don't trust other people to be honest and that's really unfortunate but hopefully more and more people get vaccinated and that'll that'll do the trick because the vaccinations are working that's it period so the more people to get vaccinated the less longer this is gone but anyway it's nice to think that some of those things are a possibility again like the you know Brookfield's trip and you know who may be going to see what a sad place Rosewood Golf Land is these days and what have you all those types of things so yeah who knows a lot of exciting stuff coming in the next few months I'm sure I think it would be fun to film a trip like that and put it as like a bonus video at vog network for our subscribers that might be fun so you know what though I legit haven't been to Pinkberry since 2019 I haven't been in about a year myself I still like it like just because I give in and my husband gets to pick most of the time I still I still I still sneak and have it I'll be at an airport and I'll be like oh I'm gonna have that so didn't need blood orange back and then I'll go huh speaking of air pop go ahead I was gonna say I stopped going there because I just didn't like their flavors like I had one like they started doing these like kind of they were sort of ice cream but not ice cream and they just started like really weird flavors I didn't like so that's what pissed Alan off to their their flavor selection was so limited and once they would get a flavor that he really liked it would be gone at the end of the month they rotate something else yeah do do you know though what I what I miss hmm is I miss Naya the gelato place that was all in the area oh I don't I don't think I ever ate there maybe once so so alright and I'll get off of it after this but just imagine you have a place that has something like 20 different flavors of gelato and they rotate a lot of their flavors and they had champagne they had Guinness they had whole wheat that tasted like eating cereal they had like all kinds of just different ones and the alcoholic ones were actually alcoholic and I ate a big ol bowl of Guinness and champagne it was delightful no I miss is we had a place over here and I think it's a chain Rita's that's frozen custard yes the one that's nearby all right all right look super disappointed that's so so good look can you tell me when ice cream I get that snacking is important and if if the chat wasn't lighting up going mmm gelato yes Rita's like if the chat wasn't supporting this we probably would have cut it off a while ago but I do want to get into some gaming news because there was quite a bit of it this week I'm gonna say okay I won't even talk then about the whole week kit kats oh we could do a whole other spin-off show on Kit Kat flavors and we might but anyhow and my new obsession is Pringles from around the world all right let's talk tonight our kickoff story tonight we want to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest and you may be thinking like Rob are you giving preference to one of your favorite games and letting it have the lead topic tonight partially yes but even if you don't play Final Fantasy 14 please don't tune out completely I assure you there's a very good reason I'm bringing this up at the top of the show talking about Fan Fest I'll get to there in a minute so obviously the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest convention is virtual this year every other year they've done three of them in person they do a Vegas one they do a Europe one they do a Japan one and it's usually like doing a tour of the latest expansion announcement obviously because of COVID it was supposed to be in San Diego this year actually they're gonna move it from Vegas but you know long story short we all know what COVID did to that so they ended up doing these online events instead so they did that they did a original like keynote announcement back in February Shane and I co-stream that with some of our buddies that we play Final Fantasy with here at VOG Network and Shane and I did that last season not last night Friday night as well is we actually were streaming the keynote event that showed everything else about this expansion coming up and that was here at VOG Network so for those of you that subscribe to us here at Twitch on here at VOG Network on Twitch first off thank you second off you can go back and watch that if you want it is a longer keynote because the translation because they have to say it in Japanese then they say it in English so you know an hour keynote now is two hours and even within they were kind of having they were kind of stretching time like you could tell the parts that you know the audience response would be yeah woo and like screaming and they that was gone and so it would be these interesting moments of Naoki Yoshida the producer kind of leaning in and looking at the TV monitors like literally reading chat as he's trying to do the whole thing you know and and so for what for what it is with the state of the world being that it is he did his best and I thought it was a he tried and it was it was a good keynote overall and a lot of the expansion announcements about the game look great as we learned previously Final Fantasy 14 is going to be the latest expansion called Endwalker it seems to have a heavy Final Fantasy 4 influence because we're going to the moon and they are now selling a lunar whale mount in the game as well as you can get Rosa Edgar and one other one I'm sorry not Edgar edge Rosa edge already of course you can get I'm in the shop little minions are right now for in the game and there's pre-order bonuses I think porum is the pre-order bonus and then Palom is in the collectors box I might have gotten that backwards you know those those of you that really need to know that information probably already know they gave us the release date though November 23rd that's a little ways out I think some folks were a little bit like oh that's a bummer we're gonna have to wait so long but I mean you know the the development of the game was really kind of stopped for four months during kovat so if you think about it it does make sense so when he as awesome as this expansion looks it you understand you want it to be done right of course right we hate it when God they're trying to do it yeah we hate it when game companies release games and there's problems with them hold that hold that thought it'll be relevant later anyhow oh and I'm gonna have an F you for the record we'll get there meanwhile let's talk about some other information with obviously 14 and Walker they revealed the other class that will be playable in the game it's it's one of the things that pains me the most in the world is having to admit when Shane was Shane is right but damn that boy nailed it like he called that the new class would be the reaper class and it would have a scythe and sure enough it was the reaper class with a scythe I think the thing he didn't figure out might be enough to make me play again the thing he didn't figure out was that you get a little ghost companion when you play it and you kind of like absorb the ghost hugs you it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen and go look up the reaper trailer dark Sakura on the fantasy 14 channel it's pretty amazing the problem is is that I would have to buy the whole thing on Mac again yeah that part's a bummer yeah cuz the yeah yeah so but anyway so you you kind of can merge with the ghost and you do special attacks and that's cool they also unveiled and this was big for me at the end I was not expecting it and if you go back and watch the feed I was literally just in a state of shock because I my brain literally did not understand what was happening when they announced male Viera are coming to the game as the next playable race by God male Viera the bunny people from Final Fantasy 12 that have always been like Fran was the biggest most well known Viera and the lore you only ever really saw female Viera I believe male Viera kind of known to exist but they're not really seen but anyway long story short we're getting them in Final Fantasy 14 I've been a big advocate for this for a long time so I was thrilled and now that I've had time for like my brain to process at all I am really thrilled with this and absolutely I'll be race changing to a boy bunny as will lots of people that play Final Fantasy 14 I'm sure so that is a very exciting announcement and then of course they detailed some new areas in the game and soon some new things about the story they really detailed the collector's edition they wheeled it out they have a pin and they have all this other really cool stuff that is coming out so for the most part that was the keynote now the event continued on throughout the weekend and they would do some panels talking about like they had one the live letter that kind of gave a roadmap about what to expect between now and when the end Walker expansion releases like here's the next story patch here's when we're gonna implement the data center moving which is another huge thing about and Walker I'm so excited for that for example like Ziba here at vog network I don't know she's listening live tonight but I know she listens to the show and she's always kind of said a bummer you know she's on a different data center than I am we can't play together but in Endwalker or shortly before Endwalker starts we will be able to do that with the data center move so a temporary move I visit whatever they call it so that is gonna be very exciting and they also do these big concerts this is the big big you know thing when you're there live the concert is it man they did like a Friday night piano concert and they do a Saturday night concert with the primals which is like a rock band that features Soken he's the guy that does all the music for Final Fantasy 14 he actually like plays guitar and sings a lot of songs and all his band kind of does that it's really cool unfortunately because the time difference they were doing this in Japan it was on at like 3 in the morning for us here in the US so I didn't watch it live here's the part okay perk up because here's the part that is a really big deal and had a lot of people in the community talking today so they did the concert and after the concert is the closing ceremony but it was a little bit different what happened is Soken wanted to talk to the crowd that was watching for a little bit and he basically said you know thank you for your support thank you for everything you've done this has really helped me get through the year and I'm very sorry I don't have the official audio I tried to get that working before the show unfortunately it didn't work I tweeted out that video earlier today if one of our resourceful folks like Tiger Claw or dark Tetsuya could like pull that video from my tweet from this morning and like post it in chat and maybe the discord I'd really appreciate it cuz and so that those of you listening on the podcast feed can go check out on discord this video link um Soken was thanking everybody because he revealed that in March of 2020 right before the coronavirus pandemic set in he was diagnosed with cancer and he didn't reveal what type of cancer it was so we don't know those details but what we do know is that Square Enix and the Final Fantasy 14 team basically allowed him to work while he was in the hospital and if you've played things like patch 5.3 there's a really big boss fight in that game with a really epic song in it called to the edge I believe is the name of that song that song was basically written while he was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and that song if you listen to it has a huge impact like that like go back and listen to that song again now that you know that information that is huge Soken's contribution I'm sorry I'm just this is a very heavy topic we're getting into and I'm just like I actually got choked up watching the video today and I get choked up thinking about it because you cannot understate the contributions of Soken to Final Fantasy 14 I have said this on the show before there can be no successor to Nobuo Uematsu what that man has done for Final Fantasy what that man has done for video game composition and all of that can can never be replaced however what Soken has done with Final Fantasy 14 and when you really consider that the project was a realm reborn and all of this the contributions of Soken he's a worthy successor to Final Fantasy's music and I would assume I don't know I would have assumed before I heard this news over the weekend that he was probably doing Final Fantasy 16's music as well this situation I'm not sure if that's the case anymore who knows or any of that um he didn't tell they did not tell the production team about his cancer because everybody was working from home so people didn't know so this was the first time a lot of the production team was finding out about this and so it was it was really heavy because you could hear the story producer going like I I feel so guilty I was giving you so much work and asking all of these changes for you when I was going through all this and Soken is basically saying and I am paraphrasing here like I I am having this to work on having the fans feedback from things like the to the edge composition having all of this kept me going and that's the part that really gets you choked up and then something else to consider is that Naoki Ishida who's the producer of the game and you know a big figure he's the face of the game he's you know the guy that gets out there and does all these keynotes this entire time that Soken is talking he has his back to the audience and you can tell he's he's he's breaking up he's tearing up and after about 13 minutes of discussion with Soken and the team and everything he says I know this is a strange note to end the closing ceremonies on but I just want to say that I am so happy that my best friend is still here and if you don't get a little choked up in that moment watching it and again I'm sorry I can't be here and play it for you guys but it might be triggering to some folks I don't know so if you go and watch it if you don't get a little choked up hearing that I don't know you've had a different life experience than I clearly because I had a hard time holding it together this morning watching that you know when you consider what that this game what this community what this has done for people and and Yoshida also explains this a little bit with that when he was giving his first speech to the team when he was rebooting Final Fantasy 14 Soken was one of the first people to jump up and advocate for him and say let's do this let's go and so you can tell there's a tight friendship between these two and Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy the franchise is better for it so to hear that all of this happened and none of us had any idea and the game sure it had a four-month delay but are any of us gonna complain at this point no we are not because of everything we've heard that this team is going through and what they're going through personally it's like wow now why is this relevant to folks who maybe don't play Final Fantasy 14 I mean yes it's a nice story but I tell you all this and I tell you about what you know Soken is literally pouring his heart and soul into this game and using this as therapy to get you know to fight what is a horrific battle tell me video games aren't art people I mean people that have said in the past video games aren't art or people that mouth we had a story a couple weeks ago about somebody getting mouthy on their cable talk show about oh twitch is just people watching plate people play video games not stupid I dare that individual to watch that 13-minute video I watched earlier today fucking look them in the face and say video games aren't art or the video game community isn't important or video games don't fucking help people that fucking stereotype is done we've had it I don't know what else to say that's that and that's why I wanted to bring it up is that like if if you can't listen to this story and understand that video games are more than video games for a lot of people then you're never gonna get it period so um Bobby Black Wolf in chat said Shane complained complained initially but that was in the keynote I not to speak for him but a he's the one that texted me this morning about all of that that went on and I bet if I asked him again he'd be like oh I get it and he did kind of like during the keynote he was kind of like oh well you know yeah it's kind of the same thing I landed I he's he's he's only bummed because it looks so good he wants to play it now but he gets it I'm sure again I don't want to speak for him but I'm pretty sure he would say something to the equivalent there fifth dream in chat says yeah Jesus that guy talking about soaking I have literally hundreds a thousand songs by him on my PC I have all those Final Fantasy 14 blu-ray soundtracks do yourself a favor folks even if you don't fucking care about MMOs and I get it like it's monthly fees they're they're tough sometimes even though did you know Final Fantasy 14 is free to play including the award-winning expansion heavens work this is like a meme at this point but I'm serious you could check it out the first part for free but you go listen to the soundtracks at least they're so good and there's so many like ways that they've remixed different songs in the game and so forth it's it's pretty amazing let's see and sacred J points out it was it was triggering I had tears yeah I mean it's it's it's very difficult to watch and yeah but I think it just goes to show that like you know again video games are much bigger than pixels on a screen that's for sure and especially when you look at a game like Final Fantasy 14 that has such a huge community as it does it was it was a difficult but also a very beautiful thing to watch so it just it just makes my heart for that game grow 10 more sizes honestly it really does but if you if you don't play it and you're not into it that's okay too I'm sure you still agree with my bottom line and recognize that there's a lot more to this game than a game that's for sure you know I still listen to the old da theme when I want to chill yeah yeah there's some there's some there's some great songs for lots of moods in that game at depth says there's some Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn tracks in theater them that are pretty good yes especially the arcade version has a lot of 14 tracks in them if you're ever lucky enough to play one of those that's for sure so all right so that's why I wanted to talk about the beginning of the show video games more than just pixels all right and kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team for being vulnerable for one and just a well-done fan fest even if even if I was a little critical that it was moving a little bit slow I give them a break because they were expecting it to be in front of a crowd and it wasn't it's gonna be awkward it's okay I'm excited to play the expansion very very very much and listening to all of the music that Soken makes for that expansion and he's they I believe they said chat please correct me if I'm wrong I believe he did say it is in remission um so um I I so uh yeah that's that does does have a happy note there okay um moving on let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games and and maybe some gaming things off the screen too that we've been into this week uh Dark Soccer I'll start with you well I'm starting off with anger but I'll get to the anger in a little bit so um of course I've been playing some Animal Crossing and uh my friend Mika who has been in chat before is also playing so I gave her about 30 to 40 DIYs of which six remained since you just started playing um thank you for helping to clear out my recycle bin um I also am doing and I don't know if a lot of people know about this but on the Nintendo online app for your smartphone um if you go into that and then open up nook link you can redeem or you can like earn points and they have six was six yeah six items that you can redeem at different uh at different price points but uh there's like switch cases and a a door placard that looks like the leaf but um three of the items are photographs and one of them is Isabel one is nook and the other are the nooklings they they really boost your uh uh AHH or AHA whatever HHA score the happy home academy yes happy home academy um and then of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight because I haven't gotten the freaking gnome yet and I played a lot but I had a funny experience and I do have to talk about this because it was hilarious so um I was in Hawkins which used to be one of my least favorite maps and I guess the guys I was playing I guess realized I was you know fairly new you know I was doing okay but I think that they were giving me looping practice because they would wait for me and then point and then they would run the loop and I just follow along and then they let me 4k nice how random is that though like that never happens usually people are assholes it's it's interesting the way that people and this is in general for all games we're talking about just dead by daylight in this instance but isn't it interesting how people can communicate without communicating uh because I had a very similar sort of thing except I was the survivor and for the record they were all console so I couldn't chat them oh bummer um I had a very similar circumstance where I was the survivor and there was a nurse in the match and I was like I was being chased by the nurse and the nurse wasn't using blink and I was kind of like this isn't normal like what's going on I thought it must be a baby nurse oh my gosh so I would just I did things like I just started booping the nurse like I would turn around and look at the nurse and I booped the nurse into which response she'd hit me once but she would she didn't hit me twice yeah so I so that was the communication to me oh she's here to farm so finally and without communicating because again I was with randos we figured out this nurse wants to farm and so we were doing healings we're letting the nurse hit us and all this stuff and then we left the match pretty much helping each other out and left well uh dark soccer we were all on steam so we could chat and the killer was like gg I have a daily to chase for 180 seconds as nurse yeah what the fuck quest is that thanks for letting me get it and I was the one that ran him because I was like why is this nurse chasing me and not using blink and I'm thinking in my head oh well I'm just gonna keep running and like practicing doing that little did I know I helped him beat his quest and I had that as a generic yeah so it's um so I had to do that on plague yeah yeah so it was just uh interesting so communicating without communicating anyway sorry sorry to derail your daily week but I really like that although there are times where if I do get somebody in chat I'm just gonna flat out say you know if they're being little troll assholes I'll be like real mature and then I'll just leave because don't care um usually I'm playing the plague so I can blood vomit on them so that it forces them to leave the match anyway um so this is the thing I'm pissed about so I did all of my reading up on the windows arm environment I am on a mac mini m1 I need it for the majority of the work that I'm going to do I can game on it just fine except that you know I installed parallels I got the windows arm beta up the developer's beta so I could have the increased uh emulation and it won't run mass effect and I have paid for mass effect so I have a uh a kvm switch arriving tomorrow and um I'm going to hook up uh my my pc again the old dinosaur so that I can steam link on my mac okay yeah um and I think it's gonna be okay it's just I then have to figure out another cord or cable to get I'm just I'm not happy about it and I know that they are still working on the x86 emulation um for windows arm and I'm pretty positive that you know it's not going to be too long away and I'm not the most super hurried about it I guess because I have played them ad nauseum at the same time I need my space bird husband I need I need the voice of garris to just read the phone book to me yeah the struggle read the presidium directory thank you garris well I hope you're able to um get that figured out or the you know the emulation kind of pulls through I mean I get it's a newer game and it's really pushing the boundaries of graphics and stuff so there's a part of me that kind of gets it but I also understand how it's frustrating but it is isn't it nice that we have you know now that cloud and streaming technology again jamie you've given more cases for why that stuff is a good thing here on the show than any of us like you know you play dead by daylight on stadia you do you know and uh it's it's interesting to hear how you're using this cloud technology to your benefit in these different ways well and I'm really I'm really happy about it I mean right now the only thing that I I would need uh my pc for is just for for mass effect and if I wanted to play dead by daylight on on steam I'm going to log into dead by daylight on my pc just long enough to link my steam account to it yeah so that my purchases will transfer yeah smart um but I mean I I'm still considering keeping parallels uh and keeping her to run the windows arm because I can now play hot a full boyfriend again um but a lot of the other games that I'm playing are available on mac like uh I still have to play uh uh the second edition of uh homestuck hive bent um you know which uh I've just been putting that off and I'm probably gonna stream that too but other than that I'm also playing fantasion which uh I'm moving into I've moved it to Tuesdays to do my weekly you know chapter so my goal is to get through like a story segment every time I play nice and so I'm really pleased with that and then I've also just discovered a lot of other streamers um and uh I'm really really happy about that and uh pod culture asked me if g-force now would work for me um probably because that's how um amethyst rose witch plays but it doesn't have mass effect don't so again because it's because it's steam linked through origin yeah and so that's where the ea probably wants to do their own thing eventually whenever they get around to it so right right um I mean if ea puts out a streaming service then heck yeah I'll be able to you know the the thing is that it's still probably need to play some sort of uh copy on my computer so that I can mod the shit out of it later well maybe maybe as some xcloud and microsoft's technology moves along that might actually be a good thing for ea because we know that ea play and xbox game pass have an agreement together so that could that could mean something I it's I'm hypothesizing but maybe when microsoft's cloud technology launches publicly that's going to be a good thing well and you know what I've saved I have saved all of my character save files from the earlier mass effects they work but not well not one they did change the save file format for one but two and three will work that's what I heard yeah but what this means is that when I start making a save file for one I can use the gibbed editor and change the way my shepherd looks nice so well you know that's always kind of fun for me you're gonna the the thing you need in mass effect legendary dish or you you've won it the photo mode that's all you need there's a photo mode now you're gonna have a field day oh well you realize I was doing that anyway with fly cam oh no I know I know that's why I'm like you're gonna have a field day because now it's built in and everyone when I'm playing again look forward to the return of mass effecting it will happen I might do it on tumblr I might do it on twitter it it it remains to be seen but I've had people poking me already because I mean I got like over 10,000 followers on tumblr for mass effecting nice so we'll see all right I didn't mean to go off about that and I will never do tick tock just saying all right uh let's move on to loki loki we barely heard from you tonight how was your gaming week it's been all minecraft surprise no um so I've been just more progress on the server that I'm on um dill haven't put out the second episode yet but I've got a lot of footage I have to go through my my problem is I'm stuck in this kind of bad habit where I keep doing stuff in the game and keep recording it but not editing that all down so I need to find a good stopping point and then right now kind of the stuff I'm doing has more of an episode three type stuff but it's been lots of building farms and debugging stuff I've built a piglin bartering farm but the problem with is the normal design where you can separate them by one block because the server I'm on they have a dropped item entity reduction thing to help with lag and so what happens is when you drop stuff too close together it kind of clumps together and so that broke what I have with my farm so I had to um I have eight piglins right now to trade with but I had to drop that down the four so every other one um in order to space them out enough and I have to figure out I'm going to do the other four probably move them around or something but that's what I've been working on it's a lot of work it's all of this like farm stuff just to get the supplies I need to actually do more of the creative stuff um and then there's also the way I plan for episode three is building like an actual shop in the shopping district so I've been working on getting it all together I have a design done for it um just supply gathering right now so that's what I'm doing with the the farms I have um and then outside of that a little bit of orna um that's pretty much been it it's it's the same old stuff um sacred jade in chat is asking what game is playing behind you tonight live on twitch you've got an interesting looking 16-bit game is that is it is ghoul patrol that is the sequel to uh zombies ate my neighbors that I don't think ever came out over here um but that's also something that we're I think it's one of the stories we're talking relevant it is it's relevant to pay attention all right I have never played this one but yeah it's uh I like the first one all right we'll talk more about that later meanwhile my gaming week um so I've been continuing in dragon quest builders 2 um you I'm still in the first area like my gosh there's there's a lot to this game I don't know if I'm gonna get through it um I I really don't know if I'm gonna get through it with other stuff that's released now but I I've been continuing on in that uh playing a little more final fantasy 14 uh thanks to fan fest and there's a special moogle tome event going on in the game right now so I'm really motivated to get back in there and do my roulettes and stuff again so um there's that and then I'm still playing dead by daylight myself as well working on killer and survivor unfortunately I got to this point where like I've gotten my killer up to you know like rank 12 or 11 which you'd think would be a good thing but it actually is really annoying because I there's a lot of killers I'm still working on I have no talents with and uh when I get matched up with players survive I get survivor squads that just bully me and I can't do anything because I don't have the talents to really go up against them the matchmaking in the game is really screwed up right now and I really wish they'd work on that and then this whole thing with the rank reset went totally I didn't even get rank reset so that and some people got like people at high ranks got reset all the way down to like the lowest ranks and like that I don't know why that stuff was happening but yeah behavior I really they need to work on that bugs aside I'm still at least having fun with the game at least I don't give a shit about my rank I really don't and at least the blood points and development of your character always goes forward never backwards so there's that so even if I lose a game horrifically I still get some blood points and I can develop my character and that's what I really want so there's that um and so those are all uh the the ones you'd expect me to talk about that I've talked about a lot of weeks and then of course there's the big one so like dark soccer talked about um I am a huge fan of mass effect and I've talked about that ad nauseum on this program so it is no surprise whatsoever um that I picked up mass effect legendary edition as well this week and I've picked it up uh yes and I I decided to pick it up on xbox one or xbox series x as the case may be um uh that's where I first played the trilogy uh was on xbox 360 and I was like you know I want to have a nice little plop on the couch and play through game I I want to I want to play through the game this way and so that's what I did um I bought the physical version because I heard that the digital version was like 120 gigabytes and I'm thinking in the back of my mind I don't have the bandwidth for that right now like we we went over our bandwidth cap last week I can't and Alan's gonna play this too and I'm pretty sure he did do the digital so we really don't have the bandwidth for this right now so I'm like I'll get the physical and uh that'll work um I gotta say I love the mass effect trilogy it's one of my favorite trilogies or honestly favorite game series that's ever happened um having played the game a little bit I love what they've done to the original mass effect it looks a lot better um the Mako stuff doesn't annoy the shit out of you it's it's usable um there's a there's a lot of fun that being said if you haven't picked up the mass effect legendary edition I don't know if you should get it right now uh and that might surprise you but unfortunately there are some problems and unfortunately this is a fucking trend with BioWare games lately and EA games lately and unfortunately I've hit my breaking point with this shit and that is there's there's too many bugs I don't know if the game should have been released I don't think it was necessarily 100% ready and I'm going to talk about the biggest bug that's annoying the shit out of me it crashed my xbox which you know whatever of course that's going to go right after an important part of the game it crashed thankfully it auto saves a lot I didn't lose too much progress but that was annoying and dark soccer will talk about some of the other reports coming in about bugs and things like that later on in the show but I'm going to tell you the thing that's pissed me off more than anything and it might seem like a little thing but I and I don't know if this is just me being 40 so I'm going full Karen in this moment or whatever it is but I I fucking had it with this and this is the companies and the the internet companies and the gaming companies not figuring shit out when it comes to bandwidth caps and us losing as a result of that and I'm gonna this is exactly what it is so the xbox version of the game comes with two discs one is labeled disc one that says uh play disc the other one's labeled disc two which is installation disc I want to stress the xbox disc and the playstation discs are not labeled the same okay so when you go to xbox here's what I did I put in disc one of course because why wouldn't I I put in disc one to fire up the game okay I'm gonna install mass effect one and uh then uh it installed mass effect one and it downloaded an 11 gig update uh fine all right games need updates whatever 11 gigs worth I don't know okay I thought I thought a patch actually just patched files like actually just substituted the parts 11 but I don't know enough about programming I guess I shouldn't talk so 11 gigs then I'm like you know what while I'm here since I've installed the first game why don't I just install the other two games because I'm gonna play them eventually so I go to mass effect 2 I hit install and it props up on the screen and says we're gonna download 36 gigs press ok to continue whoa whoa wait what what you're gonna download 36 gigs for mass effect 2 what is this other what is this other disc okay maybe it's mass effect 3 let's go to mass effect 3 I'm gonna download 38 gigs what what what's this other disc sake okay let me um all right maybe I was maybe I need to oh I'll launch the game from the second disc that'll that'll fix it so I put in the second sorry you need the first disc to start this game okay all right so I put in the first disc maybe I need a disc swap I eject the first disc I'm kicked out to the xbox menu long story short that second disc doesn't do a goddamn thing what is it well from sleuthing around online what I have learned is if you keep yourself offline when you initially install the game you will use that data disc as your second and third install for mass effect 2 and 3 and then you can patch them but if that's stupid if you're at the point where I'm at where you've already installed the first game and so I thought oh okay I'll put myself in I shouldn't have to do this but I'll put myself in offline mode trick it into thinking I don't have the internet then I can install from the disc and guess what nope the game crashes because it can't figure out that it can't download the game because that initial patch I downloaded apparently patched out the ability to install from the discs unacceptable and I'm sorry if I've blown your ears out but I am so fucking mad this is so ridiculous that this is happening like is it really that hard and I admit I don't know shit when it comes to programming games is it really that hard to just have an option when you hit install that says download install from disk it doesn't Loki you've made a game does that sound difficult what I'm asking for no and also I don't understand why you wouldn't just install from the disc and not I get it downloading a patch but like you would think that you would try to conserve I mean if you cared about your customers you try to conserve their bandwidth as much as possible especially when we're talking large downloads thank you this is and you know what I know there's going to be some people out there that's like Rob is throwing a fit over something ridiculous and I warned you in the beginning I admit this is like a little but it's I've hit my fucking breaking point I need the gaming companies and the the cable companies to fucking figure out this bandwidth issue and I need gaming companies specifically EA Electronic Arts and BioWare I need them to figure and honestly let's say Activision as well because I know they're guilty of this shit with Call of Duty and I don't even play it you guys need to figure out this fucking patching problem these day one patches these 70 80 gig patches because we don't have the fucking bandwidth for it and I'm at the point where I'm not going to buy games anymore if I hear that there is these gigantic fucking patches on day one because apparently the game is just fucking broken to begin with like it's it's I I my mind is blown that there's a second disc and it doesn't do anything now at this point and of course I've I've tried to do the Twitter thing where I've to nicely mind you much nicer than I am now tweeting EA help Xbox support BioWare Mass Effect tweeting everybody saying uh does this is this too not supposed to do anything am I doing something wrong what's going on nothing of course not I'm just some jackass on Twitter they're not going to respond to me who cares but I know I'm not the only one facing this issue and it's just and there's a lot of people out there who don't care because they're like oh I've got unlimited bandwidth or oh I love Mass Effect so much whatever I'm just going to take the 30 gig hit or whatever but like as time goes on and as these you know things go on with COVID and and all this stuff like these bandwidth issues are getting worse and worse so what am I what am and what so I dropped 60 bucks on the game I I I opted to I could have actually gotten the game cheaper digitally because of the Xbox game pass agreement and that whole thing with EA I could have actually gotten the game cheaper I could have gotten it for like 52 dollars that way but I actually opted to pay the 60 dollars so that I wouldn't have to worry about the bandwidth thing and this is what happens I also want to stress this is one example of things that are wrong with the game again the game crashed on the as series x as I was playing through it later on Dark Soccer is going to bring up some other stuff later that I know is affecting PCs and some people that are in some similar issues what's like I've hit I'm sorry I'm just speechless because I in my mind I've hit this point where suddenly some of these things we've laughed at and called frivolous lawsuits no longer feel frivolous to me I want EA and Activision to be held accountable for this unnecessary shit that hits my bandwidth I really do because I don't know what else is going to stop this trend and I don't know it's not gonna they're not gonna do anything until it hits them financially exactly exactly it's not gonna hit them financially so they're never gonna stop and it's more like it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was like if the internet companies weren't the way that they are and maybe and maybe that's what has and maybe that's what has to give in this situation I don't know but it's still kind of weird though like you would think though that it would prior illing because even like just not even necessarily bandwidth but like you're unnecessarily like making people wait to download something and then install it when you have the data on the disk that you just purchased why wouldn't you just use that I would think that would even just be faster like I don't understand what the point is just just so I'm clear also this does appear to be and somebody in chat if you know definitively can correct me from this does appear to be an issue that is unique to Xbox because the PlayStation 5 discs disc the one disc is labeled put me in first installation disc and then the other one is the play disc oh yeah it's still fresh and honestly the way and that's just the way the PlayStation 5 is built with the whole backwards compatibility thing and the Xbox is built and for most circumstances Xbox has kind of had the better backwards compatibility system but in this one very specific case unfortunately it's it's it's fucked things up with the whole patch and everything yeah E3VL is in chat saying second disc just launcher on Xbox second disc does nothing but tell you to put in disc one believe me guys I've tried this every way you can think of BioWare needs to put out a patch that allows you to install from the disc instead of automatically going to the internet the disc I paid for that now does nothing to to do that and I I could uninstall the 11 gigs I just did and start from scratch but that's I don't even know if that would be a guarantee to work though number one and number two I shouldn't fucking have to and I've had it so as much as I you know now that I've got and I've played Mass Effect and I've just you know grinned and bared it through some of the crashes things like that and it's it's a great it's a great remaster and you know what Mass Effect Andromeda had a lot of great shit in it and what ruined it stupid shit that was rushed out too quick and that is why do I want to say it I'm gonna say it this clip this is gonna haunt me so this is somebody's gonna clip this it's gonna fucking haunt me I don't care this is why I am not buying the next Mass Effect game day one I'm not gonna do it this happened with the legendary edition this happened with Mass Effect Andromeda this really happened with Anthem did this happen with Dragon Age Inquisition Dark Sakura I don't remember not really Dragon Age Inquisition worked fine from day one okay yay so more more of that when I started playing it I didn't notice a problem and less of your track records you've recently developed under EA I've had it well and they also need to have arm support just saying I I'm not gonna play the new Mass Effect because I know it's gonna get patched after a month or two there's gonna be problems when it first releases and I'm putting my foot down this is one of my favorite franchises ever and I really want to support the team and I am so sorry to the team and I'm so sorry to the people that this affects when they have nothing to do with it but I've had it period going to chat quest buster says I can echo dark soccer on Inquisition it installed and worked right from the start for me too okay great let's have more of that then great but unfortunately I just named three in a row that are that are a little busted let's see uh let's see RHM087 in chat says relatively small potatoes but I'm a little salty the switch card for Starlink Battle for Atlas requires an update of around 10 gigs out of the box yes not a fair comparison since switch cards can't hold as much data as a blu-ray okay that doesn't discount your point and what you're saying though is that this is an industry-wide problem it really is like we have to do something about this day one 80 gig patch culture this is enough is enough like okay a small a couple of gigs to patch things you know okay but this is too much this has to stop and gamers gamers have to be willing to speak with their wallets and have to be willing to forego some things their heart really wants to give him on and that's why I said what I said about the next Mass Effect game when it releases in what 2024 2025 whenever it is and that's why I'm like I'm probably gonna regret saying that because it's so far out but I've had it I've had it so Bobby Blackwolf we were talking at the end of your show I said you might want to wait now you know why because it's the same thing you might as well wait till they patch the crashing is the trilogy will be great and the trilogy will still be there and I know the industry lives and dies on you know how much a game sells in its first week but that is something that's going to need to change too because I'm sick and fucking tired of buying games in the first week to have this shit happen and going back to the comment on what RHM said Nintendo is about the only company I trust to do this right I may get proven wrong in the future but Nintendo is about the only company that's doing it right so I think I'll continue to buy Nintendo games the day they come out but everybody else can go fuck themselves until they figure this out all right unless it's a Dragon Age game no oh no I won't be buying Dragon Age day one either trust I I am well and that's that's fine I'm not telling anyone else they have to do anything I'm saying I've had it and I'll buy Dragon Age once I hear once I get the validation it's fine it works you know it's it's okay well and you know me any of those games I don't play on console anyway yeah I know and a lot of there have been a lot of people saying that that a lot of people playing on Steam are having an okay time of it yeah but what again if you get past all this bullshit like I said there's a great game in there just like just like Dark Soccer just like Mass Effect Andromeda it was a great game it got ruined it got ruined by all this bullshit and it's it I feel like the guy in Twin Peaks and the Red Lodge sitting there going or sorry the Black Lodge going it's happening again it is happening again I I am gonna say my Andromeda worked perfectly as well from day one so all right I've been very preachy I'm sorry there's gonna be people that are like Rob's too preachy I have feelings okay I just think that we should also bear in mind that for some people your mileage may vary yes that is true and um and maybe maybe you don't give a shit because you have unlimited bandwidth good for you good for you know because I would like to know what part of the world well they would like to be a part of that world they live in I installed 96 gigabytes on my virtual machine and there's a very good play there's a very good chance folks in the northeast who have Comcast haven't had because uh Comcast ended up pushing back that bandwidth cap thing until next year because they were under pressure with coronavirus and everything that's great for the northeast love you guys but what the fuck about the rest of us and this and my anger is just as much directed to cable internet providers and the fact that in many parts of the country we don't have choice on so we're stuck with a lot of this stuff especially in this you know very internet tuned in age where that cap hasn't really changed I think they might have said oh we bumped it up 10 percent big fucking deal I have some suggestions for you offline yeah I know well there's some other things but we'll talk offline about that so anyway all right um I've preached enough I'm sorry but I have I had feelings I got something to say I do actually have something that I want to bring up if that's okay just a quick thing yes I'm sorry I'm just now looking at I was so preachy I wasn't looking at my watch go ahead Darcyra it's all right so um oh hi Renee Renee's in chat who I haven't seen in a long time me neither um but um as everyone knows I'm from Alabama and we've uh talked to uh my mama son before she sang a song for us um well one of uh one of her roommates that there's you know uh my mama son my papa son uh another friend and then uh uh another friend who's actually been mama son's best friend for a long time um but she is in hospital on a ventilator due to pneumonia and covid and um I would just like some good vibes if y'all don't mind just some good vibes to send uh k kitty's way I'm very sorry to hear that yeah she's she's my best an amazing person you know she's one of those people that's better than she thinks she is so good vibes please and please please get vaccinated please like yes yes like I know people that the vaccines are experimental no the mr mrna stuff's been researched for years and if you've ever taken a flu shot there's a new one of those every year as well so guess what like the the vaccine's been around long enough like like just get the vaccine just all right yeah well and thankfully I mean the rollout for vaccines in Alabama has been atrocious um thankfully finally somebody in that house is vaccinated or on the way to being vaccinated my mother still hasn't been she's like I can't find a place to do it and so wow I'm really disappointed I'm I'm and that's I'm glad to hear a mild word knowing your mom and knowing um because I it blows my mind the vaccines have become a political issue and that is so frustrating but knowing that your mom has a certain stance when it comes to politics I'm really glad to hear and this is something I'm hearing more and more which I'm very thankful is that people's parents as their kids are like fuck yeah I'm getting vaccinated people's parents are kind of like coming around a little bit so like I'm I'm really happy to hear that I'm sorry about the fact she can't find one right now but I'm really happy to hear that she's open to getting one yeah um and I'm I'm trying to do a little bit of you know digging uh on her behalf and uh I I don't know it's just I'm really worried and this one hits really close to home because if I was still in Alabama who knows what state I'd be in sure sure yeah so again it goes back to seriousness um and if I remember correctly I think she's in her late 50s I think this friend of mine so just be get vaccinated get your friends and parents and whoever harp on them so just do it um because I know I'm going to be heartbroken if if I lose my friend all right well I I really really hope she comes around so fingers not to be a bummer no it's it's it's one of those nights here at OLR sorry we have feelings yeah I'm just laughing at a just because I don't know what other expression to have right now um anyway uh I will say you know what the nice thing about being vaccinated um you know uh Allen and I are both he got a shot uh his second shot and he's he's through the motions where he's fully vaccinated I'm fully vaccinated we actually went to a small gathering of uh also other vaccinated people last night probably like eight people I know in the area it felt so good you guys it's been like a year and a half and it's like the extrovert in me was like you know and we were only there for like an hour because it was a chance thing we went out to dinner downtown and it was like a friend messaged and said you should come over and we like fuck yeah we will everybody's vaxxed right yep okay let's do it so um it felt so good so I'm it's like it's a taste of what the other side can look like if people will just please please get the vaccine all right I ran into a friend after I was almost past my uh second vaccine and uh uh and he had been vaccinated and I just and we just both went screw it and gave each other a hug and it's one of the first non-friend hugs I have had in almost two years um Bobby Black Wolfenchat says and I can also explain to you why Costco asking if you're vaccinated is not a HIPAA violation that is correct that is not a HIPAA violation and as somebody who worked in the healthcare industry for 18 years and designed HIPAA training for a company with thousands of employees that took the HIPAA training I will stress to you HIPAA has to do with information and how it is conveyed from one health insurance entity or I'm sorry excuse me a covered entity which means a healthcare provider or a healthcare clearinghouse anybody handing handling healthcare data to another it has nothing to do with um disclosures personal disclosure your own personal disclosures you can that me telling you I got vaccinated that's not a fucking HIPAA violation because that's me disclosing it to you and Costco asking that question to you is not a HIPAA violation because they're not doing anything with your health insurance information that's a question they're asking you so you can get through the door that is their policy and they have the right to set it as when I was a massage therapist I also had to adhere to HIPAA which basically meant that some third party could not come to me and ask about someone's medical conditions we signed the document I did not disclose it basically HIPAA is a huge NDA on a personal level yeah one could argue that if Costco then told what you said to somebody else then they would be violating HIPAA but actually Costco is not really they they're not a they're not storing your data so it's a very different situation but anyway we can get into the nuances if you'd like but I'd rather talk about video games right now get my mind off of this all right let's talk HIPAA nuances no no we've had enough off topic tonight all right let's get into past seven o'clock and not even on our first fucking story so Loki please all right so uh I don't know this isn't really much of a shock I think but Sony is saying that they expect that the PlayStation 5 shortage is going to continue into next year the reason for that is the continuing chip shortage and the um the demand still staying quite high through 2021 so basically the financial chief officer uh Hiroki uh Toki basically said that um I don't think the demand is coming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of PlayStation 5 next year our supply won't be able to catch up with demand so continue to expect um ridiculous queues and scalpers yay but I mean to be fair I mean not a lot of games coming out like I don't know it I still wonder when some of these first party like really big titles are coming out there I mean Returnal came out I guess recently but like more of system seller type things like I haven't yet seen anything necessarily that I needed to have day one even with the series x which I did get you know at launch there wasn't really anything that's like oh my god I gotta get this system because of this right now yeah so I I'll have to wait and see um She-Hulk 10 in chat is uh saying it's not a chip shortage they just don't want to pay more for the chips yeah they don't want to their loss is only so much that they're willing to lose it no it's still it's still a shortage because being that the supply is low that the demand is high that the prices go up so it's still technically a shortage it's just that you know they don't want to pay the the inflated price because of the shortage but you know you hopefully you know with maybe the interest in cryptocurrency I don't know if it's waning it's still pretty popular um but I know there's just a lot of demand right now so maybe that we'll see more factories you know or I don't know if it's necessarily the you know the manufacturing of it or the actual silicon that's you know in short supply but I guess we'll have to wait and see if it calms down sounds very 80s Nintendo I'm I'm really glad and I'm not gonna usually hype up what this guy says at all but I am gonna give my polite golf clap to um Elon Musk who's been quite the face of a lot of this cryptocurrency stuff at least he's been using his platform to kind of say in these past few days hey we need to look at something that's more green and that's something that's not like using so damn much energy when it comes to this cryptocurrency stuff so I will give one round of polite applause to at least folks that have a voice to be able to um realize that something's got to change with all that craziness uh when it and look I'm guilty of it too I've gotten in on the cryptocurrency thing just a little bit uh but I don't mind it you know I I've been basically legalized gambling with it uh is is what it is so uh just tell them to stop putting brain uh chips and pig heads and chickens and all that yeah anyway anyway um but back to the PlayStation issue um I will say uh you know I'm bummed because yeah I'd like to pick up a PlayStation 5 especially with Returnal I've been watching friends play that and stream it and it looks like a lot of fun and a type of game I'd be into it looks really cool but I like I just I'm like I'm not gonna fight scalpers and all this stuff there's still that part of me it's like I will get a PlayStation when I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf that then I'll know it's for me um I don't really want to play these fucking games now if Final Fantasy 16 releases this year I reserve the right to change my tune but I don't think it will and I don't think I will so um but we'll see we'll see I'm not I'm not gonna say it as definitively as I said the other thing I'm gonna regret um but if I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf I'll be happy to do that um let's see uh Pele Hanumea in chat says whichever system had 20 million consoles ready at launch could have won the console wars this gen easily that was always going to be hard during COVID and even though COVID is declining as we're seeing it in the states as more people are getting vaccinated I hope everybody realizes a lot of your gaming consoles don't come from the states they come from other places where maybe COVID vaccinations aren't getting around as much as well so yes COVID is still an issue even if it is an issue in your house right now so um yeah anyhow um okay let's move on and talk a little bit about Xbox because this is one of those things about Xbox as much as I've advocated for them uh on the program this is one of those things that kind of didn't make sense and I'm kind of glad that they're going to be addressing this and that is with the quick review uh resume excuse me quick resume feature that's the one that allows you to like pick up a game and go which by the way also crashed my mass effect game earlier today but I said I'd move on um the quick resume future is uh allows you to pick up a game without a lot of loading time or waiting and kind of flip from one thing to another um but it's hard to tell like what games are actually in the system's memory right now and what's been pushed out well the good news is uh the quick resume feature is going to be getting a little bit of a facelift with the upcoming Xbox update this month so you can see what games do you currently have suspended on your series x or series s depending on what you're using um that's going to be nice uh especially as more and more games are supposed to be supporting it as well um they say uh in a announcement you will be able to list all the games currently saved in quick resume and you can also pin that thing on your dashboard so you can get to that quickly which is kind of cool as well uh on a somewhat related note uh Microsoft also released some new themes uh with Xbox one uh excuse me well Xbox one and series x uh including a like anniversary background that lets you uh kind of relive what the old school Xbox look like and uh it's kind of a neat theme I also really like green so um I've been using that theme lately which is um kind of fun so all right moving on dark sakura I I promised we'd get to this I I've been staring happily at this picture of garris for a little while because he's space husband so basically um with the mass effect legendary edition launch um of course people are having issues you know you spoke of your own um but uh a few people are already encountering just some other in-game problems uh one user on uh in a thread on reddit says happens walking around on citadel and spontaneously when interacting to talk with npcs the game just disappears but I can hear the sound and task manager it is not responding and I have to force quit and reload um other people are saying that they're experiencing the same thing um several are saying that they're unable to uh launch the game um and then they have like the the boot going in circles um trying to you know like origin isn't even loading um and you know I wonder if some of that might be why mine's not playing in compatibility mode but then again like I said uh I did by the let's doing the same thing um on steam itself um it'll it'll get to the first boot and then trying to launch the origin client it crashes um but there's other options that people are missing as well so um it only supports the combat and interactive gameplay in 21.9 the cut scenes though all go back to 16.9 using uh pillar boxes um the aspect ratio basically this one I like the term for this they're saying it gives a sense of visual whiplash um and no one has made anything about it um there's no graphical options no forced mouse acceleration no field of view slider pillar box ultra wide um so yeah people are just talking about mods and patches to fix the port so I'm I'm kind of glad that I'm not gonna play it yet um and I'm actually just watching like a little video of people going through this so um I hear myself echoing anyway um at any rate though I think that uh there's a lot for them to fix we're gonna see more more patches and I mean I wouldn't be surprised that even if this is something that's on purpose that there's gonna be something up on nexus to change it too I mean I don't know if these people are playing full screen or playing windowed or what have you I mean there's a reason why I typically play my games windowed anyway I get a little bit less of of that uh that massive change but even so I mean I'm on an ultra wide screen monitor what's gonna happen when I try to play it you know hopefully the modders have fixed the game since apparently it wasn't totally done I I don't know it's just it's and and here's the bummer here's the real bummer especially when I'm talking to people like bobby who is like I've always been I'm paraphrasing what I'm hearing um but bobby's like you know I the way you guys talk about mass effect all the fucking time maybe there's something I'm missing maybe I ought to pick this up maybe I ought to play this legendary edition now that it's in 4k and it's pretty and I hate I hate to say give it like three months because he may not be interested in three months and he may mean you know but but the reality is is that it's unfortunately I think it's gonna take a little while for them to get these problems fixed and it's just like one of those bummers where it's like I wish they would have had it right on day one and I'm not telling people wait three months for them to do all the patches that will definitively fix the game well see and now I want to go back on my uh my virtual computer and try to load the first mass effect um but I mean when I was playing through mass effect two and three um because I think they were easier to mod those two I had basically super high res mods that would work in 1080 right and I I don't see how like what did they reprogram it's the same engine they boosted graphics pretty much I mean they might have I mean the the first one of course was revamped to work on that engine but I don't really I don't really get it you know well they went in under the hood and did stuff to combat and the Mako so I mean I think they did more with that one than two and three but yeah but yeah but I don't know it's just I I guess I'm having a hard time phrasing what I want to say I it makes my heart hurt it's just it's just disappointment because we know there is a good game in there and we know this shouldn't be happening but it does and it's it's frustrating to put it lightly it's like it's like when you're served like a layered casserole and the top layer is like half cooked turnips but underneath that you got some lamb you got some chicken and some cheese or something you just need to get past the turnips what was that trifle with beef and potatoes all right let's move on to the next story which I think Loki's talking about yeah so Target has decided to post where they're discontinuing selling Pokemon cards at their physical locations right now and this is including actually a lot of different type of collector cards because they've had issues with grown adults fighting each other in parking lots trying to get some of these more sought after packs so apparently the restriction kicked in earlier this week they're going to no longer sell the NFL, NBA, MLB, and Pokemon cards except online you can order them through their online stores they just don't want you coming to their locations and having altercations in the parking lot because you really wanted you know some foil card or something like that so it's grown adults I mean what are you gonna do but yeah that's I think they're not the only store too I think Walmart's also been cracking down on selling stuff as well so it's just can we just please act like adults please I mean come on act Efton chat says the summary to the story FU scalpers and E3VL in chat says scalpers need to keep themselves in check Quest Buster says this is why we can't have nice things and Tiger Claw says it's because those cards have gone up in value all of that yeah like it's the scalping culture I bet a lot of those people fighting over cards are just going to flip them online and so they see it as money and people trying to steal their money and when people try to steal money they want to fight about it and this is probably where a lot of the scalping stuff has to get fixed too and ebay and facebook markets and all these things really need to come together to figure out what they're going to do about scalping but you know of course others will say well there's not a lot you can do um one thing I do like though what was it there was a store I bought something on recently and it had I think it was actually Square Enix when I bought the expansion for Endwalker actually um who's who's who's getting a lot of praise from me tonight for doing things right and this is another one I wasn't even planning but I bought the expansion and it actually texted me a code to my phone because it was just kind of like we just need to um check this order I don't know what it was actually checking behind the scenes or whatever but it texted me a code and I had to put in that code but I noticed by doing that it also is making sure that I have a number in the region that I'm trying to buy the game in uh that I'm only getting one that I'm one person and it also kind of slows things down because I have to put in this code and all this stuff so I would love to see more retailers kind of do this force two-factor verification which kind of slows the process of buying things down so it's hard to do and yes I know there will be some people that are still probably able to find a way around it and so forth but it will really cut down their their speed of that sort of thing I think so uh ZenMonkey11 says they can't stop it it's the culture only the fans can stop it and uh you know there there is there is very much truth in the fact that if this wanted to end tomorrow it could if everybody could just agree to not buy from scalpers anymore but unfortunately there's some people that are going to do whatever they want to get their kid their damn Pokemon card um and that's another part of our culture that's kind of disappointing I guess uh yeah Tiger Claw says the problem is eBay is enabling all this I agree but they're making money off of it this might be a thing where the government has to step in and regulate it or at least do that thing where they threaten if you don't fix this problem we will that's what I'd like to see happen if you don't fix this problem we will you're starting to see a little bit of that because I do believe the current administration or congress one of the two maybe both kind of have said that this whole chip shortage stuff this is an issue fix it so there you see it's starting to go that direction so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on talk about something that's happy and wonderful and that is the upcoming 35th anniversary of Dragon Quest did you know that series is 35 years old that's exciting and depressing all at once because I don't know about you guys but I have fond memories of playing the first game when it first came out in America anyway when it was Dragon Warrior and I know we got it a little later but still you know it wasn't wasn't that long after and uh yeah 35 years Dragon Quest will be doing a special 35th anniversary stream on May 26 to celebrate it and they're going to be giving all the latest information on the latest Dragon Quest games so you know keep in mind there's like a Dragon Quest cell phone game uh they're I think they did a Dragon Quest version of theater them at one point in Japan only I don't know but the one that has everybody excited there may maybe there'll be a builders 3 that would be pretty exciting actually but the real thing that has people excited is that could this be a Dragon Quest 12 and there's strong hints that this is going to be an announcement of Dragon Quest 12 of course the last game in the series was uh Dragon Quest 11 uh but that's been out for a little while you know to the point that we're getting these like enhanced of definitive edition re-releases on Xbox when you know it was out on the the switch in Japan and uh the the PlayStation 4 in both regions for quite some time so I'm expecting that we're going to hear what console the new Dragon Quest game is for if that's going to be a Switch thing as well uh or what they're going if they're going to do Xbox parody as well who knows uh we're going to hear all of that hopefully uh at this stream on um I said 26th of May but actually I'm hearing the event starts at on May 28th at 8 30 pacific time so maybe is there two of it I think maybe it's just a typo in this story because I'm looking at a big graphic that says May 26th is when this is all happening so um look forward to some news in that capacity um Dr Tetsuya in chat says I did finally get around to finishing Dragon Quest 11 this last year yeah you know the Xbox release made me take another look at it so that was fun now if that's not enough for you how about some Dragon Quest in the real world did you know there is a Dragon Quest island that is going to be opening actually it opened yesterday uh this is the Nijigen no Mori amusement park uh that has this attraction it's this little Dragon Quest land um I guess you it's there's interesting pricing tiers to this uh and then you know some different rides and things uh with all this it's been delayed a little bit because of COVID-19 but it did finally open so fun I'd love to visit someday um but probably not going to be anytime soon all right Dark Sakura what do you have for us um I have some stuff about PlayStation and Steam so PlayStation's Steam page is live and there's actually something that's listing number first of all it lists 41 pieces of content but only about half of it is visible so that's 41 games and their DLC associated with the Sony division but there's only 24 things that you can see so um the only ones available to purchase right now is horizon uh horizon zero dawn predator hunting grounds and hell divers um days gone is set to release later in the month but um they uh they're saying that they want a lot more to come out they have a whole bunch of games coming out and it looks like the evidence for it was there it's just this stuff isn't there to see yet I think we've got you know hidden placeholders or something yeah it's interesting that there's like you know this is going to this level of where they have like their own branded page and stuff and I know um there wasn't as much juicy news out of that court thing this week but one thing we did get it from the court thing last week was uh the whole news about that PlayStation it had a conversation with Steam and and this looks to be something uh that that could be a result of that I'm sure there were other things discussed too but definitely it seems to be there's um a tighter partnership there and so that's interesting yeah so all right well I think Loki has some more PlayStation things yeah so this is exciting I'm always trying to figure out what you know they're going to be doing for PlayStation VR too and here's some more like kind of from a reliable source type of thing so Uploaded VR had done a kind of a piece talking about the technology that's going to be in the next PlayStation VR so some of that including foveted rendering which for those who don't know it's using eye tracking to render just the highest resolution image where you're directly looking and then everything around that would be lower resolution and then as you change where you're looking at it would actually alter where it's rendering the highest you know resolution part of that image so it allows it to save some bandwidth being able to just render um a smaller section of the screen at a higher resolution with everything else being a little bit less um in focus I guess uh they're saying that that sounds like straight up science fiction that's crazy yeah it's pretty crazy um they had the uh there's gonna be an IPD adjustment dial which is kind of uh typical with a lot of the headsets out there uh per eye resolution they're saying is uh 2,000 by 2040 pixels um they're doing the inside out tracking kind of like the most modern um headsets out there right now uh also they're saying that they're going to have the haptic feedback which I assume is going to be the same type of stuff that we had um with the DualSense 4 controllers so uh I'm sorry they're new uh controllers that they have that have that enhanced haptic feedback I'm assuming those are going to be in the new controllers that they put out images for not too long ago um it's still going to be a wired headset which is fine but being that technology has gotten a lot better than what it was with the original PlayStation VR it's just one USB type-c cable I believe which I think that's pretty manageable um what else that we don't know when it's coming out yet of course not of course not and uh you know haven't really seen anything confirmed yet these are just you know like I said you know from a reliable source right now so it's all rumors and speculation until we actually get some news from Sony but maybe this year maybe we'll find out I'm assuming some next year maybe yeah I would be shocked if PSVR is a thing for this year I really especially in light of the continuing supply issues and things like that um I think it'd be really wild to try to put out a VR unit when you can't put out enough consoles to meet the demand so I I would say for that reason alone PlayStation VR for PlayStation 5 has to be at least another year out um but I I don't make sure bets on anything anymore exactly well I mean it's just it sounds cool I hope all that's true now um some interesting perspective in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network uh Bobby Blackwolf our pal uh in chat is saying um that uh I'm very interested in seeing how this will work with my astigmatism which means my eyes jiggle a lot I haven't tried any eye tracking headsets yet and you know what Bobby uh is talking about there that's not exactly an uncommon thing there's a there's quite a few people out there with astigmatism uh that uh I deal with it yeah and so so what's gonna happen you know is there a way to turn this feature off that Loki's talking about or is it gonna compensate for that somehow or I I don't know because I don't develop this stuff um but it'd be some of those accessibility type of things are very interesting questions especially when we're talking about new technology with VR I mean I I hope everybody gets to enjoy it I would assume though it's very fast I mean assuming that most of these a lot of the newer headsets you know render at about 120 megahertz I mean that's that's pretty fast I think that's a lot faster than your eye can move so I would assume that assuming that the eye tracking is that good and it would have to be if it's you know putting the rendering or it's basing the rendering where you're looking um that's going to be interesting it's also going to be interesting that they sell that data and use you know advertisements like oh let's we can now measure advertising your advertisement engagement and stuff like that yeah that's pretty dicey there's lots of evil yeah uh evil possibilities Bobby in chat says you don't know how fast my eyes can move against my will well I will say this I I look to Bobby to be a voice on this because I know he's a huge VR enthusiast he talks a lot about it on his show he works a lot with VR stuff um so so I know I'm going to get the answer from Bobby uh when uh the PS gets closer to release and I imagine you know I don't think they're going to talk about any of this on a big stage but I imagine they will address some of the stuff behind the scenes when it comes to things like accessibility and what about this what about that you know um it'll be it'll be interesting to see so all right well let us move on and I'm going to talk a little bit about speaking of announcement type of things uh EA Play uh you know they usually do a thing uh it kind of concurrently with e3 because e3's changed a lot and I'm not just talking about the COVID thing but you know EA started doing their own thing across the street and EA is going to be continuing to do its own thing this year and what's interesting to me is that it's a little ways out it's on July 22nd this time so it's not exactly when e3 is happening which um you know there there's probably great reasons for that probably so they can you know have every additional day to work on trailers and things like that so we'll see um I also think it's interesting they really invoke their old school logo back when they were eca of the square the sphere and the triangle if you didn't know that dates all the way back to eca and what the the loading screen would look like on old games but anyway just a little tangent there uh they did announce it's coming back on july 22nd of course we have no idea what it's going to cover or what games are going to talk about but you know you can assume uh new games and all their big sports franchises that's for sure um probably an update on dragon age quite frankly I think it's a high time to get some more on that maybe that'll actually be a thing this year I don't know um but regardless uh there's going to be a part of me that's skeptical about everything they announce because I'm going to be like oh is it really ready or are they just going to put it out uh before it's done um but we'll see we can make our own judgments in July all right let's let's go back to a simpler time you guys let's take a step back and we're going to visit you know this is a time when you had to get it right the first time because your game was burned to a cartridge and unable to be patched really until years and years and years later now we have that technology but not back then uh it's the classic game of the week and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids should be checking this game out uh and this this I gotta say dark soccer it's I did I didn't know this game that you picked tonight this is a pretty obscure one for me maybe I did I just picked something that people might not have heard of um it's not even like the best game but it's it's neat I'll say it's it's different it's different so anyway but please let's get to it so the classic game of the week is called Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch um because there's an ellipsis so I had to pause so at any rate um it is a video game that came out for game boy and the SNES in 1993 um it actually is another one of those games that didn't come out in Japan it's a side-scrolling platform game about a French chef collecting ingredients for his dishes by going to different countries to catch them since they have escaped um I'll go into other editions of that but it came out in November 1993 in the U.S. and September 93 in Europe so it was uh European first um and I don't think we got the game boy version in the U.S. we uh I think it was only um only in Europe but um in 1994 it did get a release on the Amiga and the Amiga CD32 so it's it's kind of a who who knows these games right um so at any rate um there is a single-player mode and a two-player alternating mode so either way you play as Pierre Le Chef and you have to capture a certain number of your ingredients before your time runs out so kind of like a little bubble bobbly you know um the way that the levels are set up so you know you jump from platforms around and you have to capture everything and you know you've got some you know you have basically you can set them on fire too which is pretty fun um anyway though uh you uh you have to catch them in a net and put them into a cage in the level and then in every level though you have to find the net first before you can catch something so once you have all of your ingredients then you get a door that pops up to the next level you will encounter some baddies including germs and bacteria where if you get touched by them you lose your life the bacteria can also turn your ingredients into hostile enemies so you have to watch out for spoiled food hehe and then there's also the uh arch nemesis chef chef le noir um who will uh show up to hinder your process um you can also get weapons like uh hot sauce and bags of flour you can use to stun your ingredients and the bacteria so you have to basically take him all the way through uh various places um Switzerland Greece Jamaica of course in this game is known as West Indies um Mexico China and then France you have eight levels you have to navigate through in each country and at the end of each country you can play a bonus game where you can get more points for extra lives so once you lose all your lives or complete the game then you're given a final scorecard that says how many points you got throughout the game and then you get a high square ranking so there's not much out for like big reviews on this one um like uh game rankings gave this a 59.5 um but you know it's cute and I thought you know as much as we love our our bubble bobbles and various games as such this really makes me think of it but like a little bit of mappy thrown in and just I mean it's a fun little unique platformer I thought um and and again it's one of those games that had the distinction of being a fully uh western release the music was giving me um adventure island vibes too kind of yeah yeah apparently the um Amiga CD 32 version looks really good but I mean I think we're looking at the SNES version we are yeah and it's don't look half bad it looks like early SNES you know because it kind of is but it kind of looks like a port of an Amiga game which is what I find interesting about this selection is that there weren't a ton of Super Nintendo games like this but um ironically one you've picked recently Lost Vikings is another one that gives me that vibe where you can kind of tell it's a computer game ported for the Super Nintendo um SimCity is strangely an example of that but not not as much because SimCity had that Nintendo flair thrown in as well um but anyhow I digress well another one about this is that the company Mindscape uh actually started off as an American company and then uh was acquired by a French owner so it's now um located in uh um it so it's a French this game is actually a French developed uh uh game they did like the the MacVenture series Moonstone uh Warhammer Shadow of the Horned Rat a few a few uh Warhammer and Lego Island so it's pretty it's just pretty interesting you know I it's something that I've noticed though is that European developed games in general like during the 16-bit era had the same kind of look and feel for the most part maybe that's what it is it's not so much a PC you know equivalent or Amiga equivalent um but it's the European well Commodore was so huge in Europe that an Amiga port almost kind of goes hand in hand anyway I digress again sorry but I was just thinking maybe this is more like you can just kind of tell it's a Europe uh kind of developed game well my other thing too is that you know the only thing that doesn't make this distinctly European is that there's no dropping water to kill you but anyway um so yeah it's a cute game um like the again you'll see it as out to lunch but the full name of it is Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch I wonder does anybody in chat have memories of this game because you know I did not know this game but when I was looking for the video the b-roll of it and yeah you'll have a easier time kind of finding information on it if you look for out to lunch as opposed to the full name um but uh I saw like a lot of YouTube comments that were like oh I love this game when I was a kid or this you know so even if something has a low you know Metacritic score or whatever there's just certain games that are always going to take us back you know like there are games that didn't review well on Metacritic that I love um the NES port of Ultima Exodus is a great example um it doesn't review well at all but I have huge memories of that game there's always gonna be a special place friend who had this oh cute and we would we would do the the two-player mode I mean I really didn't play it a whole lot but I had seen this pop up not too terribly long ago and I was like oh that game was cute I sucked at it um and so I decided to throw it in because it's you know the the Nintendo library in and of itself for Super Nintendo is bigger than you think it is oh yeah um and I like to find just these little things that might have flown under your own radar and say hey you know yeah bust out that retron or or the 400 you might have paid for the analog um a bobby black wolf is in chat and being a little bit tongue-in-cheek or sassy asking some questions here such as it says I have questions such as what causes these foods to escape why are we only sending a chef after these sentient foods what happens if these escaped foods spend too much time in the sun and why do we not air drop the chef into this war zone without a net is it Billy Mitchell hot sauce I think talking about one of the foods there does it's on-site requisition and what does the BurgerTime universe think of this development of more sentient foods that's it's it's hard to not make the BurgerTime comparison when looking at this game about you know chef fighting bad food for sure you know you know what I think of every time I see the little eggs rolling is I think of weebl and bob remember back when I used to do the website of the month oh yeah that was back in the day that was before your little uh facts you had the facts on the early days of the podcast I don't know if that was a life lesson or whatever that was yeah yeah maybe I should start giving out life advice again but this time I should charge for it um but but anyway I okay so the big rocks are truffles this is definitely a French game anyway um they look like rocks but I always just call them rocks like why is it eating rocks but they're truffles um but the eggs make me think of weebl and bob which I did review the uh the website and actually one of the the folks that works on it you know reached out to to us so um but yeah the eggs make me think of uh of bob rolling in little nice all right so there it is your classic game of the week out to lunch or um the full name one more time um Pierre le chef is out to lunch all right thank you very much great pick all right it's fun to learn about new games sometimes too even years and years after the fact all right yeah the truffle also kind of looks like a big poo all right let's uh travel around the world and quickly check out some rapid fire news and some quick headlines loki will start with you yeah so as you can see in my background here um ghoul patrol and zombies ate me neighbors uh that's a brand new uh collection that's going to be released now on uh playstation 4 xbox one switch and pc june 29th coming thanks to uh limited run games um they're also going to be doing a uh physical version of that a little bit later on as well um if you can find that and then um yeah so it's going to be coming with the two games so one of which i've only played i don't know too much about google patrol other than it looks kind of similar um they're also adding art collection soundtrack developer interviews and plus they're going to have trophies and achievements and stuff like that local co-op so uh 14.99 is what that's gonna run you so it looks awesome can't wait to get that a nice surprise because these are really some cult fate like the zombies ate my neighbors is like a cult favorite i'm sure dark soccer picked it as a classic game at one point because it's or maybe you did when she wasn't here one week but but uh it's really a cult favorite of uh type of game and uh it's great to see it getting a re-release and some attention again yeah and so there's always been a lot of uh rom hacks out there and one the more um i guess popular ones for uh smash is smash remix which is the rom hack of the original smash brothers game for the nintendo 64 um they've added lots of new characters to the game and the latest character that they added in there is conquer from conqueror's bad fur day also they have um looks like wolf O'Donnell is also in there as well so uh pretty cool to see that in the newest update but yeah it's kind of funny seeing conquer with a chainsaw in a smash brothers game but i would i would do down for seeing that in a uh modern smash game as well all right dark soccer what do you have for us well um you know evercade is a cool little device and their uh their launch lineup has a few people scratching their heads um so of course they have some traditional stuff like namco museum coming out um but other two that have been listed recently the uh jalico collection one and the pico collection two um they are pretty classic but i think you have to kind of stop and think about what you might have played in those series like for example the uh the jalico one has the original earth defense force unrelated to the current ones base is loaded a styonax city connection rival turf um and then the pico one has things like soccer kid and shut up and jam so it's it's got some craziness on there so if you like those family of games and certainly check it out and then uh sony has new uh ps5 dual sense controllers that they have announced a fied um and i just made up that word so you can get uh these galaxy inspired colors one of them is midnight black and cosmic red and honestly they both look pretty sweet although the red one kind of looks like a bathing suit i just bought um but uh the uh the midnight black will be 70 and the cosmic red will be 75 i mean maybe red costs more or something i guess it's that red dye but it's it's damn it's gorgeous so don't lick it yeah yeah but at any rate you know um if you want a little bit more flair to your non-existent ps5 there you go all right all right now we're going to take a look around the world at some games you'll be able to play on those pretty new 70 controllers or 70 plus i should say uh starting in the us loki yeah so we have a game called archaea which is coming out on nintendo switch uh days gone on pc there's another one of those uh sony titles for you uh leisure suit larry wet dreams dry twice i don't know why that series is still around why are they still making those games i don't know and then to the switch playstation 4 and xbox one uh snow runner on nintendo switch void terrarium plus on playstation 5 akiba's trip hellbound and debriefed on nintendo switch and playstation 4 and jonique luminaries that's on an antenna switch layers of fear 2 on nintendo switch manifold garden on playstation 5 ruin factory 5 on nintendo switch just die already on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 and xbox one what a pleasant sounding title exactly it's awesome um we've got uncharted waters 4 with power up kit hd version that's quite the name on pc and nintendo switch uh knockout city on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series x me topia on nintendo switch rust on playstation 4 and xbox one and that's it all right wow busy week uh bobby black will respond to my question why are they still making these games saying people buy them regarding allison do they though because doesn't this i i could be completely wrong but doesn't this franchise keep changing hands because like is sold to the lowest bidder because like all these games are turd sure i don't know if it's this one or like the last one but one of these was a kickstarter i think this may have been that kickstarter game oh okay i got it all right all right let's go over to japan and check out some releases over there uh it's it's getting busy i know golden week was a couple weeks ago we had a kind of slow week after that but it's it's picking back up again so here we go on the switch this week in japan rune factory 5 regular and limited edition angelique luminous luminarize uh in a regular and limited edition as well uh akiba's trip hellbound and debriefed in a regular and 10th anniversary limited edition uh the wanderer frankenstein's creature in a regular and special edition uh and then manifold garden also out on the switch uncharted waters 4 there's some type of power-up kit that comes with this uh there's a regular hd version and the 30th anniversary edition that comes with this as well i'm assuming the power-up kit must be an online thing um because it doesn't look like it's a like some of the peripheral in the box or anything like that yeah it looks it looks a little bit like a nobunaga type of game but i could i could be completely missing the mark there i'm seriously looking at just a couple screenshots here it's a koi tecmo game though so uh and they are the ones with uh nobunaga's ambition so i wouldn't be surprised if it's um related um let's see also on the switch this week we have um that's it let me go to the playstation 5 and 4 and check out releases there mortal shell is out this week in japan on the playstation 5 and that's it that's the big release on the ps5 this week uh probably a little more on the playstation 4 i imagine you'll see a lot of those same twitch switch switch titles yes akiba's trip is out uh there as well and the ninja jaja maru collection is out uh this week on the playstation 4 as well i'm trying to see what collection this is oh this is some old school arcade games oh and nes games wow um i'm trying to figure out if these games were ever released in the states and what they're called it's a bunch of old famicom games and they even have a new one in it um chad if you guys know feel free to help me out i'm trying to look at screenshots to see if i recognize it i oh um is it kid nikki is it that kid kid nikki the mystical ninja i could be totally wrong on that somebody else might know it's kind of what i'm drawn to at first though yeah um a kid nikki uh was i won this it was actually a different game it was called uh the wonderful yamcha uh yamcha maru oh okay my bad so it wasn't a going on game okay uh oh no i know it wasn't going on game uh dark tatsuya says i think it was japan only okay fair enough all right um let's move on uh to the uk dark sakura six things on the 18th is snow runner for switch on switch and playstation also on the 18th is leisure suit larry wet dreams die twice on playstation on the 20th we have super street racer um on the rest of these are on the 21st on switch we have kowloon high school chronicle on playstation xbox we have a rest console edition and on the 21st again on switch me topia yay a lot of people looking forward to that one yeah but i just like i kind of like wasn't expecting that because i you know hadn't really been looking too much at the uh some of the upcoming switch releases um but what what decade did or what year did i pop back into where we have leisure suit larry and me topia well if you go back to the way way back uh the original leader suit larry i'm pretty sure was in early 90s maybe even late 80s type of thing uh and um yeah uh uh the other is a little more recent yeah yeah oh this game's bobby blackpool's reminding i enjoyed me toby on 3ds dark soccer was the big baddie in my game because you could you could make your friends the um monsters and i seem to remember a conversation at e3 or something about this and you ended up being the daddy yeah that's great all right uh let's move on then we have some more news this first story is is interesting to me but loki i'll let you talk about it here yeah so sega i guess uh part of their latest financial results report they had sort of i guess realized that hey they've got a bunch of these really recognizable ip's that they've been sitting on forever that um perhaps they could remaster remake or reboot them um they were listing off um you know some examples like crazy taxi jet set radio uh space channel five rez panther dragon knights shinobi virtue fighter altered beast house of the dead serisa rage soul hackers etc um basically saying that you know after careful examination you know we can remade re-release these perhaps people would want to buy our popular games well they have re-released a lot of those um yeah i understand that but like yeah alan get to give alan a cheap plug he plays a lot of those games on his uh stream on the music mondays that he does he i know he's played through space channel five part two uh and uh rez he's done before jet set radio so like you know they have re-released those two games on steam but how do you not realize like hey maybe this is a good idea like it seems very obvious to me i don't know oh i'm sure go on twitter and i'm sure there are plenty of people that are saying who do i have to bang in the parking lot to get a new jet set radio there's a lot of people that would love love love to see that so um i hope so i'd love to see a new space channel five to be fair we did get the vr thing um but i just haven't gotten around to playing the vr thing yet but i know i know there is that so at least we know it's not forgotten forgotten but yeah i think i think a lot of us would like to see uh you know some of these old sega classics make a resurgence uh pod culture and chat uh quite loudly says just do a damn dreamcast mini ffs we all know what that means so yeah i think there's a lot of people that would be very excited about that but it has to have the little the little um thing the tamagotchi thing you take with the vmu thank you uh that you take with you so all right uh dart to see you in chat says i know people beg hadeke nagah numa uh for a new one but he just redirects them to sega i mean what's he gonna do about a new jet set radio that's right yeah yeah go to sega all right more spiritual successors yeah um going on to the next story which i think this is really cool and i talked earlier about like you know hey more accessibility type of things is awesome and i i love this uh microsoft is talking about something they are working on with speech transcription and text-to-speech synthesis for party chat so xbox insiders actually have access to this which i i think i'm one of those so i need to go look and see if i have access to this even though i i hardly ever talk with people on xbox i don't know what i'd use it on um but maybe it would work on pc uh presumably i don't know but anyway i think this is great uh so this feature is going to make it easier for people who maybe you know have hearing or speech difficulties they can actually read what's coming up in party chat because it's being live transcribed on the screen uh these features are in the ease of access tab under game and chat transcription uh with this on words spoken in a party are converted to text displayed in an adjustable overlay uh and if you have text-to-speech enabled anything you type in party text chat will be read by a synthetic voice to the rest of the party so it's a way for you to have a speaking voice as well if you want um so that's really cool and uh a feature i'd like to play around with i love that i would love to have transcriptions of this podcast available unfortunately the reality is all the services that offer it um are way too expensive like you know and i get you know people don't do work for free so it has to and all these services i'm looking at are actual people working so i get it but the problem is um a three hour or you know at worse maybe two and a half two hour whenever on some weeks this podcast like it's really expensive so i just i can't afford it but if there were some type of like automated way to do it which somebody was telling me to use youtube to do the transcriptions and um i it's not youtube isn't great at it but it might be a start um so yeah i i would love to have that um just even for this show check on some options yeah that'd be cool just if it costs money the answer's no all right the answer might be maybe all right um depends on who's fronting it yeah so um all right let's move on uh i think this one's two years dark talker yeah i was just about to start it now this is already passed so this was actually for friday uh may 14th um itch.io uh held its first ever creator day which i don't know how that went um but they were they went to forego its usual cut of sales um so a hundred percent of any transactions that day after taxes and payment processing fees were going directly back to the creators so basically it was a good way to to put these indie developers give them a little bit more money in their pocket i mean and the thing with um with itch.io already is that they have a default 10 cut of sales but it could go between zero and 100 depending on what the developer wanted to do um and so they take a much smaller cut than the 30 industry standard um so i thought it was really cool that you know they gave back yeah i was gonna say i'd known about it i know i wish i'd known we would have hyped your game more to get uh sold then but uh s is showing her matt does remind us in chat speaking of itch.io loki's game is on it and drops the link there to uh buy pixel poops number two i appreciate that and i sold uh just reordered my labels because they got screwed up the first time so still working on that physical edition all right nice all right well maybe we'll do another one of those uh creators day again uh in the future that would sure be nice all right meanwhile loki all right so um you know this is kind of funny because it's almost like a meme here but uh we we remember the ever given container ship on the suis canal well apparently uh nintendo's switch shipments were impacted by that now i might say though that's a likely story nintendo that your your shipments were this is the reason why there's a shortage on your consoles right it's because of this um i'm skeptical if you may say um but apparently they said yes that that caused delays for the product in europe and some of the uh inventories are a little bit tighter in those countries sure sure nintendo we'll believe you this time but i'm skeptical i'm on to you you think it's just a convenient excuse i'm sure that they'll say that the ever given like the digital version of the ever given is just like it's just jammed into the e-shop that's why we got to take down mario you know in march because it's just that mario games just can't get through there so i don't know i don't i'll believe them this time uh bobby blackwolf in chat says remember that ship didn't just block its own stuff it blocked all ships yes it wasn't just about the one ship that was stuck but obviously it caused a traffic jam uh but like the worst possible kind that went on for weeks really um no so yeah it's just like nintendo always has hardware shortages on everything so this doesn't help but i think what i think when it happened we all sat here going it's not going to help you know so right yeah there is that all right um let's move on and uh get to our last story tonight which is rumor-based but these are rumors that are gaining a lot of steam so you know take for it what it is they're rumors um but anyway uh so there's uh this blogger out there zippo that i guess has got some things right before and it's kind of talking about what nintendo is doing for the rest of the year um and i guess based on his track record some people are kind of you know running with it a little bit so what is it that he's talking about for the rest of the year and this isn't the first time i've heard of this apparently a 2d metroid is something that's being worked on and that apparently it's it's done and it's ready to go um so that would be something if we got that really soon you know i love mesa metroid apparently runs at 60 frames a second but you know as i would encourage everyone else to do don't set the bar high with this stuff i'm not gonna okay i'd love this but i'm not going to assume it's happening metroid prime 4 is happening nintendo's confirmed that someday apparently a donkey kong game from the folks behind mario odyssey is being made it is uh like a 2.5 d type of game sounds a lot like like the tropical freeze type of thing uh it could be very interesting so that is something that's being worked on as well as a new fire emblem super mario party 2 more 99 games uh and um apparently and what i think is interesting about this rumor and one reason why i'm willing to kind of believe it a little more than others is that they go as far to say zelda 2 not this year so i think that's interesting that they're actually kind of placing the bet there that that isn't happening this year uh and the reason why uh issues uh raised from the pandemic it's almost complete but the end of the year doesn't seem feasible but it seems plausible if we want to go back to that word uh that nintendo could announce uh that it would be like a spring type of game so maybe the same release time frame as say animal crossing since clearly they can put out a new zelda whenever they want they don't have to do it for the holidays uh they could do it whenever they want and it'll still sell like crazy and then of course a big one the new mario kart game there is a new mario kart game that's being worked on as well however it may not be mario kart 9 um and the the blogger here doesn't know if it's maybe a mario kart 9 or if it's nintendo kart or maybe an expansion for 8 or something so like isn't willing to kind of place stock in any of those but that there is a new mario kart in development and that that is coming at some point so you know this is what people are talking about on twitter and things like that uh certainly a list like that it's it seems believable enough but again i'm not going to place bets on anything who who called the game builder garage thing nobody so that came out of left field so i think there's also a lot of there could be unexpected stuff as well and there are some things in there that are kind of safe bets again we've heard the 2d metroid thing before uh to say breath of the wild 2 isn't going to make it because of covid um isn't that big a stretch i know i said but it's not that big a stretch um a new mario party and a new mario kart of course you know even though nintendo killed mario some of his franchises are still popular and so they will weekend at bernie's him through some more games uh to make the money so uh tiger class says would that world circuit be considered mario kart 9 because there's jokes that's joe 100 matt saying mario kart 10 they're skipping the nine uh i i mean they could do anything they want you know the the blogger said what about nintendo kart it doesn't even necessarily need to be a mario kart what if it's super smash kart i don't know like but i could see that maybe nintendo wants to go beyond just mario i don't know we'll see we'll see um but i think it will be mario kart 9 or it'll be i don't want to say a reboot but it'll be like a re like it'll be a mario kart's world or mario kart's universe or mario kart like they'll give it a new subtitle that kind of takes it away from the other sequel games we'll see oh and uh the folks are talking about the home circuit yeah home circuit was like a spin-off it was a different thing that's a good call out because that was a good example of something different that wasn't in the mainline games no that was not canonically mario kart 9 um but good call yeah that that was short-lived in my household too yeah yeah i mean i i'm i'm no more physical things from nintendo anymore i'm not purchasing anything that has a physical device because it's just not going to get used ever whether that be labo or the mario kart thing it's just it's not worth it boy we're making a lot of big statements tonight all right let's get to our listener round table if you have some comments you'd like us to discuss in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network we can certainly get into those um and then of course we want to check our emails you guys email us every week over at participate at orange longtrady.com and dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and get some emails uh for us no i'm not oh are there none tonight nothing boo yes we have no bananas and i don't even think i have really anything on drag race there's literally nothing to discuss i'm not watching the drag race down under so now what happens oh okay i'm laughing i have no tea to spill so okay i will get to the discord comments but i have to get to this this is making me laugh as 100 mad is asking so rob how does it feel to go viral this week i finally after years and years on twitter had a tweet that ended up getting like a thousand plus likes on it so i'd say it went pretty viral even though when i told alan about it he was like well a viral tweet would be like 20 000 likes and it was it wasn't even it's weird that's the interesting thing about what tweets hit is that i've had some tweets that are pretty fucking funny that don't go anywhere people don't retweet them i might get 40 or 50 likes from my followers but it doesn't get retweeted or anything so it doesn't really go and that's fine that's okay but like the tweet i wrote that went viral so what it was it was a play on this whole there was some dumb magazine or something that had a feature that was talking about geriatric millennials in the office place that apparently they're now leading tea i don't even know what the article was about i didn't want to link it because i didn't want to give it the hits but everybody on twitter of course is dunking on this term geriatric millennials i think loki would qualify as one with his age yeah but dark soccer and i what the fuck does that make us we're technically gen x at that point not even a millennial though because i'm 1980s so okay so you're like right at the end there so so i i just that would make you gen y i just i just made this sassy tweet and i found um a picture of a skeleton at a computer and i put me i put me born in 1978 reading about geriatric millennials that tweet got fucking like a thousand likes on it and like a hundred retweets so it's it's weird is the answer to that matt i mean i'm just laughing at it because like it's always the stupid tweets that go viral um the closest i ever got before was um like i think i think i got 300 or 400 likes on a tweet that was using the hashtag um national send a nude day and it was just like a gif of judge judy and i just put times almost up national send a new and i got like 400 likes it was a gif of judge judy banging the desk going hurry up like it was stupid like i wish one of my tweets about video games would get or a tweet promoting the show but we all the the reality is twitter doesn't do that all right anyway they haven't found our show by now i i know it's a lost cause at this point um all right so there there's my answer to your question in chat as to another man all right uh going to discord um i've been uh starting to read discord comments you guys leave throughout the week over at vog network dot com slash discord in the orange lounge radio channel and uh thank you tiger klai so you posted that a movie i talked about at the top of the show so appreciate that um interesting a tweet from corkay in our uh orange lounge radio channel that um blizzard is relenting on the uh cloning fees i didn't even know they were doing this they were gonna charge 35 dollars to duplicate your character holy fuck i thought that was something they were doing for free well apparently they've retreated 20 worth so now that cloning feature is gonna cost 15 dollars woohoo i guess thanks thanks for that hell uh dark sakura uh tiger claw reminded me of this in our discord did you see this week the mass effect video that had all the fans talking about what the series means to them and all that cute stuff all the like cosplayers and stuff you should go check it out uh tiger claw linked it in our discord so be sure to check that out vog network dot com slash discord new orange channel at the one minute and 44 second mark our friend travis donovan is in it um he doesn't say anything but it's his uh when he renewed his wedding vows at dragon con and he was dressed us up as shepherd and jenna was dressed up as miranda it's it there's it's really quick it's like them embracing after saying i do but uh that was the thing so it's it's actually in the video that's really cool so that's sweet yeah it was i i and uh you know when they uh when that part came up it was like i know them i know them actually and actually that wasn't the only person i had a twitter uh mutual that was in the video a little more featured talking about um like the gay representation in mass effect and what it meant to him so um there's a lot of a lot of like wow this is a small world i almost feel guilty for going off earlier but i don't i mean like you can love a game and still be pissed off that it's not given the love and affection it deserves we it's that's what it is we protect we we protect our babies uh and that's that's what it is when it comes to mass effect all right um let's see oh tiger claws link reminds me of this did you guys see loki you had to have seen this all the hubba balloon around the calculator game on nintendo switch have you seen this i saw that they had like a calculator app yeah and it looks exactly like the iphone calculator like right on down to the colors but it's like a scientific calculator going for 10 bucks but internet gonna internet this is like the whole like rage like oh man this calculator is the best thing ever it does everything it says it's gonna do it's so powerful and it's like i don't know why this is becoming a meme but internet what can you say they have like like there's like art programs and stuff on there as well like nobody's making a big deal about that i guess it's just silly that calculator's on there yeah whatever you know um act deft asking the real questions can that calculator run doom um i don't think so because it doesn't have that kind of screen on it but but never say never act deft um w04 in chat asks what are the chances of a new maximum carnage video game now that the new venom movie is coming out um i mean as good as anything else uh but usually like i feel like they haven't like the marvel and even dc stuff they haven't really been doing a lot of like this is something the industry used to do that they don't do as much anymore they haven't done a lot of stuff directly from like current movies it's like the avengers exists in its own universe in the games now and it's not just a port of the movies right some spider-man skins maybe and that's about it yeah that's probably it but again never say never all right um let's see never ever never ever sj100 matt and discord with a big headline we didn't get to tonight uh bobby talked about it a little more on his show but it's the whole hubble about starfield from bethesda is going to be exclusive to xbox and pc uh originally uh it was thought that this game was going to be exclusive to sony but is anyone surprised that microsoft bought bethesda and now this game is going to be exclusive it'll probably be just like a timed exclusive maybe well i don't know if it's gonna be a complete exclusive i want some of that money it is suggesting that it is a complete exclusive and it's going to show up at this e3 and it will release in 2022 nice so uh we'll see hope it doesn't suck i'm more interested in the uh new uh sky or new skyrim new elder scrolls game whenever that comes out yeah all right um i think uh let me see if i can get through a couple more of these but first let me go to uh loki and get some last minute stories and then i'll do a couple more discard discord yeah i don't got any of those what all right um looked there wasn't really anything worth covering i'm sorry i want to say marcus in our discord uh shared that article about the ps2 exploit that talks about uh certain versions of the system being region free you have to scroll up a bit because he posted it on may 10th but i know that came up on a previous episode of the show um so there is that um going back okay well here i got something um so ebay is banning the sale of adult video games so they're going to be implementing a new adult items policy on june 15th and they're going to be you know blocking anything that's basically unrated you know triple x x um also explicit uh comics books films animation manga hentai yaoi um i don't know if it that necessarily applies to video games though but maybe if it's unrated so sorry no bmx triple x uh used or i guess you're not gonna find that anymore you have to go to the facebook marketplace for that we have to steal it online like a lot of people do these days not that you should do that now you should do that but sometimes when it comes to games preservation we're left with minimal choices all right i want to mention this in chat so bobby blackwolf in chat is talking about this and dark soccer this is up your alley um literally in a way uh was this was there something earlier about mandalorian pinball no i didn't bring it up because you did bobby so we we don't always have to talk about the same things but uh dark soccer of course is a pinball geek so i think the world wants to know her reactions you're not getting it bobby is so you can fly to atlanta and play to his house there's already a bunch of people who are like selling their pre-orders on ebay that well it's probably because there's the whole like three editions right you talked about a black knight table recently that had this whole thing there's like a limited edition a extra edition the same thing's going on with the mandalorian yeah well the thing the the big thing is is that we just got a new to us uh pinball anyway we have uh the jersey jack guns and roses oh cool yeah it's really cool i actually i actually kind of like it i want to come over and play pinball come over yay all right let's play come over tomorrow uh maybe don't you stream on mondays no alan's yes oh i actually stream on mondays earlier oh well yeah after the show and all that but yeah yeah all right after what show the the one we're on tomorrow oh tomorrow well i thought i thought i'd do tonight i do monday and i do tuesday okay all right i'm so confused all right uh at some point it doesn't have to be tomorrow just whenever uh come over and play pinball um and then in in uh september hopefully uh enough people get vaccinated where dragon con can be a thing and uh even if it's a little even if it's a downscaled show this year which i'm expecting that might be the case they'll probably still have dragon con but they're probably going to do some things to try to not have people gather quite in mass as they do but i don't know i at the same time my perception's fucked because i'm in california not georgia and my understanding is things are very different out there so it might just be the same old dragon con we'll see but i i know the folks behind it will not have it if they don't think it's going to be safe i have that trust because i know there's people many people in atlanta who work at the cdc so uh and uh many folks on dragon con because of that but anyway assuming i get out there um in september i will look forward to playing bobby's table he'll have it by then right i think so i think so um which by the way they changed my flight out to dragon con i had to call delta to try to get an earlier flight i was on hold for 40 minutes and still didn't get through so i have to try calling again tomorrow because the online wouldn't do it for me trying to get on an earlier flight because um it has me getting there at like eight getting to the airport at like eight o'clock on wednesday eight pm and that's um pretty late in the day so i want to catch a early morning flight and get there a little sooner if i can because we have a tradition we always go to that 24 diner around the corner on wednesday night and that was the very first place i took alan when we went to atlanta was that little diner where he drank way too much sweet tea and uh we always go there on wednesday nights before the craziness kicks in and if i get there that late i mean i guess they're 24 hour but still still still still all right um okay i think i think that's about it uh i think uh we're gonna wrap up that's about the end of the show uh before we do let's get some final thoughts um let me say of course as i always do here at the end of the show thank you for listening to orange

that much faster but um yeah look for that all right and dark sakura i'll let you have your final thought um stay tuned i'm gonna play dead by daylight and try to get a gnome all right good luck with that yep all right and my final thought um i don't really have a good one there's there's a lot of exciting and scary stuff going on in my personal life um just send your good vibes my way um there's a lot a lot going on i will talk about it on the show but it's going to be a little bit so um yeah um nothing of concern nothing of concern um okay that's it and gaming is for everyone i think it's a
