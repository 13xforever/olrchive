0	13720	Years ago, Google's big priority was Google+, and news reports stated that Google execs
13720	17120	and management were incentivizing staff to integrate Google Plus into all their products
17120	18320	as quickly as possible.
18320	22000	Well, their bread and butter service, Search Everywhere and Everything, is finally coming
22000	24600	to Stadia one year and six months after its release.
24600	27800	I guess it wasn't as important because there's no ads in the Stadia interface.
27800	29320	That's Mike Fetch for this week.
29320	32720	Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of
32720	36280	the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36280	43800	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
43800	45600	every gamer has a voice.
45600	52480	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again tonight, May the 2nd of
52480	57040	2021 with episode number 867 of our show.
57040	63120	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined every week, socially distant still, with Dark Sakura
63120	64120	or Jamie Sommers.
64120	65120	Hello.
65120	66120	Hi.
66120	67120	Hi.
67120	68120	How are you?
68120	69120	I'm okay.
69120	70120	Good, good.
70120	71120	Doing stuff.
71120	76320	You were working hard last week, so you did a stream after, so live, because of course
76320	80320	we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of
80320	85520	Geeks Network, VOG Network on Twitch, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
85520	90600	And a lot of weeks we kind of pass the reins to other people, Alan's done a stream after
90600	95040	the show, some of our friends we've raided after the show, but you actually did a live
95040	96640	stream last week.
96640	101040	You were playing Dead by Daylight, which we've talked at length, gross, disgusting, filthy
101040	104640	length on this show about, but you were actually showing that off.
104640	108560	And I got to say, I was surprised, I remember we were talking before last week's show and
108560	111440	you were like, oh, I'll probably just go for like an hour and then send it to somebody
111440	112440	else.
112520	117800	I'm getting into bed at like midnight and I have a Chromecast in the bedroom now, so
117800	120520	I watch Twitch a lot on the TV Alan and I watch.
120520	127240	You were still going at like 12, 15 last Sunday and I'm like, she's going to regret this,
127240	128240	but you had a good stream.
128240	129240	I was spiteful.
129240	130760	But you had a good stream, right?
130760	131760	I did.
131760	136400	And plus, something else happened not too long after that, and I really am so proud
136400	137400	of this.
137400	140120	I have to tell the story I've told you already.
140120	146720	So I tried nurse for the first time sometime after that, a couple of days after that, and
146720	147880	I wasn't on stream or anything.
147880	148880	This was just me playing.
148880	153520	I decided just to try nurse because there was some nurse achievements to do.
153520	155800	So I made it all the way through my first game.
155800	161320	No add ons, no nothing except for, what's her main thing?
161320	166480	I didn't use Strider, I used nurses calling the healing one.
166480	170040	So anyway, so I'm going through it and everyone, of course, is running over me because nurses
170040	173180	fucking hard to learn and write it.
173180	175480	And everyone was just being such a piece of shit about it.
175480	177480	They were being little assholes.
177480	181800	So I wait, I, you know, I chase everyone because I'm just like, just get out, get out, get
181800	182800	out.
182800	185200	And I was going to hit them until they left.
185200	188280	And this one, Yui stayed around and like tried to run circles around me.
188280	191400	So I managed to hit her.
191400	195920	And then she like positioned herself to where if I hit her again, she'd fall through the
195920	196920	gate.
196920	197920	So I was like, okay, I'll go ahead and hit you.
197920	200120	But she didn't fall through the exit gate.
200120	202080	Guess what I did?
202080	203080	I hooked her.
203080	204080	Good job.
204080	205560	Right in front of the exit.
205560	209560	And I sat there watching her die and it was beautiful.
209560	212800	You know, it is interesting, you know, and I know we've talked a lot about Dead by Daylight,
212800	218040	but it is interesting how that game, you know, we both enjoy it for, you know, different
218040	220800	reasons and enjoy kind of getting in there and playing it.
220800	226320	But a lot of times the people in it can really be toxic, which is weird because it's a game
226320	230360	that reaches such a diverse audience and that really, you know, strikes a chord with, you
230360	235640	know, we've talked about this before, you know, the LGBTQIA plus community.
235640	239880	And it's really, you know, I was just playing for fun a few days ago and I was playing as
239880	242020	Pyramid Head and I got a 4K.
242020	248680	And as soon as it's done, the chat lights up going, boy, you're a, Pyramid Head is sexy,
248680	249680	but not you.
249680	250680	You could have been so much better.
250680	251680	You could have done.
251680	252680	It's like, I got a 4K.
252680	254500	And it's like, they're just sitting there talking trash.
254500	260520	Now my instinct when I see that happen, I just, I actually sit there with the chat open
260520	264940	so they can know I'm still logged in and I can see it, but I choose not to respond.
264940	266180	And I just block them.
266180	269380	If you want to talk shit, I just block.
269380	270460	I don't need that.
270460	271460	But what is it?
271460	275100	So why do people feel the need to be toxic?
275100	276100	Is the real question.
276100	279340	And this is a question much bigger than Dead by Daylight.
279340	282340	But why do you feel they need to be toxic?
282340	288580	But they're not super anonymous because a lot of times you can find who's streaming.
288580	290380	Yeah.
290380	295780	And you can find who's streaming and you can often find a little bit of dirt here and there.
295780	296780	Yeah.
296780	299580	Well, that's, that's why I won't put TTV in my name on that game.
299580	303720	I don't because I've watched it happen too many times on some of the streams I watch
303720	307640	is that, you know, people will have TTV in their name so they know it's a Twitch streamer.
307640	311460	And then what'll happen after the match, people come into the Twitch chat and start talking
311460	312460	shit.
312460	314980	And it's like, that would annoy me.
314980	317940	But I've had people come in on those streams.
317940	324980	Like I even saw it happen on a LC stream the other day, Losing Color, where someone came
324980	329860	in and was like, hi, I was so and so in your match and I thought you did a really great
329860	332540	job, you know, even though I died.
332540	340940	So I've seen a lot of that happen and I want to make it a point that if I do see someone
340940	342980	now, of course, I'm struggling right now.
342980	346380	I've played seven times, right?
346380	351540	And I will still sometimes if I find that it's a streamer, I'll, I'll find their chat
351540	353580	and say, hey, I'm new.
353580	355020	Thanks for being cool.
355020	356020	Yeah.
356020	358660	And Alan's had a few positive interactions like that too.
358660	361520	Like he, he made us, he made a swiffing party out of people.
361520	362520	So you're right.
362520	363520	You're right there.
363520	367580	For every bad apple, there are some good apples and I think we tend to let the bad apples
367580	369180	ruin it for everybody else.
369180	370180	So you're right.
370420	373540	I kind of put that in perspective a little bit, but I still won't put TTV in my name
373540	374540	when I play.
374540	380420	Like, I just, well, I can't right now since I'm on Stadia and I hate, I might have to
380420	381420	pay for Parallels.
381420	385980	I got another virtualizer and when I had Windows installed on it and everything, it just ended
385980	387260	up crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.
387260	389900	It wasn't any good, but only pay 10 bucks for it.
389900	396460	But anyway I have been I mean, I get, I actually started paying for Stadia pro today, which
396460	399700	I guess I could do with my gaming week.
399700	404620	But it's just, I don't know.
404620	406340	It's been an interesting experience.
406340	409620	When someone's going to be toxic, I just leave chat immediately.
409620	415980	I don't even give them a voice and it's made me happy.
415980	417700	I think that's the best policy.
417700	419060	Just don't, don't respond.
419060	420060	Don't give into it.
420060	421540	Like they want a reaction.
421540	422780	It's yeah.
422780	426660	And when I find someone playing solid, I will give them positive feedback.
426660	432540	You know, I will give the credit where the credit is due and I've only ever once called
432540	438700	somebody else for being, you know, pretty much a child about the whole thing.
438700	440900	And I did gloat at the UE.
440900	442980	She deserved it.
442980	445420	Some comments from chat and I haven't forgot about Loki.
445420	449020	I would get to Loki too, but some comments from chat, SGO 100 Matt says, trolls are going
449020	450020	to troll.
450020	454020	Tiger Cause says, some people take gaming way too seriously.
454020	457740	Some gamers just have no tolerance for people who goof off in a multiplayer game.
457740	459820	You could turn the voice chat off entirely.
459820	461300	There is no voice chat in Dead by Daylight.
461300	465540	You know, that's why Discord is huge when you're going to play with friends.
465540	469460	But it's all in the little text box, which is interesting because if you play on Xbox
469460	472620	One or PlayStation, you don't get, it's interesting.
472620	479020	Only the PC based people, so Stadia, Windows Store, Steam only see the chat box.
479020	480860	If you're on consoles, you don't see a switch.
480860	481860	You don't see it.
481860	486820	So, uh, it's, that's interesting too, but anyway, um, let me say hello.
486820	487820	Of course.
487820	489100	I have to introduce, of course, here with us every week.
489100	490100	Tech master, Loki.
490100	491100	Hi, Loki.
491100	493300	Hey, why is everybody so toxic?
493300	494300	Loki?
494300	496300	Cause that's the internet.
496300	498500	I guess that's where the toxicity goes.
498500	499500	That's true.
499500	500500	That is true.
500500	504660	You have a nice family friendly peer, a kind hearted game playing behind you tonight.
504660	507380	I noticed Pokemon snap is going on behind you tonight.
507380	508380	Yes.
508380	511820	The game that my kids said they don't like what, what, what happened?
511820	513580	What is wrong with your children?
513580	519340	Cause it's probably too boring for them.
519340	522420	They're like, girl, it's not like a normal Pokemon game.
522420	528540	I'm like, yeah, I know it's not supposed to be, but it's like a Pokemon game size.
528540	531580	I bought it for 60 bucks and then no one's playing it.
531580	533140	So it's cool.
533140	535340	Hey, let me borrow it.
535340	536340	I can't.
536340	538220	It's digital crap.
538220	541340	I have a physical version, Jamie, but I'm actually playing it.
541340	543300	So you're gonna have to wait a while to borrow it.
543300	544300	Eventually.
544300	549300	Plus I have a, I have a ring I want back before you get that.
549300	551580	Well, I threw out my back before I could use it.
551580	552580	Oh yeah.
552580	553580	That's right.
553580	554580	That's right.
554580	555580	And I've got the okay to start using it again.
555580	556580	But if you want it back, I'll bring it back.
556580	557580	I don't need it.
557580	562780	I don't need it back tomorrow, but by, by the time I'm ready tomorrow's my day off.
562780	567140	By the time I'm ready to let go of Pokemon snap for a little bit, I think, I think that'll
567140	568140	be good.
568140	569140	So.
569140	570140	Okay.
570140	571140	All right.
571940	572940	Let's get into tonight's show.
572940	576460	Now that we've already talked about several games here at the top of the show, let's talk
576460	578860	about our kickoff topic tonight.
578860	582980	We have a couple of Twitch stories here to start us off tonight, Twitch based things.
582980	585340	And I thought these were both like, so it's very meta.
585340	588940	We're going to talk about Twitch on Twitch, but you know, we always say we're talking
588940	592700	about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
592700	596940	And definitely Twitch plays into the last two of those things, gaming culture and gamer
596940	597940	lifestyle.
598140	601580	There's some culture and lifestyle that has nothing to do with gaming that we see a lot
601580	604380	of on Twitch, but I'm not going to talk about hot tubs tonight.
604380	608340	I'm going to talk about the gaming side of things and the political side of things and
608340	615460	the getting people motivated to participate in charity and political action side of things.
615460	619820	The first story about Twitch tonight has to do with the Anti-Defamation League or the
619820	621860	ADL.
621860	625900	And they did a big report basically about Twitch and some of the different streams that
625900	629820	happened recently and kind of come to the conclusion that Twitch needs to invest in
629820	631260	more moderation tools.
631260	633580	I mean, water is wet.
633580	634900	The pope is Catholic.
634900	635900	Bears shit in woods.
635900	636900	Right.
636900	638300	Like, I think we all kind of know this.
638300	641540	But what I think is interesting about this is that, you know, because the ADL kind of
641540	646300	did this study, there's some facts that really go into this and some analysis that go into
646300	647300	this.
647300	652460	They did a report called Politics, Gaming Culture and Content Moderation on Twitch.
652460	658100	And they actually analyzed several high profile streams.
658100	659100	What did they look at?
659100	664900	They looked at four political events, October 21st, 2020.
664900	669940	That was the day that AOC and Ilhan Omar played Among Us.
669940	670940	That was huge.
670940	671940	Right.
671940	672940	We talked about it on this show.
672940	673940	That was a huge stream.
673940	677540	Two hundred and twenty five thousand plus comments on that stream.
677540	682400	They did another stream in November, AOC, excuse me, did another stream in November
682400	688280	of 2020 with a Canadian member of parliament, Yagmeet Singh and some other popular streamers.
688280	690420	There was a covid-19 relief effort for that one.
690420	696620	So that was analyzed December 22nd when Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff were running for Senate
696620	697620	in Georgia.
697620	698620	Spoiler alert.
698620	699620	They won.
699620	703300	I mean, you should know that now by now, because this was four months after December, right.
703300	710820	They played UNO with streamers around Google, around Twitch to get out the vote.
710820	717060	And then in January of 2021, AOC was back again with Reddit co-founder and they were
717060	720100	talking about the GameStop stonk phenomenon.
720100	725800	So anyway, all these streams were analyzed, but also looked at Jimmy Fallon did a Twitch
725800	731160	appearance on April 6th, playing Among Us with members of The Roots.
731160	734640	And that stream got seventy four thousand plus comments.
734640	735640	But what's the difference?
735640	738620	OK, why am I bringing up all these streams?
738620	744880	It turns out the political streams had a lot less problems with content than the Jimmy
744880	745880	Fallon stream.
745880	751200	The Jimmy Fallon stream was spammed with something called the tryhard emote.
751200	755480	I don't know this and I don't want to know it because apparently it's used to harass
755480	756720	black streamers.
756720	762060	So I admit I am ignorant as to what it is and I don't need it explained.
762060	764440	If that's what it's for, then I don't need to know about it.
764440	768040	But that's just what's in this report here.
768040	772960	Apparently that emote was used in over twenty five hundred comments on Jimmy Fallon's stream.
772960	777160	Four percent of all chat activity had that negative emote.
777160	783680	However, the most popular comments in AOC's January 2021 stream were called were to the
783680	789680	moon and hold the line, which are relatively non offensive things.
789680	794360	I would say not offensive at all as far as these are the things they say on Wall Street
794360	796360	bets about Dogecoin and all that stuff.
796360	797360	Right.
797360	798360	And holding on your game stops.
798360	799360	Stop now.
799360	801240	They don't talk about Doge on Wall Street bets.
801240	802240	Oh, I'm sorry.
802240	803240	Sorry.
803240	804240	Sorry.
804240	805240	Don't offend anyone.
805240	807520	OK, but they but they do use that saying with Doge.
807520	808520	Right.
808520	811720	Didn't didn't Elon Musk or whatever tweet that Doge to the moon or something like I'm
811720	814160	not completely off everything.
814160	815160	OK.
815160	816160	OK.
816160	820000	But anyway, so what's the difference here?
820000	825920	Why was Jimmy Fallon's stream attacked with all this, you know, racist garbage and AOC
825920	830560	stream was relatively, you know, I'm sure it was there with that many people, but it
830560	835480	wasn't nearly we had these other more mean positive meme things that were floating to
835480	836480	the top.
836480	842640	Well, in this study, they actually analyzed and showed that Fallon had three moderators
842640	848920	for the stream and they all seem to be new to Twitch because they were called TSGAF mod
848920	850280	one, two and three.
850280	855240	They were accounts that look like they were made for the stream for AOC's October 2020
855240	856240	stream.
856240	862560	Fourteen bots and human moderators, including a handful of Twitch employees.
862560	865220	These moderators kept the discussion on track.
865220	866220	What a shock.
866220	868280	Am I right?
868280	869860	More more moderators.
869860	876660	And especially, I think the seasoned part of it ended up having a better discussion.
876660	879040	So what all happened at the end of the day here?
879040	883900	So the report recommends that politicians collaborate with experienced moderators and
883900	888100	inform themselves about the Twitch community before going live.
888100	891160	There are also suggestions for Twitch itself.
891160	895960	Number one, enforce the newly revised hate and harassments policy consistently and for
895960	899520	all streamers, regardless of their popularity.
899520	905200	Increase its investment in moderation tools as the platform grows, require trained moderators
905200	908480	for streams featuring prominent public figures.
908480	909720	That's interesting.
909720	915800	And provide effective tools, support and justice for marginalized streamers, including specific
915800	921080	ways to escalate reports of harassment to the platform and access to experienced community
921080	922080	moderators.
922080	927440	Now, this whole study was done before new chat tools rolled out on Twitch with threaded
927440	930120	replies and all that on April 22nd.
930120	935280	However, they're saying this doesn't change the bottom line about what was found about
935280	937780	Twitch communities.
937780	938780	So what do you guys kind of...
938780	939780	I know that was a lot.
939780	940780	I just threw out you to process.
940780	944600	But what do you guys kind of think about the whole like, maybe Twitch needs to invest in
944600	952560	more moderation, even though some people, when they hear that, think, my free speech.
952560	956560	I think they should invest in more moderation.
956560	957560	Free speech.
957560	958560	I'm sorry.
958560	960060	Oh, no, go ahead.
960060	967500	Free speech doesn't count on a hosted environment.
967500	968500	There are...
968500	972640	When you use a service, you agree to play by their rules.
972640	973640	So end of story.
973640	976400	Loki, do you want to finish your thought?
976400	980200	No, I was just saying, I think that more tools could be helpful.
980200	984160	I mean, there's a lot of things that Twitch needs to do to improve their platform.
984160	988800	And I think additional moderation tools would be helpful.
988800	990800	And I noticed some comments in chat.
990800	994280	Bobby Blackwolf has talked a lot about games done quick and some of the things he's kind
994280	998520	of learned about the event, having participated as a volunteer, and mentions that there's
998520	1002680	actually applications for chat moderators during the volunteer application.
1002680	1005840	And yeah, SJ100Matt is saying, I'm sure GDQ has a ton of mods now.
1005840	1011020	And yeah, that's not entirely surprising to me either, that an event that large would
1011020	1015960	unfortunately be the target of trolls, even though it's supposed to be money for charity.
1015960	1018800	That doesn't matter to some people, right?
1018800	1022880	And Tigerclass says they have to moderate the chat so it stays on topic about the event.
1022880	1028480	SJ100Matt says, folks complaining about freedoms being taken away don't know what it's like
1028480	1031600	to truly have their freedoms taken away.
1031600	1033080	Preach.
1033080	1034480	Preach.
1034480	1039320	Questbuster says some streams also set their chat to sub mode to cut back on spam from
1039320	1042880	undesirable comments, which I believe GDQ does.
1042880	1044600	They're either sub only or follower only.
1044600	1045640	They're one of the two.
1045640	1048520	I'm sure I'll be corrected in a moment here in chat.
1048520	1052320	But I know they do that to try to cut back on some of that as well.
1052320	1055160	You know, and I'm not trying to make this about VOG Network.
1055160	1058240	We have an awesome mod team for the size that we are.
1058240	1062120	You know, obviously we're not AOC, we're not Jimmy Fallon.
1062120	1064520	You know, we're not getting that type of stuff yet.
1064520	1068440	But if we did, we would certainly try to up what we're doing on our moderation side of
1068440	1070800	things to stay afloat of that.
1070800	1074640	But I just realistically, that's not happening anytime soon.
1074640	1076000	That's for sure.
1076000	1079680	And Bobby Blackwell says during AGDQ and SGDQ it is sub only.
1079680	1081420	OK, that's what I thought.
1081420	1089380	So anyway, there is somewhat of a side story to this.
1089380	1091500	And this isn't even the second story I really want to talk about.
1091500	1095020	But I think this is important when we talked about because one of the one of the things
1095020	1099980	that was in that report was it was about the marginalized streamers.
1099980	1104420	Yes, provide effective tools, support and justice for marginalized streamers.
1104420	1109620	This leads to another conversation about how Twitch has really been requested to add certain
1109620	1113540	tags that for whatever reason they've been resistant to doing.
1113540	1119180	We know we have an LGBTQIA tag on Twitch, but one of those letters in particular, the
1119180	1124540	T or the trans community has really been requesting their own tag for quite some time.
1124540	1128780	And for whatever reason, Twitch has been resisting the calls to this.
1128780	1134420	My assumption, I'm left to assume in this situation, is that they are worried that if
1134420	1140420	trolls can easily find trans streamers, that they're going to get targeted for harassment.
1140420	1146180	In my opinion, that speaks as a very big negative to Twitch as a platform and how they're failing
1146180	1147260	on moderation.
1147260	1153460	If they can't effectively add a tag and because they're worried that, you know, folks are
1153460	1157780	going to get harassed, then Twitch kind of needs to do something about that, I think.
1157780	1162660	And this report that I just talked about, I think, is also kind of saying that, well,
1162660	1167380	because Twitch has been failing to do this for such a long time, and I've seen requests
1167380	1172300	for a black tag on Twitch, I've seen requests for several other marginalized communities
1172300	1174140	on Twitch.
1174140	1178860	Because Twitch has been failing to do this, other, leave it to the internet, someone else
1178860	1182180	is coming up and doing it instead.
1182180	1187460	A site that has been gaining more and more visibility these past few weeks is called
1187460	1195020	peer2peer.live.
1195020	1200740	It is a hub that allows a Twitch streamer to create identity-based tags for their own
1200740	1203620	streams, such as trans, disabled, black.
1203620	1206500	Those are some examples of the many tags there.
1206500	1211220	Steph Lower, I hope I said the name right, is the founder of peer2peer, who identifies
1211220	1216260	a trans woman who streams under the name Ferociously Steph.
1216260	1227660	So, and in a comment to the blog in Gadget, Steph said, the essence is that people of
1227660	1232500	marginalized identities feel safest in spaces that understand them, and the easiest way
1232500	1235780	to find those safe spaces is by finding their peers.
1235780	1240180	And that discoverability has been totally blocked by Twitch.
1240180	1245180	And what's interesting about this is that she's also on Twitch's Safety Advisory Council.
1245220	1247660	So she has a direct line of communication with the company.
1247660	1251660	But for whatever reason, Twitch doesn't seem to be doing enough.
1251660	1257220	She also says in a comment, Twitch has not done enough to protect me in the slightest.
1257220	1263140	So it is interesting that the community is starting to build these tools, which Twitch
1263140	1264940	is failing to do.
1264940	1270740	So Twitch, and if Twitch is afraid of these marginalized communities being harassed, these
1270740	1272380	tools are coming anyway.
1272420	1275740	So Twitch needs to deal with this, right?
1275740	1280980	So yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, especially as sites like
1280980	1282980	peer2peer live get bigger and bigger.
1282980	1288900	I think it is fascinating that she kind of has that in with Twitch, and it's still kind
1288900	1289900	of not working.
1289900	1291700	It's very, very interesting to me.
1291700	1294940	You would think of anyone that could get it, it'd be someone that's on the Safety Council,
1294940	1298260	you know, get it done, but you would think or at least would like know the reasons why
1298260	1300060	Twitch is resisting this whole thing.
1300140	1304780	Again, I'm left to assume Twitch is worried about, you know, oh, they're going to get
1304780	1305780	targeted.
1305780	1310380	Well, the community is really, you know, demanding this so that people can kind of find their
1310380	1311380	tribe, right?
1311380	1315020	And find the streamers that are of interest to them or streamers that they can relate
1315020	1316460	to and so forth.
1316460	1322740	So I just think Twitch needs to prepare for this and not continue to table the issue.
1322740	1329580	I want to say that that petition on Twitch's site to add a trans tag.
1330100	1331100	I could be wrong.
1331100	1333220	I want to say it's been going for a year.
1333220	1334740	It's been out there for a long time.
1334740	1335740	It's ridiculous.
1335740	1338340	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
1338340	1340180	I have signed the petition myself.
1340180	1342780	I hope others will consider doing that as well.
1345100	1349580	Now, I want to talk about something I kind of brought up in that little topic or that
1349580	1354900	little story there was I talked about using Twitch to find your tribe.
1355900	1360060	So this takes me to another story that has just been talked about in the past couple
1360060	1361700	of days.
1361700	1363660	And this is something that kind of caught fire on Twitter.
1363660	1371260	And this is where I saw it, where Bill Maher, of course, opened his mouth and had some things
1371260	1374420	to say about Twitch streams.
1374420	1377900	And gosh, darn, the story I linked here is the wrong one.
1377900	1380620	Let me see if I can find it real quick.
1380620	1382900	So it's thanks.
1382900	1384900	Yeah.
1384900	1385900	Who cares?
1385900	1386900	I know.
1386900	1390900	Well, Bill Maher doesn't think I'm cool.
1390900	1392900	What's my life worth anymore?
1392900	1395900	I'm going to explain why.
1395900	1397900	Let's get the story here first, though.
1402900	1403900	Do you want me to?
1403900	1404900	Yeah, yeah.
1404900	1405900	Could you?
1405900	1406900	Because mine's not coming up.
1406900	1407900	Sorry.
1407900	1408900	Live radio fail.
1408900	1409900	Sorry.
1409900	1410900	Yeah, no problem.
1410900	1418900	Bill Maher basically was kind of commenting on, you know, what Twitch viewers, you know,
1418900	1421900	have what he thinks of Twitch viewers, basically.
1421900	1425900	So I don't know is on his real time with Bill Maher show.
1425900	1430900	And he was saying, let's see that.
1430900	1437900	Gosh, I'm sorry, this like it scrolled everything way down the page here.
1437900	1445900	So basically discussing technological literacy, he was comparing comparing 80 year olds who
1445900	1450900	can't use phones to younger people who won't get off of theirs.
1450900	1456900	And then talking about I guess he made a comment about Twitch saying that I just think people
1456900	1459900	watching other people playing video games is a waste of fucking time.
1459900	1460900	Yes.
1460900	1462900	That was the that was your opinion.
1462900	1463900	Cool.
1463900	1464900	Yeah.
1464900	1467900	He said, I just think people watching other people playing video games is a fucking waste
1467900	1468900	of time.
1468900	1473900	Now, look, we could sit here and rattle on for an hour about how Bill Maher is old and
1473900	1475900	out of touch with a comment like that.
1475900	1480900	And look, I there's there's that popular school of thought that a comment like that is only
1480900	1482900	made to get that type of attention.
1482900	1486900	And that is exactly what he's getting on Twitch right now is everybody.
1486900	1490900	And I've been guilty of this, too, is, quote, replying the clip of him from his TV show
1490900	1494900	and dunking on him with with the replies and so forth.
1494900	1497900	Here's the thing, though.
1497900	1500900	Obviously, there are people like that, and I don't want to have a discussion about what
1500900	1501900	an idiot Bill Maher is.
1501900	1502900	I don't I don't really care.
1502900	1508900	OK, let's have a discussion about the comment itself and how there are a lot of people out
1508900	1511900	there, because it wasn't just that Bill Maher said it.
1511900	1515900	It was that the audience in the studio started applauding and all this other stuff.
1515900	1516900	Right.
1516900	1521900	So there is, folks, and maybe because Bill Maher is of a certain age in the 60s or 70s
1521900	1522900	or whatever, I don't even know how old he is.
1522900	1524900	Is he in his low 70s, late 60s probably?
1524900	1525900	I have no idea.
1525900	1526900	I don't know.
1526900	1527900	Who cares?
1527900	1531900	He's he's I think it might speak to sort of like maybe a certain generation that doesn't
1531900	1535900	quite get what Twitch like really is about.
1535900	1540900	But the reality is, while I'm looking at a story like this about him dunking on Twitch
1540900	1543900	and I don't understand what's exciting about watching other people fucking play video games,
1543900	1547900	I'm looking at another story over here that's talking about the Oscars last week being the
1547900	1550900	lowest rated Oscars ever.
1550900	1552900	OK, it's the lowest.
1552900	1556900	They didn't do it in the same time frame they usually do the movies.
1556900	1558900	You know, people have been going to movies for the past year.
1558900	1560900	So it's been a weird year.
1560900	1562900	The pandemic kind of changed the Oscars.
1562900	1564900	All of that stuff right played into it.
1564900	1568900	But the story that I was reading over there was that there's there's things go at Twitch
1568900	1572900	had more people watching it than were watching the Oscars.
1572900	1577900	And that's the very real nature of this world that we live in now is that this homemade
1577900	1582900	content is starting to give a lot of this produced content a run for its money.
1582900	1587900	So I would say there's certainly a part of Bill Maher that feels threatened by what's happening
1587900	1592900	on Twitch and the fact that there's more people watching people on Twitch than his show.
1592900	1596900	Right. And he should feel threatened because the gaming industry is way bigger than the
1596900	1597900	television industry anyways.
1597900	1600900	And I mean, honestly, his his show is probably pretty niche.
1600900	1604900	So it's just, you know, that's fine.
1604900	1609900	Make your comment and get some exposure because, you know, really it comes down to like,
1609900	1614900	oh, yeah, I forgot Bill Maher was even a person that existed and had a show.
1614900	1617900	So now now I remember that. So I don't know.
1617900	1626900	I mean, I guess no, you know, no press coverage is better than any press coverage is better than no press coverage.
1627900	1630900	So. I don't really care.
1630900	1636900	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, oh, God, there was an amazing tweet that showed the ratings for the Oscars versus the Game Awards.
1636900	1640900	And the picture was the dude saying, fuck the Oscars or at the Oscars.
1640900	1643900	One small problem with that tweet, because I saw it, too.
1643900	1651900	It considered the Oscars day after ratings in the US versus the Game Awards globally.
1651900	1655900	So there was a little bit of apples to oranges going on there.
1655900	1661900	However, I don't want to like I don't want to what if what about ism the whole thing,
1661900	1665900	because I think it still does make a point that the Game Awards are growing.
1665900	1667900	The Oscars are shrinking. Okay.
1667900	1675900	I think that is still a very clear point that can be made no matter what the numbers actually boil down to in that whole scenario.
1675900	1684900	And, you know, again, take this to what, you know, that guy said about Twitch and who wants to watch people fucking play video games.
1684900	1688900	Well, let me ask you this. And actually, Jamie, I'm going to pick on you a little bit.
1688900	1690900	Well, no, I'm not going to pick on you.
1690900	1696900	But I just I have noticed, especially in the past couple of weeks since you've started getting into Dead by Daylight fandom,
1696900	1705900	I can't watch people streaming Dead by Daylight anymore without seeing you in the chat room, which is great because we have similar.
1705900	1710900	I know. I love it. I love it. But I think I've turned you into a couple.
1710900	1713900	You have no. And I love it. I'm not I'm not shading that whatsoever.
1713900	1719900	But I do notice, Dark Soccer, I feel like you're more actively participating in Twitch these last few weeks.
1719900	1721900	I don't know if this is true. Tell me if I'm wrong.
1721900	1726900	You've probably been more actively participating in Twitch in the last month than you have any other month.
1726900	1733900	Yeah, I would say so, because I actually am really enjoying the people with whom I'm interacting.
1733900	1735900	So, yeah, you're getting to my question.
1735900	1744900	So my question is, are you spending hours watching Losing Color because you want to watch Losing Color play video games?
1744900	1754900	Half of it. I mean, right now I'm watching a lot of good Dead by Daylight streamers for educational purposes so I can see what they do and get better.
1754900	1760900	Of course, I'm also watching a lot of survivors so I can see what survivors do so I know how to counter it.
1760900	1769900	But the other half has to do with that general personality like I, I, during lunch one day I was watching some, some girl play.
1769900	1776900	And it was just like she just wasn't interesting and she had this big superiority complex and whatnot like okay I'm done with you. I don't care.
1776900	1786900	These others are personable, no matter how many followers they have, they're gracious about their followers. They thank them for the smallest donation.
1786900	1801900	And even you know, last night when I was in Putin's stream. I, you know, one of the first things I do when I hop in is I just sort of go ahead, if I'm not hosting somebody I'll go and say okay slash host, you know, whatever channel I'm watching.
1801900	1815900	And he's like, I knew you were in here because I heard the host notification and I was like, Yeah, but you know, but I think that that part of it is, is watching those gracious gracious streamers.
1815900	1823900	Who are entertaining and personable at the same time that they're playing the game. Yeah.
1823900	1836900	And they interact. They don't just ignore their chat, and they they're, they end up coming up with inside jokes for their community on all this, you know, stuff that, you know, like, what was that thing I go piss girl.
1837900	1850900	stream, which you wouldn't understand if you didn't watch that I keep bringing up the same streamer and I know he's a very, very big popular player on dead by daylight, and just, they create their own like cultures and you know, here at Vogue Network and I've
1850900	1862900	always talked about this we're very like we don't have a huge audience but we have a nice sized one, and we've created quite an environment here for you guys. What, what makes you watch us, we're not playing video games here at all.
1862900	1873900	And I'd like to think it's because we have a good time and what we talked about and that whole where OLR started is that you know we started at the dining room, or excuse me the restaurant table.
1873900	1889900	After playing DDR at Roseville Golf Land, sitting around just talking about our favorite hobby video games, and this is the virtual version of that so so giving each other shit happens without saying so so welcome to our dining table, pass the mozzarella sticks.
1889900	1901900	You know, mozzarella sticks. The reason why I bring all this up is that this is what Bill Maher and folks from a certain generation, or should I say a certain mindset at least are completely missing about Twitch.
1901900	1912900	This is something that I've been guilty of in the past as well. This is something I think Bobby's been guilty of in the past as well probably a lot of us, because we, we didn't bring a well our or vogue or that stuff to Twitch, we probably should have done it
1912900	1926900	years before we actually did. And it was, we kind of did you're right we did do it on Justin TV and all that but it didn't really like explode right out the gate, and this whole thing and Bobby had his Friday night gaming thing along and he'll he'll,
1926900	1936900	he'll be happy to remind you about that story that he was doing Friday night gaming before there was a twitch and he got told I don't know how many times, who wants to sit there and watch other people play video games.
1936900	1948900	So I think maybe because we had both done it in earlier forms and nobody really showed up we kind of wrote it off and didn't didn't go back to it for a long time, probably past the point we should have.
1948900	1961900	But I know I've been one of those people that's like, I don't get why you sit there and watch video games, and it's not and what you learn is it's not about the video games it's about the people and it's about the community.
1961900	1964900	And that's, that's really what it is.
1964900	1965900	Yeah.
1965900	1969900	Let's go to chat because I'm sure folks have their thoughts here.
1969900	1978900	Bobby is in chat with a few good comments here saying I have zero interest in dead by daylight, but I'll watch Jamie and Alan play it. Yeah, I mean if you, you may not be.
1978900	1980900	I appreciate it. Yeah.
1980900	1992900	And Bobby says I watch Rob play Final Fantasy 14 for Rob, not for Final Fantasy 14 I could care less about it at this point well thank you, and also says I watch streamers for the streamers not necessarily for the games.
1992900	2003900	The only exception is when the game is out and I don't yet have it and I want to see it played. That's a good point to like testing games a little bit getting to see the real stuff, or whatever.
2003900	2007900	I want to experience Nino Cooney without having to sludge through.
2008900	2018900	Imagine if Bobby had never played the Nino Cooney demo and instead watch somebody play it on release day, there may have been a very different reaction there.
2018900	2021900	Who knows how terrible the game is.
2021900	2029900	Just kidding, Bob. Oh yeah that's right Bobby says I watched Rob stream Nino Cooney to God that was years ago you have a great memory that's right I did stream that.
2029900	2043900	Now quest Buster has a comment here about Bill Maher's statement saying, Maher doesn't know how deep it goes. It's not only the games, it's the knock on effect they have on people and the communities formed through them to especially in the past
2043900	2055900	year. And I think this is why a lot of us are coming claws out to what this Bill Maher comment was, let's be real, this was some stupid ass joke written in the writing room.
2055900	2066900	Hours before the show went live. This is not something Bill Maher fumes about in his library in his spare time, I have to say something nasty about twitch.
2066900	2078900	Boiled down to like the most cliche of cliche things like nerds our target, people that watch people play games probably nerds, let's make fun of them point fingers at them.
2078900	2088900	I mean that shit's been going on since. We can't talk shit about comic book nerds anymore because they rule Hollywood. So let's pick on someone else.
2088900	2102900	Yeah and there's no, I mean, I don't know I think there's that kind of culture that you know it's more accepting now to be, you know, very passionate about different things and to be a collective it like, you know, for some people it's just.
2102900	2118900	I don't know I get the joke, it was just kind of a throwaway thing, you know, he doesn't get it I guess technically that he thinks it's a fucking waste of time that's his opinion he's entitled to it, but he has a show is a platform, that is also a fucking waste of time.
2118900	2122900	Yeah, there's many people that would tell you a television is a fucking waste of time.
2123900	2132900	Yeah, yeah, so I don't know, whatever it does. Does this end on the note that Bill Maher is the ultimate postgame Dead by Daylight troll.
2132900	2146900	Anyway, I don't think he even knows what that is, he probably doesn't. And I think that just goes to show how ignorant the comment was, I'm sure that is far I'm surprised the only thing he hasn't heard about like it, you know, really want to take targets of like
2146900	2159900	Twitch, you know the hot tub streamers you know like make it a comment on that I mean geez like that's something I'm surprised he didn't go that route. Well yeah, if he if he had targeted the hot tub streamers I bet we wouldn't even be talking about it now.
2159900	2162900	Nobody would have spread it around on Twitch.
2162900	2174900	So yeah, so what I say to Bill Maher is I'm going to say, watch a drag queen play Dead by Daylight on Friday night and come back at me with a comment like that and tell me it's just about the video game, like seriously educate yourself.
2174900	2176900	Anyway, all right, enough about that.
2176900	2186900	Let's get into some positive stuff let's talk about our gaming weeks because video games are fun and I don't know about you guys but I've played some fun video games this week. So let's start with Dark Sakura How was your gaming week.
2186900	2189900	It was more eventful than before.
2189900	2198900	I did play Dead by Daylight I had my glorious ending to my nurse match that was my happy ending nurse game.
2198900	2208900	I, I've been playing a lot of board scapes, I sent you a screenshot earlier about how incredibly addicted I am to it to which I replied intervention.
2208900	2209900	Right.
2209900	2214900	I've been playing Animal Crossing, I've been enjoying that as well.
2214900	2218900	And I think really that's been about it.
2218900	2237900	I've, I've got a few things on my, on my table, including the game I'm going to be playing after the stream tonight, which is Fantasian, I planned on starting it live first playthrough with with whoever wants to watch me.
2237900	2242900	Curse at it loudly probably. So you're gonna go until midnight again tonight.
2242900	2253900	I might go until I'm done with his makeup till. And who knows you may even like get a pause midstream and I come back in my pajamas and no broad no makeup.
2253900	2261900	I'd be like, all right, this is this is time we get real dark soccer unplugged.
2261900	2264900	All right, my pores unplugged.
2264900	2275900	All right, so stay tuned for that after the show tonight for those of you that are here live Fantasian, I want to check a little bit of that out actually so I haven't played it yet but I want to so I'm excited to see it.
2275900	2277900	Anything else you gave me we can want to share.
2277900	2280900	Um, no. Then how about Loki.
2280900	2296900	I played a bit of Orna which really got different recently they did an update that added like villagers or like some sort of people in a town like your areas that you take over you can actually build buildings and stuff like shops, which you could do before,
2296900	2307900	but now they have like these different like a town hall and actual like houses that you can build to have people in them, and they will bring you things.
2307900	2320900	I know there's a thing you can craft like potions and stuff, which I don't know why I would need to do that because I buy them by the thousands so I don't know why I would want to gather resources to make one, but whatever.
2320900	2323900	That's the thing I guess.
2323900	2333900	But yeah, so that that's something that they just recently added so I've been playing that quite a bit. Actually, last month I was able to get the final like reward is they give you like daily rewards if you play each day.
2333900	2338900	And so I was actually able to get the one at the end of the month because I guess they played every single day.
2338900	2344900	So I played that I played a lot of Minecraft.
2344900	2372900	I published my first episode of my Let's Play series on the Collusion MC SMP server that I'm playing on right now so I released that. I'm pretty proud of that. So hopefully more of that will be coming soon I know I've started designing the shop I have that's going in the shopping district so I was working on that last night and it's been big farms like I built this massive gold farm in the nether roof.
2372900	2376900	And so I've been working on that just the farm stuff.
2376900	2380900	So it's, it's, it's fun.
2380900	2386900	You forgot to go to my video, I was gonna say that plug plug that YouTube so that folks go subscribe to you.
2386900	2395900	And of course, local are on YouTube. All right, check it out. Excellent. I tweeted that from the account to so our on Twitter if you want to get the link.
2395900	2402900	Okay, my gaming week well Loki stole my thunder there I also played Orna, which I haven't touched and like a good you know we used to talk about that a lot on the show.
2402900	2415900	I probably haven't touched that game in a good two or three months, but they did that massive update and I was like oh well let me go see what's different. Wow, lots of new things which again is very impressive considering it's just one person that you know really well I mean he contracts
2415900	2427900	for the music and some of the design stuff and that but it's fine but it's essentially one guy man show yeah made most of the game. So it's pretty impressive but yeah there's all that new stuff that's kind of in that so that's that's been fun to look
2427900	2436900	at. I still don't know like what like a lot of that is like I know that one of the potions I saw I didn't recognize but there's like one that's like, you know, you can get a.
2436900	2448900	I don't know like a mid tier like health potion I'm like, why would I do that just buy one like it's for people who are starting it's a little harder to just buy stuff like, yeah, people that are already almost like level 200 build one of those houses that
2448900	2460900	like or build one of the things that actually makes the, the potions it's like 5 million gold or something like for that you could buy like 10,000.
2460900	2470900	I don't know why you would want to do that. So your base fortress or whatever no longer has quests, so you have to build the new thing the the town hall or whatever to get quests.
2470900	2481900	And as you do those quests your morale goes up as your morale goes up your population goes up and they will, if you build the offering hall whatever it's called they will occasionally give you offerings, it's kind of like Actraiser in that regard.
2481900	2493900	So, yeah, I've already built all that stuff and I'm going to be doing more of the quest but yeah it's cool to see some additional stuff. Yeah, it's it's it's reinvigorated the game a little bit which is what it needed because it was getting a little stale for me so that's
2493900	2502900	oh and they added regional chat that's the huge things now there's global chat, and this is the shocking thing I was expecting to go in there and see like totally toxic stuff.
2502900	2514900	No, it's like everybody's being super cool. And it's like oh hey I've seen you around where are you from hey where you know, which in a game where you do go around and take other people's areas and stuff nobody seems to care, which is a very pleasant
2514900	2518900	feeling, unlike some other games I've played where people get very trolly and possessive.
2518900	2531900	Mike finally. Yeah, exactly. It's like oh these people are real who knew. Alright, um, so besides just Orna, I've also been playing a Dead by Daylight of course, but I've made some good progress in that game I leveled back
2531900	2543900	Bubba or Leatherface all the way to 35. And that is important because you need to do that to get barbecue and chili, it which is a talent of his that helps you track, you know I'm trying to try and explain this to the people who don't know dead by
2543900	2553900	daylight, but it helps you track survivors basically. So you can see where they are on the map, just briefly, and it also increases your blood points which is like experience which used to level up.
2553900	2567900	So it's a very necessary talent, and I picked that up and that felt very good so now I'm back and I'm playing Pyramid Head. I did my first Freddy match as well. Dark Sakura my murder sister has decided to buy me more DLC.
2567900	2576900	Thank you. She picked up the plague I forget what that DLC is called but the killer is the plague or Vomie Mommy. You bought that for me.
2577900	2589900	Devotion of the damned. Yeah, so I plague of the damned I don't know what it's called but anyway, I played that I played a Vomie Mommy match or two she's hard. Like, I did not see my frustration and learning her.
2589900	2597900	Yes, because I did not realize as you're inhaling so she's, she's, she's called Vomie Mommy and you can imagine why.
2597900	2601900	When you're inhaling to do your thing. Loki you're not muted.
2601900	2616900	When you're inhaling to do your thing. You slow way down, and I didn't really realize that there are really, really good add ons to to offset that yeah we don't have that in your first or second game.
2616900	2628900	Yeah, so that's taken pretty quickly. Yeah yeah so anyway so that's that's Dead by Daylight. We've talked plenty about that. The other game I've played this week, I'll talk a little more about.
2628900	2640900	We actually did a special stream here on vog network on Friday night, I got my buddy Shane who was part of the definitive Pokemon ranking stream. A couple weeks ago here on the network.
2640900	2657900	No actually that was last week God time, time flies. We actually spent some time playing Pokemon snap and doing first impressions of that game, because Shane had never played Pokemon snap before the first one that was on N64 he had actually never played that game.
2657900	2671900	So, seeing this new one and he was cool enough to like not touch the new version, and actually watch it on stream with me. So we actually streamed it together on, on Friday night, and I had a lot of fun, I enjoyed it.
2671900	2685900	It's a lot of the stuff you really enjoyed about the first game that very relaxing notion of going around and taking pictures of Pokemon, and stuff and having that evaluated it's it's it's not like a normal Pokemon game where you have to send them into battle
2685900	2697900	and the first game doesn't have battling. It's like you're riding a Disneyland ride taking pictures, which is something people do anyway. So I like it it's a cute little diversion type of game.
2697900	2705900	So yeah, check that out if you're a you're a subscriber here at the voice of geeks network. First off, thank you. Second off, you can check that out in the archives and watch that anytime you want.
2705900	2724900	I will point out that was a special stream we just did as like a thank you because so many of you guys, especially in the past couple months, have been donating bits, subscribing, just showing the love when you don't have to so it makes us kind of want to show the love right back by doing more episodes, and many things that we don't necessarily normally do.
2724900	2741900	So that stream was one of them. So big thanks to Shane for showing up for that. And I had fun with the game. And I played for a little bit after the stream as well I got to the jungle level and was playing that and I went back and did the first park level a little bit and was playing that and getting some new Pokemon.
2741900	2755900	I think it's just a nice game to just sit down and play and like 10 or 15 minute bursts. I mean, yes, it takes a lot of time to go through and pick the right pictures you want to show to the professor but I think it's very, very relaxing to go through that.
2756900	2763900	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says has he returned it to the store yet so spoiler alert on the stream.
2763900	2775900	Shane didn't wasn't really into it, like he didn't think it was really for him probably because it isn't about the battling or some of that other stuff. You know the Pokemon is known for I think Shane wasn't really feeling the game for what it was.
2775900	2790900	So knowing that question would come up I actually texted Shane before tonight's show, and I asked him, I said, What happened, did you, did you take it back to the store yet, or what happened and he said, I've yet to play it still sealed.
2790900	2797900	So that I'd say that somewhere in the middle because he didn't take it back. He still has it, but he hasn't played it yet.
2798900	2803900	I just said wow. Yeah. No, he wasn't really feeling it.
2803900	2814900	So, I think it's great. But yeah, I also understand, you know, there's no shinies in it which is a huge thing for Shane because he's big and shinies. There's like 200 something Pokemon.
2814900	2826900	So when you consider that you know there's almost 900 that are out there there's going to be some left out of the game that are, that's going to be a little bit upsetting but there's, there's a lot in there for me so.
2826900	2835900	Yeah, so I enjoyed the game I and I think if you remember the first one on N64 whether you played it back in the day, or you bought it on Virtual Console on Wii or whatever.
2835900	2838900	I think there's a lot to enjoy in this one as well.
2838900	2846900	And I think it's just a nice chill game. And I would, I would play more I can see where the $60 price tag makes people nervous.
2846900	2857900	But I really like that they have like the whole like fake Instagram thing in there, where you upload your pictures of Pokemon and people can like like them, it says not like they have to change the name, because I'm sure Facebook has like trademarks
2857900	2869900	so they call it like, smiles, I don't remember what it's called sorry somebody in shadow correct me, but you have those types of metals that you get on pictures it's cute I think it's really cute.
2869900	2880900	Let's see, actdeftinchat says no shinies and no oshwat family that's true. Meanwhile, I don't care about shinies and Vulpix and Ninetales are in the game so win for me. Yeah, so, and yeah, this one has boss fights.
2880900	2890900	There's like a boss fight playing behind Loki right now. Live on Twitch where it's just basically a stage where you have one Pokemon, you're trying to get the best possible picture of.
2890900	2898900	And I think that's kind of an interesting little twist on the mechanic too. So, and you get what you get to submit one picture at the end. That's kind of neat. So, anyway.
2898900	2909900	All right, let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's happened around the industry this week or maybe discussion of some rumors of things that might be going on right Logan.
2909900	2912900	I can see this happening.
2912900	2931900	I can too. So, you know, with the popularity of Marvel which has been like at all time high. And with the past record of Netherrealm putting out like for example Injustice, and they also have the Marvel or the DC versus Mortal Kombat game as well.
2931900	2960900	Could totally see them working on a Marvel fighting game which is the rumor, at least that they're possibly working on that. And there's been some tweets by Ed Boon that could or could not be a hint at that, you know, he talks about like having lost a year with the, you know, COVID-19 virus and everybody having to be, you know, working overseas and stuff he says it feels like it's returning from the Marvel blip, you know, it could mean something, it could be nothing, you know, who knows.
2960900	2966900	But I could see them doing something along the lines of like an Injustice game or something, I think it'd be really cool.
2966900	2978900	Yeah, Tiger Claw on chat his brain went exactly where mine did when I heard this Tiger Claw on chat says, Netherrealm has the DC license, what if they did a DC versus Marvel fighting game that they would never do that.
2978900	2989900	Disney would never allow that. Yeah, and that's where I'm kind of like, unfortunately, that would be up to Netherrealm to determine because DC would have to sign off on that and Marvel would have to sign off on that and I could see where the hesitation would be for both sides.
2989900	3007900	Although certainly my god if they can make it work that I think I who wouldn't want to see that maybe some people wouldn't want it to be by Netherrealm I could see that but who wouldn't the idea of a DC versus Marvel fighting game I think a lot of people would like to see somebody their favorite
3007900	3023900	I could see a Capcom DC fighting game I think that would be pretty cool. Yeah, well there was a DC Mortal Kombat game that was. Yeah, I understand that but like, no, like a Capcom game though. Yeah, like along the lines of Marvel versus Capcom.
3023900	3052900	Well, and the story also kind of brings that part of it up what about Marvel versus Capcom Does that mean that series is is done I mean, I know you know the infinite and all that it wasn't maybe as well received across the board as as MVC two but I think a lot of people were still hoping there would still be like another entry in the Marvel Capcom series because someone's making a Marvel game doesn't mean that they're not making a Marvel game or couldn't make a Marvel game I mean we just had a Marvel game come out from Square Enix.
3053900	3058900	You know, Avengers, I don't think that necessarily writes it off.
3058900	3065900	I'm going to chat for some other comments, active in chat says DC versus Capcom new age of gods well you never know, it could happen.
3066900	3082900	DGRama S with a dream studio suggestion in chat I'd rather see Arc System Works, or Bandai Namco do a Marvel fighting game, they can add the comic feel of it, and I can certainly see the arcs, yeah I can see both those companies really with that request on that for sure.
3083900	3096900	Tiger class says I think nether realm would turn out a really good Marvel fighting game with how those fighting games look cinematic and its presentation. Yeah, I think, because the whole multiverse thing I mean it would just be insane.
3096900	3108900	Well, and the the injustice games are pretty good. I like them, they're they're neat. And I think you're right I think there could be an interesting like I could see where nether realm might make a cinematic universe type of game.
3108900	3119900	Whereas then Capcom can kind of continue in the comic universe sort of game. I could see where the characters and injustice or injustice nether realms Marvel's injustice whatever the hell it is.
3119900	3134900	If I could see how those characters might be based more off the movie personas, although, then you get into all the likenesses and having to pay the actors and actresses so might not be exact but I can see where they might do a take on the cinematic universe as opposed to the comic universe.
3134900	3147900	It would just be a different style it'd be kind of like injustice where you know it's less. I don't think that's necessarily based on a cinematic universe or whatever but I know I'd like to see it I think it'd be pretty cool.
3148900	3158900	Sjoan Hunter Matt in chat says really hope folks temper their expectations for nether realm fighting game. Keep in mind, Marvel is a Disney property, you're not going to see Captain America get his skull crushed.
3158900	3161900	Sure, that's, that's not an injustice.
3163900	3166900	But I hope folks understand it will be injustice light.
3166900	3172900	Yeah, injustice can still get a little bit brutal but certainly none of those fatalities.
3172900	3189900	Yeah, no, no, no, but I get what has shown him out is saying it would have to, it would have to be even less gritty than injustice I think for Disney to sign off on it but also look at the DC Cinematic Universe versus the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
3189900	3201900	A lot of people have kind of dogged on the DC Cinematic Universe because it is too gritty. Overall, so injustice kind of just reflects where the cinematic universe is that I think that's my opinion.
3201900	3211900	Well, I think when it justice was made they didn't really have much of a cinematic universe anyways it were we on the Christian Bale films and stuff like that around that time, I can't even remember I guess you're right they hadn't.
3211900	3225900	Maybe Batman and Superman was a thing, but that might be as far as. No, no, there wasn't Batman versus Superman Yeah, it was pretty much just its own that that was the first for me is that Batman and Superman movie.
3225900	3229900	I didn't like it. It's way before that. Yeah. All right, fair enough.
3229900	3239900	Tiger class says they could do a multiverse type of story where there's a version of the Marvel Universe that's dark, and they have explored that in the comics before I suppose anything is possible, but I would think they'd want to tie into something
3239900	3248900	with like, you know, the current like Loki, which is good not not our Loki but the Loki in the Marvel Universe which is going to be having his own show on Disney Plus very soon.
3248900	3254900	And, you know, Wanda vision, you know all that stuff that's you know that's out there right now.
3254900	3255900	We'll see.
3255900	3268900	So, yeah, anyhow, I know I still would like to see it just because I think Netherrealm makes good fighting games. And even though I'm not super into the newer Mortal Kombat games just because the violence is a little much for me.
3268900	3278900	I think injustice is a pretty solid franchise, so I'd be curious to see what they do with that. So, well let's talk about a different thing that's going on over in the house of Capcom.
3278900	3284900	So Capcom in the not too distant past released the Capcom arcade.
3284900	3296900	Capcom arcade stadium was what it was called that came out on the Nintendo switch. I know I picked it up and I for a retro collection I thought it was really solid it's really good dark soccer you and Dan picked that up as well right if I remember right.
3296900	3305900	Yeah, yeah, and you guys enjoy that too I'm assuming because that's true. Oh, yeah, mostly, mostly, mostly Dan's been playing a lot of die mark I'm Laura.
3305900	3318900	Well some news coming out in the past week that Capcom arcade stadium is going to come to more systems, not just the switch, it will be coming out for more platforms in May so it's going to be coming out for I think all the other ones PlayStation
3319900	3334900	Xbox one and steam yeah so pretty much all the big ones coming out on May 25, and there are, there's talk that there will be new games that will also be added as well I think that's very exciting so I'm really glad that the template has allowed because
3334900	3342900	I kind of wondered I was like you know they could just fit more games into this, and it looks like that is the way they're going to go they're going to add more games to the collection.
3342900	3350900	We don't know what they are yet, but there is talk that those games are going to be coming. Now, on the, I don't know if this is exciting side of things.
3350900	3364900	There's also some other modes that will be coming and invincibility mode. It allows you to just play through the games and you don't have to worry about ever dying, but you're all the quarters are fake anyway so whatever.
3364900	3371900	The invincibility mode and the new frames that come with it will cost $1.
3371900	3374900	So you have to pay for invincibility.
3374900	3378900	So, yeah, I think that's interesting.
3378900	3393900	Yeah, that just drives people to want to go to emulators right. I think it's interesting they threw in the frames with it to try to be like well we're charging for the cosmetics to as a little bit of a.
3393900	3395900	Yeah.
3395900	3412900	Okay, that's the display frames, set one. So that is coming out supposed to be 32 new frames though which okay. Anyway, I'm in a related note, another game retro thing that Capcom did recently was the ghosts and goblins resurrection.
3412900	3425900	I believe you may have had your eyes on that that is also going to PlayStation four PC and Xbox one on June 1. So for whatever reason you haven't picked that up yet on switch, and maybe one of those other console speaks to you more.
3425900	3428900	You can check that out on June 1.
3429900	3435900	That's it ghosts and goblins is a good one at your household to did you pick this up the resurrection at all.
3435900	3448900	Not yet actually, I don't know why Dan's been waiting on it. I mean, he's probably a little bit more of, you know, the ghosts and goblins fan than I am, because I mean honestly it's hard and it makes me scream.
3448900	3455900	So, I think, I mean, I keep encouraging him to get to get it but he hasn't gotten it yet so whatever.
3455900	3466900	Dark Tetsuya pointing out Capcom arcade stadium still has rewind built in so I he's like I don't know why would you need to do invisibility I think or invincibility excuse me I think that's a good question.
3466900	3479900	Dark Tetsuya also says I am hoping one of the updates includes Black Tiger. That's my favorite from Capcom's early catalog Yeah, that would be nice to see some of the other, the ones that were overlooked from the back catalog will be pretty cool.
3479900	3493900	Going back to the last story, a little bit, I would point out what Bobby Black Wolf says here saying, let's just have soccer I make the Marvel fighting game. How about letting, how about letting soccer I take a fucking nap.
3493900	3498900	I have a feeling sake soccer I'd never wants to work on a fighting game again.
3498900	3500900	And I you know why he's earned it.
3500900	3510900	I'm making that up I don't know I'm not in his head but I let the man take a goddamn nap. Don't, don't, don't put him in the Marvel universe right now.
3510900	3514900	All right, let's move on dark soccer we have for us.
3514900	3522900	Well, it's the stadia news because I mean as we all know now I'm playing quite a bit more stadia.
3522900	3538900	But they are adding a much needed search bar to the freaking web store, thank God, because you have to kind of scroll through all this crap I mean, how in the hell does a search engine, you know company.
3538900	3544900	Certainly, search engine, not have some kind of search feature in their damn game store.
3544900	3563900	So, now you can click on it and you can type in whatever you're looking for and also it seems to hint that there's going to be a Assassin's Creed of some variety being added to stadia.
3563900	3566900	So, keep your eyes open.
3566900	3577900	Well that is nice that finally the search engines game store got a search engine isn't that lovely. So that's the joke a lot of people are making this week and even Jason.
3577900	3590900	The introduction of the show, I guess when you don't have a lot of games on your service though you don't need a search bar so I guess that's a sign that stadia is getting more and more games that's for sure so there's that yeah, I guess I have to watch my
3590900	3595900	jokes and and stuff with stadia because dark soccer is actually playing on it.
3595900	3603900	It's, it's saved my, my tail, you know I have it keeps me in the game it makes me really happy. All right.
3603900	3616900	It's definitely better than I thought it was over all of the technologies great like yeah it's just the whole you know the bandwidth caps. By the way, we did exceed our bandwidth cap last month in this house do you want to you want to hear the funniest part,
3616900	3620900	we exceeded our bandwidth cap, ready for this by nine gigs.
3620900	3623900	Geez.
3623900	3636900	I hate it that's, it's ridiculous. Well, you get one month waived or whatever but it's like at the same time I'm like well let me pay the fee this month when we went nine gigs over, and then give me, give me the free month.
3636900	3646900	When I decided to go on an Xbox in November when all the new games come out and I go on a downloading binge go on a gaming vendor. Exactly. So it's just it's just ridiculous there shouldn't be a bandwidth capital.
3646900	3661900	Well, they are like unlimited data now to like you can pay for that. I think that's what we have is like $100 a month though in it. Yeah, really high. Yeah, so it's, I think we pay like some like 75 bucks for our whole package.
3661900	3668900	The overage fees max out at $100 anyway, so it's a little, little silly.
3668900	3683900	That's really nothing. It's really isn't so. All right. But, you know, I mentioned on the show before Alan and I are trying to look at relocating. That's something we've been working on so, and the part of town we're relocating to actually has options there's competing
3683900	3696900	internet services so maybe we won't have to worry about bandwidth caps so much in the future. I haven't looked at what the rivals offer though. All right, moving on. Let's get to our next story which I think is Loki's.
3696900	3712900	Yeah. So, Microsoft is actually taking I don't know if they're, they're doing this because of epic but they are also cutting the rev share from their storefront from 30% to 12%.
3712900	3728900	Now, it's right now it's I believe PC games launching on their Xbox storefront will be able to earn more money that way. I don't believe this applies to their actual Xbox storefront that's on their console.
3728900	3730900	Not yet.
3731900	3735900	It's just the the PC, Windows Store I guess.
3735900	3746900	It's rumored for the Xbox, but nothing concrete about when that's going to happen. And it would also it would be a logical step certainly. So but nothing concrete on that yet.
3746900	3759900	Yeah, so we'll have to wait and see what happens with that I don't know if the Apple epic lawsuit has anything to do with motivation for this stuff because we've been seeing kind of a lot of different moves that kind of tie in with that.
3759900	3761900	Yeah, but I don't know.
3761900	3775900	Bobby buckles and what's good for developers, Bobby black woven chat says they came out and said it's not coming to Xbox I took it to kind of be interpreted as nothing's confirmed at this time, like, it might still happen in the future, I, I, I don't think
3775900	3788900	we will not be updating the revenue split for console publishers are the insane thing that that isn't a definitive no not ever to me, but at the same time we shouldn't run with it is coming to Xbox just, we don't know yet.
3788900	3802900	But I don't know I just, I have a hard time believing it never will, but you're, you're also right in that it's probably waiting to see what comes out of some of these other legal things going on right now because it's not, you know, you've got that
3802900	3811900	Apple and epic thing going on, you've got the anti trust going on for not just Apple but Facebook but Google, you got a lot of tech companies under the microscope right now.
3811900	3822900	I think Microsoft might actually be involved in that too I can't even fucking keep track anymore. So you have so much tech that's under the microscope right now that I could see where Microsoft's kind of waiting on some of that to see where they need
3822900	3836900	to move accordingly, but I would say it's, it strikes me as a, it's not a never ever sort of situation, but I suppose nothing is in this industry right so well they will want to like make promises they're not going to keep.
3836900	3837900	Yeah.
3837900	3850900	So, Bobby lack of does point out that we know about this because of the epic Apple lawsuit it's part of the evidence that has been entered into this entire class says, calling it the Apple epic lawsuit strikes me funny.
3850900	3853900	It's going to be anything but epic lol.
3853900	3867900	Well, tomorrow's gonna be a big day let's just say that, of course we're taping live on Sunday night, Monday is when all that stuff is going to be in court. I, you know, I'm not a lawyer and I don't even watch Law and Order so I'm not going to sit here
3867900	3874900	and try to say what I think ought to happen or what should happen. All I'm going to say is, it's going to be interesting. That's it.
3874900	3884900	So, especially to see what what comes as a result of that. All right, let's move on, let's get into a story about among us.
3884900	3894900	You know which was huge on Twitch for quite some time and it's still it's still around but I don't see it as often as I used to.
3894900	3899900	It's still, it's still popular just I don't think it's necessarily on our radar. Yeah.
3899900	3909900	Well, you know, something that's only going to help it grow is this story about how among us is going to be coming to PlayStation four and PlayStation five later in the year.
3909900	3923900	This came up during a state of play, a little kind of like Sony's little version of Nintendo directs they did their own little PlayStation direct this week, and they confirmed that among us is going to be coming to PlayStation four and five later this year.
3923900	3936900	It will have cross play capabilities so many get to cross play on other platforms with your friends, but it also comes with a platform exclusive skin, it has to do with the Ratchet and Clank franchise, so you get your own little Ratchet Clank skins in the game,
3936900	3952900	which considering the focus of the state of play they were showing a lot of the new Ratchet Clank game. With that it makes sense that that kind of ties in there. So, yeah, I don't think we did we get a date on that I don't think we did we just got a later this year so we don't know when.
3952900	3958900	It is also supposed to. It's also supposed to hit series x and s on the Xbox side of the house.
3958900	3972900	Later this year as well but we also don't know the exact day when that is coming either. It should be noted that among us got a big update recently. If you haven't been paying attention, the airship map launched relatively recently.
3972900	3981900	So, yeah, like a few like a couple months ago. Yeah. So, all right, let's move on and talk about our next story.
3981900	3990900	Yes, this is a very good news for people who like to collect, you know, physical versions of games.
3990900	4008900	There is, of course, the Castlevania anniversary collection for PS4 and Switch, and now pre orders for the physical collection is going to start on May 14 at 10am Eastern time just before the new Netflix season starts.
4008900	4014900	And you get four different editions see there's a standard which is just the game.
4014900	4024900	There's a classic one that has the game soundtrack on CD or reversible poster, and a retro style does leave.
4024900	4043900	It's also in metallic ink and then the bloodlines edition, adds to this, the, an 18 by 24 inch poster in a deluxe clamshell and then finally the ultimate edition has the soundtrack the poster.
4043900	4050900	And actually the artwork is done by Tom Dubois who did a lot of classic Konami game artwork.
4050900	4073900	Shadowbox that has light and sound steel book collection of mini replica boxes dust sleeve box art prints of the original. The first three Castlevania games, an enamel pin, and a physical version of the history of Castlevania, which I know I might have to have to pay money.
4074900	4088900	The only thing I'm bummed about is that it didn't happen like months ago, because that Castlevania collection has been out a little while. So it almost seems like this is a bit late for this to be finally happening, but at the same time, you know, they've really gone all out with this
4088900	4094900	like I think it's really cool they're getting the actual artists that did a lot of that Konami box art to actually participate with this.
4094900	4098900	175 bucks. You still kind of want it though, don't you?
4098900	4102900	Kinda, I super want it.
4102900	4108900	I understand, I understand and a lot of classic Konami fans are going to want it and Castlevania fans.
4108900	4113900	And this is all you get when it comes to Castlevania anymore so.
4113900	4131900	I mean, this thing is, so the games that are on it, I mean, just to recap for those who haven't played it is Castlevania, Castlevania II Simon's Quest, Castlevania III Dracula's Curse, Super Castlevania IV, Castlevania The Adventure, Castlevania II Belmont's Revenge, Castlevania Bloodlines, and Kid Dracula, which I love Kid Dracula.
4131900	4136900	But that was, that was on sale on the PlayStation 4 over the holidays for 15 bucks.
4136900	4141900	I know, but some people like to have, you know, light boxes and art books.
4141900	4144900	Yes, yes. And dishes and spoons.
4144900	4146900	And dishes and spoons. Don't judge me.
4146900	4151900	I get it. I get it. Why can't it come, why can't it come with a whip? That's what I want to know.
4151900	4153900	Shouldn't you know that I have a whip?
4153900	4155900	What about, is it a Castlevania whip?
4155900	4158900	No, it's an Indiana Jones whip that I bought at Disneyland.
4158900	4160900	It can be a Castlevania whip.
4160900	4161900	I didn't know Disneyland.
4161900	4163900	Technically, Kristen bought it for me.
4163900	4165900	Hold up, Disneyland sells whips?
4165900	4167900	Yeah, they have Indiana Jones.
4167900	4171900	Right across from the temple of the...
4171900	4175900	Y'all, I'm aware that there is Indiana Jones at Disneyland.
4175900	4178900	That part I get. I just, I didn't know they sold weapons at Disneyland.
4178900	4180900	That's news to me.
4180900	4181900	They, of course, sell weapons at Disneyland.
4181900	4184900	That's the first place I would go to find weapons.
4186900	4188900	So, side story about that.
4188900	4190900	The day that Kristen bought me my hat and my whip,
4191900	4197900	we also bought giant snakes and we saw snakes on a plane at the theater at downtown Disney wearing snakes.
4200900	4202900	Oh my God. All right, the end.
4204900	4210900	Anyway, yes, they should have a Castlevania whip and they should have Castlevania official holy water.
4210900	4215900	If it was the Castlevania whip, though, you know it would be made out of steel chain.
4215900	4217900	Yeah, only the good stuff.
4217900	4219900	I'm fine with that.
4219900	4223900	It's expensive and then, I mean, it's practically a meteor hammer is what it is.
4225900	4226900	All right.
4226900	4228900	Watch my enemies.
4228900	4231900	Something, something in my second amendment, I think.
4231900	4233900	You know, metal whips.
4233900	4234900	I'll call the gun.
4234900	4236900	It is an armament.
4237900	4239900	Yes, they, yeah, the right to bear arms.
4239900	4241900	The government's trying to take my whips.
4241900	4245900	They could be medieval weapons of death.
4245900	4249900	That's it. I'm traveling. I'm going to open carry a morning star.
4251900	4253900	There's no laws against it, right?
4253900	4255900	There are no laws against open carrying a morning star, I think.
4255900	4256900	There you go.
4257900	4261900	All right, before this gets really weird, let's move on to our next story, Loki.
4262900	4265900	It can always get weirder. It's fine.
4266900	4268900	So, sure, sure.
4268900	4274900	With the story about whips, now let's do a story about Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village.
4274900	4281900	How about she's a resident evil village had a demo recently, and it was a time demo.
4281900	4286900	This now a time demo that could work if it's on consoles.
4286900	4291900	But if it's on PC, you really don't have control over the time demo on that.
4291900	4303900	So that's what happened is folks figured out that this time demo that was really only going to be 60 minutes originally was now people found a way to reset that timer so that they could play longer
4303900	4308900	or play, you know, longer than the intended time.
4308900	4313900	Capcom then later on came out and extended the time even more.
4313900	4315900	But, you know, folks said, who cares?
4315900	4318900	I have a way to do it as many times as I want.
4318900	4324900	So I don't understand what the point of making a limited demo in the first place.
4324900	4326900	It doesn't make any sense to me.
4326900	4328900	Well, because they don't make money off the demo.
4328900	4331900	They make money off of you buying the game because you got just the first hits free.
4331900	4332900	That's what it is.
4332900	4337900	Yeah, but like what if you didn't get a good impression of the game the first time you played it?
4337900	4339900	So that's it.
4339900	4341900	Ask the creators of Ni No Kuni.
4341900	4342900	I don't know what to tell you.
4342900	4344900	That's very stupid.
4344900	4345900	Nintendo does the same thing.
4345900	4347900	They have their like 30 demo.
4347900	4350900	You play this demo 30 times and that's it.
4350900	4358900	Sometimes folks want to like are excited about a game and they just want to play the demo over and over and over again until the full game comes out.
4358900	4359900	Like I did with Saints Row.
4359900	4367900	But sure, let's just poo poo on the fans like that and limit things, make it more difficult.
4367900	4373900	Well, it is very silly that they released that on PC with the timer as if it wasn't going to get hacked.
4373900	4375900	I mean, that's just begging for it.
4375900	4380900	I mean, this is the biggest like non-surprise story of the entire year.
4380900	4384900	Like, oh, a time demo was released and instantly hacked on PC.
4384900	4391900	I'm sure it's been hacked on consoles too if you've done other things to your console to allow you to get in there and mod it for it.
4391900	4395900	It's just not as easy as it is on PC, which is an open platform by design.
4395900	4397900	Pretty much, yeah.
4397900	4401900	SSG100Matt in chat says, you get to watch for free. Touching is extra.
4401900	4403900	Yeah, it's that whole thing.
4403900	4404900	Let's see.
4404900	4408900	OrangeRide in chat says, don't want people to play the demo and think, yep, this is good enough.
4408900	4410900	See Doom's shareware version.
4410900	4413900	Well, that was, I mean, I do get that.
4413900	4418900	A lot of people only ever played that shareware version and that was Doom. That was it.
4418900	4421900	They didn't realize, wait, there's an episode two and three. What?
4421900	4423900	And four.
4423900	4425900	I think there was a four as well. I can't remember.
4425900	4428900	Some of them had six. Some of them had four.
4428900	4433900	Because Wolfenstein 3D was like the first big, big game I remember like that.
4433900	4435900	I think that had six episodes.
4435900	4437900	No, it was four, I think.
4437900	4441900	No, it had six because I remember, okay, here's what I remember about Wolfenstein 3D.
4441900	4446900	It wasn't even the Wolfenstein 3D. It was the Mortal Kombat mod somebody made for Wolfenstein 3D.
4446900	4450900	And then you actually got to fight like Scorpion and stuff at the end of the level.
4450900	4453900	It was just graphic mods and things like that. It was silly.
4453900	4456900	Those are always the fun things.
4456900	4460900	Yeah, Bobby agrees with me. There were six episodes of Wolfenstein.
4460900	4463900	Doom may have only had four. I think you're right on that.
4463900	4466900	All right, anyhow.
4466900	4470900	Let's talk about a game that didn't have enough for the price that people paid for it.
4470900	4473900	Super Mario Party, I don't know. It had enough for some people.
4473900	4476900	But there was a lot of people, I think, that played that game wondering,
4476900	4479900	why can't I play Mario Party online?
4479900	4484900	Like, the year is 20, actually probably 2020, I think, when this came out.
4484900	4487900	It's 2021 now. Why can't I play Mario Party online?
4487900	4490900	Well, guess what? Nintendo came out this week and said, you can.
4490900	4494900	You will be able to play Super Mario Party online.
4494900	4498900	Now, to be clear, I'm talking about the full board game experience
4499900	4502900	because, technically, when Mario Party launched,
4502900	4507900	it had a Mario-thon mode where some of the minigames were playable online.
4507900	4510900	Somebody's going to correct me if I don't correct myself.
4510900	4516900	But a new update is out that is giving Super Mario Party a bigger multiplayer experience.
4516900	4521900	Up to four people can play the classic board game or the team-based partner play.
4521900	4524900	Seventy of the 80 minigames are available.
4524900	4528900	I'm not sure why ten were left out, but I'm guessing they were things
4528900	4531900	that don't do well with lag or internet and things like that.
4531900	4536900	Those games were only good until March 31st, so unfortunately they had to be cut.
4536900	4540900	That's right, that's right. Mario is no longer selectable.
4540900	4544900	Really, the only reason this game's getting published is because Luigi's in it, so it's fine.
4544900	4547900	It's actually now Super Luigi Party.
4547900	4551900	You can actually mix and match online and local. That's pretty cool.
4551900	4554900	All this shade we're throwing aside, that part's pretty cool
4554900	4558900	because that means you could have two people in one place versus two people in another.
4558900	4560900	That could be pretty cool.
4560900	4563900	You will have to have a Switch Online membership to play online,
4563900	4566900	but that is now the norm in Nintendo, so there you go.
4566900	4570900	But I think it's very interesting that it's all this time after the fact,
4570900	4576900	and it is a free update, so as much shit as we give Nintendo, let's give them this.
4576900	4579900	This was not something they sold with the original game,
4579900	4581900	and people dogged them for it.
4581900	4584900	Here it is a year later, they've released it.
4584900	4586900	What do y'all think?
4586900	4590900	Should we be applauding Nintendo, or should we be saying,
4590900	4593900	you really should have thought of that nine months ago, Nintendo?
4593900	4596900	I don't know, I'm kind of torn, because I think it's great.
4596900	4599900	Nintendo does have a pretty good track record,
4599900	4603900	especially when it comes to some other people in the industry like EA,
4603900	4609900	of supporting games quite a while after launch with very robust DLC,
4609900	4613900	surprise patches such as this, and what we saw with Mario Maker,
4613900	4615900	and things along those lines.
4615900	4617900	I think there are some things where we should be cheering Nintendo,
4617900	4620900	and that's great things, but this is really one of those things where you're like,
4620900	4624900	why now? This took a long time.
4624900	4630900	But hey, they could have saved it for Super Mario Party 2, and they didn't.
4631900	4634900	Yeah, I guess, but I mean...
4634900	4637900	Oh god, ActDef points out it's actually two and a half years.
4637900	4639900	Oh my god, I thought it was a year old.
4639900	4641900	The pandemic has fucked with us all.
4641900	4643900	I thought it was only a year old game.
4643900	4645900	Okay, it's a two and a half year old game, so now...
4645900	4647900	Do they even sell it anymore?
4647900	4650900	Oh, I'm sure, oh yeah, online, of course.
4650900	4655900	Even though it had Mario in it, they did not pull it on March 31st,
4655900	4657900	so you can still buy it on the eShop.
4657900	4660900	In fact, when I went in to buy Pokemon Snap,
4660900	4665900	Target still had a copy of 3D All-Stars, and I would bet a lot of stores still do, so...
4665900	4668900	Oh yeah, like the one Target I go to frequently,
4668900	4674900	they still have like 10 or 15 of those gaming watches still.
4674900	4675900	Oh wow.
4675900	4677900	Like, they were off the shelves for a long time,
4677900	4679900	and then their last shipment, everyone's just like,
4679900	4681900	nah, I don't really need that.
4681900	4683900	And so they've been sitting there.
4683900	4685900	I'm waiting for them to get discounted.
4686900	4690900	Act F says the release date was October 5th, 2018.
4690900	4692900	My god, I honestly thought it was a year ago,
4692900	4695900	but what is time in this pandemic anymore?
4695900	4696900	So, cut me some slack.
4696900	4699900	Alright, but there you go.
4699900	4702900	That feature coming to Mario Party after all this time, so...
4702900	4704900	Maybe, and you know what, Loki?
4704900	4707900	You know, you kind of say, is the game even available anymore?
4707900	4711900	Maybe this is something where it's gonna encourage another printing of the game,
4711900	4714900	and they're gonna put it back on shelves with this whole tag,
4714900	4717900	so it's almost like you're putting a second life into the game,
4717900	4722900	because usually games sell what they're gonna sell within the first 30 days.
4722900	4724900	You know what I mean?
4724900	4725900	Like, it makes its biggest impact.
4725900	4727900	It's splashing those first 30 days.
4727900	4728900	It makes the legs longer.
4728900	4729900	Yeah, and then it's a slow burn.
4729900	4734900	But now it's like another kind of like sales spike
4734900	4737900	that they could get away with with this by putting it back out there saying,
4737900	4739900	now available to play online.
4739900	4742900	Which, you know, maybe...
4742900	4745900	I didn't even really think of this when I first read the story,
4745900	4746900	but it would make a lot of sense.
4746900	4748900	Maybe the pandemic played into that.
4748900	4750900	Because you can't, you know...
4750900	4753900	Even though now that the vaccine is out and we have that guidance
4753900	4756900	that, you know, vaccinated people can hang out in small groups,
4756900	4758900	which reminds me, Dark Sakura, we need to like hang out.
4758900	4759900	Like, we're both vaccinated.
4759900	4761900	Actually, Loki, we're all vaccinated.
4761900	4763900	We haven't hung out yet.
4763900	4765900	We have to do that at some point.
4765900	4768900	But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, during this pandemic,
4768900	4769900	a lot of people couldn't get...
4769900	4772900	Well, and the situation is not the same in Japan.
4772900	4777900	You know, we're seeing like the Universal theme park has closed again
4777900	4780900	and, you know, things are in a different situation there, for example.
4780900	4784900	So maybe the pandemic caused this to happen
4784900	4787900	because you can't exactly invite your friends over to play Mario Party
4787900	4789900	in all parts of the world right now.
4789900	4791900	So that could be...
4791900	4794900	I didn't really think about that, but I bet that plays into it.
4794900	4796900	So, all right.
4796900	4797900	I would imagine.
4797900	4801900	Anyway, where's the Twitch streams now of this?
4801900	4804900	This is the game I want to see AOC play.
4804900	4807900	I want to see her and I want to see a Republican
4807900	4809900	in the House of Representatives.
4809900	4813900	Listen, we don't need declarations of war.
4813900	4817900	I want to see Congress people playing Mario Party.
4817900	4818900	That's what I want.
4818900	4821900	Get AOC and get Ted Cruz.
4821900	4822900	He'd be easy to beat.
4822900	4823900	He'd just fall asleep.
4823900	4824900	And you know what?
4824900	4825900	When the odds aren't in his favor,
4825900	4828900	he'll just leave and go to Tahiti or wherever it was he went.
4828900	4829900	Cancun.
4829900	4830900	Cancun, thank you.
4830900	4832900	He'll just go there and he'll be easy to beat.
4832900	4833900	All right.
4833900	4835900	Let's move on.
4835900	4838900	SSG100Matt says, Or Vog?
4838900	4841900	Well, you're talking about me dropping $60 on a game,
4841900	4843900	but maybe for a bonus stream.
4843900	4844900	Maybe.
4844900	4845900	I have it already, so...
4845900	4846900	Oh, do you?
4846900	4847900	Then I'm going to come buy it.
4847900	4848900	I'm pretty sure I'll buy all the Mario games.
4848900	4849900	All right.
4849900	4850900	Maybe.
4850900	4852900	I don't think Bobby has it either, though, so I don't know.
4852900	4853900	We'll see.
4853900	4854900	All right.
4855900	4859900	ActDef says, I did actually see people streaming Super Mario Party,
4859900	4862900	but then Returnal and Pokemon Snap happened.
4862900	4863900	That's true.
4863900	4866900	Yeah, we didn't even really talk about Returnal this week,
4866900	4869900	and I'll just shout the game out because I am interested in it,
4869900	4873900	but unfortunately, just with stuff going on personally,
4873900	4876900	I can't really dump 500 bucks on a PlayStation 5 right now
4876900	4877900	if I could even find one.
4877900	4882900	I mean, I'd get Shane to help me because he knows how to do all that stuff.
4882900	4883900	So I'd get him to help me.
4883900	4885900	I am very interested in Returnal.
4885900	4886900	I want to play it.
4886900	4887900	It looks really cool.
4887900	4890900	Unfortunately, I'm just locked out of a PlayStation 5 right now.
4890900	4892900	I imagine that is a similar situation for...
4892900	4894900	Well, Loki, you have a PS5, right?
4894900	4895900	No.
4895900	4896900	Oh, I thought you did.
4896900	4897900	I have a Series X.
4897900	4898900	Oh, that's right.
4898900	4899900	I can't even remember anymore.
4899900	4901900	So none of us have a PS5 right now,
4901900	4905900	and odds are none of you do either because they're hard to find.
4905900	4907900	I'm not really interested in getting one right now either.
4908900	4913900	Returnal I would play, but maybe I'll wait just a little bit longer.
4913900	4915900	Well, in reality, just because of things going on in my personal life.
4915900	4917900	I'll probably get one this holiday
4917900	4921900	because it's very likely to be some type of hardware refresh,
4921900	4925900	like a larger drive or a different color system
4925900	4926900	or something like that.
4926900	4928900	They're going to zhuzh it up a little bit for this holiday season,
4928900	4930900	and hopefully they're actually available.
4930900	4931900	So we'll see.
4932900	4933900	All right.
4933900	4934900	Questbuster in Chat says,
4934900	4936900	Best description I've heard of Returnal on streams
4936900	4940900	is that it's a cross between Contra, Risk of Rain, and Super Stardust,
4940900	4942900	which makes sense because it's the same studio that did Super Stardust,
4942900	4943900	if I remember right.
4943900	4944900	So, yeah, very interesting.
4944900	4945900	That sounds insane.
4945900	4946900	Yeah.
4946900	4947900	It sounds awesome.
4947900	4948900	All right.
4948900	4952900	Let's get to the classic game of the week.
4952900	4954900	And every week here on the show,
4954900	4956900	DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault
4956900	4957900	and finds a game that she thinks,
4957900	4960900	hey, listen up, you brats.
4960900	4965900	Instead of your newfangled returnals and your Pokemon snaps from 2021,
4965900	4969900	you should check out this classic game instead.
4969900	4971900	But I have to admit, DarkSakura,
4971900	4973900	you did a really weird game this week.
4973900	4975900	You did a really weird thing this week.
4975900	4978900	Well, it's a fucking weird arcade game.
4978900	4983900	Oh, I didn't catch that it was your flag.
4983900	4985900	Oh, I'm an idiot.
4985900	4986900	OK.
4986900	4987900	That's right.
4987900	4988900	It's me now.
4988900	4989900	Hello.
4989900	4990900	All right.
4990900	4993900	Well, then let me also state in a 2021 twist,
4993900	4994900	which I somehow missed,
4994900	4996900	DarkSakura actually picks an arcade.
4996900	4998900	That's what, because I looked at it and I'm like,
4998900	4999900	is this 10 years old?
4999900	5000900	I don't think it is.
5000900	5002900	OK, I get it because it's a different thing.
5002900	5008900	OK, so she picks a weird arcade game to put on display for everybody.
5008900	5009900	OK.
5009900	5011900	And this one isn't Japanese either.
5011900	5016900	And a lot of us associate the weird ass arcade games with Japanese.
5016900	5017900	So how about that?
5017900	5019900	I got out twisted.
5019900	5020900	I got outplayed.
5020900	5023900	DarkSakura just voted me off the island with this pick this week.
5023900	5024900	Good job.
5024900	5025900	All right.
5025900	5026900	What is it?
5026900	5027900	You were on third hook.
5027900	5029900	Yes, I just went to third hook.
5029900	5030900	There it is.
5030900	5031900	I just.
5031900	5033900	I don't get because I don't play Dead by Daylight.
5033900	5034900	Well, maybe you should start.
5034900	5035900	All right.
5035900	5036900	Here it is.
5036900	5038900	The fucking weird arcade game of the month.
5038900	5040900	DarkSakura, what did you pick?
5040900	5043900	The last bar fighter.
5043900	5047900	Not to be confused with the Simpsons episode.
5047900	5055900	So the last bar fighter has the distinction of being a kind of redemption game, you know,
5055900	5059900	but what you redeem is beer.
5059900	5066900	So it is a really simplistic fighting game.
5067900	5075900	Basically, you start with putting your cups on the tray below the tap, which is going
5075900	5086900	to replace the the coin slots and pretty much, you know, once you do that, then you can choose
5086900	5091900	one of five different characters, all named after different big boss brews.
5091900	5097900	It was done for the big boss brewing company as a marketing tool.
5102900	5108900	Basically, you have like different, you know, very simple attacks.
5108900	5117900	I mean, you'll get, you know, fire throwing and unicorn horn impaling and all kinds of
5117900	5118900	stuff.
5118900	5124900	You have a character that looks like Misty Knight from, you know, Marvel.
5124900	5135900	And but basically, the winner of the cup gets a sample of beer from a keg inside the machine.
5135900	5141900	It's interesting.
5141900	5145900	And so it's actually called the beercade.
5145900	5153900	It's their first ever beer dispensing arcade game to offer an interesting way to sample
5153900	5154900	beers.
5154900	5157900	And so that's where the last bar fighter comes in.
5157900	5163900	It is actually developed from a flash based game.
5163900	5171900	Your characters are named Hell's Bells, Bad Penny, Angry Angel, Blanco Diablo and High
5171900	5172900	Roller.
5172900	5177900	You've got, like I said, punches, kicks, unicorn butt slaps.
5177900	5180900	You win the best of three rounds.
5180900	5182900	You get a beer.
5182900	5183900	I want beer.
5183900	5188900	Actually, I have soju in my fridge anyway.
5188900	5190900	But it's novel.
5190900	5191900	It's novel.
5191900	5198900	And it was a good idea as an advertising gimmick.
5198900	5202900	It really is very gimmicky.
5202900	5208900	But how many people can say I beat my buddy at this fighting game and I got free beer
5208900	5210900	for it?
5210900	5215900	I mean, if anything, something like this could have caught on in other breweries.
5215900	5223900	You know, they were missing a big licensing opportunity.
5223900	5230900	But I mean, like, I would only play it if, like, the beer sample was a good beer.
5230900	5234900	Yeah, it's probably going to be a crappy beer that you get from this.
5234900	5235900	Well, it's there.
5235900	5236900	It's a microbrewery is what it was.
5236900	5239900	So the specific brewery had their their samples.
5239900	5244900	Like, what if, you know, Pyramid or BJ's had something like that, you know?
5244900	5247900	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised the place downtown is gone, isn't it?
5247900	5248900	It is.
5248900	5251900	I'm surprised that coin up downtown doesn't have this, though.
5251900	5254900	Well, but coin up isn't a microbrew.
5254900	5255900	True.
5255900	5259900	They but they do offer a selection of local beers on staff.
5259900	5260900	Yeah.
5260900	5262900	But it's not going to be the same thing.
5262900	5264900	Like they don't do beer flights or something like that.
5264900	5265900	All right.
5265900	5267900	This trailer is only a minute long and I've seen it three times now.
5267900	5268900	So I'm going to go to the video there.
5268900	5272900	And to tell pod culture ultimate man cave.
5272900	5274900	What's with the gendering of this?
5274900	5276900	This is a Jamie Cade.
5276900	5277900	Jamie wants one in her house.
5277900	5280900	So really, I just want some beer.
5281900	5282900	All right.
5282900	5283900	I'll fight you for it.
5283900	5284900	All right.
5284900	5287900	I have a I think I have a sapro black in my fridge.
5287900	5288900	All right.
5288900	5289900	There it is.
5289900	5290900	Your classic game of the week.
5290900	5292900	The last bar fighter.
5292900	5294900	Good, good pick.
5294900	5296900	You fooled me, dark soccer.
5296900	5299900	I didn't even realize it was a flag, but it makes perfect sense.
5299900	5300900	All right.
5300900	5302900	I fooled you once.
5302900	5303900	All right.
5303900	5309900	Let's get to some rapid fire news and we'll quickly talk about some other things that are going on in the industry.
5310900	5312900	Who's starting us off tonight?
5312900	5313900	I think Loki.
5313900	5314900	Yeah.
5314900	5322900	So apparently Activision has even more studios working on Call of Duty now.
5322900	5326900	Apparently, there has been some report of layoffs for Toys for Bob, but that's not actually true.
5326900	5330900	It says there's not been a reduction in personnel recently at the studio.
5330900	5335900	Development team is operating fully and has a number of full time openings at this time.
5335900	5338900	And this is a continuing support on Crash Bandicoot 4.
5338900	5342900	It's about time and provide additional support to Call of Duty.
5342900	5349900	As of right now, they have almost all of the Activision Studios are working on Call of Duty.
5349900	5353900	So Toys for Bob are Toys for Bob is working on Warzone season three content.
5353900	5358900	Raven Software has been a support studio for Call of Duty since 2010.
5358900	5361900	Activision Shanghai is working on Call of Duty online.
5361900	5364900	Demonware is doing server support.
5364900	5370900	High Moon Studios is supporting Call of Duty as well.
5370900	5373900	Benox has been working on Call of Duty since Black Ops 3.
5373900	5378900	And Infinity War, Treyarch, Sledgehammer have been developing Call of Duty games.
5378900	5381900	So it's all Call of Duty all the time.
5381900	5393900	And then as we were talking about some updates for Among Us, there's another popular game that's streamed on Twitch as well.
5393900	5395900	Fall Guys, you may remember that.
5395900	5403900	It was supposed to be coming to consoles or more consoles, I should say, recently, including the Xbox and Switch.
5403900	5407900	However, that has been delayed again.
5407900	5413900	So now there is I don't think any update on when it's coming out.
5413900	5417900	But this is the delay gives our teams time to add features like cross play.
5417900	5426900	So when we add new feature or so when we add new platforms, players will be able to stumble in harmony with their power, regardless of platform or choice.
5426900	5428900	So that's what they're spending time on right now.
5428900	5434900	But no word yet on one when we will see the game come to those consoles.
5435900	5441900	All right, let's move on to Dark Soccer and what you have for rapid fire news.
5441900	5444900	I'm actually cheering some bits right now for our hype train.
5444900	5449900	Yes. Big, big, big thanks to you guys in chat for your generosity.
5449900	5452900	I'm always blushing. I love hype trains.
5452900	5456900	Yeah, it's it's and that also puts us on the front page of Twitch for a short period of time.
5456900	5461900	So I know I never know if anyone actually comes from the front page and lurks in Twitch.
5461900	5469900	I never know if anyone actually comes from the front page and lurks in chat to see because what a what a weird thing this is because we're not playing any video game.
5469900	5472900	We're just talking about gaming culture and video games and all that good stuff.
5472900	5477900	So hello to any people in five different Discord channels when we start.
5477900	5479900	Oh, that's great. Thank you.
5479900	5483900	Yeah. You know, you know, that's that's the funny thing about you having the increased Twitch presence.
5483900	5489900	And that's probably one thing. I mean, you got to be careful because it's actually really tacky to promote yourself as someone else's Twitch channel.
5489900	5493900	But if someone asks, then it's yeah, it's a good way to get the word out.
5493900	5498900	Well, that's exactly it. But a lot of people have on their Discord now like promote your or when you go live.
5498900	5501900	Yeah. Yeah. No, that is a that's a great way to do it.
5501900	5506900	Like the Dragon Con digital media track has something like that.
5506900	5509900	And I know Bobby's really good about promoting on there, except I always flaw.
5509900	5515900	I need to but I'm I'm doing a lot over here to get the show going.
5515900	5518900	I need an intern. We need a new intern is what we need.
5518900	5521900	You know what? Because, you know, Drew, you're retired.
5521900	5524900	Drew Drew's like in his 30s now. He can't be an intern.
5524900	5529900	Well, he can be, you know, Drew retired to be a cat dad ages, ages irrelevant.
5529900	5537900	But I think we need a new intern that that will help promote on social media and all that stuff anyway.
5537900	5541900	But then I feel guilty because I'm like, oh, but then you're asking someone to get paid and exposure and all that stuff.
5541900	5545900	But at the same time, I'll pay you double what I make.
5545900	5548900	Nothing. So it's a labor of love.
5548900	5554900	That is it is what it is. So anyway, if anyone's like seriously interested in helping to do some of that stuff,
5554900	5561900	reach out to us at our online because that would that would actually mean a lot anyway.
5561900	5570900	In the meantime, so. So from from my rapid fire, Konami has said that they are not attending E3 2021.
5570900	5574900	They even have any games. Can I finish?
5574900	5577900	Let her finish and you might find out.
5577900	5583900	Because they are in, quote, deep development on a number of key projects, end quote.
5583900	5587900	They made a public statement on it. In fact, I'll read the statement due to timing.
5587900	5589900	We will not be ready to present at E3 this year.
5589900	5593900	We want to reassure our fans that we are in deep development on a number of key projects.
5593900	5596900	So please stay tuned for some updates in the coming months.
5596900	5600900	While we are not participating this year, we have great respect for the ESA.
5600900	5603900	We know that 2021 will be a great success.
5603900	5610900	We will continue to support the ESA and wish the best to all participants in this year's show.
5610900	5616900	You get your answer, Loki. Ice skeptical.
5616900	5620900	But yes, that was a very solid snake level grunt.
5620900	5625900	It's metal. You're confirmed.
5625900	5629900	I how many platforms are they bringing Frogger to now?
5630900	5632900	Yeah, it's all mobile games in development, I'm sure.
5632900	5635900	I will give this to SSJ100 Matt in our chat.
5635900	5637900	At least they're not coming with BS hype footage.
5637900	5640900	You know what? Let's give them that.
5640900	5643900	At least they're not coming to lie.
5643900	5648900	So, let's all praise Konami for not lying.
5648900	5650900	I guess is what I'm saying.
5650900	5653900	Let's praise them for the bare minimum.
5653900	5655900	You tried.
5655900	5656900	Alright.
5656900	5665900	Anyway, we know that Yoshinori Ono left Capcom, but you know what he left for?
5665900	5671900	He is the president and COO now of Delightworks.
5671900	5677900	They're founder and president before Akihito Shoji.
5677900	5681900	Actually, I think he's retiring.
5681900	5688900	So yeah, Ono is now going to be the head honcho there.
5688900	5694900	Good for him because he's such a pleasant person to see at a lot of these events like at E3 and things like that.
5694900	5697900	I'm glad that he'll still be in the industry.
5697900	5700900	I've heard some weird things about whatever went down at Capcom.
5700900	5704900	I'm glad he's going to stay a part of this industry at the end of the day.
5704900	5708900	He's just a joy to watch speak and things like that.
5708900	5713900	So yeah, that's all I have to say on that.
5713900	5715900	Alright, that's it for Rapid Fire News.
5715900	5719900	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5719900	5722900	Loki, we'll start with you. What's coming out in the US this week?
5722900	5724900	We got a few things.
5724900	5728900	So, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is coming to Xbox One.
5728900	5731900	We've got Wreckfest on PlayStation 5.
5731900	5736900	Skate City on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5736900	5744900	Resident Evil Village on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Stadia.
5744900	5745900	And that's it.
5745900	5747900	Alright, traveling to Japan.
5747900	5753900	You know, oftentimes when there is a slow week on releases, I'm like, is it because it's Golden Week in Japan?
5753900	5758900	This is the week where, yes, it is Golden Week in Japan.
5758900	5765900	However, there is one big release on the PlayStation 4 and 5 that's happening on May 8th, which I think is technically after it's over anyway.
5765900	5767900	And that is Resident Evil Village.
5767900	5772900	But otherwise, it's a slow week and this is the week where Golden Week really is to blame for that.
5772900	5776900	But I hope everybody in Japan is having a lovely week with all the holidays this week.
5776900	5778900	Dark Soccer, how about the UK?
5778900	5781900	So, only a handful of things.
5781900	5785900	On May 5th is Evergate for Switch.
5785900	5792900	Also for Switch on the 6th is Pixel Puzzle Adventures plus Picto Quest Puzzle Bundle.
5793900	5800900	On the 7th, the Nintendo Switch Lite Blue comes out and also Resident Evil Village.
5800900	5802900	Alright.
5802900	5806900	Well, I think we have some more stories to get into here.
5806900	5808900	So, we are going to get into our next story.
5808900	5811900	Loki, why don't you start us off here?
5811900	5816900	Yeah, so Sony has actually begun selling the PlayStation 5 in China.
5817900	5827900	That's huge news because typically China hasn't really had game consoles there because of their lockdown and like I think these different electronic devices.
5827900	5829900	Or they do, they come out in different ways.
5829900	5834900	Like the whole Nintendo Nvidia thing, right?
5834900	5838900	Nvidia Shield that had like, what was it, Wii U games?
5838900	5840900	You know, Wii games on it.
5840900	5842900	Yeah, it was Wii games. It was like way after the fact.
5842900	5846900	But, you know, still it's, you know, there's a few people that live in China.
5846900	5856900	It's a very big, so anytime you have a big console release, it's a big deal because China is just such a large market.
5856900	5862900	Right, exactly. So, it's going on sale here pretty soon.
5863900	5870900	Looks like on May 15th is when that's planning on going on sale.
5870900	5874900	They're going to have the digital only version and of course the disc version available as well.
5874900	5876900	Hopefully scalpers don't eat that up.
5876900	5883900	I don't know what the scalper situation is in China, but it's not good over here.
5883900	5891900	Well, and certainly a lot of people are going to be asking, you know, well, wait a minute, how's that going to deal with the supply issues they're having in the rest of the world?
5891900	5898900	Well, I mean, you know, everybody should be able to play PlayStation 5, so I hope that question isn't coming up too much.
5898900	5899900	Right.
5899900	5901900	But I'm sure people are going to be asking it.
5901900	5907900	It's like, well, can't they wait to launch it in China so they can get some of those parts, you know, in other things?
5907900	5915900	But there also might be people that may try to import one to have a, but that wouldn't really work either, would it?
5915900	5921900	You can't just like switch a PS5 you buy that's intended for the Chinese market.
5921900	5924900	You can't just flip a switch and make it a North American PS5, right?
5924900	5926900	It's not going to work that way.
5926900	5939900	I don't know if that's necessarily the case, because I think, I don't think that they have those necessarily locked down for regions, but maybe.
5939900	5942900	But the import, the importing costs would be crazy for one.
5942900	5944900	Yes, well, it's the equivalent.
5944900	5950900	So like, for example, the disc version right now is the equivalent of about six hundred three US dollars.
5950900	5953900	It's thirty eight ninety nine one.
5953900	5961900	And then also the PlayStation five, the digital only versions about four hundred seventy nine dollars or it's three thousand ninety nine one.
5961900	5964900	So.
5964900	5971900	It's I don't know, I right now, they're releasing like a few games available for that.
5971900	5978900	There it's three games right now, Sackboy, Ratchet and Clank and Genshin Impact.
5978900	5982900	I don't know if necessarily we're going to have a lot of people importing that.
5982900	5987900	So I think that would make it, I don't know, maybe import if you can get it legitimately and import it.
5987900	5990900	It might be cheaper than some of the scalpers out there. I don't know.
5990900	5992900	I don't know. No, I just wouldn't do it. Yeah, I wouldn't either.
5992900	5996900	I just wait for eventually it's got to be easier to find on shelves here.
5996900	5999900	You just have to wait, resist the urge to buy from scalpers.
5999900	6002900	But since we're not in the holiday period, it should be easier to do that.
6002900	6009900	I think a lot of people that don't pay attention to those sorts of things are like, you know, parents that just have to get one for their kids and they don't care.
6009900	6012900	They'll pay the scalper fees. But that tends to happen more around the holidays.
6012900	6018900	I mean, I guess birthdays can happen at any time, but that's why you see it happen so much more often at the end of the year, I think.
6018900	6033900	Yeah. All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about this interesting story, which has to do with Riot Games and something that they are doing for one of their game that they released, I think, relatively recently, Valorant.
6033900	6049900	They're going to be recording the voice communications in that game to catch people that are being very, very naughty, meaning, you know, things like racist and other things that just, you know, grow up and don't do those things online or anywhere.
6049900	6053900	So Riot has announced that they are going to be updating their privacy policy.
6053900	6063900	They're going to record and evaluate reported player voice communication in Valorant, which I believe did come out some time ago, but it's an update to their policy in this.
6063900	6080900	In a statement, they said, in order for us to take action against players who use voice comms to harass others, use hate speech or otherwise disrupt your experience, we need to know what those players are saying, which is why moving forward, we'll need the ability to analyze voice data.
6080900	6093900	They have explained the way that this works. The company will not be actively listening to players. They're only going to record data if a report is filed, although I'm sure that's not going to stop a lot of tinfoil hat people from thinking a different way.
6093900	6104900	But at the same time, you know, Xbox Live could be listening to you, PlayStation, the Nintendo app could be listening to you if you want to believe any of those things.
6105900	6118900	Riot says when a player submits a report for disruptive or offensive behavior and voice comms, the relevant audio data will be stored in your account's registered region and evaluated to see if our behavior agreement was violated.
6118900	6125900	I think it's more accurate that they are recording it always. It's just they're going to retain it if there's a complaint filed.
6125900	6133900	OK, fair enough. And so whether or not they find a problem, they will delete the audio after they review. So what do you guys think about that?
6133900	6140900	I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to think I don't like them being nosy like that. But at the same time.
6140900	6147900	You know, you go into any business, any business, you can have the expectation that you're being recorded on a security camera.
6147900	6158900	Right. Or just any service that you're using nowadays and even the ones that say they aren't capturing your data, they're capturing your data because they want to learn, you know, they could sell that information, too.
6158900	6166900	They can anonymize it and sell like, you know, do searches like whatever about valiant or valorant players talking about, you know.
6166900	6171900	Yeah. How many times have they mentioned Gfuel, you know, like important data.
6171900	6180900	So, yeah. And I think I think they could already be, you know, using that data for things you don't want them to use it for.
6180900	6186900	So for them to use it to effectively moderate things, I think I don't I don't see the issue.
6186900	6194900	I don't. In fact, I actually I dare I say I kind of like it because I feel like it's going to give some oomph to some of the things that get reported.
6194900	6200900	Not that I play Valorant, but yet or at this time, you never know. Sometimes I find games years later.
6200900	6201900	Hello, Dead by Daylight.
6201900	6208900	Well, it could also help with like false reporting because you may have folks that are just reporting something to get back at somebody.
6208900	6212900	Right. You know, this way they can validate that.
6212900	6216900	ActDeft in chat says I'm not totally OK with it, but I'm not against it either.
6216900	6218900	And it's probably more focused to voice pattern recognition.
6218900	6222900	Yeah. I mean, I understand like where it's like this is a little weird. It does seem a little.
6222900	6229900	But, you know, at the same time, if you think about it, you're recorded in any business you go into in the world at the same time.
6229900	6236900	And it's for very similar reasons that if you decide to start a fight, you're on camera and they'll be able to show that you did it.
6236900	6245900	Right. So I think that's where my brain kind of goes with it and why I'm like, you know, and again, I'm like, if they wanted to record us now, they they already could be doing that.
6245900	6250900	And, you know, I've talked about this and, you know, I know people try to say you're just making it up.
6250900	6257900	You're imagining it. And maybe I am. But it is awfully weird that I might talk about something and then suddenly it shows up as a Facebook ad later.
6257900	6263900	It's just weird. It's why all the time, you know, and people say, well, it's because you searched for it.
6263900	6268900	You know, you didn't realize you were searching for it or you tweeted about it and it picked up on the tweet.
6268900	6278900	I know there's just some it's it's it's it's that whole thing where I can't prove it's anything, but it's something.
6278900	6286900	That's what it is. Dijerama S in chat says, when I worked at NBCUniversal, all calls were recorded.
6286900	6294900	We had someone call the help desk screaming and yelling at one of us. They pulled the recording, checked it, and she was reported to her manager.
6294900	6299900	You're right. Any time you use equipment that belongs at a business or a place you work, they can record.
6299900	6305900	If you use your work computer to look at porn, they'll know because they're watching.
6305900	6311900	So don't visit Pornhub on your computer. And now that I said Pornhub, enjoy the ad you're going to see later on today.
6311900	6317900	They never advertise that. You're right. They don't. They don't have to.
6317900	6323900	Let's be real. Actdeft in chat says whispers tacos to Rob's phone.
6323900	6328900	I I would be fine if my if I got nothing but tacos advertised to me on Facebook.
6328900	6336900	I wish it's the stuff that they show on Wish where you're like, what the fuck did I say to get that to show up in my ads or just like weird stuff?
6336900	6344900	Like the worst thing is like when I bought something like I went to a site and I bought the thing and then they're advertising me the same thing.
6344900	6347900	It's like I already bought that. Why are you you're wasting your time.
6347900	6350900	It's like I'm not going to buy another LG fridge or something like that.
6350900	6361900	It's like I've already own one. The fun wish one for me is getting like drag accessories like breastplates and butts and hip pads.
6361900	6368900	I'm like, I don't need any of that. I have that already. I came I came with it attached.
6368900	6377900	Bobby in chat, you know, try to be the voice of realism, saying if they were recording your voice and sending it up, either your phone battery would drain quickly or your data caps would be hit quickly.
6377900	6381900	And also, people would inspect the network packets and find the voice files being sent up to the service.
6381900	6384900	What if it's all happening on your phone? Your phone can dictate.
6384900	6388900	Like if you open up the notes app and say, hey, dictate this message.
6388900	6392900	It'll it'll put it in text. Maybe it's not sending the voices.
6392900	6398900	It's just something. Their voice to text, voice to text stuff is pretty advanced now.
6398900	6403900	I doubt that they would be sending the actual, you know, recordings.
6403900	6408900	Yeah, something. That's why I don't have the Facebook app on my phone anymore. I don't need it.
6408900	6413900	Also, I don't need it. Why do I need the Facebook app? I don't. I can just go to Facebook dot com on the Web.
6413900	6418900	And even then, like I should I shouldn't need to live on Facebook that much.
6418900	6422900	You know, anyway. Yeah. All right. Moving on.
6422900	6429900	Dark Sakura, instead of our crazy conspiracy theories, let's talk about some very real deals, right?
6429900	6434900	Yes. Well, we know that May the fourth is coming up and we know that it sounds like May the fourth.
6434900	6439900	So it's basically Star Wars Day. May the fourth be with you.
6439900	6445900	So at any rate, of course, Lucasfilm slash Disney takes advantage of this.
6445900	6454900	So of course, you know, we we heard that Jedi Fallen Order is getting an upgrade soon.
6454900	6460900	You can get up to 70 percent off the standard and deluxe editions of the current versions of the game.
6460900	6464900	Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Origin and Steam.
6464900	6473900	And this is going for May 28th to May 12th and then also started on April 30th going through May 11th.
6473900	6479900	You can also get up to 50 percent off the EA Star Wars triple bundle, which is Star Wars Squadrons,
6479900	6484900	Jedi Fallen Order deluxe edition and Star Wars Battlefront two celebration edition.
6484900	6492900	There's also other ones listed in steam. A few of them were on Mac and I was tempted, but I resisted.
6492900	6497900	Resistance is futile. Oh, wait, that's Star Trek. Star Trek. When Star Trek Day.
6497900	6503900	Oh, wait, actually, that's redundant. We just had it. It was that they did the first they do it on first contact day.
6503900	6507900	I don't know if there was gaming sales, but they did all the Star Trek news that day.
6507900	6511900	So I guess I just answered my own question. We get is the resistance.
6511900	6516900	That's true. The Rebel Alliance. All right.
6516900	6521900	Well, it's it's cute that they they made an unofficial holiday of sorts out of May the fourth.
6521900	6526900	So I think it's it's cute. Well, and don't forget Revenge of the Fifth. That's right.
6526900	6534900	And it's a good thing to come out of those damn prequels. It's the one day I can post like my favorite meme, which is like it's a picture of the Dalek.
6534900	6538900	You post it with the text. It says, oh, my God, it's R2D2. I loved him in Star Trek.
6538900	6544900	Like it's that's like the one day you can post that meme. All right.
6544900	6548900	Oh, Rob. Oh, me. Moving on.
6548900	6556900	You Loki. Yeah, I'm hoping for like at least some season two of The Mandalorian or not.
6556900	6563900	Season two, season three Mandalorian. Maybe you'll get a sneak peek. I'm hoping that's my hope.
6563900	6568900	So anyways, we've got some it's the end of an era.
6568900	6572900	I mean, it kind of been ending for a while, but now it's officially dead.
6572900	6578900	So after the last official games magazine is having its final issue.
6578900	6585900	So the official PlayStation magazine UK was the last official game company magazine.
6585900	6590900	And they have their final issue going out so very soon.
6590900	6597900	So. That's unfortunate. OPM actually started was it back in 1995.
6597900	6607900	So it's been a while, but honestly, and this is going to sound horrible, but I thought all the magazines were gone already anyway.
6607900	6612900	Well, this but to be fair, this is in the UK, you know, so it's not something I exactly would see it over here.
6612900	6616900	Like I used to see this all the time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was the thing.
6617900	6622900	I'm sorry, I'm thinking borders. But yeah, I'd always pick up like the UK ones.
6622900	6628900	I always like the better. Yeah. So but it's it's still sad, obviously, you know.
6628900	6634900	I'm this retro gamer. Yeah. It's just a lot of the magazines just are going online.
6634900	6638900	And it's just a reality of the whole print media, which is which is sad.
6638900	6644900	You know, I wonder if there will be some type of renaissance, though, just like we're seeing, you know, like limited run games,
6644900	6647900	you know, that will see some type of renaissance for magazines and books.
6647900	6656900	I guess we do. We I feel like every other week I'm getting some type of thing on my email for some type of Kickstarter that's for a book,
6656900	6662900	you know, or something that's a compilation of, you know, stuff for some video game or something.
6662900	6667900	So I guess there's always a renaissance in that regard. All right.
6667900	6675900	Well, last but not least, on our official list of stories for tonight, we have a story about shoes.
6675900	6679900	Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shoes. These shoes are three hundred dollars.
6679900	6685900	Actually, I don't get them. They're not three hundred dollars. They're one hundred and ten dollars expensive.
6685900	6692900	They are official PlayStation five shoes. They are Nike's PlayStation five theme shoes.
6692900	6700900	It's the PG five cross PS five. And yeah, there's a PlayStation five set from Paul George,
6700900	6707900	who in twenty eighteen kind of talked up PlayStation fandom while talking about a shoe that had lights and sounds linked to Sony's console.
6707900	6714900	So some Instagram pictures popped up that this PG five cross PS five.
6714900	6719900	And they actually say those on the little back kind of like hook things for like if you hang shoes up or whatever.
6719900	6729900	They show them a little back hooks there. They are on Instagram where they will go on sale later this month for one hundred and ten dollars.
6729900	6734900	There have been other PlayStation Nike collaborations that were very limited.
6734900	6738900	So, you know, you want to talk about scalpers. The shoe market's full of them, too.
6738900	6743900	So look out. But good luck if you decide you want to get some of these PlayStation five shoes.
6743900	6751900	They are cute. I mean, they have their blue, a very nice color and the little Nike swoosh, of course, and all that good stuff.
6751900	6757900	I wish they would light up, too, but I guess I guess that would make them cost three hundred dollars for real then.
6757900	6761900	So as they will on the second hand market, so it's fine.
6761900	6766900	Yeah. As you know, Matt is chiming in saying Adidas is coming out with Lego shoes.
6766900	6771900	I didn't know that. That's cool. Do you actually happens when you step on?
6771900	6775900	What happens when you stick on a Lego? You pick it up and you keep it with your shoes get bigger.
6775900	6779900	That's how you make heels.
6779900	6782900	You have to put the shoes together. Do they snap together?
6782900	6788900	It'll be it'll be like I was at Lord Business in the Lego movie.
6788900	6792900	All right. Let's get to the part of the show where you guys can drive a little bit.
6792900	6799900	It is our listener roundtable. If you guys have any comments in our chat, please put them in there and we'll get to some questions and stuff.
6799900	6806900	I believe we do have an email, at least one tonight over at participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place you can send your emails.
6806900	6811900	And Dark Soccer will step into the gaming, not the gaming vault, but the well, maybe the mailbag is in the gaming vault.
6811900	6815900	I don't know where it's kept, but she's going to look at the mailbag and tiny bag.
6815900	6819900	OK, it's a very tiny bag tonight and pull out the emails again.
6819900	6824900	It's one of those micro purses, except it's not in their maze. It's when someone got on wish.
6824900	6829900	Again, that email address participate at Orange Laundry dot com. Dark Soccer, take it away.
6829900	6840900	Our one email comes from Robert M. Is there any reason Midway or more accurately Warner isn't releasing arcade collections for modern consoles or PC?
6840900	6845900	You know what my answer is? I'm not fucking Midway.
6845900	6849900	I don't know. Was that it? The email? That's it.
6849900	6853900	OK. Well, of course, you're not Midway. You don't know.
6853900	6858900	But I bet I bet if he sent this email to Midway, well, Midway's not around, but you know what I mean.
6858900	6862900	But if he sent this email to Warner, who now has all the Midway licenses, I bet they wouldn't even reply.
6862900	6869900	So I think he has to come to us that keep tabs on the gaming industry to try to figure out, like, why, why isn't this happening?
6869900	6874900	Why, why is Warner not, you know, it's not profitable. End of story.
6874900	6884900	They wait. They're going to wait right to the end and release something at the right moment financially for them to release it.
6884900	6888900	There you go. I think something still could happen.
6888900	6893900	You know, you got to track records like there have been what they're doing with it.
6893900	6897900	Well, at least with some of them, they're releasing them as arcade one up cabinets.
6897900	6900900	There is that. Oh, that's true. OK.
6900900	6906900	Although I wish they would hurry up with really seeing San Francisco Russia as an arcade cabinet.
6906900	6912900	But yeah, I mean, I know like Rampage and I'm trying to think what other stuff they had.
6912900	6915900	I know Rampage just sticks out as one of the ones that they had there.
6915900	6921900	And you know what? It's not just those. It's the mini mini arcades, too. Like this one I have here.
6921900	6926900	This is a Ms. Pac-Man, which actually Ms. Pac-Man is a mid, wasn't Ms. Pac-Man a Midway thing, wasn't it?
6926900	6932900	Yeah. Yeah. So technically this is another way that they're using Midway right now is these mini, mini cabinets.
6932900	6938900	So they are licensing out the properties. And that's Loki. I wouldn't I would have thought of that, even though that's so obvious.
6938900	6944900	So kudos to you. You're right. So those arcade one up cabinets and then other types of collectibles.
6944900	6953900	And I want to say I've also seen like like joust like, you know, when they have those bundles, it's like pins, stickers, things like that.
6953900	6960900	They sell it for the loot box things. I've seen that for Midway stuff as well.
6960900	6966900	So I kind of think that's where they're putting their and Loki's right on with this.
6966900	6970900	That's where they're putting their properties right now. But I know the emailer wants to know,
6970900	6975900	where's my PlayStation for my PlayStation five Midway arcade classics collection?
6975900	6978900	I think that's what they haven't done one of those in like years. They haven't.
6978900	6981900	Why not play it on a system that you actually have it for?
6981900	6990900	Well, there is that. But there's also, don't forget, the last thing I remember them doing was the Lego thing.
6990900	6996900	They had a pack in the Lego dimensions. They had a Midway pack.
6996900	7001900	And you could actually play some of the classic arcade games in that pack. You remember that?
7001900	7005900	That's the last thing I remember them doing. Yeah.
7006900	7008900	But that's no longer available either.
7008900	7015900	Well, no, unless you you might get lucky at a discount warehouse type, like a 99 cent store or something.
7015900	7020900	But I think even a lot of those are long gone at this point. So, yeah.
7020900	7022900	Looking at chat for some comments here.
7022900	7025900	Dargesuya in chat says, I mean, I'd love to see a new collection.
7025900	7030900	I think his best bet are the arcade one ups that have the Midway stuff on it.
7030900	7035900	Excuse me. POGCULTURE says, still winning a Spy Hunter cabinet.
7035900	7040900	Dargesuya says, the last collection for that I saw was on PlayStation 3 360.
7040900	7046900	I don't think they did them on 360. I think you're thinking original Xbox and PS2.
7046900	7052900	Because I'm almost positive I've got one of those collections just off camera over here.
7052900	7057900	And it's an original Xbox. If they did any of those on Xbox 360 have been Xbox Live Arcade.
7057900	7059900	I don't think they actually had a collection.
7059900	7061900	And that's what I was going to get to. They were piecemealed.
7061900	7066900	One of the very first Xbox arcade releases was Joust. Remember that?
7066900	7068900	And then there was Robotron 2084.
7068900	7072900	And a lot of those classic Midway titles followed there.
7072900	7075900	So that's what you got on 360.
7075900	7078900	And I think some of those came to PlayStation 3.
7078900	7080900	And that's probably what Dargesuya is remembering.
7081900	7087900	Are those piecemeal like onesie twosie games that you could buy there.
7087900	7090900	But yeah, they had some really bang up collections.
7090900	7093900	There was the Midway arcade collections one, two, and they did do a three.
7093900	7096900	Three was harder to find and it was all racing games if I remember right.
7096900	7098900	Was that Hydro Thunder and that stuff?
7098900	7105900	Yeah, it did. Because I had it. I actually had a PC version of it. I got it free.
7105900	7109900	So they had like Hydro Thunder. There was San Francisco Rush.
7110900	7113900	I don't think they had Off-Road Thunder, which is too bad because that game is awesome.
7116900	7120900	God, I can't remember what else. I don't know if Rush 2489 was in that. It may have been.
7123900	7128900	Okay, I stand corrected. There was a collection on 360 and PS3.
7128900	7134900	It was called Midway Arcade Origins. I guess it never crossed my desk.
7135900	7138900	Okay, fair enough. Y'all got it. That's why we have a live chat.
7138900	7144900	Y'all got me. S2 and Hunter Matt says, we're beating around the bush here. Just bring back game room.
7144900	7146900	Solves all the problems.
7146900	7149900	I wish. That would be amazing.
7149900	7152900	I don't know. I think maybe the tides passed for that sort of thing though.
7152900	7154900	No, it's never, never passed.
7154900	7160900	I want an arcade one up that has that type of thing built into it. So I don't have to buy like seven cabinets, you know.
7161900	7170900	They have, you know, I thought that there was like another company doing something similar that where you could purchase games, but maybe not.
7170900	7176900	Okay, ActDeft points out the collection is compatible on Xbox One. That's interesting.
7176900	7180900	That means it plays on Xbox One S as well and X. So that's it. Maybe I'll have to check that out.
7180900	7184900	So I guess there's your very long winded answer to your question.
7184900	7189900	You got to have backwards compatibility and go all the way back to Midway Arcade Origins.
7189900	7193900	But will they do a new collection? I don't know. It's hard to say.
7193900	7200900	I think I think right now it's more about they're making a lot of money in the retro cabinet space, whether it be large cabinet or tiny cabinet.
7200900	7203900	And I think that's where they're going to stay for a little while.
7203900	7209900	So. All right. Let's get into any other last minute stories. I don't know if Loki has anything else.
7209900	7213900	And of course, if you guys have any comments, put them in our chat room.
7213900	7218900	Also, one more shout out for the mailbag. Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com.
7218900	7223900	I do have one thing. So Epic Games has purchased ArtStation.
7223900	7228900	So it's a website I think Digital Arts can use to share their artwork that they have.
7228900	7233900	And now they have apparently there's like a commercial element to that.
7233900	7239900	I think they're going to be tying that with Unreal Engine to provide art assets or something like that.
7239900	7247900	But interesting to see that be purchased by Epic Games.
7247900	7251900	All right. So somebody said something in chat. I got to go back to the Midway thing because this is huge.
7251900	7257900	I totally forgot about this. OK. S2100 Matt in chat says, speaking of which, what's going on with the ant stream?
7257900	7261900	Is it still going on and strong? And the answer is, yeah, it's still going.
7261900	7266900	And by the way, do you know what game they just added to ant stream about two weeks ago?
7266900	7272900	Joust. Huh. So my dumb ass forgot that.
7272900	7276900	That is another place where the Midway games appear to be going.
7276900	7281900	Oh, yeah. Because Mortal Kombat got added to the service like a while ago.
7281900	7287900	So a few of those are showing up on ant stream. But it is weird because ant stream.
7287900	7292900	If I remember right in chat, correct me if I'm wrong. I Kickstarter backed ant stream.
7292900	7296900	So I'm able to use it. They still don't have an Xbox one X client, though, which is sad.
7296900	7299900	I can only do it on PC. And that is weird to me.
7299900	7302900	I don't know why they don't have a one X client when they have an Xbox one client.
7302900	7305900	I thought everything should automatically run, but for whatever reason, it seems weird.
7305900	7310900	It is very weird to me. But.
7310900	7313900	Ant stream, I don't think is still available in the US.
7313900	7318900	I think it is still only a UK thing unless you were a Kickstarter backer like me.
7318900	7324900	Hmm. I could be wrong. And that's why I need chat to help me out, because my my perspective,
7324900	7330900	I don't know, because since I was a Kickstarter backer and my my two years finally runs out like next month,
7330900	7336900	I think, and I probably will re up for another year. So we'll see.
7336900	7339900	Bobby Blackwell says my accounts disabled now. The Kickstarter is only for two years.
7339900	7348900	Mine was also for two years and I'm still active. So I think it dies in June, if I remember right.
7348900	7355900	They added Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back on May the fourth or it's coming.
7355900	7361900	They added root beer, tapper and xenophobe. Root beer, tappers, another midway game.
7361900	7364900	I'm just looking I'm looking at their discord. I have their discord on my phone.
7364900	7368900	There's joust that they added not long ago. What else did they add?
7368900	7373900	Marble madness, space war. So they're still they're still going along there.
7373900	7377900	Elevator action returns. Oh, that was always there. That's a tournament they're talking about.
7377900	7382900	Rampage rampage they added not that long ago. So there's another answer.
7382900	7388900	So and stream is picking up some of those midway classics. Interesting.
7388900	7393900	There you go. There you go. All right.
7393900	7397900	I don't see any other comments in chat. Bobby says the two years ran out a while ago.
7397900	7400900	I swear I just played not that long ago and I was still able to get in there.
7400900	7404900	I thought it was a June thing. Yeah. S2M says it's still not in the U.S. yet.
7404900	7409900	I don't get that. It's weird that they have launched here. What's up with that?
7409900	7413900	All right. You had to get in on the Kickstarter or else maybe I won't even be able to renew stuff.
7413900	7422900	Yeah. All right. So real quick, I was going to say that Castlevania resurrection that was supposed to be for the Dreamcast has been dumped.
7422900	7429900	And it's available online now as part of the Sega Dreamcast info games preservation site.
7429900	7434900	So you can check out that unreleased game. I watched someone playing through it.
7434900	7440900	It was pretty amusing just that, like, there's complete lack of, like, falling animation in some places.
7440900	7445900	And you could just walk around and buy really early. Yeah. And like terrible collision.
7445900	7451900	Otherwise, it was it was pretty funny. And then that same track playing over and over. It was a demo version.
7451900	7457900	Right. So. All right. Well, we're getting here towards the end of the show.
7457900	7462900	So I was a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but it's a little bit I think because of the holiday week in Japan,
7462900	7468900	we probably just don't have as much news that's been coming out. And plus E3 is, you know, on the horizon.
7468900	7475900	And even though you have all these companies that are doing E3, I still think June is going to be the month when we really start to see a lot of news.
7475900	7480900	So that's going to happen sometimes. But I still want to thank you guys for tuning in and joining us this week,
7480900	7483900	whether you were listening on the podcast feed or you were here live with us on Twitch.
7483900	7488900	Thank you so much for being here and supporting Orange Onch Radio and listening to the whole program.
7488900	7493900	Really appreciate you guys. If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, tell a friend or to help us spread the word.
7493900	7497900	We are the show where every gamer has a voice. We need more voices here at the table with us.
7497900	7504900	So tell a friend a tweet goes a long way. Auto hosts of Vogue Network on Twitch goes a really long way.
7504900	7510900	Let me tell you. And yeah, thanks again for your guys's support. I saw a hype train going on earlier during the show.
7510900	7514900	You guys don't have to do that, but you do. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to work on creating content.
7514900	7522900	I will tell you what, just before the show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki, we're talking about another project we might take on very soon.
7522900	7527900	Nothing that's going to be taken away from OLR. It's going to be something extra.
7527900	7531900	So we'll talk a little bit about that very soon. I think we're going to start that.
7531900	7538900	So more to come on that soon. And this is directly a thank you for those of you that have really gone the extra mile with your participation.
7538900	7543900	We want to create more for you guys. So and there's there's there's a few things we have to get off our chest.
7543900	7550900	There's always some more things to talk about. So also, you don't have to support us financially.
7550900	7555900	But if you feel so inclined, we also have a store, Vogue Network dot com slash shop. Somebody just linked that in chat as well.
7555900	7561900	And we appreciate that. So. All right. Bobby says he's limited to one game in a 24 hour period.
7561900	7565900	So his account must have reverted. Shit. I guess maybe mine did, too. I don't know.
7565900	7571900	I have to look. I don't know. I thought I thought it was extended to June because there was like a beta.
7572900	7577900	I don't know. Whatever. I'll take his word for it. I mean, he's if he's limited, he's limited.
7577900	7580900	So that probably happened to me, too, because I don't think I did any more than two years.
7580900	7585900	All right. Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for tonight.
7585900	7594900	So I will start with Loki. Your final thought tonight. Final thought is I'm going to hopefully start working on episode two of my Let's Play series soon.
7594900	7597900	So look for that. Sounds good. Looking forward to it.
7597900	7601900	So while Dark Soccer and I have been doing more on Twitch, you've been doing more on YouTube.
7601900	7606900	And I think that's great. Get get in fact, all are everywhere.
7606900	7611900	All right. My final thought is, hey, killers and dead by daylight.
7611900	7617900	Stop winning by slugging everybody and try to try winning without no Ed.
7617900	7621900	All right. Well, I don't know. I have no Ed on Bubba, so I use it.
7621900	7625900	It's such a nasty thing to go up against, but I get it.
7625900	7629900	I've used it, too. All right. But the slugging. Stop it. All right.
7629900	7631900	Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought.
7631900	7638900	Well, make sure that you stay in because I'm going to be going live after after the show.
7638900	7644900	I'm going to be playing Fantasian. Because why not?
7645900	7654900	And also, I have my own YouTube channel that I've just got a couple of things uploaded on.
7654900	7659900	But it's just as Jamie Summers Dash Dark Sakura.
7659900	7666900	I will link it in chat if if people are interested in it.
7666900	7669900	But yeah, I am going to go ahead and hop off early.
7669900	7674900	I will not be here post credits as I am prepping to entertain you all with Fantasian.
7674900	7680900	All right. All right. And and those that are on the podcast feed, this is going to be on your personal channel.
7680900	7685900	So if they do want to see this after the fact, they can go to your personal channel because you don't have your videos locked to subs.
7685900	7691900	So you can watch that after the fact. Right. Right. My personal channel is DarkSakura underscore O.L.R.
7691900	7695900	Cool. All right. There we go. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
7695900	7698900	We will see you next week and talk about whatever news comes up in the next week.
7698900	7702900	Have fun gaming. Don't be toxic. Be nice to each other online.
7702900	7707900	And we will see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio. Good night, everybody.
7728900	7737900	Those of the staff of Orange Launch Radio or VOG Network, but you know, they were all still true.
7737900	7740900	See you next week.
7758900	7772900	The.
