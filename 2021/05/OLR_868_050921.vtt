WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.860
Electronic music has come a long way since the late 90s and early 2000s, and I am pumped

00:13.860 --> 00:17.300
to hear that Avex is bringing back its Cybertrance album series.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.960
The combination of Avex tracks, Toshiba EMI, and Konami's in-house tunes account for

00:20.960 --> 00:23.720
a huge amount of my teenage listening and enjoyment.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.220
My rose-colored glasses are on and vivid.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.460
The best part of everything being cyclical is when your favorites come back.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.900
This is my choice of hype for this week.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.060
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:34.060 --> 00:36.820
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where Every

00:36.820 --> 00:38.340
Gamer Has a Voice.

00:38.340 --> 00:42.940
Me too, Jason, except my early 20s.

00:42.940 --> 00:43.940
Anyway, hi, everybody.

00:43.940 --> 00:48.180
Hello, everyone out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:48.180 --> 00:50.480
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

00:50.480 --> 00:57.420
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again here with episode number 868 of

00:57.420 --> 01:01.780
our show for this May the 9th of 2021.

01:01.780 --> 01:08.260
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined via the magic of Discord during these quarantiny

01:08.260 --> 01:12.580
times with the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:12.580 --> 01:14.780
I wish someone would make me a quarantiny.

01:14.780 --> 01:16.740
I could use a little bit of both.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.180
I was just realizing I was trying to make up a word, and I don't think I did.

01:20.180 --> 01:28.860
I think I actually named a very popular beverage in these trying times, I'm sure.

01:28.860 --> 01:35.220
Well, I think that a bunch of people tried to copyright it to you, but I don't think

01:35.220 --> 01:39.100
that you can copyright the pain of others.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.700
Probably not, although I'm sure someone would try, that's for sure.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.700
Oh, you know someone's tried.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.740
How did the stream go after last week's show?

01:46.740 --> 01:50.440
You were playing some Fantasian for the very first time after last week's OLR.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
How was all that?

01:51.440 --> 01:53.900
I really like Fantasian.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.900
It's pretty good.

01:54.900 --> 02:02.720
I just think that I'm going to move that stream to Tuesday night because it's not super exciting,

02:02.720 --> 02:05.500
you know, but it's a good story.

02:05.500 --> 02:10.040
I've really been enjoying it, and I think I'm going to just do a little bit of it like

02:10.040 --> 02:11.040
every Tuesday.

02:11.040 --> 02:15.320
I actually have my schedule posted on Twitch now.

02:15.320 --> 02:19.320
Whether or not I adhere to it is a completely different story.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.720
That's why I don't post one because I know I won't adhere to it.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.300
Well, you know, that's not true because here at VOG Network, we've adhered to this Sunday

02:26.300 --> 02:31.620
night at six o'clock thing for, you know, coming up on 19 years, but it took a long

02:31.620 --> 02:39.160
time to really make that routine, you know, and a lot of people always ask, well, what

02:39.160 --> 02:41.000
would you do on Sunday night if OLR ended?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.300
And I'm like, I literally do not know.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.920
Like 19 years of my life, Sunday night is this.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.920
Like what am I supposed to say?

02:47.920 --> 02:48.920
It's ending?

02:48.920 --> 02:49.920
No, I'm just saying, people ask.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.920
I mean, but I'm just saying, it'll end?

02:51.920 --> 02:52.920
What?

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
Well.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
What words are you speaking?

02:54.920 --> 02:55.920
I don't know this reality.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.080
All good things come to an end eventually.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.880
I don't mean tomorrow or next week, but you know, you never know what's going to happen.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.880
Maybe if I get run over by a Mack truck.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.700
Let's not say those things, but you know, yeah, something could happen.

03:05.700 --> 03:06.700
You never know.

03:07.180 --> 03:11.780
We had some scares in the past and luckily we made it through unscathed and here we are

03:11.780 --> 03:13.300
19 years later.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.300
Yeah.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.140
And some of our listeners, hi listeners, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six

03:18.140 --> 03:23.420
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog

03:23.420 --> 03:27.700
network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and STA-100 Matt, so our listeners get in

03:27.700 --> 03:28.700
on this too.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.980
STA-100 Matt says, I don't remember my Sunday nights pre-OLR, kind of getting info watching

03:33.980 --> 03:36.740
Simpsons and scrambling to finish homework territory.

03:36.740 --> 03:37.740
Yeah.

03:37.740 --> 03:42.780
I'm trying to think of what my son, Oh, I remember my Sunday nights before OLR.

03:42.780 --> 03:45.660
I used to go to the goth club.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.540
I did on occasion too.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.540
True story.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.540
Yep.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.540
We used to go together.

03:50.540 --> 03:51.540
We were friends before OLR.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.580
So, uh, yeah, we used to go a lot.

03:53.580 --> 03:54.580
Yeah.

03:54.580 --> 04:00.020
But we, but we met through, uh, I met, I think I met Jessica before I met you.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.620
Um, probably.

04:01.620 --> 04:02.620
I don't remember.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.620
Exactly.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.260
Yeah.

04:05.260 --> 04:06.260
I was there that same day at golf land.

04:06.260 --> 04:11.340
I think when I thought that I had met you when we went to play Para Para.

04:11.340 --> 04:17.180
Yes, it was that, Oh, you met, you met probably a go on a girl, uh, a week or two prior or

04:17.180 --> 04:18.340
something before that happened.

04:18.340 --> 04:22.860
I think something like either that, or I met you both at the same time, but yeah, I met

04:22.860 --> 04:24.260
you guys over the Balinese.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.260
Yeah.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.700
And that would have literally been over 20 years ago at this point, which is crazy to

04:28.700 --> 04:29.700
think about.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.700
Isn't it?

04:30.700 --> 04:31.700
Oh my gosh.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.020
There was a lot of guest hosting on, uh, under sedation too long after that.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.020
Yep.

04:37.020 --> 04:40.820
That was the show I was on, um, concurrently with OLR in the beginning, but, um, before

04:40.820 --> 04:41.820
OLR.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.220
Uh, so yeah, it's fun, fun times.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.220
Anyway.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.700
Uh, I would also say hello to tech master Loki.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.020
I'm not sure if he's actually there.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
He's blacked out.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.020
I'm here.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.020
Hi.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.020
I'm just eating.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.020
So I figured we don't want to see that.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.020
Yeah, probably not.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.020
That's okay.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
Well, how are you Loki?

04:56.020 --> 04:59.140
I've been trying to stretch for time because I thought you were away from keyboard.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.140
My bad.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.140
That's all right.

05:01.580 --> 05:02.580
I'm here.

05:02.580 --> 05:03.580
I'm here.

05:03.580 --> 05:04.580
I can turn the camera on.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.620
I had to rush and do a bunch of things at the last minute.

05:07.620 --> 05:15.500
I had like two minutes to eat food and get the setup and then of course OBS and discord

05:15.500 --> 05:19.100
and my cam software decided to feud it out.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.740
So that delayed my time to have the, uh, yeah.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.740
Been there, done that.

05:24.740 --> 05:28.760
I've, I've, I've been there, done that scarf and down food before, uh, doing a live stream

05:28.760 --> 05:29.760
at one point.

05:29.880 --> 05:34.840
Well, of course everybody wants to know what you eat and, uh, the bacon ultimate cheeseburger.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
Of course.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
Yes.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.120
Cause I haven't had one of those in like a few weeks.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.680
So I figured, I figured why not?

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
Good job.

05:42.680 --> 05:48.520
About 15 minutes ago I was, uh, eating freshly smoked tri-tip.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.520
I don't get dinner till after OLR.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.880
I eat late on Sunday nights, so, um, you'll figure it was bacon.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
You'd be surprised.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.840
I don't eat that much bacon really.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.680
Um, given the opportunity.

05:59.680 --> 06:05.320
Yes, I will add bacon to the things, but I don't actually eat bacon that often anymore.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.600
So this is a bacon story.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.320
I promise yesterday I had the opportunity to see, um, grandpa Warcraft.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.160
For those of you that remember my old show, horde house, or if you ever listened to the

06:14.160 --> 06:18.800
starboard power coupling, which was here on VOG, you remember grandpa Matt, uh, from both

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
of those shows.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.760
And I got to see him yesterday, which was great because I really haven't seen a lot

06:23.760 --> 06:26.480
of people during all this, uh, quarantine stuff.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.480
But now that I'm fully vaccinated, he's fully vaccinated.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.000
We were able to hang out yesterday.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.720
Um, and by the way, so he has a, he has a new, um, cabin in the woods that he's at.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.340
And by the way, the cabin in the woods has a hot tub and wifi.

06:39.340 --> 06:43.380
So if we do want to do a VOG hot tub stream, we can probably do one.

06:43.380 --> 06:45.800
So I'm just going to throw that out there.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
We broke.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
He's great.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
He's still doing well.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.480
Thinking about him this morning, going to cut roses.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
Yeah.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
Love that bitch.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.280
For those of you who don't know, I live in his old house, so it was great to see him

06:57.280 --> 06:58.280
and everything.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.520
Uh, but we went to some nice little restaurant up in, uh, for, for those of you, uh, locals,

07:02.520 --> 07:06.400
Nevada city, which is the cute, cute little town up in the, you know, up in the Hills.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
Right.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.940
And, uh, they, they've shot hallmark movies up there.

07:08.940 --> 07:09.940
It's so cute.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.240
We went to one of the little bougie restaurants.

07:11.240 --> 07:17.320
So here's here, I'm, I promise I get to bacon, um, Alan, who is, he's lost, he's lost a lot

07:17.320 --> 07:19.380
of weight during this quarantine stuff.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.380
Many of us have gained.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.900
Alan is lost and he eats very well.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.700
Um, and he ordered as an appetizer, some Brussels sprouts.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.580
Now here's the thing I fucking, I fucking hate Brussels sprouts, but I ate these.

07:31.580 --> 07:32.580
Why?

07:32.580 --> 07:33.580
Why do you hate Brussels sprouts?

07:33.580 --> 07:34.580
They're delicious.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.580
Because they're fucking disgusting.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.560
Except you haven't had them cooked right.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.900
Can I finish my goddamn story?

07:40.900 --> 07:44.740
So the way the bacon's on them, then yes, yes.

07:44.740 --> 07:49.500
So I, but I actually ate the Brussels sprouts here because they, they roasted him, which

07:49.500 --> 07:52.560
was like, the only way I'll eat them is like doing the roasting thing.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.180
And then of course they put like bacon in mixed in with it and it was chef's kiss.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.180
Amazing.

07:58.180 --> 08:02.120
So how will you get Rob to eat Brussels sprouts roasted with bacon?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.120
That's the only way to do it.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.180
I eat my Brussels sprouts with a full pack of bacon in them and heavy cream and cheese

08:08.180 --> 08:09.860
and onions and garlic.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.420
But then I don't think it's really healthy anymore.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.820
Like it's totally keto.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.020
I mean, it's totally like no carbs.

08:16.020 --> 08:22.740
It's just, it's all of the calories and meat and fat, but it's, Oh my God, it's so good.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.460
Tiger class asking a very valid question.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.100
Is the internet good at the cabin?

08:26.100 --> 08:27.100
To which I found out.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.100
Yes.

08:28.100 --> 08:32.640
He gets gigabit up there, which like, I don't know who, why does a cabin in the woods get

08:32.640 --> 08:34.220
better internet than I do?

08:34.220 --> 08:35.220
I don't know.

08:35.220 --> 08:37.420
I was surprised at that too.

08:37.420 --> 08:40.500
I guess you probably have a lot of people running businesses out of their homes.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.920
I have no, that's blew my mind too.

08:42.920 --> 08:43.920
It really did.

08:43.920 --> 08:44.920
So, all right.

08:44.920 --> 08:50.280
Anyway, I actually have access to a hot tub in my neighborhood since my friend who is

08:50.280 --> 08:56.120
on Twitch is Amethyst Rose, which has a lovely large one at her house and has given me free

08:56.120 --> 08:57.960
rain to come over.

08:57.960 --> 09:03.640
So that may be a bonus stream in the future is the OLR hot tub stream, but don't, don't

09:03.640 --> 09:05.280
get it twisted.

09:05.280 --> 09:10.120
Like we're, we're there to literally sit in the hot tub and I'm keeping my shirt on cause

09:10.120 --> 09:12.080
a you don't need to see that on Twitch.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.120
B I sunburn really easily.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.280
It's like, I used to be before it all went gray.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.040
I used to have red hair.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.820
So we burn really easily.

09:20.820 --> 09:27.320
So yeah, but, but we, we will do a hot tub stream if I can convince my ghosts.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.800
After I lost like some of the first bit of my weight, I bought myself a really cute bathing

09:31.800 --> 09:34.280
suit that has like a cat face on it.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.120
And then now it's too big for me.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.840
Plus there will be adventures in hair dye in the next couple of months that involves

09:40.840 --> 09:41.840
the color blue.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840
Fun.

09:42.840 --> 09:51.520
Um, and so I need to actually get a swim cap to be able to go in chlorinated water.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.720
Me and a shirt, you and a swim cap.

09:53.720 --> 09:59.040
I think Loki should have the sun sunbathing, like sunscreen paint, like, or just do the

09:59.040 --> 10:00.040
Zuckerberg thing.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.040
Yes.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
All right.

10:02.040 --> 10:07.600
Anyway, so we're going to have a, we're going to, I've already volunteered everybody.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.040
We're going to have a hot tub stream in the not too distant future.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.040
We'll figure it out.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
All right.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.560
Anyway, all right, let's get into it, but we're not here to talk about hot tubs.

10:16.560 --> 10:23.480
We're here to talk about video games and wow, our industry had a lot of fascinating video

10:23.480 --> 10:24.680
game news this week.

10:24.680 --> 10:28.520
Um, I think everybody knows about the court battle that's going on right now between Epic

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
Games and Apple.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.400
We've talked about that at length on the show.

10:31.400 --> 10:37.760
The reality is we're not going to have a resolution to that whole thing for months because you

10:37.760 --> 10:40.000
know, legal stuff takes time.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.180
Even though the trial, yes, is only a few weeks.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.960
The judge will still take months and months to come up with her decision.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.300
So we don't know what's really going to happen there until later.

10:48.300 --> 10:53.960
But the fascinating part is that it's not even just really Epic and Apple, but all of

10:53.960 --> 11:00.520
these other companies are having secrets that are kind of put out there in open court.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.720
Yes, there are some things that are redacted.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.880
We haven't seen necessarily everything, but we're certainly seeing a lot more and getting

11:06.880 --> 11:12.800
a real peek into the insight of this industry, into how CEOs write their emails.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.160
We're getting insight into the types of things that are discussed, the goals that the long

11:17.160 --> 11:21.640
term goals that these companies have, who's making money, who's not making money.

11:21.640 --> 11:27.660
We're getting a lot of insight that I didn't think many of us thought we'd really get from

11:27.660 --> 11:28.880
a court battle like this.

11:28.880 --> 11:35.000
This probably also helps explain why so many times companies settle out of court.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.640
They don't want to go to this point because of all the testimony, the evidence that gets

11:39.640 --> 11:41.160
entered and all that stuff.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.640
So anyway, let's talk about some of the evidence that's been entered and some of the things

11:45.640 --> 11:47.760
we have learned as a result of that.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.480
Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.960
There's several items to talk about and Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.

11:51.960 --> 11:52.960
You had one.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Yeah.

11:53.960 --> 12:01.560
So I'll just go ahead and start off with this, that Epic had offered a $200 million deal

12:01.560 --> 12:11.380
to Sony for, and the quote is, up to four to six PlayStation ports to PC.

12:11.380 --> 12:18.120
They were wanting to target several different video game producers, you know, big triple

12:18.120 --> 12:26.020
A names to try to bring their games over through their store and it's actually stated in their

12:26.020 --> 12:32.100
document that Nintendo was pretty much, quote, a non-starter, end quote.

12:32.100 --> 12:39.100
But their discussions with Microsoft were pretty much complicated because it was competitor

12:39.100 --> 12:48.700
for content, you know, for the, their PC game pass thing was against Epic strategy.

12:48.700 --> 12:54.500
So and on top of that, Sony had already stated that it was looking to bring a whole bunch

12:54.500 --> 12:57.040
of games to PC.

12:57.040 --> 13:04.380
So they, I mean, their first, their first PC port for Horizon Zero Dawn was on Steam.

13:04.380 --> 13:08.400
That's what I was thinking is that we've, we've seen all these PC releases from Sony.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.460
So it's interesting to think that Epic was really making a play for those.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.460
Yeah.

13:12.460 --> 13:16.540
Well, and that in days gone is also coming to Steam.

13:16.540 --> 13:22.660
So it's really looking like Steam is going to be their primary platform.

13:22.660 --> 13:28.600
And from what I understand, it actually is easier to manage their own DLC through Steam.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.660
So that would, that would make sense.

13:31.660 --> 13:36.900
And even, even Microsoft, even though there's that competitive space with game pass, and

13:36.900 --> 13:41.740
I would think also the Windows store is also inherently competition, but yet we've seen

13:41.740 --> 13:44.820
Microsoft actually kind of making moves with Steam as well.

13:44.820 --> 13:49.140
They've kind of relented on the fact that Steam has such a hold on the PC marketplace

13:49.140 --> 13:53.780
that it actually benefits Microsoft to put things like, I'm trying to think what the

13:53.780 --> 13:56.140
most recent thing was that they put on there.

13:56.140 --> 13:58.340
Maybe Halo Master Chief Collection or things like that.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.500
They've actually been putting on Steam.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.500
Which is fascinating.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
Sorry.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
But I thought that was interesting.

14:03.500 --> 14:09.180
Well, on top of that too, there's another document released during everything that Epic

14:09.180 --> 14:16.740
spent something like $12 million to secure games for its free giveaways.

14:16.740 --> 14:19.100
Yeah.

14:19.100 --> 14:28.220
And it's just, I have this feeling that they're trying to keep some sort of tight reign on

14:28.220 --> 14:34.420
the, on the content that they're able to bring in.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.420
Does that make sense?

14:35.420 --> 14:36.420
Oh yeah.

14:36.420 --> 14:37.420
Oh yeah.

14:37.420 --> 14:40.180
And again, tighter though than some of the other services.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.820
Our chat room is lighting up with comments relating to some of this.

14:44.820 --> 14:48.860
Phoenix 7726 wants to point out that Horizon did go on good old games as well.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.340
So it wasn't like exclusive to Steam.

14:50.340 --> 14:53.700
I thought at first it was only on Steam though, but I could be wrong.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.940
You may be right that it was, I thought, but I thought maybe after a little bit of time,

14:57.940 --> 14:58.940
it went to both.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.660
But anyway, I could be wrong.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.180
And it doesn't necessarily matter.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.180
It's not on Epic.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.180
True.

15:04.180 --> 15:07.180
That's the point is it went somewhere other than Epic.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.180
True.

15:08.180 --> 15:09.180
Fair enough.

15:09.180 --> 15:13.460
Quest Buster in chat says, I'm not sure that in every indie was happy to see what they

15:13.460 --> 15:16.140
were being paid by Epic to be on their store.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.140
Oh yeah.

15:17.140 --> 15:18.140
Yeah.

15:18.140 --> 15:19.140
I found that fascinating too.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.140
So it's out there.

15:20.140 --> 15:25.660
Oh, I'll take half the price, half the price of the lowest tier one that they have except

15:25.660 --> 15:26.660
for the zero one.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.220
I'm not taking zero, but I'll put pixel poops.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.220
Number two on there.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.100
I'll take a quarter of that.

15:32.100 --> 15:36.660
You know, he's paid me $12,000 and you can have, you could give that game away for free.

15:36.660 --> 15:37.660
I'm cool.

15:37.660 --> 15:41.020
You out there, you out there, Tim Sweeney, you part of the oil army listening to this

15:41.020 --> 15:42.020
shit.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.660
Probably even sweeten the deal even more and undercut me even more on that.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.340
Still say yes.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.340
I love that.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.260
Tweet at him, get his attention.

15:52.260 --> 15:56.340
But yeah, it's, but the comment is still true.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.340
What our listener said.

15:57.340 --> 16:01.300
It's probably really alarming for some of the indies to see like those that made more,

16:01.300 --> 16:06.120
those that didn't make much because some of those games, like I think the Batman trilogy,

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
like I could be wrong.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.080
I don't have the chart in front of me, but I remember that one was like a million bucks

16:10.080 --> 16:11.080
or something.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.140
A lot of money.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.140
And Arkham was like 15.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.140
It was a 1.5 million.

16:15.140 --> 16:19.340
That was a lot of money, you know, especially for a game that wasn't particularly new as

16:19.340 --> 16:20.340
a few years old.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.960
And most of the games they give away are old, but not all of them are.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.240
Some of them are new.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.120
And so they paid a lot less for that.

16:27.120 --> 16:32.680
Now, granted, it takes a much larger team to build a Batman Arkham Asylum than it does

16:32.680 --> 16:37.520
to build, you know, some of the indie titles, but still to kind of see that in the numbers

16:37.520 --> 16:41.400
and really see the differences in the numbers was really shocking.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.360
I definitely like if you haven't seen that document, look it up.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.560
Obviously, it would be very boring for me to sit here and read the Excel spreadsheet

16:47.560 --> 16:48.680
aloud you.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.000
You all follow the industry.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.400
I'm sure you're going to Google it and look that up if you haven't already, because it

16:53.400 --> 16:54.960
was all over Twitter and social media.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.760
But I thought that was fascinating.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.280
And this is this is that's exactly the type of document I didn't think we were going to

17:00.280 --> 17:04.760
get out of this trial and that probably everybody would have liked to avoid.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.720
It was interesting.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.320
So anyway, that dark soccer.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.320
Thank you for that.

17:10.320 --> 17:15.080
Loki, you've been following some of the secret secrets unlocked as well, right?

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
Yeah.

17:16.080 --> 17:22.320
So, you know, apparently during the court case, Apple is trying to get Epic to admit

17:22.320 --> 17:26.760
that there's like some questionable content on their storefront only because they have

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
the itch.io app.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.640
And we know what kind of junk's on there.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.640
My game.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.640
So and porn.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
There's porn on there, too.

17:33.640 --> 17:40.000
But, you know, because I guess since that's accessible on their storefront, they're kind

17:40.000 --> 17:42.560
of trying to say that it's it's part of it.

17:42.560 --> 17:48.940
But they're, I don't know, very clever play when you consider that itch.io was just added

17:48.940 --> 17:52.000
to Epic like a week before the trial started.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.480
And they even kind of got called out on that is that, well, you just put itch.io on the

17:55.480 --> 17:58.040
store conveniently before trial.

17:58.040 --> 18:02.920
And then that turned into this whole so Epic is fine with porn being on its marketplace.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.080
It's a very interesting tactic, very, very interesting.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.240
Anyway, I was fascinated by that, but go ahead.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.560
And then also, I thought it was interesting that they've made nine billion dollars on

18:12.560 --> 18:15.680
Fortnite between twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen.

18:15.680 --> 18:22.000
So that's that's only I mean, that's ridiculous, just nine billion dollars in like a couple

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
of years.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.200
And I'm assuming that's just grown since then.

18:25.200 --> 18:32.440
So I guess that's why they want to get it on the Apple store to make even more billions.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.440
They got to start getting in the positive dollars fast, right?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.440
Yeah, pretty much.

18:39.440 --> 18:44.440
Were you surprised to hear that the epic store is losing money?

18:44.440 --> 18:52.440
Yeah, but I mean, it's just it's not that old and, you know, it takes a while for businesses

18:52.440 --> 19:00.680
to turn a profit, and especially if they're even giving away the free stuff, if that necessarily

19:00.680 --> 19:05.600
brings people to the epic store to maybe try Fortnite or something like that, I'm sure

19:05.600 --> 19:09.400
they more than make up for it with the profits that they're making from that.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.120
So it's it's more of like a loss leader, I guess.

19:12.120 --> 19:17.120
Yeah, it's it's the digital version of what Black Friday is all about to retailers.

19:17.120 --> 19:21.560
You sell that cheap ass two hundred dollar TV or whatever it is to get people in the

19:21.560 --> 19:26.360
door to then look at the other things that are in there that maybe aren't as good on

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
a sale.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.800
This is this is something that Fry's Electronics was notorious for.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.800
Rest in peace, right?

19:31.800 --> 19:35.000
If you've ever been to a Fry's Electronics and I'm sure there's other stores like this,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
but Fry's especially.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.960
So you walk into Fry's, you buy something like one of these loss leaders, even though

19:39.960 --> 19:42.760
there's maybe five or ten of them available on Black Friday.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.760
But then what happens?

19:43.760 --> 19:46.820
You go to stand in line and wait for a checkout.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.880
How long is that little tunnel?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.600
Not not literally a tunnel, but you are surrounded on the left and right.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
How long is that little tunnel to wait to check out?

19:54.600 --> 19:59.200
It is literally like a queue to a line at Disneyland.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.960
It is extremely long and wrapping around Black Friday.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.520
You have to find the end of the line with a dude that has a giant like a bouquet of

20:07.520 --> 20:12.800
balloons, you know, saying the line ends here and it just winds through the entire store.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.960
I mean, you're literally forced through an aisle.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.760
That is shit you don't need, but you want it anyway.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.400
It's like I don't need this cotton candy machine.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.480
I don't need this hot dog warmer that they have for convenience stores, but they have

20:27.480 --> 20:31.920
it in the store and I'm kind of considering it walking past it.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.080
But you know, I don't really need that.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.840
Oh, hey, look at all of these cool USB things.

20:36.840 --> 20:43.200
I could use some more USB cables and ooh, and some balls, you know, you know, some of

20:43.200 --> 20:44.200
that.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.080
I mean, there's lots of stuff anyway.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
That's it.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
And I love Fry's.

20:50.080 --> 20:55.280
Honestly, none of us really complained about what they were doing, but it is very obvious

20:55.280 --> 20:56.280
what they are.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.240
Maybe if I had kids, I'd complain because there's a lot of fucking candy in that aisle.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
But anyway, I digress.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.360
It was fine with kids.

21:02.360 --> 21:07.000
It was it was a great store just to walk around and check out all the weird stuff and especially

21:07.000 --> 21:11.120
like, you know, going in there, they had all these like bargain bins just like when you

21:11.120 --> 21:12.120
walked in.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.120
It was just all over the place.

21:13.120 --> 21:17.820
All these things that they were like as seen on TV or just it's like, ooh, ooh, I'll look

21:17.820 --> 21:19.580
at all this like canned air.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.220
Ooh, look at all these batteries.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.420
I could buy like a 50 pack of batteries.

21:23.420 --> 21:24.420
It's so cheap.

21:24.420 --> 21:27.140
It's like that's that's exactly that's exactly it.

21:27.140 --> 21:31.380
So what we're looking at with Epic Games and that's what it's it's the digital version

21:31.380 --> 21:32.380
of that.

21:32.380 --> 21:36.820
You put a loss leader like a free game to get that thing installed on somebody's computer,

21:36.820 --> 21:41.140
the Epic Games launcher, and then, oh, look at all these game sales that are going on

21:41.140 --> 21:42.140
or exclusives.

21:42.140 --> 21:46.020
Y'all want some Borderlands three, OK, you know, all this stuff in the store.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.500
And to obviously, to some extent, it has worked.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
Yeah.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
Some interesting comments in chat.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.500
D.J.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.380
Rama S. says, you see what they did with Discord.

21:54.380 --> 21:59.380
Oh, I always said that was this still blows my mind to this day how this didn't work,

21:59.380 --> 22:03.180
that Discord put this free chat app on everybody's computer.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.100
They were like basically like, oh, slack.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.220
Oh, we're going to make a free version of that.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.780
Oh, team, team, team speak.

22:08.780 --> 22:09.780
What the hell was it?

22:09.780 --> 22:10.780
Ventrilo.

22:10.780 --> 22:11.900
We're going to make a free version of that.

22:12.900 --> 22:18.540
And you put this thing on the computers free and then they put a game store in it.

22:18.540 --> 22:21.740
And I thought that was the smartest thing I think I'd ever seen a company do.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.700
Yet it flopped and they no longer sell games.

22:24.700 --> 22:25.700
Unbelievable.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.780
It's unbelievable to me.

22:26.780 --> 22:31.580
But I think I don't think they swung hard enough with that.

22:31.580 --> 22:35.020
And I know that's weird to say because I think if they'd swung harder, it might have annoyed

22:35.020 --> 22:36.540
some of us.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.540
But I think that's where they maybe made the mistake.

22:38.540 --> 22:41.500
But anyway, I think that's very interesting.

22:41.500 --> 22:45.300
Let's see, Questbuster says it's all about getting the bodies or Epic's case, the fresh

22:45.300 --> 22:48.740
user accounts into their store and so on and so on.

22:48.740 --> 22:52.940
So anyway, Loki, a few more tidbits that came out of the courtroom.

22:52.940 --> 22:58.460
Yeah, so let's see what else we have here.

22:58.460 --> 23:04.260
Well, we talked about the exclusives and how much money they had there for that.

23:04.260 --> 23:09.460
So it was like one billion dollars, which is ridiculous.

23:09.460 --> 23:12.380
And I don't know, that's all it pretty much had.

23:12.380 --> 23:16.940
There's there's a lot of drama going on that I'm not really paying attention to right now.

23:16.940 --> 23:19.300
Honestly, I don't really care how it ends up.

23:19.300 --> 23:27.300
I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but like it's not really beneficial to me.

23:27.300 --> 23:33.580
Whatever it does, whatever your YouTubers, your Twitter followers, your podcasts, whatever

23:33.580 --> 23:36.700
they're saying about this case, it doesn't matter at the end of the day.

23:36.700 --> 23:37.700
Like I hate this.

23:37.700 --> 23:38.700
This is the reality.

23:38.940 --> 23:39.940
It doesn't matter.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.660
It's going to be up to this judge.

23:41.660 --> 23:45.340
And whatever happens will be a very interesting thing.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.660
But we'll find out in a few months what happens with that.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.660
So there you go.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.660
All right.

23:49.660 --> 23:53.220
Before we get to our gaming weeks, let me get to another couple of comments here.

23:53.220 --> 23:59.100
Phoenix 7726 says, I kind of wonder how disco makes money at this point, Discord, not Star

23:59.100 --> 24:01.220
Trek Discovery in this case, I think.

24:01.220 --> 24:03.180
Those Nitro subs can't be that much.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.860
They don't advertise and servers cost money to maintain.

24:06.860 --> 24:10.540
I think they're making more Nitro subs than you might give them credit for.

24:10.540 --> 24:13.820
I actually have the Nitro sub because I wanted to boost.

24:13.820 --> 24:18.700
It only takes one person's boost to boost the server a little bit to get better voice

24:18.700 --> 24:19.700
quality.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.740
And I feel like I use it so much.

24:21.740 --> 24:26.540
Maybe I ought to kick them a little bit of money, but I think it did come out not that

24:26.540 --> 24:27.540
long ago.

24:27.540 --> 24:32.140
That is where Discord's making a chunk of its money, but you're not wrong in thinking

24:32.140 --> 24:34.660
they're probably not making enough money.

24:35.380 --> 24:39.100
And we have a pair of stories coming up later that might give some insight into how are

24:39.100 --> 24:41.820
they going to make more money later on.

24:41.820 --> 24:43.540
We'll get into that a little later.

24:43.540 --> 24:48.980
So DJ Rama S in chat says, plus investments from venture capitalists.

24:48.980 --> 24:52.000
Yes, investments in the future is a big one.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.260
And again, we have more coming up on that later.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.260
So we'll get to that later.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.580
But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

24:58.580 --> 25:01.400
been playing this week and our impressions thereof.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.900
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

25:02.900 --> 25:04.300
What have you been playing?

25:04.340 --> 25:07.540
I played a few more things than just Animal Crossing.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.180
I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight and I've been streaming.

25:10.180 --> 25:17.500
I actually had a fun, if me, terrible gameplay moment of going into Puddin's channel and

25:17.500 --> 25:23.380
doing a custom game where it was a race to see if we could pop the hatch, close the hatch,

25:23.380 --> 25:30.340
which starts the end game countdown, see if I could hook them before the timer went out,

25:30.340 --> 25:31.460
which, of course, I failed.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.180
I'm not very good.

25:33.180 --> 25:34.180
That was pretty fun, though.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.420
I think I'm going to do stuff like that in the future.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.660
That's fun.

25:37.860 --> 25:43.860
And then I also started Fantasia after last night's episode.

25:44.060 --> 25:46.660
And I really like that game.

25:46.860 --> 25:50.860
It really just smacks of old school SNES Final Fantasy stuff.

25:51.060 --> 25:53.500
And it's the music is great.

25:53.700 --> 26:00.860
I love that the backgrounds and objects are hand-built diorama pieces.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.340
And you can really even on the rendered

26:03.540 --> 26:09.060
stuff, you can see the texture built into those those other items.

26:09.260 --> 26:13.660
And I love I love the story so far, too,

26:13.860 --> 26:17.940
although I did think that the main character was a robot at first.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.580
And I had a very sad moment right at the beginning, but I'm not going to spoil.

26:21.780 --> 26:25.820
It's a fairly new game, but I'll be playing it on Tuesdays.

26:25.820 --> 26:27.940
I'll have some information posted somewhere.

26:28.140 --> 26:30.740
I forgot what my schedule is already.

26:31.940 --> 26:35.220
But well, after OLR tonight is one of them.

26:35.420 --> 26:41.180
Well, yeah, but after OLR tonight, I am debuting a

26:41.380 --> 26:46.260
I mean, it's still me sucking it dead by daylight, but it has a fancy title now.

26:46.460 --> 26:52.020
It's Monday Midnight Massacre, OK, because on the East Coast it'll be

26:52.220 --> 26:55.060
Monday by the time we're pretty much done, OK?

26:55.260 --> 26:56.980
I've even made music for it.

26:57.140 --> 27:01.020
And some kind soul uploaded every sound

27:01.020 --> 27:03.700
effect from one of the earlier builds of Dead by Daylight.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.740
So I was able to incorporate some of it in my music.

27:05.940 --> 27:09.300
But I wrote I did everything else myself.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.340
I did the melody.

27:10.540 --> 27:12.300
I did the

27:12.500 --> 27:15.420
and it's an homage since I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.380
It's an homage to the theme of the game.

27:17.580 --> 27:18.780
Quite the musician lately.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.340
Been doing great. I'm trying.

27:20.540 --> 27:24.780
I mean, I've I've really enjoyed I mean,

27:24.940 --> 27:27.660
I think that my streaming has pretty much

27:27.860 --> 27:35.220
motivated me to get a lot better in Logic Pro, which is what I use to make my music.

27:35.420 --> 27:41.140
And for those on stream who are watching watching with us live,

27:41.340 --> 27:48.140
I have myself a nice new MIDI keyboard and it's an Akai Mini,

27:48.340 --> 27:51.820
the MPK Mini, if anyone wants to know.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.220
But I've had just a really, a really great time.

27:54.260 --> 27:57.780
I feel like I've found some inspiration.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.420
Love it.

27:59.900 --> 28:03.460
Looking in chat over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network,

28:03.660 --> 28:08.220
Phoenix 7726 is asking, have any of the hosts played the new Resident Evil?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.100
I'm assuming Loki hasn't.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.260
So I think it's a no from all of us.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.940
But I did I know it's not the same as playing it.

28:14.940 --> 28:18.020
But I did watch some Twitch streams of it for quite a bit of time.

28:18.020 --> 28:20.820
Like I actually watched like at least an hour, if not a little more.

28:21.020 --> 28:23.660
And I even watched a YouTube as well to kind of get a sense of it.

28:23.900 --> 28:29.500
I'm I think it might be a little too intense for me just on the scare front

28:29.500 --> 28:32.060
and all that stuff, like I just kind of know what I can handle and what might be

28:32.060 --> 28:35.820
a bit much and some of those scenes I watched, although I think the characters

28:36.020 --> 28:39.580
are really well done and, you know, knowing that, you know,

28:39.780 --> 28:43.180
tying it back to Dead by Daylight, we know that Resident Evil is going to be

28:43.180 --> 28:46.420
the next chapter and that there is going to be a new killer from the Resident Evil

28:46.620 --> 28:50.940
series, I really don't mind if it's a killer from Resident Evil eight.

28:51.140 --> 28:53.620
I know there are people out there that really want to have Wesker

28:53.820 --> 28:55.940
or Mr. X or something.

28:56.140 --> 29:00.900
There's a big rumor out there that it is the the witch trio from Resident Evil eight

29:00.900 --> 29:02.820
is the killer because there's some hints in the video.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.100
And the five for the fifth anniversary

29:05.300 --> 29:08.500
looks like one of the hand size that the witch daughters use.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.300
And I would be totally OK with that.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.420
I think that would be a really cool killer.

29:12.620 --> 29:17.020
I think Lady Dimitrescu we got I still wish we had a Code Veronica theme.

29:17.220 --> 29:20.980
I as much as I know some people would just hate it.

29:20.980 --> 29:23.140
I would love Lady Dimitrescu as a killer.

29:23.220 --> 29:27.140
I just think like the idea of like a vampire, because we don't have a vampire

29:27.340 --> 29:29.940
in Dead by Daylight yet, so it seems very, very fit.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.900
So, I mean, we'll see. We'll see.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.660
And obviously she is an iconic character, but we'll see.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.140
Obviously, Resident Evil also has other icons.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.300
You know, when it when you get to survivor, it gets a lot harder to choose.

29:40.500 --> 29:45.620
And I wonder if it won't do the Stranger Things thing and actually give us

29:45.820 --> 29:50.260
two survivors. I wonder if we won't have Chris and Jill or something.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.180
But well, it's a matter of time.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.940
We find out in a couple of weeks, right?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.260
I think there are fifth anniversary streams in a couple of weeks.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.220
So, yeah. All right.

29:59.420 --> 30:03.100
Phoenix 7726 says, I bet a shitload of people want Lady D.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.780
And then DJ Rama S says, just to be stepped on.

30:05.980 --> 30:09.420
Yes, I think there are quite a few people that like to see it.

30:09.620 --> 30:12.500
Whatever the reason is, I just I you know what?

30:12.700 --> 30:14.980
If we're going to meme, let's fucking meme.

30:15.140 --> 30:20.580
OK, like put her in dead by daylight and then let the user content flow, but we'll

30:20.580 --> 30:22.780
see what happens, we'll see. All right.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.300
Moving on with our gaming weeks, Loki.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.660
All right, so this week it's it's been all

30:28.860 --> 30:32.900
Minecraft for the most part, been still playing on the server stuff,

30:33.100 --> 30:36.660
building more farms, staying up late, doing that kind of thing,

30:36.860 --> 30:40.860
and then preparing to build my shop in the shopping district.

30:41.060 --> 30:45.980
So lots of preparation, like on my creative

30:46.180 --> 30:49.060
world, that's kind of a copy of the seed that they have.

30:49.260 --> 30:55.020
So I've been designing it there so I can build it in the actual game.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.340
So once that's done, I think that'll be kind of I don't know if that's going to be

30:58.340 --> 30:59.980
part of episode two or episode three.

30:59.980 --> 31:01.660
I haven't decided yet to go through all

31:01.660 --> 31:03.740
the footage I have right now and see what I've got.

31:03.740 --> 31:07.340
If it's enough content to do that, I would like to have that as a kind

31:07.340 --> 31:10.540
of build montage in there, but maybe for another episode or something.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.060
So we'll see.

31:12.260 --> 31:15.020
But yeah, I just have to work more on the video editing stuff.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.620
I know it's like.

31:16.820 --> 31:19.740
I've got a nagging feeling, you know, it's

31:19.940 --> 31:23.860
not outside of my mind any time I'm playing like I got to edit this video.

31:24.060 --> 31:26.260
So hopefully that'll be coming soon.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.100
I'm hoping sometime maybe next week.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.340
And then aside from that, Orna just been playing more of that,

31:31.540 --> 31:35.180
you know, taking over territories when I go places, that kind of thing.

31:35.380 --> 31:36.700
Nice.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.900
My gaming week, I also have been back in Orna a little bit.

31:40.340 --> 31:42.020
I caught some areas out in the wilderness

31:42.220 --> 31:44.900
that nobody had on my way up to Matt's place.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.540
So that was fun.

31:47.020 --> 31:49.500
And continuing with the GPS games, playing Pokemon Go.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.620
I'm still not done with Meryl day.

31:51.820 --> 31:54.580
And I've already up to five shinies, which is pretty good.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.140
And a couple of good ones, too.

31:56.140 --> 31:59.260
So I wish Meryl was a little bit of a better Pokemon in the meta game.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.780
But maybe you guys know something. I don't.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.740
Maybe Meryl's OK in the great league or something.

32:02.940 --> 32:03.980
I don't know.

32:04.180 --> 32:07.100
So I've been working on that a little bit.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.820
Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight.

32:08.820 --> 32:09.620
That's kind of my new.

32:10.540 --> 32:11.940
This is the first week where I can say

32:12.140 --> 32:15.660
I haven't played Final Fantasy 14 because all my friends left.

32:15.860 --> 32:18.660
Shane's super into Monster Hunter with Dom.

32:18.660 --> 32:21.100
Dominic, who we also play Final Fantasy 14 with.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.180
I think Ray, who we also play that game with, went on a trip.

32:24.380 --> 32:25.900
However,

32:26.100 --> 32:29.780
the Final Fantasy 14 gang will reunite on Friday

32:29.980 --> 32:33.700
because Fan Fest is, Virtual Fan Fest is Friday.

32:33.900 --> 32:37.860
And yes, we already know about the expansion, but we're going to get the rest

32:37.900 --> 32:40.020
of the details on the expansion on Friday.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.860
What is the other class that is going to be in the game?

32:42.860 --> 32:44.100
What are some of the other features?

32:44.300 --> 32:48.140
So basically we get all the details of the expansion will be out on Friday.

32:48.340 --> 32:52.620
If they allow us to co-stream, we may do another thing on VOG.

32:52.820 --> 32:53.940
So you'll have to stay tuned to Twitter.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.780
We don't know if it's allowable or not.

32:55.780 --> 32:56.940
They kind of announced it at the last

32:56.940 --> 32:58.940
minute last time and they'll probably do it this time.

32:59.140 --> 33:03.380
But if it is allowed to co-stream, we will probably do that at VOG on Friday night.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.660
So keep an eye out for it.

33:05.860 --> 33:08.580
To which Bobby Blackwell says Final Fantasy 14 dead game.

33:08.780 --> 33:12.180
No, it's just one of those, you know, we've kind of burned out this content.

33:12.380 --> 33:13.700
We're ready for new stuff.

33:13.900 --> 33:16.820
Everybody will be back once the new patch is out.

33:17.020 --> 33:22.300
And Phoenix7726 says, I've heard that Final Fantasy 14 is doing better than WoW these days.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.180
I really get the sense that is the case, too.

33:25.180 --> 33:26.900
And I don't I don't want to pit the games

33:26.900 --> 33:30.740
against each other because both have very strong, very loyal fan bases.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.780
But I think this is just one of those things where

33:33.900 --> 33:38.420
WoW has been getting outplayed a little bit because they've been very

33:38.620 --> 33:42.020
comfortable being the leading MMO for a long time.

33:42.220 --> 33:46.100
I don't think they're used to another company pushing out the content as

33:46.300 --> 33:49.460
regular and that's one thing that 14 has done very well.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.340
They're pushing out content regularly.

33:52.540 --> 33:55.980
And that's something Blizzard's kind of slipped on and I think it's noticeable.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.580
However, of course, we have WoW Classic.

33:58.580 --> 33:59.380
There's a lot going on.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.460
We'll talk about that later in the show and stuff.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.420
And I don't mean to totally like I'm not trying to like shit on WoW or anything.

34:04.420 --> 34:05.300
That's not what I'm trying to do.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.100
They're both good games in their own regards.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.100
But I just think that Blizzard, you know,

34:09.300 --> 34:13.060
is getting challenged a little bit on the make more content front.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.020
So anyhow,

34:15.220 --> 34:17.460
the reason why I was saying all this, I haven't been playing 14.

34:17.460 --> 34:20.140
I've been playing a little more Dead by Daylight to fill in the time.

34:20.340 --> 34:24.340
Believe it or not, I'm playing I'm enjoying playing Survivor a lot more than I used to.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.500
So I do go back and forth between Survivor and Killer.

34:27.700 --> 34:31.340
I got my favorite Survivor and Jamie's least favorite.

34:31.420 --> 34:32.420
No, I don't think it's your least favorite.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.700
But you love to make fun of Dwight.

34:34.900 --> 34:35.820
I love Dwight.

34:36.020 --> 34:38.860
No, Dwight's just, Dwight's kind of generic.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.020
The character I hate is Bill.

34:41.220 --> 34:42.580
Oh, I don't care for Bill either.

34:42.780 --> 34:47.140
You know, I think as much as everybody loves Ash from Evil Dead,

34:47.140 --> 34:48.620
I think he's extraordinary.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.460
Ash is terrible.

34:49.660 --> 34:51.900
I think he's extraordinarily out of place in Dead by Daylight.

34:51.900 --> 34:52.660
I got to be honest.

34:52.860 --> 34:56.020
I was just watching people play him in his

34:56.220 --> 35:00.980
perks and he is really difficult to be a good survivor on, especially as a starter.

35:00.980 --> 35:04.020
Yeah, I mean, he's novel is what he is.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.660
He's novel.

35:05.860 --> 35:10.860
If there were any deadites in the game, then, yeah, I'd have more of a reason to be there.

35:11.060 --> 35:14.380
But I think I'm working on the base survivors just to get their perks.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.460
I'll probably I'm almost I'm level thirty nine on Dwight.

35:17.460 --> 35:21.500
So I get his last perk in one more level and then I'll probably move on to a Meg.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.500
I'll probably just go right across top row, go to Meg, then go to Claudette,

35:24.700 --> 35:27.460
then maybe go to Jake. I don't know if Jake has anything I really want, though.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.300
I may go to Fengmen at that point.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.820
If I do it, I'm actually going to start with Claudette.

35:32.020 --> 35:35.300
I started I started with Claudette, too, so I could get self-care.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.020
But then I realized that self-care is

35:37.020 --> 35:40.180
kind of overrated because you're going to be flowing in medical kits.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.420
So if you want to heal yourself, just bring a med kit.

35:42.620 --> 35:46.180
Either that or I'm going to do the Meglet.

35:46.380 --> 35:48.220
Yeah, Meg's Meg's makes a lot of fun, too.

35:48.420 --> 35:52.260
So anyway, I've been doing that and playing survivor and killer.

35:52.460 --> 35:57.260
I will say, too, I cameoed on Alan's stream on Wednesday.

35:57.260 --> 36:00.460
So he does his Taylor Swift with friends.

36:00.460 --> 36:03.500
That's what they call surviving with friends, SWF Swift.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.940
So he did his Taylor Swift with friends

36:06.140 --> 36:09.620
on Wednesday and I played for like two hours with him.

36:09.820 --> 36:12.300
And I wasn't a total flop.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.820
Like there was a couple of matches where he died and I didn't.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.020
And that felt really good.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.300
So it was good.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.700
So, yeah, I've been playing lots of Dead by Daylight.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.500
OK, have I been playing anything new, though?

36:22.700 --> 36:24.140
Yes, I have something.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.340
It's new to me, though.

36:25.340 --> 36:31.140
It's not a new game, but it is new on Xbox because it just came out this week

36:31.340 --> 36:35.140
on Xbox and it came out on Xbox Game Pass as a result of that.

36:35.340 --> 36:39.820
So I have been spending quite a bit of time with Dragon Quest Builders, too.

36:40.020 --> 36:42.140
So it's funny that Loki brought off mine,

36:42.340 --> 36:44.740
brought up Minecraft because there's a lot of parallels, obviously.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.660
Like, you know, there's a lot of the Minecraft

36:46.660 --> 36:48.460
formula that you have in Dragon Quest Builders.

36:48.660 --> 36:52.460
And I played quite a bit of the first game and I liked it a bit.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.380
I didn't love it,

36:54.580 --> 36:58.260
but I'm really enjoying my experience with Dragon Quest Builders, too.

36:58.460 --> 37:01.340
The nice thing is, like most Dragon Quest games,

37:01.340 --> 37:03.300
doesn't matter if you never played the first one.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.420
Dragon Quest Builders, too, will help you out with the system and all that stuff.

37:07.620 --> 37:09.740
And, you know, it starts you from scratch

37:09.740 --> 37:11.780
and the stories don't really relate or anything.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.940
So I think they may I think they actually might.

37:15.140 --> 37:18.860
But it's OK if you don't know, like I'm not I'm not lost or anything in the story.

37:19.020 --> 37:22.620
I think generally you're just kind of in that bad, good guy,

37:22.820 --> 37:25.740
defeated bad guy a long time ago there, you're all caught up.

37:25.940 --> 37:29.180
Like it's like that's that's all you need to know the first game.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.700
And I'm I'm liking the fact that these

37:31.900 --> 37:34.780
worlds you go to are really big and there's a lot to do.

37:34.980 --> 37:39.340
And there's a lot more like creative share stuff in there.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.140
I'm surprised some of the stuff that gets

37:41.340 --> 37:43.460
on Square Enix's online platform in that game.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.780
But all right. But yeah, I'm enjoying the game.

37:45.820 --> 37:49.340
It's a very nice just kind of plop down and play for

37:49.540 --> 37:51.820
almost hours because you start to lose sense of time.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.860
And I'm I'm still in the first

37:54.060 --> 37:58.500
not the not the shore you wash up on, but the first world after that, the farming

37:58.500 --> 38:01.580
world, I'm still in that farming world and I've sunk quite a bit of time into the game.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.740
So, yeah, it's

38:04.940 --> 38:06.300
it's it's been enjoyable.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.580
I like Dragon Quest Builders, too.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.900
You know, ask me again. Ask me if I finish it.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.780
Do I like it enough to finish it? We'll see.

38:12.980 --> 38:13.860
I'll check that out.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.540
Anyway, I know a lot of people were recommending that to me in Discord,

38:16.540 --> 38:19.540
so good call on that because you're right, I enjoy the game.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.180
So Dragon Quest Builders 2.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.020
All right.

38:23.220 --> 38:24.740
That's it for our gaming weeks.

38:24.940 --> 38:27.900
So I think we will get into some other news.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.420
So let's start with Loki.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.980
Yeah, so this was a pleasant surprise.

38:33.180 --> 38:38.060
We got a trailer from Nintendo for a brand new game called Game Builder Garage.

38:38.260 --> 38:41.500
And what Game Builder Garage appears to be

38:41.500 --> 38:45.300
is a lot of folks may not remember Labo.

38:45.500 --> 38:50.100
So Labo, you have the games that were kind of included with it.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.140
Hold on. Quarantine hasn't been that long.

38:52.340 --> 38:53.980
Like Labo was like a toy.

38:54.180 --> 38:59.900
OK, so what I mean by Labo is you may not know in Labo you can create your own things.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.340
OK, so there is actually like programming

39:03.540 --> 39:06.780
and stuff you can do within Labo that's kind of similar to this.

39:06.980 --> 39:11.300
It's block based and you kind of, you know, drag stuff together to

39:11.820 --> 39:13.100
basically create code.

39:13.300 --> 39:19.620
And one key hit that this is based on that is I believe, if I remember correctly,

39:19.820 --> 39:25.380
that robot that's in the trailer is actually in Labo, if I remember correctly.

39:25.580 --> 39:29.220
But yeah, so basically it's kind of what they're doing is they're taking like

39:29.420 --> 39:36.780
the programming that they had with Labo and basically bringing it to a broader

39:36.780 --> 39:41.500
market to allow people to code and make their own games within it.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.220
So that's pretty awesome that they do

39:43.420 --> 39:46.820
that and they kind of walk you through on how to do stuff.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.820
I think it's a great thing to get more

39:49.020 --> 39:51.260
people into coding, even like the block based stuff.

39:51.460 --> 39:53.660
I mean, Scratch, that's how a lot of people get started.

39:53.860 --> 39:55.500
So it looks pretty cool.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.900
It's supposed to be coming out, I think,

39:57.100 --> 40:01.500
looks like in June, June 11th for 30 bucks.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.580
What a pleasant surprise from Nintendo.

40:03.580 --> 40:04.460
Very interesting.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.940
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

40:05.980 --> 40:08.260
You know, we haven't had any leaks or anything.

40:08.460 --> 40:13.060
And also they're doing you know, this is again and this is not the first time

40:13.260 --> 40:15.700
because they did this not that long ago with another game.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.900
And I can't remember what it was in the moment, but somebody in shadow, correct me.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.620
They're really only giving a five or six week lead time on this.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.900
You know, it's kind of like, hey, you're thinking, was it Paper Mario?

40:25.100 --> 40:27.420
Paper Mario? Yes, yes, very much with that.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.420
And the other cool thing about this, too,

40:29.620 --> 40:32.780
is because you were designing your own graphics and stuff like that,

40:32.980 --> 40:35.860
they also have USB mouse support for it as well.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.780
So you can plug it into the dock if you

40:38.980 --> 40:41.860
have that set up to actually draw and stuff in there.

40:41.860 --> 40:42.660
So that's pretty cool.

40:42.860 --> 40:46.300
It sounds like this might be a very rich kind of system.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.340
It's looking like it is because this is a successor of sorts to like Labo.

40:50.540 --> 40:54.180
Like you say, I see the Mario Maker interest in this as well.

40:54.380 --> 40:57.100
This is a very interesting path for Nintendo to be taking.

40:57.100 --> 40:58.020
But I think this is great.

40:58.220 --> 41:00.820
You know, it's their own kind of like dreams sort of thing.

41:00.820 --> 41:04.900
And they seem to yeah, they seem to be pushing it more than Sony push Dreams.

41:04.940 --> 41:08.180
I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show is that I

41:08.380 --> 41:12.380
it seems like a really crucial error that Sony did not push Dreams harder.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.620
I'm really shocked at that.

41:13.820 --> 41:14.620
They really didn't.

41:14.820 --> 41:18.860
It's such a good like piece of software, but it's just like nobody knows about it.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.100
And like you can do like so much stuff with it.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.180
It's just they didn't advertise it at all.

41:25.380 --> 41:29.540
I hope that I hope they do a mulligan and we'll try to make a PS5 version that's

41:29.740 --> 41:32.420
a little, you know, bigger, bigger, better, stronger,

41:32.420 --> 41:34.380
and that it actually gets the promotion it deserves.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.580
Because I don't I don't understand that at all.

41:36.580 --> 41:39.820
Why Sony didn't push that the way they push LittleBigPlanet.

41:40.020 --> 41:44.740
They did sort of I mean, they did cover it like it was in like several of their E3

41:44.740 --> 41:48.580
events, but it was always like some weird like artsy thing that they did with it

41:48.780 --> 41:53.220
where like they're controlling puppets or they're like playing music or something

41:53.220 --> 41:54.940
like that. It doesn't really showcase.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.180
Let me make it very plain.

41:56.180 --> 41:56.980
Let me be very plain.

41:57.180 --> 42:00.780
They didn't showcase Dreams the way Nintendo is showcasing this.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.580
No, it is it is very clear what this is all about from the way Nintendo showcased

42:04.780 --> 42:09.060
it, but Nintendo in many ways is also a master of messaging.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.460
And that's not a knock on Sony.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.660
Sony's hell.

42:11.660 --> 42:15.740
We all remember that E3 press conference when they showed those videos that just

42:15.940 --> 42:19.660
dunked on Xbox and threw them out in the dumpster like it was it was shocking.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.820
So we can't say the Sony Sony's great at messaging when they want to do it.

42:24.020 --> 42:27.060
Nintendo's, you know, really, really, really good at it.

42:27.260 --> 42:32.140
And Microsoft, you know, as much as that event was 10 years ago and a lot's changed

42:32.140 --> 42:35.860
with Microsoft and Microsoft's great at messaging in their own way as well.

42:36.060 --> 42:38.660
But my my my real point is, is that, you know,

42:38.860 --> 42:40.660
Sony should have pushed dreams more.

42:40.860 --> 42:44.180
And I think with this and Nintendo, we get the short time frame.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.220
But I think there's going to be a big audience for this.

42:46.420 --> 42:48.180
Again, it's kind of like one of those like game.

42:48.180 --> 42:50.340
I didn't know I needed until you showed it to me.

42:50.460 --> 42:52.260
Even I'm interested in it and I don't

42:52.260 --> 42:55.380
necessarily sit there and make a lot of games, but I kind of want to play other

42:55.380 --> 42:58.460
people's games, and that's the other thing that's interesting about Nintendo is

42:58.460 --> 43:00.340
that, you know, we're seeing all these comments in chat.

43:00.540 --> 43:02.540
S.H.A. 100 Matt saying, I'm waiting for

43:02.540 --> 43:04.940
someone to make a recreation of Mother 3 in this.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.820
And just as the person goes to share it, the game deletes it.

43:08.020 --> 43:11.380
DJ Rama S says, finally, O.L.R. the RPG.

43:11.580 --> 43:15.300
Bobby Blackwolf says, everyone's like, don't like your minimum wage job.

43:15.500 --> 43:16.700
Learn to code, lol.

43:16.820 --> 43:18.060
So now they can learn to code.

43:18.060 --> 43:19.580
And then they're like, we're short staff.

43:19.580 --> 43:20.620
Nobody wants to work for us.

43:20.820 --> 43:23.820
Well, that's a that's that's a whole other Oprah, as they say.

43:23.980 --> 43:25.260
But great game.

43:25.460 --> 43:28.780
They can release your game, make no money off of it and still have your job.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.700
There you go. Well, yeah, the Nintendo thing.

43:30.900 --> 43:35.820
Well, I'm I'm it seems almost certain you're not going to make money off these games.

43:36.020 --> 43:37.020
No, of course not.

43:37.220 --> 43:39.660
And I think also one thing we kind of know

43:39.660 --> 43:42.980
about it is that you're going to be able to share your creations with friends.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.380
But it doesn't sound like they have a public

43:45.380 --> 43:47.660
posting forum like Mario Maker or something.

43:47.820 --> 43:49.100
Well, we could be wrong.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.900
We don't have all the details yet.

43:51.100 --> 43:53.180
I'm hoping that they have like sort of codes.

43:53.260 --> 43:55.060
I mean, they love their codes.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.460
You know, if they have some sort of share thing.

43:57.460 --> 43:59.660
But like, it would be nice if it was like a little big planet

43:59.660 --> 44:01.740
where I could search for something and find things.

44:01.740 --> 44:02.980
But like, I doubt it.

44:02.980 --> 44:04.060
I doubt it, too.

44:04.060 --> 44:04.780
We're talking about.

44:04.780 --> 44:08.780
But again, here is where and yet again, and here's where I'll knock Nintendo.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.260
So they're a master of messaging.

44:10.260 --> 44:12.180
But yet again, they always flop online.

44:12.380 --> 44:13.940
So here comes Discord.

44:13.940 --> 44:16.940
Here comes Twitter to save their butt in that regard.

44:16.940 --> 44:19.420
Well, and maybe make the problem worse in this case.

44:19.580 --> 44:21.580
But everybody's going to share their codes on Discord.

44:21.580 --> 44:22.460
Everybody's going to share.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.300
Well, we will have to make a room on the VOG Network Discord.

44:25.300 --> 44:28.380
I'm happy to do it on the VOG Network Discord over at VOG Network dot com

44:28.380 --> 44:29.660
slash Discord. Cheap plug.

44:29.660 --> 44:31.980
But join us. I'll have to make a room.

44:31.980 --> 44:36.060
That's codes for the game center.

44:36.260 --> 44:37.180
What the hell is this called?

44:37.180 --> 44:39.140
Garage center games. God damn it.

44:39.140 --> 44:41.500
What's it called? Garage games.

44:41.500 --> 44:45.900
Yeah. Garage game build or garage or game builder garage.

44:45.900 --> 44:49.300
Sorry. Garage garage garage.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.780
God damn it. Something garage, something builder.

44:51.780 --> 44:56.620
Yeah, that it's it's just it's it's avenue for people to draw

44:57.100 --> 45:00.420
ballacies flying through the air and share that.

45:00.540 --> 45:02.140
Well, how long until we'll do that?

45:02.140 --> 45:06.020
How long until someone makes the penis game immediately and shares it?

45:06.300 --> 45:09.700
I will see you in four weeks when we talk about the penis games

45:09.820 --> 45:12.580
and Nintendo having to crack down on that for weeks.

45:12.580 --> 45:14.940
You guys, that's that's about how much time we need.

45:15.580 --> 45:17.660
That'll be about the release date. And

45:18.660 --> 45:19.660
yeah.

45:20.420 --> 45:24.380
See you in four weeks when we talk about how people abuse nice things

45:24.380 --> 45:25.740
and why we can't have them.

45:25.740 --> 45:30.300
Dark Sakura, you've been quiet, but I know you like your creative

45:30.300 --> 45:31.540
outlets on Nintendo.

45:31.540 --> 45:33.860
Hello, Animal Crossing.

45:33.860 --> 45:37.620
Any interest in this garage game builder game?

45:37.660 --> 45:39.820
Really? Yeah.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.540
With this, I don't really enjoy Mario Maker either.

45:42.540 --> 45:46.340
So I mean, I don't want to make my own game.

45:47.740 --> 45:52.500
I just want to have a game that I can be creative within its universe.

45:53.300 --> 45:55.020
Interesting. OK.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.140
Yeah, this this this isn't really my kind of thing.

45:58.300 --> 46:02.260
I like I like, you know, playing Sims

46:02.900 --> 46:06.620
because it's in there with the set rules of that universe.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.780
I don't want.

46:09.780 --> 46:13.060
I don't want my game to be work.

46:13.060 --> 46:15.660
OK, I just don't want to think like that.

46:15.660 --> 46:18.700
I want to if I'm going to if I'm going to be creative

46:18.700 --> 46:23.500
in a more abstract sense, it's going to be doing something

46:24.420 --> 46:27.620
that I want to do for me.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.260
That's why I like to make music.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.940
That's why she recreate pixel poops in there.

46:33.980 --> 46:35.620
But you should talk to Aaron about that.

46:35.620 --> 46:38.260
Bobby Bockel from Chad says she doesn't want to make a game.

46:38.260 --> 46:40.380
She wants other people to make her ideas.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.700
Well, now that's a different topic.

46:41.700 --> 46:44.180
That's completely different.

46:44.180 --> 46:48.660
And I actually get your point, Jamie, because I don't play a game to work.

46:49.500 --> 46:55.260
I I get the whole fact that like you can choose your tool to make art.

46:55.300 --> 46:58.540
You can paint with oil, you can paint with watercolor,

46:58.540 --> 47:01.700
you can paint with crayons, you know, whatever it is.

47:01.980 --> 47:06.060
And so you like to paint in an Animal Crossing universe

47:06.060 --> 47:08.420
where there are certain like boundaries and things like it,

47:08.420 --> 47:11.620
not just Animal Crossing, but this example right where there's no.

47:12.460 --> 47:17.460
Go how long I sit looking at logic before I actually get started on something.

47:19.260 --> 47:20.900
Oh, I'm sure a long time I do the same.

47:20.900 --> 47:23.060
Exactly. I don't want to do that with a video game.

47:23.500 --> 47:27.780
Like if I go into the Sims, I know what's there in front of me.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.540
And so I have the tools to work with, you know, it's like

47:31.940 --> 47:35.300
if you are going to be constructing a house,

47:35.620 --> 47:37.940
you know what tools you're going to be working with.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.140
You've got those parameters.

47:40.140 --> 47:43.780
I don't want to sit and have to rack my brain.

47:44.140 --> 47:47.260
And on top of that, I just it doesn't interest me.

47:47.260 --> 47:49.820
It really doesn't. I want to play a game.

47:50.420 --> 47:53.020
I don't want to make the game.

47:53.020 --> 47:58.180
I also like I get it because like I will I will probably buy this game,

47:58.540 --> 48:00.780
but to play other people's games,

48:00.780 --> 48:05.420
probably not to make anything of substance of my own, because I'm just not sure.

48:06.100 --> 48:07.700
Maybe maybe the creative spark will bite.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.100
You never know. Never say never.

48:09.100 --> 48:13.540
But like but yet I just talked about Dragon Quest builders, too.

48:13.940 --> 48:17.940
And I'm having fun building little houses, building little structures

48:17.940 --> 48:21.060
and doing things a little bit outside of the lines of what the game is telling me

48:21.060 --> 48:23.420
and kind of like doing my own thing in that universe.

48:23.620 --> 48:25.300
I'm having a good time with it.

48:25.300 --> 48:28.900
So I actually I actually relate to what you're saying, Jamie. I really do.

48:29.180 --> 48:31.660
But I will probably still buy the game to play other people's games.

48:32.060 --> 48:32.980
That's the difference.

48:34.420 --> 48:37.220
So, yeah, but it would be it would be nice

48:37.220 --> 48:40.980
if Nintendo would just put out a player, then, you know, best of both worlds.

48:40.980 --> 48:43.060
Right. So. All right.

48:43.060 --> 48:45.580
Anyway, but that is that is a pleasant surprise out of Nintendo.

48:45.580 --> 48:48.900
And again, only like five weeks away. That's very surprising. Yeah.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.980
And that's also like June 11th.

48:50.980 --> 48:54.060
That's probably right smack dab

48:54.060 --> 48:57.660
in the center of when E3 quote quote stuff is going on.

48:58.860 --> 49:01.980
Yeah. Yeah, it would be.

49:02.300 --> 49:04.780
So that's also an interesting timing for that.

49:04.980 --> 49:08.460
And I bet Nintendo is probably going to dedicate a few treehouse hours

49:08.460 --> 49:11.100
to that game, even though it will be coming out at that time.

49:11.300 --> 49:12.540
They've done this before.

49:12.540 --> 49:15.700
There was another game that came out like the week of E3,

49:15.820 --> 49:16.980
and they were still showing it.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.460
And I don't remember in the moment arms.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.340
I think you're right. It was arms.

49:21.340 --> 49:24.020
I think it was arms. So anyway.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.740
Bobby Blackwell says the 11th is a Friday.

49:27.740 --> 49:29.940
Isn't the E3 stuff the next week?

49:30.540 --> 49:33.420
I might be wrong, but I think the E3 stuff is the next week.

49:33.420 --> 49:35.660
Like it's like the 13th, 14th, something like that.

49:36.460 --> 49:38.580
Of course, the 13th will be a Sunday.

49:38.580 --> 49:41.740
So I could be wrong, but it is the.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.660
Yeah, it starts Saturday.

49:43.660 --> 49:46.140
So it's the day after is when E3 starts.

49:46.140 --> 49:47.460
Oh, that's right.

49:47.460 --> 49:51.260
It's not the usual timetable this year anyway, because it's virtual.

49:52.580 --> 49:55.020
Oh, no, no, no change every year.

49:55.060 --> 49:57.780
Well, they've also sometimes the press conferences

49:57.780 --> 50:00.180
have started that far in advance as well.

50:00.620 --> 50:03.260
I remember that. But anyway.

50:03.380 --> 50:05.980
I just think it's interesting that it's so close to all of that.

50:05.980 --> 50:09.700
So just want you to know that the game awards were actually part of E3.

50:09.700 --> 50:12.500
It's just they started like six months in advance of E3.

50:12.940 --> 50:15.540
It's fine. No, no. Game awards are summer game fest.

50:15.580 --> 50:16.220
There's a difference.

50:16.220 --> 50:18.220
Loki can't camp.

50:18.220 --> 50:19.900
Keeley has his own thing.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.940
It's all part of the E3.

50:21.940 --> 50:24.860
That just takes place several months after E3. It's fine.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.820
All right. Let's talk about.

50:27.820 --> 50:33.940
OK, maybe maybe game garage builder camp thing is not up Dark Soccer's alley.

50:34.140 --> 50:35.820
But I know this one is.

50:35.820 --> 50:37.420
And it's releasing this Friday.

50:37.420 --> 50:41.260
It's the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is coming out this Friday.

50:41.820 --> 50:44.940
Dark Soccer, you have your all yours preordered and ready to go.

50:45.420 --> 50:47.500
No, no. Are you not?

50:47.500 --> 50:49.660
Because I said I'm going to get it.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.380
But I need to get my Windows virtual virtualization set up,

50:53.380 --> 50:55.940
which means I'm probably going to have to dish out the funds for

50:56.820 --> 50:59.620
for parallels

50:59.620 --> 51:04.620
because they've got a Windows arm for free that works now on the M1 Mac Mini.

51:05.260 --> 51:09.420
And all of my other games I've been playing have looked terrific.

51:09.420 --> 51:15.500
So I'm going to have to make sure that it's going to work for me playing it.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.340
And I don't want to get it through Stadia is the issue.

51:18.540 --> 51:22.460
I mean, and I do eventually want to get my Dead by Daylight stuff linked for

51:23.460 --> 51:26.500
on Steam as well so that I can just pick up where I left off.

51:26.820 --> 51:28.060
Yeah, that'll be that'll be nice.

51:28.060 --> 51:30.900
You'll get that benefit where I didn't coming from Xbox one.

51:30.900 --> 51:32.460
But that'll be nice.

51:32.460 --> 51:35.700
But anyway, well, I actually haven't preordered mine

51:35.700 --> 51:37.820
because I know I'm just going to walk into Target and get it.

51:37.820 --> 51:38.900
That's kind of what I do now.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.020
Like, I don't I don't trust games to deliver on time.

51:41.260 --> 51:43.700
I just I just go into Target and get them.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.980
But I I'm definitely going to pick up the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.

51:46.980 --> 51:51.180
I'll probably get it on Xbox one just because that's excuse me, Xbox Series X,

51:51.220 --> 51:53.420
because that's my most advanced console I have right now.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.620
And I played the original on Xbox 360 first.

51:56.620 --> 51:59.260
So it's kind of like it was kind of my home base for Mass Effect.

51:59.540 --> 52:03.300
And yes, this means I will be buying Mass Effect three for the fifth time.

52:03.860 --> 52:07.460
Shut up. But let's talk about the original Mass Effect,

52:07.460 --> 52:09.460
because that's where the most exciting changes are coming,

52:09.460 --> 52:12.460
is that they're really kind of given an overhaul to the first Mass Effect game

52:12.660 --> 52:14.660
to kind of catch it up to where two and three were.

52:14.660 --> 52:18.500
And of course, one of those quality of life changes is the Mako

52:18.500 --> 52:22.060
and driving that that's the car in Mass Effect.

52:22.060 --> 52:24.420
And it wasn't a lot of fun to drive.

52:24.420 --> 52:28.500
I don't remember hating it, but I remember thinking like this thing is a pain in the ass

52:29.860 --> 52:31.100
and they've they've fixed it.

52:31.100 --> 52:34.340
However, if you are a purist and you insist

52:34.700 --> 52:37.900
on driving the Mako the original way, good news.

52:37.900 --> 52:41.260
In an interview with PC Gamer, Kevin Meek from BioWare said,

52:41.420 --> 52:45.940
we've left the option to leave it back kind of closer to the original controls

52:45.940 --> 52:50.020
as well, if you want for those people out there who do like pain.

52:51.300 --> 52:55.140
Suffering. I love that he said that about his own game.

52:56.860 --> 52:58.060
But that you know what?

52:58.060 --> 53:00.780
You know what? There's always going to be that there's always that person

53:00.780 --> 53:04.580
on social media that's going to be like, I like the old way better.

53:04.940 --> 53:10.780
It was better the way it was before, even though everybody else dunked on it.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.740
There's going to be somebody that's going to say the old way was better.

53:13.820 --> 53:15.540
Well, guess what?

53:15.540 --> 53:18.260
Person, the ooh, she's different person on Twitter.

53:18.260 --> 53:21.700
Guess what? You get to have it both ways if you want.

53:21.900 --> 53:24.100
So that's the big news this week.

53:24.100 --> 53:27.140
Yeah. And I'm excited to play the legendary edition in a few days.

53:27.140 --> 53:29.340
That'll probably make up a chunk of my gaming week next week.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.620
I'm still a little sad there's no multiplayer, but I get it.

53:32.700 --> 53:35.100
I understand why that's not an option.

53:35.100 --> 53:39.660
All right. Phoenix 7726 says the galactic readiness

53:39.660 --> 53:42.420
in three will be significantly changed as well.

53:43.260 --> 53:46.620
Yeah, excuse me. Yeah, they're going to have to because there is no multiplayer.

53:47.380 --> 53:50.340
And I don't think the phone app is going to be a thing anymore.

53:51.300 --> 53:54.060
Excuse me. So I think they already said it's going to be much more based

53:54.060 --> 53:57.460
on like the things you did and didn't do earlier on in the trilogy

53:57.780 --> 54:00.380
and in the game three.

54:01.300 --> 54:05.380
Act Efton Chat says, Wait, Rob, you're not getting a copy for each console?

54:06.060 --> 54:10.020
No, you have to remember the reason why did I really buy Mass Effect

54:10.020 --> 54:11.660
three so many times?

54:11.660 --> 54:13.020
The multiplayer.

54:13.020 --> 54:14.820
There was no cross play back then.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.540
And I had people I wanted to play PlayStation on.

54:17.780 --> 54:19.700
I had people I wanted to play PC on.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.300
I had people I want to play Xbox on.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.580
So that was kind of the reason.

54:23.580 --> 54:28.060
Also, it really helps that Wii U version was on sale like dirt cheap.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.020
That's when I picked that up.

54:29.020 --> 54:31.700
And I think the PlayStation trilogy was on sale when I bought it, too.

54:31.940 --> 54:34.900
So because there's no multiplayer,

54:35.220 --> 54:39.020
I really don't see the need to get this on any other console.

54:39.020 --> 54:41.820
And I don't think I will.

54:41.820 --> 54:44.460
Never say never, I guess.

54:44.460 --> 54:45.460
Let's see.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.420
What was the other

54:49.420 --> 54:51.420
comment here? Oh, SD100Matt said,

54:51.900 --> 54:54.300
Will we see you stream any of it, Rob?

54:54.780 --> 54:57.300
I hadn't considered it because I didn't think people wanted to see it.

54:57.300 --> 55:00.060
But since you asked so nicely.

55:00.060 --> 55:03.300
Sure, I probably yeah, I can do a stream Friday night after work

55:03.940 --> 55:06.100
and do several hours of the first Mass Effect game

55:06.340 --> 55:07.860
and look at some of the changes.

55:07.860 --> 55:11.620
Streaming narrative games and RPGs is a little weird for me.

55:11.620 --> 55:13.780
I know other people do it. I know Dark Sakura is doing it.

55:14.140 --> 55:15.620
But for me, it's a little weird

55:15.620 --> 55:18.540
because I always feel like when you kind of pick up something in the middle,

55:18.540 --> 55:20.380
it's a lot harder to follow.

55:20.380 --> 55:24.340
But I like to do those first night games.

55:24.900 --> 55:27.380
And so, yeah.

55:27.380 --> 55:30.460
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says if it goes to play, I might think about it.

55:30.460 --> 55:34.540
It probably will eventually, but that could be a couple of years out.

55:35.100 --> 55:37.740
Keep in mind, the original trilogy is already on play.

55:37.860 --> 55:39.980
And I think it's interesting they didn't remove it or anything.

55:39.980 --> 55:44.340
So if you want to play the originals, is Mass Effect three on it?

55:45.100 --> 55:47.180
I don't recall. I know one and two are.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.300
But interesting.

55:50.700 --> 55:50.940
Dr.

55:50.940 --> 55:54.940
Tzuyu says, I hear there might be new DMCA concerns with the Mass Effect remaster.

55:55.100 --> 55:58.020
Saw something on Twitter that the music's in the library now.

55:58.420 --> 56:00.220
Well, they have until Friday to fix it.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.980
They did have a couple of licensed songs in the game, too.

56:03.220 --> 56:05.580
So that could also be messing with it a little bit.

56:05.620 --> 56:09.900
So, you know, play with the volume low in certain parts, especially the credits.

56:10.700 --> 56:15.100
Phoenix 7726 says, I wonder why they stripped out the multiplayer from three.

56:15.660 --> 56:16.660
They've commented on it.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.420
And it's basically that

56:19.420 --> 56:22.900
it wasn't the point of the remaster and it would have been extra resources

56:22.900 --> 56:24.900
to do all that.

56:24.900 --> 56:27.220
And so they they kind of left it.

56:27.700 --> 56:32.540
I would I wish they would do, you know, especially because the Mass Effect

56:32.940 --> 56:35.500
whatever project they're working on now that was announced

56:35.500 --> 56:38.060
at the Game Awards a couple of years ago, that project,

56:38.060 --> 56:40.860
we're not going to see until like 2024, probably.

56:40.860 --> 56:42.300
Let's be real. It's going to be a lot.

56:42.300 --> 56:44.380
We still don't have the fucking new Dragon Age game.

56:44.540 --> 56:46.260
And how long have they been talking about that?

56:46.260 --> 56:50.180
So that Mass Effect game, it ain't happening for a long time.

56:50.660 --> 56:54.980
It would be very nice if as a bridge in between, there was a multiple.

56:54.980 --> 56:58.100
And I've been seeing this for a goddamn long time.

56:58.900 --> 57:01.220
If they just had a multiplayer only game,

57:01.460 --> 57:05.660
a Mass Effect multiplayer only game in the universe, a 40 dollar game or something.

57:05.900 --> 57:09.020
Hell, do 20 dollars and charge for boxes or whatever.

57:09.020 --> 57:11.660
I still miss that. Like fucking people will play it.

57:11.900 --> 57:14.100
Dark Sakura will play it, like, you know,

57:15.260 --> 57:18.180
and she doesn't play a lot of multiplayer games that I can think of.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.300
So do it anyway.

57:22.820 --> 57:26.940
Phoenix 7726 says the question about that project is after the train wreck

57:26.940 --> 57:29.380
that was Andromeda, does anyone believe it could work?

57:30.220 --> 57:32.500
I feel like Andromeda's.

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
Yes, is the short answer.

57:34.500 --> 57:38.380
I feel like Andromeda has also gained a lot of favor with people

57:38.380 --> 57:39.860
the longer it's been around.

57:39.860 --> 57:42.260
I think you're seeing more and more people kind of come up and say,

57:42.580 --> 57:44.660
you know, Andromeda was done dirty.

57:45.260 --> 57:48.380
And that's exactly the point I've been saying since day one.

57:48.380 --> 57:50.340
Andromeda was done dirty.

57:50.340 --> 57:53.020
That game wasn't fucking finished when they released it.

57:53.340 --> 57:56.380
Now that it's finished, it's actually not bad.

57:57.020 --> 57:59.420
Yeah, it's a little different because it's in another universe.

57:59.580 --> 58:00.820
It's it's weird to get it.

58:00.820 --> 58:05.140
But if you really look at it as what it is at this point, a side story,

58:05.140 --> 58:09.900
a side adventure, a Star Wars, Rogue One, if you will, it's fine.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.580
I want to play through that again, too.

58:12.580 --> 58:14.340
So anyway. All right.

58:14.340 --> 58:17.580
Enough Mass Effect chat because we could go on for three hours just about that.

58:17.860 --> 58:21.540
Let's talk about a chatting program, Dark Sakura.

58:21.580 --> 58:22.540
I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.

58:22.540 --> 58:23.220
Dark Sakura is next.

58:23.220 --> 58:29.180
Sorry. Well, and I think that maybe a lot of people have even noticed this already.

58:29.540 --> 58:34.060
But Discord, which I mean, we use for how we communicate

58:34.060 --> 58:35.220
with each other for the show.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.740
So hi, we're an example.

58:36.740 --> 58:39.260
We're literally on it right now. Yes. Yeah.

58:40.260 --> 58:42.980
It's been really moving.

58:43.820 --> 58:47.020
Well, I wouldn't say past gaming communities,

58:47.300 --> 58:51.380
but it's expanding out into other other genre.

58:51.540 --> 58:55.300
There's non gaming specific servers like to focus on TV.

58:55.300 --> 58:59.500
I'm in one for Supernatural and there's role play groups and there's

59:01.860 --> 59:08.180
discussions and things for fantasy fucking football and dating even.

59:09.460 --> 59:14.460
There's groups for fans of TV shows to get together and watch it in Discord

59:14.900 --> 59:18.980
so they can watch throughout the the pandemic while they're quarantined.

59:19.420 --> 59:22.780
I know. I know people that pirate drag race that way.

59:22.780 --> 59:27.140
Basically, they have their view parties for drag race that they don't,

59:27.380 --> 59:30.540
you know, like an East Coast friend streams it so the West Coast

59:30.540 --> 59:32.540
friends can watch it. I'm not saying I've ever done it.

59:32.540 --> 59:34.900
I just know that that's the thing.

59:34.900 --> 59:38.260
Well, and one of the things that makes Discord special is that

59:38.700 --> 59:43.260
they're not funded from ads, they don't make any money from ads.

59:43.580 --> 59:47.340
They make their money through Nitro, which is a service

59:47.660 --> 59:51.420
that's either $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year.

59:51.900 --> 59:55.900
That gives some extra features like a high res video,

59:55.900 --> 59:58.500
animated emoji, a few other things.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.340
But I mean, but right now

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:06.220
they have more than 140 million monthly active viewers.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:12.260
And I mean, but in 2019, it was at 56 million.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.900
So it is already practically tripled. Yeah.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.900
19 million weekly active servers.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.260
So, I mean, it's pretty, pretty crazy.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:29.140
So but now I mean, like some professors

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.020
are using it to to teach their classes.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.580
And then, of course, Microsoft was interested

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.740
in buying a Discord for about 10 million.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.060
This was in March. Yep.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.260
But instead, now they have a partnership with Sony,

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.380
which we'll get into next.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.580
Yeah. But the thing, it's customizable.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.740
A lot of people find it as an attractive alternative to using Slack.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.700
And Slack, don't get me wrong, Slack is great

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.300
for businesses and nonprofits.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:07.380
I think that there's a lot more freedom for an open chat

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.660
forum using Discord than using Slack.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.500
Yeah, we still use Slack for Ingress stuff, too.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.460
Like when we had Slack at work, we had the big event in Ingress

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.060
in here in October, and we used Slack heavily for that,

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.340
for the planning and all that stuff.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.900
I'm sorry, October before the pandemic, October 2019.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:32.060
And yeah, I do like the threading that Slack has better over Discord.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.100
But there.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.940
I think Discord is better for a broader audience.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.660
Does that make sense?

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.260
The biggest thing that Slack really has is those integrations,

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.900
and you can integrate to a level. Discord has bots,

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.860
but you can integrate Slack to a little bit of a stronger degree

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.380
than you can Discord, if that makes sense.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.780
At least my perception is, based on the stuff I've seen,

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980
is that bots are cool, but they're bots.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.380
The integrations you do on Discord, or excuse me, on Slack

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.260
go a little bit further.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.380
So well, the thing, the really big thing to

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.580
to get from this, though,

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.740
is that with that exponential growth as it is,

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.420
I mean, and this is in about a year and a half, about.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.060
We're seeing all these other forums pop up on here,

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.020
and of course, Discord ain't mad about it.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.700
But I think that it's almost like how we were seeing things happen

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.660
with YouTube, right?

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.740
Where it was just, oh, these people's videos.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:40.100
Now we have like entire shows and music video releases and this and that.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.700
We're definitely seeing Discord become

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.220
I mean, I think at its core, it's still the gamers, right?

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.220
Yeah. Yeah. But but I think that there's room for everybody

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.740
in that play box, in that sandbox. Absolutely.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:59.180
Bob Coffey in our chat says all Discord is, is IRC with embedded cat pictures.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:02.500
Respectfully, no. Much better.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.860
Yeah, I get it, because what you described is kind of slack.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:13.460
Here's the thing that Discord has that slack doesn't and and an IRC doesn't.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.260
Look, we're doing it right now.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.740
This show, video chat, able to do this whole thing,

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.220
and if we wanted to, I could probably bring I mean,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.140
I have to have the layouts for it and everything, but I could.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.780
Well, I've done it before when I brought like Delvin or Shane or somebody

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.020
on here as a fourth chair and Jamie and I have been talking offline

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.900
about having some more fourth chairs in the future from the community and so forth.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.580
So we might, you know, we can do that all through Discord.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.980
And that, you know, especially now in the pandemic era,

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.780
that's something that IRC really couldn't bring us.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.060
IRC still had bots and all that cool stuff.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.060
Whoever played Acrophobia and that stuff on IRC, right?

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.740
So you still had some of that stuff.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.700
But the big, big difference, and I think really why Discord is going

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.420
to the moon right now, especially in the pandemic,

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.380
this pandemic has been a terrible thing.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.980
But let's be real, some companies have made a lot of fucking money off of it.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.260
And I'm not just talking about pharmacies.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.540
I'm talking about Zoom.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.460
Big one, right? The number one probably.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:17.220
And this Discord has done very well because of the pandemic.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:23.260
But isn't it kind of cool that like people that you never thought

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.500
would use video chat software are kind of able to use it now?

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.980
Like it's a very, if I can tell my, I can tell my 82 year old dad

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.740
to do a Zoom call and he knows how to do it.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.340
Yeah. That's it's become a necessity.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:41.300
Yeah. And this is what our culture is now.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:45.180
Now in chat, they're kind of having a side conversation here.

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.340
Phoenix 7726 asked, how does Microsoft solution compare?

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.380
And DJ Rama said it was Teams.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.620
Bobby says it's Microsoft Teams.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.100
And to be fair, I can't evaluate it.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:56.940
I've never used it.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.220
I use it at work.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.500
It's all right. It's all right.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.980
It's kind of, it's kind of very similar to Slack, isn't it?

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:09.580
It's not even really, it's more of like, um, I think of like an instant

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.740
messenger more and you can share, like, it feels like an instant messenger to

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.260
me and you can share like stuff.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.340
You can have chats, you can call people through it and do meetings,

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.820
but it's, it's not, it doesn't feel like Discord at all.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.420
Yeah.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.500
I mean, it's sort of set up, I guess.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.940
It's just a guest appearance, but yeah, you can set up different groups and

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.500
stuff like that and have discussions.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.300
I don't know if you can do groups within groups.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.420
Maybe you can, I don't know.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.140
But, um,

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.620
Isn't Teams like a kind of almost like a step ahead from Skype because at my,

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.780
okay, so at my business, we use Skype for business.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.380
Um, so we're still on that, like to chat and, and do the stuff we

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.340
need desktop share and stuff.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.340
But, um, uh, I keep seeing things about getting upgraded to Teams.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.300
So I think that might be coming in the future because I think

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.900
that's the next progression, but we'll see.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:57.420
We'll see.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420
Yeah, probably.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.140
Yeah.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:05:59.980
All right.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.340
Anyhow.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.660
Um, so dark soccer referenced something there that I know you

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.820
were going to elaborate on Loki.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:05.700
Yeah.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.580
So, um, Discord now is going to be integrated a little bit with, uh,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.500
PlayStation.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.780
So this is coming from the fact that Sony has actually invested a

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.900
minority stake in Discord itself.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.060
And the company's plan to bring Discord and PlayStation experiences closer

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:27.780
together on console and mobile starting early next year, and apparently

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:31.540
they're working hard on connecting Discord with, uh, the social and gaming

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.860
experiences of PlayStation network.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.300
I'm guessing maybe that'll show like which games you're playing.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:41.740
Maybe some sort of cross talk between, um, I don't know, like

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.300
the mate chat rooms and stuff.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.540
It'd be nice to see it for them integrate that.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.780
Cause aren't they getting rid of like the party chat and stuff like

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.260
that, or they're doing something with it.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.820
Well, they got rid of communities already.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:51.900
Communities.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.820
So maybe this is replacing communities.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.500
Um, be interesting to see if that's, that's what they're doing with it.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.460
Um, but yeah, I mean, I don't know.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460
It sounds cool.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.300
I can't wait to see what they do with it.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:10.700
I think it's important to remember that Microsoft also has kind of a partnership

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.500
with Discord, um, and that is that if you like link your Xbox account with your

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.620
Discord account, that, um, I think there's some benefits that crossover, don't quote

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.140
me on that.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:26.540
Um, but, uh, namely also, and this is the big one is that if I'm playing a game on

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.100
Xbox, you see it on discord, you know how like on discord, you can see so-and-so is

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.580
currently streaming or it says so-and-so is playing dead by daylight, which mine

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:39.020
probably says a lot, but if I'm on Xbox, I imagine it also will say is playing

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.140
Dragon Quest builders too.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:40.780
Like it does that.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.380
And so when I first read this story that I was kind of like, I think people are

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.220
going crazy with, it sounds like PlayStation is just doing the same thing.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.700
And they're, they're integrating discord in that regard.

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.780
Um, but it actually sounds like maybe PlayStation is planning to go a step

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.420
further with this, that like, now we really see, oh, this is why they got rid

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.340
of communities real fast.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.540
You know, they didn't give a lot of warning on the communities going away.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.060
It, maybe there really is going to be some integration within the console itself.

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.100
It would be exciting to see what they do.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.820
If they actually would just talk about it, you know, then we can figure it out and be

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.500
excited about it, but nope, let's keep it a secret forever.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.260
Yeah, be interesting.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.020
So maybe we'll find out more about this.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.060
This could be the type of thing that Sony unveils in an E3 timeframe.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.820
I know I say that a lot, but you know, it's, it's not far away.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.900
And especially if Sony has sunsetted communities as fast as they've done, I

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.540
think they're already planning something.

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.220
So we'll see.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.740
Um, well, maybe, maybe, okay.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.660
Maybe not so fast because some folks in chat, I guess, saw something I missed

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.060
as Joe and her mat says, we apparently won't see anything with it until 2022.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.500
Probably because the PlayStation firmware takes that long to update, honestly.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.860
Uh, and act-def says, there's gotta be some PlayStations to put it on, you know, so,

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.140
uh, act-def says the thing is that considering this isn't coming anytime

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.260
soon, it seems that there is more.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:08.500
So maybe we'll see kind of maybe we'll see like as a small first step.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:12.780
That whole, you know, what you plan kind of connection that Xbox has.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:17.100
And then maybe there will be more to it in, in 2022, like some actual

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.700
integration within the console itself.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:23.300
That'd be very interesting and very good news for Discord, who did not, is,

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.980
is venturing it alone and plans to be its own company and probably

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.420
its own IPO at some point.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.580
Way down the line, way down the line.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.060
All right.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.020
Excuse me.

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:40.140
Let's talk about this next story, which has to do with summer games done quick.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.900
I can't believe we're already at the point we're talking

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.340
about summer games done quick.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.100
This year has, like, weren't we just done with awesome games done quick?

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.180
Like this year is just like flown by, but, uh, a lot of people, of

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.860
course, look forward to these weeks.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.060
Not only are they a great charity event, but they're just a

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.300
lot of fun to watch, right?

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.300
Uh, speed running is, uh, it's, it's almost a sport of a sport within

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.700
of the video game community.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:08.300
Uh, and people can watch it, uh, a lot, just like they consume something like ESPN.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.860
So, uh, summer games done quick 2021 has, uh, basically released

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.820
all the games that will be played during summer games done quick.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.580
Now, the difference here, this is not the, what is being played

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.300
when list that comes later.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.900
This is just the list of basically like what's been accepted.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.100
So it's alphabetical.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.940
Um, there's still a lot of stuff to be determined about summer games done quick.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.700
Uh, for example, I believe our pal Bobby Black Wolf doesn't yet

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.340
know about the hosting thing.

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.460
Uh, I think there's still a little time on that.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.340
Uh, and, uh, some of the other things they have to figure out.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.340
Um, and yes, uh, is pointed out that summer games done quick is still going

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:48.700
to be virtual and that they announced that sometime ago, I think though, they

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.900
still have a skeleton crew at, at the home base hotel, um, that's kind

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.460
of like the master control switch.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.500
And honestly, now that, you know, vaccines are a thing, you got a lot more

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.220
States that are opening up in mid June.

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.340
I don't think that whole notion is as dangerous as it once was, but there is

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:11.860
probably still some hesitancy about, can we get 500 people in a room to watch this?

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.700
That that's the part where I think there's still a lot of hesitancy there.

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.820
So, um, yeah, yeah.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.460
Uh, anyhow, uh, yeah, Bobby says they always have a skeleton crew

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.300
that runs the stream in Virginia.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.300
I remember that cause you talked about it on previous show.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.900
Anyway, the list is out.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.860
It's way too long for me to read everything on it, but some

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.020
things that caught my eye.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.620
I love me some Bayonetta.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.260
Uh, the Batman video games on NES and Genesis.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.980
I thought it was cute that they kind of have both of those going on there.

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:44.780
Uh, cave story, 3d, uh, not too, uh, a recent ish, uh, game classic game of the

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:47.060
week, uh, you know, we love our Bemani.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.700
Uh, that's where our roots are here at orange lounge radio.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.940
Uh, and they've got dance rush stardom.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.180
That's that's the new one with the fancy floor.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.860
That's the new one.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.340
I see that.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:56.740
Yeah.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.380
That's the new one with the floor that, um, I I'm not coordinated enough to play.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.220
I've tried playing it.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.260
And the reality is when the show started, I was in my twenties

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.300
and now I'm in my forties.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.300
So a little different.

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:11.100
They're doing a dance show, disposable income someday.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.060
You know, I'll have to get one of those.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:14.420
Yeah.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.820
Well, anyway, you get to see an hour and a half of a dance showcase, uh, played

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.980
by Iji Ken, if I said that name, right.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.100
I'm sorry if I mispronounced the name.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.260
They're going to be amazing.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.140
Um, it looks like they're doing a destiny to raid of sorts.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.060
So I think that's kind of neat.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.700
F zero G X.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.660
Hell yeah.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.340
One of my all time favorites, uh, underrated, uh, in the more

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.420
recent department horizon, zero dawn.

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.020
Uh, well, I guess that game's a few years old at this point, but still it's

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.300
kinda, uh, dark Tetsuya, where you at?

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.140
Cause they're doing the La Mulana remake.

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.220
I know that's one of your faves out there.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.900
Uh, and for dark soccer, they're doing mass effect to, uh, speed run, and it's

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.420
going to be done in an hour and 31 minutes.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.900
My God, that's going to be something else.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.300
Lots of mega man games.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.020
I don't know how I feel about speed runs of mass effect.

01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.780
Maybe I'll watch it.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:03.260
It's it's, it's a novelty.

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.660
Let's just put it that, um, Pokemon games.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.140
Of course, there's going to be a black and white race.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:13.980
So that's going to be a, for that jet gen five, that would be so the gen five race.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.540
Uh, and then somebody is running Pokemon emerald.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.420
Uh, that'll be kind of fun to watch.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.260
Resident evil seven.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.740
Is getting speed runs, not eight yet.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.780
Eight's a little too new, but seven came out yet.

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:26.220
Yeah.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.580
Uh, watch them words, Loki, you know, they're already working on it.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.500
Watch them words.

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.620
It's it's absolutely being worked on already.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.340
And of course the old favorites, super Metroid is back.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.180
Uh, and there's a, you know, some Mario and, uh, I was trying to see

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.300
if anything else jumped out at me.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.260
Oh, for me, Zoda's revenge star tropics too.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.820
We don't talk about the star tropics series on NES enough, quite honestly.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.940
Um, because people don't even remember there was a second game.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.540
So it's kind of cool.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.900
That was totally a classic game.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.460
It maybe I haven't done Zoda's revenge, but I brought it up when it did.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.140
You did the first one.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.180
You didn't do the second one yet, but the second one is interesting because,

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.420
um, it was, uh, one of the, it was the next to last game on the NES.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.780
I believe warriors woods was last, but star tropics two is next to last.

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.740
So it's interesting for that reason.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:19.020
Um, Bobby Blackwell says resident evil eight will be at awesome games done quick.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.660
Oh, Bobby pointing out something I missed.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.580
There are no final fantasy games.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:23.940
That's interesting.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.100
Well, I guess let's take a long time.

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.620
They know it and they always do them.

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.020
And that's, I think it's okay to put something on the back

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.900
burner for a little bit.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.220
You know, jazz punk will be fun.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.060
I like that game.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:36.420
Yeah.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.700
Um, uh, what else do they have?

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.220
That looks pretty awesome in here.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.220
Uh, I don't know.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:44.540
Jeez.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.060
There's like so many mega mans questbusters.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.540
So they must be having a race for that.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.860
So following up your resident evil eight comment quest buster is commenting in

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.540
chat, uh, Bowser's fury already made the list.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.740
And that hasn't been out that long, all things considered.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.260
So it's February though.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.140
I mean, that's, I mean, that's still, yeah.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:00.300
Yeah.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:03.740
All right.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.860
Anyway, so go check out the list, uh, at games done quick.com.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.980
Uh, check that out.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.260
And, uh, I'm sure everybody will be watching the event later on this summer.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.420
So, all right.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.820
Uh, let's move on a dark Sakura with some more, uh, studio acquisition news.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.300
Indeed.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.580
And this, it has a little bit of significance on this one.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:27.980
So EA has bought, uh, a, uh, video game developer, uh, metal, metalhead

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:28.580
software.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:35.620
There's a creator of a game called super mega baseball and EA, of course, you know,

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.380
since they bought them, that means that they've got a new baseball franchise

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.420
under their belt now.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:47.460
And so, um, cause I mean, it's been over, over 10 years since their last, uh,

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.420
baseball SIM.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.660
That was MVP 07 NCAA baseball.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:59.340
So it looks like that this metalhead developed game, uh, is going to be

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.620
coming out as an EA title.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:08.500
Um, they are in, uh, uh, Victoria and their office is still going to be open

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.300
and functional.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:16.660
Um, but metalhead it's IPs are going to be owned by EA.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:17.820
So there you go.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.420
All right.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.980
EA is grabbing them up.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.500
So this means that they're looking back in the baseball genre.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.860
So it'd be interesting.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:27.620
All right.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.300
Uh, let's move on Loki.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:30.820
Yeah.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.940
So there's a, we talked about this once every few weeks or so about the new,

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.500
um, enhancements being done to some of these older games on Xbox with the FPS

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.940
boosting, where they're like doubling the FPS on certain games and whatnot.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:45.100
I was trying to get the full list.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:49.580
They added another 70 games, um, to it now.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.100
So it's ridiculous.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.780
Um, Right now, some of them wants to note, you know, they have Assassin's

01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:00.820
Creed, the Ezio collection, dying light, far cry, new Dawn, Lego worlds.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.220
Um, those are all now at 60 FPS.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.540
Uh, Metro last light at 120 FPS.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.940
Um, Metro is a great game.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:08.580
Seriously.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:13.220
It is important to know some of these you have to enable, like it's not just because

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.220
I believe sometimes the frame boost effects quality.

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:19.300
So for that reason, you have to enable it if you want it.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.100
So, um, there's a lot of guides out there from Microsoft on how to

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.860
do this within your Xbox console.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.940
So something you should be aware of.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.900
I believe if the game supports this, it has an icon that says so at this point.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:29.420
Yes.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:36.060
And the, the most important game, getting a 120 FPS mode, untitled goose game,

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:40.020
because I need that game to run at 120 FPS.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:45.980
Think of how fast I can honk now in that game with 120 FPS, you know, let's honk

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.740
on every single frame and, uh, and we'll do that.

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.820
So, uh, yeah, lots and lots of games that are backwards compatible,

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.020
uh, with that, the FPS boosts.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:01.900
I mean, we can't go over all of them, but there there's a lot.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.140
So, um, I was trying to see if there's any other notable ones on here.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.500
I can't tell what was already on that list that they added now, but it's a lot.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.180
There's a full list on xbox.com.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:16.380
If you're curious, I'm also sure it's probably listed in games pass.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.020
You know, what's on there, but look for the icons.

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.660
I mean, there's a ton of games and they're only, they're going to keep adding to it.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.660
So this is kind of what they're doing instead of backwards compatibility now.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.380
Well, I shouldn't say instead they claim they're still working on

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.980
backwards compatibility, but I, I what's left besides the DDR games.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.700
I can't, I can't think of anything, but I'm sure there's some, but, uh, yeah.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:38.500
All right.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.180
Have they beaten groovy yet?

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.220
Yes.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.700
You weren't expecting that answer.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.060
Were you?

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.060
But yes, that is compatible.

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:51.860
I don't think that one is, uh, neither is, uh, the rock band.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.580
Uh, I rock band blitz, but that's probably a music licensing thing.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.380
I'm going to play there.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.140
Who knows?

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.060
Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says we need a DJ hero remake.

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:02.580
Honestly.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:03.180
Yes.

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:07.180
Oh God, I would be there day one immediately.

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:07.860
Yeah.

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.500
Um, but absolutely by that, I don't know if it's going to happen.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:16.420
Cause that guitar hero reboot, as good as it was, didn't do unfortunate news.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.540
As we talked about last week, there can't be a DJ hero game.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.820
Cause all of the games now are being, are all the game companies now at

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.180
Activision are working on call of duty.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.100
So it's all called duty from now on.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.380
That's all that they're putting out.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:29.700
Womp womp.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:30.980
All right.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.340
Well, blizzard's putting some stuff out and, uh, of course the classics

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.380
that they're putting out are, uh, you know, there's a, there's a lot of,

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.660
they've been kind of dipping into the vault while they've been working on

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.340
some new games, uh, we know Diablo two remastered is coming later this year,

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.660
but coming a lot sooner on June 1st, the launch of world of Warcraft

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.620
classic, the burning crusade.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.820
Um, so this is something that was teased several months ago, uh, that

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.900
blizzard's going to be doing this.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.940
I think they've done some testing on it as well, but, uh, the burning

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.980
crusade will be launching on June 1st.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.220
Uh, this is kind of a big deal for me because this was the expansion

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.540
that really got me into wow.

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.860
I did play in vanilla, but I didn't play a lot in vanilla.

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.780
I subscribed for maybe like two months in vanilla.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.140
I started doing the rating and shit in the burning crusade.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.620
That's when I really got into wow.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:15.420
So I think this is really interesting.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:21.460
I'm, I'm not sure I have the drive to pay the monthly fee to do it again,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:28.020
but I'm also not going to say I'm not going to do it, so we'll see.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:32.340
Uh, and remember you pay, so you're ba you basically play a wow fee.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.900
And then with that monthly fee, you get to pick, do you want to play modern

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.180
wow, or do you want to play classic?

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:37.460
Wow.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:41.180
Now you might be wondering, well, aren't there going to be people that are going

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:45.140
to be pissed off because what happens to vanilla wow, here's the kind of neat,

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.860
interesting thing they're going to coexist.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.300
You're going to have wow.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.260
Classic classic vanilla.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:51.620
Wow.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.620
And burning crusade that coexist.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.620
So what's going to be happening in the next couple of weeks,

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.900
you get to make a decision.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:03.660
You decide, do you want to move your character ahead to burning crusade?

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:07.300
Or do you want to clone your character so you can keep playing,

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.740
but why wouldn't you just clone?

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.660
Maybe a, it might be character space limitations actually.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.020
Now that I'm thinking this out loud.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:17.020
So most people I imagine will probably just clone.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.340
I don't know why you wouldn't do that, but there might be some people that don't.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.980
Now for me, I don't even want to bring my character over.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.020
I would want to start a draenei or a blood elf, uh, and, and play the game

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.620
from that perspective all over again.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.580
In fact, the draenei starting area is so pretty in my head.

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:33.980
I'm making my draenei shaman.

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:34.780
This is dangerous.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.620
This is, this is dangerous.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:42.660
Um, but anyway, uh, yeah, so may 18th is when that is all being implemented and

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.140
you get to make your choice and while classic while classic also coming, coming

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:49.740
under a little bit of heat because they're starting to do some store and micro

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.340
transaction stuff with it, with some of the rare mounts and mounts you can't get

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:58.340
anymore, but of course people are like, there wasn't a micro transaction store in

01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:58.820
classic.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.340
Wow.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.460
Well, classic.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:01.700
Wow.

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.900
Didn't support widescreen either, but here we are.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:07.420
So, you know, it's a different times I suppose.

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:11.100
So, so some things, some things are not going to be a classic.

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:11.820
Yeah.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.900
Unfortunately though, this is, this is classic Activision, not classic.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:15.220
Wow.

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.180
That we're dealing with here.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.740
So there will be a micro transaction store.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.300
Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:25.260
So are we eventually going to have separate instances of the game at every

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.380
expansion point?

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:32.740
In my opinion, there they'll absolutely do this again for wrath of the Lich King.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:33.820
Absolutely.

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:34.740
That is going to happen.

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:38.620
That is what most people consider to be the pinnacle of wow was the wrath of the

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.660
Lich King, in my opinion, that's it.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.940
They don't go beyond wrath of the Lich King.

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.780
Um, the, the expansions after that, weren't quite as well received.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:54.020
Um, and I just don't, and I think that the viewpoint is going to be, if you want to

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:54.460
play Mr.

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.900
Pandaria, if you want to play, you know, Legion or something, then play modern.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:22:59.220
Wow.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:22:59.740
It's there.

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:00.500
It's still there.

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:05.420
Um, and I don't think they've really changed Pandaria.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.220
Cause that would be the expansion after wrath of the Lich King in modern.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:10.660
Wow.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:15.460
I think they've done little changes to Outland and they've done changes to even

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:19.460
Northrend and they certainly changed vanilla.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:19.860
Wow.

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.580
No cat.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:21.460
Oh no.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:26.060
Cataclysm was after, um, wrath of the Lich King.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.660
That's why they have to stop because cataclysm completely changed.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.700
Um, am I mixing them up in my head?

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.060
Huh?

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.820
I can't even remember what order these expansions were in anymore.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.380
It was no cataclysm was out.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.220
Not, not Pandaria.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.020
Cataclysm was after before the pandas.

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:43.380
Okay.

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.180
Okay.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:49.140
So then my point is, but cataclysm completely changed vanilla.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:49.580
Wow.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.940
So they have to stop there because then vanilla wow is done.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.820
Um, although of course, could they have all these servers that are frozen in time?

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:01.700
They could, I just, a cataclysm was not as well received as the others.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.140
Um, I would be very surprised if they go past wrath of the Lich King, but if they

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.700
have enough people playing it, then they might.

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:08.900
So I don't know.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:10.460
All right.

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.740
Uh, bonds, double six, questioning my choice of going Draenei saying, I don't

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.060
know, Rob, I'm for the horde.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.660
Uh, and bonds double six says the Lich King, just a big man, baby who

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.020
wanted more than he deserved.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.980
Well, you know, some, some epic, epic grades and stuff though.

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.300
I mean, there's going to be people that would absolutely want to

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.940
run ice crown citadel again.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.620
I don't know why, but they will for sure.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:32.660
All right.

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:37.380
Well, since we're talking about classics, Let's talk about a classic classic.

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.660
It's that part of the show where dark soccer is going to step into the gaming

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.260
vault and find a game that she thinks.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:46.660
Hey, forget signing up to pay your monthly fee so you can play classic.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:46.900
Wow.

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.940
All over again, you find this, find a cartridge of this and suffer

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.340
because this game was fucking hard.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.460
I got to, I got to tell you Alan's comment on this pick a little later.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.260
Cause he saw me pulling the B roll down tonight and he's like,

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.540
Oh, I got stories about this.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.460
Um, but let's get to it.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.180
Dark soccer.

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.900
You like to step into gaming vault, find a game that kids should be playing.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.820
What is the classic game of the week?

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.780
It is the Simpsons, Bart versus the space mutants.

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:15.980
There it is.

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.900
And so this game is not the best of all games.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:27.540
I will say that sometimes I'd pull out a stinker, but it is notable for being

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:34.940
one of the best known games based off of the Simpsons, one of the very early ones.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:39.140
Um, it, uh, it came out in 1991 for the NES.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:45.420
It also came out for the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64,

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.300
uh, and the ZX Spectrum, and then in 92 for the Sega Genesis,

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.060
master system and Game Gear.

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:58.380
Um, it was published by Acclaim, RIP, and Ocean Software, uh, for the

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.580
computers and was developed by, um, Imagineering and Arc Developments.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:09.380
So basically with this one, um, you start off as playing Bart.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.940
Oh, for the record, the Amiga and MS-DOS versions had a different

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.460
animated intro that was basically like a digitized clip from the show.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.020
Anyway, um, it is a 2D side scrolling platformer.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.820
You play in a single player game.

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:28.900
You play as Bart, um, and he is the only one who knows, uh, of the, uh,

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:34.300
aliens, uh, plan because his X-ray specs allow him to see them kind of

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.180
like they live, you know, obey.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:45.220
At any rate, um, he, uh, has to basically stop them from picking up certain items

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.020
they need for an ultimate weapon.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.580
Um, and he goes through five levels, um, and he has to either collect or

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.820
destroy certain objects, purple things in the first level, hats in the second,

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:00.580
balloons in the third, exit signs in the fourth and nuclear rods in the fifth.

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.420
If he loses a life, he says, eat my shorts.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:08.100
Um, and then of course the other objective is for Bart to convince

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:12.540
his family about the aliens so that they'll help them in levels.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.260
So, um, you have different equipment, you have rockets and cherry bombs.

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:23.380
Um, you can buy them with coins that you collect when the aliens are, are vanquished.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.900
Um, you have to jump on their heads to get rid of them.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:34.580
Um, and then in some time and the first level you can call Mo and prank him

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:38.500
so that you get spray paint, you know, so all kinds of interesting stuff.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:46.380
Um, and, uh, it actually is, you know, one of the earliest games, uh, based

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:51.780
on the Simpsons, uh, has the theme song from the show and it was designed

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:58.660
by, uh, Gary kitchen who developed Keystone capers and pressure cooker for Activision.

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:06.620
Um, and as far as the reviews that it got, it was a best seller.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:13.540
I mean, it sold pretty well, but critics have been, eh, critical?

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:20.100
Um, some places said that the game was both difficult and boring.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:25.260
Um, Nintendo power gave it a 66 out of a hundred.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:32.060
And the quote is his adventure though, is anything but a game for underachievers.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.700
It is very challenging and could be frustratingly so to some players.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:47.300
Um, but you know, it's one of those games, however, that sticks out in, I would say

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.860
in the mental history of people who lived through that era, who know

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.820
when it, who knew when it came out and yeah, I played it and yeah, it's hard.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:03.220
I kind of didn't care for it myself, but it is, I would put it in the area

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:05.740
of being fairly notable, wouldn't you say?

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.700
I would say, yeah.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.700
Um, did you ever play it?

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:15.980
I did play it.

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:19.180
Um, I think I may have had to use the Game Genie with it,

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.820
but I did quite a bit.

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.900
I played all of the Simpsons games actually on both the

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.380
Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.700
So, um, most definitely played this.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:32.780
I remember it being extremely hard and I don't know, just kind of weird.

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.740
Yeah, it was, it was weird.

01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:36.260
I was just gonna say, I did not play it.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.700
Um, I, I did not get into the Simpsons games until Bart's

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.380
Nightmare on the Super Nintendo, which I'd played a little bit of that.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.540
Um, which also was funky.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.500
What's that?

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:47.540
I said that one was definitely a better game.

01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:51.260
Not by much, but yes, better because of the platform it was on.

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.380
But I will say, so Alan saw me grabbing the B-roll for this tonight

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.820
and he's like, Oh, this game.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:00.020
But he played it and he said he'd beat it, which I was pretty impressed

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.020
by because I know this game was notorious for its difficulty for one.

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.220
But he also pointed out that, um, it had really good homages to the show.

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.740
Like, especially when you consider it's on the NES, you know, it was

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.740
where most people know it from.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:12.940
Yes.

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.740
I know there's Amiga and that stuff too, but most people know the NES version.

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:19.180
Like, you know, the fact that it has, you know, a pretty, pretty, uh,

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.700
true to form crank call in it.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.180
All the characters and references from the early seasons of the

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.500
Simpsons, which I don't know about you guys, but those are the only ones.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.100
I remember.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.180
I can't, I can't tell you anything.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.780
The Simpsons has done in the last 20 years.

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.500
It blows my mind.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.900
The show is still on quite frankly.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.180
Um, it has been fairly prophetic though.

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.780
Yeah, it's uh, yeah, that's true.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.180
That's true.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:39.380
Yeah.

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.740
Cause didn't it, didn't predict that like Trump would be president

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.340
like years and years before.

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.340
There's, that's not it.

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.100
There's like a lot of other stuff too.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.620
So yeah.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:52.380
Um, but I think also, you know, as much as this game was not like

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.900
super well received critically.

01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:00.740
I think this really speaks to the power of the licensed games back in the day.

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.540
And I think there's a big difference between back in the day licensed games.

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.580
And now, like now I think it's kind of like a running gag that things that are

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:10.740
based on movies and stuff usually stink.

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:14.260
But back in the day, like a license would really sell a game.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.860
Fucking look at ET on the Atari.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:21.220
You know, that was, they, they, they, they wrote everything on that game.

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:25.140
And even though ET is not solely responsible for the, the video game

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:29.140
crash, even though many people like faulted for that, um, it was definitely

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:34.020
a reason, um, and I think just, you know, spoke to the power of like what licenses

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:39.540
can do for selling games based on name alone, quite frankly, especially in the

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:43.900
example of ET and I think why this is a worthy classic game of the week, dark

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.660
Sakura, because there isn't a lot of stuff like it on the NES there's other

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.420
licensed stuff, you know, but I, the Simpsons one in particular, the way it

01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:57.820
sold so well, I think is all because of, you know, the fact that it's, it's a

01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:58.540
Simpsons game.

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:02.060
And because it's a video game on the NES, it looked a little more like the cartoon.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:08.660
Yeah, it was pretty good for a NES game, you know, as far as graphically.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:09.440
Yeah.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.340
And I also, I did not know I learned this for the first time tonight.

01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.180
Thanks to dark Sakura.

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.580
I had no idea the guy behind Keystone capers did this.

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:19.220
I loved as far as like, as far as Atari classics go, I think that

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.660
one is extremely underrated.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.940
I may have even done that.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.940
I'd have to check the Wiki.

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.740
I may have done that as a classic game on one of the weeks that you weren't

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.340
here, dark Sakura, because I think it's, it's that good of a game.

01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:31.820
That's why I brought it up.

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:32.500
Oh, okay.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.500
Well, there you go.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.660
That was a long time ago though.

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.980
If I did, I don't remember talking about it.

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:37.140
It was probably a while ago, but yeah.

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:40.620
Um, that's the, that's the game.

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:41.380
All right.

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:41.940
There it is.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.180
Bart versus the space moons.

01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.060
Um, before I take us back here, I do want to point out, um, in chat

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.260
quest buster is saying a claim was huge on licensed games.

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.660
They also made a lot of bad games.

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:51.140
That's right.

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.300
They, they made some good stuff and they made some bad stuff.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.460
Weren't they also, um, wizards and warriors.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:58.380
Wasn't that a claim?

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:01.620
No, that was, or was that rare?

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:02.660
That was rare.

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:04.420
I think it, no, I don't think it was rare.

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:04.700
Hold on.

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.380
I'll double check.

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.020
Okay.

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.420
Um, let's see.

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.980
And then, uh, the, the many folks in chat claim, it is a claim.

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:12.220
Okay.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.620
And then many folks in chat talking about, um, arcade Simpsons being

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.300
the one that people really remember.

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.060
Yes, absolutely.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:22.100
But for whatever reason, and probably just due to the licensing issues and

01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:27.020
stuff, the, the arcade version of the Simpsons never existed on the NES.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:27.500
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.140
They finally got the Ninja turtles game on it.

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.860
I don't think they ever did the arcade Simpsons on the NES.

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:35.820
I don't think it was till there may have been PC version, I think,

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.260
uh, or a computer version.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.700
But, um, yeah, that's the one that certainly a lot of people remember.

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:41.380
Okay.

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.460
So DJ Rama asks, uh, on the wizards and warriors, it was both rare developed

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.620
it, a claim published it, so it was both names on that.

01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.780
That's why my brain was hurting.

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:51.620
Okay.

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:52.580
Awesome.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.620
Uh, orange, right.

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:56.260
Says it was only ported to dos.

01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:56.420
Yeah.

01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.700
I thought I remember playing this one.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:01.740
He also thinks maybe Commodore 64, which surprises me, but also doesn't

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:05.900
because the Commodore 64 was still a huge platform into the early

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.300
nineties and other countries.

01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.780
So interesting.

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:09.540
All right.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:12.180
Anyway, uh, a lot to say on that one.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:12.380
Huh?

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.580
Great pick dark Sakura.

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.060
I mean, yeah, it's not, it's not something that's remembered for being

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:21.860
great, but I think it is remembered for being, um, Important, I guess, you

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.740
know, not just in it's, it's a urban legend of how fucking hard it is, but

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:30.060
just a licensed game that really kind of sold a lot on the NES.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:36.180
So, all right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:38.540
other things going on in the industry kind of quickly here.

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.740
So Loki, we'll start with you.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:40.740
Yeah.

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:43.700
I came, I need to go back and play as a Yakuza, like a dragon.

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:48.860
And it's kind of cool to see that there, uh, the studio behind it is

01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:53.900
actually talking about some future releases in the, uh, Yakuza series.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:59.060
And they're saying that they're going to be following the same game style

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.900
with turn-based RPG combat instead of just the standard brawler.

01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:05.260
So, uh, I'm all about that.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.340
I can't wait to check out the new game.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:10.940
Um, so coming soon, I guess at some point.

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:19.100
And then, um, for PlayStation plus in may, we've got a few games that are going to

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.140
be available, uh, with your subscriptions.

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:27.220
So looks like a rec fest on PlayStation five stranded deep on PlayStation four

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:30.060
and battlefield five on PlayStation four.

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.260
And those are available until June 1st.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.580
Um, cool.

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:36.780
All right.

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.860
And, um, Bobby and chat mentioning that judgment is the brawler line.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.180
And yeah, I caught that about that split with Yakuza.

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.500
Does that speak to the Yakuza, like a dragon performed pretty darn well.

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:52.180
And so they want to make more games like that, but that might have helped

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.700
that it was one of the only truly, um, next gen titles available when

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.580
series X launched, I think, uh, probably help.

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.660
I still need to play it, um, at some point, but I, you know, I know Bobby

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.980
played through the whole thing and really enjoyed it and he's not the

01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.380
only one I've heard kind of mentioned that.

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.140
So that's interesting that the, the series is kind of pivoting like that,

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.860
but at the same time, you know, you know, there'd be people that would be

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:15.660
pissed if the main Yakuza series, you know, completely took that over and,

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.460
and adopt that format.

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.140
So it's nice that the judgment series kind of also exists for

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:22.460
fans of, uh, you know, classic Yakuza as it were at this point.

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:23.300
So, yeah.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.060
All right.

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:28.940
Um, Questbuster says, as someone that has played every game in the Yakuza

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.500
series, except for the Japan only releases like Isshin, uh, I'm okay with

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.100
this change.

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:37.140
I think, I think most people are because both games still exist.

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.460
They just have different titles.

01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.460
It's not the end of the world.

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.580
You can buy, you can buy both.

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.180
You can buy neither.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:41.980
You can buy one or the other.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:43.020
All right.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.100
Uh, Dar Sakura, please.

01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:52.260
So, uh, Shirley, who is, uh, Shirley Curry, who is the, uh, uh, Skyrim playing

01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:59.540
grandma, um, she actually now has her own mod and she's provided her voice for it.

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:06.100
Um, so it's, uh, basically called Shirley, a Skyrim, uh, mod.

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.620
She, uh, it's up on Nexus.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:14.420
She's in there as a, uh, she'll give you some stories of her adventures and has a

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.340
little house and some unique items and a quest to complete.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.820
She has been immortalized in the game she loves.

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:21.940
That's awesome.

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:22.260
Thank you.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:22.740
Modders.

01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:24.100
Also, you can't marry her.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:31.420
Well, wait, wait, until, until the modders mod the mod.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.780
I think, I think it was one of the things she decided.

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:37.260
They will, they will do it.

01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:42.260
Can the modders mod the mod and make grandma's neighbor mod.

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.260
Starring Bea Arthur.

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.460
Yes.

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:46.820
So, and next story.

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.300
And then there's mod.

01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.020
All right, go ahead.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:50.780
Okay.

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.540
Nobody under 40 is going to understand what I just did.

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.300
All right, go ahead.

01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:01.220
Avex, which we know Avex, uh, tracks great, you know, music producer is going

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.460
to be bringing back cyber trance series, but a little bit more modern.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:11.980
Um, it was, is definitely one of those, uh, compilations that I really

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:17.900
enjoyed, uh, you know, in the, the early aughts and I think it's going to be great.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:22.940
They've also brought out a cybertrance, the fifth cybertrance YouTube channel.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:31.260
And, um, they, uh, are bringing back also the Velfar cybertrance series is

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.100
going to be available for streaming.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:36.460
So that's really awesome.

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:37.820
And they're going to take all that money.

01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.220
I I'm excited for this too.

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:43.020
Jason even references in the intro that he's, you know, shout out to Jason, who

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:46.940
does all our voiceovers here, if you didn't know, um, he, uh, uh, was talking

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.820
about that in the intro and I'm like, yep, pretty much the same, you know, I'm,

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.780
I'm looking forward to this too.

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.700
I didn't know they already had stuff posted on YouTube.

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:56.100
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, uh, the song on their YouTube was pretty sick.

01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.740
So I'm going to need to check that out.

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:03.100
I just hope, unlike last time, I hope this time they put it up on streaming

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:08.220
services so that we're not just having to trade like burn CDs, um, which I know

01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:11.860
you're not really sure check Apple music real quick, which please do.

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.500
Cause if it's there, it's going to be everywhere.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:19.300
Um, uh, but, um, now in the days, you know, the nice thing is the streaming

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:22.100
services, you're seeing more of the international stuff, especially when it

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:25.060
comes to video game stuff, uh, is going on those services.

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:26.460
So that's pretty cool.

01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.420
Um, sadly, what's still not on streaming services.

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:34.460
Cause I was just thinking about this the other day is that the dance maniacs

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:39.300
series that a lot of the DDR originals came from still not on, so there are

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:45.300
some cybertrance stuff up on there, but I don't see anything really recent.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:49.420
There's, uh, the, uh, uh, Hamasaki Ayumi stuff.

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.820
There's cybertrance presents iutrance too.

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:57.900
So it's some of the, um, older stuff is up there, but the stuff is there.

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:03.980
I remember what put me down that road because I realized Spotify released a

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:09.260
lot of back catalog erotic, the band that was in DDR, you know, do it all night.

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.980
Do we have all that stuff?

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:14.500
So their back catalog, like all their CDs are available on Spotify now.

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:17.260
And I imagine if it's there, it's Apple music and you know, all the places you

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:23.500
listen to music, um, and, uh, the, including their ABBA album, which I'm

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.420
gonna tell you the cover of angel eyes that erotic does, which is a very

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.540
underrated ABBA song.

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.580
Number one, number two, erotic does a killer job of that song.

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:37.100
So that made me think, where's that dance mania erotic nonstop mega mix.

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.340
Remember that album?

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:39.540
That album was great.

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.060
That's where cat's eye came from.

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.660
And then they had a bonus track.

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:45.620
That's probably one of the best songs they've ever had called in in Moncure.

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.740
And they covered cat's eye.

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.060
Yeah, that was a cover.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:48.460
That's right.

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.900
Cat's eye was a cover, but the actual mix and DDR was on that mega mix CD.

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.420
Um, so anyway, this is, this is, this is super nerdy DDR stuff from back

01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:59.660
of the day when we were, this is what we would talk about nonstop was this stuff.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.380
Um, I wanted that album so bad, but that is not on streaming services.

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:06.740
And that made me go down a rabbit hole of dance mania stuff.

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:12.340
A lot of it's on YouTube though, somehow, um, without, uh, getting

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:16.740
copyright strikes, but I thought that was interesting anyway.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:17.340
Sorry.

01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:20.580
I know that's supposed to be rapid, but it was a throwback.

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:25.940
You, you tackled it ish rapid, rapid dash, rapid throw up, wait.

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:28.660
No, in that rapid throw up.

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:29.340
All right.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.060
Let's travel.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.540
Sorry, I've been playing a little bit too much of the plague.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:34.060
All right.

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.700
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:40.420
we'll probably getting be getting a little sooner than the erotic mega mix

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.580
from dance mania on Spotify and Apple music.

01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:43.180
Yeah.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:43.420
Yeah.

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.500
We ain't getting that this week.

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.140
I'm sorry.

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:52.300
Um, this week we're getting hood outlaws and legends on PC, PlayStation four,

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:57.300
PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X, uh, Ruby grim eclipse,

01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.340
definitive edition on Nintendo switch.

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:04.340
Famicom detective club, the missing air and Famicom detective club.

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:08.860
The girl who stands behind, uh, both on Nintendo switch mass effect,

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:14.860
legendary edition on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, sub Nautica on

01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:19.820
Nintendo switch sub Nautica below zero on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.420
four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.020
That's it.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.220
All right.

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.660
Let's travel over to Japan.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.020
Golden week is over.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.900
So now we're back to release dates in Japan.

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.940
Um, and, uh, we have a couple of things this week that sub Nautica and sub Nautica

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:38.060
below zero pack on switch that is also out this week in Japan, uh, also the

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:42.420
Famicom detective club, the missing air and the girl who stands behind, uh, has

01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.900
a collector's edition coming out this week.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.660
Um, I believe those are coming out in the U S as well.

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.980
Uh, and, um, I know some folks are looking forward to that, but those,

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.140
the Japan's getting it too.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:55.340
Uh, so those are out on may 14th and that's, what's on the switch.

01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:00.660
Uh, PlayStation five actually gets sub Nautica below zero as well in Japan this

01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:00.940
week.

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.300
So you have that to look forward to.

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:06.540
And then on the PlayStation four, um, we have the sub Nautica below

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.220
zero and that's about it.

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:13.260
Um, uh, Oh, Moto GP 21 is also out this week on PlayStation four.

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:16.460
Um, not the mass effect legendary edition in Japan.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:20.140
I imagine they'll have to wait a little bit to get a localized version of that.

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.860
Uh, how about the UK?

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:22.380
Darc, Sakura?

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.860
Oh, only a handful.

01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:26.940
We have all on the 14th.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.220
We have Brigadine.

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.340
We have sub Nautica below zero and mass effect, legendary edition.

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:34.580
All right.

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:36.740
Well, with mass effect, what else do you need?

01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:38.700
All right.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.220
We have, did you say what else?

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.460
Because those don't exist.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.260
All right, let's move on.

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.860
Uh, we have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.020
get to the listener round table.

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.980
I'm putting a new twist on it tonight.

01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.780
I haven't even told my co-host, but it'll be a good one.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.900
We're putting a new twist on the listener round table tonight.

01:43:58.220 --> 01:43:59.980
So I'll talk to more about that in a minute.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:01.460
What a twist.

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:02.180
What a twist.

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.100
I know I'm M Night Shyamalan-ing this right now, so let's do it.

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.300
All right.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.540
Loki, what's next?

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.700
So there's apparently a class action lawsuit against Sony

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.300
over the PlayStation store.

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:19.460
They call it a price monopoly being that, Hey, it is on the PlayStation

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:23.180
and there's only one storefront that you can purchase games on the PlayStation.

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:28.340
As such games are probably more expensive on there than you would

01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:31.540
find at retail in a competitive market.

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:32.620
They're alleging.

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:35.820
Nobody tell these guys about the eShop.

01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:36.340
Okay.

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.740
Nintendo actually, you know, I take that back.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.260
Nintendo is just ridiculous prices all the time.

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:45.580
Um, and that's both physical and, uh, digital, but can't you buy

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:46.940
Nintendo stuff on Humble Bundle?

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:52.380
You can, but it's not like what I'm complaining about is that they've

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:56.780
got, you know, their gains are always $60 and they never discount them eventually.

01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:00.100
Um, it's very rare that you find that stuff discounted.

01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:05.780
Although I must say that I visited the local Target and they have a good stack

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.780
of gaming watches marked down to $49.99.

01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:15.620
So, you know, maybe time, maybe soon time to pick one of those up.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.140
Let's wait till they get lower.

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:19.460
$19.99.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:19.660
Yeah.

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.020
Wait, wait for $19.99.

01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.660
Absolutely.

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:23.860
All right.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.380
Yeah, that's what they're alleging so far.

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:28.580
They didn't give any sort of examples of like, Hey, this game is this much here.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.700
And this much here.

01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.380
Um, it's right now, it's a complaint.

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.700
I'm guessing probably just to take, you know, aim at Sony when Epic is taking

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.820
aim at Apple and then granted if.

01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:43.180
However, the court, you know, rules with the whole Apple thing, you know, about

01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:46.940
having multiple storefronts available on, you know, kind of these, uh, closed

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.940
marketplaces, we'll see how that affects some of these other storefronts.

01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:53.980
Somebody's trying to set the stage to have it trickle down to PlayStation.

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:54.500
Basically.

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:57.300
I think that's what they're trying, but I think it, it's going

01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:58.220
to be a hard sell right now.

01:45:58.300 --> 01:45:58.660
It is.

01:45:58.660 --> 01:45:59.940
It's, it's going to be a bit of a gamble.

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:00.500
That's for sure.

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:01.300
Yeah.

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:02.260
All right.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:04.780
Um, well, we're going to go to the next story.

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.500
Um, unfortunately my computer froze.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.980
Can anyone assist me on the next story here?

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.220
Um, sure.

01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:12.540
Um, Oh, go ahead.

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.140
Do you want to do it?

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.580
Uh, you can do it.

01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:15.100
Sorry.

01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:15.260
Okay.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.540
Live radio sucks.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.980
So as we were talking about, um, you know, and it just makes sense.

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.100
Uh, games com 2021 is going to be an online only event after all.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.820
Originally they were talking about some sort of, you know, a hybrid

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:31.300
event, but now it's just, let's just go digital.

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:34.980
I mean, with the way the pandemic is, you know, better safe than sorry.

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:39.340
So a lot of folks, you know, already different events going purely digital.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:42.100
So it makes sense that this year they're going to be doing the same.

01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:44.740
Um, it's still going to be happening.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:47.860
It looks like August 25th through the 27th.

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:52.180
So we'll have to look forward to what they're going to announce during that time.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:54.420
Yay.

01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:55.500
Awesome.

01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:59.700
Well, well, and I have some interesting news as well.

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.220
It is my turn, right?

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.060
Yes, please.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.220
Okay.

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:12.220
Um, we have our inductees to the 2021 world video game hall of fame.

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.460
Got some interesting ones on here and none of them are surprising, except

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.300
that they haven't already been there.

01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:26.260
So out of all of these, uh, finalists, we now have star craft.

01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.140
We have where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.340
Of course.

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.260
Microsoft flight simulator, which I think that one's been a bit overdue

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:42.860
and drum roll, the very first animal crossing, which was out in Japan as

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:53.340
double tsunami E plus the game P version finally, and it is a well-deserved.

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:56.900
Well-deserved they're all really, really top-notch inductees.

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.900
Is there some type of maybe like age requirement?

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.500
I mean, I don't know if you know, but maybe there's an agent because, um, that

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.180
game would be right about 20 years old.

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.140
So it was like the rock and roll hall of fame.

01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:11.140
I think you have to have your first single or whatever, like 30, 20 years.

01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:11.500
I don't remember.

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:14.020
So maybe there's something with that going on there.

01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:18.060
Just saying, has it be on our classic game of the week list?

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:23.260
So, you know, anybody, they're just leeching on our shit.

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:23.940
Yeah.

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:27.740
We, we have, we have our own hall of fame.

01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.340
That's for sure.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:29.380
We do.

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:30.460
All right.

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:31.740
There's some sticky ones in there.

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:34.540
Uh, let's move on Loki.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.500
So this is stupid.

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:42.940
Um, I'm just going to say that now, but apparently there is a blizzard is blocking

01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:47.340
or has filed a notice of opposition with the patent and trademark office to block

01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:55.140
Fox, uh, as in the, the television network from trademarking Diablo as one of the

01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:00.140
canine characters in the brand new, uh, series housebroken, which is about dogs.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:08.700
So, um, blizzard is stating that there may be, um, some confusion that says in the

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:12.860
view of the fact that the marks at issue are identical and in consideration of

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:17.340
other factors, such as a relationship between the imposter's goods and services

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:21.020
as identified by market Diablo and applicants goods and their commercial

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.500
strength, uh, it's likely members of the public will erroneously believe that

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:27.100
applicants goods, basically they're saying they're going to be confused.

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:32.180
I'm not going to be confused when I see, and as they say, the different things

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:38.180
that they're going to be using this patent for a trademark for, um, Diablo

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:42.980
pet bowls or pet treats, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to think that, Oh,

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:44.780
blizzard's putting out pet treats.

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:50.060
Blizzard has pet litter that they're marketing their game with.

01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.140
It's stupid.

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:54.380
It is absolutely stupid.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.580
And I hope that they punish them for this because it's ridiculous.

01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:01.460
I'm not as likely to fall as hard on blizzard on this.

01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:05.340
Um, I think the issue is that Fox wants a trademark on Diablo.

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.180
And so blizzard wants to protect their existing trademark.

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:12.780
Uh, yes, it's a stretch, a lot of these things, but what about a

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:16.020
t-shirt that says Diablo on it?

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.420
What are they talking about?

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:18.980
They're talking about the dog and they're talking about the game.

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:21.180
Now, I guess a lot of that's going to depend on what's it look like.

01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:22.260
Yeah, exactly.

01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:29.700
Like, so like the name Diablo, I mean, there's, we have, we have a park in

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:33.180
California for, well, there's a volcano or there used to be a walking Mount

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:36.180
Diablo, um, are they going to Sue the mountain?

01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:40.180
I mean, no, no, because the mountain's not trying to trademark the name.

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.060
But it doesn't matter though.

01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:46.820
Like if the, if the actual treatments are like completely different, I don't

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.140
see the point what they're going to be.

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:50.940
There's no confusion is what they're.

01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.660
I mean, they have to say that there's confusion because otherwise they don't

01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:56.540
have a case, but like it, there's no confusion here.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.460
I agree.

01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:58.340
It's a stretch.

01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:03.420
What I don't agree with is that I do think that blizzard is taking issue.

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:05.900
I see how blizzard ended up in court with this.

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.380
They're taking issue to the fact that someone else is trying to trademark

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:13.220
Diablo, perhaps if they don't defend it, then they look like they're willing to

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:16.260
give it up or whatever, especially when they've got a couple of games coming out

01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:19.220
on the way and there's going to be a lot of merchandise, although yes, of course, I

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:23.020
believe that both yes, Diablo, the game is not going to have pet food.

01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.300
Like that would be ridiculous.

01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:28.860
Um, but I think when it comes down to the more generic stuff, like, you know, shirts

01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.740
and stuff, it's, it's really going to have to be about that look and I'm not sure.

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:33.820
And this is part of why.

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:39.580
These sorts of laws need to be, um, updated and stuff is that we know Diablo

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.180
is Diablo when it's in a certain font and it's in red and, you know, looks all

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:45.020
Satan-y for lack of a better term.

01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:45.340
Right.

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.100
That's what we know Diablo.

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:49.740
Whereas I don't think Diablo, the dog is going to look anything like that.

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.980
So I don't know.

01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:55.980
Phoenix 77 26 is telling me this is a stretch Armstrong stretch.

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:56.940
Very stretchy.

01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:02.380
Well, um, uh, see a Tiberian chat says, YouTuber Patrick star is allowed to use

01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:06.300
the name Patrick star unless he's pretending to be a cartoon starfish.

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:07.780
That'd be annoying though.

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.220
Like if your, your name was trademarked and like, sorry, you can't use that.

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.900
It's like that happened with that one singer when, uh, the group lady and

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.580
Antebellum tried to change their name.

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:18.220
That's right.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:22.420
They, uh, lady a was supposed to be the new name and, uh, there was some artist

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:25.060
in the Seattle area, I believe that already used that name.

01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:25.660
That's right.

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:26.460
I remember that.

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:26.980
Yeah.

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:30.140
And they were trying to Sue the shit out of her for a name that's

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.220
already been hers for years.

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:31.740
Yeah.

01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:32.380
Yeah.

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:36.140
So they, did they ever settle that or did they have to change her name again?

01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:37.380
I don't know.

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:37.980
Yeah, I don't know.

01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:44.420
But I mean, the, the term Antebellum isn't, oh no, no.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:50.620
I just did association, but it's just means before the civil war.

01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:50.940
Yeah.

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:52.900
I understand why they changed it.

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:53.940
That's not, that's not the issue.

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:56.940
I just, you know, did they, did they end up having to change it again?

01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:59.660
Cause they couldn't use lady a yeah.

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:00.300
I don't know.

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:05.260
So they soured anything I could ever have thought positively of them with this.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:10.420
Um, the chicks didn't end up in the same situation though, despite the fact their

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:12.420
name is very vague, right?

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:15.380
No, I think they actually, from day one, they gave credit.

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.300
There was like an Australian group or something called that.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.540
And they kind of like gave credit to them right out the gate.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.460
And I think that's cooler.

01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:23.220
All right.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:24.580
Fair enough.

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:29.980
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's a dude named Mike Rowe who has a software

01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:35.220
company called Mike Rose soft and Microsoft tried to Sue and lost.

01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:36.460
I never knew about that.

01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:40.500
That's, that's an interesting Mike Rose soft.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:47.100
Uh, that sounds like that's more of like, they're trying to make a pun and I, I, I

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.980
could see it a little bit of problem there, but like, cause you don't just

01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.660
say, I don't know how, okay.

01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:58.020
I have to ask, how does Four Seasons Gardening Company get to exist?

01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:08.540
Because now the hotel can prove that there's confusion, maybe they just

01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:13.900
consider that that's like, well, most people would, idiots wouldn't think.

01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.460
What idiots going to confuse us with a gardening co.

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:18.860
All right.

01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:20.500
Uh, let's move on.

01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.300
Our last story tonight, a follow-up, uh, to something we had talked about

01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.900
previously, um, which is the Humble Bundle.

01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:32.020
And, uh, remember how we talked about that, uh, they were getting rid of those

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:32.700
sliders.

01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.900
You wouldn't be able to donate, uh, as much to charity anymore and all this.

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:37.420
Well, well, how about this?

01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.540
Uh, they've rethought their position.

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:44.780
I wonder why, I wonder if there was outrage on any internet platform, uh, that

01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:49.580
was looking like they, uh, were having to retreat on their position a little bit.

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:50.740
Uh, yes.

01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:54.860
Uh, Humble wrote a blog post and said, we've heard everyone loud and clear and

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:57.100
apologize for the way these changes were rolled out.

01:54:57.340 --> 01:55:01.500
We are now taking a moment to pause, collect constructive feedback and be more

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.460
transparent about the path forward.

01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:06.700
So long story short, the sliders are coming back.

01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:11.100
Um, what's interesting, and, uh, Bobby really broke this down on his show, so

01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.420
I'll, I'll give him a shout out if you want to get the exact numbers on a Bobby

01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:19.460
Blackwell show, but he was kind of going on about how, um, the sliders, you know,

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.980
they're a little bit hidden, but they always kind of, I guess have been, at

01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:26.940
least for the last several years, the default numbers they're at are very

01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.420
interesting.

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:35.980
It's something like 35% to Humble, 5% to charity, 60% to the developer, for a

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.660
game and on books, it's even crazier.

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:45.620
Um, and I guess the thought is, yes, they can bring the sliders back and it'll get,

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:50.220
keep them in people's good graces and all that stuff, but they must think that

01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:54.140
there's a lot of people that are not even going to bother to check the sliders and

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:57.940
just, you know, pay whatever and be on their way out the door without adjusting

01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:01.820
the sliders so that Humble can kind of intentionally take a bigger cut from the

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:03.620
way the defaults are designed now.

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:09.980
Um, which, um, is not terribly surprising and, and probably right in that thinking

01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:12.500
that there's going to be a lot of people who just click the buy button without

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:13.420
changing the sliders.

01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:19.420
Um, but at least there's an option now and you can, buyer beware and you can just,

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.900
you know, make the decision for yourself.

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:23.060
Now, you know, sliders are there, look for them.

01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.860
But, um, I thought that whole, the whole reversal is kind of interesting.

01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:33.300
Um, I, I am surprised though, actually, that they did reverse their position

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:37.260
because, uh, and you know, I think we talked about this when we, this story

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:42.380
first came up, but I think, uh, we figured that the Humble store was probably in a

01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:46.180
little bit of trouble and needed to do something to make some money fast.

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:50.740
Um, and so this unpopular decision, because the alternative is no more Humble

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:51.740
store at all.

01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:56.020
Um, and so they probably did this decision as a sort of a, this is how we can kind

01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.460
of save ourselves financially.

01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:05.100
Um, the fact that they've had to retreat and change this back could end up doing

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:05.580
the company.

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.660
Maybe, uh, we'll see.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.500
So, uh, I hope not.

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:14.580
Uh, I like that there's options out there, but, uh, we'll see what happens in the

01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.260
coming months.

01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:16.420
All right.

01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.900
Interesting followup tonight.

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:22.660
Let's get to the part of the show where we have our listener round table.

01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:26.900
So we're going to accept your questions through our chat room and of course the

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:31.060
mailbag and something else I'll get to in a minute here, but first let's see what

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.540
our email situation looks like.

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:37.340
Well, we go to participate at orange lounge radio.com and, uh, check out any

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.820
emails that may have come in this week.

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:39.780
I thought there was email.

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:40.820
I thought there was one.

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:41.460
Am I wrong?

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.180
No, maybe I, there is zero.

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:44.620
All right.

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:46.420
I guess I confused it with last week's pile.

01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.060
How about that?

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:50.820
Jack race talk, except I'm not really watching anything else.

01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.820
It's not on it's over.

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:56.260
Uh, I didn't watch any of the other, other, uh, locations.

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:56.580
Oh yeah.

01:57:56.580 --> 01:57:58.220
There's the Australia one is going on, right?

01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:00.060
Or down, excuse me, it's Australia and New Zealand.

01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:00.700
So it's down under.

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:05.700
So I I'm y'all as much as I love that show and I love a lot of people have been on it.

01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:06.540
It's, it's too much.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:11.460
It's just too fucking much at this point, like with all the different countries and

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.100
all this stuff.

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:16.780
So DJ Rama S is suggesting now it has to be dead by daylight talk.

01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:21.020
If you don't send emails, then Jamie and I have free license to talk about as much dead

01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:22.020
by daylight as we want.

01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:23.620
I do kind of like that idea.

01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:24.540
That's a very good idea.

01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.140
I will take that into consideration.

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:31.140
However, I mentioned that we would do something new here and I intend to follow

01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:37.460
through on that and that is that we are going to get some of your comments that you have

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:43.820
left throughout the week in our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:49.020
because a lot of you guys post tweets, you post stories, you post things that we haven't

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:50.900
always gotten around to on this show.

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:55.100
So I think we need to dedicate this listener round table or at least a portion of this

01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:55.500
to that.

01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:01.140
And the reality is you guys don't always ask a lot in chat and so I want to get questions

01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:02.660
and feedback from other places.

01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:07.140
So we'll talk about some of the stuff that's in our discord.

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.260
Although now, of course, the week I'm saying you guys don't usually ask a lot in chat.

01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:12.740
It's blown up.

01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:18.500
So, uh, Phoenix 77 26 is suggesting, how about dead by daylight versus drag race?

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:23.260
And DJ Rama S says this came up in conversation earlier with Phoenix 77 26 dead by

01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.740
daylight versus drag race.

01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:27.100
Well, it's funny you say that.

01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:31.060
Okay, let's let's take this conversation to a place you didn't expect.

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.900
So dark soccer, you watch a lot of dead by daylight on twitch.

01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:36.140
And I got into this last week.

01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:39.700
Like you, you have been probably a heavier participant in twitch than you've ever been.

01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:40.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:42.660
Which is great because you're also promoting the show.

01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:44.140
Well, yeah.

01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:47.700
And a few people have asked, you know, just when I mentioned to a podcast people have

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:52.860
asked, so I'll indulge because it's the one chance I get to actually talk about another

01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:54.220
stream and somebody else's stream.

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:57.220
Yeah, it's, it's usually perceived as tacky to do that.

01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:00.580
But if somebody opens the door and asks, then it's of course you're fine.

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:00.900
Right.

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:01.940
So, yeah.

02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:09.100
Um, so, uh, there's a lot of drag race alumnus that stream and they all stream dead by

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:14.700
daylight because again, it's, it's that LGBTQ culture kind of calls to this game.

02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:17.900
Uh, and, and now, and let's throw Dracula in as well.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:22.980
Cause I think like bitch Puddin, uh, from Dracula does like other stuff too.

02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:25.860
And I know it's done a lot of virtual drag shows, but I know she's played dead by

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.900
daylight on stream as well.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.620
But, um, on China has a stream and does a lot of dead by daylight.

02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:33.100
Although she does some artistic stuff, things with her husband as well.

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:38.020
Detox, uh, has been a more recent addition to Twitch has been streaming dead by daylight.

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:39.860
I want to say he came into a chat.

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.460
I was in Trixie watches some of the same people that dark soccer and I do.

02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:47.740
And I think she's done her own dead by daylight stream, but not very often.

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.660
Like once in a blue moon, you'll see her doing it.

02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:55.620
If I think, if I'm right, I think it was an LC losing colors stream, which I may chat VIP.

02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:57.620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:00.660
Well, uh, losing color is a great, uh, uh, dead by daylight streamer.

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:03.660
Shout out losing color, just kind of cool person.

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:06.620
I really enjoy Nick and Prince as far as, um, killers go.

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.340
And I think detox ended up rating him, uh, not that long ago.

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:12.060
Um, yeah, there's a lot of great personalities out there.

02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:18.220
So another of my favorites is, uh, uh, lopin, I guess it's NA at the end.

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:32.860
But another really, a really good one, but it's, it's the best thing has just been that it's bringing, I guess, the community better known and maybe middle known, I guess, together.

02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.780
Uh, and a lot of, um, non drag race drag streaming dead by daylight as well.

02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:42.100
London Bradshaw is one that comes to mind, who I think is really good.

02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:42.620
They're really good.

02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:44.620
Um, who, what deer?

02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:46.180
I think a lot of people know deer at this point.

02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:46.940
Evolution.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:48.180
Uh-huh.

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:48.620
Uh-huh.

02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:57.300
Oh, evolution has done some funny freaking videos, Sutton fister or something like that is her name does dead by daylight as well.

02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:57.940
Yeah, I think so.

02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:58.420
Yeah.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.260
There's a lot of, there's a lot of good talent on there.

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.020
So, um, yeah, anyway, so there you go.

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:03.860
There you go.

02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:08.740
Uh, there there's as requested by daylight cross drag race talk.

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:12.380
Loki's sitting there going, I didn't request this.

02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.140
I did not request this.

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:20.140
Also noticed in my background there that, uh, this, so this is earth defense force world heroes.

02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:25.500
It's that like 3d.game heroes meets earth defense force and the character just dabbed on the windscreen.

02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:26.980
I don't know what the feel about that.

02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:28.100
So, okay, we'll see.

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:32.300
Bonds, double six chat says, Rob said dead by daylight versus drag race.

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.500
And my girlfriend was like, who's making that?

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:35.580
Cause I want it now.

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.500
All right, let's indulge one more, one more.

02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:44.660
Dead by daylight announces a new RuPaul's drag race pack.

02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:49.900
Who is the killer and who is the survivor in a RuPaul's drag race?

02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:51.140
Dead by daylight pack.

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:53.260
Who is the killer and who is the survivor?

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:54.100
Loki, what would you say?

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.380
No, I have no idea who anybody is on that show.

02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:00.620
Of course, our survivor, you know, who it would be?

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:01.100
Who?

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:03.100
The one who always comes back.

02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:04.260
Hallelu.

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:05.700
Oh, Shangela.

02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:06.300
Okay.

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:07.140
Shangela.

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:17.860
And then the enemy, the killer would be Roxy Andrews.

02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.580
And she's here to make it clear.

02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:23.980
Yeah, no, no, no.

02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:28.340
It would be, what's her face, um, from the one who's been causing

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.140
all that shit on from season one.

02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.580
Oh, Tammy Brown or not Tammy Brown.

02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:35.140
No.

02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:39.860
Um, Chanel?

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:44.420
No, the one who was, like, threatening the bomb drag con and all that.

02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:46.420
Oh, that was season two, Tyra Sanchez.

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:47.820
Yeah, Tyra Sanchez.

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.220
Oh, that's okay.

02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:49.580
Okay.

02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:50.140
All right.

02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:53.940
There's so many people in chat that are like, I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:54.900
Okay, I'll wrap this up.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:57.100
Look, hey, look, y'all brought it up in chat.

02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:00.660
This segment is for Bonds006's girlfriend only.

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:03.700
Everyone else fast forward.

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:04.140
Okay.

02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:09.300
Uh, then I would say so for the, for the killer and the survivor.

02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.780
Oh, this is such a tough one.

02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.580
The killer would be the producers.

02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:21.100
Um, the, oh, light profusion suggests Katya is a killer.

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.060
That's a really good one.

02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:29.180
Um, by the way, I don't shout out a lot of the like celebrity podcasts very often, but I am going to say.

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.660
The Bald and the Beautiful, um, Katya and Trixie's podcast.

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:38.860
They just did an episode with Katya and her mom and the mom is, it's not actually her mom.

02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:39.700
Spoiler alert.

02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:45.100
And if you know, if you know your comedians, you will recognize her voice in the first five seconds.

02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:49.100
It is the Tracy Elman, Julie Tanuta, Devin Green.

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:50.220
Oh, okay.

02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:52.700
Welcome to my home.

02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:58.820
It's her and it's the, it's the funniest fucking thing I've heard in a very long time.

02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:00.740
So just shout out for that.

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.460
I will say that.

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:05.780
So yeah, I, y'all, I'm thinking Katya is the killer.

02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:07.700
I think light profusion might be onto something.

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:12.220
I think I just would see it except she, she'd be a flop killer.

02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:16.140
And that's okay.

02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:18.140
She'd be like, oh, they got out the gate.

02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:21.620
Oh, well, I'll just do some splits.

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:23.020
Uh, so I like that.

02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:26.020
Um, let's see who would the survivor be though?

02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.700
Like now that Shangela answer was too fucking good.

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:31.380
I'm going to say Naomi Smalls, who I'm also seeing in chat.

02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:35.940
Cause Naomi's got legs like, like Naomi Smalls would have sprint burst too.

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.620
So there you go.

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.140
All right.

02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:39.860
Enough.

02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:42.380
I promise new stuff.

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:42.740
All right.

02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:48.580
Let's get to the discord where you guys have been posting some things throughout the week, uh, including tiger claw.

02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:56.540
Wanted to point out that there is a, some eighties action heroes that are coming to call of duty, including Rambo and John McClane from dead hard.

02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:57.540
So guess what?

02:05:57.580 --> 02:05:58.380
Dead by daylight.

02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:01.740
Isn't the only one that gets licensed stuff to try to sweeten up their game.

02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:04.220
But apparently, uh, this is happening as well.

02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:09.540
These are movie skins that tie in with the 1984 Verdansk map in the game.

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:10.900
So there's that.

02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:12.340
Hmm.

02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:14.620
Uh, let's see some other comments.

02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:18.260
SSJ 100, Matt thought this was right up dark soccer's alley.

02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:19.420
So let's see.

02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:24.780
It is a Digimon interactive fitness tracker, a vital bracelet, digital monster.

02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.620
It's now available for pre-order.

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.860
Uh, and it is a 65 or $75.

02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:35.420
I don't know what the difference is, but it looks like it's a little bracelet, like a Fitbit, but it actually has a Digimon that's like on it.

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.140
Like almost like a Tamagotchi or something.

02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:41.620
So did I say dead hard?

02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:43.300
Like I was still thinking dead by daylight.

02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:45.860
I meant, I meant die hard.

02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:46.340
Sorry.

02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:52.620
Like I'm like, what the chat is going like, you said dead hard, dead hard is an ability in dead by daylight.

02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:52.940
Sorry.

02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:53.980
All right.

02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:55.740
Um, let's see.

02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:06.420
Oh, Tiger Claw had also pointed out that the, uh, voice actress and motion capture for the infamous Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil 8 has unveiled who she is.

02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:21.140
It is Maggie Robertson, who you can find on Twitter at Maggie the Bard, who said in a tweet, so we finally meet thrilled to finally announce I was the voiceover and performance capture artist behind our beloved Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village.

02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:26.580
Such an honor to be a part of this video game and bring this, ahem, huge character to life.

02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:34.060
Well, I feel bad for the replies or it's going to be just a mess.

02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:40.860
Her convention rate just doubled knowing that she's Lady Dimitrescu.

02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:42.780
I mean, she can ask for more money and get it.

02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:49.300
Uh, Phoenix7726 is wondering because there is a diehard skin in Call of Duty, is Call of Duty now a Christmas game?

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:51.460
Always has been, right?

02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:52.180
Always has been.

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:59.100
Well, he had a Christmas map in Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, the first one, like the old Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.

02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:05.340
They had a Christmas map, um, that every skin of a map that they did it, that was a Christmas one.

02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:09.900
So technically it's always been Christmas game.

02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:21.460
Dungeon Buster sharing an interesting article from PCGamesN.com about after nine years, a judge has thrown out a World of Warcraft patent lawsuit.

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:28.860
A court granted Activision's request for the World's Inc. claim of patent infringement to be declared invalid.

02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:38.460
So what happened, Worlds was essentially claiming to have invented the idea of 3D multiplayer in which a server would filter the number of users visible to any particular player

02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:41.260
without getting specific about how it wanted to accomplish that.

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:47.460
Blizzard in court said that this isn't an idea you can own a patent for, and nine years later, a judge agrees.

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:50.660
That's how long some of these things take to settle, just so you know.

02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:51.100
For sure.

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:51.620
Yeah.

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:52.660
All right.

02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.260
Um, let's see some other comments here.

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:59.580
Some of these stories we actually talked about a little bit earlier, and I don't want to read everything.

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:03.380
Um, did we talk about the Stadia thing?

02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:05.100
I thought for sure I show-rolled that.

02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:06.500
No, don't.

02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:07.380
What Stadia thing?

02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:11.060
Uh, that six more Google Stadia staff members left the company.

02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:12.540
Uh, general manager.

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:13.620
The measurements company.

02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:13.860
Yeah.

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:14.340
Yeah.

02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.820
General manager, head of creative services and more.

02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:19.540
Uh, they've all left to join Haven studio at Sony.

02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:24.300
Kind of an interesting wheelchair that was shared by Tiger Claw in a quick little tweet there.

02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:25.380
So there's that.

02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:26.940
Interesting.

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:28.420
So, um,

02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:29.860
I've got a last minute.

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:30.860
Sorry, if you want to do that.

02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:31.980
Yes, please.

02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:40.460
So, uh, one game that's supposed to be out sometime this year, but we don't know when though is Psychonauts 2.

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:41.540
Well,

02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:47.620
somehow the Xbox app is allowing folks to preload the game.

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:56.300
So it's about 27 gigabytes and it's being preloaded, but we still don't know when it's coming out.

02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.340
I imagine soon then if that's the case.

02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:00.620
I must be soon.

02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:03.660
It will be a hackers will get in there first if they don't watch it.

02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:05.580
Yeah.

02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:08.700
Any other last minute stories?

02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:10.620
No, that was all I had.

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:16.500
Well, that was all the shout outs I had from, uh, act deaf to suggesting E3 surprise release, perhaps.

02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:18.620
Probably a surprise in quotes.

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.820
Now it got leaked to like most E3 things do.

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:21.540
So there you go.

02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:27.980
Um, so anyway, I do want to give a shout out one more time for our discord vog network.com slash discord.

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:30.980
And for all the stories you guys leave in there throughout the week, keep it coming.

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:33.900
So, um, I, I found a good place to kind of fit that in the show now.

02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:34.580
So there you go.

02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:37.700
We'll, we'll be sure to read more of those, um, in the future.

02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:42.060
Um, but with that, I think we're down towards the end of the show.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.580
If there's no more last minute stories, I think it's time to get final thoughts.

02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.300
Um, before we get to final thoughts, I do.

02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:54.660
And of course, thank everybody out there for listening, whether you were listening live here on Sunday night at twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:10:54.900 --> 02:11:03.020
Or if you were listening to the podcast feed throughout the week, whether it was on Spotify or iTunes or wherever it is, uh, that you choose to listen to podcasts.

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.940
Thank you for making orange launch radio part of your week.

02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:06.260
Uh, really appreciate it.

02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.820
Uh, give, give us a holler on Twitter at OLR.

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:10.140
Say hello, let us know you're out there.

02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:11.100
Emails.

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:16.580
We need more of them, uh, or, or we'll, we'll continue this dead by daylight fan, uh, dry grace fantasy next week.

02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:26.660
Uh, I just, I almost said, um, my, uh, vanilla mocha fantasy or whatever it was that, uh, Valentina thought about or talked about.

02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.820
And now I'm like, Valentina would be a great killer.

02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.340
Don't you think?

02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:31.100
Hmm.

02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:36.340
Anyway, so it's dead by drag races, dead by drag race, drag by daylight.

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:38.460
I think might actually be from a pod culture.

02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.140
Pod culture and chat is a good one.

02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:40.460
Anyway.

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:41.100
All right.

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:41.860
Uh, so there you go.

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.420
Participate at orange launch radio.com.

02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:48.940
If you want to send us an email, um, you guys don't have to, um, give money for the show.

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:50.260
We'll continue to do it for free.

02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:56.260
I just want to appreciate and acknowledge those of you that have subscribed here at VOG network and donated biddies, um, throughout the night.

02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:00.820
I will read all of you a little bit later after the credits and give you some personalized thanks.

02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.900
Um, but I will also say that, uh, the shop, uh, as well, if you feel so inclined to vog network.com slash shop.

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:10.980
Um, and then, uh, of course, um, just thank you.

02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.260
Word of mouth goes a long way.

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:20.700
Uh, tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then, uh, you know, so, uh, get your friends to listen.

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:24.180
A host here at Twitch probably does more than anything.

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:27.380
Even if you don't stream that much yourself, you probably have your friends following you.

02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:30.340
So a host will go a long, long way.

02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:34.260
So I thank you to all of you that host vog network on your own Twitch feeds.

02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:34.940
Okay.

02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:36.180
I think we can wrap up.

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:36.740
That's it.

02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.180
Well, don't forget.

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:43.060
After, after the show, um, stay, uh, stay tuned.

02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:49.020
Um, because outcomes, my, uh, my new segment sounds good.

02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:52.460
And for those that are on the podcast feed and they're like, Oh shit, I missed it.

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:59.260
Um, your archives on your personal channel, dark SACRA underscore O L R are open.

02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:01.580
So if somebody wants to watch it after the fact, they can.

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:03.180
Indeed.

02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:03.660
Yes.

02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:06.300
So just, just for the podcast, these don't get to see it live.

02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:09.300
Um, so let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.740
So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.

02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:11.540
Your final thought tonight.

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:17.380
My final thought is going to be working more on Minecraft and, uh, Oh, I, I don't

02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:18.540
know if I talked about that.

02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:21.860
I don't remember if I talked about the labels that got, um, so I did get my

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.500
labels finally for pixel poops.

02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:28.980
Number two, they were all jacked up, so I don't know what the ha what happened, but

02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:33.700
somewhere in the shipping or something, they shrunk, but they didn't shrink in a

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:38.460
uniform, they, they shrunk and it looked like someone had taken the label off and

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.780
put it back on and they were really shrunk and distorted.

02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:45.900
And so I got the back follow up with the next week because I haven't heard back

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:48.940
from since like Tuesday, because they were supposed to be resolving the issue,

02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:50.420
but yeah, they were all jacked up.

02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:52.460
So yeah, it's unfortunate.

02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:53.740
They look cool though.

02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:55.220
All right.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:59.780
My final thought is a very vague, uh, big changes are coming in a few months.

02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:04.580
And, uh, I, to, to quote, uh, a famous monologue, I'm so excited.

02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:05.300
I'm so excited.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.020
I'm so scared.

02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:06.980
All right.

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:10.220
Uh, dark, dark soccer, your final thought.

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:16.580
Um, I should probably make my tiramisu and I'm really afraid I'm

02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:17.780
going to play very badly tonight.

02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:19.420
You know what?

02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:20.460
It's about having fun.

02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:23.940
You don't have to, the thing about a lot of these, uh, folks we've been

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.300
shouting out on a Twitch, yes, they're good, but they didn't, they weren't

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:29.340
good overnight took them a long time to get good.

02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:32.100
So, all right, keep working on it.

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:32.740
All right.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.220
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.900
I cannot believe I didn't say this anywhere in the show.

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:42.580
Uh, I'm very sorry about that, but I hope all of our mothers out there, our gaming

02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:44.940
mommies had a very happy mother's day.

02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:51.100
And if you are somebody who, uh, um, you're just a mother figure, a pet mom

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:54.580
or something like that, whatever the case may be a happy mother's day to you.

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:57.980
Uh, and all our gaming moms out there, uh, at orange lounge radio.

02:14:58.220 --> 02:14:59.460
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:00.660
We'll see you in seven days.

02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:01.540
Good night.

02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:05.420
