00:00.000 --> 00:13.520
While I was skimming the news tonight, none of the articles really jumped out at me. New

00:13.520 --> 00:17.840
consoles, new games, retro consoles, retro games, fan mods, mashups, etc. I realized

00:17.840 --> 00:21.100
that this was the news. That we are smack in the middle of the transitionary period

00:21.100 --> 00:24.720
where the gaming world moves around between the big earth-shattering announcements. It's

00:24.720 --> 00:28.000
that very pleasant middle ground of news that is all good, but without yours truly having

00:28.000 --> 00:31.280
to skirt around the most obvious thing to reference. This is the meta intro, now it's

00:31.280 --> 00:35.360
time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about actual news. Starting

00:35.360 --> 00:37.200
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.960 --> 00:46.400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.400 --> 00:52.960
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again today,

00:52.960 --> 01:01.280
May the 23rd of 2021 with episode number 870 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining

01:01.280 --> 01:07.440
you here live on Twitch TV at channel VOG Network where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

01:07.440 --> 01:12.320
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I am joined by, of course,

01:12.320 --> 01:14.560
the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.080
Hello.

01:16.080 --> 01:16.800
How are you doing?

01:18.320 --> 01:20.240
I am well rested.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.280
Good. Yes. We were talking a little bit about that before the show.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.520
Yeah. I'm also not used to having like this extra light now. It's kind of getting in my eyes.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.120
Yes. But I love the lighting looks great where you're at. It's good.

01:33.120 --> 01:42.160
Thanks. Well, I invested in a new ring light. Thank goodness for TJ Maxx and the fact that

01:42.160 --> 01:49.040
they've got like 50,000 different ring lights for anywhere between like 12 to 40 bucks.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.800
Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad, but.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.960
No, I'm going to say it because I want my fellow indies out there to be able to afford some good

01:56.960 --> 01:57.680
ass lighting.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.440
Well, and I've noticed in general that a lot of stores out there are starting to kind of cater to

02:03.440 --> 02:09.520
this streaming broadcasting culture. You know, I go into Best Buy and I'm looking for, I think

02:09.520 --> 02:13.840
I was looking for a microphone or something. And there's this whole little section about like

02:13.840 --> 02:18.800
influencers and they have microphones for influencers and cameras and the lighting and

02:18.800 --> 02:23.920
that stuff. It's like a big thing. And it's, you know, obviously we've been doing this a very long

02:23.920 --> 02:28.800
time coming up on 19 years next month. And so it does make me do this double take about.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.600
This is stuff like now they sell it a Best Buy. This used to be the stuff that like you had to

02:33.600 --> 02:38.720
be a total geek and go to Radio Shack to get. I could hear the Travis Donovan, our dear friend

02:38.720 --> 02:44.000
from Understation Life. I could hear his old man rant building in my head about you kids today.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.720
Oh, I mean, it took me, it only took me 18 years to upgrade to a good mic, so whatever.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.000
Same here at OLR. Going to chat.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.920
I can't go back from using this sucker.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.040
Oh, we'll figure it out. In chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network,

03:01.040 --> 03:08.080
Act Def says street vendors in Mexico sell LED lights and cans now. That's fascinating.

03:08.080 --> 03:14.320
You know, I think I've seen like the clips for phones. I've seen like the selfie lights.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.320
I've seen those at street vendors and I see a lot of like the color LED lights,

03:18.320 --> 03:21.280
like like sports fans waving them around a stadium, things like that.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.320
But like to the extent that you're talking about for like influences, it's just

03:26.880 --> 03:32.000
it's fascinating. We're in that type of culture. All right. Well, let's see if our other old man

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
here at Orange Launch Radio has a has a rant or two about it. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.160
What's a Radio Shack?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.200
This story. You've been to a Radio Shack, Loki.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.000
Give me a break. I'm sure you miss it, too. Come on.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.520
Are you a geriatric millennial?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.040
Is that a contradiction?

03:51.920 --> 03:52.480
Ask Rob.

03:53.120 --> 03:59.280
That's a yes. It's my one viral tweet. Well, look, Radio Shack was a store that was open

03:59.280 --> 04:03.920
back in the day that that game that's playing behind you tonight was popular.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.840
Actually, I don't think that game was ever popular. It was just kind of like a cult game

04:07.840 --> 04:14.160
that people do, because it's but it was featured in, you know, a feature length movie.

04:14.160 --> 04:14.720
That's true.

04:16.800 --> 04:22.000
And it was used as the theme music for a Strong Bad segment.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.120
And it was so rad, of course, for the podcast listeners who can't see it.

04:25.120 --> 04:32.720
He's got Rad Racer, the eight bit classic on the NES with its 3D mode playing behind him right now.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.200
Actually, it's not in 3D right now, though. It's it is that horrible red and blue thing

04:37.200 --> 04:42.160
when you have it in 3D. But it worked. I don't think it's in 3D mode right now.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.720
No, it's not. It's not. It looked when you hit. I think you hit the select button to toggle it

04:46.720 --> 04:52.080
back in the day. And it's like it takes away everything. And it's just like red and blue lines.

04:52.080 --> 04:57.520
And it's it's not that great, because all you see is like a little added depth. And of course,

04:57.520 --> 05:02.240
the old school 80s glasses that kind of would give you a headache after not that long. You know,

05:02.720 --> 05:07.360
it wasn't great technology. We've come a long way in our 3D technology, that's for sure.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.920
But yeah, it was, you know, that's how everybody knew Rad Racer. A lot of people forget it was a

05:13.920 --> 05:19.040
Square well, now Square Enix, but Square game, because most people only know them through the

05:19.040 --> 05:25.440
role playing games. Yeah, so I don't know. I thought it'd be a fun game to put back there.

05:25.440 --> 05:31.680
Yeah, it is. Orange Right in chat says it's that game from the wizard. It's so bad. Yes,

05:31.760 --> 05:37.120
yes, it is. All right, um, we're gonna get in. Yeah, what can I interject something really off

05:37.120 --> 05:45.840
topic right now? I suppose Lady Gaga got the keys to West Hollywood today. She didn't already have

05:45.840 --> 05:51.760
them. Like I thought and all I can care about are those platform boots she has because I want them.

05:52.320 --> 05:58.400
Like, if gay rights were a Starbucks card, Lady Gaga would have like 1500 still waiting to be

05:58.400 --> 06:03.120
spent on her account. Like, she just now got the keys to West Hollywood. Really?

06:04.080 --> 06:08.960
I just like didn't realize that West Hollywood actually was considered a city that had a key.

06:08.960 --> 06:16.080
Yeah. All right. Okay, well, speaking of off topic random things, I will say a happy I doubt

06:16.080 --> 06:20.880
he's listening, but I'll say happy birthday anyway to Shad Starzik or Shane. His birthday,

06:20.880 --> 06:25.200
it's actually today. So it's not it's not like, you know, oh, it was Tuesday or something. It's

06:25.200 --> 06:31.360
actually today. Bringing him up also makes me think of this. This isn't technically our kickoff

06:31.360 --> 06:35.920
tonight, but too bad. I'm gonna talk about this anyway. It is gaming. He texted me something

06:36.560 --> 06:42.160
earlier this week because he reads he reads a lot of those web forums like reset era and that stuff.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.800
I think, Loki, you're in tune to a lot of that stuff, too. I don't really I don't I see this

06:46.800 --> 06:52.560
stuff on Twitter, but I don't see like a lot of the forums and that stuff. But he sent me something

06:52.560 --> 06:57.520
that was posted on one of those forums, which was like arcade one up leaks that are coming up.

06:58.880 --> 07:05.680
And yeah, I saw that. And apparently the person that leaked it is kind of like a YouTuber that's

07:05.680 --> 07:11.440
kind of known for this stuff. So it's not like out of the blue rando. My uncle works at arcade

07:11.440 --> 07:16.960
one up type of thing like this is. So anyway, long story short, it looks like a Tron machine

07:16.960 --> 07:22.960
is coming from arcade one up. It's going to have Tron and discs of Tron. And I absolutely had my

07:22.960 --> 07:28.480
God damn it moment. And I think we've talked about this on the show before. There's that thing. And

07:28.480 --> 07:32.960
when you see it, you just know you're not going to. It's just you see it. You'll God damn it. And

07:32.960 --> 07:37.600
it's the sound of your wallet just unloading. And that, you know, and I've said it on the show,

07:37.600 --> 07:42.640
I don't have room. I don't have money for another one of those arcade one up machines. But God damn

07:42.640 --> 07:47.840
it, I'm getting the Tron machine. I'm getting it. I have to, assuming it's legit and confirmed and

07:47.840 --> 07:55.120
all that stuff. And there's there was other ones, too, that there was a Simpsons machine

07:55.120 --> 08:00.240
that was in there, too. And I'm I'm sure that one is going to actually be really because people

08:00.800 --> 08:05.120
really fondly remember that Simpsons arcade game. We're talking about this a little bit on Bobby

08:05.120 --> 08:10.960
Blackwell's show because he's on live before us. And a very interesting connection I didn't realize

08:10.960 --> 08:14.880
because somebody in chat during his show has said, oh, I don't know if it's going to be real because

08:14.880 --> 08:19.280
Disney is not going to let Tron go. And we actually were kind of like, well, actually,

08:19.280 --> 08:24.720
Disney owns Star Wars and Star Wars has already had some arcade one up cabinets. And then that

08:24.720 --> 08:30.800
was kind of like the aha moment of right. Disney owns The Simpsons now, too. I forgot that. But

08:30.800 --> 08:34.880
that's why all the Simpsons stuff is on Disney Plus and of course, with the Fox and all that.

08:34.880 --> 08:40.160
So The Simpsons and Tron have that in common. There's a Disney connection there.

08:40.160 --> 08:50.640
So I will find the Disney connection. I don't know. Like I, I know when I saw the

08:50.640 --> 08:56.160
Paw Patrol cabinet, I was like, I was going to say that's that's one, too. I get that.

08:56.160 --> 09:02.080
We never we never had a Muppets cabinet, did we? Because Jamie breaking in a song.

09:02.080 --> 09:07.600
I don't think there was ever a Muppets like game. Well, I think there were like console games

09:07.600 --> 09:13.120
that weren't very good. And I think there were some edutainment Kermit games. And if you want

09:13.120 --> 09:17.200
to kind of tie that to Sesame Street, I think that certainly Sesame Street's had its share.

09:17.840 --> 09:23.680
But the Muppets, the Muppets. I want to say there was like an adventure game on Commodore 64,

09:24.320 --> 09:29.840
you know, because I would have an arcade cabinet. Yeah, nothing arcadey that I can think of. So

09:30.560 --> 09:36.240
there's that. Oh, SSG-100 Matt with the clip. Thank you for that. That reminds me,

09:36.240 --> 09:41.200
OK, I remember when the God damn it moment was it was something that happened with Jamie.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.200
And it was also an arcade one up story because we were talking about the Capcom cabinet

09:45.200 --> 09:48.080
and it had Strider in it. And Jamie went, God damn it.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.560
I'm I'm apparently a meme now. Had a God damn it moment. All right.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.800
Act Dev says, I think there's Muppet games on the Wii. Well, we had everything. Give me a break.

10:00.800 --> 10:06.320
All right. Anyway, so there's there's that little rumor. And I'm like, I'm very excited about the

10:06.320 --> 10:11.120
Tron cabinet at the same time. I'm very pissed off about it. I'm sure you can understand. Like,

10:11.120 --> 10:15.440
why did it have to be now? All right. Well, speaking of classics. Well, and you're going

10:15.440 --> 10:23.360
to have room for it, so. Well, in the future, I might, but nothing as of yet. So. All right.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.960
But you know what? You know what? You know what? You know what? You have a friend that you can

10:27.040 --> 10:32.640
store that at. I see what you're getting at. Who still has no room.

10:34.320 --> 10:41.760
All right. Anyway, speaking of classics, let's get into some talk about Nintendo Switch online

10:42.320 --> 10:47.200
and the classics library that's on the Nintendo Switch, because that is, of course, something

10:47.200 --> 10:52.320
that's continuing to grow. And they just made some big announcements this week that more games are

10:52.320 --> 10:57.040
going to be added, including Joe and Mac, which, for whatever reason, was called Caveman Ninja

10:57.040 --> 11:04.240
here, which is on this. Yeah. Yeah. I always saw it as Joe and Mac. No way. It's the other way

11:04.240 --> 11:09.520
around. It's Joe and Mac here and Caveman Ninja overseas, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I got it backwards.

11:09.520 --> 11:18.000
Sorry. But anyway, that is going to be one of the games that's coming. Magical Drop 2, which I

11:18.000 --> 11:25.120
forgot was even on Super Nintendo, is coming as well. And Ninja Zaya Marukun is coming out as well.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.120
And then there's some differences between Japan and the US. Japan is getting a Fire Emblem game,

11:31.120 --> 11:36.720
Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War. They don't want to translate that for the US or when they do,

11:36.720 --> 11:43.840
they'll charge us more money for it. And then Spanky's Quest, as well as Super Baseball Simulator

11:43.840 --> 11:51.680
1-0-0-0 are additional games that are coming for us here in the US. Now, the reason why I

11:51.680 --> 11:56.960
kind of bring this up at the top of the show tonight is because this means that the Nintendo

11:56.960 --> 12:04.160
Switch Online library has crossed 100 games. It's kind of hit a milestone. Obviously, people still

12:04.160 --> 12:08.640
have their criticisms of Nintendo Switch Online. I think we've all been a little bit critical here

12:08.640 --> 12:14.880
on OLR about it because we feel like there's still a lot of stuff missing from it. How do

12:14.880 --> 12:19.760
you feel about how far Nintendo Switch Online has come? And what do you think is kind of like

12:19.760 --> 12:27.040
missing that still needs to be added? Let me just go ahead and say Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger,

12:27.040 --> 12:31.920
Earthbound, The Guardian Legend. All right. I think I've named all the big ones. Outside of

12:31.920 --> 12:36.720
that, the ones we all know about. What are some things that are kind of like missing? Do you

12:36.720 --> 12:43.120
think this whole Switch Online, Super Nintendo, Nintendo library, do you think it is making a

12:43.120 --> 12:48.640
good deal for having a Nintendo Online membership? Or is Nintendo not doing enough still? Or like,

12:48.640 --> 12:53.520
where's your head at with all this now that we're so far into it and 100 games into it? Loki,

12:53.520 --> 12:56.640
I got to start with you because I know you're going to have something to say about Nintendo.

12:57.280 --> 13:02.400
I think that 100 games by now is not really enough. They could be doing so much more with

13:02.400 --> 13:07.440
that. I'm just having a hard time believing with the catalog that they had before that they

13:08.720 --> 13:14.720
just can't get those on there or like workout licensing deals with these guys. And not even

13:14.720 --> 13:19.200
necessarily licensing deals. I mean, they have their own like first party tiles, not everything's

13:19.200 --> 13:26.240
on there. So I just think there's so much more they could be doing. Dar Sakura, any opinion?

13:27.200 --> 13:30.800
I honestly just think that they're being cautious with the rollout. I mean,

13:30.800 --> 13:37.120
there's certainly games that I would like to see. Like, I don't recall if I saw Kirby's

13:37.120 --> 13:41.600
Avalanche on there, which is like my, that was my Puyo Puyo introduction.

13:41.600 --> 13:48.080
I think they just straight, they just have Puyo Puyo in it. They even put that in the US

13:48.080 --> 13:55.760
version. So I don't know if they put the Kirby branded one in there. He got the six in one game

13:55.760 --> 14:00.640
in the Super Nintendo era with the Kirby Superstar or whatever it was called. And the

14:00.640 --> 14:08.880
mini golf game is there too. But there's a bunch of other just like really kind of quirky games

14:08.880 --> 14:14.880
that I think would be well to come out. I mean, I've certainly covered a few. Like,

14:14.880 --> 14:21.280
I would like to have some more shooter games. You know, if they're going to get some other

14:21.280 --> 14:30.000
third party games, why don't we get something like UN Squadron or, what was the other stuff

14:30.000 --> 14:34.800
I played? Or back in the Nintendo ones like SkyShark, you know, get some of those

14:35.680 --> 14:38.080
cutaway games and a little bit more of the compile stuff.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.240
Good call out. I think, you know, obviously there's the big ones that I named that are

14:44.240 --> 14:48.560
still missing. I think for a lot of people, whether it's licensing or concern about the

14:48.560 --> 14:54.240
lines of Parody and Earthbound or whatever it is, obviously those are glaring omissions

14:54.240 --> 14:58.240
that continue to kind of spotlight what's missing and have a lot of the fandoms kind

14:58.240 --> 15:03.280
of like focused on that a little bit. I don't know if Super Mario RPG will ever happen. Although,

15:03.280 --> 15:08.720
why shouldn't it? Like what does Square have to lose from an agreement like that? There's a lot

15:08.720 --> 15:13.040
I kind of don't understand with that, but whatever. I'm not on the business side of things. So it's

15:13.040 --> 15:18.480
hard for me to say. What is still missing for me that kind of blows my mind that Nintendo still has

15:19.360 --> 15:25.840
capitalized on this is the other systems. Like, you know, if the Switch is meant to be like a

15:25.840 --> 15:33.840
portable system and a system that sits on the dock on played on the TV and 64. Well, there's that.

15:33.840 --> 15:38.560
But I'm also more thinking, where's Game Boy and Game Boy Advance and Color Game Boy? Where's like

15:38.560 --> 15:43.840
Pokemon Pinball? Where's, you know, the Mario game that was on Game Boy? Where's, you know,

15:43.840 --> 15:51.280
the Zelda? Does the Switch have one? I think it does. Yeah. Okay. So then, yeah, that would be

15:51.280 --> 15:59.360
easy. Yeah. So yeah, I don't understand why these don't exist in the library yet. Like the Game Boy

15:59.360 --> 16:04.400
stuff is long since overdue and I hope Nintendo is going to think about making an announcement.

16:04.400 --> 16:10.560
And I would agree that Nintendo 64 also pretty long overdue at this point. Especially, you know,

16:10.560 --> 16:14.880
to revisit classics like Pokemon Snap. Although yes, I'm sure Nintendo would rather you play the

16:14.880 --> 16:19.680
new one, but there's going to come a time when the new one isn't selling like crazy anymore.

16:19.680 --> 16:24.880
And revisiting the old school Pokemon Snap would be a delight, but maybe they're also noticing

16:24.880 --> 16:30.480
people are willing. I mean, they could have given away Mario 64 for free, but why should they when

16:30.480 --> 16:37.280
they did that Mario 3D All-Star collection limited time and charge 20 bucks for it? If it's 60 divided

16:37.280 --> 16:42.320
by three, 20 bucks for it, and people still paid it. And so that kind of goes in line with what

16:42.320 --> 16:48.160
Bobby is saying in chat. Bobby Blackwolf says, Square realized people will pay for their old ROMs.

16:48.160 --> 16:53.600
And I think that's kind of like this tricky place we're at with Nintendo online is now it's like,

16:53.600 --> 16:59.120
okay, so some games you'll give away with the membership, but others you're so protective of,

16:59.120 --> 17:04.800
you're going to sell them in a bundle or whatever, or do a $5 standalone, which I think ultimately

17:04.800 --> 17:08.720
is what happens with Earthbound. I think Earthbound will be released, but you're going to

17:08.720 --> 17:12.640
have to pay money for it outside of the Switch online collection. And they're going to do

17:12.640 --> 17:20.160
something stupid to justify why it's a separate cost. Like, oh, it's a special anniversary edition

17:20.160 --> 17:27.360
with some extra art in this menu shell that we put with it and a digital version of the instruction

17:27.360 --> 17:33.680
manual. And we're going to have GameStop sell a $50 version of Earthbound that comes with a little

17:33.680 --> 17:41.840
statue. Like, I can, I can hear Loki rolling his eyes. But you don't have to hear it in person.

17:43.760 --> 17:49.040
Is it isn't this literally their mo like, is anything I'm saying then don't make an effort

17:49.040 --> 17:54.000
then then there's I get it that they want to do that with some other titles. But like, if that's

17:54.000 --> 17:58.720
the case, then why don't we see a lot of these titles being? I mean, we see some of them being

17:58.720 --> 18:03.760
released on these platforms as like collections and stuff, but not everything. So there's still

18:03.760 --> 18:07.760
plenty of content that they can be putting on there and other systems that they can be adding

18:07.760 --> 18:11.840
on it. And like I said, you know, Nintendo first party could do some stuff as well. Obviously,

18:11.840 --> 18:15.200
we're not gonna see some Pokemon games getting added on there because they're gonna remake all

18:15.200 --> 18:20.720
those. But like, then why even put forth the effort because that's your selling point. You're

18:20.720 --> 18:25.600
like, okay, Nintendo online, you have online access, which kind of sucks. And then you have

18:25.600 --> 18:31.280
access to the this library of games, but we're just not going to contribute to it because it,

18:31.280 --> 18:38.000
you know, it's gonna grow over our other plans to screw you over by selling the piecemeal to you

18:38.000 --> 18:45.600
like, it's not a plan to screw over. And it's the point of a business to be greedy and of store

18:45.600 --> 18:51.120
but it's it's why it's why we all hate capitalism. Yes. I understand that. But then don't offer that

18:51.120 --> 18:55.200
then don't even offer the games at all. And if that's that's going to be the issue if you're

18:55.360 --> 18:59.200
gonna just sell these all piecemeal, then just don't do it. Because right now it's just like,

18:59.200 --> 19:01.760
I don't even know why we cover this every time they put games out on it. Like,

19:02.800 --> 19:07.680
wow. Good business for them. They're three years, you know, 100 games. Good job. Good job,

19:07.680 --> 19:11.920
you guys. That's way more than you ever had in your virtual console stores.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.920
They're putting out enough to make Nintendo online attractive to the average user.

19:16.880 --> 19:22.400
And they're putting them out as they see this is not going to be profitable to have standalone,

19:22.400 --> 19:27.440
let's put it in with the service to again, make it attractive for people to want Nintendo online

19:27.440 --> 19:32.320
beyond just a few games. And then the big games, the ones that they know that they're going to be

19:32.320 --> 19:38.400
able to compile and have as a standalone, something that would bring in more revenue

19:38.400 --> 19:43.840
than yes, I mean, it's honestly it's just business. It's not a, oh, they should do this because it's

19:43.840 --> 19:49.840
convenient for us. It's their business model. End of story. And ultimately, the only way it's

19:49.840 --> 19:55.760
going to change is to stop paying for a switch online. But I think a lot of people aren't going

19:55.760 --> 20:01.120
to do it because there's too much other stuff like visiting Animal Crossing towns and playing

20:01.120 --> 20:05.040
Mario Kart online or Smash Brothers online. There's too much other stuff tied to it that

20:05.040 --> 20:08.720
people aren't going to want to let go of. So Nintendo looks at it and goes, success.

20:11.040 --> 20:16.160
But I kind of once again, they don't even have to put out the games in. Just don't even offer

20:16.160 --> 20:20.800
that. Just say, listen, it's just ten bucks a year or whatever it is, twenty dollars a year

20:20.800 --> 20:27.520
to pay for just play online. Done. There you go. I really do see like both ends of the frustration

20:27.520 --> 20:34.560
because like I also see that like when Nintendo launched this, they launched it with an A-list

20:34.560 --> 20:39.600
lineup of 30 titles that kind of really set an expectation. And since then, they've been

20:39.600 --> 20:46.800
buoying it with C-list titles and with an A-list very occasionally sprinkled in. Maybe in the first

20:46.800 --> 20:51.680
update there were some, you know, but now we're like, let's be real. A lot of these games I just

20:51.680 --> 20:56.720
talked about, they're not things where you're going to go like, oh my God. I mean, the magical

20:56.720 --> 21:01.440
drop thing is kind of cool, but even I can admit that is kind of niche and most people are not

21:01.440 --> 21:05.920
going to give a hoot about it. And so maybe I think that's where some of the frustration

21:05.920 --> 21:10.880
in general comes in. I do want to read this comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network

21:10.880 --> 21:16.480
because I honestly think Bobby hits it on the money here, literally saying, you know they won't do the

21:16.480 --> 21:22.880
thing everyone wants in regards to Earthbound. A retail title, but it has Earthbound

21:22.880 --> 21:30.080
beginnings, Earthbound, and finally a localized Mother 3. Yeah, Earthbound All-Stars, 60 bucks.

21:30.080 --> 21:35.440
A lot of people would pay it. Absolutely. Why not? And it will even come with a shitty statue of

21:35.520 --> 21:41.520
something from the game, a little shitty NES statue or something. I want a Mr. Saturn.

21:41.520 --> 21:46.400
A Mr. Saturn, yeah. Since someone stole my handmaid, Mr. Saturn. That's not nice.

21:46.960 --> 21:52.480
Remember the one I made for GamerX? Yeah, I do. I do. Someone stole it. Man, those conventions

21:52.480 --> 22:01.280
were so long ago. Time flies. Crazy, crazy. Anyhow, so yeah, the Nintendo Switch collection library,

22:01.600 --> 22:06.160
it's nice that it's hit 100 games, but I think there's definitely that growing sense of

22:06.160 --> 22:11.360
frustration of, are you just going to release these things in a package for 60 bucks? Or are

22:11.360 --> 22:16.640
you going to give us more of the stuff we really want? And why are there entire systems that are

22:16.640 --> 22:22.400
completely being untouched? No Game Boy, no Game Boy Advance, no N64. Even stuff as recent as Wii

22:22.400 --> 22:29.440
and GameCube. I think all of us on the show would happily plunk down the money to play F-Zero GX all

22:29.440 --> 22:35.520
over again. It's one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made. Why not? But for whatever

22:35.520 --> 22:42.720
reason, Nintendo is just like, we'll wait and we'll do a celebration later on. No they won't.

22:42.720 --> 22:47.920
We'll put an F-Zero track in Mario Kart and you'll like it. I also think that Nintendo sort of

22:48.800 --> 22:55.760
goes on one of the same principles of a few other companies out there that I won't name

22:56.320 --> 23:02.160
that like to put out, they'll put out the expected, expected, expected, and then they'll

23:02.160 --> 23:09.120
throw a crazy curveball. The one thing that maybe people have been asking for, say a few years ago,

23:09.120 --> 23:14.160
right? And then they kind of say, oh, well, it's not going to happen. And then all of a sudden,

23:14.160 --> 23:17.760
boom, this collection comes out and it's amazing. Everyone wants to buy it.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.760
I think that's when they've run out of ideas, basically. And then they start actually listening

23:23.760 --> 23:27.280
to their fans instead of thinking that they know better. That's not it. Usually companies

23:27.280 --> 23:31.280
do this on exactly on purpose. And this is why we get another Pikmin game.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.480
All right. We needed an AR Pikmin game because Pikmin is so popular.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.120
All right. Don't forget a Pikmin mobile game too. All right. Let's move on.

23:41.680 --> 23:47.840
I can't wait. I'm just like, why aren't there more Pikmin games? Forget this F-Zero nonsense.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.920
Where's my Pikmin? I'm trying to be open-minded about the mobile game, but we'll see. We'll see.

23:51.920 --> 23:56.000
All right. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.040
I know no one's playing that Pikmin game because it ain't out yet. Let's talk about our gaming

23:59.040 --> 24:02.640
weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week. So Dark Sakura, how was

24:02.640 --> 24:08.800
your gaming week? Well, it's not fucking Mass Effect yet. So my KVM switch arrived.

24:09.360 --> 24:15.120
I will be working on my computer tomorrow. I intended to do it today, but someone slept 14

24:15.120 --> 24:22.720
hours. Me. So I'm going to be hooking my PC back up, but I'm going to still play on my Mac through

24:22.720 --> 24:35.840
Steam Link. Just because honestly, I hate my PC. I have been playing, of course, a lot of Dead by

24:35.840 --> 24:39.680
Daylight because I'm really working on getting better. Although yesterday I had like a really

24:39.680 --> 24:46.080
terrible trickster match, but it was also just for me to test my gigabit ethernet on a test

24:46.080 --> 24:51.440
stream. So I wasn't really trying very hard. No, that was like the opposite of a sweaty game.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.640
What's the opposite of a sweaty game? A well air conditioned game? I guess a frozen game.

24:56.640 --> 25:04.480
Frozen game. I'd say it's a fan game. Fanned. You know, like the fan. Anyway, I also am still

25:04.480 --> 25:10.720
playing Wordscapes because it's like my brain wake up game. It's what I do. It's my bathroom game,

25:10.720 --> 25:17.520
you know? And of course, Animal Crossing. I slacked off a little bit and I really need to not

25:17.520 --> 25:24.080
slack off because I'm finally kicking Marina out in favor of getting Cyrano. I like what Siata

25:24.080 --> 25:35.760
Berry says. A well ventilated game. Thank you. Thank you. And of course, I'm actually,

25:35.760 --> 25:40.320
for reasons coming up later in this show, have a reason to play No Man's Sky.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.800
You better hurry. It's limited. It's very limited time.

25:44.800 --> 25:50.160
I know. And it's the 31st. So that means that I have to see. I think it runs on Mac,

25:50.160 --> 25:55.200
so I shouldn't have any problem there. And of course, I'm playing Fantasian. And just to

25:55.200 --> 26:01.920
reiterate, on Tuesdays at five o'clock Pacific time, I stream my playthrough of Fantasian. So

26:02.480 --> 26:08.400
for folks who don't have Apple Arcade or Apple devices on which to play this,

26:08.960 --> 26:13.600
if you're interested about the game, you know, I'm playing through. I'm exploring things that

26:13.600 --> 26:18.800
people ask me to. Probably my next game is going to be a go back and open these chests. I couldn't

26:18.800 --> 26:25.120
open session, but I'm trying to get through a full story element each time that I play. So

26:25.120 --> 26:30.320
again, for those who don't have Apple Arcade, I'm playing through the game for you and for me.

26:31.360 --> 26:35.200
Awesome. All right. It's a service, Rob. It's really a service.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.440
I caught a little bit of the stream. I was lurking because I was watching on the TV,

26:39.440 --> 26:41.920
so I don't really chat when I'm on the TV. Isn't that pretty?

26:41.920 --> 26:44.720
Oh yeah, it's a pretty game. Yeah, the whole thing about it,

26:44.720 --> 26:51.360
like their niche on it is that, well, actually, Rob, you can do that through. I'll tell you

26:51.360 --> 26:53.840
later, but you have a way to use my Apple Arcade account.

26:55.360 --> 27:00.240
Yeah. And, well, it was all about more having a way to play it, but I actually, the show,

27:00.240 --> 27:02.960
I could use the show's mini to play it if I wanted to.

27:02.960 --> 27:09.680
You absolutely can. But going back to the thing about the game is that it's all hand-built

27:09.680 --> 27:18.560
dioramas. So every background is made of real materials. Some of the enemies in the game have

27:20.240 --> 27:31.440
real textures as their render textures. So there you go. Honestly, it's worth playing.

27:31.440 --> 27:39.440
It's very fun. It definitely gives me a little bit more of an earlier Final Fantasy slash Chrono

27:39.440 --> 27:46.000
Trigger vibe. A lot of the music makes me think of Chrono Trigger. And I just, every time I play

27:46.000 --> 27:50.560
it, I'm more and more impressed with the story, especially that weird pirate guy who's not really

27:50.560 --> 27:53.360
a pirate. Okay. Yeah. I was going to say,

27:53.360 --> 27:56.240
I want to play it at some point, and that's actually why I haven't been watching your

27:56.240 --> 28:00.880
streams a lot, because I don't want to spoil myself. But for those that know they're not

28:00.880 --> 28:04.880
going to get around to it anytime soon, it's a good way to check it out. All right.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.320
Moving on, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?

28:09.600 --> 28:15.280
So my gaming week was still Minecraft, still playing on the server, still editing video.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.480
The second video is just about done. So I'm hoping to have that done tonight.

28:20.480 --> 28:26.720
And then other exciting things coming soon in regards to streaming and stuff on there. So

28:27.520 --> 28:33.280
I can't wait to talk about that once I once I can, once I have everything confirmed,

28:33.280 --> 28:43.360
but extremely exciting stuff. So stay tuned for that. And then I finally got my labels for my

28:43.360 --> 28:46.880
game cartridges for I saw on Twitter, they look great.

28:47.760 --> 28:53.440
Yeah, they kind of screwed up the first ones. So they reprinted them for me. And they're

28:54.080 --> 28:59.520
looking OK. They're looking pretty good. So I've only got enough for 12 because that's all the

28:59.520 --> 29:04.480
cartridges I have right now. But, you know, eventually we'll make more. And I still have

29:04.480 --> 29:10.480
to finish up. I had like two levels left I have to make for the game just to pad it out a bit more.

29:10.480 --> 29:16.560
And then I think we'll be ready to go. So Dibs on buying one very soon. Yes, I know

29:16.560 --> 29:21.520
lots of people want them. I don't know, like, if we should go to Kickstarter out just to do more.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.920
But like or because I haven't really figured out how to do the fulfillment part of this.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.920
You know, it's like, how do I take orders? How do I ship those orders? I mean, it's like.

29:30.960 --> 29:38.560
So we'll see. I would say use your 12 to test this whole process. Have these 12 be for the people

29:38.560 --> 29:44.080
that, you know, are closest to you and had the game. So basically, you know, me, Jamie,

29:44.880 --> 29:52.160
YYR, Bobby, I guess because he's Bobby. Jason, if he wants one. Cool. You know, like the people that

29:52.160 --> 29:57.600
probably drive and then use that as like your test thing and then do the Kickstarter to open

29:57.600 --> 30:02.320
it up to others that might be interested in it. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. So. All right.

30:02.320 --> 30:08.720
Anything else? I'm a little bit of Orna, just enough to get the rewards each day and doing

30:08.720 --> 30:13.760
that stuff. I saw that we're starting someone's remembering to do the kingdom fights now. So

30:14.320 --> 30:18.960
that's nice. We had a few of those. Anybody can start those now. I gave permissions to

30:18.960 --> 30:24.320
everybody a while ago. Oh, OK. Well, perfect. I just did not use the bot in the discord,

30:24.320 --> 30:28.720
although I don't know. I don't think we did last time either. So we'll see. All right. Yeah.

30:29.360 --> 30:34.560
All right. Let's see my gaming week. So like my biggest thing is a story later in the show. I'm

30:34.560 --> 30:38.080
sure you all know what I'm talking about, but I must sit and wait. So we'll talk about that a

30:38.080 --> 30:43.760
little later. So I spent several hours doing that. But of course, I've been playing some of

30:43.760 --> 30:48.960
the old favorites to is doing some Final Fantasy 14, leveling up my ninja, trying to get all of my

30:48.960 --> 30:53.680
characters up to level 80 by the time the next expansion comes out. And now I know I have until

30:53.680 --> 30:59.360
November. That's probably enough time for me to do it. So that's good. Also, your ninja look like

30:59.360 --> 31:04.480
like the actual ninja, like for the earlier games. No, he kind of looks different. I mean,

31:04.480 --> 31:08.720
also the ninjas have the daggers, which doesn't really match the look from the earlier games

31:10.080 --> 31:15.520
a little bit. I can see where there's like some edge influence maybe, but it kind of looks a

31:15.520 --> 31:19.920
little bit different. But I like I like the way the ninjas play in Final Fantasy. So I think I

31:19.920 --> 31:25.280
have that warrior monk and I think one other one. I got to get to 80 and then everything is 80. And

31:25.280 --> 31:31.200
that includes crafting and gathering classes, too. Do the ninjas still throw weapons?

31:32.160 --> 31:38.640
Not really. They use ninjutsu is kind of like their thing. So you do a you do a bong bong bong,

31:38.640 --> 31:42.880
you do like a three order and it goes by. And depending on what order you did things in,

31:42.880 --> 31:48.560
you can do like an AOE attack. You do like a lightning bolt you do. But they do have mug and

31:48.560 --> 31:52.880
they have something else that they can like a sneak attack, basically, like go behind and

31:54.240 --> 32:00.160
get the mob that way. But they don't. They do have a throw dagger thing, but you don't use it

32:00.400 --> 32:06.240
a lot in your rotation because it's not very powerful. But I'm thinking ninja from was it

32:06.240 --> 32:12.640
like Final Fantasy six, but maybe I'm thinking like shadow because I think he could throw stuff.

32:12.640 --> 32:18.720
But that's right. They had ninja in 11, too. I forgot about that. Yeah, didn't they? Yeah.

32:18.720 --> 32:23.040
Yeah. Yeah. But it was very different. It's very different. I don't usually shout these out during

32:23.040 --> 32:27.120
the show, but I just want to say Morissimo, thank you, because that's now 10 gift subs you've given

32:27.200 --> 32:31.600
away this evening. So that is extremely generous of you. And I just want to say thank you. Thank

32:31.600 --> 32:35.280
you for that. You don't have to, but it's very appreciated that you did. So thank you.

32:36.560 --> 32:41.520
So let's see what else for my gaming week do I want to share? Oh, Dead by Daylight, I guess.

32:42.320 --> 32:47.760
I hit rank 10 survivor, so I'm doing something right. But that's right about I think I've kind

32:47.760 --> 32:52.960
of hit the peak of where I'm going until I learn how to loop killers better and get more talents.

32:52.960 --> 32:59.120
I only have Dwight's talents and now I have Meg up to 34. So I have like one of hers,

32:59.120 --> 33:02.800
but I don't I still need to get her talents. And then I got to work on the others that I

33:02.800 --> 33:06.960
want their talents as well. So that's just like it's just a grind. You have to wait a long time.

33:08.320 --> 33:13.600
I decided when I play, I'm actually going to go for David so I can just start off with Dead Hard.

33:13.600 --> 33:18.160
Yeah. Yeah. That'll probably be the one I do next, honestly. And I bought the shirtless skin.

33:18.720 --> 33:23.920
Um, Claudette, I can play daddy David. Claudette was going to be my next one. I was just going to

33:23.920 --> 33:28.640
kind of go in order, but I actually don't think, I mean, she has self care, but a lot of, a lot of

33:28.640 --> 33:33.200
the Dead by Daylight pros actually kind of taunts self care. It's not a great talent to take because

33:33.200 --> 33:38.480
it's like, if you want to heal yourself, bring a med kit. So, you know, just take your, like your

33:38.480 --> 33:42.480
challenge points and dump them in a character that you don't want to play that has perks that

33:42.480 --> 33:47.520
you want. Like that, like what I'm doing with Bubba. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see. Um,

33:47.520 --> 33:50.800
one last little thing not to distract. No, that's fine. I'm officially a plague main.

33:51.600 --> 33:58.400
Okay. Work. Officially. I don't like playing as plague. I like plague, but she's hard to play

33:58.400 --> 34:02.480
as for me. She's the Vombie Mommy. I know. I like her. I don't like playing her. There's a

34:02.480 --> 34:08.080
difference. That's, that's for you. Go for it. I don't know if I have like a main yet. I love

34:08.080 --> 34:13.840
Pyramid Head, but I feel like I do. Honestly, I do better as Freddy and Freddy's like the toxic

34:13.840 --> 34:17.280
one that people, isn't that funny? Dark soccer, your power. Cause you were the one that bought

34:17.280 --> 34:21.280
them for me the first time, but I honestly think Freddy's my best character. So you know what you

34:21.280 --> 34:27.360
need to do then you need to level a Billy to get Tinker and throw that on Freddy and then everyone

34:27.360 --> 34:33.360
will really hate you. Oh God. Yes. Yeah. No, I do. God mode Freddy right there. Yeah. I need to,

34:33.360 --> 34:40.560
or I need to wait for, I need, I need that and pop. Well, you know, pop never shows up in the

34:40.560 --> 34:46.240
archive. No, but I actually, I, I, I don't hate playing as clown. I, I get that, you know, for

34:46.240 --> 34:52.000
folks with a phobia and stuff, it's, it's not a lot of fun, but I think his mechanics neat. Um,

34:52.000 --> 34:57.120
so yeah, I actually want to play him. So like for him and doctor, because I hate what they look like,

34:57.120 --> 35:01.680
they really set me off. I just bought different cosmetics for them. Yeah. I was actually just

35:01.680 --> 35:06.080
about to suggest that I was going to say they have that giant chicken suit for clown. And that's

35:06.080 --> 35:12.240
really funny to me. So I actually put like the ogre looking one on him, the big barbarian one.

35:12.240 --> 35:16.480
And then on doctor, I did plague doctor. Cause I really don't like the new one either.

35:16.480 --> 35:21.040
I played against a trapper today. I was survivor. I played against a trapper who was dressed like

35:21.040 --> 35:27.360
Kratos from God of war. I didn't even know that was a thing. I was like, Oh, that was

35:27.760 --> 35:33.840
like a trampus trapper as well. Oh, that's weird. I, but I, I hate going against trapper

35:34.640 --> 35:41.360
hag. Uh, those are the two on my list. It's somewhat nurse. If the nurse is good,

35:41.360 --> 35:45.200
the, the things with the, I, they, they all have jump scare mechanics and that's why I

35:45.200 --> 35:49.600
hate going against them. I'm not sure about pulling up Dwight. I always think of his white

35:49.600 --> 35:54.480
fruit and that would be an amazing survivor in that game. I'm telling you like that would be

35:54.480 --> 36:00.320
actually Dwight is kind of like that Dwight. No, the survivor we need in dead, but last dead

36:00.320 --> 36:04.800
by daylight tangent, and then I'm going to go into something else. The survivor we need the most

36:05.520 --> 36:11.040
in dead by daylight. I will, I will hear no, no other candidates. This is the one we need the most

36:11.040 --> 36:16.240
is Brenda from scary movie. That is the one we need the most. Well, we have ghost face,

36:17.120 --> 36:23.520
you know, scary movie, scary movie was the, um, the Keenan Ivory Waynes, uh, one. And then that

36:23.520 --> 36:28.800
the airplane guy, but it had a ghost face knockoff in it. It did. It did. But Brenda

36:28.800 --> 36:35.920
was the best and her and Cindy need to be survivors. So it has been a while since we

36:35.920 --> 36:41.280
did a list last, you know, I know, right. Maybe, maybe in the future. We'll see. We'll see.

36:41.280 --> 36:48.480
All right. Um, survivors for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, let's see what else did my gaming week?

36:48.480 --> 36:52.080
I I'm suddenly at a loss for what else? I thought there was something else I wanted to talk about,

36:52.080 --> 36:56.000
but I forget. So, Oh, well, uh, we're going to get in. Did you talk about the game that's coming

36:56.000 --> 37:02.480
back up later? No, cause I'm waiting for it to come up later. Okay. It's no man's sky. I played

37:02.480 --> 37:06.640
a lot of still say you played it. I played it. I played it and we'll talk about why in a little

37:06.640 --> 37:12.400
bit. Um, let's see, uh, some other quick little like housekeeping items to get into before we get

37:12.400 --> 37:16.960
into, um, the stories for tonight. Number one, uh, we're not going to be here next week, Memorial

37:16.960 --> 37:21.920
Day weekend, because, um, I'm gonna keep it real. I was looking at the calendar of like the shows

37:21.920 --> 37:27.760
and I was like, we haven't taken a night off since October when I took that trip to Idaho. Um, and

37:28.480 --> 37:32.000
I, one of my friends is going to be in town in the Bay area. And I'm like, you know what? I think

37:32.000 --> 37:37.200
I'm just gonna take the weekend off. I want a night off. So I'm using some PTO, uh, next week.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.040
And then when I talked to, I was like, Hey, Matt, Jamie, you guys can still do a show. And they were

37:41.040 --> 37:48.640
like, night off sounds good. So, uh, a night off it is so, and you know what the reality is too.

37:49.200 --> 37:54.160
I think just because so many people are getting vaccinated and have gotten vaccinated. Like if

37:54.160 --> 37:58.960
you think about it, vaccination opened up to everybody, what, like April 15th. So that was

37:58.960 --> 38:03.920
about six weeks ago. So most people that were on it right away, like I know Alan was one of them.

38:03.920 --> 38:08.000
He now is hit his full VAX. And I think that's going to be a lot of people this Memorial Day

38:08.000 --> 38:11.520
weekend. Um, so I think there's just going to be a lot of people that just want to go

38:11.520 --> 38:18.080
do that weekend. Now, of course, I don't want to advocate like, Oh, don't it's, it's over,

38:18.080 --> 38:22.640
be careless. No, no, I'm not trying to say that, but I think, you know, and obviously the CDC has

38:22.640 --> 38:27.680
said, if you're vaccinated, there's a lot you can do. Uh, and I think it's time that people go do

38:27.680 --> 38:35.120
them. Um, so, uh, I think dropping the mask mandate or something like that in June, in June,

38:35.120 --> 38:41.840
and it won't apply to really big events, um, where like outdoor events, you'll still have to,

38:41.840 --> 38:48.320
uh, either have proof of a test or a vaccination. Um, but anyway, but that varies state to state,

38:48.320 --> 38:53.920
some states it's just, it doesn't matter anymore. Um, but, uh, yeah. So anyway, my point is,

38:53.920 --> 38:59.360
uh, I I'm, I've got other plans next weekend and my inkling is a lot of you have plans next weekend

38:59.360 --> 39:04.480
as well. Um, so we'll just take a week off. Maybe we'll do something. Maybe we'll do something

39:04.480 --> 39:10.480
special during the stream or something. Um, well, I said many, not all. I'm actually thinking about

39:10.480 --> 39:17.600
doing, um, a marathon stream. Go work, do it. Yeah. Hey, we'll see. Yeah. Um, but you know what,

39:17.600 --> 39:20.880
as well, Jamie, if you just want to take a night off as well, sometimes it's just nice to have the

39:20.880 --> 39:25.600
rest of relaxation. So don't feel obligated, you know? Yeah. I got 14 hours of that, Rob.

39:27.520 --> 39:32.640
A lot of people in chat are just like, cool. We get it. Uh, SSU 100, Matt says, totally get it.

39:32.640 --> 39:38.480
I took time off this weekend to see folks I haven't seen in a while. Um, and I, DGRMS says,

39:38.480 --> 39:42.880
indeed. I spent the weekend with a friend of mine out of town at depth is bringing up the Pogo

39:42.880 --> 39:50.800
special event, which did not play into my decision, but it is a nice perk. Um, I didn't know this.

39:50.800 --> 39:57.280
See it to Beery with the random fact about scary movie. Apparently Lori Beth Denberg from all that

39:57.280 --> 40:03.360
was approached for the cameo that eventually went to Marissa Jarrett Winokur from, I think

40:03.360 --> 40:07.760
she's from hairspray. Um, I didn't know that. I love Lori Beth Denberg. I wish she'd done the

40:07.760 --> 40:13.040
role, but I also respect if she, uh, you know, she wants to stay retired or whatever, whatever

40:13.040 --> 40:19.600
she's doing. Um, the other big announcement, um, channel point reward streams here at VOG Network.

40:19.600 --> 40:25.600
So Bobby did the last one. So Bobby did, uh, he just on like Thursday, maybe it was Wednesday.

40:25.600 --> 40:30.720
What is time? Sorry. I can't remember. But earlier this week at VOG, he did, uh, a, uh,

40:30.720 --> 40:36.240
stream where he looked at, uh, E3 tapes that he did in the year 2000. So it was kind of like old

40:36.240 --> 40:40.640
tapes of what, and it was actually kind of neat because he had a game in there. It was like, I

40:40.640 --> 40:45.680
think it was Simville or something. It was a game that was supposed to be like the Sims meets Sim

40:45.680 --> 40:52.640
city. It actually never came out, but he had like 10 minutes worth of like filming the footage

40:52.640 --> 40:56.800
because they were showing it at this E3. And I thought there was a lot of like neat stuff like

40:56.800 --> 41:00.800
that in it. And I think that's kind of the fun part about going back and looking at old stuff.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.400
It's not just like, Oh, what's the cringe wrestling event that I filmed. Cause there's

41:04.400 --> 41:09.520
a lot of that too. But, uh, you know, what, what were like the things that never actually happened

41:09.520 --> 41:14.320
or what were they, you know, looking like there that they didn't, uh, end up looking like actually.

41:14.320 --> 41:19.600
So, um, that's kind of cool. What, Oh my God. See it. I'm sorry. This is a tangent,

41:19.600 --> 41:23.040
but it's important. See it to be where he says that Lori Beth Demberg has a podcast.

41:23.040 --> 41:28.720
What I'm going to subscribe to that one. Absolutely. All right. Um, let's see. So

41:28.720 --> 41:32.960
what is the next channel point reward here at OLR? Um, I'm going to head this one up.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.880
I threatened this one before I'm going to make good on it, but I'm only going to promise myself

41:36.880 --> 41:41.840
participating in this. Cause I don't know if Jamie and Matt want to do it, but we're going to do an

41:41.840 --> 41:47.840
episode one, listen through with commentary and talk about the old school days of the show. So

41:47.920 --> 41:54.800
with rock, I'm down. What you said when I brought this up before you were, you were firmly in the

41:54.800 --> 42:00.880
hell no column. Have you changed your mind on this? I'll do it. I mean, I hate listening to my

42:00.880 --> 42:07.200
own voice, but I've had to go back and clip my own stream since no one will help me with it. Um, so

42:08.160 --> 42:18.880
I'll do it low key. I had a migraine the whole episode. Sure. Oh, OMG. The value of this stream

42:18.880 --> 42:22.640
just should have doubled how long it would be concerning. I think we had a lot of music breaks

42:22.640 --> 42:28.720
in there. We did. So, so, you know, um, footnote, obviously I have to work around the music breaks

42:28.720 --> 42:34.480
and things like that. So it's not going to be like uncut completely, but within reason,

42:34.560 --> 42:38.080
we're going to listen to the whole thing. Um, and just talk about like the first episode is

42:38.080 --> 42:43.520
there's a lot of stories about that first episode. Like where the hell did this show come from? Um,

42:43.520 --> 42:48.320
why was it like a house party thing? There's like probably seven special guests on the first show.

42:48.320 --> 42:52.480
Why was it like low key was one of them. Technically. Why was the show like that back

42:52.480 --> 42:57.040
in the day? So there's a lot of good stories, um, from back in the day to talk about. So that's

42:57.040 --> 43:01.120
going to be a channel point where we're, um, Bobby, if you have, I'm sorry, really important,

43:01.120 --> 43:06.400
Bobby, if you haven't already activated it, you, ah, I was going to suggest he just activated. I

43:06.400 --> 43:10.400
was going to say you may want to hold it because we're not going to be here next week. And so

43:10.400 --> 43:17.520
that's going to be one less week. We can collect the, um, rewards. So Bobby, I leave it up to you

43:17.520 --> 43:21.520
if you think we'll hit it. Uh, okay. Oh, Bobby says we can extend the time. Okay, perfect.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.040
So we'll extend it an additional week for the week, but we're off. Perfect. Thank you. Thank

43:25.040 --> 43:28.960
you. Sorry, Jamie. I cut you off, but that was very important because I want to make sure we

43:28.960 --> 43:34.240
set a reasonable goal for the channel point donations here live. All right. You sure are.

43:35.920 --> 43:42.560
So, um, my, um, I re I remember that cause, you know, I sometimes get that,

43:42.560 --> 43:49.760
that visual memory in place. So I was on that blue armchair lazy boy or whatever it was

43:50.720 --> 43:56.480
laying across it with a cheap headset on like one of my work headsets or something.

43:57.280 --> 44:04.080
And there was a computer or TV right in front toward the middle. And on the other side was

44:04.080 --> 44:12.160
the kitchen in that big vaulted room. Am I right? That's right. Your, your mic on the first episode

44:12.160 --> 44:18.800
was shitty. Yeah. Cause I, all I had was that headset cause we didn't have another mic. But

44:18.800 --> 44:24.400
the first episode of orange lounge radio and, and kind of what, one of the reasons why I'm like,

44:24.960 --> 44:30.480
now is a good time to do it. We're coming up on our 19th anniversary. So around the time you guys

44:30.480 --> 44:35.040
raised the channel, because Bobby said a high bar for this one, it's going to be 150,000 points,

44:35.040 --> 44:39.920
but this is, it's going to be a good one. Um, the, the reason it's going to be timed right

44:39.920 --> 44:45.600
around our 19th anniversary. And if you think about it, your 19th birthday means you're entering

44:45.600 --> 44:50.560
your 20th year, right? And then your 20th birthday is the celebration of the 20th year, right? Your

44:50.560 --> 44:55.600
first birthday is celebration of one year. So we are entering our 20th year of orange lounge radio.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.680
So I think this is a really interesting way to look back and go like just how far we've come

44:59.680 --> 45:07.120
because I'm not, it is no secret. Episode one is going to be really, really shitty. And that is why

45:07.760 --> 45:13.360
Loki dark soccer, myself, we all kind of don't want to listen to it, but I also think it's a

45:13.360 --> 45:17.680
really great thing to do to just go like, look how fucking far we've come and talk about some

45:17.680 --> 45:22.480
of the things we've learned. Like these are the things in episode one that didn't work at all,

45:22.480 --> 45:25.520
you know, and why we do the show differently now. So I actually think there's going to be

45:25.520 --> 45:30.160
like a lot to learn from it and it'll be really cool. Um, and tiger claw points out also,

45:30.960 --> 45:36.000
you've got to take into account the technology you had at the time wasn't as good as what we have

45:36.000 --> 45:40.240
today. Uh, and that's very true. Another reason why the first episode of orange launch radio is

45:40.240 --> 45:49.120
garbagey is because we were dial-up friendly radio on live 365. Remember 2002, not everybody

45:49.120 --> 45:56.080
had, we had screaming fast DSL at our house. That's how we were able to do this radio.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.560
You know what? You know what our 20th birthday is going to be? It's going to be, uh, uh,

46:00.560 --> 46:06.800
Seijin Shiki, which, uh, turning 20 in Japan is the coming of age. Interesting.

46:07.040 --> 46:13.360
Interesting. Yeah. I, I, I, I, I, I'm going to be completely and utterly honest. I,

46:13.360 --> 46:17.920
I absolutely think OLR will make it to 20 years. I think at this point we kind of have an obligation

46:17.920 --> 46:24.480
to get to our 20th birthday. I don't know how much further after that. I mean, but I,

46:24.480 --> 46:28.400
but keep in mind before you all panic and go like, Oh my God, what is Rob saying?

46:28.400 --> 46:36.080
We set this back like the second year of the show. Like if we actually hit episode 573,

46:37.040 --> 46:42.560
we, we, we have no life. We're idiots. And now here we are on like episode 870,

46:43.280 --> 46:47.440
but yeah. And Bobby says that in chat. Rob also said this at the 10th birthday and the 15th

46:47.440 --> 46:54.080
birthday. So I'm saying it again. I don't know how we like the show will get to its 20th birthday.

46:54.080 --> 47:00.240
Yes. Will it get to its 40th? I don't think it can. I just don't think it will be geriatric.

47:00.240 --> 47:05.200
Uh, we will be, we really will be geriatric millennials or geriatric Gen X is the case.

47:05.200 --> 47:13.040
Maybe, um, unless we hand the show off to other people, which is a distinct possibility. We've,

47:13.040 --> 47:20.640
we've always joked for a long time. Loki's kid, uh, Julian and somebody else will volunteer,

47:20.640 --> 47:26.960
uh, can do the show in the future. So anyway, but you know, you know what,

47:26.960 --> 47:31.360
though, this is going to be kind of an observation and it's going to make me sound like a, you know,

47:31.440 --> 47:40.720
a really old bitch, but I think that having this incentive to stay up with our current video game

47:40.720 --> 47:47.760
culture, I don't know. I think it kind of keeps one young. Uh, absolutely it does. But then you

47:47.760 --> 47:52.000
also like, you start to look at where video game culture is going sometimes and you're like, God,

47:52.640 --> 47:59.200
like, you know, we did this. So, I mean, I, I, again, I don't want to like make everybody

47:59.200 --> 48:02.640
and make anybody freak out or anything or like, Oh my God, is Rob announcing retirement? No, no,

48:02.640 --> 48:05.760
no, no, no, no, no. But it is definitely one of those things. Like when she started to approach

48:05.760 --> 48:12.080
20 years, you're like, how much longer are we really going to do this? You know? So we'll see.

48:12.080 --> 48:17.760
And so we're recognized by Guinness. I guess so. Well, we haven't submitted to Guinness.

48:17.760 --> 48:23.440
And I think, I think there's a part of that too, that like, we keep going because we are the

48:23.440 --> 48:30.880
longest running show. If we stop, we're not that anymore. You know, and I can think of like three

48:30.880 --> 48:35.600
other shows that can't wait to snatch the title, which, which they all worked hard and they've all

48:35.600 --> 48:42.960
deserved it. But, and I honestly don't know who's the oldest, but, um, uh, yeah, but it's like,

48:42.960 --> 48:46.560
if once we stopped doing it, we can't really claim that title anymore. So that's kinda,

48:47.200 --> 48:52.400
you know, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I know that's the case with me because kids in

48:52.400 --> 48:56.720
the neighborhood talk about games and try to dumb it down for me as an adult. And then they

48:56.720 --> 49:02.400
get surprised. Oh yeah. How do you do fellow kids? Like, yeah, totally. I get it double

49:02.400 --> 49:08.720
for being, you know, mostly female, even though you're, you're a girl, you don't play games. Um,

49:08.720 --> 49:15.360
I hope you know that it's now more than 50% of gamers out there are female or female identified.

49:15.360 --> 49:20.160
I know, especially with like gen Z, if you will, or like the younger generation,

49:20.160 --> 49:24.880
I thought it was kind of an accepted fact. Boys and girls both play games period. Like,

49:24.880 --> 49:29.920
it's not like, it's just part of culture or period. Um, so it is fascinating that some

49:29.920 --> 49:35.600
people still hold that archaic perspective, but it's, it's more, it's people our age that do,

49:36.240 --> 49:40.800
which is unfortunate. Bobby was saying sadly though, since I don't play Fortnite or Warzone,

49:40.800 --> 49:44.480
they're like, well, you're not really a gamer at my response to that. Well, I actually play good

49:44.480 --> 49:50.480
games. Uh, my response to that would be like, all right, I'll listen here. You little shit.

49:51.040 --> 49:56.720
We're going to, and that's exactly what I'm saying to that child. I actually am playing good games.

49:56.720 --> 50:03.120
Listen here. You suck. Challenge that kid to a tournament on a, on the Atari 2,600 game of

50:03.120 --> 50:09.840
your choice and watch them cry. You know, no, no, even better. Challenge them to mega man too.

50:10.560 --> 50:17.120
Mm hmm. Or one of those or, or battle toads. Challenge them to battle toads. See,

50:17.120 --> 50:20.960
see how well they do. Make them cry for saying what they said, Bobby.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.640
Play through guardian legend on TGL mode. I'll wait.

50:27.440 --> 50:32.720
Uh, let's see. Bobby Blackwell says a friend's nine year old started trash talking me about

50:32.720 --> 50:38.720
smash brothers and his dad was like, oh, you know not what you're doing, sweet summer child.

50:40.160 --> 50:45.280
Yeah. Yeah. Usually when I get teabagged by survivors and dead by daylight, I'm like,

50:45.280 --> 50:49.840
they're a 13 year old. I know it. God, that makes me so angry.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.960
And you know, it's funny. This is a big reason why I like playing plague.

50:53.760 --> 50:58.160
It's because all I have to do is get the blood puke and chases them out immediately.

51:00.400 --> 51:05.360
And then I get the extra blood points. Uh, let's get into some, uh, gaming news. Sorry.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.320
We had quite the tangent there, but, and it was just basically old man,

51:08.720 --> 51:13.120
and woman yell at cloud, but, um, you know, it is what it is. All right, let's move on to,

51:13.120 --> 51:16.960
uh, what's going on in the gaming industry this week. Uh, big news about a big title, right?

51:18.080 --> 51:24.720
Yeah. So Overwatch two, they've basically said that the new game is going to drop the team size

51:24.720 --> 51:30.800
down from six players to five. And basically saying that the game has changed over time

51:30.800 --> 51:35.200
and we've gone from having no hero limits to having a hero limit.

51:35.200 --> 51:40.480
We introduced new roll lock over the course of the game. And we feel that this is the next step

51:40.480 --> 51:48.080
to that Overwatch ought to be played. Um, so that's interesting. And then of course it has,

51:48.080 --> 51:53.600
you know, folks wondering that are on these professional teams with six players,

51:53.600 --> 52:00.400
you know, uh, am I going to be dropped from the team? So, um, yeah, it's interesting.

52:00.400 --> 52:05.440
Obviously it's a bit early to see, you know, what's going to happen, but with the change to

52:05.440 --> 52:10.320
five E five, um, there is a possibility that some of these players will be benched.

52:11.200 --> 52:16.800
Now I haven't played Overwatch in some time. Um, it is for those of you in chat, uh, over at

52:16.800 --> 52:21.440
twitch.tv slash vog network that do play more Overwatch currently than I do. Is this like some

52:21.440 --> 52:26.400
type of response to the fact that not enough people are playing tank? And so the cues are very

52:26.400 --> 52:31.040
long for everybody except tank. Like, is this kind of why they're rebalancing it in this way?

52:31.040 --> 52:34.960
Cause that was my first gut reaction because I do remember I was playing a little bit when

52:34.960 --> 52:38.960
those roles first went live and yeah, like you were going to wait in a queue if you weren't a

52:38.960 --> 52:45.200
tank period. So, uh, some folks in chat act def says, uh, kind of in chat. Okay. Good enough for

52:45.200 --> 52:49.680
me. Uh, as showing her mat says, yeah, the five player match thing throws things off already

52:49.680 --> 52:53.600
strategy wise. Well, it is a big change. It is certainly going to separate the sequel from the

52:53.600 --> 52:59.600
original that's for sure. Yeah. So I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's the,

52:59.600 --> 53:04.400
I don't think they really outlined what their exact reasoning was for that. Um, probably not

53:04.400 --> 53:09.760
to anger people, but it's the change that they're making as of right now. Let's, you know, fan

53:09.760 --> 53:16.400
backlash. And in which case they could go back on that, but it is what it is. It's interesting. Um,

53:16.400 --> 53:22.000
because, uh, uh, well, the act-def in chat says they're rebalancing because tanks make it a bit

53:22.000 --> 53:26.560
more complicated. I was gonna say it's interesting because that creative director guy, Jeff Kaplan,

53:26.560 --> 53:32.080
right. Was his name. He just left overwatch not that long ago. Um, you know, again, I don't want

53:32.080 --> 53:36.480
to be too like conspiracy theorist or whatever, but maybe there were some changes that were coming

53:36.480 --> 53:42.080
that he didn't necessarily agree with that the team wanted to do. Uh, I don't know. I don't know.

53:42.080 --> 53:46.800
I don't think it's related. I really don't, but it's, I'm sure I'm certain I'm not the first

53:46.800 --> 53:53.760
person to wonder that out loud. So, Hmm. Well, I'll still, I'll still be curious about overwatch

53:53.760 --> 53:58.400
too. That's for sure. I wish they'd unveil some more characters, um, and show a little bit more

53:58.400 --> 54:02.240
of what the game's actually going to look like, but I guess it's still some time out. So, um,

54:02.240 --> 54:06.320
you know, they're not releasing it this year. Uh, we're getting that Diablo two remaster this year

54:06.320 --> 54:10.000
and that's about it from well, and then while classic, uh, burning crusade just happened.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.600
Um, but that's about it or no is happening June 1st. My bad, uh, soon. Uh, but that's, uh, about

54:15.600 --> 54:21.040
it from blizzard this year. So we have, uh, next year Diablo four, which I'm all about that one.

54:21.040 --> 54:25.520
And then, uh, Overwatch two, hopefully to look forward to. So that'd be good. Um,

54:26.400 --> 54:31.520
something else to look forward to that people have been asking for, for a long time here on Twitch

54:31.520 --> 54:38.080
TV is new tags. Um, and I think we've talked about it before on this show. Uh, there's a lot of

54:38.160 --> 54:45.120
people that have been wanting a trans tag for quite some time, uh, to, um, help, uh, trans people,

54:45.120 --> 54:53.280
uh, find each other on the platform. Uh, granted, um, you know, one of the letters in LGBTQ is T um,

54:53.280 --> 55:02.160
but I, I get it. It's not that tag is kind of dominated by a lot of, um, CIS white women and

55:02.160 --> 55:08.640
CIS white gay men, like is kind of like what's, what's there. Uh, there's not a lot of other,

55:08.640 --> 55:13.040
like, like it's, it's hard sometimes to find trans people within that tag. Um,

55:13.040 --> 55:19.360
The other, the other one is allies using the LGBTQIA when the aid does not stand for ally.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.640
Yes. I get it. So I know ally is getting their own tag.

55:22.640 --> 55:27.600
Yes. That, that is one of the other, uh, 350 tags that is coming. And I also like that one,

55:27.600 --> 55:33.520
you know, yeah, I, believe me, I totally agree. Allies should not be using that tag. I it's,

55:33.520 --> 55:39.280
it's, I realized they have the best intentions. I don't know anybody. Well, okay. You're right.

55:39.280 --> 55:43.680
There's always some people that are, but I, most people, and I'm willing to give most people the

55:43.680 --> 55:49.120
benefit of the doubt, had good intentions using that tag for that reason. Um, but that's why,

55:49.120 --> 55:53.120
you know, if you educate somebody and say, Hey, here's why you shouldn't, most people are going

55:53.120 --> 55:57.200
to be pretty good and change it up. Um, but I think it's good that Twitch is coming in and just

55:57.200 --> 56:00.480
making the tags a little bit more clear. So here's what's going on. Twitch is going to be

56:00.480 --> 56:06.480
introducing 350 plus community tags. That's a lot of tags. And honestly, I couldn't even tell you

56:06.480 --> 56:10.800
the entire list. I think it is linked somewhere, but I'm just, I'm kind of waiting for it to roll

56:10.800 --> 56:16.080
out to see what happened. Uh, Twitch in a tweet earlier this week, Friday afternoon.

56:17.040 --> 56:22.400
Said we had planned to share this next week, but we've heard a lot of you talking and we

56:22.400 --> 56:27.920
want to make sure the record is clear next week. We'll be adding 350 plus new tags to

56:27.920 --> 56:34.400
celebrate yourself and your community. And of course, trans. Well, probably came from

56:34.400 --> 56:38.160
their blog posts about how they're having a dedicated, you know, a hot tub channel.

56:38.160 --> 56:42.000
And people are like, well, wait a second. Why aren't you addressing this other thing?

56:42.000 --> 56:48.160
You are one come in, save face. You are 100% correct. Because they went, I mean,

56:48.800 --> 56:53.920
I guess technically we don't know what Twitch was doing, but we do know they put out a blog post

56:53.920 --> 57:00.480
that was like, Hey, um, we're not going to ban hot tub streamers because they are quote unquote,

57:00.480 --> 57:06.000
sexy. Like we're not banning someone for being conventionally attractive. Like that's getting

57:06.000 --> 57:11.680
there in category, right? Exactly. They're getting their own category and you know what I cool.

57:11.680 --> 57:16.960
I, I, I agree like Twitch is more than just gaming. And if that's what somebody wants to do,

57:16.960 --> 57:21.840
and if that's what people want to watch, I myself will probably not be watching.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.240
I certainly won't be creating that content. Well, maybe a future channel point reward. We'll see.

57:26.960 --> 57:32.320
But for the most part, I don't plan to participate, but it doesn't affect me if it exists.

57:33.360 --> 57:38.000
Right? Because that's the same thing that I'm saying about a lot of these other tags

57:38.000 --> 57:41.760
is that it doesn't change. You know what? Let people have the tags they want

57:41.760 --> 57:45.120
and identify how they want. It's not going to change your life whatsoever.

57:45.120 --> 57:48.080
And that's kind of how I feel about the hot tub stuff at this point. Let them,

57:48.080 --> 57:53.600
let them do their thing. Have fun. But by announcing that in their,

57:53.600 --> 57:58.400
that they're getting their own category. Absolutely. Everybody responded and said,

57:58.400 --> 58:06.640
Hey, Twitch, fuck you. Like we've been asking for a trans tag for over a year and hot tub streamers

58:06.640 --> 58:14.640
get a tag, get a category first. And it kind of caused a subsequent call out to happen

58:14.720 --> 58:20.480
where folks were saying, you know what? I bet Twitch is just sitting on this.

58:20.480 --> 58:26.640
And here comes pride month, June 1st, they're going to say, Oh, look what we're doing for

58:26.640 --> 58:31.120
pride. Cause we're the greatest company in the world. And here's your rainbow Twitch logo

58:31.120 --> 58:34.880
and 350 tags that you've been asking for for the longest time. And you know what?

58:36.240 --> 58:40.720
Those people with those comments were absolutely right. Clearly. And Twitch realized,

58:40.720 --> 58:44.800
fuck, if we now announce this on June 1st, the start of pride month,

58:45.440 --> 58:49.760
we're going to look super performative and that it's just a corporate thing and all this other

58:49.760 --> 58:54.720
stuff. And so that's why they announced it Friday afternoon. And they said, we'd plan to announce

58:54.720 --> 59:01.200
this next week. Well, what's next week, the weekend leading up to June 1st.

59:02.960 --> 59:06.720
So it was performative. So yes, it was absolutely planned to be this,

59:06.720 --> 59:14.480
but you know what? It's movement in the right direction. Yes. We can say about fucking time.

59:14.480 --> 59:19.760
Yes. We can say you only did this because XYZ, but I think at the same time we have to go and we say,

59:20.320 --> 59:26.240
but you did it. Thank you. The community asks for this. You're finally giving it to the community.

59:26.240 --> 59:30.320
Thank you. Let's move forward and build a stronger community together now that we have what we've

59:30.320 --> 59:33.920
been asking for. Let's look forward. And I think there's a lot of people kind of taking that

59:33.920 --> 59:41.600
approach. So, let's see. They apparently worked with organizations like glad and able gamers to

59:41.600 --> 59:46.320
develop these tags. Yes, that's true. Also says, you know what, Rob? I didn't think of that,

59:46.320 --> 59:51.360
but I totally get it now. Lego kind of got some of that for the rainbow pride set they announced.

59:51.360 --> 59:56.640
Yes. And that's kind of what it is. It's like, okay, cool. Everybody's gay in June. Awesome.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.600
How are you the rest of the year? And this is what a lot of marginalized communities, again,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.640
I'm not black. I'm not going to in any way try to speak for that community. But a lot of message

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:14.080
that I hear from folks is February. Yes, is, you know, Black History Month. But it would be really

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.920
great if we learned about black people 365 days a year. Like that should be a thing that we learn

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:26.400
about in schools and in curriculum. Juneteenth should be a thing that we learn about in schools

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.120
and not just like, oh, you know, February, right? And that is really be a nationally

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.720
recognized holiday. It is a very similar discussion when it comes to things like pride

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.040
is it's like, that's great, you know, and again, it's kind of like one of those I'm sure you have

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:50.160
good intentions. But how do you treat how did the policies of your company treat gay people,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:56.000
trans people, and all sorts of marginalized people the rest of the time of the year? That's what this

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.920
boils down to. So, and deejirama S. responds, Rob, I feel this so hard in February. And

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.040
Bonsoblo6 says you hit the F a nail on the head, Rob. How are you the rest of the year?

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.520
Dark Tetsuya says Mishkin says thank you from over on the couch during playing Final Fantasy 14.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.400
You're welcome, because I've learned a lot of this from you guys. And you want to go back to

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.320
20 years of Orange Lounge Radio. And even though I'm aging as faster and so forth, and what is

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.920
different between episode one and today? I've learned a lot of shit. I've learned a lot of shit.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.200
And I think a lot of you guys have too. I think we've all learned from each other.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.760
And that's one beautiful thing about all of this. So okay, anyhow, where was I? Oh, yes,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:51.040
I was talking about the Twitch tags. What else do we have? We have I didn't talk. So I've been

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.600
talking about the trans tag, but it's important to notice. Note, the other tags are going to be

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:02.640
related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:10.240
Black, disabled, veteran, VTuber. I'm very sorry to show my ignorance here. I do not know what

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:17.280
VTuber virtual Youtubers virtual stream virtual avatar streamers. Oh, okay. I did not know what

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.960
that meant. Sorry. Okay. And they're going to remove references to Ally from that tag and

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:31.040
give allies their own tag as we were talking about before. I am of this mindset. I'm of this mindset

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.480
that like, if you are streaming on Twitch, you should be an ally in the first place.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:43.600
And like people that aren't should be. And when I say ally, I don't mean just LG. I don't mean,

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.240
I mean the new flag that also has a decent human being. Yes, like that. And that's always the thing

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.520
that kind of got me about it is like, like Twitch should just like, if you can't treat people

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.720
different than you decently, I don't think you should be on this platform. Like, you know, go,

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.280
go start your own website. You shouldn't be on this one, but that's, I don't know. Maybe folks

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.240
think I'm a little bit too harsh with that, but I, you don't have to, you don't have to sit there

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.800
and scream gay rights on your stream. You don't have to do that, but like you can like not say

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:23.440
fag on your stream. You can not do that. But Rob, what the whole thing of having an ally tag though

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:33.040
has extra meaning for me as an asexual person. Oh, of course. Of course. We are a very overlooked

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:39.200
minority in the community. Um, a couple of the, um, the streamers that, you know, I'm pretty much

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.040
regular in their chats, like, uh, losing color puddings, um, naked prints, a few of them we've

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.280
actually, it's opened up that conversation in a few of, of those chats about, and there's people

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.280
in there who legit don't know that the aid does not stand for ally. I totally get it. Yeah. And

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.800
going in and educating people and having them be receptive to it has been amazing. You're right.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:11.680
And I think I might be talking about a mindset that has existed on Twitch that will get better

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.840
maybe because of this and because it's going to be separated and so forth. And I would bet

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.920
I haven't looked, but with 350 tags, I have no choice but to assume a sexuality is going to be

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:29.360
a tag. Uh, I really do hope so. I can't confirm that, but yeah, I really do hope that it is if

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.240
transgender is going to have their own tag us ace folks need one too, or the, you know, the

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.680
non-binary community, um, tends to be also overlooked too, because people are so stuck in

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.520
this binary point of view. But, um, I mean, I'm also wondering since they were bringing up, um,

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:51.520
religious identity and nationality, if I'm going to see like a Jewish tag or a Muslim tag or

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.200
something like that, maybe, um, well, I guess we'll see. Uh, I don't know if they've published

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.800
the list. Um, but we'll find out next week. That's for sure. Peer to peer had Jewish as

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:09.040
an identity on there, which of course I put in right away. Um, cause I don't really find many

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.960
people who are outwardly, you know, public about their, about being Jewish on Twitch.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.600
And I think that when you see that, you know, if you look past the stereotypes and see that,

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.480
we're all just like people that it would remove some of the stigma.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.280
Um, uh, what else is it going to say with it? Oh, I was just gonna say, I'm glad that Twitch

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.480
is doing this. Um, I, I was always kind of like a little bit surprised, like, like I think if I

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.800
was kind of like in charge of Twitch, like how might I have done this? I might've had ways that

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:49.520
you can identify you, the streamer or your community and tags that play into this, you know,

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.600
honestly, the fact that I'm in my forties. And streaming on Twitch, I think is worthy of a tag

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.840
of some sort because, you know, we are, there's not a lot of folks in their forties that are

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.920
streaming on Twitch. There really isn't. I, and I, of course I would like to have a tag so that

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.680
people know I'm a gay guy that plays games and, and you know, other things that speak to me as

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.000
well. And I think, um, for like your community and for yourself and that, so you would have

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.680
tags for that that are kind of like permanent for your, well, not permanent. You can always

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.560
change them, but they're like account wide, if you will account wide tags. And then the streams

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:28.320
that you create have their own tags. So it's like, okay, I am the 40 something gay guy that is doing

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:34.880
a hot tub stream today, you know, or whatever it is. Or I am doing a retro stream where I guess,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.800
cause hot tub is going to be a category now and people might say, Oh, it's you're talking.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.840
Well, okay. No. Um, and today I'm doing a retro stream where you can ask me anything.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.320
And, uh, I'm taking audience requests. Cause those are all things that are tags right now.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:54.240
Like, and I, I would like to have separated things that way. You're you're like who you are versus

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.360
what is in this piece of content that you're making. Do you know where, do you know where

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.280
that idea is at? And it works pretty well. Pornhub and I'll leave it at that.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.880
I've heard surprisingly progressive. I've I've heard.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:21.440
I, I wouldn't know myself. All right. Anyhow. Okay. Uh, let's move on. Um, let's see. Uh,

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.120
it's my turn. Yes, it is. Sorry. I was just looking at comments in the chat, uh, because,

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.560
uh, pod culture is like old fart tag as she, 100 Matt says geriatric millennial tag. Sure. Even

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.160
though technically I'm Gen X. I'll add something about that. Um, and this is, and it's not like

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.280
a toot my own horn because yeah, I have good genes and take care of myself. But like when

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:48.160
I've been streaming, I'll legit have people who are surprised that I'm 45, but I take care of

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:57.280
myself and you know, I think that people are staying younger longer because we're realizing

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:05.040
that that attitude is, it's something that society has put on us that you have these expectations of

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.240
you. And I think our generation is one of the first ones to break from it, you know? Yeah.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:19.200
And so, um, like I all the time, you know, we'll get, um, oh, well you can't have remembered that

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.520
or on the phone with my job, you know, I'll be like, oh yeah, my first computer was a Coleco

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:32.960
Adam. Like you can't, you can't have had that. Was it like third hand? I'm like, no, you know,

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.920
but I think that this is the thing that, you know, I'm not so sure that I'm down for the age

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:45.520
tag on there just because I don't really think it's relevant anymore except for the, the mental

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.880
aspect of it, their perspective that you give, I suppose. Um, and again, tags are always an opt

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.480
in thing, you know, just cause they have the tag doesn't mean you have to, you know, and there's

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.040
some, there are some folks within the trans community that would not like to use those tags

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.240
and that is completely a person's choice. Some people feel that if they use the tag,

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.680
they're going to be opening themselves to, um, people coming in to abuse the channel and be,

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.040
be shits online. Basically I completely get that. And if somebody doesn't want to use it for that

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:22.160
reason, um, I a hundred percent, 150% support it. Like you, I get it. However, I am also glad,

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.920
sorry, Jamie. I'm also very glad that Twitch said as a part of this statement, we understand,

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.960
and I don't have the exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, sorry, but basically like,

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.000
we understand the concern that these tags could open up channels to abuse and we want to make

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.800
clear this abuse is not acceptable on our platform and they are bannable offenses. That was my,

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.640
honestly, that part was the best part about this whole announcement to me is that they have made

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:54.080
it very clear. Harassment has no place on this platform. Good. It shouldn't. Sorry, Jamie. I cut

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.640
you off while I was ranting. I was just saying, you know, with the, the using the tags like that,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:05.280
like me, I mean, technically as a demigirl, I have been told that I fall under the trans group,

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:14.480
but I don't use it because I don't, I just don't feel like it's representative of me. I'm

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.840
borderline, you know, it's, it's, it's so weird. And that is a hundred percent your call to make.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.480
Exactly. Nobody makes that call but you. Exactly. Exactly. So, all right. So anyway,

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.200
um, I was using it as an example. I'm very curious to see what happens to some of these

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.680
other websites. Like the, um, I'm sorry, I forget. Is it the peer to peer? Was that the name of it?

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.200
The peer to peer? Yeah. That's the one that, uh, that I got accepted on. I'm kind of curious where,

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:46.400
where now that these tags are happening, does a site like that still kind of stick around for

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.320
the community they've built or are they going to evolve in some way? I'm just kind of curious.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.640
Like, I think it's still necessary and I'll tell you why. Um, and actually when I was streaming

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:02.400
last week and I actually kind of fussed at them because I thought it was a bot. Um, but actually

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:08.880
they have people who work with peer to peer who are going in to channels and doing promotion for

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:14.080
those channels for different people in the peer to peer network. Oh, like this one was like called

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:19.840
like businessman something. And, and I was like, Oh, somebody blocked this. Like, no, no, I'm only

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.480
half a bot. I'm actually really a person here, but, and so we, we talked about it and they're

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.000
like, yeah, we're promoting people who are on peer to peer so that, um, we can, you know,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.080
build up more of that acceptance and make sure that these people are given more of a voice.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.080
And I was like, Oh, well, well fine. Hang around. I'm cool with that. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.760
You know, okay. So like the literal sense of network that makes perfect sense and

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.920
clearly answers my question, how that is still totally relevant. Thank you.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.560
I found new streamers through peer to peer, just, you know, I've found games that I've,

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.360
you know, haven't heard of from watching peer to peer. Um, I've, I've really,

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.280
I've really been enjoying the service and I'm honestly proud to be a part of it.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.040
Neat. No, that's great. And thank you for, um, explaining that because now that you put it in

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.600
that light where it's like literally not just about like being on a directory, but the active

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.560
promotion of people that also agree to those, you know, rules that identify in these different ways

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.400
that are also on the directory. It's about that mutual promotion and benefit. Um, Oh yes,

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.920
I a hundred percent get that. Hello, VOG network. We, we kind of have, we're, we're a form of that

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.960
for like a different thing, like indie voices and stuff. Right. So like when you put it in that,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.360
uh, context, I'm like, Oh, okay. Oh, I guess so. It's like, it's like VOG, but this thing,

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.600
cool, neat. Well, and we may have some new VOG additions down the line, just saying,

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.280
well, we're still open to, you know, especially folks that want to do the Twitch thing. I mean,

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.360
yes, we have room for podcasters as well. Uh, and we have great shows that have been on our network

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.520
a long, long time that still do the audio only thing like British invaders. If you have never

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:59.840
heard me talk about them, they are a wonderful show that talk about British television and you

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.320
will find out about so many neat shows. You need to dig out of an archive and watch, uh,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:10.320
that just like how we got from, you know, uh, old, uh, older shows in the fifties and sixties

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.240
to now and somewhere it's, it's great. Um, and then we have, of course, shows that are on video,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.240
like us, Bobby anime jam session. Um, so yeah, my point was, um, we're always, you know, I've,

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.440
I've admittedly been very sleeping on a lot of this during the pandemic and some folks have even

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.400
reached out to me and I've just been kind of like, this whole thing has just been a lot.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.080
And like, honestly, status quo right now is an achievement. If I can be perfectly honest

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.400
throughout this pandemic status quo has been an achievement, but now that we're getting to the

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:47.760
other side of things, I I'm definitely need to go back on the motivation side of things. So,

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:53.680
all right. Yeah. All right. Dark soccer. We've been teasing this next story, the entire show.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:02.160
So let's talk about it. All right. So, um, I, um, I have incentive to play no man's sky,

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.000
which for the record, it's not going to run on my back. I have to see if I can run it in my

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.120
virtualizer. Um, but at any rate, um, there's a crossover with no man's sky from mass effect.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:20.480
And this lasts until the 31st. So time is indeed of the essence. Um, but basically you can do a,

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:31.760
uh, a mission that will let you, I guess, build the Normandy kind of, uh, acquire. Yes. You

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.360
basically call it, you, you call it the, as you play it, it, um, hints that there is like

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.320
something and there's very subtle hints through the whole thing where it's like, um, uh, something

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.800
that is called to action when it is most desperately needed. And as like mixed up with

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.280
radio interference and it says two worlds colliding coming together. So it's like hinting

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.120
that it's a crossover. And then when you finally finished the last thing and you put this beacon

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.440
out, it actually, it kind of like summons the Normandy into the orbit of the planet that you're

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.320
on. And you can go claim it for your own, um, your fleet. Would this be something I can do

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.840
as a new player? Yes, because they've put it in a new mode called expeditions, which is the mode.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.560
That's kind of like Diablo seasons where you start a new game. It's the only way you can do it. You

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.240
start a new game, uh, in expeditions mode and expeditions mode sets you up with certain stuff

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:27.600
to begin with. So, um, and another hint, the very first thing that you do in this is you build a car

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.040
that looks a lot like the Mako. It's the very first thing you do, uh, and you drive to where

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.680
your ship is at basically. How long did it take you to do about five hours of gameplay?

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.120
So keep that in mind too. You're in, you do have to put in the time. Um, you're not going to be

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:50.800
able to just go in there and, uh. So I could get it done tonight after my stream. Yeah. So, um,

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.400
as long as I'm not, I'm actually right now seeing if I can put it on my, uh, on my windows desktop,

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:07.200
my virtual desktop. So, um, but, uh, let's hear it for gigabit ethernet, but, but anyway, um, it's,

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.080
it's, it looks like it's really cool. Um, now I guess I probably should have just had you do this

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.440
story, Rob, because you've actually done this, but, um, like do you get to go inside the Normandy?

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.480
Is it the same? No. So, and I think they did this purposely because they knew that people would want

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.080
to go inside it and do all this stuff. And I don't think no man's sky engine is really built

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.440
for that. You can't use it as your own ship because the ships in no man's sky are very

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:37.280
individualistic. They're tiny little flying pods, um, to suddenly have the Normandy and all of its

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.040
crew and all that stuff doesn't really gel with the lore. So what they did is they made the

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:47.360
Normandy a fleet ship and fleets go with your, uh, frigates and the missions that you send those

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.160
out on, uh, you acquire different fleet ships to send out emissions. So Normandy is basically

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.120
becomes like a, an agent that you send out to do separate missions and, and come back and bring

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.320
you stuff. But it is like, it's an S class. It's the very best type that you don't see, uh, every

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:08.800
day. So that's interesting. Yeah. Um, also, and it's also worth pointing out because a lot of the,

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:14.160
the tweet focused on the ship and everything, you actually unlock other stuff. So as you're doing

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.720
the missions and you know, you, you make your way, you start to see more and more of what you get.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.640
And when you finish it all, you get titles, you get paragon, the paragon and the renegade. So

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.880
you unlock those titles. You actually get a sticker, uh, or like a, uh, uh, I forget what

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.240
they call them. Um, a logo, a splash, I don't know, but you get that, that you could put on

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:43.920
your base. So you get it and it just looks like the Normandy and you also get, um, something else

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:49.040
along those lines too, where it's like a art thing of the Normandy that you actually pick up and you

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:55.120
can use on your base. Now, are you stuck using this in your seasonal file? Because the expeditions

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.640
turn to regular games at the end of the expedition. Uh, and the answer is no, you're not limited to it.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:06.880
So once you claim that, or once you've finished your season stuff, you can go back in your main

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.560
game and you're going to summon the space anomaly. That's the hub that you're able to summon a little

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.040
ways into the story in the main game, in the season game, you can get it right from the start.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.480
Um, but you summon the space anomaly and in there is a vendor and he's the same one that had the

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.680
Twitch rewards from all those things during the first expedition. And you can, you talk to him and

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.880
he now has an expedition reward category and you can just pop the Normandy into your fleet from

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.280
there. Get your sticker, get your titles, get all that stuff that it gives you right off the bat.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:43.440
That's pretty cool. Yeah. Well, um, well I'm going to see if it'll run in my virtualizer. Um,

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:51.120
but, uh, if not, I guess that's what my steam link is going to be for, for my, uh, my PC that I'm

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.240
still looking at with slight loathing because of how often it would just restart.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.320
Bobby Black Wolf asks a great question in chat that I honestly don't know the answer to. And

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:09.120
that is, do we know if this goes cross platform, if you linked all your accounts? I don't know.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.600
But if I remember after the show and you may need to nudge me with a tweet, I will log into my steam

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.960
account and check out my no man's sky file there. I think I can get the space anomaly in my steam

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.440
account. If not, I'll just fucking play it again until I can. And I'll answer that question. So

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:31.200
I'll try to do it, um, because I actually don't know. Um, and that's a great question. And I

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.760
doubt anyone listening currently is crazy enough to own that game on multiple platforms like I do,

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.600
although I did not buy the Xbox one. I'm using game pass to do it. I only have it on steam,

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.000
but, uh, I think it is a great question that you're asking. So, um, I will try to remember

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
to do that after the show, but you may need to nudge me if I don't respond because I forget

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.840
things. So, all right. But yeah, it's an awesome collaborate. So it's so random, but I just,

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.760
it's so short. I wish, I wish they would have given at least till mid June. I get that it

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.000
doesn't take as long to finish, but I think you have a lot of people that haven't been interested

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.960
in no man's sky that are suddenly like, Oh, I want to fly up and around. Cause the nice thing is

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.720
dark soccer. And this is right up your alley. When the Normandy is just floating there in space,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:20.480
you can take your ship and you can fly all around it and underneath it and up close and over. You

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.680
can just like, you know, look at the Normandy from any direction you want. So that's awesome.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:32.640
Yeah, it really is. I love, I love the Normandy. Yeah, me too. All right. Um, let's move on

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:38.000
Loki. Something, something exciting in your world and your fandoms, right? Uh, yeah, absolutely. So

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.800
deep silver. Um, I mean, there's been rumors that there's a new time splitters game being worked on

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.840
for a long time. In fact, there's been several iterations with different companies that happening,

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.760
but now we've got something official actually coming. Um, thanks to deep silver. So deep

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:03.120
silver put out a tweet, um, announcing that deep silver studio is coming, uh, free radical design.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.760
So our new deep silver studio. And so they're bringing back free radical design, which actually

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.640
back in 2014, but they're bringing back the original like veterans, Steve Ellis and David

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.000
doke. And basically said, you've asked, we listen, we've been working on plans of bringing time

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.440
splitters franchise back to life and are pleased to let you know that we are doing just that,

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.400
uh, free radical designs is reforming and we'll be headed up by the industry and, uh,

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:36.480
time splitters veterans. Uh, this is exciting first step in the process. So I am super excited

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:43.840
about that. That is amazing. So I can't wait for a new time splitters game. I just, I hope they do

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.240
it justice for you, Loki. Cause sometimes they get the gang back together and it's like, Oh,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.240
you know, there's not much to the formula really. I mean, it's a, it's an FPS with like weird quirky

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.840
stuff in it. And I think it, I think that's a pretty easy bar to hit. I just think about,

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.760
I think about things like mighty number nine and I know that game had its fans and you know,

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.200
I don't, I don't, but yeah, you see that that was my reaction to Loki.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:13.120
No, I can, I see them being able to do it, especially if you have the original developers

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:19.040
on and stuff. I think it'd be fine. All right. Uh, orange right in chat says, I remember spending

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.080
some time in time splitters, one level editor, uh, as Joe and her to Matt says, we've been teased a

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.240
new time splitters game for awhile. I hope they pull it off. Yeah. I think that would be fun.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:32.720
Uh, now that they've got it. Well, cause before like that was with like, we've had like kind of

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:39.520
work in progress things that were being made by either fans or being made by studios that have

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:46.240
clone or closed down and stuff like that. So now that they have a publisher, they have a studio,

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.640
I think we're, and they've said, yes, we're making it. Um, it's a pretty good indicator that

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:59.440
it's coming. Yeah. All right. Um, well, let's move on. Uh, it'll probably be too soon to see

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.680
details on the time splitter game this summer. Um, but we know we're going to be getting a lot

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.240
of game announcements, uh, as we get closer to summer, of course, E3 is on the horizon

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.800
and there are other virtual events that are happening as well, including summer game Fest

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.240
is coming back this year. And we knew that for some time now, summer game Fest last year,

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:22.080
I think people were kind of happy it was there, but it was also kind of hard to follow because

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.560
summer game Fest was like four months long. Remember that like, it was like summer game Fest

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.800
is running from June to September. And it was like, that isn't really a Fest, right? Well,

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.960
it does seem like Jeff Keeley, who of course is the brains behind all of this. You know him from

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.280
his game awards show and all that. It does seem he's picked up on a lot of that feedback because

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.960
he he's kind of saying in some tweets that he put out this week, the basically like,

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.960
I get the feedback that people like to have this information dump kind of like at one time. And

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.000
that, you know, uh, it's, it's going to be like a memorable month. He says, you know, this will be

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.640
a memorable month of announcements and updates. So what summer game Fest is going to be, they're

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.200
going to have a kickoff. They're calling it kickoff live. They're not saying what they're

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.920
kicking off, but it's kind of like a wink and a nod. It's an E3 kickoff, but not officially

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.400
because E3 soccer games. Yeah, no, not that kind of get off, but E3 is doing a kickoff. Oops. Nope.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.520
No, they're not. As summer game Fest is doing a kickoff that may or may not be inspired by E3,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.080
Thursday, June 10th. And it's at 11 AM Pacific time, which, so Bobby was talking before the show,

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:32.080
Oh, we might co-stream this. Hey, go, go for it if you're able to, but I will unfortunately be

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.280
busy with my day job. And that is not the greatest time for that. But I, but I also understand it's

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.680
in line with a lot of the E3 stuff, which tends to be during the day as well. 30 publishers are

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.520
taking place, or excuse me, we're taking part in summer game Fest. Some that are not with E3,

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:55.600
including PlayStation, Blizzard, Devolver Digital. So maybe we'll get more on that game. You were

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.720
just talking about it. Electronic Arts, who's doing their EA play live thing still. So that's

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.520
kind of cool. Also, I don't know why, but Weezer is performing at the kickoff. Well, that's fun.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:13.120
I mean, Weezer's cool. Of course I look at the promo photo of Weezer and I go, Oh shit,

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:24.480
they got old. Oh shit. So did I. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. But sorry, I'm not being shady. I promise

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:31.280
Weezer's awesome. I'm just, you know, like, Oh shit, they got old. So did I. Apparently also

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.040
Jeff Keeley loves to do the co-stream stuff and allow that stuff, which I'm very thankful for.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.200
And I think that's a great way to do it. You're allowed to co-stream. Apparently you can even

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.960
co-stream the musical performance because it's a live performance. So it shouldn't hit any of

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:48.960
those, whatever, but it has the rights to do all that. It shouldn't. It's true. It's true.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:56.320
But it probably will. All right. So that'll be cool. I can't wait to, I mean, I can't co-stream

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.240
it, but I can work on a project while I have my earbuds in listening to it. I can do that.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.240
So that'll be cool. And I, so I look forward to listening to it when, when it all goes down on

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:16.400
June 10th. So let's see. RHM087 in chat says, will the Twitch stream have to have generic rock?

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.400
Well, that depends on what you consider Weezer. When I read that comment at first,

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.080
I thought it said geriatric rock and I was like, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:32.160
It's not the Rolling Stones. Okay. It's not, it's not ACDC. Okay. It's,

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.400
and I'm sorry if you love those bands. They're great bands, but if Weezer got old,

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:46.560
have you seen Aerosmith lately? Like, really? All right. He's melted a bit.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.480
All right. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, I was on mute. I was gonna say,

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.360
look at the Rolling Stones. Keith Richards has to recycle his blood.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:06.080
Oh, yeah. Right. Oh my gosh. And ACDEF says, I think RHM087 is talking about what happened

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.200
with Metallica at BlizzCon. You're right. I do remember that, how they replaced it with generic

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.760
rock. But let's remember, Metallica was at the forefront of screwing online music distribution.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.720
I realized they've come a long way, but that is a flag they're going to have to carry for

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.280
forever, basically, what they did to Napster back in the day. You can't help but think about that.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:37.280
I am confident enough that Jeff Keighley has thought of these sorts of questions

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.320
because he keeps tabs on things like when the Blizzard stream got muted and changed to the

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.360
generic rock. Like, Jeff Keighley, so I have confidence he's gotten all the contracts and

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:53.760
things that need to happen so that your Weezer songs don't get your stream a copyright strike,

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.320
which is great. There's a reason I make my own music.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.040
Yeah, I know. And that's been a great thing, too, is that like copyright strike myself.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:08.640
All right, let's move on. Funny they said that, but that's actually a legitimate strategy to get

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:16.160
past some of those copyright strikes in YouTube is a copyright strike yourself. That's so weird.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.560
All right, let's move on. Dar soccer. You have a very interesting story here.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.600
Yeah. So and this is kind of an important thing for me as someone who plays on things like stadia.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:37.520
But Netflix, honestly, is now looking for an executive. This is a report to head an expansion

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:44.720
into video games. The report says that they've reached out to multiple veteran video game

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.600
industry executives for the position. And this is kind of going along with what some other

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.040
companies did. Like Apple Arcade came out with a bundle of games and then has been pretty consistent

01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.440
with its updates. And, you know, we have stadia. We have Geforce Now. We've got those different

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:05.120
things. So it stands to reason that Netflix is going to want to get in on that action.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:10.240
And I'm pretty sure they can make it profitable. And on top of that, you know, they've also

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:18.080
did interactive video stuff like the Black Mirror Bandersnatch and the Kimmy Schmidt episode.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:25.360
And then they've also done series based off of video game properties. I mean, we had Castlevania.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.960
We had The Witcher. But and they've also produced games. There were the Stranger Things games,

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.720
which, of course, they also licensed out Stranger Things to behavior for Dead by Daylight.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:40.000
And the other thing, though, that's going on is that since Netflix subscriptions have slowed

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:48.480
down because of their production delays, that they've gone out and said in 2019 that their

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:58.480
biggest competition was Fortnite. So they're there. The fact that they would want to expand

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:07.920
into these other fields, especially for video game streaming, it really makes sense to me.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.800
I think it would be a wise move on their part, although they've got other established

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.120
outlets, you know, that are already going to be a step ahead of them.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.800
You know, it's interesting. You know, I know we're talking about kind of like literal games here that

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.280
Netflix might build into their game. But, you know, it's interesting. You know,

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.320
that Netflix might build in, you know, like literal games. And it would be interesting

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.240
to see how that's all delivered if it's through their app or how they how they get the game stuff

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:39.360
on all the televisions and stuff they support. But it's possible, probably with a very, you know,

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.640
like an Android, you know, type of base for all the games, it would probably work. But kind of

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.560
something you said there at the end made me think about like actual like video game streaming

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.960
content. And we talk a lot about how Twitch is really out here unopposed. I mean, yes,

01:30:52.960 --> 01:31:00.080
there's YouTube, but there's another one that went different. Yeah. Mixer that used to be

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:06.160
Beam back in the day. So, you know, wouldn't it be interesting if somebody like Netflix tried to

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:11.680
do like a Twitch thing, like maybe not necessarily letting anybody create content, although I'm all

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.840
about that. And I hope that is the direction a company that would choose to do that would do.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.200
But what if a company like Netflix tried to woo some of these big game streamers with large

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:27.920
audiences to create content for Netflix? That would be wild. It would be like a ninja type

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:31.840
thing that's on Netflix. I hate to invoke him because he's always the person that people talk

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:37.600
about. But there's a reason for that. You know, his streams are huge. So it'll be interesting.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:44.400
So it would. Yeah. But our HM 087 in chats is right now for me, Netflix's biggest competition

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.160
is YouTube. And there is that is because you and YouTube is basically free. You know, the ads.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:58.000
I have a paid YouTube premium account. Yeah, I think there's a thing with Google phones,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.160
too, where that like because I think Alan has like a premium account that he gets because he

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.960
has an Android phone of some type. So I don't know how that works. But yeah, yeah, it's interesting.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:13.040
So. All right. Well, on top of that, now, I think that for Twitch streamers,

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:19.360
I think once you make partner, you are allowed to stream to YouTube as well.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:27.440
Really? I don't know. I was reading something about doing multiple streaming. I mean, I only I

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.720
don't plan on doing any YouTube streaming. It's just the thing is, is that with Stadia,

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:35.040
it has an automatic ability to stream to your YouTube account if you want to.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a big thing they were selling in the beginning. Yeah.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.720
Yeah, which I don't want to do. Yeah. Interesting. All right. Well,

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:49.760
let's move on, Loki. You're muted, by the way, Loki, we can't hear you, so.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:56.240
Sorry, kids are yelling. So this is pretty cool. We had a mod that's been made for Red Dead

01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:04.480
Redemption 2 to add VR support in the sense that they add basically a point of view with VR.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.560
They're still working out the controls and everything, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is a

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:13.200
pretty gorgeous looking game as it is. So it makes for a very immersive experience.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:18.960
So this is coming actually by the guy that did the same thing, Luke Ross. He did the same thing

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:25.600
for Grand Theft Auto five. And right now you can only run it on really high end hardware.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:32.160
They're saying that he's basically tested it on just the top of the line, you know,

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:39.520
RTX 3080s and stuff. And it's still kind of not smooth yet, but it's still being worked on.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:48.400
But man, it looks pretty awesome. Like, I don't know that I would love to try that out someday,

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.480
but I don't have the hardware to run that. So I always think it's weird. I always think it's

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.960
weird when they inject VR into things that weren't really built for VR. But I also think like,

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.600
let's say a game like No Man's Sky where the developers admittedly were the ones that kind

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.600
of built that. They kind of made the game work well for it. I think No Man's Sky is a pleasant

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.440
experience in VR. I wouldn't want to play the game 24 seven in that way or like all the time,

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.000
but I thought when I did play it, I was like, damn, this looks good.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.200
It's been a long time since I played Red Dead Redemption 2, but I know like with Grand Theft

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.040
Auto 5, they had the first person view that you could do. I can't remember if they had something

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.840
similar that I am in Red Dead Redemption. If that's the case, then it'd be very easy to adapt

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:34.960
it to VR because you already have like that kind of same camera already set up. Maybe they do. I

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:41.600
can't remember because it's been, gosh, like over a year since I played the game. But yeah, I mean,

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:48.560
it looks pretty, pretty awesome. So yeah, hopefully it'll be developed a little bit,

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.120
you know, they'll work out the kinks with it and it'll be playable on something that's not so

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.320
screaming cutting edge right now, or, well, just wait a little bit longer and eventually it'll be,

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.760
you know, that won't be cutting edge anymore. So we'll have to wait and see.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.960
Something you're unable to acquire because of fucking scalpers, right?

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.680
So, uh, well, right. And that, and the fact that I use a laptop, so I can't update that

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.640
thing anyways. I got to buy a new one. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, moving on,

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.480
we have a story that talks about the Evercade system, which, uh, I think, uh, this is cute.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:29.200
I kind of want one. Like we, we, uh, brought it up before and I'm kind of like, oh, it's another

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.440
kind of retro thing. There's these, there's a lot of these out there. This is the one I was telling

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.360
you. Well, we, we talked about it a little bit before, but this is the one also that had, um,

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.080
some nest maker games on there. So they have several, uh, guys in the community that made

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:46.800
games, have their games published on this, which is awesome. That is I'm open. Hey, you want to

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:53.200
approach somebody? I got a phone. I'm waiting for it to ring. Well, um, right now, Loki,

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.120
they're a little busy because they're going to be doing some, uh, some, uh, not, not Indy,

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.760
but some other, uh, big publishers of the past, uh, doing some, uh, compilations there.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.840
They're gonna, um, be released on November 3rd, pre-order start May 28th. Uh, they're going to

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:14.080
cost 20 bucks, uh, or a 15 euros, if you will, uh, they are compilation cartridges, which include

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:21.760
Atari arcade one, uh, which has things like Pong warlords lunar Lander asteroids data East, uh,

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:29.200
which has bad dudes versus dragon Ninja burger time, uh, lock and chase chase, uh, chain reaction.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:35.840
Um, Jaleco arcade with, uh, alligator hunt, snowboard championship, world rally, and then

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.440
technos arcade, which has, uh, the combat tribes, uh, double dragon two and three. Um,

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.000
Dr. John's adventure. Oh, mysterious stones, uh, minke monkey. Some games I haven't even honestly

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.040
heard of to be real, but I love the idea of like these like super retro games in cartridges so

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.120
that you're not like accumulating all these little mini players that play like five games. You have

01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:01.840
one mini player and a cartridges. That's kind of cool. It's like a legit way to do it. So that's,

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:07.280
that's neat. Um, I, I, I'm kind of interested in one of these things and I haven't been for a long

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:12.560
time, so well, remember they also have the full, uh, console version of this that's coming out.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.640
That's going to play. They have two cartridge slots though. For example, if you wanted to

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.440
load up data East and you know, Atari or something like that, you can pop them both in and you have

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.560
all those games you can choose from on there. Um, so you can just have a larger library and

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.640
swap them out as you need to, but they also have the handheld version as well. It's available.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.960
Yeah. All right. Well, let's take a trip back down memory lane. It was a simpler to, Oh my gosh.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.360
Uh, I may have ruined it, but, um, well, you'll see it was the classic game of the week. Cause

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.280
I hit the wrong button that actually showed the game. So maybe you recognize it, but if you didn't

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.520
dark soccer is here to educate you on it. And I bet a lot of people didn't recognize that game.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.520
Cause this is, this is one that's for me, I, at least for me is a little bit more of a deep cut.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.920
I wouldn't have recognized it off that half a second clip. I just leaked through there.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.760
But dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.680
you guys should be checking this game out. Uh, dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.760
You're muted just FYI. I, I can't see your camera, but.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.600
Okay. Oh, there you are. Um, the game, the game is arrow fighters, um, which is also known as

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.840
Sonic wings in Japan. It's a vertically scrolling shooter that came out in arcades. Um, in 1992,

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:31.200
it was released by video system and it got ported over to the super Famicom in 1993.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:37.120
It was the first in this series, also a spiritual successor to a 1991 game called turbo force.

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.560
It's a basic shooter. Um, you know, you have your normal weapons, you can upgrade your

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:51.440
weapons with, uh, P items or rarer F items. Um, and then, uh, of course your maximum power level

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.600
does have a hidden ammo count. Um, which of course, uh, after you use that up,

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:04.480
you'll be reduced back to your previous power level. Uh, button two has a special attack. Um,

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:13.200
and, uh, it really, the thing that made this a little bit more famous is that it had a cast

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:20.080
of characters, which in 1992, wasn't really something that happened regularly in a shooting

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:30.080
game. So, um, it had, uh, from the United States, its character was called blaster Keaton. Um,

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:37.280
then player two was Keith Bishop. Um, then in Japan you had Hien and then Mao Mao for player two

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.880
Sweden, you had Kofl, the Viking, and then TB 10. And then for UK, you had

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:52.480
William Sid pride and Lord river and white and white. So yeah, you had your own characters,

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:59.040
each of them with their own special, uh, special plane. Um, well, of course, you know that the,

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.480
the two us ones, one was an FA 18 Hornet and the other was an F 14 Tomcat. Cause I mean,

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:13.120
hello. Um, but anyway, um, this was considered, um, according to game machine in Japan, uh,

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.480
the second most successful table arcade unit of the year. And it was the second most popular

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:26.400
arcade game at the time. Um, it did come out on the SNES, as I mentioned, GamePro gave it a pretty

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.160
negative review because it slowed down, uh, had slowed down issues in mediocre graphics and some,

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:38.800
uh, sound effects issues. The music in it wasn't super great. Um, it did also get an emulated

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:46.320
version in 2005 for PS2 for a, uh, Japan exclusive Oritachi Gessen Zoku series. Um,

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:57.280
it had a number of sequels that came out. Um, so, uh, uh, it looks like that, um, the main,

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:05.040
uh, designer Nakamura Shin, uh, did not like that they wanted to, uh, develop for Neo Geo

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.960
and wanted to make more vertical games like that. Um, but couldn't do it for a horizontal monitor.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:18.640
So he formed, uh, Saikyo P S I K Y O, um, and did samurai ACEs for their first game.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:25.840
Anybody's heard of that. So, um, at video system, however, uh, they did Aero Fighters 2,

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:30.880
Aero Fighters 3, both came out on Neo Geo. Sonic Wing Special, which was like a dream

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.160
match version was recent Sega Saturn implementation. Special was also reaped,

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:44.320
uh, into arcades as Sonic Wings Limited. And then, um, uh, Paradigm Entertainment developed

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.800
Aero Fighters Assault for video system. Um, and so, uh, of course, Sonic Wings Special and Limited

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:57.840
were both vertical monitor games. Um, Nakamura, um, who I mentioned earlier went on for Strikers

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:09.920
1945 Plus for Neo Geo. Um, so, uh, a popular culture thing is that, uh, John Green, um,

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:17.280
you know, who we know from mental floss, uh, and all that, um, in the Savannah airport mistakenly

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:28.160
read it as nerdfighters. Um, and so they, uh, they had nerdfighters and nerdfighteria as a

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.480
collective title for him and his brother's fan community. So I thought it was kind of funny.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:39.760
And then in 2013, uh, he was given an Aero Fighters arcade cabinet as a gift. Um, so the reason why

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:49.280
I am bringing this up is that the, um, the SNES copy of this can go for some bucks. Um,

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:58.240
on eBay on average for a boxed copy, I'm sorry, this one's an unboxed copy that has even been

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:05.440
scratched in on it is going for 1200. I think I have this game though. I really do. I have to

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:13.920
check. There's another one for 1700. Um, that is again, just, uh, just the cartridge. Um,

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:21.120
I haven't seen what one in the box goes for. I'm pretty sure I own this game and it does look like

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:30.000
there is now I am seeing one on another site though, that says new in the box,

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:39.760
US version retail for 40 bucks. So I don't know if it's like a legit one, but who knows,

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:48.960
but at any rate, um, you know, good luck. It is, uh, yeah, I don't know if this is legit. It

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.760
doesn't, it looks a little bit too clean to be legit. So I'd have to double check, but yeah,

01:43:53.760 --> 01:44:02.000
it is. Um, it's a game that's kind of hard to find. Wow. There you go. Yeah. I'm pretty sure

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.040
this is a repro. All right. Well, is that it? That's the classic game of the week. That's

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.240
the classic game of the week. I didn't have a lot to say about it, but I brought it up,

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:17.600
um, as one that for some reason it's going for money. Yeah. Boy. Oh boy. Yeah. And you're going

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.960
to have a lot of people checking their collections at home going, do I still have a cartridge?

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.640
Cause some folks recognized it in chat. Uh, not, not just from the starting screen,

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.840
but once you were talking a little more about it and we actually saw the gameplay, it was like,

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.840
oh yeah, there's, I've played this. So, um, that would be interesting if any of our listeners

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.800
happen to have this little gold mine sitting in their house. So good pick. Thank you. Thank you.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:43.520
All right. Classic game of the week. All right. Oh, I see that. Uh, Stella decided to join us.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.960
Loki's cat for those listening on the podcast picture. Uh, but Stella's decided to join us

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:54.160
there during the break. Oh, she looks so comfortable. I love it. I hate it. She's

01:44:54.160 --> 01:45:04.080
either comfortable or screaming. She has two moods. All right. Uh, well, I hate resting

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:10.000
and possum. I hate to make you move. Loki cause Stella looks perfectly comfortable,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.920
but, uh, it's time for rapid fire news. All right. So as we were just talking about,

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:22.560
um, red dead redemption two, it should be no surprise that we're getting granted thought of

01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:29.680
five on the Xbox series X and PlayStation five, three generations of consoles in the same stupid

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.200
game. Um, I love grant the thought of five, but dude, come on. Like, and this is not coming out

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:41.280
until November 11th. So that's, that's a long ways away. Like, can we please get something new,

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.320
please? I don't really want to play grand theft auto online. I just want

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.480
grand theft auto six, please. Can I have that please? Somebody put an interesting timeline

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:58.480
out that really shows that like rock star hasn't done that much in the past few years.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.840
They're making so much money off of grant the federal online. I guess so.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.000
Yeah. It's crazy. Games, games take longer to make, especially huge AAA titles with 4k graphics

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.680
and stuff. They're going to take longer to make. And I understand that. But when you like,

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:15.440
really see like what the weight is like now versus what it used to be, it's like,

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.200
where is grand auto six, but, but, but, uh, with that grant, that thought of five,

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:28.720
I want to say came out. Um, well, it was, it's been several years. Um,

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.680
was that 2015? No, that wasn't 25th, 2013. Yeah. It's been a while. It's been,

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:43.440
it will be eight years in September. So I think that's enough time to develop a grand

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.040
theft auto game considering that this one didn't take as long. Granted, they have gone through

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.960
multiple systems, but I just think that they're making so much money on credit auto online that

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.400
they just aren't really motivated to make another game. So, so if we're going to get a games that

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:03.520
just won't stop being made, where's my Xbox series X version of Skyrim. I mean, I guess,

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.560
I guess they have like the boost ups from the Xbox one X, you know, I guess there's that,

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.600
but that's, I guess where's my, where's my, um, series X version of Skyrim.

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:21.920
Um, soon I'm sure. Yeah. I think we'll see a remaster of Oblivion pretty soon.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:26.160
Oh, you do. Hmm. I think, I think Oblivion or, um,

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.680
I don't know, maybe one of the fallout games. We haven't remastered for yet.

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.480
Maybe they'll do a remaster of fallout four. Um, or, I mean, it'd be nice if they did new Vegas

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:42.560
or something like that, but like, Oh, whatever. You know what? I don't care. You know, Skyrim

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.720
though, like we give it crap because they keep re-releasing it, but that game is thoroughly

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.640
enjoyable every time I play it. I have no complaints whatsoever with that. Like I will

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:58.400
play that game a million times. Like it's no big deal. Uh, Zen monkey has a good, uh, comment in

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.280
her chat here over at, uh, Twitch TV slash VOG network who says, I don't think rockstar is taking

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:11.200
too long. I think consoles are just coming out too fast. Interesting. Yeah, I guess. And technically,

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:16.000
I feel like it's been the same rate, but I also get, I think it's more like the demands of what

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.640
the new consoles require. You know, if they want to make Grand Theft Auto six, a cutting edge,

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.360
beautiful, it's going to be a 4k game. That's going to take longer to make, you know? Yeah,

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.560
I guess I have to be patient and really I should probably give online another chance because they

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:36.560
have a ton of content out there. Like it really is, but I, I'm kind of old school in the sense

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:42.000
that I like, I like field expansions that they used to have, you know, with like single player

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.400
storylines and stuff. I don't necessarily like the con. I don't like the, the having to pay for

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:55.360
absolutely everything in Grand Theft Auto online, like buying stuff is fine, but paying to ensure

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:02.800
my car, paying rent for my apartment, paying to, you know, recent, it's just, it's a lot of like

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:08.560
grind that they purposely put in the game to make money. I just wish to get rid of it. Our chat room

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.320
is pointing out that in two more years, uh, Grand Theft Auto five will be eligible for classic game

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:18.160
of the week. Probably releasing yet another version of it. Rapid fire news. Whoops. Sorry,

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.480
I think the cat wants to leave here. Oh, okay. That's fine. It's, it's Stella's world. We're

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.480
just living in it. That's fine. I'm sure I was just going to sit here screaming at me.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:30.640
Yeah. Um, that's the listeners love it. They're like kitty, kitty, kitty. Yay.

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:37.840
So it's a letter screen. Yeah. All right. Um, and then of course, uh, Last of Us two is getting an

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.560
update on PlayStation five. They're going to be doing an enhancement patch to that, uh, kind of

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:50.880
similar to what we see on Xbox series X, where they're upping the FPS from 30 to 60. So that's

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:55.520
pretty awesome. And that'll be coming soon. Nice. All right. What do you have?

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:05.600
Uh, you're also muted. I've only been muting myself because I have curry rice. That's fine.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:11.680
Not eating in the mic is a good thing. Well, right. But sometimes, you know,

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:19.600
people got to eat. Um, so anyway, um, people have really, really, really, really, really

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.640
wanted the mass effect three multiplayer to come back. Um, and we know it's not there in the

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:32.320
legendary edition, but, um, uh, their project producer, Mac Walters in a CNET interview,

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:40.160
um, basically said he would never say no to it coming back in some form. Um, he's quoted saying,

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.320
we want to see what kind of reception the legendary edition gets and what demand for

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.040
the multiplayer is. And then we'll ask ourselves if we have the resources, the time to bring it up

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:55.920
to the quality level at fans one. So, uh, cool. I hope that happens. Make it cross-platform or

01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.960
don't bother. Right. In my opinion, I, my strong opinion, by the way, you'll notice, I didn't

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:05.040
mention mass effect my game a week. I I've put the game after, after everything that I went through

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:09.680
last week, my, my emotions on the show, I said, you know what I think is best right now. I'm just

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.400
going to put that game on hold. Like it's, it's a timeless trilogy. I'll love it. When I play

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.600
through it, I'll play through it in a couple months. Like once a lot of these patch issues

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.160
and all that crap gets sorted out, then I'll play it, you know, I, why, why do I need to play it

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.840
right? Right. Now, you know, I discovered mass effect as a trilogy late. I didn't discover it

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.840
in 2007 when the first game came out or whatever it was, I discovered it way later. So you know

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:39.120
what? Cool. Anyway, but I w I would be down with multiplayer, don't get me wrong. Uh, and I think

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:43.360
it's the there's money in it for Bioware cause you know, they, they could charge for the packs

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:50.720
and things like that and they'll get their money. Um, but we'll see. Yeah. So at any rate, um, now,

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.920
and this is something I don't know that we brought up on this show, but it's definitely something

01:51:53.920 --> 01:52:01.920
that's impacted a lot of, a lot of, uh, manga and video game fans is, uh, Miura Kentaro, who was the

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:08.800
mangaka behind Berserk died at 54. And of course we know we've had a couple of Berserk games. There

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:15.440
was the one on dream cast that came out in the U S uh, a while back called out. You, you've done

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.800
one as classic game of the week way back when, but one of them you highlighted. Yeah. I know,

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:26.640
but what, as I was saying, um, uh, it had BJ ward is one of the voice actors in it. And, uh,

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:33.920
God, why can't Michael bell as guts? Um, so two Voltron voice actors. Um, but at any rate, um,

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:40.800
because, uh, one of the final fantasy 14 classes, the dark knight was heavily influenced by the

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:48.640
character of guts. Um, uh, in one of the servers, um, I'm trying to see what server it was.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:57.360
Um, uh, Balmung, um, in old doc, they had a bunch of dark nights, just standing

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:02.320
in a row with their pose with the, with their ginormous sword over their shoulder.

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:09.280
Um, to, uh, to pay tribute to his passing. Um, and the same thing was happening as some

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.520
of the other servers as well, just different, similar vigils. Um, but yeah, the, since the

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:21.680
dark knight was, you know, really inspired by guts, who then, um, of course, Mira had a lot

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:27.040
to do with that. Of course, his mark has shown up in many other character classes and games.

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:33.920
So, uh, and you know, the other sad thing for me is that this means berserk is never going to,

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:43.680
to have an ending. It actually, the last arc left off in berserk that I was reading had Casca

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:51.680
getting her, uh, her, uh, personality and memory back, but with a big, uh, hitch in her relationship

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:57.600
with guts. So I don't know if we're ever going to see that end if he's left any kind of successor.

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:04.160
So I don't know what'll happen. Um, Balmung, by the way, I think is probably still the biggest

01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:08.000
Final Fantasy 14 server. There's like a ton of people that are on it. A lot of role-play stuff

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.280
that happens there. So I'm kind of not surprised that this, uh, happened on that server. So,

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.960
all right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and talk about some

01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:22.080
games that are coming out this week. We'll start in the U S Loki.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.600
All right. So we have bio mutant on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC,

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:36.320
Capcom arcade stadium on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, final fantasy 14 on

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:42.800
PlayStation five. Oh yeah. There's a big patch on Tuesday and the official release is this week.

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:49.520
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, King of the seas on a PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one,

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:16.160
uh, earth defense force world brothers on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

fighting ex slayer, another dash on Nintendo switch, uh, Mac warrior five mercenaries on

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:31.440
Xbox one and Xbox series X super Bomberman are online on PC into the switch and PlayStation four

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.800
tente Boku Metsu on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

Warhammer age of Sigmar storm ground on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

And let's see song of horror PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, the world world's end club

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:58.960
on Nintendo switch. And finally wonder boy, Asha in monster world on Intel switch and PlayStation

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.840
four. That's a busy week, but also, um, probably with the summer on the horizon, a lot of folks

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.720
getting out of school and stuff. It's a, it's usually, usually this week before summer, so to

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:14.000
speak is a huge release window. So I'm not too surprised. Um, quite a few things coming out in

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.120
Japan as well, maybe not quite as crowded, but still, uh, on the Nintendo switch paradigm paradox,

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.360
uh, comes out on may 27th, as well as a limited edition for that, uh, tente Boku Metsu comes out

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.320
as well. Uh, world's end club gets a release and it's in English. Um, but that is still being

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.360
released in Japan. Uh, so you have that to look forward to as well as liberated, same thing going

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.760
on there. Uh, you also have man eater gets it's released in Japan this week. That is also on the

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.280
switch heading over to the PlayStation five. Uh, they'll say just one game Terminator resistance

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:51.040
enhanced. So there's that on the PlayStation five and for the PlayStation four this week,

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:57.280
uh, you have, uh, tente Boku Metsu is out there as well. Uh, the last of us two gets a price

01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.560
reduction, uh, on PlayStation four this week. Biomutant is out this week as well in Japan.

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.560
And, um, I think that is about it. How about the UK dark soccer?

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.840
We have a few things on the 25th. We have Shin Megami Tensei three Nocturne HD remaster.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:21.440
Um, also in the 25th, we have man-eater for switch, um, Biomutant for PlayStation, Xbox,

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:29.520
and, uh, PC. On the 27th, we have Asterix and Obelix, the XXL collection, um, for PlayStation

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:35.120
and switch on the 28th, we have instant sports tennis for switch and also for the switch port

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:43.920
Royale four. All right. That's it. Then we'll move on to some more stories. Uh, Loki, I think

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.000
you have our next story. Yeah. So we had, I think it was last week, Sony saying that they weren't

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.080
sure they're going to be able to meet the demand with PlayStation five. And you know,

01:57:54.080 --> 01:58:01.200
Nintendo's like, Hey, hold my beer. Um, they're basically saying that they're also uncertain that

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:08.800
they're going to meet the insane demand of the Nintendo switch. Um, so apparently, you know,

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.080
they've sold a lot and the demand is still too high. Uh, right now they said they have ads for

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.320
production. We've achieved steady hardware production through the end of the last calendar

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.280
year. And as a result in the previous fiscal year, we set a record of our highest fourth quarter

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.880
sales volume. Meanwhile, the demand for hardware continues to exceed our expectations. Even the

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:33.600
beginning of this calendar year and production has currently not caught up to this high demand

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:40.560
due to tight supply and demand for semiconductor materials worldwide. So they're, they're trying,

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:51.120
but you know, the shortages they're affecting everyone. Um, gosh, there's, uh, um,

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:56.480
there's just a bunch of shortages that they're still expecting through this year. Like with the

01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.120
whole PlayStation five, I think the graphics card things come out like this with all these, you know,

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.000
microchips and things, and just a lot of the stuff, you know, cause, and, and COVID honestly,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.240
because even though COVID is in one kind of place here in the U S that's not what the rest of the

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.200
world looks like. So there's that as well. And, um, yeah, it's just, uh, it's not going to be a

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.680
pretty year for a lot of those holiday things. So, uh, you know, like I said, I don't, I still

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.320
don't have a PlayStation five. I don't know if I'm going to get one this year because of all this

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.160
otherwise around the winter time, I might be interested in getting one, but I just don't see

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:35.520
it actually happening sadly. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, well moving on and, um, speaking of,

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:41.520
uh, you know, um, the reality that COVID is still, still alive and well in the U S as well as many

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:48.720
parts, many parts of the world. Um, a lot of folks have noticed, uh, uh, Diego, uh, who is a, uh,

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.920
fighting game professional gamer. He's pretty well known in those, uh, communities, um,

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:58.960
has just been released from the hospital, uh, in a tweet, uh, on his account, Diego, the beast,

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:03.520
he wrote after nearly two weeks of treatment today, I was released from the hospital,

02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.480
extremely grateful to the nurses and doctors for their devoted care, many thanks to my fans and

02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:13.040
colleagues for the warm support. It will take time to get back to normal, but I'm so glad I'm

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.960
recovering. So, uh, it sounds like, uh, from what I was picking up on, um, he actually got like a

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:25.200
pneumonia as a result of COVID. And that is a very, um, scary situation. Um, I had a friend

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:29.520
many years ago and some of you might remember this on the show. Uh, she had swine flu and got

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:34.880
pneumonia as a result of that and she passed away. Uh, and she was only 24 and that was horrible.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.000
My friend actually is still in the hospital and still on a ventilator. Oh no, I'm sorry to hear

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.400
that. Every time she's more responsive and every time they've tried to take her off the ventilator,

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:51.040
she's suffered for it. So she's still on. Um, but she went in with pneumonia and had COVID as a

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:57.840
result. Um, and she also had some kidney problems that were really highly exacerbated by it. So

02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:05.120
she's been on dialysis. Oh my gosh. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm afraid

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.480
for her, whether she recovers or not, she's going to be wheelchair bound after this.

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.440
Yeah. Oh gosh. Well, still sending my thoughts, um, her way and hoping, um,

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.560
all can go as well as possible in this situation. So, uh, everyone just send KK to your love.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.360
Um, now act-def talking about Daigo and the tweet that I was reading here, uh, we owe a lot,

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:32.800
uh, to Daigo on fighting games and competitive games getting mainstream. Um, and, um, yeah,

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.200
I mean, it's, it's, you know, to hear that this is still going on and, you know, to people that we,

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.880
you know, follow respect admire, it's just kind of a reminder. So even though, yes, you know,

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.040
vaccines are doing some amazing stuff here in the States. And I think, you know, I mentioned,

02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.320
we're taking next week off and I think a lot of people are going to be kind of celebrating over

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:55.600
the long weekend. I think it's still a reminder. You got to still take some sense of precaution,

02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.720
especially if you're not vaccinated, if you're not vaccinated, um, you really owe it to other

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:05.920
people to still protect, uh, people from potentially getting the virus, you know? So,

02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.320
um, you know, take precautions and let stories like this be a warning. You don't want this to be

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:16.880
you. So, because it never happens to you until it does. And then why did it happen to me? Anyway,

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.600
all right, moving on. Uh, we have another story, which I think is Dark Sakura's.

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:30.400
Let me unmute now that I have taken a sip, um, or taken a bite. So this is kind of cool. There

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:42.880
is an old school Xbox Easter egg that people have found after 20 years. Um, so, uh, basically, um,

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:47.600
well, and it actually, it was disclosed by the developer, um, one of the developers who worked

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:55.360
on the Xbox, um, basically because it had never been found, he said how to do it. So you'll need

02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:03.120
to, uh, rip a CD to your Xbox hardware. And when you're prompted to name the album, you type in

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:11.760
Timmy with 26 Y's and an exclamation point. It's pronounced Timmy. It is, but I am

02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:21.200
spelling it out anyway. Um, what happens after that is that, um,

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:29.760
it will show you a different credit screen, uh, in the system information option, uh, that will,

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:37.360
uh, list members of the Xbox dashboard team. So that's pretty cool. They, um, also in response

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:42.640
to this Seamus Blackley, who is also an amazing Baker extraordinaire, and I have learned a lot

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:50.160
from him, um, has, uh, actually reached out and told Kotaku that he wasn't aware of the

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:56.080
that he wasn't aware of that Easter egg, but he says there's at least one last surprise the Xbox

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:02.720
fans have not found, and he's not going to tell you how to trigger it. Oh, good luck.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.160
Yeah. Has anyone, has anyone tried entering Cartman in the disc ripping stream? Uh, which

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.880
I totally forgot the Xbox would rip, uh, audio discs. I totally forgot that that was the thing

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.040
until I was seeing the story myself and I was like, oh yeah, that was the thing you could do.

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:25.200
Like, I think I, I think I ripped the Echo image album from back in the day, uh, you know,

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.280
DDR and all that stuff. I think I ripped that to my original Xbox because you could, you could play

02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:35.920
games with music like that was ripped to the, um, uh, system. It's kind of neat. So anyway,

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.080
that's cute that we're finding all these Easter eggs. What, literally 20 years later as, uh, you

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:46.080
know, Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox. So it's kind of fun for sure. That's pretty cool.

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:52.560
Meanwhile, on the Sony front, what do we have Loki? Some weird stuff, you know? Uh, so the,

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:59.040
apparently back when Epic was testing the Unreal three engine on the PlayStation three,

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:06.640
they had built some kind of proof of concepts to basically, um, test out the engine on the hardware

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:14.480
and some of the things that they did were port, um, I unreal over to the PlayStation three. And

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:20.720
also they also have a version of gears of war three that runs on the PlayStation three.

02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:28.320
And well, thanks to a digital archivist, uh, by the name of pixel butts, he has decided to, uh,

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:37.360
release the, the demo, um, out to the internet archives. And, um, now you're not necessarily

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:41.760
going to be able to run this on PlayStation three hardware only runs on a dev unit, but I think

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:48.320
through emulation, you might be able to do some of it. Um, right now though, or you could just

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:55.680
get it on your Xbox. It's literally the same game. Right. But it, it's forbidden now to play it on a

02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:00.000
PlayStation three. So you're doing something you're not supposed to do. Yeah. Right. So

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:06.320
apparently though, it's not optimized obviously. And, um, it does have several caveats to get it

02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:14.400
run. Uh, the emulator only can reach the title screen, but, um, I guess if you happen to own

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:19.760
a dev piece of hardware for PlayStation three, you can see a title screen. No, no, no. You can

02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:24.480
actually play the game. Oh, okay. Emulator can only get to the, Oh, got it. Got it. Got it. Okay.

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:31.040
Yeah. So neat. Although not when you put it in the context of Epic was testing the unreal engine on

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:34.400
PlayStation and this is what they used to do it. It's actually kind of like, Oh, okay. Well that

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:38.800
actually totally makes sense. Even if this game that they were making was, uh, you know,

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:46.720
an exclusive to Microsoft. So, uh, interesting. All right. Uh, less interesting and actually

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:51.760
kind of pissing some people off has to do with a new Amiibo that's coming out for Zelda Skyward

02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:56.640
sword. Uh, and of course, Skyward sword HD is coming out what in July? And there's going to

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:02.480
be a new Amiibo that comes with it, a Zelda and loft wing Amiibo. And, uh, it's putting a feature

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:07.840
in this Amiibo. So it's not unheard of that like Amiibos do like interesting weird things in the

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:13.600
game, but this one's almost a little bit more because it actually allows you to zip between the

02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:19.600
games airborne overworld and Hyrule surface, uh, which was not something that was available in the

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:25.440
original game. Um, it's a time saver. So, you know, uh, we've been talking a little bit about

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:31.200
summer games done quick and, uh, you know, Bobby's very involved with that and has been, uh, promoting

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:38.080
that coming up in a few weeks. This could do a lot for speed running, but it's an Amiibo and it's

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:43.600
something that you have to buy. Basically not only is it an Amiibo only functionality, by the way,

02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:50.720
this Amiibo is $10 more than your normal Amiibo. It's $25, not 15. Well, I mean, it's not the first

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:56.000
time that Nintendo's put out a more expensive Amiibo because like, uh, that giant Yoshi egg,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:03.440
Yoshi yarn thing, that was like a $40 Amiibo, but it was a giant one. I mean, this one, I think it's

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:06.960
a little bigger and it's a little more detailed, but still, I mean, you can't help, but kind of

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:12.000
raise your eyebrow at what's going on. Oh, and by the way, they wonder why people pirate those

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.280
Amiibos then. Yes. And by the way, because this sold out, this, uh, the feature, this more, they

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:27.840
sold out instantly, uh, gone in the UK, the U S you name it, scalpers bought them up. So, um, yeah,

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:36.480
I, uh, I, I want to, you know, as much as I do not like to endorse piracy here on the show, I think

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.520
this is one of those situations where we need to remind people, uh, it is possible to make your own

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:49.840
Amiibo, uh, not saying you can make it with the, um, the, um, uh, figure and all that stuff, but you

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.640
can actually, if you want to unlock this feature, there is a way you can do that. Look, you know a

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.480
little bit more about this, right? It's like, you can actually create your own ARFID tags and all

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:04.240
this stuff, right? Yeah. So you, you basically, you buy these tags that are like on Amazon or eBay or

02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:10.560
whatever you just buy the specific, um, RFID tags. And then what they normally do is they will store

02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:16.400
them in like, it's like a sticker almost. And then people will buy like, um, they're like coin

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.440
collector cases. And so it's like a little coin and you basically print out artwork for it and

02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:26.000
stuff and stick the sticker on there or like poker chips or something like that. So something small,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.040
but basically it's a sticker and there's people online that will read, or you can actually read

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.320
your own Amiibo, um, using just like an Android phone and there's an app, an APA APK you can

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:41.840
download to it that you can run and basically copy or download Amiibos to these tags.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:46.160
Have a whole binder of these. Yeah. You can have like, you know, basically

02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:53.200
50 tags, I think are like 20 bucks. I have all these animal crossing cards too.

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:58.640
Yeah. So it's, it's basically, it's like that in a lot of people leak them online,

02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.720
especially if it's something hard to find like this, it'll be online. It'll be online

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:08.400
immediately. And so you can just, you know, download it. And then eventually if you stop

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.800
playing, you know, this game, then you can download another one to it.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.080
And again, this isn't a topic I enjoy discussing here on OLR, but when they put these kinds of

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.600
features away in the game and scalpers end up getting everything, um, and that's the person

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.040
that's going to get hurt. I don't think Nintendo is going to get hurt as much by this as scalpers

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.040
will because, Hey, Nintendo sold all their inventory, but the gamers would like to still

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.080
be able to, uh, have the feature. So as far as I'm concerned, fuck them. And I mean, scalpers,

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.520
fuck them. Like, you know, okay. Thanks for giving Nintendo money so we can have a feature.

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.560
I guess, although I'm not the biggest fan of the implementation, don't get me wrong.

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.640
But at the same time, if these amiibo were more readily available, I probably wouldn't be having

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.240
this discussion right now. We'd probably be having more of a discussion about, well, should they be

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:57.760
charging so much money? Shouldn't they have other ways to unlock this feature and so forth. But,

02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:05.600
um, as far as I'm concerned, uh, make your own amiibo. Who cares? So, yeah. All right. Anyhow,

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.960
let's move on and get to the listener round table. And this is the part where we, uh,

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:16.000
get you guys involved with the show, uh, via, um, your emails and any chat questions you might have

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.560
over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, uh, we'll get some of your discord comments as well.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:24.400
There's some good stuff throughout the week this week. So, uh, we have some emails, I think

02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:28.800
tonight though. So we'll start with dark soccer and, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:35.600
If you want to send an email for a future week. We do. So, uh, first email comes from Robert M.

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.440
I would love to see the enhanced me editing features in Miitopia for the switch patched

02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:47.600
into smash ultimate and use for later games that use me such as Mario golf, super rush.

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.440
Would this be a good idea or bad idea? It's an idea.

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:55.600
Why not? Um, I, you know, thank you for reminding us that Miitopia came out this

02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:59.600
week cause I plum forgot. Um, but I know Bobby was talking a little bit about it on his show

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:04.000
tonight. I guess they have a very robust demo that came out for it. Um, so maybe I'll check that out

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.080
at some point. Um, but yeah, why I think people love to have fun with those means, of course,

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.760
they love to make, um, you know, celebrities and things they shouldn't be making in there and,

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:16.000
and, you know, scandalous things. But I think it just kind of shows that people,

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.160
people have fun flexing their creative muscles with this stuff. Why shouldn't we put it in some

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:25.280
of the other games like smash brothers and stuff? I think it's fun. Um, so yeah, why not? But I will

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:31.120
Nintendo do it. I, although, you know, with as much shit as we give Nintendo, like in that last

02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:36.320
story, I will say Nintendo is very good at supporting their products long after launch.

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:41.840
Um, and you know, putting out DLC literally years after the fact or something like the Mario party

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:48.640
story, like finally online years after the fact, but it's here and it's no extra cost. So hooray.

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.040
Um, so never say never, but I also don't know if Nintendo would be interested in really,

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.400
you know, going back and messing with, um, smash brothers, but they're still doing DLC.

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.040
So it's not like, it's like a game that's completely, you know, in the archives at

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:06.000
this point. So never say never. Um, but I think you, your suggestion is sound. Why not?

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:15.280
Yeah. Why not? So, um, next email. Sure. In honor of mental health awareness month,

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.680
how have you personally grown through gaming? And this is, this comes from D.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.080
This is a heavy question. Thank you for the question though. I think it's important to

02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:28.640
talk about, um, but, uh, maybe not everyone necessarily wants to, you read the question

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.400
one more time in chat, pay attention. If you're willing to share, I'd love to read some of your

02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.240
responses as well. I'm not sure we're all going to have one, but, um, if you could read the question

02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.840
one more time, dark soccer in honor of mental health awareness month, how have you personally

02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:49.680
grown through gaming? Um, for me, and I've talked a little bit about this on the show in the past,

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.960
but like when I was young, um, and I'm talking like fourth, fifth, sixth grade,

02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.480
I was bullied a lot because I was a little more effeminate than a little more nerdy than some,

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:07.360
uh, other kids my age. Um, but video, so it was this weird thing where I would get picked on by

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:15.840
other kids, but because I played video games, then those bullies would try to talk to me later when

02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.640
nobody else was around and ask me for video game tips. So it was this weird thing where like the

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:29.200
fact that I was such a gamer and I played video games made bullies show another side of themselves

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.480
to me. It was very strange. Um, but that's just like this weird thing that I grew up with because

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.720
of games. I know that's like really, really old, but obviously this formative years were like huge

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:45.520
on my mental health and so forth. Um, and, um, it's easy. I also kind of think of the times

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:52.800
when I was younger and I'm talking like 22, 23, probably just before the show started,

02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:59.440
I came out as gay when I was in my 20, when I was 20. Uh, and so those first few years, you know,

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.200
and then like, you know, OLR started four, four years later. But in those first few years,

02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:08.320
I found a lot in the gay community that like, it was like a lot of like judgment

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:14.000
and stuff when I was a gamer, it was like, oh, you play video games. Like, and it was, if it,

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.560
you know, it was hard to get a date because it was like, oh, I don't know fashion. I don't know,

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.080
uh, you know, the latest, uh, I'm not trying to be stereotypical, but these are like things that

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:30.400
I faced back then is it was like, I am like a nerdy type and that wasn't desirable. Now,

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.880
the nice thing isn't what, you know, your question is, is a little bit more of a positive and how I

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:40.480
make this a positive is that I really do see us now all these years later, haven't done this show

02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:46.080
for 20 years before. I think a lot of that is getting better, but to tie it back to something

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:52.400
else we talked about earlier in the show, it's because people like me have been able to find my

02:15:52.400 --> 02:16:00.080
tribe. And that's why the tagging in that shit is so important. Like I'm living proof, you know,

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:07.760
and now I'm in this position where I actually have it kind of good, you know, as a, as a cis white

02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.480
gay dude, you know what I mean? So I have privileges that a lot of other people are

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:17.760
still trying to, you know, find their tribes and, and, uh, work together to, uh, you know,

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.960
educate the rest of society on, you know, these, these other issues. So anyway, that's kind of why

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:27.040
I bring that up is I do think that that was something where gaming, but I never, I never

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:33.040
apologized for it either. I never tried to be something I wasn't, you know, like, I liked games

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:38.400
deal with it. People should just always be themselves and you'll find the, you know,

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:45.200
the right people when you're your authentic self, uh, reading some comments from chat,

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:49.200
and then I'll go to dark soccer and Loki. If they have anything they want to add, um, pod culture

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.320
says animal crossing has helped me with calming from anxiety. Gaming in general has helped with

02:16:54.320 --> 02:17:00.720
my depression. Um, act deaf says, I think video games helped me socialize more. I was a really

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:06.240
shy person still am kind of, but making connections through gaming allowed me to speak up to others.

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.880
Oh, this, you know, you don't talk mental health gaming has been critical during this pandemic

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:17.760
critical. I w I would not have made it if I couldn't play MMOs with people online or, uh,

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:22.320
animal crossing and this stuff, you know, like I, I think they've been more important than ever

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:25.920
with everything that we're going through. Um, Jamie, do you have anything you want to add?

02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.320
You don't have to, but I want to give you guys an opportunity. Gaming was always my outlet

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:36.080
and I learned a lot through it. And honestly, I've never made any apologies for being a gamer.

02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:41.680
Yeah. Um, certainly coming to doing this show is really given me thicker skin.

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:48.480
Yeah. You know, um, and you obviously you've had to deal with that in a way that Loki and I don't,

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:52.640
I've, I've gotten, you know, I just a little bit over the years I get the whole, you know,

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:56.640
you remember when we would get the email that would be like, you're so Rob, you're so cool,

02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.440
but I wish you would look to Jesus to, you know, uh, with your lifestyle, you know,

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:07.520
all that kind of stuff, which it's unfortunate, but, um, my answer is no, I'm not gonna change

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:14.000
who I am. Uh, and no, no thing that you, uh, you can believe all you want about all that,

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:21.760
but like I, my maker made me who I am period. So anyway. Um, and, uh, yeah. So anyways, but,

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:27.360
but you dark soccer, you've had to, you know, you get the real trash bag. Well, more so in the past

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:31.360
though. Again, I think that's a, well, I'm not to, not to dismiss or say it doesn't happen at

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:36.960
all, but you, I think you would agree. It was a lot worse than the earlier years before more women

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:44.720
were podcasting. Let's be real. It's just a matter of, I'm trying to think of how to phrase it,

02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:52.080
of sticking to your guns and staying authentic. Um, let me get some more chat comments. Uh,

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:56.000
DJ Rama S says one game got me through a very bad time in my teenage years.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.920
That game is secretive manna. I was, that was an incredible game. Um, I'm sure, you know,

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:06.640
how it applied for you in that situation was very different from how it applied for me. But

02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:12.800
I think that game means a lot to a lot of different things to many people. Um, SSU 100 Matt says,

02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.680
but personally gaming has helped me manage stress and help me get out of my downtimes in my life.

02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:21.680
Sometimes the distraction and working on constructive in a different media has helped

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:27.120
me get out of my own head and out of depressive times. Interesting construction and creativity

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.400
and that sort of thing. I, I, we hear that a lot. Um, pardon me, one more comment here. Um,

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:39.040
meshkins in our chat says this show along with gaming has helped me discover myself and who I am

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:45.920
and I'm slowly coming into myself and who I am as a person that is, um, I don't know if there's

02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.400
a better compliment somebody could give us about this show. So I just thank you so much for that.

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:54.960
And when people say, you know, even though just earlier in the show, I was like, I don't know

02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:01.520
how this show gets past 20 years. When I think of things like that, then I kind of go, I probably

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:10.960
got another five years in me. Am I right? You know, so, um, thank you for that. All right.

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:14.880
Anyhow. Um, uh, Loki, I don't want to skip you. Do you have anything you want to add?

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:19.440
Oh, I just met lots of people through gaming, but I don't think it's really,

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:26.160
I don't know. I don't think it changed. Fair enough. Fair enough. I guess, but,

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:29.520
but it's, it's mental health in the way that again, it's finding, it's finding your people,

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:33.200
it's finding your tribe. It's, it's, it's the same thing, even if it's in a different way,

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:37.680
you know? True. Yeah. Yes. I guess that makes sense. Yeah. All right. Um, thank you for the

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:43.200
email for, for such a short succinct email. That was a hard hitting, but really good question. Um,

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:47.600
and it's important. We talk about mental health. Uh, we've, we sure talked enough about COVID.

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:52.080
That's a physical health thing. Why don't we talk about mental health as frequently?

02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:55.920
It's good to know. Yeah. All right. Anyway, uh, is there more, I think there's at least one more,

02:20:55.920 --> 02:21:03.840
right? Um, yeah, just one more. So, um, and this comes from our own Rama. Hey Rob,

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:08.880
oh, it's for you. Okay. Um, I, I had mentioned before that I may know the reason why patches

02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:12.960
for console games are huge. You might think it's crazy, but please bear in mind the company I used

02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:19.280
to work for. Okay. Most Xbox games are run in a virtual environment as a disc image, especially

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:24.800
the Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are backwards compatible. So what companies do is patch the

02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:29.600
game and upload it so that if the game you bought has a patch, it will still be, it will still

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.400
download the game instead of copying the disc. But the disc still will be the license key to

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:39.840
play the game. This is done so that the console doesn't have to run any commands to patch the game

02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:44.640
in case the patching goes wrong. Um, and given your recent issue with Mass Effect,

02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:50.240
legendary edition EA screwed up the patching on that. And if you notice Sony does something

02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:55.760
similar with PlayStation games, I know that sounds crazy, but companies feel it's easier that way,

02:21:55.760 --> 02:22:00.720
but they don't realize the burden it puts on those data caps. I hope this answers your questions.

02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:05.760
If not, let me know and I'll see what I can do game on y'all DJ run mass. No, he said it right

02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:09.920
there at the end. They don't realize the burden that they're putting on us normal people with

02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:15.840
data caps. Bingo. That was it. So I'm, I'm, but, but as far as like your explanation and stuff,

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:20.160
it doesn't make sense, but I, you know, because I'm pretty sure most of the times all the disc

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:26.320
is doing, especially now on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, where the whole solid state drive

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:31.200
is part of the experience. You can't do that from a disc. So yes, it pulls down the whole disc and

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:34.960
basically like, or, you know, the, the parts that it needs and basically puts it on your drive.

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:39.600
And that disc at that point is just how you unlock and play it. Uh, so that the game knows

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.040
you still have the license rights to be able to use it. All of that makes perfect sense.

02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:48.000
Why can't the patching just patch the parts that have already installed my hard drive? That's I,

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.960
and that's what they're all missing. Um, I, and I get what you, I, again, I understand what you're

02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:58.160
saying, but at the same time, I just wish they would approach it differently so that it can be

02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:05.360
more respectful of that whole thing. Yeah. All right. Any other emails? All right. No.

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:11.600
All right. Um, let's get into, uh, Bobby does point out some patches are large because the

02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:16.800
files on your hard drive are compressed. Interesting. You know, steam takes forever

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:21.520
to patch things like dead by daylight. And I always thought it took so damn long because it

02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:26.960
was uncompressing, patching, compressing. And honestly, if I have to wait longer to have that

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:32.240
experience on console for smaller patches, I'm more than happy to take it. But I get the consoles

02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:36.800
are probably a little more confined with the drive space. It just, it just sucks. Can I just

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:43.920
sit here as a gamer and say, it sucks. I don't like it. All right. Um, Hey Shad, Starsix in

02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.840
chat. You missed, you missed the birthday shout out earlier. I'm not doing it again,

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:53.040
but I hope you had a good one. Uh, Shad, Starsix in chat and says, why is resident evil eight such

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:58.640
a good game? And the second area of the game, the scariest thing in gaming since PT or resident

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:04.640
evil seven VR discuss. Um, I couldn't tell you cause I haven't played it, but from what I've

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:11.920
heard about it, cause I've caught some things here and there. Um, it's just sounds, it sounds scary

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:17.440
because the character design is pretty crazy. Uh, it is not, from what I understand the lady

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:22.240
Dimitrescu and that is not like, she's just one part of the game. She's kind of like,

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:29.280
like in mega man, she would be like quick man. And then you still have other people you have

02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:33.920
to fight quick man was the tall one, right? No, it was that flash, man. I forget anyway.

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:41.440
Uh, but otherwise I would ask, see, Alan is right over there and I would ask him about

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.440
resident evil seven because he's been playing it on his stream, except, um, he's not wearing

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.320
a shirt right now and he's cooking, so I can't really bring him on stream. But, um, I know he's

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:54.320
been going through resident evil seven and I know that's, I haven't watched him play. I am very

02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:59.120
supportive of my husband streaming and you should follow him at Allen alchemy. Can he even hear me

02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:02.240
talking about him right now with his headphones in? Probably not. No, he thinks he's listening

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:07.200
to something else. Um, but, uh, I would, uh, I will not watch the resident evil seven stuff

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:15.280
cause there's too damn many jumpscares and my old heart can't take it. But anyway, um,

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.760
all right, let's see other comments in chat. Um, let's see. Uh, Oh, Oh, thank you. Chatter

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.680
chatters are given chain. The birthday wishes now in chat since he missed his at the beginning

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:29.920
of the show. I talked about that text you sent me with the damn Tron arcade one up.

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:34.480
All right. Anyway, uh, Oh, I'll get to discord and then we'll get some last minute stories.

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:38.880
Cause I know we have a few of those tonight. Um, but first, uh, let me do a couple topics

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:43.040
from discord. There was one thing, okay. And so over on discord, of course, over at vog

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.600
network.com slash discord, we'll get you into our server and we have a whole channel for orange

02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:51.680
lounge radio and you guys like to post things there throughout the week, including, Ooh,

02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:56.880
I didn't know about this. They're making a technical documentary. Interesting called

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:02.240
touching sound. Oh, it's already out and you can stream it on something called to be,

02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.800
which is one of those app services. You can stream that for free. Is that literally about

02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:12.560
DJ max technica and that it has to be, it's the same thing. So I wonder now, now Shane's in chat,

02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:18.720
I wonder if he knows about this, a whole movie documentary on technica. That's interesting. All

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:24.800
right. Uh, something else they've been posting about, uh, in our discord server, I think this

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:29.920
is very interesting. Tiger claw linked us to a tweet, uh, that is an indie developer making a

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:35.120
fighting game, but it uses cars and there's actually, uh, some little, uh, video of this

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:40.400
in action. It looks very interesting. Uh, I didn't catch what the name of the game is though, but the

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.240
tweet, the person on Twitter who did this, uh, fontace ranter is, uh, the person that did this.

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.760
And there's some other people that were kind of just discussing it and, uh, Oh, it's called

02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.520
shut up and drive. Thank you that there. Cause there's an FAQ that was linked there. So.

02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:59.360
Isn't that a Rihanna song? Uh, it is. And one of the greatest lip syncs in drag race history. Yes.

02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.400
But, uh, in this case, it's also a video game. She doesn't own that phrase. Uh, shut up and

02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:08.320
drive is something we've all been saying on the freeway for a long time. It was used in, um,

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:14.000
uh, wreck it Ralph. That's right. You can't help but hear that though. When, uh, you know, you,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.720
you see a name like that and you know, even though this is an indie studio, I hope somehow Rihanna

02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:23.680
would give the rights so that it can be in the trailer. Shut up and drive. Okay. I better not

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:30.080
sing too much or we're going to get DCM made. Um, Tiger claw also linked us to a tweet from

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:36.720
X-Box where, uh, they were talking about it's 2007. What are you booting up? And the screenshot had

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:42.800
halo three bio shock mass effect and rock band. This was a play on another viral tweet, uh,

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.080
that was like a movie had made like an eighties cinema with some quintessential eighties films.

02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:53.760
So they like photoshopped it. And I was like, Oh, rock band for sure. Hello. Hello. Anyway,

02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.360
let's do some last minute stories and I'll do a few more of your comments from discord. Um,

02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:00.720
dark soccer, I think you mentioned you had something tonight that you wanted to fit in here.

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:06.400
I did. It's just a little something, but on the 25th, so this Tuesday, um,

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.000
uh, there's going to be an announcement for dead by daylight and they've already teased this,

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.280
but for resident evil's 25th anniversary, um, dead by daylight is getting, uh, resident evil,

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:23.520
uh, a resident evil chapter for their 20th chapter. Um, lots of speculation as to what's

02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:31.360
going on. They are saying that there's, uh, um, highlights back to the classics.

02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:35.920
So there's a lot of people thinking that it's going to be centered around the original resident

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:40.080
evil. There's still people who are thinking it's going to be like from village. I don't know,

02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:44.880
but the hope is that, I mean, one of the big theories out there is that this is actually

02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:51.360
going to be multiple maps. Um, and at least two killers and two survivors. So we'll see

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:58.960
a big pack if that's true. I that's so, well, I mean the stranger things, one was one killer,

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:06.800
a map and two survivors and that's like 12 bucks. Yeah. So this is, if it's that big,

02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:12.960
it's probably going to at least be $20 DLC and I will do it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I, I would love

02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:17.920
to see village in it. Um, I personally, I would love to see lady David Trescu. I think she's just

02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:23.040
such a character and she'd be so good as a killer in day by day by daylight. I have heard the rumor

02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:27.600
about her daughters being one of the killers and that they're witches that you can like switch

02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:33.120
between and shape shift. I think that's kind of cool too. I'm down with that. Someone did a mod

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:41.840
that turns, I think Dwight into Ethan or David into Ethan cause the body shape and then, um,

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:47.280
one of the daughters into nurse or from nurse. Hmm. Interesting. But I think a lot of the heavy

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:54.240
rumors are that it's Jill and Leon and it's a nemesis and I'm kind of like, you're probably

02:29:54.240 --> 02:30:04.960
right. I thought I read who's the character in four. I thought that was, I didn't play four.

02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:09.360
Okay. That was Leon though. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, but if they were going to do Leon,

02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:14.480
it should be like Leon and Claire. I mean, I think they would do Jill and Chris and have

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:19.920
skins for Leon and Claire. Oh, that makes sense. Cause they are speaking of stranger things. They

02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:24.960
are doing a skin for Steve to turn him into the other character. It doesn't look right. Cause

02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:32.800
his face structure is so different. No, it doesn't. Um, uh, but the, uh, I think, I mean,

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.040
I think it would honestly be super possible, especially if it's nemesis, it would be really

02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:42.800
easy to have a cosmetic for mr. X. Yeah. Um, I'm still going to cross my fingers that the

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:47.840
vampress, the vampires or the witches are going to be the killer, but I think we're going to get

02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:52.560
skins for those. If it's nemesis, I'll still buy, who am I kidding? I'm going to buy it.

02:30:52.560 --> 02:31:00.240
And look at what they did for, for, uh, Heather in, uh, in the, sorry, Cheryl. I played her as

02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:08.480
Heather. So long. I still call her Heather. Um, in, uh, uh, the re the silent Hill chapter

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:16.320
is that they gave her the, uh, Sybil skin and the, uh, the nurse, what was her name?

02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:26.960
Lisa, Lisa Garland. And that they, uh, also gave her the, um, uh, Alyssa skin.

02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:33.360
Um, our R H M zero eight seven in chat says, would it be strange for one of the survivors

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:37.760
to have special powers? See my previous comment on Scott Howard, not to be confused with Scott

02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:42.560
McCall. Um, no, no, no, it would not be weird for, you know, they'll, they'll do a talent.

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:49.040
That's gonna mix things up perks. Like for example, um, you got, you know, perks that

02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:54.560
let you fight back from Laurie. Yeah. Or, um, I would say the biggest example is a leather face,

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:59.680
uh, and barbecue and chili is like a, a, I don't want to say a mandatory killer talent,

02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:03.600
but the quality of life from that singular talent, it's like, you kind of like, like,

02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:10.000
you have to get that DLC, which what a clever way to make people buy DLC, huh? But, um, yeah.

02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:13.520
So yes, they could do, they could do things that are really going to mix it up,

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:16.800
but I don't think they would be unique to the character. They'd be unique to the perks.

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:24.960
Um, yeah, but the whole thing is, is that the, the, um, the survivors cannot attack a killer

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:33.440
except for like blind, the escape tactics, like decisive strike. Um, so, you know,

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:40.560
and you do have like distraction, things like the pebble, everyone loves the pebble. Um, um,

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:45.520
I'm sorry, that's good. And like things like that are good for against killers that, you know,

02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:52.480
are use audio based clues like, um, nurse and a spirit for example. Yeah. But yeah, I think that,

02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:58.160
um, we're not going to have any that can actually just legit fight back or David, the character,

02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:01.760
David would have been completely screwed over. Cause that was his whole storyline as a fighter.

02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:05.760
Um, an RHM in chat says a literal werewolf. I just, I just don't think so. They're not,

02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:09.520
they can't do anything that's going to completely like turning into a werewolf and being able to

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:14.160
run super fast or whatever the werewolf can do like fight back. We already have sprint burst.

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:18.640
Yeah. I already have dead hard. They can't do something that's going to completely break the

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:23.280
game. And it's also, it's part of dead by daylight's nature that the perks transfer from

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.880
character to character. So somebody can turn into a werewolf. They all need to be able to turn into

02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:31.760
werewolf. And that would just be a little, a little weird now, but at the same time,

02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:35.520
they've talked to, you know, and I don't want to completely dismiss the comment. It's a fair

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:41.680
idea because they have also said it's the fifth anniversary. This resident evil thing is going

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:45.200
to change up the game a little bit. We have new things in store for this game. You know,

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:49.040
it's five years old and people are just now finding it and we're going to mix it up a little

02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:55.040
bit. So I say all this, but at the same time, maybe they will do something completely radical

02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:00.720
and different. Um, your idea is not farfetched in that regard. So there's one way to find out and

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:07.440
that's watch on Tuesday. So I'm excited about it. Are you? Um, yeah, yeah. I mean, now that I'm into

02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:12.480
this game for sure. I want to see the reveal. I'm actually almost more interested in the roadmap

02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:17.760
for the future. Yeah. Well, they're, they're going to definitely be doing some talking about that on,

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:26.080
um, on a Tuesday as well. I'm glad it's my day off. Um, but, but that DLC itself is going to

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:32.640
be coming out, um, later on in June. Yeah. Um, okay. Now, uh, let me get to some other

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:36.720
discord comments and I'll check in with Loki here. Um, let's see. Oh, I thought this was

02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:41.680
interesting. Dungeon buster shared a tweet, uh, from Jason Schreier. Hope I said that right.

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.720
Who said, uh, it was kind of countering and he's, he's does game journalism stuff. I'm sorry. I

02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:49.680
don't, I don't follow them all. I don't know who they work for. Cause they always move around and

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.080
stuff. Sorry. I, sorry. Uh, but, uh, it says rumors like this keep floating around, but

02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:59.280
starfield is nowhere near done. According to several people familiar with development,

02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:03.440
it'll be at E3, but the plan release date I've heard is way later than most people think.

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.960
Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't either, but at the same time,

02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:15.840
Bethesda usually doesn't show the inner workings of the game until it is ready.

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:20.240
So I'm not completely pushing back on the comment. I mean, obviously he has more industry,

02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:26.640
you know, insiders and stuff than I certainly do, but I would wonder how much are they really going

02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:32.160
to show it if they're not ready to show, you know, to, to release the game, that's not usually

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:37.920
Bethesda's thing. At the same time, something very different has happened in the last year with

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:44.080
Bethesda. Microsoft bought them. So maybe that is going to change their entire approach. That is

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:50.160
certainly a, uh, thought within the realm of possibility. It is plausible. All right. I'll

02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:57.840
just fucking say it. It's plausible. So, but we'll see at E3, huh? All right. Uh, Bobby says he's

02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:02.320
actually a journalist doing actual journalism. He's with Bloomberg. Thank you. I can, I can never

02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:06.960
follow. They're at Kotaku one day, Polygon the next, then they're going, they're, they're working

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:13.360
at a newspaper somewhere else. Sorry. It's just, it's hard to keep track. All right. Anyhow. Uh,

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:18.080
let's see. Loki, do you have any last minute stories? Um, yeah, I did have one. Unfortunately,

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:24.080
the servers for LittleBigPlanet had to be shut down temporarily because somebody hacked into

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:29.920
them and put a bunch of transphobic comments everywhere on all of the different, um, levels.

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:38.480
So, um, well, at least, you know what, as old as that game is at this point,

02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:43.760
I'm glad they're doing the right thing and fucking stopping that. So you know what? It's

02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:47.600
the temporary shutdown. They just have to clean the issue up, but it's, it's because it's so

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:53.920
widespread. I see this as a good thing. Not the hack, not that, but the fact that Sony is still

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.600
going back and addressing it and cleaning it the fuck up. That's a good thing. Thank you.

02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:03.280
Yeah. Oh, is that it? That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I think we're about to the

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:07.760
end of the show and, uh, Alan just finished dinner, so I'm ready to eat. So we're going

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.400
to wrap things up. Uh, thank you guys for listening to our show tonight. Really appreciate you guys.

02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:15.920
We had a lot of great topics tonight. Just really appreciate you guys being here. Um,

02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.680
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:22.720
show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:27.680
but we need more gamers in here to have their voices heard. Um, a nice five star review on a

02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.960
site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show. It goes an awful long way. Um, hosting on

02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.600
your Twitch channel, whether you're here live or not, um, it goes a long way and is super

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:41.600
appreciated. Just type slash host a VOG network in your own chat. Actually you want to add it to

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:45.360
your auto host list is even better because the slash command just does it one time. Um,

02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:49.440
but yeah, thank you guys for being here. If you feel so inclined, we have a shop,

02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:56.320
vognetwork.com slash shop. Um, and, um, yeah. Uh, thank you just for being a part of this and all

02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:01.360
the great comments and nice things you had to say tonight. Really appreciate you. Um, let's go

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:08.240
around and get everybody's final thoughts. Um, I will start tonight because somebody did a redeem

02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:13.200
with a post show shout out. So technically it's supposed to be after the show, but I just have to

02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:20.240
read it now. Uh, fat ninja DM redeemed this, uh, earlier and said, as always you guys and gals

02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:25.280
from the VOG network, knock it out of the park every week. I stepped away from podcast for years

02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:30.480
and then got back into it. And OLR was the first podcast I started looking for. If I could describe

02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:36.720
OLR in one word, it would be timeless. OLR always adjust to the video game and social landscape.

02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:41.120
Can't gush about you guys and gals enough. Keep doing what you're doing much love and respect.

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.160
Thank you so much for that. And it was funny. Yeah. I have heard something along the line,

02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.520
not, not quite. You put it very, very kindly and very complimentary, but I have heard the whole,

02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:57.280
um, I, I, uh, I was randomly looking up orange lounge radio. Cause I remembered listening to

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:05.120
that in the DDR freak days. You guys are still going. Dang. That's that's usually what they're

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:11.440
still going. The fuck? Yeah. It's usually the reaction I hear. So, um, thank you for putting

02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:17.920
it a lot nicer. Although I appreciate everyone that discovers the show. I hope you're not too

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:24.000
disappointed. We don't exclusively talk about DDR music games anymore. We still love those games an

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:30.160
awful lot. Trust. So, all right. Yeah. Bobby Blackwell. When I meet people, they say, yeah,

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:34.960
I used to listen to you 15 years ago. Yeah. I have many former listeners. Yeah. Same,

02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:40.560
same. If we show up at a convention or something, it'll be like, I, when I first got my iPhone,

02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:47.120
I downloaded you. And then it's like, what'd you do after that? Oh, I unsubscribed. Oh, okay.

02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:53.680
Tea. It's it's fine. It's fine. I understand. Look, as long as you're supporting an independent

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:59.680
broadcaster or broadcast team somewhere and supporting independent voices, um, you know,

02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:04.640
celebrities are really taking over podcasting. And look, sometimes that's a cool thing. I like

02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:09.600
the Trixie and Katya podcast. Okay. I'm going to listen to that Lori Beth Denver podcast. I get it.

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:14.480
But at the same time, it is so important to support our indie scene as well. And these

02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.360
people, you know, really working hard, uh, from, from the love of the games and the industry and

02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:25.760
so much, um, out of their spare bedrooms on Skype or discord where a stream yard is another big one

02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:30.400
or wherever they are. Um, it just support your indie friends and indie podcasters. It means a

02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:37.440
lot. Okay. Um, sorry. That was a very long final thought, but, um, I had to do it. So Loki,

02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:41.120
how about you? How's your, what's your final thought? Uh, final thought is, like I said,

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.280
uh, I'm hoping that my second episode of my, um, YouTube series done today and then episode

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:52.880
three be becoming much sooner. I've been making the mistake of doing too much in between stuff.

02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:58.640
So I planning things out a little bit better. So, uh, I've already got what's going to be in

02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:04.960
episode three and so they'll become much sooner. So look forward to that. Nice orange ride and

02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:09.680
chat says orange launch radio, my source of vital information. Thank you. Maybe that'll be the

02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:14.080
future tagline. All right. Uh, Dar soccer last, but certainly not least your final thought.

02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.520
Stay tuned. I'm going to be doing some dead by daylight and hopefully not screwing up with my

02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:25.280
new mouse. So we'll see. Oh, you changed that. I forgot that you got a new mouse. Oh,

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:29.440
I haven't started using it yet. So I'm probably going to try it on stream. I just,

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:32.880
I've been using a thumb track ball and I'm actually starting to get like some repetitive

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:40.160
thumb problems. Oh, so, um, that, and if you ever watch any of my streams or my clips, you'll see

02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.680
it's kind of jerky. Yeah. Yeah. I could tell your track ball was doing that. So I'm actually

02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.320
excited for you to see how that might improve, um, by having the mouse now. It'll be interesting.

02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:55.760
Yeah, we'll see. So, um, so yeah, I'm going to go ahead and drop out for now. Yep. But,

02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:01.280
um, have a good night, everybody. I hope to see you in, in stream and, uh, don't text me

02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:04.240
when I'm trying to do the readouts. You'll get the rate in like four minutes. Okay.

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.600
Uh, I, I will let me know when you're ready and I'll let you know if I'm out of the,

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.720
okay. Okay. You got it. All right. Later kids. All right. Um, on that note, I will say good night to

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.200
everybody. I'm here at orange launch radio. Um, of course, for those listening live, we'll be back

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:25.520
after the credits as we usually are just to do some final shout outs. Um, but for everybody out

02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:31.120
there, podcast feed and live reminder, we're taken next week off Rob wants a vacation. Um,

02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:36.560
so have a good, it's weird to say happy Memorial day. Cause it's not exactly a happy, but I want

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:43.600
to just say, you know, have a good long weekend. Um, you know, it's been a crazy year and a half.

02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.440
And I think a lot of people are going to be able to do, even if things aren't back to normal yet,

02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.040
and they shouldn't be completely normal. I think a lot of us are going to get to do things where

02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.720
we get like a taste of that back, you know, talk about mental health and all that. A lot of us

02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:58.400
are going to get to get, get a taste, see some people that are also vaccinated that we haven't

02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:03.040
seen in a long time and all that stuff. I hope this Memorial day is a good one, uh, for many

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.520
of you out there. And if you want to stay home all weekend and play video games, you know what,

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.720
that is fine too. Have a great time doing it. We'll see you in 14 days with another new episode

02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.400
