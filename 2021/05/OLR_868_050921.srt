1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Electronic music has come a long way since the late 90s and early 2000s, and I am pumped

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,300
to hear that Avex is bringing back its Cybertrance album series.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,960
The combination of Avex tracks, Toshiba EMI, and Konami's in-house tunes account for

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,720
a huge amount of my teenage listening and enjoyment.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,220
My rose-colored glasses are on and vivid.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,460
The best part of everything being cyclical is when your favorites come back.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,900
This is my choice of hype for this week.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,060
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,820
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where Every

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,340
Gamer Has a Voice.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,940
Me too, Jason, except my early 20s.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,940
Anyway, hi, everybody.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,180
Hello, everyone out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,480
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,420
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again here with episode number 868 of

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,780
our show for this May the 9th of 2021.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,260
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined via the magic of Discord during these quarantiny

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,580
times with the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,780
I wish someone would make me a quarantiny.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,740
I could use a little bit of both.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,180
I was just realizing I was trying to make up a word, and I don't think I did.

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:28,860
I think I actually named a very popular beverage in these trying times, I'm sure.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,220
Well, I think that a bunch of people tried to copyright it to you, but I don't think

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,100
that you can copyright the pain of others.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,700
Probably not, although I'm sure someone would try, that's for sure.

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Oh, you know someone's tried.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
How did the stream go after last week's show?

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,440
You were playing some Fantasian for the very first time after last week's OLR.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
How was all that?

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,900
I really like Fantasian.

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
It's pretty good.

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,720
I just think that I'm going to move that stream to Tuesday night because it's not super exciting,

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,500
you know, but it's a good story.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,040
I've really been enjoying it, and I think I'm going to just do a little bit of it like

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
every Tuesday.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,320
I actually have my schedule posted on Twitch now.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Whether or not I adhere to it is a completely different story.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,720
That's why I don't post one because I know I won't adhere to it.

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,300
Well, you know, that's not true because here at VOG Network, we've adhered to this Sunday

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,620
night at six o'clock thing for, you know, coming up on 19 years, but it took a long

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,160
time to really make that routine, you know, and a lot of people always ask, well, what

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,000
would you do on Sunday night if OLR ended?

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,300
And I'm like, I literally do not know.

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,920
Like 19 years of my life, Sunday night is this.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Like what am I supposed to say?

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
It's ending?

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
No, I'm just saying, people ask.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
I mean, but I'm just saying, it'll end?

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
What?

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Well.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
What words are you speaking?

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
I don't know this reality.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,080
All good things come to an end eventually.

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
I don't mean tomorrow or next week, but you know, you never know what's going to happen.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Maybe if I get run over by a Mack truck.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,700
Let's not say those things, but you know, yeah, something could happen.

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
You never know.

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,780
We had some scares in the past and luckily we made it through unscathed and here we are

59
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,300
19 years later.

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Yeah.

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,140
And some of our listeners, hi listeners, because we do tape live every Sunday night at six

62
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,420
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,700
network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and STA-100 Matt, so our listeners get in

64
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
on this too.

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,980
STA-100 Matt says, I don't remember my Sunday nights pre-OLR, kind of getting info watching

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,740
Simpsons and scrambling to finish homework territory.

67
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Yeah.

68
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm trying to think of what my son, Oh, I remember my Sunday nights before OLR.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,660
I used to go to the goth club.

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,540
I did on occasion too.

71
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,540
True story.

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Yep.

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
We used to go together.

74
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
We were friends before OLR.

75
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,580
So, uh, yeah, we used to go a lot.

76
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Yeah.

77
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,020
But we, but we met through, uh, I met, I think I met Jessica before I met you.

78
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,620
Um, probably.

79
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,620
I don't remember.

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Exactly.

81
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Yeah.

82
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
I was there that same day at golf land.

83
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,340
I think when I thought that I had met you when we went to play Para Para.

84
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,180
Yes, it was that, Oh, you met, you met probably a go on a girl, uh, a week or two prior or

85
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,340
something before that happened.

86
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,860
I think something like either that, or I met you both at the same time, but yeah, I met

87
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,260
you guys over the Balinese.

88
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
Yeah.

89
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,700
And that would have literally been over 20 years ago at this point, which is crazy to

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
think about.

91
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Isn't it?

92
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Oh my gosh.

93
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,020
There was a lot of guest hosting on, uh, under sedation too long after that.

94
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Yep.

95
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,820
That was the show I was on, um, concurrently with OLR in the beginning, but, um, before

96
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
OLR.

97
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,220
Uh, so yeah, it's fun, fun times.

98
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Anyway.

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,700
Uh, I would also say hello to tech master Loki.

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm not sure if he's actually there.

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
He's blacked out.

102
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
I'm here.

103
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Hi.

104
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
I'm just eating.

105
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
So I figured we don't want to see that.

106
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Yeah, probably not.

107
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
That's okay.

108
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Well, how are you Loki?

109
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,140
I've been trying to stretch for time because I thought you were away from keyboard.

110
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
My bad.

111
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
That's all right.

112
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
I'm here.

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm here.

114
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,580
I can turn the camera on.

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,620
I had to rush and do a bunch of things at the last minute.

116
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,500
I had like two minutes to eat food and get the setup and then of course OBS and discord

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,100
and my cam software decided to feud it out.

118
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,740
So that delayed my time to have the, uh, yeah.

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Been there, done that.

120
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,760
I've, I've, I've been there, done that scarf and down food before, uh, doing a live stream

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
at one point.

122
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,840
Well, of course everybody wants to know what you eat and, uh, the bacon ultimate cheeseburger.

123
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Of course.

124
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Yes.

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
Cause I haven't had one of those in like a few weeks.

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
So I figured, I figured why not?

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Good job.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,520
About 15 minutes ago I was, uh, eating freshly smoked tri-tip.

129
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I don't get dinner till after OLR.

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,880
I eat late on Sunday nights, so, um, you'll figure it was bacon.

131
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
You'd be surprised.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
I don't eat that much bacon really.

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
Um, given the opportunity.

134
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,320
Yes, I will add bacon to the things, but I don't actually eat bacon that often anymore.

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,600
So this is a bacon story.

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,320
I promise yesterday I had the opportunity to see, um, grandpa Warcraft.

137
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,160
For those of you that remember my old show, horde house, or if you ever listened to the

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
starboard power coupling, which was here on VOG, you remember grandpa Matt, uh, from both

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
of those shows.

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,760
And I got to see him yesterday, which was great because I really haven't seen a lot

141
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,480
of people during all this, uh, quarantine stuff.

142
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,480
But now that I'm fully vaccinated, he's fully vaccinated.

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
We were able to hang out yesterday.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Um, and by the way, so he has a, he has a new, um, cabin in the woods that he's at.

145
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,340
And by the way, the cabin in the woods has a hot tub and wifi.

146
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,380
So if we do want to do a VOG hot tub stream, we can probably do one.

147
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,800
So I'm just going to throw that out there.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
We broke.

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
He's great.

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
He's still doing well.

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,480
Thinking about him this morning, going to cut roses.

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Yeah.

153
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Love that bitch.

154
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,280
For those of you who don't know, I live in his old house, so it was great to see him

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
and everything.

156
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,520
Uh, but we went to some nice little restaurant up in, uh, for, for those of you, uh, locals,

157
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,400
Nevada city, which is the cute, cute little town up in the, you know, up in the Hills.

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Right.

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,940
And, uh, they, they've shot hallmark movies up there.

160
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
It's so cute.

161
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,240
We went to one of the little bougie restaurants.

162
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,320
So here's here, I'm, I promise I get to bacon, um, Alan, who is, he's lost, he's lost a lot

163
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,380
of weight during this quarantine stuff.

164
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Many of us have gained.

165
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,900
Alan is lost and he eats very well.

166
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Um, and he ordered as an appetizer, some Brussels sprouts.

167
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,580
Now here's the thing I fucking, I fucking hate Brussels sprouts, but I ate these.

168
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Why?

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Why do you hate Brussels sprouts?

170
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
They're delicious.

171
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Because they're fucking disgusting.

172
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,560
Except you haven't had them cooked right.

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,900
Can I finish my goddamn story?

174
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,740
So the way the bacon's on them, then yes, yes.

175
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,500
So I, but I actually ate the Brussels sprouts here because they, they roasted him, which

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,560
was like, the only way I'll eat them is like doing the roasting thing.

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,180
And then of course they put like bacon in mixed in with it and it was chef's kiss.

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
Amazing.

179
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,120
So how will you get Rob to eat Brussels sprouts roasted with bacon?

180
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
That's the only way to do it.

181
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,180
I eat my Brussels sprouts with a full pack of bacon in them and heavy cream and cheese

182
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,860
and onions and garlic.

183
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,420
But then I don't think it's really healthy anymore.

184
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,820
Like it's totally keto.

185
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,020
I mean, it's totally like no carbs.

186
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,740
It's just, it's all of the calories and meat and fat, but it's, Oh my God, it's so good.

187
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,460
Tiger class asking a very valid question.

188
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,100
Is the internet good at the cabin?

189
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
To which I found out.

190
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Yes.

191
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,640
He gets gigabit up there, which like, I don't know who, why does a cabin in the woods get

192
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,220
better internet than I do?

193
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
I don't know.

194
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,420
I was surprised at that too.

195
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,500
I guess you probably have a lot of people running businesses out of their homes.

196
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,920
I have no, that's blew my mind too.

197
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
It really did.

198
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
So, all right.

199
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,280
Anyway, I actually have access to a hot tub in my neighborhood since my friend who is

200
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,120
on Twitch is Amethyst Rose, which has a lovely large one at her house and has given me free

201
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,960
rain to come over.

202
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,640
So that may be a bonus stream in the future is the OLR hot tub stream, but don't, don't

203
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,280
get it twisted.

204
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,120
Like we're, we're there to literally sit in the hot tub and I'm keeping my shirt on cause

205
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,080
a you don't need to see that on Twitch.

206
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,120
B I sunburn really easily.

207
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,280
It's like, I used to be before it all went gray.

208
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,040
I used to have red hair.

209
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,820
So we burn really easily.

210
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,320
So yeah, but, but we, we will do a hot tub stream if I can convince my ghosts.

211
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,800
After I lost like some of the first bit of my weight, I bought myself a really cute bathing

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,280
suit that has like a cat face on it.

213
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,120
And then now it's too big for me.

214
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,840
Plus there will be adventures in hair dye in the next couple of months that involves

215
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
the color blue.

216
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Fun.

217
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Um, and so I need to actually get a swim cap to be able to go in chlorinated water.

218
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Me and a shirt, you and a swim cap.

219
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,040
I think Loki should have the sun sunbathing, like sunscreen paint, like, or just do the

220
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Zuckerberg thing.

221
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Yes.

222
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
All right.

223
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,600
Anyway, so we're going to have a, we're going to, I've already volunteered everybody.

224
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
We're going to have a hot tub stream in the not too distant future.

225
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
We'll figure it out.

226
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
All right.

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,560
Anyway, all right, let's get into it, but we're not here to talk about hot tubs.

228
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,480
We're here to talk about video games and wow, our industry had a lot of fascinating video

229
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
game news this week.

230
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Um, I think everybody knows about the court battle that's going on right now between Epic

231
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Games and Apple.

232
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,400
We've talked about that at length on the show.

233
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,760
The reality is we're not going to have a resolution to that whole thing for months because you

234
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
know, legal stuff takes time.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,180
Even though the trial, yes, is only a few weeks.

236
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,960
The judge will still take months and months to come up with her decision.

237
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,300
So we don't know what's really going to happen there until later.

238
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,960
But the fascinating part is that it's not even just really Epic and Apple, but all of

239
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,520
these other companies are having secrets that are kind of put out there in open court.

240
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes, there are some things that are redacted.

241
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,880
We haven't seen necessarily everything, but we're certainly seeing a lot more and getting

242
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,800
a real peek into the insight of this industry, into how CEOs write their emails.

243
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,160
We're getting insight into the types of things that are discussed, the goals that the long

244
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,640
term goals that these companies have, who's making money, who's not making money.

245
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,660
We're getting a lot of insight that I didn't think many of us thought we'd really get from

246
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,880
a court battle like this.

247
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,000
This probably also helps explain why so many times companies settle out of court.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,640
They don't want to go to this point because of all the testimony, the evidence that gets

249
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,160
entered and all that stuff.

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,640
So anyway, let's talk about some of the evidence that's been entered and some of the things

251
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,760
we have learned as a result of that.

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,480
Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.

253
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,960
There's several items to talk about and Dark Soccer, I think we'll start with you.

254
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
You had one.

255
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah.

256
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:01,560
So I'll just go ahead and start off with this, that Epic had offered a $200 million deal

257
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:11,380
to Sony for, and the quote is, up to four to six PlayStation ports to PC.

258
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:18,120
They were wanting to target several different video game producers, you know, big triple

259
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:26,020
A names to try to bring their games over through their store and it's actually stated in their

260
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,100
document that Nintendo was pretty much, quote, a non-starter, end quote.

261
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,100
But their discussions with Microsoft were pretty much complicated because it was competitor

262
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:48,700
for content, you know, for the, their PC game pass thing was against Epic strategy.

263
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,500
So and on top of that, Sony had already stated that it was looking to bring a whole bunch

264
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,040
of games to PC.

265
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,380
So they, I mean, their first, their first PC port for Horizon Zero Dawn was on Steam.

266
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,400
That's what I was thinking is that we've, we've seen all these PC releases from Sony.

267
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,460
So it's interesting to think that Epic was really making a play for those.

268
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Yeah.

269
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,540
Well, and that in days gone is also coming to Steam.

270
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,660
So it's really looking like Steam is going to be their primary platform.

271
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,600
And from what I understand, it actually is easier to manage their own DLC through Steam.

272
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,660
So that would, that would make sense.

273
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,900
And even, even Microsoft, even though there's that competitive space with game pass, and

274
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,740
I would think also the Windows store is also inherently competition, but yet we've seen

275
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,820
Microsoft actually kind of making moves with Steam as well.

276
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,140
They've kind of relented on the fact that Steam has such a hold on the PC marketplace

277
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,780
that it actually benefits Microsoft to put things like, I'm trying to think what the

278
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,140
most recent thing was that they put on there.

279
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,340
Maybe Halo Master Chief Collection or things like that.

280
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,500
They've actually been putting on Steam.

281
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Which is fascinating.

282
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Sorry.

283
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
But I thought that was interesting.

284
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,180
Well, on top of that too, there's another document released during everything that Epic

285
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:16,740
spent something like $12 million to secure games for its free giveaways.

286
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah.

287
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:28,220
And it's just, I have this feeling that they're trying to keep some sort of tight reign on

288
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,420
the, on the content that they're able to bring in.

289
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Does that make sense?

290
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Oh yeah.

291
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
Oh yeah.

292
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,180
And again, tighter though than some of the other services.

293
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,820
Our chat room is lighting up with comments relating to some of this.

294
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,860
Phoenix 7726 wants to point out that Horizon did go on good old games as well.

295
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,340
So it wasn't like exclusive to Steam.

296
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,700
I thought at first it was only on Steam though, but I could be wrong.

297
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,940
You may be right that it was, I thought, but I thought maybe after a little bit of time,

298
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
it went to both.

299
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,660
But anyway, I could be wrong.

300
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,180
And it doesn't necessarily matter.

301
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
It's not on Epic.

302
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
True.

303
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
That's the point is it went somewhere other than Epic.

304
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
True.

305
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Fair enough.

306
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,460
Quest Buster in chat says, I'm not sure that in every indie was happy to see what they

307
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,140
were being paid by Epic to be on their store.

308
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Oh yeah.

309
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Yeah.

310
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
I found that fascinating too.

311
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
So it's out there.

312
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,660
Oh, I'll take half the price, half the price of the lowest tier one that they have except

313
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
for the zero one.

314
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,220
I'm not taking zero, but I'll put pixel poops.

315
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Number two on there.

316
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,100
I'll take a quarter of that.

317
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,660
You know, he's paid me $12,000 and you can have, you could give that game away for free.

318
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
I'm cool.

319
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,020
You out there, you out there, Tim Sweeney, you part of the oil army listening to this

320
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
shit.

321
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,660
Probably even sweeten the deal even more and undercut me even more on that.

322
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,340
Still say yes.

323
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
I love that.

324
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,260
Tweet at him, get his attention.

325
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,340
But yeah, it's, but the comment is still true.

326
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
What our listener said.

327
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,300
It's probably really alarming for some of the indies to see like those that made more,

328
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,120
those that didn't make much because some of those games, like I think the Batman trilogy,

329
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
like I could be wrong.

330
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,080
I don't have the chart in front of me, but I remember that one was like a million bucks

331
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
or something.

332
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
A lot of money.

333
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
And Arkham was like 15.

334
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
It was a 1.5 million.

335
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,340
That was a lot of money, you know, especially for a game that wasn't particularly new as

336
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
a few years old.

337
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,960
And most of the games they give away are old, but not all of them are.

338
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
Some of them are new.

339
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,120
And so they paid a lot less for that.

340
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,680
Now, granted, it takes a much larger team to build a Batman Arkham Asylum than it does

341
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,520
to build, you know, some of the indie titles, but still to kind of see that in the numbers

342
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,400
and really see the differences in the numbers was really shocking.

343
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,360
I definitely like if you haven't seen that document, look it up.

344
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,560
Obviously, it would be very boring for me to sit here and read the Excel spreadsheet

345
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,680
aloud you.

346
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,000
You all follow the industry.

347
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm sure you're going to Google it and look that up if you haven't already, because it

348
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,960
was all over Twitter and social media.

349
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,760
But I thought that was fascinating.

350
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,280
And this is this is that's exactly the type of document I didn't think we were going to

351
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,760
get out of this trial and that probably everybody would have liked to avoid.

352
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
It was interesting.

353
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,320
So anyway, that dark soccer.

354
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Thank you for that.

355
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,080
Loki, you've been following some of the secret secrets unlocked as well, right?

356
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Yeah.

357
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,320
So, you know, apparently during the court case, Apple is trying to get Epic to admit

358
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,760
that there's like some questionable content on their storefront only because they have

359
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
the itch.io app.

360
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,640
And we know what kind of junk's on there.

361
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
My game.

362
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
So and porn.

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
There's porn on there, too.

364
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,000
But, you know, because I guess since that's accessible on their storefront, they're kind

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,560
of trying to say that it's it's part of it.

366
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,940
But they're, I don't know, very clever play when you consider that itch.io was just added

367
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,000
to Epic like a week before the trial started.

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,480
And they even kind of got called out on that is that, well, you just put itch.io on the

369
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,040
store conveniently before trial.

370
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,920
And then that turned into this whole so Epic is fine with porn being on its marketplace.

371
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
It's a very interesting tactic, very, very interesting.

372
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,240
Anyway, I was fascinated by that, but go ahead.

373
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,560
And then also, I thought it was interesting that they've made nine billion dollars on

374
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,680
Fortnite between twenty eighteen and twenty nineteen.

375
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,000
So that's that's only I mean, that's ridiculous, just nine billion dollars in like a couple

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
of years.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
And I'm assuming that's just grown since then.

378
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,440
So I guess that's why they want to get it on the Apple store to make even more billions.

379
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
They got to start getting in the positive dollars fast, right?

380
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Yeah, pretty much.

381
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Were you surprised to hear that the epic store is losing money?

382
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Yeah, but I mean, it's just it's not that old and, you know, it takes a while for businesses

383
00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:00,680
to turn a profit, and especially if they're even giving away the free stuff, if that necessarily

384
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,600
brings people to the epic store to maybe try Fortnite or something like that, I'm sure

385
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,400
they more than make up for it with the profits that they're making from that.

386
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,120
So it's it's more of like a loss leader, I guess.

387
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Yeah, it's it's the digital version of what Black Friday is all about to retailers.

388
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,560
You sell that cheap ass two hundred dollar TV or whatever it is to get people in the

389
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,360
door to then look at the other things that are in there that maybe aren't as good on

390
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
a sale.

391
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,800
This is this is something that Fry's Electronics was notorious for.

392
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Rest in peace, right?

393
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,000
If you've ever been to a Fry's Electronics and I'm sure there's other stores like this,

394
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but Fry's especially.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,960
So you walk into Fry's, you buy something like one of these loss leaders, even though

396
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,760
there's maybe five or ten of them available on Black Friday.

397
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
But then what happens?

398
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,820
You go to stand in line and wait for a checkout.

399
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,880
How long is that little tunnel?

400
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,600
Not not literally a tunnel, but you are surrounded on the left and right.

401
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
How long is that little tunnel to wait to check out?

402
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,200
It is literally like a queue to a line at Disneyland.

403
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,960
It is extremely long and wrapping around Black Friday.

404
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,520
You have to find the end of the line with a dude that has a giant like a bouquet of

405
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,800
balloons, you know, saying the line ends here and it just winds through the entire store.

406
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,960
I mean, you're literally forced through an aisle.

407
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,760
That is shit you don't need, but you want it anyway.

408
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,400
It's like I don't need this cotton candy machine.

409
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,480
I don't need this hot dog warmer that they have for convenience stores, but they have

410
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,920
it in the store and I'm kind of considering it walking past it.

411
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,080
But you know, I don't really need that.

412
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,840
Oh, hey, look at all of these cool USB things.

413
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,200
I could use some more USB cables and ooh, and some balls, you know, you know, some of

414
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
that.

415
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,080
I mean, there's lots of stuff anyway.

416
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
That's it.

417
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
And I love Fry's.

418
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,280
Honestly, none of us really complained about what they were doing, but it is very obvious

419
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
what they are.

420
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,240
Maybe if I had kids, I'd complain because there's a lot of fucking candy in that aisle.

421
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
But anyway, I digress.

422
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,360
It was fine with kids.

423
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,000
It was it was a great store just to walk around and check out all the weird stuff and especially

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,120
like, you know, going in there, they had all these like bargain bins just like when you

425
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
walked in.

426
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
It was just all over the place.

427
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,820
All these things that they were like as seen on TV or just it's like, ooh, ooh, I'll look

428
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,580
at all this like canned air.

429
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,220
Ooh, look at all these batteries.

430
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,420
I could buy like a 50 pack of batteries.

431
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
It's so cheap.

432
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,140
It's like that's that's exactly that's exactly it.

433
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,380
So what we're looking at with Epic Games and that's what it's it's the digital version

434
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
of that.

435
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,820
You put a loss leader like a free game to get that thing installed on somebody's computer,

436
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,140
the Epic Games launcher, and then, oh, look at all these game sales that are going on

437
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
or exclusives.

438
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,020
Y'all want some Borderlands three, OK, you know, all this stuff in the store.

439
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,500
And to obviously, to some extent, it has worked.

440
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah.

441
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Some interesting comments in chat.

442
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
D.J.

443
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,380
Rama S. says, you see what they did with Discord.

444
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Oh, I always said that was this still blows my mind to this day how this didn't work,

445
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,180
that Discord put this free chat app on everybody's computer.

446
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,100
They were like basically like, oh, slack.

447
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,220
Oh, we're going to make a free version of that.

448
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,780
Oh, team, team, team speak.

449
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,780
What the hell was it?

450
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Ventrilo.

451
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,900
We're going to make a free version of that.

452
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,540
And you put this thing on the computers free and then they put a game store in it.

453
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,740
And I thought that was the smartest thing I think I'd ever seen a company do.

454
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,700
Yet it flopped and they no longer sell games.

455
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Unbelievable.

456
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,780
It's unbelievable to me.

457
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,580
But I think I don't think they swung hard enough with that.

458
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,020
And I know that's weird to say because I think if they'd swung harder, it might have annoyed

459
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,540
some of us.

460
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
But I think that's where they maybe made the mistake.

461
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,500
But anyway, I think that's very interesting.

462
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,300
Let's see, Questbuster says it's all about getting the bodies or Epic's case, the fresh

463
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,740
user accounts into their store and so on and so on.

464
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,940
So anyway, Loki, a few more tidbits that came out of the courtroom.

465
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,460
Yeah, so let's see what else we have here.

466
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:04,260
Well, we talked about the exclusives and how much money they had there for that.

467
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,460
So it was like one billion dollars, which is ridiculous.

468
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,380
And I don't know, that's all it pretty much had.

469
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,940
There's there's a lot of drama going on that I'm not really paying attention to right now.

470
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,300
Honestly, I don't really care how it ends up.

471
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but like it's not really beneficial to me.

472
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,580
Whatever it does, whatever your YouTubers, your Twitter followers, your podcasts, whatever

473
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,700
they're saying about this case, it doesn't matter at the end of the day.

474
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Like I hate this.

475
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
This is the reality.

476
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
It doesn't matter.

477
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,660
It's going to be up to this judge.

478
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,340
And whatever happens will be a very interesting thing.

479
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,660
But we'll find out in a few months what happens with that.

480
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
So there you go.

481
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,660
All right.

482
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,220
Before we get to our gaming weeks, let me get to another couple of comments here.

483
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,100
Phoenix 7726 says, I kind of wonder how disco makes money at this point, Discord, not Star

484
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,220
Trek Discovery in this case, I think.

485
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,180
Those Nitro subs can't be that much.

486
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,860
They don't advertise and servers cost money to maintain.

487
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,540
I think they're making more Nitro subs than you might give them credit for.

488
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,820
I actually have the Nitro sub because I wanted to boost.

489
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,700
It only takes one person's boost to boost the server a little bit to get better voice

490
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
quality.

491
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,740
And I feel like I use it so much.

492
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,540
Maybe I ought to kick them a little bit of money, but I think it did come out not that

493
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
long ago.

494
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,140
That is where Discord's making a chunk of its money, but you're not wrong in thinking

495
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,660
they're probably not making enough money.

496
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,100
And we have a pair of stories coming up later that might give some insight into how are

497
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,820
they going to make more money later on.

498
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,540
We'll get into that a little later.

499
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,980
So DJ Rama S in chat says, plus investments from venture capitalists.

500
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, investments in the future is a big one.

501
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,260
And again, we have more coming up on that later.

502
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
So we'll get to that later.

503
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,580
But first, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

504
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,400
been playing this week and our impressions thereof.

505
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,900
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

506
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,300
What have you been playing?

507
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,540
I played a few more things than just Animal Crossing.

508
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,180
I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight and I've been streaming.

509
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,500
I actually had a fun, if me, terrible gameplay moment of going into Puddin's channel and

510
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,380
doing a custom game where it was a race to see if we could pop the hatch, close the hatch,

511
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:30,340
which starts the end game countdown, see if I could hook them before the timer went out,

512
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,460
which, of course, I failed.

513
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,180
I'm not very good.

514
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,180
That was pretty fun, though.

515
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,420
I think I'm going to do stuff like that in the future.

516
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,660
That's fun.

517
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,860
And then I also started Fantasia after last night's episode.

518
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,660
And I really like that game.

519
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,860
It really just smacks of old school SNES Final Fantasy stuff.

520
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,500
And it's the music is great.

521
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:00,860
I love that the backgrounds and objects are hand-built diorama pieces.

522
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,340
And you can really even on the rendered

523
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:09,060
stuff, you can see the texture built into those those other items.

524
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,660
And I love I love the story so far, too,

525
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,940
although I did think that the main character was a robot at first.

526
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,580
And I had a very sad moment right at the beginning, but I'm not going to spoil.

527
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,820
It's a fairly new game, but I'll be playing it on Tuesdays.

528
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,940
I'll have some information posted somewhere.

529
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,740
I forgot what my schedule is already.

530
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,220
But well, after OLR tonight is one of them.

531
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,180
Well, yeah, but after OLR tonight, I am debuting a

532
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,260
I mean, it's still me sucking it dead by daylight, but it has a fancy title now.

533
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,020
It's Monday Midnight Massacre, OK, because on the East Coast it'll be

534
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,060
Monday by the time we're pretty much done, OK?

535
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,980
I've even made music for it.

536
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,020
And some kind soul uploaded every sound

537
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,700
effect from one of the earlier builds of Dead by Daylight.

538
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,740
So I was able to incorporate some of it in my music.

539
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,300
But I wrote I did everything else myself.

540
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,340
I did the melody.

541
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,300
I did the

542
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,420
and it's an homage since I'm going to be playing Dead by Daylight.

543
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,380
It's an homage to the theme of the game.

544
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,780
Quite the musician lately.

545
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,340
Been doing great. I'm trying.

546
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,780
I mean, I've I've really enjoyed I mean,

547
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,660
I think that my streaming has pretty much

548
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:35,220
motivated me to get a lot better in Logic Pro, which is what I use to make my music.

549
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:41,140
And for those on stream who are watching watching with us live,

550
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:48,140
I have myself a nice new MIDI keyboard and it's an Akai Mini,

551
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,820
the MPK Mini, if anyone wants to know.

552
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,220
But I've had just a really, a really great time.

553
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,780
I feel like I've found some inspiration.

554
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,420
Love it.

555
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,460
Looking in chat over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network,

556
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,220
Phoenix 7726 is asking, have any of the hosts played the new Resident Evil?

557
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,100
I'm assuming Loki hasn't.

558
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,260
So I think it's a no from all of us.

559
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,940
But I did I know it's not the same as playing it.

560
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,020
But I did watch some Twitch streams of it for quite a bit of time.

561
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,820
Like I actually watched like at least an hour, if not a little more.

562
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,660
And I even watched a YouTube as well to kind of get a sense of it.

563
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,500
I'm I think it might be a little too intense for me just on the scare front

564
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,060
and all that stuff, like I just kind of know what I can handle and what might be

565
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,820
a bit much and some of those scenes I watched, although I think the characters

566
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,580
are really well done and, you know, knowing that, you know,

567
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,180
tying it back to Dead by Daylight, we know that Resident Evil is going to be

568
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,420
the next chapter and that there is going to be a new killer from the Resident Evil

569
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,940
series, I really don't mind if it's a killer from Resident Evil eight.

570
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,620
I know there are people out there that really want to have Wesker

571
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,940
or Mr. X or something.

572
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,900
There's a big rumor out there that it is the the witch trio from Resident Evil eight

573
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,820
is the killer because there's some hints in the video.

574
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,100
And the five for the fifth anniversary

575
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,500
looks like one of the hand size that the witch daughters use.

576
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,300
And I would be totally OK with that.

577
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,420
I think that would be a really cool killer.

578
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,020
I think Lady Dimitrescu we got I still wish we had a Code Veronica theme.

579
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,980
I as much as I know some people would just hate it.

580
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,140
I would love Lady Dimitrescu as a killer.

581
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,140
I just think like the idea of like a vampire, because we don't have a vampire

582
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,940
in Dead by Daylight yet, so it seems very, very fit.

583
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,900
So, I mean, we'll see. We'll see.

584
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,660
And obviously she is an iconic character, but we'll see.

585
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,140
Obviously, Resident Evil also has other icons.

586
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,300
You know, when it when you get to survivor, it gets a lot harder to choose.

587
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,620
And I wonder if it won't do the Stranger Things thing and actually give us

588
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,260
two survivors. I wonder if we won't have Chris and Jill or something.

589
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,180
But well, it's a matter of time.

590
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,940
We find out in a couple of weeks, right?

591
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,260
I think there are fifth anniversary streams in a couple of weeks.

592
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,220
So, yeah. All right.

593
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,100
Phoenix 7726 says, I bet a shitload of people want Lady D.

594
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,780
And then DJ Rama S says, just to be stepped on.

595
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,420
Yes, I think there are quite a few people that like to see it.

596
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,500
Whatever the reason is, I just I you know what?

597
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,980
If we're going to meme, let's fucking meme.

598
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,580
OK, like put her in dead by daylight and then let the user content flow, but we'll

599
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,780
see what happens, we'll see. All right.

600
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,300
Moving on with our gaming weeks, Loki.

601
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,660
All right, so this week it's it's been all

602
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,900
Minecraft for the most part, been still playing on the server stuff,

603
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,660
building more farms, staying up late, doing that kind of thing,

604
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,860
and then preparing to build my shop in the shopping district.

605
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,980
So lots of preparation, like on my creative

606
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,060
world, that's kind of a copy of the seed that they have.

607
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,020
So I've been designing it there so I can build it in the actual game.

608
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,340
So once that's done, I think that'll be kind of I don't know if that's going to be

609
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,980
part of episode two or episode three.

610
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,660
I haven't decided yet to go through all

611
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,740
the footage I have right now and see what I've got.

612
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,340
If it's enough content to do that, I would like to have that as a kind

613
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,540
of build montage in there, but maybe for another episode or something.

614
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,060
So we'll see.

615
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,020
But yeah, I just have to work more on the video editing stuff.

616
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,620
I know it's like.

617
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,740
I've got a nagging feeling, you know, it's

618
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,860
not outside of my mind any time I'm playing like I got to edit this video.

619
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,260
So hopefully that'll be coming soon.

620
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
I'm hoping sometime maybe next week.

621
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,340
And then aside from that, Orna just been playing more of that,

622
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,180
you know, taking over territories when I go places, that kind of thing.

623
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,700
Nice.

624
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
My gaming week, I also have been back in Orna a little bit.

625
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,020
I caught some areas out in the wilderness

626
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,900
that nobody had on my way up to Matt's place.

627
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,540
So that was fun.

628
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,500
And continuing with the GPS games, playing Pokemon Go.

629
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,620
I'm still not done with Meryl day.

630
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,580
And I've already up to five shinies, which is pretty good.

631
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,140
And a couple of good ones, too.

632
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,260
So I wish Meryl was a little bit of a better Pokemon in the meta game.

633
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,780
But maybe you guys know something. I don't.

634
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,740
Maybe Meryl's OK in the great league or something.

635
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,980
I don't know.

636
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,100
So I've been working on that a little bit.

637
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,820
Of course, I've been playing Dead by Daylight.

638
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,620
That's kind of my new.

639
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,940
This is the first week where I can say

640
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,660
I haven't played Final Fantasy 14 because all my friends left.

641
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,660
Shane's super into Monster Hunter with Dom.

642
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,100
Dominic, who we also play Final Fantasy 14 with.

643
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,180
I think Ray, who we also play that game with, went on a trip.

644
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,900
However,

645
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,780
the Final Fantasy 14 gang will reunite on Friday

646
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,700
because Fan Fest is, Virtual Fan Fest is Friday.

647
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,860
And yes, we already know about the expansion, but we're going to get the rest

648
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,020
of the details on the expansion on Friday.

649
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,860
What is the other class that is going to be in the game?

650
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,100
What are some of the other features?

651
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,140
So basically we get all the details of the expansion will be out on Friday.

652
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,620
If they allow us to co-stream, we may do another thing on VOG.

653
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,940
So you'll have to stay tuned to Twitter.

654
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,780
We don't know if it's allowable or not.

655
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,940
They kind of announced it at the last

656
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
minute last time and they'll probably do it this time.

657
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,380
But if it is allowed to co-stream, we will probably do that at VOG on Friday night.

658
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,660
So keep an eye out for it.

659
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,580
To which Bobby Blackwell says Final Fantasy 14 dead game.

660
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,180
No, it's just one of those, you know, we've kind of burned out this content.

661
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,700
We're ready for new stuff.

662
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,820
Everybody will be back once the new patch is out.

663
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,300
And Phoenix7726 says, I've heard that Final Fantasy 14 is doing better than WoW these days.

664
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,180
I really get the sense that is the case, too.

665
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,900
And I don't I don't want to pit the games

666
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,740
against each other because both have very strong, very loyal fan bases.

667
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,780
But I think this is just one of those things where

668
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,420
WoW has been getting outplayed a little bit because they've been very

669
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,020
comfortable being the leading MMO for a long time.

670
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,100
I don't think they're used to another company pushing out the content as

671
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,460
regular and that's one thing that 14 has done very well.

672
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,340
They're pushing out content regularly.

673
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,980
And that's something Blizzard's kind of slipped on and I think it's noticeable.

674
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,580
However, of course, we have WoW Classic.

675
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,380
There's a lot going on.

676
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,460
We'll talk about that later in the show and stuff.

677
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,420
And I don't mean to totally like I'm not trying to like shit on WoW or anything.

678
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,300
That's not what I'm trying to do.

679
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,100
They're both good games in their own regards.

680
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,100
But I just think that Blizzard, you know,

681
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,060
is getting challenged a little bit on the make more content front.

682
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,020
So anyhow,

683
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,460
the reason why I was saying all this, I haven't been playing 14.

684
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,140
I've been playing a little more Dead by Daylight to fill in the time.

685
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,340
Believe it or not, I'm playing I'm enjoying playing Survivor a lot more than I used to.

686
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,500
So I do go back and forth between Survivor and Killer.

687
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,340
I got my favorite Survivor and Jamie's least favorite.

688
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
No, I don't think it's your least favorite.

689
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,700
But you love to make fun of Dwight.

690
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,820
I love Dwight.

691
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,860
No, Dwight's just, Dwight's kind of generic.

692
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,020
The character I hate is Bill.

693
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,580
Oh, I don't care for Bill either.

694
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,140
You know, I think as much as everybody loves Ash from Evil Dead,

695
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,620
I think he's extraordinary.

696
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,460
Ash is terrible.

697
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,900
I think he's extraordinarily out of place in Dead by Daylight.

698
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,660
I got to be honest.

699
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,020
I was just watching people play him in his

700
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,980
perks and he is really difficult to be a good survivor on, especially as a starter.

701
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,020
Yeah, I mean, he's novel is what he is.

702
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,660
He's novel.

703
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,860
If there were any deadites in the game, then, yeah, I'd have more of a reason to be there.

704
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,380
But I think I'm working on the base survivors just to get their perks.

705
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,460
I'll probably I'm almost I'm level thirty nine on Dwight.

706
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,500
So I get his last perk in one more level and then I'll probably move on to a Meg.

707
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I'll probably just go right across top row, go to Meg, then go to Claudette,

708
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,460
then maybe go to Jake. I don't know if Jake has anything I really want, though.

709
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,300
I may go to Fengmen at that point.

710
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,820
If I do it, I'm actually going to start with Claudette.

711
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,300
I started I started with Claudette, too, so I could get self-care.

712
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,020
But then I realized that self-care is

713
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,180
kind of overrated because you're going to be flowing in medical kits.

714
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,420
So if you want to heal yourself, just bring a med kit.

715
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,180
Either that or I'm going to do the Meglet.

716
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,220
Yeah, Meg's Meg's makes a lot of fun, too.

717
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,260
So anyway, I've been doing that and playing survivor and killer.

718
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,260
I will say, too, I cameoed on Alan's stream on Wednesday.

719
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,460
So he does his Taylor Swift with friends.

720
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,500
That's what they call surviving with friends, SWF Swift.

721
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,940
So he did his Taylor Swift with friends

722
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,620
on Wednesday and I played for like two hours with him.

723
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,300
And I wasn't a total flop.

724
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,820
Like there was a couple of matches where he died and I didn't.

725
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,020
And that felt really good.

726
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,300
So it was good.

727
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,700
So, yeah, I've been playing lots of Dead by Daylight.

728
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,500
OK, have I been playing anything new, though?

729
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,140
Yes, I have something.

730
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,340
It's new to me, though.

731
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:31,140
It's not a new game, but it is new on Xbox because it just came out this week

732
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,140
on Xbox and it came out on Xbox Game Pass as a result of that.

733
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,820
So I have been spending quite a bit of time with Dragon Quest Builders, too.

734
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,140
So it's funny that Loki brought off mine,

735
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,740
brought up Minecraft because there's a lot of parallels, obviously.

736
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,660
Like, you know, there's a lot of the Minecraft

737
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,460
formula that you have in Dragon Quest Builders.

738
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,460
And I played quite a bit of the first game and I liked it a bit.

739
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,380
I didn't love it,

740
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,260
but I'm really enjoying my experience with Dragon Quest Builders, too.

741
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,340
The nice thing is, like most Dragon Quest games,

742
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,300
doesn't matter if you never played the first one.

743
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,420
Dragon Quest Builders, too, will help you out with the system and all that stuff.

744
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,740
And, you know, it starts you from scratch

745
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,780
and the stories don't really relate or anything.

746
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,940
So I think they may I think they actually might.

747
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,860
But it's OK if you don't know, like I'm not I'm not lost or anything in the story.

748
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,620
I think generally you're just kind of in that bad, good guy,

749
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,740
defeated bad guy a long time ago there, you're all caught up.

750
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,180
Like it's like that's that's all you need to know the first game.

751
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,700
And I'm I'm liking the fact that these

752
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,780
worlds you go to are really big and there's a lot to do.

753
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,340
And there's a lot more like creative share stuff in there.

754
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,140
I'm surprised some of the stuff that gets

755
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,460
on Square Enix's online platform in that game.

756
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,780
But all right. But yeah, I'm enjoying the game.

757
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,340
It's a very nice just kind of plop down and play for

758
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,820
almost hours because you start to lose sense of time.

759
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,860
And I'm I'm still in the first

760
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,500
not the not the shore you wash up on, but the first world after that, the farming

761
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,580
world, I'm still in that farming world and I've sunk quite a bit of time into the game.

762
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,740
So, yeah, it's

763
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,300
it's it's been enjoyable.

764
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,580
I like Dragon Quest Builders, too.

765
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,900
You know, ask me again. Ask me if I finish it.

766
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,780
Do I like it enough to finish it? We'll see.

767
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,860
I'll check that out.

768
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,540
Anyway, I know a lot of people were recommending that to me in Discord,

769
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,540
so good call on that because you're right, I enjoy the game.

770
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,180
So Dragon Quest Builders 2.

771
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,020
All right.

772
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,740
That's it for our gaming weeks.

773
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,900
So I think we will get into some other news.

774
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,420
So let's start with Loki.

775
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah, so this was a pleasant surprise.

776
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,060
We got a trailer from Nintendo for a brand new game called Game Builder Garage.

777
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,500
And what Game Builder Garage appears to be

778
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,300
is a lot of folks may not remember Labo.

779
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,100
So Labo, you have the games that were kind of included with it.

780
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,140
Hold on. Quarantine hasn't been that long.

781
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,980
Like Labo was like a toy.

782
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,900
OK, so what I mean by Labo is you may not know in Labo you can create your own things.

783
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,340
OK, so there is actually like programming

784
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,780
and stuff you can do within Labo that's kind of similar to this.

785
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,300
It's block based and you kind of, you know, drag stuff together to

786
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,100
basically create code.

787
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:19,620
And one key hit that this is based on that is I believe, if I remember correctly,

788
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:25,380
that robot that's in the trailer is actually in Labo, if I remember correctly.

789
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,220
But yeah, so basically it's kind of what they're doing is they're taking like

790
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,780
the programming that they had with Labo and basically bringing it to a broader

791
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,500
market to allow people to code and make their own games within it.

792
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,220
So that's pretty awesome that they do

793
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,820
that and they kind of walk you through on how to do stuff.

794
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,820
I think it's a great thing to get more

795
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,260
people into coding, even like the block based stuff.

796
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,660
I mean, Scratch, that's how a lot of people get started.

797
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,500
So it looks pretty cool.

798
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,900
It's supposed to be coming out, I think,

799
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,500
looks like in June, June 11th for 30 bucks.

800
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,580
What a pleasant surprise from Nintendo.

801
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,460
Very interesting.

802
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,940
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

803
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,260
You know, we haven't had any leaks or anything.

804
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,060
And also they're doing you know, this is again and this is not the first time

805
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,700
because they did this not that long ago with another game.

806
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
And I can't remember what it was in the moment, but somebody in shadow, correct me.

807
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,620
They're really only giving a five or six week lead time on this.

808
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,900
You know, it's kind of like, hey, you're thinking, was it Paper Mario?

809
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,420
Paper Mario? Yes, yes, very much with that.

810
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,420
And the other cool thing about this, too,

811
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,780
is because you were designing your own graphics and stuff like that,

812
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,860
they also have USB mouse support for it as well.

813
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,780
So you can plug it into the dock if you

814
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,860
have that set up to actually draw and stuff in there.

815
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,660
So that's pretty cool.

816
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,300
It sounds like this might be a very rich kind of system.

817
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,340
It's looking like it is because this is a successor of sorts to like Labo.

818
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,180
Like you say, I see the Mario Maker interest in this as well.

819
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,100
This is a very interesting path for Nintendo to be taking.

820
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,020
But I think this is great.

821
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,820
You know, it's their own kind of like dreams sort of thing.

822
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,900
And they seem to yeah, they seem to be pushing it more than Sony push Dreams.

823
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,180
I was talking about this at the end of Bobby's show is that I

824
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,380
it seems like a really crucial error that Sony did not push Dreams harder.

825
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm really shocked at that.

826
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,620
They really didn't.

827
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,860
It's such a good like piece of software, but it's just like nobody knows about it.

828
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,100
And like you can do like so much stuff with it.

829
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,180
It's just they didn't advertise it at all.

830
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,540
I hope that I hope they do a mulligan and we'll try to make a PS5 version that's

831
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,420
a little, you know, bigger, bigger, better, stronger,

832
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,380
and that it actually gets the promotion it deserves.

833
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
Because I don't I don't understand that at all.

834
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,820
Why Sony didn't push that the way they push LittleBigPlanet.

835
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,740
They did sort of I mean, they did cover it like it was in like several of their E3

836
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,580
events, but it was always like some weird like artsy thing that they did with it

837
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,220
where like they're controlling puppets or they're like playing music or something

838
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,940
like that. It doesn't really showcase.

839
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,180
Let me make it very plain.

840
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,980
Let me be very plain.

841
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,780
They didn't showcase Dreams the way Nintendo is showcasing this.

842
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,580
No, it is it is very clear what this is all about from the way Nintendo showcased

843
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,060
it, but Nintendo in many ways is also a master of messaging.

844
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,460
And that's not a knock on Sony.

845
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Sony's hell.

846
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,740
We all remember that E3 press conference when they showed those videos that just

847
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,660
dunked on Xbox and threw them out in the dumpster like it was it was shocking.

848
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,820
So we can't say the Sony Sony's great at messaging when they want to do it.

849
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,060
Nintendo's, you know, really, really, really good at it.

850
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,140
And Microsoft, you know, as much as that event was 10 years ago and a lot's changed

851
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,860
with Microsoft and Microsoft's great at messaging in their own way as well.

852
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,660
But my my my real point is, is that, you know,

853
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,660
Sony should have pushed dreams more.

854
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,180
And I think with this and Nintendo, we get the short time frame.

855
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,220
But I think there's going to be a big audience for this.

856
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,180
Again, it's kind of like one of those like game.

857
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,340
I didn't know I needed until you showed it to me.

858
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,260
Even I'm interested in it and I don't

859
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,380
necessarily sit there and make a lot of games, but I kind of want to play other

860
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,460
people's games, and that's the other thing that's interesting about Nintendo is

861
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,340
that, you know, we're seeing all these comments in chat.

862
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
S.H.A. 100 Matt saying, I'm waiting for

863
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,940
someone to make a recreation of Mother 3 in this.

864
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,820
And just as the person goes to share it, the game deletes it.

865
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,380
DJ Rama S says, finally, O.L.R. the RPG.

866
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,300
Bobby Blackwolf says, everyone's like, don't like your minimum wage job.

867
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,700
Learn to code, lol.

868
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,060
So now they can learn to code.

869
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,580
And then they're like, we're short staff.

870
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,620
Nobody wants to work for us.

871
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,820
Well, that's a that's that's a whole other Oprah, as they say.

872
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,260
But great game.

873
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,780
They can release your game, make no money off of it and still have your job.

874
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,700
There you go. Well, yeah, the Nintendo thing.

875
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,820
Well, I'm I'm it seems almost certain you're not going to make money off these games.

876
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
No, of course not.

877
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,660
And I think also one thing we kind of know

878
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,980
about it is that you're going to be able to share your creations with friends.

879
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,380
But it doesn't sound like they have a public

880
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,660
posting forum like Mario Maker or something.

881
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,100
Well, we could be wrong.

882
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,900
We don't have all the details yet.

883
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm hoping that they have like sort of codes.

884
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,060
I mean, they love their codes.

885
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,460
You know, if they have some sort of share thing.

886
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,660
But like, it would be nice if it was like a little big planet

887
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,740
where I could search for something and find things.

888
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,980
But like, I doubt it.

889
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,060
I doubt it, too.

890
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,780
We're talking about.

891
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,780
But again, here is where and yet again, and here's where I'll knock Nintendo.

892
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,260
So they're a master of messaging.

893
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,180
But yet again, they always flop online.

894
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,940
So here comes Discord.

895
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,940
Here comes Twitter to save their butt in that regard.

896
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,420
Well, and maybe make the problem worse in this case.

897
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
But everybody's going to share their codes on Discord.

898
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,460
Everybody's going to share.

899
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,300
Well, we will have to make a room on the VOG Network Discord.

900
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,380
I'm happy to do it on the VOG Network Discord over at VOG Network dot com

901
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,660
slash Discord. Cheap plug.

902
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,980
But join us. I'll have to make a room.

903
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,060
That's codes for the game center.

904
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,180
What the hell is this called?

905
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,140
Garage center games. God damn it.

906
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,500
What's it called? Garage games.

907
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,900
Yeah. Garage game build or garage or game builder garage.

908
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,300
Sorry. Garage garage garage.

909
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,780
God damn it. Something garage, something builder.

910
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,620
Yeah, that it's it's just it's it's avenue for people to draw

911
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,420
ballacies flying through the air and share that.

912
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,140
Well, how long until we'll do that?

913
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,020
How long until someone makes the penis game immediately and shares it?

914
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,700
I will see you in four weeks when we talk about the penis games

915
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,580
and Nintendo having to crack down on that for weeks.

916
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,940
You guys, that's that's about how much time we need.

917
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,660
That'll be about the release date. And

918
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,660
yeah.

919
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,380
See you in four weeks when we talk about how people abuse nice things

920
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,740
and why we can't have them.

921
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,300
Dark Sakura, you've been quiet, but I know you like your creative

922
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,540
outlets on Nintendo.

923
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,860
Hello, Animal Crossing.

924
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,620
Any interest in this garage game builder game?

925
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,820
Really? Yeah.

926
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,540
With this, I don't really enjoy Mario Maker either.

927
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,340
So I mean, I don't want to make my own game.

928
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,500
I just want to have a game that I can be creative within its universe.

929
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,020
Interesting. OK.

930
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,140
Yeah, this this this isn't really my kind of thing.

931
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,260
I like I like, you know, playing Sims

932
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,620
because it's in there with the set rules of that universe.

933
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,780
I don't want.

934
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,060
I don't want my game to be work.

935
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,660
OK, I just don't want to think like that.

936
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,700
I want to if I'm going to if I'm going to be creative

937
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,500
in a more abstract sense, it's going to be doing something

938
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,620
that I want to do for me.

939
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,260
That's why I like to make music.

940
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,940
That's why she recreate pixel poops in there.

941
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,620
But you should talk to Aaron about that.

942
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,260
Bobby Bockel from Chad says she doesn't want to make a game.

943
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,380
She wants other people to make her ideas.

944
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,700
Well, now that's a different topic.

945
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,180
That's completely different.

946
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,660
And I actually get your point, Jamie, because I don't play a game to work.

947
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,260
I I get the whole fact that like you can choose your tool to make art.

948
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,540
You can paint with oil, you can paint with watercolor,

949
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,700
you can paint with crayons, you know, whatever it is.

950
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,060
And so you like to paint in an Animal Crossing universe

951
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,420
where there are certain like boundaries and things like it,

952
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,620
not just Animal Crossing, but this example right where there's no.

953
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,460
Go how long I sit looking at logic before I actually get started on something.

954
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,900
Oh, I'm sure a long time I do the same.

955
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,060
Exactly. I don't want to do that with a video game.

956
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,780
Like if I go into the Sims, I know what's there in front of me.

957
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,540
And so I have the tools to work with, you know, it's like

958
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,300
if you are going to be constructing a house,

959
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,940
you know what tools you're going to be working with.

960
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,140
You've got those parameters.

961
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,780
I don't want to sit and have to rack my brain.

962
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,260
And on top of that, I just it doesn't interest me.

963
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,820
It really doesn't. I want to play a game.

964
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,020
I don't want to make the game.

965
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,180
I also like I get it because like I will I will probably buy this game,

966
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,780
but to play other people's games,

967
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,420
probably not to make anything of substance of my own, because I'm just not sure.

968
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,700
Maybe maybe the creative spark will bite.

969
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,100
You never know. Never say never.

970
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,540
But like but yet I just talked about Dragon Quest builders, too.

971
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,940
And I'm having fun building little houses, building little structures

972
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,060
and doing things a little bit outside of the lines of what the game is telling me

973
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,420
and kind of like doing my own thing in that universe.

974
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,300
I'm having a good time with it.

975
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,900
So I actually I actually relate to what you're saying, Jamie. I really do.

976
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,660
But I will probably still buy the game to play other people's games.

977
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,980
That's the difference.

978
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,220
So, yeah, but it would be it would be nice

979
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,980
if Nintendo would just put out a player, then, you know, best of both worlds.

980
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,060
Right. So. All right.

981
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,580
Anyway, but that is that is a pleasant surprise out of Nintendo.

982
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,900
And again, only like five weeks away. That's very surprising. Yeah.

983
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,980
And that's also like June 11th.

984
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,060
That's probably right smack dab

985
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,660
in the center of when E3 quote quote stuff is going on.

986
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,980
Yeah. Yeah, it would be.

987
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,780
So that's also an interesting timing for that.

988
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,460
And I bet Nintendo is probably going to dedicate a few treehouse hours

989
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,100
to that game, even though it will be coming out at that time.

990
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,540
They've done this before.

991
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,700
There was another game that came out like the week of E3,

992
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,980
and they were still showing it.

993
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,460
And I don't remember in the moment arms.

994
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,340
I think you're right. It was arms.

995
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,020
I think it was arms. So anyway.

996
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,740
Bobby Blackwell says the 11th is a Friday.

997
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,940
Isn't the E3 stuff the next week?

998
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,420
I might be wrong, but I think the E3 stuff is the next week.

999
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,660
Like it's like the 13th, 14th, something like that.

1000
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,580
Of course, the 13th will be a Sunday.

1001
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,740
So I could be wrong, but it is the.

1002
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,660
Yeah, it starts Saturday.

1003
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,140
So it's the day after is when E3 starts.

1004
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,460
Oh, that's right.

1005
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,260
It's not the usual timetable this year anyway, because it's virtual.

1006
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,020
Oh, no, no, no change every year.

1007
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,780
Well, they've also sometimes the press conferences

1008
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,180
have started that far in advance as well.

1009
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,260
I remember that. But anyway.

1010
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,980
I just think it's interesting that it's so close to all of that.

1011
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,700
So just want you to know that the game awards were actually part of E3.

1012
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,500
It's just they started like six months in advance of E3.

1013
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,540
It's fine. No, no. Game awards are summer game fest.

1014
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,220
There's a difference.

1015
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,220
Loki can't camp.

1016
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,900
Keeley has his own thing.

1017
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,940
It's all part of the E3.

1018
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,860
That just takes place several months after E3. It's fine.

1019
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,820
All right. Let's talk about.

1020
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,940
OK, maybe maybe game garage builder camp thing is not up Dark Soccer's alley.

1021
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,820
But I know this one is.

1022
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,420
And it's releasing this Friday.

1023
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,260
It's the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is coming out this Friday.

1024
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,940
Dark Soccer, you have your all yours preordered and ready to go.

1025
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,500
No, no. Are you not?

1026
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,660
Because I said I'm going to get it.

1027
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,380
But I need to get my Windows virtual virtualization set up,

1028
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,940
which means I'm probably going to have to dish out the funds for

1029
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,620
for parallels

1030
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,620
because they've got a Windows arm for free that works now on the M1 Mac Mini.

1031
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,420
And all of my other games I've been playing have looked terrific.

1032
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,500
So I'm going to have to make sure that it's going to work for me playing it.

1033
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,340
And I don't want to get it through Stadia is the issue.

1034
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,460
I mean, and I do eventually want to get my Dead by Daylight stuff linked for

1035
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,500
on Steam as well so that I can just pick up where I left off.

1036
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,060
Yeah, that'll be that'll be nice.

1037
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,900
You'll get that benefit where I didn't coming from Xbox one.

1038
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,460
But that'll be nice.

1039
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,700
But anyway, well, I actually haven't preordered mine

1040
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,820
because I know I'm just going to walk into Target and get it.

1041
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,900
That's kind of what I do now.

1042
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,020
Like, I don't I don't trust games to deliver on time.

1043
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,700
I just I just go into Target and get them.

1044
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,980
But I I'm definitely going to pick up the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.

1045
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,180
I'll probably get it on Xbox one just because that's excuse me, Xbox Series X,

1046
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,420
because that's my most advanced console I have right now.

1047
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,620
And I played the original on Xbox 360 first.

1048
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,260
So it's kind of like it was kind of my home base for Mass Effect.

1049
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,300
And yes, this means I will be buying Mass Effect three for the fifth time.

1050
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,460
Shut up. But let's talk about the original Mass Effect,

1051
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
because that's where the most exciting changes are coming,

1052
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,460
is that they're really kind of given an overhaul to the first Mass Effect game

1053
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
to kind of catch it up to where two and three were.

1054
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,500
And of course, one of those quality of life changes is the Mako

1055
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,060
and driving that that's the car in Mass Effect.

1056
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,420
And it wasn't a lot of fun to drive.

1057
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,500
I don't remember hating it, but I remember thinking like this thing is a pain in the ass

1058
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,100
and they've they've fixed it.

1059
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,340
However, if you are a purist and you insist

1060
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,900
on driving the Mako the original way, good news.

1061
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,260
In an interview with PC Gamer, Kevin Meek from BioWare said,

1062
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,940
we've left the option to leave it back kind of closer to the original controls

1063
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,020
as well, if you want for those people out there who do like pain.

1064
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,140
Suffering. I love that he said that about his own game.

1065
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,060
But that you know what?

1066
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,780
You know what? There's always going to be that there's always that person

1067
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,580
on social media that's going to be like, I like the old way better.

1068
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:10,780
It was better the way it was before, even though everybody else dunked on it.

1069
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,740
There's going to be somebody that's going to say the old way was better.

1070
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,540
Well, guess what?

1071
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,260
Person, the ooh, she's different person on Twitter.

1072
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,700
Guess what? You get to have it both ways if you want.

1073
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,100
So that's the big news this week.

1074
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,140
Yeah. And I'm excited to play the legendary edition in a few days.

1075
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,340
That'll probably make up a chunk of my gaming week next week.

1076
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,620
I'm still a little sad there's no multiplayer, but I get it.

1077
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,100
I understand why that's not an option.

1078
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,660
All right. Phoenix 7726 says the galactic readiness

1079
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,420
in three will be significantly changed as well.

1080
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,620
Yeah, excuse me. Yeah, they're going to have to because there is no multiplayer.

1081
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,340
And I don't think the phone app is going to be a thing anymore.

1082
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,060
Excuse me. So I think they already said it's going to be much more based

1083
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,460
on like the things you did and didn't do earlier on in the trilogy

1084
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,380
and in the game three.

1085
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,380
Act Efton Chat says, Wait, Rob, you're not getting a copy for each console?

1086
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,020
No, you have to remember the reason why did I really buy Mass Effect

1087
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,660
three so many times?

1088
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,020
The multiplayer.

1089
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,820
There was no cross play back then.

1090
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,540
And I had people I wanted to play PlayStation on.

1091
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,700
I had people I wanted to play PC on.

1092
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,300
I had people I want to play Xbox on.

1093
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,580
So that was kind of the reason.

1094
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,060
Also, it really helps that Wii U version was on sale like dirt cheap.

1095
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,020
That's when I picked that up.

1096
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,700
And I think the PlayStation trilogy was on sale when I bought it, too.

1097
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,900
So because there's no multiplayer,

1098
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,020
I really don't see the need to get this on any other console.

1099
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,820
And I don't think I will.

1100
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,460
Never say never, I guess.

1101
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,460
Let's see.

1102
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,420
What was the other

1103
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,420
comment here? Oh, SD100Matt said,

1104
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,300
Will we see you stream any of it, Rob?

1105
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,300
I hadn't considered it because I didn't think people wanted to see it.

1106
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,060
But since you asked so nicely.

1107
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,300
Sure, I probably yeah, I can do a stream Friday night after work

1108
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,100
and do several hours of the first Mass Effect game

1109
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,860
and look at some of the changes.

1110
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,620
Streaming narrative games and RPGs is a little weird for me.

1111
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,780
I know other people do it. I know Dark Sakura is doing it.

1112
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,620
But for me, it's a little weird

1113
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,540
because I always feel like when you kind of pick up something in the middle,

1114
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,380
it's a lot harder to follow.

1115
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,340
But I like to do those first night games.

1116
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,380
And so, yeah.

1117
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,460
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says if it goes to play, I might think about it.

1118
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,540
It probably will eventually, but that could be a couple of years out.

1119
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,740
Keep in mind, the original trilogy is already on play.

1120
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,980
And I think it's interesting they didn't remove it or anything.

1121
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,340
So if you want to play the originals, is Mass Effect three on it?

1122
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,180
I don't recall. I know one and two are.

1123
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,300
But interesting.

1124
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:50,940
Dr.

1125
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,940
Tzuyu says, I hear there might be new DMCA concerns with the Mass Effect remaster.

1126
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,020
Saw something on Twitter that the music's in the library now.

1127
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,220
Well, they have until Friday to fix it.

1128
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,980
They did have a couple of licensed songs in the game, too.

1129
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,580
So that could also be messing with it a little bit.

1130
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,900
So, you know, play with the volume low in certain parts, especially the credits.

1131
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,100
Phoenix 7726 says, I wonder why they stripped out the multiplayer from three.

1132
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,660
They've commented on it.

1133
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,420
And it's basically that

1134
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,900
it wasn't the point of the remaster and it would have been extra resources

1135
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
to do all that.

1136
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,220
And so they they kind of left it.

1137
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,540
I would I wish they would do, you know, especially because the Mass Effect

1138
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,500
whatever project they're working on now that was announced

1139
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,060
at the Game Awards a couple of years ago, that project,

1140
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,860
we're not going to see until like 2024, probably.

1141
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,300
Let's be real. It's going to be a lot.

1142
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,380
We still don't have the fucking new Dragon Age game.

1143
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,260
And how long have they been talking about that?

1144
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,180
So that Mass Effect game, it ain't happening for a long time.

1145
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,980
It would be very nice if as a bridge in between, there was a multiple.

1146
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,100
And I've been seeing this for a goddamn long time.

1147
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,220
If they just had a multiplayer only game,

1148
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,660
a Mass Effect multiplayer only game in the universe, a 40 dollar game or something.

1149
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,020
Hell, do 20 dollars and charge for boxes or whatever.

1150
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,660
I still miss that. Like fucking people will play it.

1151
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,100
Dark Sakura will play it, like, you know,

1152
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,180
and she doesn't play a lot of multiplayer games that I can think of.

1153
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,300
So do it anyway.

1154
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,940
Phoenix 7726 says the question about that project is after the train wreck

1155
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,380
that was Andromeda, does anyone believe it could work?

1156
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,500
I feel like Andromeda's.

1157
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Yes, is the short answer.

1158
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,380
I feel like Andromeda has also gained a lot of favor with people

1159
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,860
the longer it's been around.

1160
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,260
I think you're seeing more and more people kind of come up and say,

1161
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,660
you know, Andromeda was done dirty.

1162
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,380
And that's exactly the point I've been saying since day one.

1163
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,340
Andromeda was done dirty.

1164
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,020
That game wasn't fucking finished when they released it.

1165
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,380
Now that it's finished, it's actually not bad.

1166
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,420
Yeah, it's a little different because it's in another universe.

1167
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,820
It's it's weird to get it.

1168
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,140
But if you really look at it as what it is at this point, a side story,

1169
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,900
a side adventure, a Star Wars, Rogue One, if you will, it's fine.

1170
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,580
I want to play through that again, too.

1171
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,340
So anyway. All right.

1172
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,580
Enough Mass Effect chat because we could go on for three hours just about that.

1173
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,540
Let's talk about a chatting program, Dark Sakura.

1174
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,540
I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.

1175
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,220
Dark Sakura is next.

1176
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:29,180
Sorry. Well, and I think that maybe a lot of people have even noticed this already.

1177
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:34,060
But Discord, which I mean, we use for how we communicate

1178
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,220
with each other for the show.

1179
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,740
So hi, we're an example.

1180
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,260
We're literally on it right now. Yes. Yeah.

1181
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,980
It's been really moving.

1182
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,020
Well, I wouldn't say past gaming communities,

1183
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,380
but it's expanding out into other other genre.

1184
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,300
There's non gaming specific servers like to focus on TV.

1185
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,500
I'm in one for Supernatural and there's role play groups and there's

1186
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:08,180
discussions and things for fantasy fucking football and dating even.

1187
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,460
There's groups for fans of TV shows to get together and watch it in Discord

1188
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,980
so they can watch throughout the the pandemic while they're quarantined.

1189
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,780
I know. I know people that pirate drag race that way.

1190
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:27,140
Basically, they have their view parties for drag race that they don't,

1191
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,540
you know, like an East Coast friend streams it so the West Coast

1192
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,540
friends can watch it. I'm not saying I've ever done it.

1193
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,900
I just know that that's the thing.

1194
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,260
Well, and one of the things that makes Discord special is that

1195
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,260
they're not funded from ads, they don't make any money from ads.

1196
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,340
They make their money through Nitro, which is a service

1197
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,420
that's either $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year.

1198
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,900
That gives some extra features like a high res video,

1199
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,500
animated emoji, a few other things.

1200
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,340
But I mean, but right now

1201
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:06,220
they have more than 140 million monthly active viewers.

1202
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:12,260
And I mean, but in 2019, it was at 56 million.

1203
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,900
So it is already practically tripled. Yeah.

1204
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,900
19 million weekly active servers.

1205
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,260
So, I mean, it's pretty, pretty crazy.

1206
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:29,140
So but now I mean, like some professors

1207
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,020
are using it to to teach their classes.

1208
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,580
And then, of course, Microsoft was interested

1209
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,740
in buying a Discord for about 10 million.

1210
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,060
This was in March. Yep.

1211
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,260
But instead, now they have a partnership with Sony,

1212
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,380
which we'll get into next.

1213
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,580
Yeah. But the thing, it's customizable.

1214
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,740
A lot of people find it as an attractive alternative to using Slack.

1215
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,700
And Slack, don't get me wrong, Slack is great

1216
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,300
for businesses and nonprofits.

1217
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,380
I think that there's a lot more freedom for an open chat

1218
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,660
forum using Discord than using Slack.

1219
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,500
Yeah, we still use Slack for Ingress stuff, too.

1220
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,460
Like when we had Slack at work, we had the big event in Ingress

1221
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,060
in here in October, and we used Slack heavily for that,

1222
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,340
for the planning and all that stuff.

1223
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,900
I'm sorry, October before the pandemic, October 2019.

1224
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,060
And yeah, I do like the threading that Slack has better over Discord.

1225
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,100
But there.

1226
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,940
I think Discord is better for a broader audience.

1227
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,660
Does that make sense?

1228
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,260
The biggest thing that Slack really has is those integrations,

1229
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,900
and you can integrate to a level. Discord has bots,

1230
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,860
but you can integrate Slack to a little bit of a stronger degree

1231
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,380
than you can Discord, if that makes sense.

1232
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,780
At least my perception is, based on the stuff I've seen,

1233
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,980
is that bots are cool, but they're bots.

1234
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,380
The integrations you do on Discord, or excuse me, on Slack

1235
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,260
go a little bit further.

1236
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,380
So well, the thing, the really big thing to

1237
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,580
to get from this, though,

1238
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,740
is that with that exponential growth as it is,

1239
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,420
I mean, and this is in about a year and a half, about.

1240
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,060
We're seeing all these other forums pop up on here,

1241
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,020
and of course, Discord ain't mad about it.

1242
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,700
But I think that it's almost like how we were seeing things happen

1243
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,660
with YouTube, right?

1244
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,740
Where it was just, oh, these people's videos.

1245
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:40,100
Now we have like entire shows and music video releases and this and that.

1246
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,700
We're definitely seeing Discord become

1247
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,220
I mean, I think at its core, it's still the gamers, right?

1248
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,220
Yeah. Yeah. But but I think that there's room for everybody

1249
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,740
in that play box, in that sandbox. Absolutely.

1250
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,180
Bob Coffey in our chat says all Discord is, is IRC with embedded cat pictures.

1251
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,500
Respectfully, no. Much better.

1252
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,860
Yeah, I get it, because what you described is kind of slack.

1253
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:13,460
Here's the thing that Discord has that slack doesn't and and an IRC doesn't.

1254
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,260
Look, we're doing it right now.

1255
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,740
This show, video chat, able to do this whole thing,

1256
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,220
and if we wanted to, I could probably bring I mean,

1257
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,140
I have to have the layouts for it and everything, but I could.

1258
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,780
Well, I've done it before when I brought like Delvin or Shane or somebody

1259
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,020
on here as a fourth chair and Jamie and I have been talking offline

1260
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,900
about having some more fourth chairs in the future from the community and so forth.

1261
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,580
So we might, you know, we can do that all through Discord.

1262
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,980
And that, you know, especially now in the pandemic era,

1263
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,780
that's something that IRC really couldn't bring us.

1264
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,060
IRC still had bots and all that cool stuff.

1265
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,060
Whoever played Acrophobia and that stuff on IRC, right?

1266
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,740
So you still had some of that stuff.

1267
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,700
But the big, big difference, and I think really why Discord is going

1268
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,420
to the moon right now, especially in the pandemic,

1269
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,380
this pandemic has been a terrible thing.

1270
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,980
But let's be real, some companies have made a lot of fucking money off of it.

1271
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,260
And I'm not just talking about pharmacies.

1272
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,540
I'm talking about Zoom.

1273
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,460
Big one, right? The number one probably.

1274
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,220
And this Discord has done very well because of the pandemic.

1275
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,260
But isn't it kind of cool that like people that you never thought

1276
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,500
would use video chat software are kind of able to use it now?

1277
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,980
Like it's a very, if I can tell my, I can tell my 82 year old dad

1278
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,740
to do a Zoom call and he knows how to do it.

1279
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,340
Yeah. That's it's become a necessity.

1280
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,300
Yeah. And this is what our culture is now.

1281
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:45,180
Now in chat, they're kind of having a side conversation here.

1282
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,340
Phoenix 7726 asked, how does Microsoft solution compare?

1283
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,380
And DJ Rama said it was Teams.

1284
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,620
Bobby says it's Microsoft Teams.

1285
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,100
And to be fair, I can't evaluate it.

1286
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,940
I've never used it.

1287
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,220
I use it at work.

1288
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,500
It's all right. It's all right.

1289
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,980
It's kind of, it's kind of very similar to Slack, isn't it?

1290
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:09,580
It's not even really, it's more of like, um, I think of like an instant

1291
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,740
messenger more and you can share, like, it feels like an instant messenger to

1292
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,260
me and you can share like stuff.

1293
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:19,340
You can have chats, you can call people through it and do meetings,

1294
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,820
but it's, it's not, it doesn't feel like Discord at all.

1295
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,420
Yeah.

1296
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,500
I mean, it's sort of set up, I guess.

1297
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,940
It's just a guest appearance, but yeah, you can set up different groups and

1298
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,500
stuff like that and have discussions.

1299
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,300
I don't know if you can do groups within groups.

1300
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,420
Maybe you can, I don't know.

1301
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,140
But, um,

1302
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,620
Isn't Teams like a kind of almost like a step ahead from Skype because at my,

1303
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,780
okay, so at my business, we use Skype for business.

1304
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,380
Um, so we're still on that, like to chat and, and do the stuff we

1305
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,340
need desktop share and stuff.

1306
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,340
But, um, uh, I keep seeing things about getting upgraded to Teams.

1307
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,300
So I think that might be coming in the future because I think

1308
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,900
that's the next progression, but we'll see.

1309
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:57,420
We'll see.

1310
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,420
Yeah, probably.

1311
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:59,140
Yeah.

1312
01:05:59,660 --> 01:05:59,980
All right.

1313
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,340
Anyhow.

1314
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,660
Um, so dark soccer referenced something there that I know you

1315
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,820
were going to elaborate on Loki.

1316
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:05,700
Yeah.

1317
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,580
So, um, Discord now is going to be integrated a little bit with, uh,

1318
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,500
PlayStation.

1319
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,780
So this is coming from the fact that Sony has actually invested a

1320
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,900
minority stake in Discord itself.

1321
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,060
And the company's plan to bring Discord and PlayStation experiences closer

1322
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:27,780
together on console and mobile starting early next year, and apparently

1323
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,540
they're working hard on connecting Discord with, uh, the social and gaming

1324
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,860
experiences of PlayStation network.

1325
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,300
I'm guessing maybe that'll show like which games you're playing.

1326
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:41,740
Maybe some sort of cross talk between, um, I don't know, like

1327
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,300
the mate chat rooms and stuff.

1328
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,540
It'd be nice to see it for them integrate that.

1329
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,780
Cause aren't they getting rid of like the party chat and stuff like

1330
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,260
that, or they're doing something with it.

1331
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,820
Well, they got rid of communities already.

1332
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:51,900
Communities.

1333
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,820
So maybe this is replacing communities.

1334
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,500
Um, be interesting to see if that's, that's what they're doing with it.

1335
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,460
Um, but yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1336
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,460
It sounds cool.

1337
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,300
I can't wait to see what they do with it.

1338
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,700
I think it's important to remember that Microsoft also has kind of a partnership

1339
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,500
with Discord, um, and that is that if you like link your Xbox account with your

1340
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:20,620
Discord account, that, um, I think there's some benefits that crossover, don't quote

1341
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,140
me on that.

1342
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:26,540
Um, but, uh, namely also, and this is the big one is that if I'm playing a game on

1343
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,100
Xbox, you see it on discord, you know how like on discord, you can see so-and-so is

1344
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,580
currently streaming or it says so-and-so is playing dead by daylight, which mine

1345
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:39,020
probably says a lot, but if I'm on Xbox, I imagine it also will say is playing

1346
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,140
Dragon Quest builders too.

1347
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:40,780
Like it does that.

1348
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,380
And so when I first read this story that I was kind of like, I think people are

1349
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,220
going crazy with, it sounds like PlayStation is just doing the same thing.

1350
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,700
And they're, they're integrating discord in that regard.

1351
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,780
Um, but it actually sounds like maybe PlayStation is planning to go a step

1352
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,420
further with this, that like, now we really see, oh, this is why they got rid

1353
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,340
of communities real fast.

1354
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,540
You know, they didn't give a lot of warning on the communities going away.

1355
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:07,060
It, maybe there really is going to be some integration within the console itself.

1356
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,100
It would be exciting to see what they do.

1357
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,820
If they actually would just talk about it, you know, then we can figure it out and be

1358
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,500
excited about it, but nope, let's keep it a secret forever.

1359
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,260
Yeah, be interesting.

1360
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,020
So maybe we'll find out more about this.

1361
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,060
This could be the type of thing that Sony unveils in an E3 timeframe.

1362
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,820
I know I say that a lot, but you know, it's, it's not far away.

1363
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,900
And especially if Sony has sunsetted communities as fast as they've done, I

1364
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,540
think they're already planning something.

1365
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,220
So we'll see.

1366
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,740
Um, well, maybe, maybe, okay.

1367
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,660
Maybe not so fast because some folks in chat, I guess, saw something I missed

1368
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:48,060
as Joe and her mat says, we apparently won't see anything with it until 2022.

1369
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,500
Probably because the PlayStation firmware takes that long to update, honestly.

1370
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,860
Uh, and act-def says, there's gotta be some PlayStations to put it on, you know, so,

1371
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,140
uh, act-def says the thing is that considering this isn't coming anytime

1372
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,260
soon, it seems that there is more.

1373
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:08,500
So maybe we'll see kind of maybe we'll see like as a small first step.

1374
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:12,780
That whole, you know, what you plan kind of connection that Xbox has.

1375
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:17,100
And then maybe there will be more to it in, in 2022, like some actual

1376
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,700
integration within the console itself.

1377
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:23,300
That'd be very interesting and very good news for Discord, who did not, is,

1378
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,980
is venturing it alone and plans to be its own company and probably

1379
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,420
its own IPO at some point.

1380
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,580
Way down the line, way down the line.

1381
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,060
All right.

1382
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,020
Excuse me.

1383
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:40,140
Let's talk about this next story, which has to do with summer games done quick.

1384
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,900
I can't believe we're already at the point we're talking

1385
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,340
about summer games done quick.

1386
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:49,100
This year has, like, weren't we just done with awesome games done quick?

1387
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:53,180
Like this year is just like flown by, but, uh, a lot of people, of

1388
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,860
course, look forward to these weeks.

1389
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,060
Not only are they a great charity event, but they're just a

1390
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,300
lot of fun to watch, right?

1391
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:02,300
Uh, speed running is, uh, it's, it's almost a sport of a sport within

1392
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,700
of the video game community.

1393
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:08,300
Uh, and people can watch it, uh, a lot, just like they consume something like ESPN.

1394
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,860
So, uh, summer games done quick 2021 has, uh, basically released

1395
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:16,820
all the games that will be played during summer games done quick.

1396
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,580
Now, the difference here, this is not the, what is being played

1397
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,300
when list that comes later.

1398
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,900
This is just the list of basically like what's been accepted.

1399
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,100
So it's alphabetical.

1400
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,940
Um, there's still a lot of stuff to be determined about summer games done quick.

1401
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,700
Uh, for example, I believe our pal Bobby Black Wolf doesn't yet

1402
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,340
know about the hosting thing.

1403
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,460
Uh, I think there's still a little time on that.

1404
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,340
Uh, and, uh, some of the other things they have to figure out.

1405
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,340
Um, and yes, uh, is pointed out that summer games done quick is still going

1406
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,700
to be virtual and that they announced that sometime ago, I think though, they

1407
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,900
still have a skeleton crew at, at the home base hotel, um, that's kind

1408
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,460
of like the master control switch.

1409
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,500
And honestly, now that, you know, vaccines are a thing, you got a lot more

1410
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,220
States that are opening up in mid June.

1411
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,340
I don't think that whole notion is as dangerous as it once was, but there is

1412
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:11,860
probably still some hesitancy about, can we get 500 people in a room to watch this?

1413
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,700
That that's the part where I think there's still a lot of hesitancy there.

1414
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,820
So, um, yeah, yeah.

1415
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:21,460
Uh, anyhow, uh, yeah, Bobby says they always have a skeleton crew

1416
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,300
that runs the stream in Virginia.

1417
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,300
I remember that cause you talked about it on previous show.

1418
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,900
Anyway, the list is out.

1419
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,860
It's way too long for me to read everything on it, but some

1420
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,020
things that caught my eye.

1421
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,620
I love me some Bayonetta.

1422
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:36,260
Uh, the Batman video games on NES and Genesis.

1423
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,980
I thought it was cute that they kind of have both of those going on there.

1424
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:44,780
Uh, cave story, 3d, uh, not too, uh, a recent ish, uh, game classic game of the

1425
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,060
week, uh, you know, we love our Bemani.

1426
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,700
Uh, that's where our roots are here at orange lounge radio.

1427
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,940
Uh, and they've got dance rush stardom.

1428
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,180
That's that's the new one with the fancy floor.

1429
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,860
That's the new one.

1430
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,340
I see that.

1431
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:56,740
Yeah.

1432
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,380
That's the new one with the floor that, um, I I'm not coordinated enough to play.

1433
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,220
I've tried playing it.

1434
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,260
And the reality is when the show started, I was in my twenties

1435
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,300
and now I'm in my forties.

1436
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,300
So a little different.

1437
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:11,100
They're doing a dance show, disposable income someday.

1438
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,060
You know, I'll have to get one of those.

1439
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:14,420
Yeah.

1440
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,820
Well, anyway, you get to see an hour and a half of a dance showcase, uh, played

1441
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,980
by Iji Ken, if I said that name, right.

1442
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,100
I'm sorry if I mispronounced the name.

1443
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,260
They're going to be amazing.

1444
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,140
Um, it looks like they're doing a destiny to raid of sorts.

1445
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,060
So I think that's kind of neat.

1446
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,700
F zero G X.

1447
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:30,660
Hell yeah.

1448
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:34,340
One of my all time favorites, uh, underrated, uh, in the more

1449
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,420
recent department horizon, zero dawn.

1450
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,020
Uh, well, I guess that game's a few years old at this point, but still it's

1451
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,300
kinda, uh, dark Tetsuya, where you at?

1452
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,140
Cause they're doing the La Mulana remake.

1453
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,220
I know that's one of your faves out there.

1454
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,900
Uh, and for dark soccer, they're doing mass effect to, uh, speed run, and it's

1455
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,420
going to be done in an hour and 31 minutes.

1456
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,900
My God, that's going to be something else.

1457
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,300
Lots of mega man games.

1458
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,020
I don't know how I feel about speed runs of mass effect.

1459
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,780
Maybe I'll watch it.

1460
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,260
It's it's, it's a novelty.

1461
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,660
Let's just put it that, um, Pokemon games.

1462
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,140
Of course, there's going to be a black and white race.

1463
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,980
So that's going to be a, for that jet gen five, that would be so the gen five race.

1464
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,540
Uh, and then somebody is running Pokemon emerald.

1465
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,420
Uh, that'll be kind of fun to watch.

1466
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,260
Resident evil seven.

1467
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,740
Is getting speed runs, not eight yet.

1468
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,780
Eight's a little too new, but seven came out yet.

1469
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:26,220
Yeah.

1470
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:32,580
Uh, watch them words, Loki, you know, they're already working on it.

1471
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,500
Watch them words.

1472
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,620
It's it's absolutely being worked on already.

1473
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,340
And of course the old favorites, super Metroid is back.

1474
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:42,180
Uh, and there's a, you know, some Mario and, uh, I was trying to see

1475
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,300
if anything else jumped out at me.

1476
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,260
Oh, for me, Zoda's revenge star tropics too.

1477
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,820
We don't talk about the star tropics series on NES enough, quite honestly.

1478
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,940
Um, because people don't even remember there was a second game.

1479
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,540
So it's kind of cool.

1480
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,900
That was totally a classic game.

1481
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,460
It maybe I haven't done Zoda's revenge, but I brought it up when it did.

1482
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1483
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,140
You did the first one.

1484
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,180
You didn't do the second one yet, but the second one is interesting because,

1485
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,420
um, it was, uh, one of the, it was the next to last game on the NES.

1486
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,780
I believe warriors woods was last, but star tropics two is next to last.

1487
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,740
So it's interesting for that reason.

1488
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:19,020
Um, Bobby Blackwell says resident evil eight will be at awesome games done quick.

1489
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,660
Oh, Bobby pointing out something I missed.

1490
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,580
There are no final fantasy games.

1491
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:23,940
That's interesting.

1492
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,100
Well, I guess let's take a long time.

1493
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,620
They know it and they always do them.

1494
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,020
And that's, I think it's okay to put something on the back

1495
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,900
burner for a little bit.

1496
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,220
You know, jazz punk will be fun.

1497
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,060
I like that game.

1498
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:36,420
Yeah.

1499
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,700
Um, uh, what else do they have?

1500
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,220
That looks pretty awesome in here.

1501
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:44,220
Uh, I don't know.

1502
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:44,540
Jeez.

1503
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,060
There's like so many mega mans questbusters.

1504
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,540
So they must be having a race for that.

1505
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,860
So following up your resident evil eight comment quest buster is commenting in

1506
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,540
chat, uh, Bowser's fury already made the list.

1507
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,740
And that hasn't been out that long, all things considered.

1508
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,260
So it's February though.

1509
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,140
I mean, that's, I mean, that's still, yeah.

1510
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,300
Yeah.

1511
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:03,740
All right.

1512
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:06,860
Anyway, so go check out the list, uh, at games done quick.com.

1513
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,980
Uh, check that out.

1514
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,260
And, uh, I'm sure everybody will be watching the event later on this summer.

1515
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,420
So, all right.

1516
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,820
Uh, let's move on a dark Sakura with some more, uh, studio acquisition news.

1517
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,300
Indeed.

1518
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,580
And this, it has a little bit of significance on this one.

1519
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:27,980
So EA has bought, uh, a, uh, video game developer, uh, metal, metalhead

1520
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:28,580
software.

1521
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:35,620
There's a creator of a game called super mega baseball and EA, of course, you know,

1522
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,380
since they bought them, that means that they've got a new baseball franchise

1523
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,420
under their belt now.

1524
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:47,460
And so, um, cause I mean, it's been over, over 10 years since their last, uh,

1525
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,420
baseball SIM.

1526
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:51,660
That was MVP 07 NCAA baseball.

1527
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:59,340
So it looks like that this metalhead developed game, uh, is going to be

1528
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,620
coming out as an EA title.

1529
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:08,500
Um, they are in, uh, uh, Victoria and their office is still going to be open

1530
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,300
and functional.

1531
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:16,660
Um, but metalhead it's IPs are going to be owned by EA.

1532
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,820
So there you go.

1533
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,420
All right.

1534
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,980
EA is grabbing them up.

1535
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,500
So this means that they're looking back in the baseball genre.

1536
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,860
So it'd be interesting.

1537
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:27,620
All right.

1538
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,300
Uh, let's move on Loki.

1539
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:30,820
Yeah.

1540
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:35,940
So there's a, we talked about this once every few weeks or so about the new,

1541
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:40,500
um, enhancements being done to some of these older games on Xbox with the FPS

1542
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,940
boosting, where they're like doubling the FPS on certain games and whatnot.

1543
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,100
I was trying to get the full list.

1544
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:49,580
They added another 70 games, um, to it now.

1545
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,100
So it's ridiculous.

1546
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:55,780
Um, Right now, some of them wants to note, you know, they have Assassin's

1547
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,820
Creed, the Ezio collection, dying light, far cry, new Dawn, Lego worlds.

1548
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,220
Um, those are all now at 60 FPS.

1549
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,540
Uh, Metro last light at 120 FPS.

1550
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,940
Um, Metro is a great game.

1551
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:08,580
Seriously.

1552
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:13,220
It is important to know some of these you have to enable, like it's not just because

1553
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,220
I believe sometimes the frame boost effects quality.

1554
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:19,300
So for that reason, you have to enable it if you want it.

1555
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,100
So, um, there's a lot of guides out there from Microsoft on how to

1556
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,860
do this within your Xbox console.

1557
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,940
So something you should be aware of.

1558
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,900
I believe if the game supports this, it has an icon that says so at this point.

1559
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:29,420
Yes.

1560
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:36,060
And the, the most important game, getting a 120 FPS mode, untitled goose game,

1561
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,020
because I need that game to run at 120 FPS.

1562
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:45,980
Think of how fast I can honk now in that game with 120 FPS, you know, let's honk

1563
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:49,740
on every single frame and, uh, and we'll do that.

1564
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:54,820
So, uh, yeah, lots and lots of games that are backwards compatible,

1565
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,020
uh, with that, the FPS boosts.

1566
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:01,900
I mean, we can't go over all of them, but there there's a lot.

1567
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:06,140
So, um, I was trying to see if there's any other notable ones on here.

1568
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,500
I can't tell what was already on that list that they added now, but it's a lot.

1569
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,180
There's a full list on xbox.com.

1570
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,380
If you're curious, I'm also sure it's probably listed in games pass.

1571
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,020
You know, what's on there, but look for the icons.

1572
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,660
I mean, there's a ton of games and they're only, they're going to keep adding to it.

1573
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,660
So this is kind of what they're doing instead of backwards compatibility now.

1574
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,380
Well, I shouldn't say instead they claim they're still working on

1575
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,980
backwards compatibility, but I, I what's left besides the DDR games.

1576
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,700
I can't, I can't think of anything, but I'm sure there's some, but, uh, yeah.

1577
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:38,500
All right.

1578
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,180
Have they beaten groovy yet?

1579
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,220
Yes.

1580
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,700
You weren't expecting that answer.

1581
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,060
Were you?

1582
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,060
But yes, that is compatible.

1583
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,860
I don't think that one is, uh, neither is, uh, the rock band.

1584
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:56,580
Uh, I rock band blitz, but that's probably a music licensing thing.

1585
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,380
I'm going to play there.

1586
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,140
Who knows?

1587
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:02,060
Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says we need a DJ hero remake.

1588
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:02,580
Honestly.

1589
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,180
Yes.

1590
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:07,180
Oh God, I would be there day one immediately.

1591
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:07,860
Yeah.

1592
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,500
Um, but absolutely by that, I don't know if it's going to happen.

1593
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:16,420
Cause that guitar hero reboot, as good as it was, didn't do unfortunate news.

1594
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:19,540
As we talked about last week, there can't be a DJ hero game.

1595
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,820
Cause all of the games now are being, are all the game companies now at

1596
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,180
Activision are working on call of duty.

1597
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,100
So it's all called duty from now on.

1598
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,380
That's all that they're putting out.

1599
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:29,700
Womp womp.

1600
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:30,980
All right.

1601
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,340
Well, blizzard's putting some stuff out and, uh, of course the classics

1602
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,380
that they're putting out are, uh, you know, there's a, there's a lot of,

1603
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,660
they've been kind of dipping into the vault while they've been working on

1604
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,340
some new games, uh, we know Diablo two remastered is coming later this year,

1605
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,660
but coming a lot sooner on June 1st, the launch of world of Warcraft

1606
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,620
classic, the burning crusade.

1607
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,820
Um, so this is something that was teased several months ago, uh, that

1608
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,900
blizzard's going to be doing this.

1609
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,940
I think they've done some testing on it as well, but, uh, the burning

1610
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,980
crusade will be launching on June 1st.

1611
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,220
Uh, this is kind of a big deal for me because this was the expansion

1612
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,540
that really got me into wow.

1613
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,860
I did play in vanilla, but I didn't play a lot in vanilla.

1614
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,780
I subscribed for maybe like two months in vanilla.

1615
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,140
I started doing the rating and shit in the burning crusade.

1616
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,620
That's when I really got into wow.

1617
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,420
So I think this is really interesting.

1618
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:21,460
I'm, I'm not sure I have the drive to pay the monthly fee to do it again,

1619
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:28,020
but I'm also not going to say I'm not going to do it, so we'll see.

1620
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,340
Uh, and remember you pay, so you're ba you basically play a wow fee.

1621
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,900
And then with that monthly fee, you get to pick, do you want to play modern

1622
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,180
wow, or do you want to play classic?

1623
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:37,460
Wow.

1624
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:41,180
Now you might be wondering, well, aren't there going to be people that are going

1625
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:45,140
to be pissed off because what happens to vanilla wow, here's the kind of neat,

1626
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,860
interesting thing they're going to coexist.

1627
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,300
You're going to have wow.

1628
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,260
Classic classic vanilla.

1629
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,620
Wow.

1630
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,620
And burning crusade that coexist.

1631
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:57,620
So what's going to be happening in the next couple of weeks,

1632
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,900
you get to make a decision.

1633
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,660
You decide, do you want to move your character ahead to burning crusade?

1634
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,300
Or do you want to clone your character so you can keep playing,

1635
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,740
but why wouldn't you just clone?

1636
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,660
Maybe a, it might be character space limitations actually.

1637
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,020
Now that I'm thinking this out loud.

1638
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:17,020
So most people I imagine will probably just clone.

1639
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:20,340
I don't know why you wouldn't do that, but there might be some people that don't.

1640
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,980
Now for me, I don't even want to bring my character over.

1641
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,020
I would want to start a draenei or a blood elf, uh, and, and play the game

1642
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,620
from that perspective all over again.

1643
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,580
In fact, the draenei starting area is so pretty in my head.

1644
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,980
I'm making my draenei shaman.

1645
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:34,780
This is dangerous.

1646
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,620
This is, this is dangerous.

1647
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:42,660
Um, but anyway, uh, yeah, so may 18th is when that is all being implemented and

1648
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:46,140
you get to make your choice and while classic while classic also coming, coming

1649
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,740
under a little bit of heat because they're starting to do some store and micro

1650
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,340
transaction stuff with it, with some of the rare mounts and mounts you can't get

1651
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:58,340
anymore, but of course people are like, there wasn't a micro transaction store in

1652
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:58,820
classic.

1653
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:59,340
Wow.

1654
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,460
Well, classic.

1655
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:01,700
Wow.

1656
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,900
Didn't support widescreen either, but here we are.

1657
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:07,420
So, you know, it's a different times I suppose.

1658
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,100
So, so some things, some things are not going to be a classic.

1659
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:11,820
Yeah.

1660
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,900
Unfortunately though, this is, this is classic Activision, not classic.

1661
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:15,220
Wow.

1662
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,180
That we're dealing with here.

1663
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,740
So there will be a micro transaction store.

1664
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,300
Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob.

1665
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:25,260
So are we eventually going to have separate instances of the game at every

1666
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,380
expansion point?

1667
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,740
In my opinion, there they'll absolutely do this again for wrath of the Lich King.

1668
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,820
Absolutely.

1669
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:34,740
That is going to happen.

1670
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,620
That is what most people consider to be the pinnacle of wow was the wrath of the

1671
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,660
Lich King, in my opinion, that's it.

1672
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,940
They don't go beyond wrath of the Lich King.

1673
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:48,780
Um, the, the expansions after that, weren't quite as well received.

1674
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:54,020
Um, and I just don't, and I think that the viewpoint is going to be, if you want to

1675
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:54,460
play Mr.

1676
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,900
Pandaria, if you want to play, you know, Legion or something, then play modern.

1677
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,220
Wow.

1678
01:22:59,220 --> 01:22:59,740
It's there.

1679
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,500
It's still there.

1680
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:05,420
Um, and I don't think they've really changed Pandaria.

1681
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,220
Cause that would be the expansion after wrath of the Lich King in modern.

1682
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:10,660
Wow.

1683
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:15,460
I think they've done little changes to Outland and they've done changes to even

1684
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:19,460
Northrend and they certainly changed vanilla.

1685
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:19,860
Wow.

1686
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,580
No cat.

1687
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:21,460
Oh no.

1688
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,060
Cataclysm was after, um, wrath of the Lich King.

1689
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,660
That's why they have to stop because cataclysm completely changed.

1690
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,700
Um, am I mixing them up in my head?

1691
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:35,060
Huh?

1692
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,820
I can't even remember what order these expansions were in anymore.

1693
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,380
It was no cataclysm was out.

1694
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:40,220
Not, not Pandaria.

1695
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,020
Cataclysm was after before the pandas.

1696
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:43,380
Okay.

1697
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,180
Okay.

1698
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:49,140
So then my point is, but cataclysm completely changed vanilla.

1699
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:49,580
Wow.

1700
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,940
So they have to stop there because then vanilla wow is done.

1701
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,820
Um, although of course, could they have all these servers that are frozen in time?

1702
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:01,700
They could, I just, a cataclysm was not as well received as the others.

1703
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:06,140
Um, I would be very surprised if they go past wrath of the Lich King, but if they

1704
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,700
have enough people playing it, then they might.

1705
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:08,900
So I don't know.

1706
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:10,460
All right.

1707
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:14,740
Uh, bonds, double six, questioning my choice of going Draenei saying, I don't

1708
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,060
know, Rob, I'm for the horde.

1709
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:20,660
Uh, and bonds double six says the Lich King, just a big man, baby who

1710
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,020
wanted more than he deserved.

1711
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,980
Well, you know, some, some epic, epic grades and stuff though.

1712
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:27,300
I mean, there's going to be people that would absolutely want to

1713
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,940
run ice crown citadel again.

1714
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,620
I don't know why, but they will for sure.

1715
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:32,660
All right.

1716
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:37,380
Well, since we're talking about classics, Let's talk about a classic classic.

1717
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:40,660
It's that part of the show where dark soccer is going to step into the gaming

1718
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,260
vault and find a game that she thinks.

1719
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:46,660
Hey, forget signing up to pay your monthly fee so you can play classic.

1720
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:46,900
Wow.

1721
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:51,940
All over again, you find this, find a cartridge of this and suffer

1722
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,340
because this game was fucking hard.

1723
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,460
I got to, I got to tell you Alan's comment on this pick a little later.

1724
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,260
Cause he saw me pulling the B roll down tonight and he's like,

1725
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,540
Oh, I got stories about this.

1726
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,460
Um, but let's get to it.

1727
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,180
Dark soccer.

1728
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,900
You like to step into gaming vault, find a game that kids should be playing.

1729
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,820
What is the classic game of the week?

1730
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:13,780
It is the Simpsons, Bart versus the space mutants.

1731
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:15,980
There it is.

1732
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,900
And so this game is not the best of all games.

1733
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:27,540
I will say that sometimes I'd pull out a stinker, but it is notable for being

1734
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:34,940
one of the best known games based off of the Simpsons, one of the very early ones.

1735
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:39,140
Um, it, uh, it came out in 1991 for the NES.

1736
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:45,420
It also came out for the Amiga, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64,

1737
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:50,300
uh, and the ZX Spectrum, and then in 92 for the Sega Genesis,

1738
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,060
master system and Game Gear.

1739
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:58,380
Um, it was published by Acclaim, RIP, and Ocean Software, uh, for the

1740
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,580
computers and was developed by, um, Imagineering and Arc Developments.

1741
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:09,380
So basically with this one, um, you start off as playing Bart.

1742
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,940
Oh, for the record, the Amiga and MS-DOS versions had a different

1743
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:17,460
animated intro that was basically like a digitized clip from the show.

1744
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,020
Anyway, um, it is a 2D side scrolling platformer.

1745
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,820
You play in a single player game.

1746
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:28,900
You play as Bart, um, and he is the only one who knows, uh, of the, uh,

1747
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:34,300
aliens, uh, plan because his X-ray specs allow him to see them kind of

1748
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,180
like they live, you know, obey.

1749
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:45,220
At any rate, um, he, uh, has to basically stop them from picking up certain items

1750
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,020
they need for an ultimate weapon.

1751
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:51,580
Um, and he goes through five levels, um, and he has to either collect or

1752
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:56,820
destroy certain objects, purple things in the first level, hats in the second,

1753
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,580
balloons in the third, exit signs in the fourth and nuclear rods in the fifth.

1754
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,420
If he loses a life, he says, eat my shorts.

1755
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:08,100
Um, and then of course the other objective is for Bart to convince

1756
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:12,540
his family about the aliens so that they'll help them in levels.

1757
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,260
So, um, you have different equipment, you have rockets and cherry bombs.

1758
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:23,380
Um, you can buy them with coins that you collect when the aliens are, are vanquished.

1759
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,900
Um, you have to jump on their heads to get rid of them.

1760
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:34,580
Um, and then in some time and the first level you can call Mo and prank him

1761
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:38,500
so that you get spray paint, you know, so all kinds of interesting stuff.

1762
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:46,380
Um, and, uh, it actually is, you know, one of the earliest games, uh, based

1763
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:51,780
on the Simpsons, uh, has the theme song from the show and it was designed

1764
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:58,660
by, uh, Gary kitchen who developed Keystone capers and pressure cooker for Activision.

1765
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:06,620
Um, and as far as the reviews that it got, it was a best seller.

1766
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:13,540
I mean, it sold pretty well, but critics have been, eh, critical?

1767
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:20,100
Um, some places said that the game was both difficult and boring.

1768
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:25,260
Um, Nintendo power gave it a 66 out of a hundred.

1769
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:32,060
And the quote is his adventure though, is anything but a game for underachievers.

1770
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:35,700
It is very challenging and could be frustratingly so to some players.

1771
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:47,300
Um, but you know, it's one of those games, however, that sticks out in, I would say

1772
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,860
in the mental history of people who lived through that era, who know

1773
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,820
when it, who knew when it came out and yeah, I played it and yeah, it's hard.

1774
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:03,220
I kind of didn't care for it myself, but it is, I would put it in the area

1775
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,740
of being fairly notable, wouldn't you say?

1776
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,700
I would say, yeah.

1777
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,700
Um, did you ever play it?

1778
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:15,980
I did play it.

1779
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:19,180
Um, I think I may have had to use the Game Genie with it,

1780
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,820
but I did quite a bit.

1781
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,900
I played all of the Simpsons games actually on both the

1782
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,380
Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

1783
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,700
So, um, most definitely played this.

1784
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:32,780
I remember it being extremely hard and I don't know, just kind of weird.

1785
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,740
Yeah, it was, it was weird.

1786
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,260
I was just gonna say, I did not play it.

1787
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,700
Um, I, I did not get into the Simpsons games until Bart's

1788
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,380
Nightmare on the Super Nintendo, which I'd played a little bit of that.

1789
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,540
Um, which also was funky.

1790
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:45,500
What's that?

1791
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,540
I said that one was definitely a better game.

1792
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:51,260
Not by much, but yes, better because of the platform it was on.

1793
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,380
But I will say, so Alan saw me grabbing the B-roll for this tonight

1794
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,820
and he's like, Oh, this game.

1795
01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:00,020
But he played it and he said he'd beat it, which I was pretty impressed

1796
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:03,020
by because I know this game was notorious for its difficulty for one.

1797
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,220
But he also pointed out that, um, it had really good homages to the show.

1798
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,740
Like, especially when you consider it's on the NES, you know, it was

1799
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,740
where most people know it from.

1800
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:12,940
Yes.

1801
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,740
I know there's Amiga and that stuff too, but most people know the NES version.

1802
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:19,180
Like, you know, the fact that it has, you know, a pretty, pretty, uh,

1803
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,700
true to form crank call in it.

1804
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:25,180
All the characters and references from the early seasons of the

1805
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,500
Simpsons, which I don't know about you guys, but those are the only ones.

1806
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,100
I remember.

1807
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,180
I can't, I can't tell you anything.

1808
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,780
The Simpsons has done in the last 20 years.

1809
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,500
It blows my mind.

1810
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,900
The show is still on quite frankly.

1811
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,180
Um, it has been fairly prophetic though.

1812
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,780
Yeah, it's uh, yeah, that's true.

1813
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,180
That's true.

1814
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:39,380
Yeah.

1815
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:41,740
Cause didn't it, didn't predict that like Trump would be president

1816
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,340
like years and years before.

1817
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,340
There's, that's not it.

1818
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,100
There's like a lot of other stuff too.

1819
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,620
So yeah.

1820
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:52,380
Um, but I think also, you know, as much as this game was not like

1821
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,900
super well received critically.

1822
01:30:55,300 --> 01:31:00,740
I think this really speaks to the power of the licensed games back in the day.

1823
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:04,540
And I think there's a big difference between back in the day licensed games.

1824
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:08,580
And now, like now I think it's kind of like a running gag that things that are

1825
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:10,740
based on movies and stuff usually stink.

1826
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:14,260
But back in the day, like a license would really sell a game.

1827
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,860
Fucking look at ET on the Atari.

1828
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:21,220
You know, that was, they, they, they, they wrote everything on that game.

1829
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:25,140
And even though ET is not solely responsible for the, the video game

1830
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:29,140
crash, even though many people like faulted for that, um, it was definitely

1831
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:34,020
a reason, um, and I think just, you know, spoke to the power of like what licenses

1832
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:39,540
can do for selling games based on name alone, quite frankly, especially in the

1833
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:43,900
example of ET and I think why this is a worthy classic game of the week, dark

1834
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:48,660
Sakura, because there isn't a lot of stuff like it on the NES there's other

1835
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:52,420
licensed stuff, you know, but I, the Simpsons one in particular, the way it

1836
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:57,820
sold so well, I think is all because of, you know, the fact that it's, it's a

1837
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:58,540
Simpsons game.

1838
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:02,060
And because it's a video game on the NES, it looked a little more like the cartoon.

1839
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:08,660
Yeah, it was pretty good for a NES game, you know, as far as graphically.

1840
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:09,440
Yeah.

1841
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:12,340
And I also, I did not know I learned this for the first time tonight.

1842
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,180
Thanks to dark Sakura.

1843
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,580
I had no idea the guy behind Keystone capers did this.

1844
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:19,220
I loved as far as like, as far as Atari classics go, I think that

1845
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,660
one is extremely underrated.

1846
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:21,940
I may have even done that.

1847
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:22,940
I'd have to check the Wiki.

1848
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,740
I may have done that as a classic game on one of the weeks that you weren't

1849
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:29,340
here, dark Sakura, because I think it's, it's that good of a game.

1850
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,820
That's why I brought it up.

1851
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,500
Oh, okay.

1852
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,500
Well, there you go.

1853
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,660
That was a long time ago though.

1854
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:35,980
If I did, I don't remember talking about it.

1855
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,140
It was probably a while ago, but yeah.

1856
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,620
Um, that's the, that's the game.

1857
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:41,380
All right.

1858
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:41,940
There it is.

1859
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,180
Bart versus the space moons.

1860
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:46,060
Um, before I take us back here, I do want to point out, um, in chat

1861
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,260
quest buster is saying a claim was huge on licensed games.

1862
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,660
They also made a lot of bad games.

1863
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,140
That's right.

1864
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:54,300
They, they made some good stuff and they made some bad stuff.

1865
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,460
Weren't they also, um, wizards and warriors.

1866
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,380
Wasn't that a claim?

1867
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,620
No, that was, or was that rare?

1868
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:02,660
That was rare.

1869
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,420
I think it, no, I don't think it was rare.

1870
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:04,700
Hold on.

1871
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,380
I'll double check.

1872
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:06,020
Okay.

1873
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,420
Um, let's see.

1874
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,980
And then, uh, the, the many folks in chat claim, it is a claim.

1875
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,220
Okay.

1876
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,620
And then many folks in chat talking about, um, arcade Simpsons being

1877
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:17,300
the one that people really remember.

1878
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,060
Yes, absolutely.

1879
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:22,100
But for whatever reason, and probably just due to the licensing issues and

1880
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:27,020
stuff, the, the arcade version of the Simpsons never existed on the NES.

1881
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:27,500
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1882
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,140
They finally got the Ninja turtles game on it.

1883
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,860
I don't think they ever did the arcade Simpsons on the NES.

1884
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:35,820
I don't think it was till there may have been PC version, I think,

1885
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,260
uh, or a computer version.

1886
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,700
But, um, yeah, that's the one that certainly a lot of people remember.

1887
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:41,380
Okay.

1888
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,460
So DJ Rama asks, uh, on the wizards and warriors, it was both rare developed

1889
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,620
it, a claim published it, so it was both names on that.

1890
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,780
That's why my brain was hurting.

1891
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:51,620
Okay.

1892
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:52,580
Awesome.

1893
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,620
Uh, orange, right.

1894
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,260
Says it was only ported to dos.

1895
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:56,420
Yeah.

1896
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:57,700
I thought I remember playing this one.

1897
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,740
He also thinks maybe Commodore 64, which surprises me, but also doesn't

1898
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:05,900
because the Commodore 64 was still a huge platform into the early

1899
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,300
nineties and other countries.

1900
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,780
So interesting.

1901
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:09,540
All right.

1902
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,180
Anyway, uh, a lot to say on that one.

1903
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:12,380
Huh?

1904
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,580
Great pick dark Sakura.

1905
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:16,060
I mean, yeah, it's not, it's not something that's remembered for being

1906
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:21,860
great, but I think it is remembered for being, um, Important, I guess, you

1907
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:25,740
know, not just in it's, it's a urban legend of how fucking hard it is, but

1908
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:30,060
just a licensed game that really kind of sold a lot on the NES.

1909
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:36,180
So, all right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some

1910
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,540
other things going on in the industry kind of quickly here.

1911
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:39,740
So Loki, we'll start with you.

1912
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:40,740
Yeah.

1913
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,700
I came, I need to go back and play as a Yakuza, like a dragon.

1914
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:48,860
And it's kind of cool to see that there, uh, the studio behind it is

1915
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:53,900
actually talking about some future releases in the, uh, Yakuza series.

1916
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:59,060
And they're saying that they're going to be following the same game style

1917
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,900
with turn-based RPG combat instead of just the standard brawler.

1918
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,260
So, uh, I'm all about that.

1919
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,340
I can't wait to check out the new game.

1920
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:10,940
Um, so coming soon, I guess at some point.

1921
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:19,100
And then, um, for PlayStation plus in may, we've got a few games that are going to

1922
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,140
be available, uh, with your subscriptions.

1923
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:27,220
So looks like a rec fest on PlayStation five stranded deep on PlayStation four

1924
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:30,060
and battlefield five on PlayStation four.

1925
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,260
And those are available until June 1st.

1926
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,580
Um, cool.

1927
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:36,780
All right.

1928
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,860
And, um, Bobby and chat mentioning that judgment is the brawler line.

1929
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:43,180
And yeah, I caught that about that split with Yakuza.

1930
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:48,500
Does that speak to the Yakuza, like a dragon performed pretty darn well.

1931
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,180
And so they want to make more games like that, but that might have helped

1932
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:56,700
that it was one of the only truly, um, next gen titles available when

1933
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,580
series X launched, I think, uh, probably help.

1934
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:02,660
I still need to play it, um, at some point, but I, you know, I know Bobby

1935
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,980
played through the whole thing and really enjoyed it and he's not the

1936
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,380
only one I've heard kind of mentioned that.

1937
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:09,140
So that's interesting that the, the series is kind of pivoting like that,

1938
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,860
but at the same time, you know, you know, there'd be people that would be

1939
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:15,660
pissed if the main Yakuza series, you know, completely took that over and,

1940
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,460
and adopt that format.

1941
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,140
So it's nice that the judgment series kind of also exists for

1942
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:22,460
fans of, uh, you know, classic Yakuza as it were at this point.

1943
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,300
So, yeah.

1944
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,060
All right.

1945
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:28,940
Um, Questbuster says, as someone that has played every game in the Yakuza

1946
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:33,500
series, except for the Japan only releases like Isshin, uh, I'm okay with

1947
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,100
this change.

1948
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:37,140
I think, I think most people are because both games still exist.

1949
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,460
They just have different titles.

1950
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,460
It's not the end of the world.

1951
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,580
You can buy, you can buy both.

1952
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,180
You can buy neither.

1953
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:41,980
You can buy one or the other.

1954
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,020
All right.

1955
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,100
Uh, Dar Sakura, please.

1956
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:52,260
So, uh, Shirley, who is, uh, Shirley Curry, who is the, uh, uh, Skyrim playing

1957
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:59,540
grandma, um, she actually now has her own mod and she's provided her voice for it.

1958
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:06,100
Um, so it's, uh, basically called Shirley, a Skyrim, uh, mod.

1959
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,620
She, uh, it's up on Nexus.

1960
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:14,420
She's in there as a, uh, she'll give you some stories of her adventures and has a

1961
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:17,340
little house and some unique items and a quest to complete.

1962
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,820
She has been immortalized in the game she loves.

1963
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:21,940
That's awesome.

1964
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,260
Thank you.

1965
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:22,740
Modders.

1966
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,100
Also, you can't marry her.

1967
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:31,420
Well, wait, wait, until, until the modders mod the mod.

1968
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,780
I think, I think it was one of the things she decided.

1969
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,260
They will, they will do it.

1970
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:42,260
Can the modders mod the mod and make grandma's neighbor mod.

1971
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,260
Starring Bea Arthur.

1972
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:45,460
Yes.

1973
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,820
So, and next story.

1974
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,300
And then there's mod.

1975
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,020
All right, go ahead.

1976
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:50,780
Okay.

1977
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,540
Nobody under 40 is going to understand what I just did.

1978
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,300
All right, go ahead.

1979
01:37:55,220 --> 01:38:01,220
Avex, which we know Avex, uh, tracks great, you know, music producer is going

1980
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:06,460
to be bringing back cyber trance series, but a little bit more modern.

1981
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:11,980
Um, it was, is definitely one of those, uh, compilations that I really

1982
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:17,900
enjoyed, uh, you know, in the, the early aughts and I think it's going to be great.

1983
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:22,940
They've also brought out a cybertrance, the fifth cybertrance YouTube channel.

1984
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:31,260
And, um, they, uh, are bringing back also the Velfar cybertrance series is

1985
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,100
going to be available for streaming.

1986
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,460
So that's really awesome.

1987
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,820
And they're going to take all that money.

1988
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,220
I I'm excited for this too.

1989
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:43,020
Jason even references in the intro that he's, you know, shout out to Jason, who

1990
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,940
does all our voiceovers here, if you didn't know, um, he, uh, uh, was talking

1991
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,820
about that in the intro and I'm like, yep, pretty much the same, you know, I'm,

1992
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,780
I'm looking forward to this too.

1993
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,700
I didn't know they already had stuff posted on YouTube.

1994
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:56,100
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, uh, the song on their YouTube was pretty sick.

1995
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,740
So I'm going to need to check that out.

1996
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:03,100
I just hope, unlike last time, I hope this time they put it up on streaming

1997
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:08,220
services so that we're not just having to trade like burn CDs, um, which I know

1998
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:11,860
you're not really sure check Apple music real quick, which please do.

1999
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,500
Cause if it's there, it's going to be everywhere.

2000
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:19,300
Um, uh, but, um, now in the days, you know, the nice thing is the streaming

2001
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,100
services, you're seeing more of the international stuff, especially when it

2002
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:25,060
comes to video game stuff, uh, is going on those services.

2003
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,460
So that's pretty cool.

2004
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,420
Um, sadly, what's still not on streaming services.

2005
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:34,460
Cause I was just thinking about this the other day is that the dance maniacs

2006
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:39,300
series that a lot of the DDR originals came from still not on, so there are

2007
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:45,300
some cybertrance stuff up on there, but I don't see anything really recent.

2008
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:49,420
There's, uh, the, uh, uh, Hamasaki Ayumi stuff.

2009
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,820
There's cybertrance presents iutrance too.

2010
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:57,900
So it's some of the, um, older stuff is up there, but the stuff is there.

2011
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:03,980
I remember what put me down that road because I realized Spotify released a

2012
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:09,260
lot of back catalog erotic, the band that was in DDR, you know, do it all night.

2013
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,980
Do we have all that stuff?

2014
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:14,500
So their back catalog, like all their CDs are available on Spotify now.

2015
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,260
And I imagine if it's there, it's Apple music and you know, all the places you

2016
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:23,500
listen to music, um, and, uh, the, including their ABBA album, which I'm

2017
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,420
gonna tell you the cover of angel eyes that erotic does, which is a very

2018
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,540
underrated ABBA song.

2019
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:31,580
Number one, number two, erotic does a killer job of that song.

2020
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:37,100
So that made me think, where's that dance mania erotic nonstop mega mix.

2021
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,340
Remember that album?

2022
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:39,540
That album was great.

2023
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,060
That's where cat's eye came from.

2024
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,660
And then they had a bonus track.

2025
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,620
That's probably one of the best songs they've ever had called in in Moncure.

2026
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,740
And they covered cat's eye.

2027
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,060
Yeah, that was a cover.

2028
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:48,460
That's right.

2029
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:51,900
Cat's eye was a cover, but the actual mix and DDR was on that mega mix CD.

2030
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:56,420
Um, so anyway, this is, this is, this is super nerdy DDR stuff from back

2031
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,660
of the day when we were, this is what we would talk about nonstop was this stuff.

2032
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:04,380
Um, I wanted that album so bad, but that is not on streaming services.

2033
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,740
And that made me go down a rabbit hole of dance mania stuff.

2034
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:12,340
A lot of it's on YouTube though, somehow, um, without, uh, getting

2035
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:16,740
copyright strikes, but I thought that was interesting anyway.

2036
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,340
Sorry.

2037
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,580
I know that's supposed to be rapid, but it was a throwback.

2038
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:25,940
You, you tackled it ish rapid, rapid dash, rapid throw up, wait.

2039
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,660
No, in that rapid throw up.

2040
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:29,340
All right.

2041
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,060
Let's travel.

2042
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,540
Sorry, I've been playing a little bit too much of the plague.

2043
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:34,060
All right.

2044
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,700
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and things

2045
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,420
we'll probably getting be getting a little sooner than the erotic mega mix

2046
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,580
from dance mania on Spotify and Apple music.

2047
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:43,180
Yeah.

2048
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:43,420
Yeah.

2049
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:44,500
We ain't getting that this week.

2050
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,140
I'm sorry.

2051
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:52,300
Um, this week we're getting hood outlaws and legends on PC, PlayStation four,

2052
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:57,300

The girl who stands behind, uh, both on Nintendo switch mass effect,

2058
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:23,420

2059
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,020
That's it.

2060
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,220
All right.

2061
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,660
Let's travel over to Japan.

2062
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,020
Golden week is over.

2063
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,900
So now we're back to release dates in Japan.

2064
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:33,940
Um, and, uh, we have a couple of things this week that sub Nautica and sub Nautica

2065
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:38,060
below zero pack on switch that is also out this week in Japan, uh, also the

2066
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:42,420
Famicom detective club, the missing air and the girl who stands behind, uh, has

2067
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,900
a collector's edition coming out this week.

2068
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,660
Um, I believe those are coming out in the U S as well.

2069
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:50,980
Uh, and, um, I know some folks are looking forward to that, but those,

2070
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,140
the Japan's getting it too.

2071
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,340
Uh, so those are out on may 14th and that's, what's on the switch.

2072
01:42:55,580 --> 01:43:00,660
Uh, PlayStation five actually gets sub Nautica below zero as well in Japan this

2073
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:00,940
week.

2074
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,300
So you have that to look forward to.

2075
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:06,540
And then on the PlayStation four, um, we have the sub Nautica below

2076
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,220
zero and that's about it.

2077
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:13,260
Um, uh, Oh, Moto GP 21 is also out this week on PlayStation four.

2078
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:16,460
Um, not the mass effect legendary edition in Japan.

2079
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:20,140
I imagine they'll have to wait a little bit to get a localized version of that.

2080
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:21,860
Uh, how about the UK?

2081
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:22,380
Darc, Sakura?

2082
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,860
Oh, only a handful.

2083
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,940
We have all on the 14th.

2084
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,220
We have Brigadine.

2085
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:32,340
We have sub Nautica below zero and mass effect, legendary edition.

2086
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:34,580
All right.

2087
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,740
Well, with mass effect, what else do you need?

2088
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:38,700
All right.

2089
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:40,220
We have, did you say what else?

2090
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,460
Because those don't exist.

2091
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:46,260
All right, let's move on.

2092
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,860
Uh, we have a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to

2093
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:51,020
get to the listener round table.

2094
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,980
I'm putting a new twist on it tonight.

2095
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,780
I haven't even told my co-host, but it'll be a good one.

2096
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,900
We're putting a new twist on the listener round table tonight.

2097
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,980
So I'll talk to more about that in a minute.

2098
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:01,460
What a twist.

2099
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:02,180
What a twist.

2100
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:05,100
I know I'm M Night Shyamalan-ing this right now, so let's do it.

2101
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:06,300
All right.

2102
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,540
Loki, what's next?

2103
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:12,700
So there's apparently a class action lawsuit against Sony

2104
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:14,300
over the PlayStation store.

2105
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:19,460
They call it a price monopoly being that, Hey, it is on the PlayStation

2106
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,180
and there's only one storefront that you can purchase games on the PlayStation.

2107
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:28,340
As such games are probably more expensive on there than you would

2108
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:31,540
find at retail in a competitive market.

2109
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,620
They're alleging.

2110
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,820
Nobody tell these guys about the eShop.

2111
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:36,340
Okay.

2112
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,740
Nintendo actually, you know, I take that back.

2113
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:41,260
Nintendo is just ridiculous prices all the time.

2114
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:45,580
Um, and that's both physical and, uh, digital, but can't you buy

2115
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,940
Nintendo stuff on Humble Bundle?

2116
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:52,380
You can, but it's not like what I'm complaining about is that they've

2117
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:56,780
got, you know, their gains are always $60 and they never discount them eventually.

2118
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:00,100
Um, it's very rare that you find that stuff discounted.

2119
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:05,780
Although I must say that I visited the local Target and they have a good stack

2120
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:08,780
of gaming watches marked down to $49.99.

2121
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:15,620
So, you know, maybe time, maybe soon time to pick one of those up.

2122
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,140
Let's wait till they get lower.

2123
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,460
$19.99.

2124
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:19,660
Yeah.

2125
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,020
Wait, wait for $19.99.

2126
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:21,660
Absolutely.

2127
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:23,860
All right.

2128
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:25,380
Yeah, that's what they're alleging so far.

2129
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:28,580
They didn't give any sort of examples of like, Hey, this game is this much here.

2130
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,700
And this much here.

2131
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,380
Um, it's right now, it's a complaint.

2132
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:36,700
I'm guessing probably just to take, you know, aim at Sony when Epic is taking

2133
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:38,820
aim at Apple and then granted if.

2134
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:43,180
However, the court, you know, rules with the whole Apple thing, you know, about

2135
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:46,940
having multiple storefronts available on, you know, kind of these, uh, closed

2136
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:50,940
marketplaces, we'll see how that affects some of these other storefronts.

2137
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,980
Somebody's trying to set the stage to have it trickle down to PlayStation.

2138
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:54,500
Basically.

2139
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:57,300
I think that's what they're trying, but I think it, it's going

2140
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,220
to be a hard sell right now.

2141
01:45:58,300 --> 01:45:58,660
It is.

2142
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,940
It's, it's going to be a bit of a gamble.

2143
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:00,500
That's for sure.

2144
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:01,300
Yeah.

2145
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,260
All right.

2146
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:04,780
Um, well, we're going to go to the next story.

2147
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,500
Um, unfortunately my computer froze.

2148
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,980
Can anyone assist me on the next story here?

2149
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,220
Um, sure.

2150
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,540
Um, Oh, go ahead.

2151
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:13,140
Do you want to do it?

2152
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:14,580
Uh, you can do it.

2153
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:15,100
Sorry.

2154
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:15,260
Okay.

2155
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:16,540
Live radio sucks.

2156
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:19,980
So as we were talking about, um, you know, and it just makes sense.

2157
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:24,100
Uh, games com 2021 is going to be an online only event after all.

2158
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,820
Originally they were talking about some sort of, you know, a hybrid

2159
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:31,300
event, but now it's just, let's just go digital.

2160
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:34,980
I mean, with the way the pandemic is, you know, better safe than sorry.

2161
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:39,340
So a lot of folks, you know, already different events going purely digital.

2162
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:42,100
So it makes sense that this year they're going to be doing the same.

2163
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,740
Um, it's still going to be happening.

2164
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,860
It looks like August 25th through the 27th.

2165
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:52,180
So we'll have to look forward to what they're going to announce during that time.

2166
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:54,420
Yay.

2167
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:55,500
Awesome.

2168
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:59,700
Well, well, and I have some interesting news as well.

2169
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,220
It is my turn, right?

2170
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,060
Yes, please.

2171
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:04,220
Okay.

2172
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:12,220
Um, we have our inductees to the 2021 world video game hall of fame.

2173
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:16,460
Got some interesting ones on here and none of them are surprising, except

2174
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,300
that they haven't already been there.

2175
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:26,260
So out of all of these, uh, finalists, we now have star craft.

2176
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,140
We have where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

2177
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:31,340
Of course.

2178
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:36,260
Microsoft flight simulator, which I think that one's been a bit overdue

2179
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:42,860
and drum roll, the very first animal crossing, which was out in Japan as

2180
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:53,340
double tsunami E plus the game P version finally, and it is a well-deserved.

2181
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:56,900
Well-deserved they're all really, really top-notch inductees.

2182
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,900
Is there some type of maybe like age requirement?

2183
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,500
I mean, I don't know if you know, but maybe there's an agent because, um, that

2184
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,180
game would be right about 20 years old.

2185
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,140
So it was like the rock and roll hall of fame.

2186
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,140
I think you have to have your first single or whatever, like 30, 20 years.

2187
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:11,500
I don't remember.

2188
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,020
So maybe there's something with that going on there.

2189
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:18,060
Just saying, has it be on our classic game of the week list?

2190
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:23,260
So, you know, anybody, they're just leeching on our shit.

2191
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:23,940
Yeah.

2192
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:27,740
We, we have, we have our own hall of fame.

2193
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:28,340
That's for sure.

2194
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:29,380
We do.

2195
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:30,460
All right.

2196
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:31,740
There's some sticky ones in there.

2197
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:34,540
Uh, let's move on Loki.

2198
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:37,500
So this is stupid.

2199
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:42,940
Um, I'm just going to say that now, but apparently there is a blizzard is blocking

2200
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:47,340
or has filed a notice of opposition with the patent and trademark office to block

2201
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:55,140
Fox, uh, as in the, the television network from trademarking Diablo as one of the

2202
01:48:55,140 --> 01:49:00,140
canine characters in the brand new, uh, series housebroken, which is about dogs.

2203
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:08,700
So, um, blizzard is stating that there may be, um, some confusion that says in the

2204
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:12,860
view of the fact that the marks at issue are identical and in consideration of

2205
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:17,340
other factors, such as a relationship between the imposter's goods and services

2206
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,020
as identified by market Diablo and applicants goods and their commercial

2207
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:24,500
strength, uh, it's likely members of the public will erroneously believe that

2208
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,100
applicants goods, basically they're saying they're going to be confused.

2209
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:32,180
I'm not going to be confused when I see, and as they say, the different things

2210
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:38,180
that they're going to be using this patent for a trademark for, um, Diablo

2211
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:42,980
pet bowls or pet treats, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to think that, Oh,

2212
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,780
blizzard's putting out pet treats.

2213
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:50,060
Blizzard has pet litter that they're marketing their game with.

2214
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,140
It's stupid.

2215
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,380
It is absolutely stupid.

2216
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:57,580
And I hope that they punish them for this because it's ridiculous.

2217
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:01,460
I'm not as likely to fall as hard on blizzard on this.

2218
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:05,340
Um, I think the issue is that Fox wants a trademark on Diablo.

2219
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:09,180
And so blizzard wants to protect their existing trademark.

2220
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:12,780
Uh, yes, it's a stretch, a lot of these things, but what about a

2221
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,020
t-shirt that says Diablo on it?

2222
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,420
What are they talking about?

2223
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,980
They're talking about the dog and they're talking about the game.

2224
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,180
Now, I guess a lot of that's going to depend on what's it look like.

2225
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:22,260
Yeah, exactly.

2226
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:29,700
Like, so like the name Diablo, I mean, there's, we have, we have a park in

2227
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:33,180
California for, well, there's a volcano or there used to be a walking Mount

2228
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:36,180
Diablo, um, are they going to Sue the mountain?

2229
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:40,180
I mean, no, no, because the mountain's not trying to trademark the name.

2230
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,060
But it doesn't matter though.

2231
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:46,820
Like if the, if the actual treatments are like completely different, I don't

2232
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,140
see the point what they're going to be.

2233
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,940
There's no confusion is what they're.

2234
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,660
I mean, they have to say that there's confusion because otherwise they don't

2235
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:56,540
have a case, but like it, there's no confusion here.

2236
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,460
I agree.

2237
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,340
It's a stretch.

2238
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:03,420
What I don't agree with is that I do think that blizzard is taking issue.

2239
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:05,900
I see how blizzard ended up in court with this.

2240
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:08,380
They're taking issue to the fact that someone else is trying to trademark

2241
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:13,220
Diablo, perhaps if they don't defend it, then they look like they're willing to

2242
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:16,260
give it up or whatever, especially when they've got a couple of games coming out

2243
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:19,220
on the way and there's going to be a lot of merchandise, although yes, of course, I

2244
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:23,020
believe that both yes, Diablo, the game is not going to have pet food.

2245
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:24,300
Like that would be ridiculous.

2246
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:28,860
Um, but I think when it comes down to the more generic stuff, like, you know, shirts

2247
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:32,740
and stuff, it's, it's really going to have to be about that look and I'm not sure.

2248
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,820
And this is part of why.

2249
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:39,580
These sorts of laws need to be, um, updated and stuff is that we know Diablo

2250
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:43,180
is Diablo when it's in a certain font and it's in red and, you know, looks all

2251
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:45,020
Satan-y for lack of a better term.

2252
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:45,340
Right.

2253
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,100
That's what we know Diablo.

2254
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,740
Whereas I don't think Diablo, the dog is going to look anything like that.

2255
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,980
So I don't know.

2256
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:55,980
Phoenix 77 26 is telling me this is a stretch Armstrong stretch.

2257
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:56,940
Very stretchy.

2258
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:02,380
Well, um, uh, see a Tiberian chat says, YouTuber Patrick star is allowed to use

2259
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:06,300
the name Patrick star unless he's pretending to be a cartoon starfish.

2260
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:07,780
That'd be annoying though.

2261
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:11,220
Like if your, your name was trademarked and like, sorry, you can't use that.

2262
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:15,900
It's like that happened with that one singer when, uh, the group lady and

2263
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,580
Antebellum tried to change their name.

2264
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,220
That's right.

2265
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:22,420
They, uh, lady a was supposed to be the new name and, uh, there was some artist

2266
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:25,060
in the Seattle area, I believe that already used that name.

2267
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:25,660
That's right.

2268
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:26,460
I remember that.

2269
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:26,980
Yeah.

2270
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:30,140
And they were trying to Sue the shit out of her for a name that's

2271
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:31,220
already been hers for years.

2272
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:31,740
Yeah.

2273
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:32,380
Yeah.

2274
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:36,140
So they, did they ever settle that or did they have to change her name again?

2275
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:37,380
I don't know.

2276
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:37,980
Yeah, I don't know.

2277
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:44,420
But I mean, the, the term Antebellum isn't, oh no, no.

2278
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:50,620
I just did association, but it's just means before the civil war.

2279
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:50,940
Yeah.

2280
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,900
I understand why they changed it.

2281
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:53,940
That's not, that's not the issue.

2282
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:56,940
I just, you know, did they, did they end up having to change it again?

2283
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:59,660
Cause they couldn't use lady a yeah.

2284
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,300
I don't know.

2285
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:05,260
So they soured anything I could ever have thought positively of them with this.

2286
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:10,420
Um, the chicks didn't end up in the same situation though, despite the fact their

2287
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:12,420
name is very vague, right?

2288
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:15,380
No, I think they actually, from day one, they gave credit.

2289
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:17,300
There was like an Australian group or something called that.

2290
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,540
And they kind of like gave credit to them right out the gate.

2291
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,460
And I think that's cooler.

2292
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,220
All right.

2293
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:24,580
Fair enough.

2294
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:29,980
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's a dude named Mike Rowe who has a software

2295
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:35,220
company called Mike Rose soft and Microsoft tried to Sue and lost.

2296
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:36,460
I never knew about that.

2297
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:40,500
That's, that's an interesting Mike Rose soft.

2298
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:47,100
Uh, that sounds like that's more of like, they're trying to make a pun and I, I, I

2299
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,980
could see it a little bit of problem there, but like, cause you don't just

2300
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,660
say, I don't know how, okay.

2301
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:58,020
I have to ask, how does Four Seasons Gardening Company get to exist?

2302
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:08,540
Because now the hotel can prove that there's confusion, maybe they just

2303
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:13,900
consider that that's like, well, most people would, idiots wouldn't think.

2304
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,460
What idiots going to confuse us with a gardening co.

2305
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:18,860
All right.

2306
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:20,500
Uh, let's move on.

2307
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:25,300
Our last story tonight, a follow-up, uh, to something we had talked about

2308
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:28,900
previously, um, which is the Humble Bundle.

2309
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:32,020
And, uh, remember how we talked about that, uh, they were getting rid of those

2310
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:32,700
sliders.

2311
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:35,900
You wouldn't be able to donate, uh, as much to charity anymore and all this.

2312
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,420
Well, well, how about this?

2313
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,540
Uh, they've rethought their position.

2314
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:44,780
I wonder why, I wonder if there was outrage on any internet platform, uh, that

2315
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,580
was looking like they, uh, were having to retreat on their position a little bit.

2316
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:50,740
Uh, yes.

2317
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:54,860
Uh, Humble wrote a blog post and said, we've heard everyone loud and clear and

2318
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:57,100
apologize for the way these changes were rolled out.

2319
01:54:57,340 --> 01:55:01,500
We are now taking a moment to pause, collect constructive feedback and be more

2320
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,460
transparent about the path forward.

2321
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:06,700
So long story short, the sliders are coming back.

2322
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:11,100
Um, what's interesting, and, uh, Bobby really broke this down on his show, so

2323
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:14,420
I'll, I'll give him a shout out if you want to get the exact numbers on a Bobby

2324
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:19,460
Blackwell show, but he was kind of going on about how, um, the sliders, you know,

2325
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,980
they're a little bit hidden, but they always kind of, I guess have been, at

2326
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:26,940
least for the last several years, the default numbers they're at are very

2327
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,420
interesting.

2328
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:35,980
It's something like 35% to Humble, 5% to charity, 60% to the developer, for a

2329
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,660
game and on books, it's even crazier.

2330
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:45,620
Um, and I guess the thought is, yes, they can bring the sliders back and it'll get,

2331
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:50,220
keep them in people's good graces and all that stuff, but they must think that

2332
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:54,140
there's a lot of people that are not even going to bother to check the sliders and

2333
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:57,940
just, you know, pay whatever and be on their way out the door without adjusting

2334
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:01,820
the sliders so that Humble can kind of intentionally take a bigger cut from the

2335
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,620
way the defaults are designed now.

2336
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:09,980
Um, which, um, is not terribly surprising and, and probably right in that thinking

2337
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:12,500
that there's going to be a lot of people who just click the buy button without

2338
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,420
changing the sliders.

2339
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:19,420
Um, but at least there's an option now and you can, buyer beware and you can just,

2340
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:20,900
you know, make the decision for yourself.

2341
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:23,060
Now, you know, sliders are there, look for them.

2342
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:27,860
But, um, I thought that whole, the whole reversal is kind of interesting.

2343
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:33,300
Um, I, I am surprised though, actually, that they did reverse their position

2344
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:37,260
because, uh, and you know, I think we talked about this when we, this story

2345
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:42,380
first came up, but I think, uh, we figured that the Humble store was probably in a

2346
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:46,180
little bit of trouble and needed to do something to make some money fast.

2347
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:50,740
Um, and so this unpopular decision, because the alternative is no more Humble

2348
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,740
store at all.

2349
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:56,020
Um, and so they probably did this decision as a sort of a, this is how we can kind

2350
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,460
of save ourselves financially.

2351
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:05,100
Um, the fact that they've had to retreat and change this back could end up doing

2352
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:05,580
the company.

2353
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:08,660
Maybe, uh, we'll see.

2354
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:10,500
So, uh, I hope not.

2355
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:14,580
Uh, I like that there's options out there, but, uh, we'll see what happens in the

2356
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,260
coming months.

2357
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:16,420
All right.

2358
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,900
Interesting followup tonight.

2359
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:22,660
Let's get to the part of the show where we have our listener round table.

2360
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:26,900
So we're going to accept your questions through our chat room and of course the

2361
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:31,060
mailbag and something else I'll get to in a minute here, but first let's see what

2362
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:32,540
our email situation looks like.

2363
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:37,340
Well, we go to participate at orange lounge radio.com and, uh, check out any

2364
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,820
emails that may have come in this week.

2365
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:39,780
I thought there was email.

2366
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:40,820
I thought there was one.

2367
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:41,460
Am I wrong?

2368
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:44,180
No, maybe I, there is zero.

2369
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:44,620
All right.

2370
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:46,420
I guess I confused it with last week's pile.

2371
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:47,060
How about that?

2372
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:50,820
Jack race talk, except I'm not really watching anything else.

2373
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,820
It's not on it's over.

2374
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:56,260
Uh, I didn't watch any of the other, other, uh, locations.

2375
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:56,580
Oh yeah.

2376
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:58,220
There's the Australia one is going on, right?

2377
01:57:58,220 --> 01:58:00,060
Or down, excuse me, it's Australia and New Zealand.

2378
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:00,700
So it's down under.

2379
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:05,700
So I I'm y'all as much as I love that show and I love a lot of people have been on it.

2380
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,540
It's, it's too much.

2381
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:11,460
It's just too fucking much at this point, like with all the different countries and

2382
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,100
all this stuff.

2383
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:16,780
So DJ Rama S is suggesting now it has to be dead by daylight talk.

2384
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:21,020
If you don't send emails, then Jamie and I have free license to talk about as much dead

2385
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,020
by daylight as we want.

2386
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,620
I do kind of like that idea.

2387
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,540
That's a very good idea.

2388
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:26,140
I will take that into consideration.

2389
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:31,140
However, I mentioned that we would do something new here and I intend to follow

2390
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:37,460
through on that and that is that we are going to get some of your comments that you have

2391
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:43,820
left throughout the week in our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord

2392
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:49,020
because a lot of you guys post tweets, you post stories, you post things that we haven't

2393
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:50,900
always gotten around to on this show.

2394
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:55,100
So I think we need to dedicate this listener round table or at least a portion of this

2395
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:55,500
to that.

2396
01:58:55,500 --> 01:59:01,140
And the reality is you guys don't always ask a lot in chat and so I want to get questions

2397
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,660
and feedback from other places.

2398
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:07,140
So we'll talk about some of the stuff that's in our discord.

2399
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:11,260
Although now, of course, the week I'm saying you guys don't usually ask a lot in chat.

2400
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:12,740
It's blown up.

2401
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:18,500
So, uh, Phoenix 77 26 is suggesting, how about dead by daylight versus drag race?

2402
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:23,260
And DJ Rama S says this came up in conversation earlier with Phoenix 77 26 dead by

2403
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,740
daylight versus drag race.

2404
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:27,100
Well, it's funny you say that.

2405
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,060
Okay, let's let's take this conversation to a place you didn't expect.

2406
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:34,900
So dark soccer, you watch a lot of dead by daylight on twitch.

2407
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,140
And I got into this last week.

2408
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:39,700
Like you, you have been probably a heavier participant in twitch than you've ever been.

2409
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:40,980
Yeah, yeah.

2410
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:42,660
Which is great because you're also promoting the show.

2411
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,140
Well, yeah.

2412
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,700
And a few people have asked, you know, just when I mentioned to a podcast people have

2413
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:52,860
asked, so I'll indulge because it's the one chance I get to actually talk about another

2414
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:54,220
stream and somebody else's stream.

2415
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:57,220
Yeah, it's, it's usually perceived as tacky to do that.

2416
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:00,580
But if somebody opens the door and asks, then it's of course you're fine.

2417
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:00,900
Right.

2418
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:01,940
So, yeah.

2419
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:09,100
Um, so, uh, there's a lot of drag race alumnus that stream and they all stream dead by

2420
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:14,700
daylight because again, it's, it's that LGBTQ culture kind of calls to this game.

2421
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:17,900
Uh, and, and now, and let's throw Dracula in as well.

2422
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:22,980
Cause I think like bitch Puddin, uh, from Dracula does like other stuff too.

2423
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:25,860
And I know it's done a lot of virtual drag shows, but I know she's played dead by

2424
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:26,900
daylight on stream as well.

2425
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,620
But, um, on China has a stream and does a lot of dead by daylight.

2426
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:33,100
Although she does some artistic stuff, things with her husband as well.

2427
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:38,020
Detox, uh, has been a more recent addition to Twitch has been streaming dead by daylight.

2428
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:39,860
I want to say he came into a chat.

2429
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:44,460
I was in Trixie watches some of the same people that dark soccer and I do.

2430
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:47,740
And I think she's done her own dead by daylight stream, but not very often.

2431
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,660
Like once in a blue moon, you'll see her doing it.

2432
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:55,620
If I think, if I'm right, I think it was an LC losing colors stream, which I may chat VIP.

2433
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:57,620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2434
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,660
Well, uh, losing color is a great, uh, uh, dead by daylight streamer.

2435
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:03,660
Shout out losing color, just kind of cool person.

2436
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:06,620
I really enjoy Nick and Prince as far as, um, killers go.

2437
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:09,340
And I think detox ended up rating him, uh, not that long ago.

2438
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:12,060
Um, yeah, there's a lot of great personalities out there.

2439
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:18,220
So another of my favorites is, uh, uh, lopin, I guess it's NA at the end.

2440
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:32,860
But another really, a really good one, but it's, it's the best thing has just been that it's bringing, I guess, the community better known and maybe middle known, I guess, together.

2441
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:38,780
Uh, and a lot of, um, non drag race drag streaming dead by daylight as well.

2442
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:42,100
London Bradshaw is one that comes to mind, who I think is really good.

2443
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:42,620
They're really good.

2444
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,620
Um, who, what deer?

2445
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:46,180
I think a lot of people know deer at this point.

2446
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:46,940
Evolution.

2447
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,180
Uh-huh.

2448
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:48,620
Uh-huh.

2449
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:57,300
Oh, evolution has done some funny freaking videos, Sutton fister or something like that is her name does dead by daylight as well.

2450
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:57,940
Yeah, I think so.

2451
02:01:58,060 --> 02:01:58,420
Yeah.

2452
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,260
There's a lot of, there's a lot of good talent on there.

2453
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:03,020
So, um, yeah, anyway, so there you go.

2454
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:03,860
There you go.

2455
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:08,740
Uh, there there's as requested by daylight cross drag race talk.

2456
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:12,380
Loki's sitting there going, I didn't request this.

2457
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,140
I did not request this.

2458
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:20,140
Also noticed in my background there that, uh, this, so this is earth defense force world heroes.

2459
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:25,500
It's that like 3d.game heroes meets earth defense force and the character just dabbed on the windscreen.

2460
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:26,980
I don't know what the feel about that.

2461
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,100
So, okay, we'll see.

2462
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:32,300
Bonds, double six chat says, Rob said dead by daylight versus drag race.

2463
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,500
And my girlfriend was like, who's making that?

2464
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:35,580
Cause I want it now.

2465
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,500
All right, let's indulge one more, one more.

2466
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:44,660
Dead by daylight announces a new RuPaul's drag race pack.

2467
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:49,900
Who is the killer and who is the survivor in a RuPaul's drag race?

2468
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:51,140
Dead by daylight pack.

2469
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,260
Who is the killer and who is the survivor?

2470
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:54,100
Loki, what would you say?

2471
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,380
No, I have no idea who anybody is on that show.

2472
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:00,620
Of course, our survivor, you know, who it would be?

2473
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:01,100
Who?

2474
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,100
The one who always comes back.

2475
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,260
Hallelu.

2476
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:05,700
Oh, Shangela.

2477
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:06,300
Okay.

2478
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,140
Shangela.

2479
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:17,860
And then the enemy, the killer would be Roxy Andrews.

2480
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,580
And she's here to make it clear.

2481
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,980
Yeah, no, no, no.

2482
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:28,340
It would be, what's her face, um, from the one who's been causing

2483
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:30,140
all that shit on from season one.

2484
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:34,580
Oh, Tammy Brown or not Tammy Brown.

2485
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,140
No.

2486
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:39,860
Um, Chanel?

2487
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:44,420
No, the one who was, like, threatening the bomb drag con and all that.

2488
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:46,420
Oh, that was season two, Tyra Sanchez.

2489
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:47,820
Yeah, Tyra Sanchez.

2490
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,220
Oh, that's okay.

2491
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:49,580
Okay.

2492
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:50,140
All right.

2493
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:53,940
There's so many people in chat that are like, I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

2494
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:54,900
Okay, I'll wrap this up.

2495
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:57,100
Look, hey, look, y'all brought it up in chat.

2496
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:00,660
This segment is for Bonds006's girlfriend only.

2497
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,700
Everyone else fast forward.

2498
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:04,140
Okay.

2499
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:09,300
Uh, then I would say so for the, for the killer and the survivor.

2500
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:10,780
Oh, this is such a tough one.

2501
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:12,580
The killer would be the producers.

2502
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:21,100
Um, the, oh, light profusion suggests Katya is a killer.

2503
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,060
That's a really good one.

2504
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:29,180
Um, by the way, I don't shout out a lot of the like celebrity podcasts very often, but I am going to say.

2505
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:32,660
The Bald and the Beautiful, um, Katya and Trixie's podcast.

2506
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:38,860
They just did an episode with Katya and her mom and the mom is, it's not actually her mom.

2507
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:39,700
Spoiler alert.

2508
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:45,100
And if you know, if you know your comedians, you will recognize her voice in the first five seconds.

2509
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:49,100
It is the Tracy Elman, Julie Tanuta, Devin Green.

2510
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:50,220
Oh, okay.

2511
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:52,700
Welcome to my home.

2512
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:58,820
It's her and it's the, it's the funniest fucking thing I've heard in a very long time.

2513
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:00,740
So just shout out for that.

2514
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,460
I will say that.

2515
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:05,780
So yeah, I, y'all, I'm thinking Katya is the killer.

2516
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,700
I think light profusion might be onto something.

2517
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:12,220
I think I just would see it except she, she'd be a flop killer.

2518
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:16,140
And that's okay.

2519
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:18,140
She'd be like, oh, they got out the gate.

2520
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:21,620
Oh, well, I'll just do some splits.

2521
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:23,020
Uh, so I like that.

2522
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:26,020
Um, let's see who would the survivor be though?

2523
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,700
Like now that Shangela answer was too fucking good.

2524
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:31,380
I'm going to say Naomi Smalls, who I'm also seeing in chat.

2525
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:35,940
Cause Naomi's got legs like, like Naomi Smalls would have sprint burst too.

2526
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:38,620
So there you go.

2527
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:39,140
All right.

2528
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:39,860
Enough.

2529
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:42,380
I promise new stuff.

2530
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:42,740
All right.

2531
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:48,580
Let's get to the discord where you guys have been posting some things throughout the week, uh, including tiger claw.

2532
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:56,540
Wanted to point out that there is a, some eighties action heroes that are coming to call of duty, including Rambo and John McClane from dead hard.

2533
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:57,540
So guess what?

2534
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:58,380
Dead by daylight.

2535
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:01,740
Isn't the only one that gets licensed stuff to try to sweeten up their game.

2536
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:04,220
But apparently, uh, this is happening as well.

2537
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:09,540
These are movie skins that tie in with the 1984 Verdansk map in the game.

2538
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:10,900
So there's that.

2539
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:12,340
Hmm.

2540
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,620
Uh, let's see some other comments.

2541
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:18,260
SSJ 100, Matt thought this was right up dark soccer's alley.

2542
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:19,420
So let's see.

2543
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:24,780
It is a Digimon interactive fitness tracker, a vital bracelet, digital monster.

2544
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,620
It's now available for pre-order.

2545
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:29,860
Uh, and it is a 65 or $75.

2546
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:35,420
I don't know what the difference is, but it looks like it's a little bracelet, like a Fitbit, but it actually has a Digimon that's like on it.

2547
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,140
Like almost like a Tamagotchi or something.

2548
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:41,620
So did I say dead hard?

2549
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:43,300
Like I was still thinking dead by daylight.

2550
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:45,860
I meant, I meant die hard.

2551
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:46,340
Sorry.

2552
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:52,620
Like I'm like, what the chat is going like, you said dead hard, dead hard is an ability in dead by daylight.

2553
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:52,940
Sorry.

2554
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:53,980
All right.

2555
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:55,740
Um, let's see.

2556
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:06,420
Oh, Tiger Claw had also pointed out that the, uh, voice actress and motion capture for the infamous Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil 8 has unveiled who she is.

2557
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:21,140
It is Maggie Robertson, who you can find on Twitter at Maggie the Bard, who said in a tweet, so we finally meet thrilled to finally announce I was the voiceover and performance capture artist behind our beloved Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village.

2558
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:26,580
Such an honor to be a part of this video game and bring this, ahem, huge character to life.

2559
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:34,060
Well, I feel bad for the replies or it's going to be just a mess.

2560
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:40,860
Her convention rate just doubled knowing that she's Lady Dimitrescu.

2561
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:42,780
I mean, she can ask for more money and get it.

2562
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:49,300
Uh, Phoenix7726 is wondering because there is a diehard skin in Call of Duty, is Call of Duty now a Christmas game?

2563
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,460
Always has been, right?

2564
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,180
Always has been.

2565
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:59,100
Well, he had a Christmas map in Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, the first one, like the old Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.

2566
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:05,340
They had a Christmas map, um, that every skin of a map that they did it, that was a Christmas one.

2567
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:09,900
So technically it's always been Christmas game.

2568
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:21,460
Dungeon Buster sharing an interesting article from PCGamesN.com about after nine years, a judge has thrown out a World of Warcraft patent lawsuit.

2569
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:28,860
A court granted Activision's request for the World's Inc. claim of patent infringement to be declared invalid.

2570
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:38,460
So what happened, Worlds was essentially claiming to have invented the idea of 3D multiplayer in which a server would filter the number of users visible to any particular player

2571
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:41,260
without getting specific about how it wanted to accomplish that.

2572
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:47,460
Blizzard in court said that this isn't an idea you can own a patent for, and nine years later, a judge agrees.

2573
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:50,660
That's how long some of these things take to settle, just so you know.

2574
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:51,100
For sure.

2575
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:51,620
Yeah.

2576
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:52,660
All right.

2577
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:55,260
Um, let's see some other comments here.

2578
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:59,580
Some of these stories we actually talked about a little bit earlier, and I don't want to read everything.

2579
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:03,380
Um, did we talk about the Stadia thing?

2580
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,100
I thought for sure I show-rolled that.

2581
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:06,500
No, don't.

2582
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:07,380
What Stadia thing?

2583
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:11,060
Uh, that six more Google Stadia staff members left the company.

2584
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,540
Uh, general manager.

2585
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:13,620
The measurements company.

2586
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:13,860
Yeah.

2587
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:14,340
Yeah.

2588
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:16,820
General manager, head of creative services and more.

2589
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:19,540
Uh, they've all left to join Haven studio at Sony.

2590
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:24,300
Kind of an interesting wheelchair that was shared by Tiger Claw in a quick little tweet there.

2591
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:25,380
So there's that.

2592
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:26,940
Interesting.

2593
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,420
So, um,

2594
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:29,860
I've got a last minute.

2595
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:30,860
Sorry, if you want to do that.

2596
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:31,980
Yes, please.

2597
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:40,460
So, uh, one game that's supposed to be out sometime this year, but we don't know when though is Psychonauts 2.

2598
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:41,540
Well,

2599
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:47,620
somehow the Xbox app is allowing folks to preload the game.

2600
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:56,300
So it's about 27 gigabytes and it's being preloaded, but we still don't know when it's coming out.

2601
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:59,340
I imagine soon then if that's the case.

2602
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:00,620
I must be soon.

2603
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:03,660
It will be a hackers will get in there first if they don't watch it.

2604
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:05,580
Yeah.

2605
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,700
Any other last minute stories?

2606
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:10,620
No, that was all I had.

2607
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:16,500
Well, that was all the shout outs I had from, uh, act deaf to suggesting E3 surprise release, perhaps.

2608
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:18,620
Probably a surprise in quotes.

2609
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:20,820
Now it got leaked to like most E3 things do.

2610
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:21,540
So there you go.

2611
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:27,980
Um, so anyway, I do want to give a shout out one more time for our discord vog network.com slash discord.

2612
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:30,980
And for all the stories you guys leave in there throughout the week, keep it coming.

2613
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:33,900
So, um, I, I found a good place to kind of fit that in the show now.

2614
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:34,580
So there you go.

2615
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:37,700
We'll, we'll be sure to read more of those, um, in the future.

2616
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:42,060
Um, but with that, I think we're down towards the end of the show.

2617
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:45,580
If there's no more last minute stories, I think it's time to get final thoughts.

2618
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,300
Um, before we get to final thoughts, I do.

2619
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:54,660
And of course, thank everybody out there for listening, whether you were listening live here on Sunday night at twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.

2620
02:10:54,900 --> 02:11:03,020
Or if you were listening to the podcast feed throughout the week, whether it was on Spotify or iTunes or wherever it is, uh, that you choose to listen to podcasts.

2621
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,940
Thank you for making orange launch radio part of your week.

2622
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:06,260
Uh, really appreciate it.

2623
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:08,820
Uh, give, give us a holler on Twitter at OLR.

2624
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,140
Say hello, let us know you're out there.

2625
02:11:10,420 --> 02:11:11,100
Emails.

2626
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:16,580
We need more of them, uh, or, or we'll, we'll continue this dead by daylight fan, uh, dry grace fantasy next week.

2627
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:26,660
Uh, I just, I almost said, um, my, uh, vanilla mocha fantasy or whatever it was that, uh, Valentina thought about or talked about.

2628
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,820
And now I'm like, Valentina would be a great killer.

2629
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:30,340
Don't you think?

2630
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:31,100
Hmm.

2631
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:36,340
Anyway, so it's dead by drag races, dead by drag race, drag by daylight.

2632
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:38,460
I think might actually be from a pod culture.

2633
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:40,140
Pod culture and chat is a good one.

2634
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:40,460
Anyway.

2635
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:41,100
All right.

2636
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:41,860
Uh, so there you go.

2637
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:43,420
Participate at orange launch radio.com.

2638
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:48,940
If you want to send us an email, um, you guys don't have to, um, give money for the show.

2639
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:50,260
We'll continue to do it for free.

2640
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:56,260
I just want to appreciate and acknowledge those of you that have subscribed here at VOG network and donated biddies, um, throughout the night.

2641
02:11:56,460 --> 02:12:00,820
I will read all of you a little bit later after the credits and give you some personalized thanks.

2642
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:06,900
Um, but I will also say that, uh, the shop, uh, as well, if you feel so inclined to vog network.com slash shop.

2643
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:10,980
Um, and then, uh, of course, um, just thank you.

2644
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:12,260
Word of mouth goes a long way.

2645
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:20,700
Uh, tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then, uh, you know, so, uh, get your friends to listen.

2646
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:24,180
A host here at Twitch probably does more than anything.

2647
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:27,380
Even if you don't stream that much yourself, you probably have your friends following you.

2648
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:30,340
So a host will go a long, long way.

2649
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:34,260
So I thank you to all of you that host vog network on your own Twitch feeds.

2650
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:34,940
Okay.

2651
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:36,180
I think we can wrap up.

2652
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:36,740
That's it.

2653
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:38,180
Well, don't forget.

2654
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:43,060
After, after the show, um, stay, uh, stay tuned.

2655
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:49,020
Um, because outcomes, my, uh, my new segment sounds good.

2656
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:52,460
And for those that are on the podcast feed and they're like, Oh shit, I missed it.

2657
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:59,260
Um, your archives on your personal channel, dark SACRA underscore O L R are open.

2658
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:01,580
So if somebody wants to watch it after the fact, they can.

2659
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:03,180
Indeed.

2660
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:03,660
Yes.

2661
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:06,300
So just, just for the podcast, these don't get to see it live.

2662
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:09,300
Um, so let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2663
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:10,740
So, um, Loki, I'll start with you.

2664
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:11,540
Your final thought tonight.

2665
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:17,380
My final thought is going to be working more on Minecraft and, uh, Oh, I, I don't

2666
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:18,540
know if I talked about that.

2667
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:21,860
I don't remember if I talked about the labels that got, um, so I did get my

2668
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,500
labels finally for pixel poops.

2669
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:28,980
Number two, they were all jacked up, so I don't know what the ha what happened, but

2670
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:33,700
somewhere in the shipping or something, they shrunk, but they didn't shrink in a

2671
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:38,460
uniform, they, they shrunk and it looked like someone had taken the label off and

2672
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,780
put it back on and they were really shrunk and distorted.

2673
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:45,900
And so I got the back follow up with the next week because I haven't heard back

2674
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,940
from since like Tuesday, because they were supposed to be resolving the issue,

2675
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,420
but yeah, they were all jacked up.

2676
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:52,460
So yeah, it's unfortunate.

2677
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:53,740
They look cool though.

2678
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,220
All right.

2679
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:59,780
My final thought is a very vague, uh, big changes are coming in a few months.

2680
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:04,580
And, uh, I, to, to quote, uh, a famous monologue, I'm so excited.

2681
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:05,300
I'm so excited.

2682
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:06,020
I'm so scared.

2683
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:06,980
All right.

2684
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:10,220
Uh, dark, dark soccer, your final thought.

2685
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:16,580
Um, I should probably make my tiramisu and I'm really afraid I'm

2686
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:17,780
going to play very badly tonight.

2687
02:14:18,980 --> 02:14:19,420
You know what?

2688
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:20,460
It's about having fun.

2689
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:23,940
You don't have to, the thing about a lot of these, uh, folks we've been

2690
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:27,300
shouting out on a Twitch, yes, they're good, but they didn't, they weren't

2691
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,340
good overnight took them a long time to get good.

2692
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:32,100
So, all right, keep working on it.

2693
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:32,740
All right.

2694
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:35,220
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

2695
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:37,900
I cannot believe I didn't say this anywhere in the show.

2696
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:42,580
Uh, I'm very sorry about that, but I hope all of our mothers out there, our gaming

2697
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:44,940
mommies had a very happy mother's day.

2698
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:51,100
And if you are somebody who, uh, um, you're just a mother figure, a pet mom

2699
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:54,580
or something like that, whatever the case may be a happy mother's day to you.

2700
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:57,980
Uh, and all our gaming moms out there, uh, at orange lounge radio.

2701
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:59,460
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

2702
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:00,660
We'll see you in seven days.

2703
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:01,540
Good night.

2704
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:05,420
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2705
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:11,940
