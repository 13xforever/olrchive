1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
While I was skimming the news tonight, none of the articles really jumped out at me. New

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,840
consoles, new games, retro consoles, retro games, fan mods, mashups, etc. I realized

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,100
that this was the news. That we are smack in the middle of the transitionary period

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,720
where the gaming world moves around between the big earth-shattering announcements. It's

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000
that very pleasant middle ground of news that is all good, but without yours truly having

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,280
to skirt around the most obvious thing to reference. This is the meta intro, now it's

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,360
time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about actual news. Starting

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,960
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again today,

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,280
May the 23rd of 2021 with episode number 870 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,440
you here live on Twitch TV at channel VOG Network where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,320
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I am joined by, of course,

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,560
the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,080
Hello.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,800
How are you doing?

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
I am well rested.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
Good. Yes. We were talking a little bit about that before the show.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,520
Yeah. I'm also not used to having like this extra light now. It's kind of getting in my eyes.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes. But I love the lighting looks great where you're at. It's good.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:42,160
Thanks. Well, I invested in a new ring light. Thank goodness for TJ Maxx and the fact that

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,040
they've got like 50,000 different ring lights for anywhere between like 12 to 40 bucks.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,800
Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad, but.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,960
No, I'm going to say it because I want my fellow indies out there to be able to afford some good

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,680
ass lighting.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,440
Well, and I've noticed in general that a lot of stores out there are starting to kind of cater to

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,520
this streaming broadcasting culture. You know, I go into Best Buy and I'm looking for, I think

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,840
I was looking for a microphone or something. And there's this whole little section about like

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
influencers and they have microphones for influencers and cameras and the lighting and

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,920
that stuff. It's like a big thing. And it's, you know, obviously we've been doing this a very long

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,800
time coming up on 19 years next month. And so it does make me do this double take about.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,600
This is stuff like now they sell it a Best Buy. This used to be the stuff that like you had to

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,720
be a total geek and go to Radio Shack to get. I could hear the Travis Donovan, our dear friend

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
from Understation Life. I could hear his old man rant building in my head about you kids today.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,720
Oh, I mean, it took me, it only took me 18 years to upgrade to a good mic, so whatever.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Same here at OLR. Going to chat.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
I can't go back from using this sucker.

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Oh, we'll figure it out. In chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network,

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,080
Act Def says street vendors in Mexico sell LED lights and cans now. That's fascinating.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,320
You know, I think I've seen like the clips for phones. I've seen like the selfie lights.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I've seen those at street vendors and I see a lot of like the color LED lights,

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,280
like like sports fans waving them around a stadium, things like that.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
But like to the extent that you're talking about for like influences, it's just

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,000
it's fascinating. We're in that type of culture. All right. Well, let's see if our other old man

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
here at Orange Launch Radio has a has a rant or two about it. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
What's a Radio Shack?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
This story. You've been to a Radio Shack, Loki.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Give me a break. I'm sure you miss it, too. Come on.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Are you a geriatric millennial?

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Is that a contradiction?

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,480
Ask Rob.

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,280
That's a yes. It's my one viral tweet. Well, look, Radio Shack was a store that was open

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,920
back in the day that that game that's playing behind you tonight was popular.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
Actually, I don't think that game was ever popular. It was just kind of like a cult game

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,160
that people do, because it's but it was featured in, you know, a feature length movie.

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,720
That's true.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,000
And it was used as the theme music for a Strong Bad segment.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
And it was so rad, of course, for the podcast listeners who can't see it.

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,720
He's got Rad Racer, the eight bit classic on the NES with its 3D mode playing behind him right now.

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,200
Actually, it's not in 3D right now, though. It's it is that horrible red and blue thing

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,160
when you have it in 3D. But it worked. I don't think it's in 3D mode right now.

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
No, it's not. It's not. It looked when you hit. I think you hit the select button to toggle it

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,080
back in the day. And it's like it takes away everything. And it's just like red and blue lines.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,520
And it's it's not that great, because all you see is like a little added depth. And of course,

65
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,240
the old school 80s glasses that kind of would give you a headache after not that long. You know,

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
it wasn't great technology. We've come a long way in our 3D technology, that's for sure.

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,920
But yeah, it was, you know, that's how everybody knew Rad Racer. A lot of people forget it was a

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Square well, now Square Enix, but Square game, because most people only know them through the

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,440
role playing games. Yeah, so I don't know. I thought it'd be a fun game to put back there.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,680
Yeah, it is. Orange Right in chat says it's that game from the wizard. It's so bad. Yes,

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,120
yes, it is. All right, um, we're gonna get in. Yeah, what can I interject something really off

72
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:45,840
topic right now? I suppose Lady Gaga got the keys to West Hollywood today. She didn't already have

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,760
them. Like I thought and all I can care about are those platform boots she has because I want them.

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,400
Like, if gay rights were a Starbucks card, Lady Gaga would have like 1500 still waiting to be

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
spent on her account. Like, she just now got the keys to West Hollywood. Really?

76
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,960
I just like didn't realize that West Hollywood actually was considered a city that had a key.

77
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Yeah. All right. Okay, well, speaking of off topic random things, I will say a happy I doubt

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,880
he's listening, but I'll say happy birthday anyway to Shad Starzik or Shane. His birthday,

79
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,200
it's actually today. So it's not it's not like, you know, oh, it was Tuesday or something. It's

80
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,360
actually today. Bringing him up also makes me think of this. This isn't technically our kickoff

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,920
tonight, but too bad. I'm gonna talk about this anyway. It is gaming. He texted me something

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,160
earlier this week because he reads he reads a lot of those web forums like reset era and that stuff.

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,800
I think, Loki, you're in tune to a lot of that stuff, too. I don't really I don't I see this

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,560
stuff on Twitter, but I don't see like a lot of the forums and that stuff. But he sent me something

85
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
that was posted on one of those forums, which was like arcade one up leaks that are coming up.

86
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,680
And yeah, I saw that. And apparently the person that leaked it is kind of like a YouTuber that's

87
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
kind of known for this stuff. So it's not like out of the blue rando. My uncle works at arcade

88
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,960
one up type of thing like this is. So anyway, long story short, it looks like a Tron machine

89
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,960
is coming from arcade one up. It's going to have Tron and discs of Tron. And I absolutely had my

90
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,480
God damn it moment. And I think we've talked about this on the show before. There's that thing. And

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,960
when you see it, you just know you're not going to. It's just you see it. You'll God damn it. And

92
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,600
it's the sound of your wallet just unloading. And that, you know, and I've said it on the show,

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,640
I don't have room. I don't have money for another one of those arcade one up machines. But God damn

94
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,840
it, I'm getting the Tron machine. I'm getting it. I have to, assuming it's legit and confirmed and

95
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,120
all that stuff. And there's there was other ones, too, that there was a Simpsons machine

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
that was in there, too. And I'm I'm sure that one is going to actually be really because people

97
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
really fondly remember that Simpsons arcade game. We're talking about this a little bit on Bobby

98
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Blackwell's show because he's on live before us. And a very interesting connection I didn't realize

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,880
because somebody in chat during his show has said, oh, I don't know if it's going to be real because

100
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,280
Disney is not going to let Tron go. And we actually were kind of like, well, actually,

101
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Disney owns Star Wars and Star Wars has already had some arcade one up cabinets. And then that

102
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,800
was kind of like the aha moment of right. Disney owns The Simpsons now, too. I forgot that. But

103
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
that's why all the Simpsons stuff is on Disney Plus and of course, with the Fox and all that.

104
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,160
So The Simpsons and Tron have that in common. There's a Disney connection there.

105
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:50,640
So I will find the Disney connection. I don't know. Like I, I know when I saw the

106
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,160
Paw Patrol cabinet, I was like, I was going to say that's that's one, too. I get that.

107
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,080
We never we never had a Muppets cabinet, did we? Because Jamie breaking in a song.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,600
I don't think there was ever a Muppets like game. Well, I think there were like console games

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,120
that weren't very good. And I think there were some edutainment Kermit games. And if you want

110
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
to kind of tie that to Sesame Street, I think that certainly Sesame Street's had its share.

111
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,680
But the Muppets, the Muppets. I want to say there was like an adventure game on Commodore 64,

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,840
you know, because I would have an arcade cabinet. Yeah, nothing arcadey that I can think of. So

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,240
there's that. Oh, SSG-100 Matt with the clip. Thank you for that. That reminds me,

114
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
OK, I remember when the God damn it moment was it was something that happened with Jamie.

115
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
And it was also an arcade one up story because we were talking about the Capcom cabinet

116
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,080
and it had Strider in it. And Jamie went, God damn it.

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm I'm apparently a meme now. Had a God damn it moment. All right.

118
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,800
Act Dev says, I think there's Muppet games on the Wii. Well, we had everything. Give me a break.

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,320
All right. Anyway, so there's there's that little rumor. And I'm like, I'm very excited about the

120
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
Tron cabinet at the same time. I'm very pissed off about it. I'm sure you can understand. Like,

121
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
why did it have to be now? All right. Well, speaking of classics. Well, and you're going

122
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,360
to have room for it, so. Well, in the future, I might, but nothing as of yet. So. All right.

123
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,960
But you know what? You know what? You know what? You know what? You have a friend that you can

124
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,640
store that at. I see what you're getting at. Who still has no room.

125
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,760
All right. Anyway, speaking of classics, let's get into some talk about Nintendo Switch online

126
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,200
and the classics library that's on the Nintendo Switch, because that is, of course, something

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,320
that's continuing to grow. And they just made some big announcements this week that more games are

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
going to be added, including Joe and Mac, which, for whatever reason, was called Caveman Ninja

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,240
here, which is on this. Yeah. Yeah. I always saw it as Joe and Mac. No way. It's the other way

130
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,520
around. It's Joe and Mac here and Caveman Ninja overseas, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I got it backwards.

131
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry. But anyway, that is going to be one of the games that's coming. Magical Drop 2, which I

132
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,120
forgot was even on Super Nintendo, is coming as well. And Ninja Zaya Marukun is coming out as well.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,120
And then there's some differences between Japan and the US. Japan is getting a Fire Emblem game,

134
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,720
Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War. They don't want to translate that for the US or when they do,

135
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,840
they'll charge us more money for it. And then Spanky's Quest, as well as Super Baseball Simulator

136
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:51,680
1-0-0-0 are additional games that are coming for us here in the US. Now, the reason why I

137
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,960
kind of bring this up at the top of the show tonight is because this means that the Nintendo

138
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:04,160
Switch Online library has crossed 100 games. It's kind of hit a milestone. Obviously, people still

139
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,640
have their criticisms of Nintendo Switch Online. I think we've all been a little bit critical here

140
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,880
on OLR about it because we feel like there's still a lot of stuff missing from it. How do

141
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
you feel about how far Nintendo Switch Online has come? And what do you think is kind of like

142
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:27,040
missing that still needs to be added? Let me just go ahead and say Super Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger,

143
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,920
Earthbound, The Guardian Legend. All right. I think I've named all the big ones. Outside of

144
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,720
that, the ones we all know about. What are some things that are kind of like missing? Do you

145
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,120
think this whole Switch Online, Super Nintendo, Nintendo library, do you think it is making a

146
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,640
good deal for having a Nintendo Online membership? Or is Nintendo not doing enough still? Or like,

147
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,520
where's your head at with all this now that we're so far into it and 100 games into it? Loki,

148
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,640
I got to start with you because I know you're going to have something to say about Nintendo.

149
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,400
I think that 100 games by now is not really enough. They could be doing so much more with

150
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,440
that. I'm just having a hard time believing with the catalog that they had before that they

151
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
just can't get those on there or like workout licensing deals with these guys. And not even

152
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
necessarily licensing deals. I mean, they have their own like first party tiles, not everything's

153
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,240
on there. So I just think there's so much more they could be doing. Dar Sakura, any opinion?

154
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
I honestly just think that they're being cautious with the rollout. I mean,

155
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,120
there's certainly games that I would like to see. Like, I don't recall if I saw Kirby's

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,600
Avalanche on there, which is like my, that was my Puyo Puyo introduction.

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,080
I think they just straight, they just have Puyo Puyo in it. They even put that in the US

158
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:55,760
version. So I don't know if they put the Kirby branded one in there. He got the six in one game

159
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,640
in the Super Nintendo era with the Kirby Superstar or whatever it was called. And the

160
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:08,880
mini golf game is there too. But there's a bunch of other just like really kind of quirky games

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
that I think would be well to come out. I mean, I've certainly covered a few. Like,

162
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,280
I would like to have some more shooter games. You know, if they're going to get some other

163
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:30,000
third party games, why don't we get something like UN Squadron or, what was the other stuff

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,800
I played? Or back in the Nintendo ones like SkyShark, you know, get some of those

165
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,080
cutaway games and a little bit more of the compile stuff.

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,240
Good call out. I think, you know, obviously there's the big ones that I named that are

167
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,560
still missing. I think for a lot of people, whether it's licensing or concern about the

168
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,240
lines of Parody and Earthbound or whatever it is, obviously those are glaring omissions

169
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
that continue to kind of spotlight what's missing and have a lot of the fandoms kind

170
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,280
of like focused on that a little bit. I don't know if Super Mario RPG will ever happen. Although,

171
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,720
why shouldn't it? Like what does Square have to lose from an agreement like that? There's a lot

172
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,040
I kind of don't understand with that, but whatever. I'm not on the business side of things. So it's

173
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,480
hard for me to say. What is still missing for me that kind of blows my mind that Nintendo still has

174
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,840
capitalized on this is the other systems. Like, you know, if the Switch is meant to be like a

175
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,840
portable system and a system that sits on the dock on played on the TV and 64. Well, there's that.

176
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,560
But I'm also more thinking, where's Game Boy and Game Boy Advance and Color Game Boy? Where's like

177
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,840
Pokemon Pinball? Where's, you know, the Mario game that was on Game Boy? Where's, you know,

178
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,280
the Zelda? Does the Switch have one? I think it does. Yeah. Okay. So then, yeah, that would be

179
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:59,360
easy. Yeah. So yeah, I don't understand why these don't exist in the library yet. Like the Game Boy

180
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,400
stuff is long since overdue and I hope Nintendo is going to think about making an announcement.

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,560
And I would agree that Nintendo 64 also pretty long overdue at this point. Especially, you know,

182
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
to revisit classics like Pokemon Snap. Although yes, I'm sure Nintendo would rather you play the

183
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
new one, but there's going to come a time when the new one isn't selling like crazy anymore.

184
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,880
And revisiting the old school Pokemon Snap would be a delight, but maybe they're also noticing

185
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,480
people are willing. I mean, they could have given away Mario 64 for free, but why should they when

186
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,280
they did that Mario 3D All-Star collection limited time and charge 20 bucks for it? If it's 60 divided

187
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,320
by three, 20 bucks for it, and people still paid it. And so that kind of goes in line with what

188
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,160
Bobby is saying in chat. Bobby Blackwolf says, Square realized people will pay for their old ROMs.

189
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,600
And I think that's kind of like this tricky place we're at with Nintendo online is now it's like,

190
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,120
okay, so some games you'll give away with the membership, but others you're so protective of,

191
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,800
you're going to sell them in a bundle or whatever, or do a $5 standalone, which I think ultimately

192
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,720
is what happens with Earthbound. I think Earthbound will be released, but you're going to

193
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,640
have to pay money for it outside of the Switch online collection. And they're going to do

194
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,160
something stupid to justify why it's a separate cost. Like, oh, it's a special anniversary edition

195
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,360
with some extra art in this menu shell that we put with it and a digital version of the instruction

196
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,680
manual. And we're going to have GameStop sell a $50 version of Earthbound that comes with a little

197
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:41,840
statue. Like, I can, I can hear Loki rolling his eyes. But you don't have to hear it in person.

198
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,040
Is it isn't this literally their mo like, is anything I'm saying then don't make an effort

199
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,000
then then there's I get it that they want to do that with some other titles. But like, if that's

200
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,720
the case, then why don't we see a lot of these titles being? I mean, we see some of them being

201
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
released on these platforms as like collections and stuff, but not everything. So there's still

202
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
plenty of content that they can be putting on there and other systems that they can be adding

203
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,840
on it. And like I said, you know, Nintendo first party could do some stuff as well. Obviously,

204
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
we're not gonna see some Pokemon games getting added on there because they're gonna remake all

205
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,720
those. But like, then why even put forth the effort because that's your selling point. You're

206
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,600
like, okay, Nintendo online, you have online access, which kind of sucks. And then you have

207
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,280
access to the this library of games, but we're just not going to contribute to it because it,

208
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,000
you know, it's gonna grow over our other plans to screw you over by selling the piecemeal to you

209
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,600
like, it's not a plan to screw over. And it's the point of a business to be greedy and of store

210
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,120
but it's it's why it's why we all hate capitalism. Yes. I understand that. But then don't offer that

211
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,200
then don't even offer the games at all. And if that's that's going to be the issue if you're

212
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,200
gonna just sell these all piecemeal, then just don't do it. Because right now it's just like,

213
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I don't even know why we cover this every time they put games out on it. Like,

214
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,680
wow. Good business for them. They're three years, you know, 100 games. Good job. Good job,

215
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,920
you guys. That's way more than you ever had in your virtual console stores.

216
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,920
They're putting out enough to make Nintendo online attractive to the average user.

217
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,400
And they're putting them out as they see this is not going to be profitable to have standalone,

218
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,440
let's put it in with the service to again, make it attractive for people to want Nintendo online

219
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,320
beyond just a few games. And then the big games, the ones that they know that they're going to be

220
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,400
able to compile and have as a standalone, something that would bring in more revenue

221
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,840
than yes, I mean, it's honestly it's just business. It's not a, oh, they should do this because it's

222
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,840
convenient for us. It's their business model. End of story. And ultimately, the only way it's

223
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,760
going to change is to stop paying for a switch online. But I think a lot of people aren't going

224
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,120
to do it because there's too much other stuff like visiting Animal Crossing towns and playing

225
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,040
Mario Kart online or Smash Brothers online. There's too much other stuff tied to it that

226
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,720
people aren't going to want to let go of. So Nintendo looks at it and goes, success.

227
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,160
But I kind of once again, they don't even have to put out the games in. Just don't even offer

228
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,800
that. Just say, listen, it's just ten bucks a year or whatever it is, twenty dollars a year

229
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:27,520
to pay for just play online. Done. There you go. I really do see like both ends of the frustration

230
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,560
because like I also see that like when Nintendo launched this, they launched it with an A-list

231
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,600
lineup of 30 titles that kind of really set an expectation. And since then, they've been

232
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,800
buoying it with C-list titles and with an A-list very occasionally sprinkled in. Maybe in the first

233
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,680
update there were some, you know, but now we're like, let's be real. A lot of these games I just

234
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,720
talked about, they're not things where you're going to go like, oh my God. I mean, the magical

235
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,440
drop thing is kind of cool, but even I can admit that is kind of niche and most people are not

236
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,920
going to give a hoot about it. And so maybe I think that's where some of the frustration

237
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,880
in general comes in. I do want to read this comment from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network

238
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,480
because I honestly think Bobby hits it on the money here, literally saying, you know they won't do the

239
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,880
thing everyone wants in regards to Earthbound. A retail title, but it has Earthbound

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,080
beginnings, Earthbound, and finally a localized Mother 3. Yeah, Earthbound All-Stars, 60 bucks.

241
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,440
A lot of people would pay it. Absolutely. Why not? And it will even come with a shitty statue of

242
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,520
something from the game, a little shitty NES statue or something. I want a Mr. Saturn.

243
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
A Mr. Saturn, yeah. Since someone stole my handmaid, Mr. Saturn. That's not nice.

244
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,480
Remember the one I made for GamerX? Yeah, I do. I do. Someone stole it. Man, those conventions

245
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,280
were so long ago. Time flies. Crazy, crazy. Anyhow, so yeah, the Nintendo Switch collection library,

246
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,160
it's nice that it's hit 100 games, but I think there's definitely that growing sense of

247
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,360
frustration of, are you just going to release these things in a package for 60 bucks? Or are

248
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,640
you going to give us more of the stuff we really want? And why are there entire systems that are

249
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,400
completely being untouched? No Game Boy, no Game Boy Advance, no N64. Even stuff as recent as Wii

250
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,440
and GameCube. I think all of us on the show would happily plunk down the money to play F-Zero GX all

251
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,520
over again. It's one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made. Why not? But for whatever

252
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,720
reason, Nintendo is just like, we'll wait and we'll do a celebration later on. No they won't.

253
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,920
We'll put an F-Zero track in Mario Kart and you'll like it. I also think that Nintendo sort of

254
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,760
goes on one of the same principles of a few other companies out there that I won't name

255
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,160
that like to put out, they'll put out the expected, expected, expected, and then they'll

256
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,120
throw a crazy curveball. The one thing that maybe people have been asking for, say a few years ago,

257
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,160
right? And then they kind of say, oh, well, it's not going to happen. And then all of a sudden,

258
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,760
boom, this collection comes out and it's amazing. Everyone wants to buy it.

259
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,760
I think that's when they've run out of ideas, basically. And then they start actually listening

260
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
to their fans instead of thinking that they know better. That's not it. Usually companies

261
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,280
do this on exactly on purpose. And this is why we get another Pikmin game.

262
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,480
All right. We needed an AR Pikmin game because Pikmin is so popular.

263
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,120
All right. Don't forget a Pikmin mobile game too. All right. Let's move on.

264
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,840
I can't wait. I'm just like, why aren't there more Pikmin games? Forget this F-Zero nonsense.

265
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,920
Where's my Pikmin? I'm trying to be open-minded about the mobile game, but we'll see. We'll see.

266
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,000
All right. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.

267
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,040
I know no one's playing that Pikmin game because it ain't out yet. Let's talk about our gaming

268
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,640
weeks and the types of things we have been playing this week. So Dark Sakura, how was

269
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,800
your gaming week? Well, it's not fucking Mass Effect yet. So my KVM switch arrived.

270
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,120
I will be working on my computer tomorrow. I intended to do it today, but someone slept 14

271
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,720
hours. Me. So I'm going to be hooking my PC back up, but I'm going to still play on my Mac through

272
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:35,840
Steam Link. Just because honestly, I hate my PC. I have been playing, of course, a lot of Dead by

273
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,680
Daylight because I'm really working on getting better. Although yesterday I had like a really

274
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,080
terrible trickster match, but it was also just for me to test my gigabit ethernet on a test

275
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,440
stream. So I wasn't really trying very hard. No, that was like the opposite of a sweaty game.

276
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,640
What's the opposite of a sweaty game? A well air conditioned game? I guess a frozen game.

277
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Frozen game. I'd say it's a fan game. Fanned. You know, like the fan. Anyway, I also am still

278
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,720
playing Wordscapes because it's like my brain wake up game. It's what I do. It's my bathroom game,

279
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,520
you know? And of course, Animal Crossing. I slacked off a little bit and I really need to not

280
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,080
slack off because I'm finally kicking Marina out in favor of getting Cyrano. I like what Siata

281
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:35,760
Berry says. A well ventilated game. Thank you. Thank you. And of course, I'm actually,

282
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,320
for reasons coming up later in this show, have a reason to play No Man's Sky.

283
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,800
You better hurry. It's limited. It's very limited time.

284
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,160
I know. And it's the 31st. So that means that I have to see. I think it runs on Mac,

285
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,200
so I shouldn't have any problem there. And of course, I'm playing Fantasian. And just to

286
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,920
reiterate, on Tuesdays at five o'clock Pacific time, I stream my playthrough of Fantasian. So

287
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,400
for folks who don't have Apple Arcade or Apple devices on which to play this,

288
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,600
if you're interested about the game, you know, I'm playing through. I'm exploring things that

289
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,800
people ask me to. Probably my next game is going to be a go back and open these chests. I couldn't

290
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:25,120
open session, but I'm trying to get through a full story element each time that I play. So

291
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,320
again, for those who don't have Apple Arcade, I'm playing through the game for you and for me.

292
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,200
Awesome. All right. It's a service, Rob. It's really a service.

293
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,440
I caught a little bit of the stream. I was lurking because I was watching on the TV,

294
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,920
so I don't really chat when I'm on the TV. Isn't that pretty?

295
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh yeah, it's a pretty game. Yeah, the whole thing about it,

296
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,360
like their niche on it is that, well, actually, Rob, you can do that through. I'll tell you

297
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,840
later, but you have a way to use my Apple Arcade account.

298
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,240
Yeah. And, well, it was all about more having a way to play it, but I actually, the show,

299
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
I could use the show's mini to play it if I wanted to.

300
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,680
You absolutely can. But going back to the thing about the game is that it's all hand-built

301
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:18,560
dioramas. So every background is made of real materials. Some of the enemies in the game have

302
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:31,440
real textures as their render textures. So there you go. Honestly, it's worth playing.

303
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:39,440
It's very fun. It definitely gives me a little bit more of an earlier Final Fantasy slash Chrono

304
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Trigger vibe. A lot of the music makes me think of Chrono Trigger. And I just, every time I play

305
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,560
it, I'm more and more impressed with the story, especially that weird pirate guy who's not really

306
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,360
a pirate. Okay. Yeah. I was going to say,

307
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
I want to play it at some point, and that's actually why I haven't been watching your

308
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
streams a lot, because I don't want to spoil myself. But for those that know they're not

309
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,880
going to get around to it anytime soon, it's a good way to check it out. All right.

310
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,320
Moving on, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?

311
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,280
So my gaming week was still Minecraft, still playing on the server, still editing video.

312
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,480
The second video is just about done. So I'm hoping to have that done tonight.

313
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,720
And then other exciting things coming soon in regards to streaming and stuff on there. So

314
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,280
I can't wait to talk about that once I once I can, once I have everything confirmed,

315
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:43,360
but extremely exciting stuff. So stay tuned for that. And then I finally got my labels for my

316
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,880
game cartridges for I saw on Twitter, they look great.

317
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,440
Yeah, they kind of screwed up the first ones. So they reprinted them for me. And they're

318
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,520
looking OK. They're looking pretty good. So I've only got enough for 12 because that's all the

319
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,480
cartridges I have right now. But, you know, eventually we'll make more. And I still have

320
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,480
to finish up. I had like two levels left I have to make for the game just to pad it out a bit more.

321
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,560
And then I think we'll be ready to go. So Dibs on buying one very soon. Yes, I know

322
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,520
lots of people want them. I don't know, like, if we should go to Kickstarter out just to do more.

323
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,920
But like or because I haven't really figured out how to do the fulfillment part of this.

324
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,920
You know, it's like, how do I take orders? How do I ship those orders? I mean, it's like.

325
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,560
So we'll see. I would say use your 12 to test this whole process. Have these 12 be for the people

326
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,080
that, you know, are closest to you and had the game. So basically, you know, me, Jamie,

327
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,160
YYR, Bobby, I guess because he's Bobby. Jason, if he wants one. Cool. You know, like the people that

328
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,600
probably drive and then use that as like your test thing and then do the Kickstarter to open

329
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,320
it up to others that might be interested in it. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. So. All right.

330
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,720
Anything else? I'm a little bit of Orna, just enough to get the rewards each day and doing

331
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,760
that stuff. I saw that we're starting someone's remembering to do the kingdom fights now. So

332
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,960
that's nice. We had a few of those. Anybody can start those now. I gave permissions to

333
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,320
everybody a while ago. Oh, OK. Well, perfect. I just did not use the bot in the discord,

334
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,720
although I don't know. I don't think we did last time either. So we'll see. All right. Yeah.

335
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,560
All right. Let's see my gaming week. So like my biggest thing is a story later in the show. I'm

336
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,080
sure you all know what I'm talking about, but I must sit and wait. So we'll talk about that a

337
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,760
little later. So I spent several hours doing that. But of course, I've been playing some of

338
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,960
the old favorites to is doing some Final Fantasy 14, leveling up my ninja, trying to get all of my

339
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,680
characters up to level 80 by the time the next expansion comes out. And now I know I have until

340
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:59,360
November. That's probably enough time for me to do it. So that's good. Also, your ninja look like

341
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,480
like the actual ninja, like for the earlier games. No, he kind of looks different. I mean,

342
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
also the ninjas have the daggers, which doesn't really match the look from the earlier games

343
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,520
a little bit. I can see where there's like some edge influence maybe, but it kind of looks a

344
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,920
little bit different. But I like I like the way the ninjas play in Final Fantasy. So I think I

345
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,280
have that warrior monk and I think one other one. I got to get to 80 and then everything is 80. And

346
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,200
that includes crafting and gathering classes, too. Do the ninjas still throw weapons?

347
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,640
Not really. They use ninjutsu is kind of like their thing. So you do a you do a bong bong bong,

348
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,880
you do like a three order and it goes by. And depending on what order you did things in,

349
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,560
you can do like an AOE attack. You do like a lightning bolt you do. But they do have mug and

350
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,880
they have something else that they can like a sneak attack, basically, like go behind and

351
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,160
get the mob that way. But they don't. They do have a throw dagger thing, but you don't use it

352
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,240
a lot in your rotation because it's not very powerful. But I'm thinking ninja from was it

353
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,640
like Final Fantasy six, but maybe I'm thinking like shadow because I think he could throw stuff.

354
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,720
But that's right. They had ninja in 11, too. I forgot about that. Yeah, didn't they? Yeah.

355
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah. Yeah. But it was very different. It's very different. I don't usually shout these out during

356
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,120
the show, but I just want to say Morissimo, thank you, because that's now 10 gift subs you've given

357
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,600
away this evening. So that is extremely generous of you. And I just want to say thank you. Thank

358
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,280
you for that. You don't have to, but it's very appreciated that you did. So thank you.

359
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,520
So let's see what else for my gaming week do I want to share? Oh, Dead by Daylight, I guess.

360
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,760
I hit rank 10 survivor, so I'm doing something right. But that's right about I think I've kind

361
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,960
of hit the peak of where I'm going until I learn how to loop killers better and get more talents.

362
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,120
I only have Dwight's talents and now I have Meg up to 34. So I have like one of hers,

363
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,800
but I don't I still need to get her talents. And then I got to work on the others that I

364
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,960
want their talents as well. So that's just like it's just a grind. You have to wait a long time.

365
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,600
I decided when I play, I'm actually going to go for David so I can just start off with Dead Hard.

366
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,160
Yeah. Yeah. That'll probably be the one I do next, honestly. And I bought the shirtless skin.

367
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,920
Um, Claudette, I can play daddy David. Claudette was going to be my next one. I was just going to

368
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,640
kind of go in order, but I actually don't think, I mean, she has self care, but a lot of, a lot of

369
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,200
the Dead by Daylight pros actually kind of taunts self care. It's not a great talent to take because

370
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,480
it's like, if you want to heal yourself, bring a med kit. So, you know, just take your, like your

371
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,480
challenge points and dump them in a character that you don't want to play that has perks that

372
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,520
you want. Like that, like what I'm doing with Bubba. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see. Um,

373
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,800
one last little thing not to distract. No, that's fine. I'm officially a plague main.

374
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,400
Okay. Work. Officially. I don't like playing as plague. I like plague, but she's hard to play

375
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,480
as for me. She's the Vombie Mommy. I know. I like her. I don't like playing her. There's a

376
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,080
difference. That's, that's for you. Go for it. I don't know if I have like a main yet. I love

377
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,840
Pyramid Head, but I feel like I do. Honestly, I do better as Freddy and Freddy's like the toxic

378
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,280
one that people, isn't that funny? Dark soccer, your power. Cause you were the one that bought

379
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
them for me the first time, but I honestly think Freddy's my best character. So you know what you

380
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,360
need to do then you need to level a Billy to get Tinker and throw that on Freddy and then everyone

381
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,360
will really hate you. Oh God. Yes. Yeah. No, I do. God mode Freddy right there. Yeah. I need to,

382
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,560
or I need to wait for, I need, I need that and pop. Well, you know, pop never shows up in the

383
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,240
archive. No, but I actually, I, I, I don't hate playing as clown. I, I get that, you know, for

384
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,000
folks with a phobia and stuff, it's, it's not a lot of fun, but I think his mechanics neat. Um,

385
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,120
so yeah, I actually want to play him. So like for him and doctor, because I hate what they look like,

386
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,680
they really set me off. I just bought different cosmetics for them. Yeah. I was actually just

387
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,080
about to suggest that I was going to say they have that giant chicken suit for clown. And that's

388
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,240
really funny to me. So I actually put like the ogre looking one on him, the big barbarian one.

389
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,480
And then on doctor, I did plague doctor. Cause I really don't like the new one either.

390
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,040
I played against a trapper today. I was survivor. I played against a trapper who was dressed like

391
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,360
Kratos from God of war. I didn't even know that was a thing. I was like, Oh, that was

392
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,840
like a trampus trapper as well. Oh, that's weird. I, but I, I hate going against trapper

393
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,360
hag. Uh, those are the two on my list. It's somewhat nurse. If the nurse is good,

394
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,200
the, the things with the, I, they, they all have jump scare mechanics and that's why I

395
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,600
hate going against them. I'm not sure about pulling up Dwight. I always think of his white

396
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,480
fruit and that would be an amazing survivor in that game. I'm telling you like that would be

397
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,320
actually Dwight is kind of like that Dwight. No, the survivor we need in dead, but last dead

398
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,800
by daylight tangent, and then I'm going to go into something else. The survivor we need the most

399
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,040
in dead by daylight. I will, I will hear no, no other candidates. This is the one we need the most

400
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,240
is Brenda from scary movie. That is the one we need the most. Well, we have ghost face,

401
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,520
you know, scary movie, scary movie was the, um, the Keenan Ivory Waynes, uh, one. And then that

402
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,800
the airplane guy, but it had a ghost face knockoff in it. It did. It did. But Brenda

403
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,920
was the best and her and Cindy need to be survivors. So it has been a while since we

404
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,280
did a list last, you know, I know, right. Maybe, maybe in the future. We'll see. We'll see.

405
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,480
All right. Um, survivors for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, let's see what else did my gaming week?

406
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,080
I I'm suddenly at a loss for what else? I thought there was something else I wanted to talk about,

407
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,000
but I forget. So, Oh, well, uh, we're going to get in. Did you talk about the game that's coming

408
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,480
back up later? No, cause I'm waiting for it to come up later. Okay. It's no man's sky. I played

409
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,640
a lot of still say you played it. I played it. I played it and we'll talk about why in a little

410
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,400
bit. Um, let's see, uh, some other quick little like housekeeping items to get into before we get

411
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,960
into, um, the stories for tonight. Number one, uh, we're not going to be here next week, Memorial

412
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Day weekend, because, um, I'm gonna keep it real. I was looking at the calendar of like the shows

413
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,760
and I was like, we haven't taken a night off since October when I took that trip to Idaho. Um, and

414
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
I, one of my friends is going to be in town in the Bay area. And I'm like, you know what? I think

415
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm just gonna take the weekend off. I want a night off. So I'm using some PTO, uh, next week.

416
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,040
And then when I talked to, I was like, Hey, Matt, Jamie, you guys can still do a show. And they were

417
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,640
like, night off sounds good. So, uh, a night off it is so, and you know what the reality is too.

418
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,160
I think just because so many people are getting vaccinated and have gotten vaccinated. Like if

419
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,960
you think about it, vaccination opened up to everybody, what, like April 15th. So that was

420
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,920
about six weeks ago. So most people that were on it right away, like I know Alan was one of them.

421
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,000
He now is hit his full VAX. And I think that's going to be a lot of people this Memorial Day

422
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,520
weekend. Um, so I think there's just going to be a lot of people that just want to go

423
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,080
do that weekend. Now, of course, I don't want to advocate like, Oh, don't it's, it's over,

424
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,640
be careless. No, no, I'm not trying to say that, but I think, you know, and obviously the CDC has

425
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,680
said, if you're vaccinated, there's a lot you can do. Uh, and I think it's time that people go do

426
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:35,120
them. Um, so, uh, I think dropping the mask mandate or something like that in June, in June,

427
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,840
and it won't apply to really big events, um, where like outdoor events, you'll still have to,

428
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,320
uh, either have proof of a test or a vaccination. Um, but anyway, but that varies state to state,

429
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,920
some states it's just, it doesn't matter anymore. Um, but, uh, yeah. So anyway, my point is,

430
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,360
uh, I I'm, I've got other plans next weekend and my inkling is a lot of you have plans next weekend

431
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,480
as well. Um, so we'll just take a week off. Maybe we'll do something. Maybe we'll do something

432
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,480
special during the stream or something. Um, well, I said many, not all. I'm actually thinking about

433
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,600
doing, um, a marathon stream. Go work, do it. Yeah. Hey, we'll see. Yeah. Um, but you know what,

434
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,880
as well, Jamie, if you just want to take a night off as well, sometimes it's just nice to have the

435
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,600
rest of relaxation. So don't feel obligated, you know? Yeah. I got 14 hours of that, Rob.

436
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,640
A lot of people in chat are just like, cool. We get it. Uh, SSU 100, Matt says, totally get it.

437
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,480
I took time off this weekend to see folks I haven't seen in a while. Um, and I, DGRMS says,

438
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,880
indeed. I spent the weekend with a friend of mine out of town at depth is bringing up the Pogo

439
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,800
special event, which did not play into my decision, but it is a nice perk. Um, I didn't know this.

440
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,280
See it to Beery with the random fact about scary movie. Apparently Lori Beth Denberg from all that

441
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,360
was approached for the cameo that eventually went to Marissa Jarrett Winokur from, I think

442
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,760
she's from hairspray. Um, I didn't know that. I love Lori Beth Denberg. I wish she'd done the

443
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,040
role, but I also respect if she, uh, you know, she wants to stay retired or whatever, whatever

444
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,600
she's doing. Um, the other big announcement, um, channel point reward streams here at VOG Network.

445
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,600
So Bobby did the last one. So Bobby did, uh, he just on like Thursday, maybe it was Wednesday.

446
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,720
What is time? Sorry. I can't remember. But earlier this week at VOG, he did, uh, a, uh,

447
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,240
stream where he looked at, uh, E3 tapes that he did in the year 2000. So it was kind of like old

448
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,640
tapes of what, and it was actually kind of neat because he had a game in there. It was like, I

449
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,680
think it was Simville or something. It was a game that was supposed to be like the Sims meets Sim

450
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,640
city. It actually never came out, but he had like 10 minutes worth of like filming the footage

451
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,800
because they were showing it at this E3. And I thought there was a lot of like neat stuff like

452
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
that in it. And I think that's kind of the fun part about going back and looking at old stuff.

453
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,400
It's not just like, Oh, what's the cringe wrestling event that I filmed. Cause there's

454
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,520
a lot of that too. But, uh, you know, what, what were like the things that never actually happened

455
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,320
or what were they, you know, looking like there that they didn't, uh, end up looking like actually.

456
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,600
So, um, that's kind of cool. What, Oh my God. See it. I'm sorry. This is a tangent,

457
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,040
but it's important. See it to be where he says that Lori Beth Demberg has a podcast.

458
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,720
What I'm going to subscribe to that one. Absolutely. All right. Um, let's see. So

459
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,960
what is the next channel point reward here at OLR? Um, I'm going to head this one up.

460
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,880
I threatened this one before I'm going to make good on it, but I'm only going to promise myself

461
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,840
participating in this. Cause I don't know if Jamie and Matt want to do it, but we're going to do an

462
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,840
episode one, listen through with commentary and talk about the old school days of the show. So

463
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,800
with rock, I'm down. What you said when I brought this up before you were, you were firmly in the

464
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,880
hell no column. Have you changed your mind on this? I'll do it. I mean, I hate listening to my

465
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,200
own voice, but I've had to go back and clip my own stream since no one will help me with it. Um, so

466
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:18,880
I'll do it low key. I had a migraine the whole episode. Sure. Oh, OMG. The value of this stream

467
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,640
just should have doubled how long it would be concerning. I think we had a lot of music breaks

468
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,720
in there. We did. So, so, you know, um, footnote, obviously I have to work around the music breaks

469
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,480
and things like that. So it's not going to be like uncut completely, but within reason,

470
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,080
we're going to listen to the whole thing. Um, and just talk about like the first episode is

471
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,520
there's a lot of stories about that first episode. Like where the hell did this show come from? Um,

472
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,320
why was it like a house party thing? There's like probably seven special guests on the first show.

473
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,480
Why was it like low key was one of them. Technically. Why was the show like that back

474
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,040
in the day? So there's a lot of good stories, um, from back in the day to talk about. So that's

475
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,120
going to be a channel point where we're, um, Bobby, if you have, I'm sorry, really important,

476
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,400
Bobby, if you haven't already activated it, you, ah, I was going to suggest he just activated. I

477
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,400
was going to say you may want to hold it because we're not going to be here next week. And so

478
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,520
that's going to be one less week. We can collect the, um, rewards. So Bobby, I leave it up to you

479
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
if you think we'll hit it. Uh, okay. Oh, Bobby says we can extend the time. Okay, perfect.

480
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,040
So we'll extend it an additional week for the week, but we're off. Perfect. Thank you. Thank

481
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,960
you. Sorry, Jamie. I cut you off, but that was very important because I want to make sure we

482
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,240
set a reasonable goal for the channel point donations here live. All right. You sure are.

483
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,560
So, um, my, um, I re I remember that cause, you know, I sometimes get that,

484
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:49,760
that visual memory in place. So I was on that blue armchair lazy boy or whatever it was

485
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,480
laying across it with a cheap headset on like one of my work headsets or something.

486
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,080
And there was a computer or TV right in front toward the middle. And on the other side was

487
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:12,160
the kitchen in that big vaulted room. Am I right? That's right. Your, your mic on the first episode

488
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,800
was shitty. Yeah. Cause I, all I had was that headset cause we didn't have another mic. But

489
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,400
the first episode of orange lounge radio and, and kind of what, one of the reasons why I'm like,

490
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,480
now is a good time to do it. We're coming up on our 19th anniversary. So around the time you guys

491
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,040
raised the channel, because Bobby said a high bar for this one, it's going to be 150,000 points,

492
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,920
but this is, it's going to be a good one. Um, the, the reason it's going to be timed right

493
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,600
around our 19th anniversary. And if you think about it, your 19th birthday means you're entering

494
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,560
your 20th year, right? And then your 20th birthday is the celebration of the 20th year, right? Your

495
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,600
first birthday is celebration of one year. So we are entering our 20th year of orange lounge radio.

496
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,680
So I think this is a really interesting way to look back and go like just how far we've come

497
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:07,120
because I'm not, it is no secret. Episode one is going to be really, really shitty. And that is why

498
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,360
Loki dark soccer, myself, we all kind of don't want to listen to it, but I also think it's a

499
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,680
really great thing to do to just go like, look how fucking far we've come and talk about some

500
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,480
of the things we've learned. Like these are the things in episode one that didn't work at all,

501
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
you know, and why we do the show differently now. So I actually think there's going to be

502
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,160
like a lot to learn from it and it'll be really cool. Um, and tiger claw points out also,

503
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,000
you've got to take into account the technology you had at the time wasn't as good as what we have

504
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,240
today. Uh, and that's very true. Another reason why the first episode of orange launch radio is

505
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:49,120
garbagey is because we were dial-up friendly radio on live 365. Remember 2002, not everybody

506
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,080
had, we had screaming fast DSL at our house. That's how we were able to do this radio.

507
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,560
You know what? You know what our 20th birthday is going to be? It's going to be, uh, uh,

508
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,800
Seijin Shiki, which, uh, turning 20 in Japan is the coming of age. Interesting.

509
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,360
Interesting. Yeah. I, I, I, I, I, I'm going to be completely and utterly honest. I,

510
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,920
I absolutely think OLR will make it to 20 years. I think at this point we kind of have an obligation

511
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,480
to get to our 20th birthday. I don't know how much further after that. I mean, but I,

512
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,400
but keep in mind before you all panic and go like, Oh my God, what is Rob saying?

513
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:36,080
We set this back like the second year of the show. Like if we actually hit episode 573,

514
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,560
we, we, we have no life. We're idiots. And now here we are on like episode 870,

515
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,440
but yeah. And Bobby says that in chat. Rob also said this at the 10th birthday and the 15th

516
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,080
birthday. So I'm saying it again. I don't know how we like the show will get to its 20th birthday.

517
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:00,240
Yes. Will it get to its 40th? I don't think it can. I just don't think it will be geriatric.

518
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,200
Uh, we will be, we really will be geriatric millennials or geriatric Gen X is the case.

519
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:13,040
Maybe, um, unless we hand the show off to other people, which is a distinct possibility. We've,

520
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,640
we've always joked for a long time. Loki's kid, uh, Julian and somebody else will volunteer,

521
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,960
uh, can do the show in the future. So anyway, but you know, you know what,

522
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,360
though, this is going to be kind of an observation and it's going to make me sound like a, you know,

523
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:40,720
a really old bitch, but I think that having this incentive to stay up with our current video game

524
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,760
culture, I don't know. I think it kind of keeps one young. Uh, absolutely it does. But then you

525
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,000
also like, you start to look at where video game culture is going sometimes and you're like, God,

526
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:59,200
like, you know, we did this. So, I mean, I, I, again, I don't want to like make everybody

527
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,640
and make anybody freak out or anything or like, Oh my God, is Rob announcing retirement? No, no,

528
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,760
no, no, no, no, no. But it is definitely one of those things. Like when she started to approach

529
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,080
20 years, you're like, how much longer are we really going to do this? You know? So we'll see.

530
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,760
And so we're recognized by Guinness. I guess so. Well, we haven't submitted to Guinness.

531
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,440
And I think, I think there's a part of that too, that like, we keep going because we are the

532
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,880
longest running show. If we stop, we're not that anymore. You know, and I can think of like three

533
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,600
other shows that can't wait to snatch the title, which, which they all worked hard and they've all

534
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,960
deserved it. But, and I honestly don't know who's the oldest, but, um, uh, yeah, but it's like,

535
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,560
if once we stopped doing it, we can't really claim that title anymore. So that's kinda,

536
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,400
you know, um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I know that's the case with me because kids in

537
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,720
the neighborhood talk about games and try to dumb it down for me as an adult. And then they

538
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,400
get surprised. Oh yeah. How do you do fellow kids? Like, yeah, totally. I get it double

539
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,720
for being, you know, mostly female, even though you're, you're a girl, you don't play games. Um,

540
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,360
I hope you know that it's now more than 50% of gamers out there are female or female identified.

541
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,160
I know, especially with like gen Z, if you will, or like the younger generation,

542
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,880
I thought it was kind of an accepted fact. Boys and girls both play games period. Like,

543
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,920
it's not like, it's just part of culture or period. Um, so it is fascinating that some

544
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,600
people still hold that archaic perspective, but it's, it's more, it's people our age that do,

545
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,800
which is unfortunate. Bobby was saying sadly though, since I don't play Fortnite or Warzone,

546
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,480
they're like, well, you're not really a gamer at my response to that. Well, I actually play good

547
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,480
games. Uh, my response to that would be like, all right, I'll listen here. You little shit.

548
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,720
We're going to, and that's exactly what I'm saying to that child. I actually am playing good games.

549
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:03,120
Listen here. You suck. Challenge that kid to a tournament on a, on the Atari 2,600 game of

550
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,840
your choice and watch them cry. You know, no, no, even better. Challenge them to mega man too.

551
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:17,120
Mm hmm. Or one of those or, or battle toads. Challenge them to battle toads. See,

552
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,960
see how well they do. Make them cry for saying what they said, Bobby.

553
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,640
Play through guardian legend on TGL mode. I'll wait.

554
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,720
Uh, let's see. Bobby Blackwell says a friend's nine year old started trash talking me about

555
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,720
smash brothers and his dad was like, oh, you know not what you're doing, sweet summer child.

556
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,280
Yeah. Yeah. Usually when I get teabagged by survivors and dead by daylight, I'm like,

557
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,840
they're a 13 year old. I know it. God, that makes me so angry.

558
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,960
And you know, it's funny. This is a big reason why I like playing plague.

559
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,160
It's because all I have to do is get the blood puke and chases them out immediately.

560
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,360
And then I get the extra blood points. Uh, let's get into some, uh, gaming news. Sorry.

561
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,320
We had quite the tangent there, but, and it was just basically old man,

562
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,120
and woman yell at cloud, but, um, you know, it is what it is. All right, let's move on to,

563
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,960
uh, what's going on in the gaming industry this week. Uh, big news about a big title, right?

564
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,720
Yeah. So Overwatch two, they've basically said that the new game is going to drop the team size

565
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,800
down from six players to five. And basically saying that the game has changed over time

566
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,200
and we've gone from having no hero limits to having a hero limit.

567
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,480
We introduced new roll lock over the course of the game. And we feel that this is the next step

568
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:48,080
to that Overwatch ought to be played. Um, so that's interesting. And then of course it has,

569
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:53,600
you know, folks wondering that are on these professional teams with six players,

570
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,400
you know, uh, am I going to be dropped from the team? So, um, yeah, it's interesting.

571
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,440
Obviously it's a bit early to see, you know, what's going to happen, but with the change to

572
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,320
five E five, um, there is a possibility that some of these players will be benched.

573
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Now I haven't played Overwatch in some time. Um, it is for those of you in chat, uh, over at

574
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,440
twitch.tv slash vog network that do play more Overwatch currently than I do. Is this like some

575
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,400
type of response to the fact that not enough people are playing tank? And so the cues are very

576
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,040
long for everybody except tank. Like, is this kind of why they're rebalancing it in this way?

577
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,960
Cause that was my first gut reaction because I do remember I was playing a little bit when

578
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,960
those roles first went live and yeah, like you were going to wait in a queue if you weren't a

579
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:45,200
tank period. So, uh, some folks in chat act def says, uh, kind of in chat. Okay. Good enough for

580
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,680
me. Uh, as showing her mat says, yeah, the five player match thing throws things off already

581
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,600
strategy wise. Well, it is a big change. It is certainly going to separate the sequel from the

582
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,600
original that's for sure. Yeah. So I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's the,

583
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,400
I don't think they really outlined what their exact reasoning was for that. Um, probably not

584
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,760
to anger people, but it's the change that they're making as of right now. Let's, you know, fan

585
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,400
backlash. And in which case they could go back on that, but it is what it is. It's interesting. Um,

586
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,000
because, uh, uh, well, the act-def in chat says they're rebalancing because tanks make it a bit

587
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,560
more complicated. I was gonna say it's interesting because that creative director guy, Jeff Kaplan,

588
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:32,080
right. Was his name. He just left overwatch not that long ago. Um, you know, again, I don't want

589
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,480
to be too like conspiracy theorist or whatever, but maybe there were some changes that were coming

590
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,080
that he didn't necessarily agree with that the team wanted to do. Uh, I don't know. I don't know.

591
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,800
I don't think it's related. I really don't, but it's, I'm sure I'm certain I'm not the first

592
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,760
person to wonder that out loud. So, Hmm. Well, I'll still, I'll still be curious about overwatch

593
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,400
too. That's for sure. I wish they'd unveil some more characters, um, and show a little bit more

594
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,240
of what the game's actually going to look like, but I guess it's still some time out. So, um,

595
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,320
you know, they're not releasing it this year. Uh, we're getting that Diablo two remaster this year

596
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,000
and that's about it from well, and then while classic, uh, burning crusade just happened.

597
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,600
Um, but that's about it or no is happening June 1st. My bad, uh, soon. Uh, but that's, uh, about

598
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:21,040
it from blizzard this year. So we have, uh, next year Diablo four, which I'm all about that one.

599
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,520
And then, uh, Overwatch two, hopefully to look forward to. So that'd be good. Um,

600
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,520
something else to look forward to that people have been asking for, for a long time here on Twitch

601
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:38,080
TV is new tags. Um, and I think we've talked about it before on this show. Uh, there's a lot of

602
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:45,120
people that have been wanting a trans tag for quite some time, uh, to, um, help, uh, trans people,

603
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:53,280
uh, find each other on the platform. Uh, granted, um, you know, one of the letters in LGBTQ is T um,

604
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:02,160
but I, I get it. It's not that tag is kind of dominated by a lot of, um, CIS white women and

605
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,640
CIS white gay men, like is kind of like what's, what's there. Uh, there's not a lot of other,

606
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,040
like, like it's, it's hard sometimes to find trans people within that tag. Um,

607
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,360
The other, the other one is allies using the LGBTQIA when the aid does not stand for ally.

608
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,640
Yes. I get it. So I know ally is getting their own tag.

609
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,600
Yes. That, that is one of the other, uh, 350 tags that is coming. And I also like that one,

610
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,520
you know, yeah, I, believe me, I totally agree. Allies should not be using that tag. I it's,

611
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,280
it's, I realized they have the best intentions. I don't know anybody. Well, okay. You're right.

612
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,680
There's always some people that are, but I, most people, and I'm willing to give most people the

613
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,120
benefit of the doubt, had good intentions using that tag for that reason. Um, but that's why,

614
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,120
you know, if you educate somebody and say, Hey, here's why you shouldn't, most people are going

615
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,200
to be pretty good and change it up. Um, but I think it's good that Twitch is coming in and just

616
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,480
making the tags a little bit more clear. So here's what's going on. Twitch is going to be

617
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,480
introducing 350 plus community tags. That's a lot of tags. And honestly, I couldn't even tell you

618
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,800
the entire list. I think it is linked somewhere, but I'm just, I'm kind of waiting for it to roll

619
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,080
out to see what happened. Uh, Twitch in a tweet earlier this week, Friday afternoon.

620
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,400
Said we had planned to share this next week, but we've heard a lot of you talking and we

621
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,920
want to make sure the record is clear next week. We'll be adding 350 plus new tags to

622
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,400
celebrate yourself and your community. And of course, trans. Well, probably came from

623
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,160
their blog posts about how they're having a dedicated, you know, a hot tub channel.

624
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
And people are like, well, wait a second. Why aren't you addressing this other thing?

625
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,160
You are one come in, save face. You are 100% correct. Because they went, I mean,

626
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,920
I guess technically we don't know what Twitch was doing, but we do know they put out a blog post

627
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,480
that was like, Hey, um, we're not going to ban hot tub streamers because they are quote unquote,

628
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,000
sexy. Like we're not banning someone for being conventionally attractive. Like that's getting

629
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,680
there in category, right? Exactly. They're getting their own category and you know what I cool.

630
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,960
I, I, I agree like Twitch is more than just gaming. And if that's what somebody wants to do,

631
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,840
and if that's what people want to watch, I myself will probably not be watching.

632
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,240
I certainly won't be creating that content. Well, maybe a future channel point reward. We'll see.

633
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,320
But for the most part, I don't plan to participate, but it doesn't affect me if it exists.

634
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,000
Right? Because that's the same thing that I'm saying about a lot of these other tags

635
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,760
is that it doesn't change. You know what? Let people have the tags they want

636
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,120
and identify how they want. It's not going to change your life whatsoever.

637
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,080
And that's kind of how I feel about the hot tub stuff at this point. Let them,

638
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,600
let them do their thing. Have fun. But by announcing that in their,

639
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,400
that they're getting their own category. Absolutely. Everybody responded and said,

640
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:06,640
Hey, Twitch, fuck you. Like we've been asking for a trans tag for over a year and hot tub streamers

641
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:14,640
get a tag, get a category first. And it kind of caused a subsequent call out to happen

642
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,480
where folks were saying, you know what? I bet Twitch is just sitting on this.

643
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,640
And here comes pride month, June 1st, they're going to say, Oh, look what we're doing for

644
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,120
pride. Cause we're the greatest company in the world. And here's your rainbow Twitch logo

645
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,880
and 350 tags that you've been asking for for the longest time. And you know what?

646
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,720
Those people with those comments were absolutely right. Clearly. And Twitch realized,

647
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,800
fuck, if we now announce this on June 1st, the start of pride month,

648
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,760
we're going to look super performative and that it's just a corporate thing and all this other

649
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,720
stuff. And so that's why they announced it Friday afternoon. And they said, we'd plan to announce

650
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,200
this next week. Well, what's next week, the weekend leading up to June 1st.

651
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,720
So it was performative. So yes, it was absolutely planned to be this,

652
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:14,480
but you know what? It's movement in the right direction. Yes. We can say about fucking time.

653
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,760
Yes. We can say you only did this because XYZ, but I think at the same time we have to go and we say,

654
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:26,240
but you did it. Thank you. The community asks for this. You're finally giving it to the community.

655
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,320
Thank you. Let's move forward and build a stronger community together now that we have what we've

656
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,920
been asking for. Let's look forward. And I think there's a lot of people kind of taking that

657
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:41,600
approach. So, let's see. They apparently worked with organizations like glad and able gamers to

658
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,320
develop these tags. Yes, that's true. Also says, you know what, Rob? I didn't think of that,

659
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,360
but I totally get it now. Lego kind of got some of that for the rainbow pride set they announced.

660
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,640
Yes. And that's kind of what it is. It's like, okay, cool. Everybody's gay in June. Awesome.

661
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,600
How are you the rest of the year? And this is what a lot of marginalized communities, again,

662
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,640
I'm not black. I'm not going to in any way try to speak for that community. But a lot of message

663
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:14,080
that I hear from folks is February. Yes, is, you know, Black History Month. But it would be really

664
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,920
great if we learned about black people 365 days a year. Like that should be a thing that we learn

665
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,400
about in schools and in curriculum. Juneteenth should be a thing that we learn about in schools

666
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:33,120
and not just like, oh, you know, February, right? And that is really be a nationally

667
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,720
recognized holiday. It is a very similar discussion when it comes to things like pride

668
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,040
is it's like, that's great, you know, and again, it's kind of like one of those I'm sure you have

669
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:50,160
good intentions. But how do you treat how did the policies of your company treat gay people,

670
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:56,000
trans people, and all sorts of marginalized people the rest of the time of the year? That's what this

671
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,920
boils down to. So, and deejirama S. responds, Rob, I feel this so hard in February. And

672
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,040
Bonsoblo6 says you hit the F a nail on the head, Rob. How are you the rest of the year?

673
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:15,520
Dark Tetsuya says Mishkin says thank you from over on the couch during playing Final Fantasy 14.

674
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:22,400
You're welcome, because I've learned a lot of this from you guys. And you want to go back to

675
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,320
20 years of Orange Lounge Radio. And even though I'm aging as faster and so forth, and what is

676
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:33,920
different between episode one and today? I've learned a lot of shit. I've learned a lot of shit.

677
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,200
And I think a lot of you guys have too. I think we've all learned from each other.

678
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,760
And that's one beautiful thing about all of this. So okay, anyhow, where was I? Oh, yes,

679
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:51,040
I was talking about the Twitch tags. What else do we have? We have I didn't talk. So I've been

680
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,600
talking about the trans tag, but it's important to notice. Note, the other tags are going to be

681
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:02,640
related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, mental health, and more.

682
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:10,240
Black, disabled, veteran, VTuber. I'm very sorry to show my ignorance here. I do not know what

683
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:17,280
VTuber virtual Youtubers virtual stream virtual avatar streamers. Oh, okay. I did not know what

684
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,960
that meant. Sorry. Okay. And they're going to remove references to Ally from that tag and

685
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:31,040
give allies their own tag as we were talking about before. I am of this mindset. I'm of this mindset

686
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:36,480
that like, if you are streaming on Twitch, you should be an ally in the first place.

687
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:43,600
And like people that aren't should be. And when I say ally, I don't mean just LG. I don't mean,

688
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:50,240
I mean the new flag that also has a decent human being. Yes, like that. And that's always the thing

689
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,520
that kind of got me about it is like, like Twitch should just like, if you can't treat people

690
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,720
different than you decently, I don't think you should be on this platform. Like, you know, go,

691
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,280
go start your own website. You shouldn't be on this one, but that's, I don't know. Maybe folks

692
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,240
think I'm a little bit too harsh with that, but I, you don't have to, you don't have to sit there

693
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:16,800
and scream gay rights on your stream. You don't have to do that, but like you can like not say

694
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:23,440
fag on your stream. You can not do that. But Rob, what the whole thing of having an ally tag though

695
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:33,040
has extra meaning for me as an asexual person. Oh, of course. Of course. We are a very overlooked

696
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:39,200
minority in the community. Um, a couple of the, um, the streamers that, you know, I'm pretty much

697
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:45,040
regular in their chats, like, uh, losing color puddings, um, naked prints, a few of them we've

698
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:51,280
actually, it's opened up that conversation in a few of, of those chats about, and there's people

699
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,280
in there who legit don't know that the aid does not stand for ally. I totally get it. Yeah. And

700
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:04,800
going in and educating people and having them be receptive to it has been amazing. You're right.

701
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,680
And I think I might be talking about a mindset that has existed on Twitch that will get better

702
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,840
maybe because of this and because it's going to be separated and so forth. And I would bet

703
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,920
I haven't looked, but with 350 tags, I have no choice but to assume a sexuality is going to be

704
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:29,360
a tag. Uh, I really do hope so. I can't confirm that, but yeah, I really do hope that it is if

705
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:34,240
transgender is going to have their own tag us ace folks need one too, or the, you know, the

706
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,680
non-binary community, um, tends to be also overlooked too, because people are so stuck in

707
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:45,520
this binary point of view. But, um, I mean, I'm also wondering since they were bringing up, um,

708
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:51,520
religious identity and nationality, if I'm going to see like a Jewish tag or a Muslim tag or

709
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:57,200
something like that, maybe, um, well, I guess we'll see. Uh, I don't know if they've published

710
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,800
the list. Um, but we'll find out next week. That's for sure. Peer to peer had Jewish as

711
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:09,040
an identity on there, which of course I put in right away. Um, cause I don't really find many

712
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:14,960
people who are outwardly, you know, public about their, about being Jewish on Twitch.

713
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,600
And I think that when you see that, you know, if you look past the stereotypes and see that,

714
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,480
we're all just like people that it would remove some of the stigma.

715
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,280
Um, uh, what else is it going to say with it? Oh, I was just gonna say, I'm glad that Twitch

716
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,480
is doing this. Um, I, I was always kind of like a little bit surprised, like, like I think if I

717
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,800
was kind of like in charge of Twitch, like how might I have done this? I might've had ways that

718
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:49,520
you can identify you, the streamer or your community and tags that play into this, you know,

719
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,600
honestly, the fact that I'm in my forties. And streaming on Twitch, I think is worthy of a tag

720
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,840
of some sort because, you know, we are, there's not a lot of folks in their forties that are

721
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,920
streaming on Twitch. There really isn't. I, and I, of course I would like to have a tag so that

722
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,680
people know I'm a gay guy that plays games and, and you know, other things that speak to me as

723
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,000
well. And I think, um, for like your community and for yourself and that, so you would have

724
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,680
tags for that that are kind of like permanent for your, well, not permanent. You can always

725
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,560
change them, but they're like account wide, if you will account wide tags. And then the streams

726
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:28,320
that you create have their own tags. So it's like, okay, I am the 40 something gay guy that is doing

727
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,880
a hot tub stream today, you know, or whatever it is. Or I am doing a retro stream where I guess,

728
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,800
cause hot tub is going to be a category now and people might say, Oh, it's you're talking.

729
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,840
Well, okay. No. Um, and today I'm doing a retro stream where you can ask me anything.

730
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,320
And, uh, I'm taking audience requests. Cause those are all things that are tags right now.

731
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:54,240
Like, and I, I would like to have separated things that way. You're you're like who you are versus

732
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,360
what is in this piece of content that you're making. Do you know where, do you know where

733
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:05,280
that idea is at? And it works pretty well. Pornhub and I'll leave it at that.

734
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,880
I've heard surprisingly progressive. I've I've heard.

735
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:21,440
I, I wouldn't know myself. All right. Anyhow. Okay. Uh, let's move on. Um, let's see. Uh,

736
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,120
it's my turn. Yes, it is. Sorry. I was just looking at comments in the chat, uh, because,

737
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,560
uh, pod culture is like old fart tag as she, 100 Matt says geriatric millennial tag. Sure. Even

738
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,160
though technically I'm Gen X. I'll add something about that. Um, and this is, and it's not like

739
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,280
a toot my own horn because yeah, I have good genes and take care of myself. But like when

740
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:48,160
I've been streaming, I'll legit have people who are surprised that I'm 45, but I take care of

741
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:57,280
myself and you know, I think that people are staying younger longer because we're realizing

742
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:05,040
that that attitude is, it's something that society has put on us that you have these expectations of

743
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:10,240
you. And I think our generation is one of the first ones to break from it, you know? Yeah.

744
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:19,200
And so, um, like I all the time, you know, we'll get, um, oh, well you can't have remembered that

745
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,520
or on the phone with my job, you know, I'll be like, oh yeah, my first computer was a Coleco

746
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:32,960
Adam. Like you can't, you can't have had that. Was it like third hand? I'm like, no, you know,

747
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,920
but I think that this is the thing that, you know, I'm not so sure that I'm down for the age

748
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:45,520
tag on there just because I don't really think it's relevant anymore except for the, the mental

749
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,880
aspect of it, their perspective that you give, I suppose. Um, and again, tags are always an opt

750
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,480
in thing, you know, just cause they have the tag doesn't mean you have to, you know, and there's

751
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,040
some, there are some folks within the trans community that would not like to use those tags

752
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,240
and that is completely a person's choice. Some people feel that if they use the tag,

753
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:09,680
they're going to be opening themselves to, um, people coming in to abuse the channel and be,

754
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:15,040
be shits online. Basically I completely get that. And if somebody doesn't want to use it for that

755
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:22,160
reason, um, I a hundred percent, 150% support it. Like you, I get it. However, I am also glad,

756
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:27,920
sorry, Jamie. I'm also very glad that Twitch said as a part of this statement, we understand,

757
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,960
and I don't have the exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, sorry, but basically like,

758
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,000
we understand the concern that these tags could open up channels to abuse and we want to make

759
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,800
clear this abuse is not acceptable on our platform and they are bannable offenses. That was my,

760
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,640
honestly, that part was the best part about this whole announcement to me is that they have made

761
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:54,080
it very clear. Harassment has no place on this platform. Good. It shouldn't. Sorry, Jamie. I cut

762
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,640
you off while I was ranting. I was just saying, you know, with the, the using the tags like that,

763
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:05,280
like me, I mean, technically as a demigirl, I have been told that I fall under the trans group,

764
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:14,480
but I don't use it because I don't, I just don't feel like it's representative of me. I'm

765
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,840
borderline, you know, it's, it's, it's so weird. And that is a hundred percent your call to make.

766
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,480
Exactly. Nobody makes that call but you. Exactly. Exactly. So, all right. So anyway,

767
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,200
um, I was using it as an example. I'm very curious to see what happens to some of these

768
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,680
other websites. Like the, um, I'm sorry, I forget. Is it the peer to peer? Was that the name of it?

769
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:41,200
The peer to peer? Yeah. That's the one that, uh, that I got accepted on. I'm kind of curious where,

770
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,400
where now that these tags are happening, does a site like that still kind of stick around for

771
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,320
the community they've built or are they going to evolve in some way? I'm just kind of curious.

772
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,640
Like, I think it's still necessary and I'll tell you why. Um, and actually when I was streaming

773
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:02,400
last week and I actually kind of fussed at them because I thought it was a bot. Um, but actually

774
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,880
they have people who work with peer to peer who are going in to channels and doing promotion for

775
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,080
those channels for different people in the peer to peer network. Oh, like this one was like called

776
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,840
like businessman something. And, and I was like, Oh, somebody blocked this. Like, no, no, I'm only

777
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,480
half a bot. I'm actually really a person here, but, and so we, we talked about it and they're

778
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:30,000
like, yeah, we're promoting people who are on peer to peer so that, um, we can, you know,

779
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,080
build up more of that acceptance and make sure that these people are given more of a voice.

780
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,080
And I was like, Oh, well, well fine. Hang around. I'm cool with that. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

781
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:45,760
You know, okay. So like the literal sense of network that makes perfect sense and

782
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,920
clearly answers my question, how that is still totally relevant. Thank you.

783
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,560
I found new streamers through peer to peer, just, you know, I've found games that I've,

784
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,360
you know, haven't heard of from watching peer to peer. Um, I've, I've really,

785
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,280
I've really been enjoying the service and I'm honestly proud to be a part of it.

786
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,040
Neat. No, that's great. And thank you for, um, explaining that because now that you put it in

787
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,600
that light where it's like literally not just about like being on a directory, but the active

788
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,560
promotion of people that also agree to those, you know, rules that identify in these different ways

789
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,400
that are also on the directory. It's about that mutual promotion and benefit. Um, Oh yes,

790
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:27,920
I a hundred percent get that. Hello, VOG network. We, we kind of have, we're, we're a form of that

791
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,960
for like a different thing, like indie voices and stuff. Right. So like when you put it in that,

792
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,360
uh, context, I'm like, Oh, okay. Oh, I guess so. It's like, it's like VOG, but this thing,

793
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,600
cool, neat. Well, and we may have some new VOG additions down the line, just saying,

794
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,280
well, we're still open to, you know, especially folks that want to do the Twitch thing. I mean,

795
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,360
yes, we have room for podcasters as well. Uh, and we have great shows that have been on our network

796
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,520
a long, long time that still do the audio only thing like British invaders. If you have never

797
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,840
heard me talk about them, they are a wonderful show that talk about British television and you

798
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,320
will find out about so many neat shows. You need to dig out of an archive and watch, uh,

799
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,320
that just like how we got from, you know, uh, old, uh, older shows in the fifties and sixties

800
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,240
to now and somewhere it's, it's great. Um, and then we have, of course, shows that are on video,

801
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,240
like us, Bobby anime jam session. Um, so yeah, my point was, um, we're always, you know, I've,

802
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:25,440
I've admittedly been very sleeping on a lot of this during the pandemic and some folks have even

803
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,400
reached out to me and I've just been kind of like, this whole thing has just been a lot.

804
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,080
And like, honestly, status quo right now is an achievement. If I can be perfectly honest

805
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,400
throughout this pandemic status quo has been an achievement, but now that we're getting to the

806
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:47,760
other side of things, I I'm definitely need to go back on the motivation side of things. So,

807
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,680
all right. Yeah. All right. Dark soccer. We've been teasing this next story, the entire show.

808
01:13:53,680 --> 01:14:02,160
So let's talk about it. All right. So, um, I, um, I have incentive to play no man's sky,

809
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,000
which for the record, it's not going to run on my back. I have to see if I can run it in my

810
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,120
virtualizer. Um, but at any rate, um, there's a crossover with no man's sky from mass effect.

811
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:20,480
And this lasts until the 31st. So time is indeed of the essence. Um, but basically you can do a,

812
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:31,760
uh, a mission that will let you, I guess, build the Normandy kind of, uh, acquire. Yes. You

813
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,360
basically call it, you, you call it the, as you play it, it, um, hints that there is like

814
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,320
something and there's very subtle hints through the whole thing where it's like, um, uh, something

815
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,800
that is called to action when it is most desperately needed. And as like mixed up with

816
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,280
radio interference and it says two worlds colliding coming together. So it's like hinting

817
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,120
that it's a crossover. And then when you finally finished the last thing and you put this beacon

818
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,440
out, it actually, it kind of like summons the Normandy into the orbit of the planet that you're

819
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,320
on. And you can go claim it for your own, um, your fleet. Would this be something I can do

820
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,840
as a new player? Yes, because they've put it in a new mode called expeditions, which is the mode.

821
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,560
That's kind of like Diablo seasons where you start a new game. It's the only way you can do it. You

822
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,240
start a new game, uh, in expeditions mode and expeditions mode sets you up with certain stuff

823
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:27,600
to begin with. So, um, and another hint, the very first thing that you do in this is you build a car

824
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:33,040
that looks a lot like the Mako. It's the very first thing you do, uh, and you drive to where

825
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,680
your ship is at basically. How long did it take you to do about five hours of gameplay?

826
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,120
So keep that in mind too. You're in, you do have to put in the time. Um, you're not going to be

827
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:50,800
able to just go in there and, uh. So I could get it done tonight after my stream. Yeah. So, um,

828
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,400
as long as I'm not, I'm actually right now seeing if I can put it on my, uh, on my windows desktop,

829
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:07,200
my virtual desktop. So, um, but, uh, let's hear it for gigabit ethernet, but, but anyway, um, it's,

830
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:12,080
it's, it looks like it's really cool. Um, now I guess I probably should have just had you do this

831
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,440
story, Rob, because you've actually done this, but, um, like do you get to go inside the Normandy?

832
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,480
Is it the same? No. So, and I think they did this purposely because they knew that people would want

833
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,080
to go inside it and do all this stuff. And I don't think no man's sky engine is really built

834
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:31,440
for that. You can't use it as your own ship because the ships in no man's sky are very

835
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,280
individualistic. They're tiny little flying pods, um, to suddenly have the Normandy and all of its

836
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,040
crew and all that stuff doesn't really gel with the lore. So what they did is they made the

837
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:47,360
Normandy a fleet ship and fleets go with your, uh, frigates and the missions that you send those

838
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,160
out on, uh, you acquire different fleet ships to send out emissions. So Normandy is basically

839
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,120
becomes like a, an agent that you send out to do separate missions and, and come back and bring

840
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,320
you stuff. But it is like, it's an S class. It's the very best type that you don't see, uh, every

841
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:08,800
day. So that's interesting. Yeah. Um, also, and it's also worth pointing out because a lot of the,

842
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:14,160
the tweet focused on the ship and everything, you actually unlock other stuff. So as you're doing

843
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:18,720
the missions and you know, you, you make your way, you start to see more and more of what you get.

844
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:24,640
And when you finish it all, you get titles, you get paragon, the paragon and the renegade. So

845
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:30,880
you unlock those titles. You actually get a sticker, uh, or like a, uh, uh, I forget what

846
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,240
they call them. Um, a logo, a splash, I don't know, but you get that, that you could put on

847
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:43,920
your base. So you get it and it just looks like the Normandy and you also get, um, something else

848
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,040
along those lines too, where it's like a art thing of the Normandy that you actually pick up and you

849
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:55,120
can use on your base. Now, are you stuck using this in your seasonal file? Because the expeditions

850
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,640
turn to regular games at the end of the expedition. Uh, and the answer is no, you're not limited to it.

851
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:06,880
So once you claim that, or once you've finished your season stuff, you can go back in your main

852
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,560
game and you're going to summon the space anomaly. That's the hub that you're able to summon a little

853
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,040
ways into the story in the main game, in the season game, you can get it right from the start.

854
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,480
Um, but you summon the space anomaly and in there is a vendor and he's the same one that had the

855
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,680
Twitch rewards from all those things during the first expedition. And you can, you talk to him and

856
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:32,880
he now has an expedition reward category and you can just pop the Normandy into your fleet from

857
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,280
there. Get your sticker, get your titles, get all that stuff that it gives you right off the bat.

858
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,440
That's pretty cool. Yeah. Well, um, well I'm going to see if it'll run in my virtualizer. Um,

859
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:51,120
but, uh, if not, I guess that's what my steam link is going to be for, for my, uh, my PC that I'm

860
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,240
still looking at with slight loathing because of how often it would just restart.

861
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,320
Bobby Black Wolf asks a great question in chat that I honestly don't know the answer to. And

862
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:09,120
that is, do we know if this goes cross platform, if you linked all your accounts? I don't know.

863
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,600
But if I remember after the show and you may need to nudge me with a tweet, I will log into my steam

864
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,960
account and check out my no man's sky file there. I think I can get the space anomaly in my steam

865
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,440
account. If not, I'll just fucking play it again until I can. And I'll answer that question. So

866
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,200
I'll try to do it, um, because I actually don't know. Um, and that's a great question. And I

867
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,760
doubt anyone listening currently is crazy enough to own that game on multiple platforms like I do,

868
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,600
although I did not buy the Xbox one. I'm using game pass to do it. I only have it on steam,

869
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,000
but, uh, I think it is a great question that you're asking. So, um, I will try to remember

870
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
to do that after the show, but you may need to nudge me if I don't respond because I forget

871
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,840
things. So, all right. But yeah, it's an awesome collaborate. So it's so random, but I just,

872
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,760
it's so short. I wish, I wish they would have given at least till mid June. I get that it

873
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,000
doesn't take as long to finish, but I think you have a lot of people that haven't been interested

874
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,960
in no man's sky that are suddenly like, Oh, I want to fly up and around. Cause the nice thing is

875
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,720
dark soccer. And this is right up your alley. When the Normandy is just floating there in space,

876
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:20,480
you can take your ship and you can fly all around it and underneath it and up close and over. You

877
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,680
can just like, you know, look at the Normandy from any direction you want. So that's awesome.

878
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:32,640
Yeah, it really is. I love, I love the Normandy. Yeah, me too. All right. Um, let's move on

879
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,000
Loki. Something, something exciting in your world and your fandoms, right? Uh, yeah, absolutely. So

880
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,800
deep silver. Um, I mean, there's been rumors that there's a new time splitters game being worked on

881
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,840
for a long time. In fact, there's been several iterations with different companies that happening,

882
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,760
but now we've got something official actually coming. Um, thanks to deep silver. So deep

883
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:03,120
silver put out a tweet, um, announcing that deep silver studio is coming, uh, free radical design.

884
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,760
So our new deep silver studio. And so they're bringing back free radical design, which actually

885
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:14,640
back in 2014, but they're bringing back the original like veterans, Steve Ellis and David

886
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:20,000
doke. And basically said, you've asked, we listen, we've been working on plans of bringing time

887
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,440
splitters franchise back to life and are pleased to let you know that we are doing just that,

888
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,400
uh, free radical designs is reforming and we'll be headed up by the industry and, uh,

889
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:36,480
time splitters veterans. Uh, this is exciting first step in the process. So I am super excited

890
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:43,840
about that. That is amazing. So I can't wait for a new time splitters game. I just, I hope they do

891
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,240
it justice for you, Loki. Cause sometimes they get the gang back together and it's like, Oh,

892
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,240
you know, there's not much to the formula really. I mean, it's a, it's an FPS with like weird quirky

893
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,840
stuff in it. And I think it, I think that's a pretty easy bar to hit. I just think about,

894
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,760
I think about things like mighty number nine and I know that game had its fans and you know,

895
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,200
I don't, I don't, but yeah, you see that that was my reaction to Loki.

896
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:13,120
No, I can, I see them being able to do it, especially if you have the original developers

897
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,040
on and stuff. I think it'd be fine. All right. Uh, orange right in chat says, I remember spending

898
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:24,080
some time in time splitters, one level editor, uh, as Joe and her to Matt says, we've been teased a

899
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,240
new time splitters game for awhile. I hope they pull it off. Yeah. I think that would be fun.

900
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,720
Uh, now that they've got it. Well, cause before like that was with like, we've had like kind of

901
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:39,520
work in progress things that were being made by either fans or being made by studios that have

902
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:46,240
clone or closed down and stuff like that. So now that they have a publisher, they have a studio,

903
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,640
I think we're, and they've said, yes, we're making it. Um, it's a pretty good indicator that

904
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:59,440
it's coming. Yeah. All right. Um, well, let's move on. Uh, it'll probably be too soon to see

905
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,680
details on the time splitter game this summer. Um, but we know we're going to be getting a lot

906
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:08,240
of game announcements, uh, as we get closer to summer, of course, E3 is on the horizon

907
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,800
and there are other virtual events that are happening as well, including summer game Fest

908
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,240
is coming back this year. And we knew that for some time now, summer game Fest last year,

909
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,080
I think people were kind of happy it was there, but it was also kind of hard to follow because

910
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,560
summer game Fest was like four months long. Remember that like, it was like summer game Fest

911
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,800
is running from June to September. And it was like, that isn't really a Fest, right? Well,

912
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,960
it does seem like Jeff Keeley, who of course is the brains behind all of this. You know him from

913
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,280
his game awards show and all that. It does seem he's picked up on a lot of that feedback because

914
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,960
he he's kind of saying in some tweets that he put out this week, the basically like,

915
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:48,960
I get the feedback that people like to have this information dump kind of like at one time. And

916
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,000
that, you know, uh, it's, it's going to be like a memorable month. He says, you know, this will be

917
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,640
a memorable month of announcements and updates. So what summer game Fest is going to be, they're

918
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:03,200
going to have a kickoff. They're calling it kickoff live. They're not saying what they're

919
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,920
kicking off, but it's kind of like a wink and a nod. It's an E3 kickoff, but not officially

920
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:14,400
because E3 soccer games. Yeah, no, not that kind of get off, but E3 is doing a kickoff. Oops. Nope.

921
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:19,520
No, they're not. As summer game Fest is doing a kickoff that may or may not be inspired by E3,

922
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,080
Thursday, June 10th. And it's at 11 AM Pacific time, which, so Bobby was talking before the show,

923
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:32,080
Oh, we might co-stream this. Hey, go, go for it if you're able to, but I will unfortunately be

924
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,280
busy with my day job. And that is not the greatest time for that. But I, but I also understand it's

925
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:43,680
in line with a lot of the E3 stuff, which tends to be during the day as well. 30 publishers are

926
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:49,520
taking place, or excuse me, we're taking part in summer game Fest. Some that are not with E3,

927
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:55,600
including PlayStation, Blizzard, Devolver Digital. So maybe we'll get more on that game. You were

928
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,720
just talking about it. Electronic Arts, who's doing their EA play live thing still. So that's

929
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:05,520
kind of cool. Also, I don't know why, but Weezer is performing at the kickoff. Well, that's fun.

930
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:13,120
I mean, Weezer's cool. Of course I look at the promo photo of Weezer and I go, Oh shit,

931
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:24,480
they got old. Oh shit. So did I. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. But sorry, I'm not being shady. I promise

932
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:31,280
Weezer's awesome. I'm just, you know, like, Oh shit, they got old. So did I. Apparently also

933
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,040
Jeff Keeley loves to do the co-stream stuff and allow that stuff, which I'm very thankful for.

934
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,200
And I think that's a great way to do it. You're allowed to co-stream. Apparently you can even

935
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,960
co-stream the musical performance because it's a live performance. So it shouldn't hit any of

936
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:48,960
those, whatever, but it has the rights to do all that. It shouldn't. It's true. It's true.

937
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:56,320
But it probably will. All right. So that'll be cool. I can't wait to, I mean, I can't co-stream

938
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:02,240
it, but I can work on a project while I have my earbuds in listening to it. I can do that.

939
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:08,240
So that'll be cool. And I, so I look forward to listening to it when, when it all goes down on

940
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:16,400
June 10th. So let's see. RHM087 in chat says, will the Twitch stream have to have generic rock?

941
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:22,400
Well, that depends on what you consider Weezer. When I read that comment at first,

942
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,080
I thought it said geriatric rock and I was like, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

943
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:32,160
It's not the Rolling Stones. Okay. It's not, it's not ACDC. Okay. It's,

944
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:38,400
and I'm sorry if you love those bands. They're great bands, but if Weezer got old,

945
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,560
have you seen Aerosmith lately? Like, really? All right. He's melted a bit.

946
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:54,480
All right. Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, I was on mute. I was gonna say,

947
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,360
look at the Rolling Stones. Keith Richards has to recycle his blood.

948
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:06,080
Oh, yeah. Right. Oh my gosh. And ACDEF says, I think RHM087 is talking about what happened

949
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:11,200
with Metallica at BlizzCon. You're right. I do remember that, how they replaced it with generic

950
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:17,760
rock. But let's remember, Metallica was at the forefront of screwing online music distribution.

951
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,720
I realized they've come a long way, but that is a flag they're going to have to carry for

952
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,280
forever, basically, what they did to Napster back in the day. You can't help but think about that.

953
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:37,280
I am confident enough that Jeff Keighley has thought of these sorts of questions

954
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:42,320
because he keeps tabs on things like when the Blizzard stream got muted and changed to the

955
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:47,360
generic rock. Like, Jeff Keighley, so I have confidence he's gotten all the contracts and

956
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:53,760
things that need to happen so that your Weezer songs don't get your stream a copyright strike,

957
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,320
which is great. There's a reason I make my own music.

958
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,040
Yeah, I know. And that's been a great thing, too, is that like copyright strike myself.

959
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:08,640
All right, let's move on. Funny they said that, but that's actually a legitimate strategy to get

960
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:16,160
past some of those copyright strikes in YouTube is a copyright strike yourself. That's so weird.

961
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,560
All right, let's move on. Dar soccer. You have a very interesting story here.

962
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:27,600
Yeah. So and this is kind of an important thing for me as someone who plays on things like stadia.

963
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:37,520
But Netflix, honestly, is now looking for an executive. This is a report to head an expansion

964
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:44,720
into video games. The report says that they've reached out to multiple veteran video game

965
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:49,600
industry executives for the position. And this is kind of going along with what some other

966
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:55,040
companies did. Like Apple Arcade came out with a bundle of games and then has been pretty consistent

967
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,440
with its updates. And, you know, we have stadia. We have Geforce Now. We've got those different

968
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,120
things. So it stands to reason that Netflix is going to want to get in on that action.

969
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:10,240
And I'm pretty sure they can make it profitable. And on top of that, you know, they've also

970
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:18,080
did interactive video stuff like the Black Mirror Bandersnatch and the Kimmy Schmidt episode.

971
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:25,360
And then they've also done series based off of video game properties. I mean, we had Castlevania.

972
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:30,960
We had The Witcher. But and they've also produced games. There were the Stranger Things games,

973
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,720
which, of course, they also licensed out Stranger Things to behavior for Dead by Daylight.

974
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:40,000
And the other thing, though, that's going on is that since Netflix subscriptions have slowed

975
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:48,480
down because of their production delays, that they've gone out and said in 2019 that their

976
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:58,480
biggest competition was Fortnite. So they're there. The fact that they would want to expand

977
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:07,920
into these other fields, especially for video game streaming, it really makes sense to me.

978
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,800
I think it would be a wise move on their part, although they've got other established

979
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,120
outlets, you know, that are already going to be a step ahead of them.

980
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,800
You know, it's interesting. You know, I know we're talking about kind of like literal games here that

981
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,280
Netflix might build into their game. But, you know, it's interesting. You know,

982
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,320
that Netflix might build in, you know, like literal games. And it would be interesting

983
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,240
to see how that's all delivered if it's through their app or how they how they get the game stuff

984
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:39,360
on all the televisions and stuff they support. But it's possible, probably with a very, you know,

985
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,640
like an Android, you know, type of base for all the games, it would probably work. But kind of

986
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,560
something you said there at the end made me think about like actual like video game streaming

987
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,960
content. And we talk a lot about how Twitch is really out here unopposed. I mean, yes,

988
01:30:52,960 --> 01:31:00,080
there's YouTube, but there's another one that went different. Yeah. Mixer that used to be

989
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:06,160
Beam back in the day. So, you know, wouldn't it be interesting if somebody like Netflix tried to

990
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,680
do like a Twitch thing, like maybe not necessarily letting anybody create content, although I'm all

991
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,840
about that. And I hope that is the direction a company that would choose to do that would do.

992
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,200
But what if a company like Netflix tried to woo some of these big game streamers with large

993
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:27,920
audiences to create content for Netflix? That would be wild. It would be like a ninja type

994
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,840
thing that's on Netflix. I hate to invoke him because he's always the person that people talk

995
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:37,600
about. But there's a reason for that. You know, his streams are huge. So it'll be interesting.

996
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:44,400
So it would. Yeah. But our HM 087 in chats is right now for me, Netflix's biggest competition

997
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:50,160
is YouTube. And there is that is because you and YouTube is basically free. You know, the ads.

998
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:58,000
I have a paid YouTube premium account. Yeah, I think there's a thing with Google phones,

999
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,160
too, where that like because I think Alan has like a premium account that he gets because he

1000
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,960
has an Android phone of some type. So I don't know how that works. But yeah, yeah, it's interesting.

1001
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:13,040
So. All right. Well, on top of that, now, I think that for Twitch streamers,

1002
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:19,360
I think once you make partner, you are allowed to stream to YouTube as well.

1003
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:27,440
Really? I don't know. I was reading something about doing multiple streaming. I mean, I only I

1004
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,720
don't plan on doing any YouTube streaming. It's just the thing is, is that with Stadia,

1005
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:35,040
it has an automatic ability to stream to your YouTube account if you want to.

1006
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a big thing they were selling in the beginning. Yeah.

1007
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:42,720
Yeah, which I don't want to do. Yeah. Interesting. All right. Well,

1008
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:49,760
let's move on, Loki. You're muted, by the way, Loki, we can't hear you, so.

1009
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:56,240
Sorry, kids are yelling. So this is pretty cool. We had a mod that's been made for Red Dead

1010
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:04,480
Redemption 2 to add VR support in the sense that they add basically a point of view with VR.

1011
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,560
They're still working out the controls and everything, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is a

1012
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:13,200
pretty gorgeous looking game as it is. So it makes for a very immersive experience.

1013
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:18,960
So this is coming actually by the guy that did the same thing, Luke Ross. He did the same thing

1014
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:25,600
for Grand Theft Auto five. And right now you can only run it on really high end hardware.

1015
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:32,160
They're saying that he's basically tested it on just the top of the line, you know,

1016
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:39,520
RTX 3080s and stuff. And it's still kind of not smooth yet, but it's still being worked on.

1017
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:48,400
But man, it looks pretty awesome. Like, I don't know that I would love to try that out someday,

1018
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:54,480
but I don't have the hardware to run that. So I always think it's weird. I always think it's

1019
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,960
weird when they inject VR into things that weren't really built for VR. But I also think like,

1020
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,600
let's say a game like No Man's Sky where the developers admittedly were the ones that kind

1021
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,600
of built that. They kind of made the game work well for it. I think No Man's Sky is a pleasant

1022
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,440
experience in VR. I wouldn't want to play the game 24 seven in that way or like all the time,

1023
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,000
but I thought when I did play it, I was like, damn, this looks good.

1024
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:19,200
It's been a long time since I played Red Dead Redemption 2, but I know like with Grand Theft

1025
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:23,040
Auto 5, they had the first person view that you could do. I can't remember if they had something

1026
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:27,840
similar that I am in Red Dead Redemption. If that's the case, then it'd be very easy to adapt

1027
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:34,960
it to VR because you already have like that kind of same camera already set up. Maybe they do. I

1028
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:41,600
can't remember because it's been, gosh, like over a year since I played the game. But yeah, I mean,

1029
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:48,560
it looks pretty, pretty awesome. So yeah, hopefully it'll be developed a little bit,

1030
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:53,120
you know, they'll work out the kinks with it and it'll be playable on something that's not so

1031
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:58,320
screaming cutting edge right now, or, well, just wait a little bit longer and eventually it'll be,

1032
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:03,760
you know, that won't be cutting edge anymore. So we'll have to wait and see.

1033
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,960
Something you're unable to acquire because of fucking scalpers, right?

1034
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,680
So, uh, well, right. And that, and the fact that I use a laptop, so I can't update that

1035
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:18,640
thing anyways. I got to buy a new one. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, moving on,

1036
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:24,480
we have a story that talks about the Evercade system, which, uh, I think, uh, this is cute.

1037
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:29,200
I kind of want one. Like we, we, uh, brought it up before and I'm kind of like, oh, it's another

1038
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,440
kind of retro thing. There's these, there's a lot of these out there. This is the one I was telling

1039
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:37,360
you. Well, we, we talked about it a little bit before, but this is the one also that had, um,

1040
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:42,080
some nest maker games on there. So they have several, uh, guys in the community that made

1041
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:46,800
games, have their games published on this, which is awesome. That is I'm open. Hey, you want to

1042
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:53,200
approach somebody? I got a phone. I'm waiting for it to ring. Well, um, right now, Loki,

1043
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,120
they're a little busy because they're going to be doing some, uh, some, uh, not, not Indy,

1044
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:01,760
but some other, uh, big publishers of the past, uh, doing some, uh, compilations there.

1045
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,840
They're gonna, um, be released on November 3rd, pre-order start May 28th. Uh, they're going to

1046
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:14,080
cost 20 bucks, uh, or a 15 euros, if you will, uh, they are compilation cartridges, which include

1047
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:21,760
Atari arcade one, uh, which has things like Pong warlords lunar Lander asteroids data East, uh,

1048
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:29,200
which has bad dudes versus dragon Ninja burger time, uh, lock and chase chase, uh, chain reaction.

1049
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:35,840
Um, Jaleco arcade with, uh, alligator hunt, snowboard championship, world rally, and then

1050
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,440
technos arcade, which has, uh, the combat tribes, uh, double dragon two and three. Um,

1051
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:48,000
Dr. John's adventure. Oh, mysterious stones, uh, minke monkey. Some games I haven't even honestly

1052
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,040
heard of to be real, but I love the idea of like these like super retro games in cartridges so

1053
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:57,120
that you're not like accumulating all these little mini players that play like five games. You have

1054
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:01,840
one mini player and a cartridges. That's kind of cool. It's like a legit way to do it. So that's,

1055
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:07,280
that's neat. Um, I, I, I'm kind of interested in one of these things and I haven't been for a long

1056
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,560
time, so well, remember they also have the full, uh, console version of this that's coming out.

1057
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,640
That's going to play. They have two cartridge slots though. For example, if you wanted to

1058
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:21,440
load up data East and you know, Atari or something like that, you can pop them both in and you have

1059
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,560
all those games you can choose from on there. Um, so you can just have a larger library and

1060
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,640
swap them out as you need to, but they also have the handheld version as well. It's available.

1061
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:36,960
Yeah. All right. Well, let's take a trip back down memory lane. It was a simpler to, Oh my gosh.

1062
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:41,360
Uh, I may have ruined it, but, um, well, you'll see it was the classic game of the week. Cause

1063
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:45,280
I hit the wrong button that actually showed the game. So maybe you recognize it, but if you didn't

1064
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,520
dark soccer is here to educate you on it. And I bet a lot of people didn't recognize that game.

1065
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,520
Cause this is, this is one that's for me, I, at least for me is a little bit more of a deep cut.

1066
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,920
I wouldn't have recognized it off that half a second clip. I just leaked through there.

1067
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,760
But dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,

1068
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,680
you guys should be checking this game out. Uh, dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1069
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,760
You're muted just FYI. I, I can't see your camera, but.

1070
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:17,600
Okay. Oh, there you are. Um, the game, the game is arrow fighters, um, which is also known as

1071
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:23,840
Sonic wings in Japan. It's a vertically scrolling shooter that came out in arcades. Um, in 1992,

1072
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:31,200
it was released by video system and it got ported over to the super Famicom in 1993.

1073
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:37,120
It was the first in this series, also a spiritual successor to a 1991 game called turbo force.

1074
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:42,560
It's a basic shooter. Um, you know, you have your normal weapons, you can upgrade your

1075
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:51,440
weapons with, uh, P items or rarer F items. Um, and then, uh, of course your maximum power level

1076
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:57,600
does have a hidden ammo count. Um, which of course, uh, after you use that up,

1077
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:04,480
you'll be reduced back to your previous power level. Uh, button two has a special attack. Um,

1078
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:13,200
and, uh, it really, the thing that made this a little bit more famous is that it had a cast

1079
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:20,080
of characters, which in 1992, wasn't really something that happened regularly in a shooting

1080
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:30,080
game. So, um, it had, uh, from the United States, its character was called blaster Keaton. Um,

1081
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:37,280
then player two was Keith Bishop. Um, then in Japan you had Hien and then Mao Mao for player two

1082
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,880
Sweden, you had Kofl, the Viking, and then TB 10. And then for UK, you had

1083
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:52,480
William Sid pride and Lord river and white and white. So yeah, you had your own characters,

1084
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:59,040
each of them with their own special, uh, special plane. Um, well, of course, you know that the,

1085
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,480
the two us ones, one was an FA 18 Hornet and the other was an F 14 Tomcat. Cause I mean,

1086
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:13,120
hello. Um, but anyway, um, this was considered, um, according to game machine in Japan, uh,

1087
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:18,480
the second most successful table arcade unit of the year. And it was the second most popular

1088
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:26,400
arcade game at the time. Um, it did come out on the SNES, as I mentioned, GamePro gave it a pretty

1089
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:32,160
negative review because it slowed down, uh, had slowed down issues in mediocre graphics and some,

1090
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:38,800
uh, sound effects issues. The music in it wasn't super great. Um, it did also get an emulated

1091
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:46,320
version in 2005 for PS2 for a, uh, Japan exclusive Oritachi Gessen Zoku series. Um,

1092
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:57,280
it had a number of sequels that came out. Um, so, uh, uh, it looks like that, um, the main,

1093
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:05,040
uh, designer Nakamura Shin, uh, did not like that they wanted to, uh, develop for Neo Geo

1094
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,960
and wanted to make more vertical games like that. Um, but couldn't do it for a horizontal monitor.

1095
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:18,640
So he formed, uh, Saikyo P S I K Y O, um, and did samurai ACEs for their first game.

1096
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:25,840
Anybody's heard of that. So, um, at video system, however, uh, they did Aero Fighters 2,

1097
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:30,880
Aero Fighters 3, both came out on Neo Geo. Sonic Wing Special, which was like a dream

1098
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:36,160
match version was recent Sega Saturn implementation. Special was also reaped,

1099
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:44,320
uh, into arcades as Sonic Wings Limited. And then, um, uh, Paradigm Entertainment developed

1100
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:50,800
Aero Fighters Assault for video system. Um, and so, uh, of course, Sonic Wings Special and Limited

1101
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:57,840
were both vertical monitor games. Um, Nakamura, um, who I mentioned earlier went on for Strikers

1102
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:09,920
1945 Plus for Neo Geo. Um, so, uh, a popular culture thing is that, uh, John Green, um,

1103
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:17,280
you know, who we know from mental floss, uh, and all that, um, in the Savannah airport mistakenly

1104
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:28,160
read it as nerdfighters. Um, and so they, uh, they had nerdfighters and nerdfighteria as a

1105
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:32,480
collective title for him and his brother's fan community. So I thought it was kind of funny.

1106
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:39,760
And then in 2013, uh, he was given an Aero Fighters arcade cabinet as a gift. Um, so the reason why

1107
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:49,280
I am bringing this up is that the, um, the SNES copy of this can go for some bucks. Um,

1108
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:58,240
on eBay on average for a boxed copy, I'm sorry, this one's an unboxed copy that has even been

1109
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:05,440
scratched in on it is going for 1200. I think I have this game though. I really do. I have to

1110
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:13,920
check. There's another one for 1700. Um, that is again, just, uh, just the cartridge. Um,

1111
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:21,120
I haven't seen what one in the box goes for. I'm pretty sure I own this game and it does look like

1112
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:30,000
there is now I am seeing one on another site though, that says new in the box,

1113
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:39,760
US version retail for 40 bucks. So I don't know if it's like a legit one, but who knows,

1114
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:48,960
but at any rate, um, you know, good luck. It is, uh, yeah, I don't know if this is legit. It

1115
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,760
doesn't, it looks a little bit too clean to be legit. So I'd have to double check, but yeah,

1116
01:43:53,760 --> 01:44:02,000
it is. Um, it's a game that's kind of hard to find. Wow. There you go. Yeah. I'm pretty sure

1117
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,040
this is a repro. All right. Well, is that it? That's the classic game of the week. That's

1118
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,240
the classic game of the week. I didn't have a lot to say about it, but I brought it up,

1119
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:17,600
um, as one that for some reason it's going for money. Yeah. Boy. Oh boy. Yeah. And you're going

1120
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,960
to have a lot of people checking their collections at home going, do I still have a cartridge?

1121
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,640
Cause some folks recognized it in chat. Uh, not, not just from the starting screen,

1122
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,840
but once you were talking a little more about it and we actually saw the gameplay, it was like,

1123
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,840
oh yeah, there's, I've played this. So, um, that would be interesting if any of our listeners

1124
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,800
happen to have this little gold mine sitting in their house. So good pick. Thank you. Thank you.

1125
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:43,520
All right. Classic game of the week. All right. Oh, I see that. Uh, Stella decided to join us.

1126
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,960
Loki's cat for those listening on the podcast picture. Uh, but Stella's decided to join us

1127
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:54,160
there during the break. Oh, she looks so comfortable. I love it. I hate it. She's

1128
01:44:54,160 --> 01:45:04,080
either comfortable or screaming. She has two moods. All right. Uh, well, I hate resting

1129
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:10,000
and possum. I hate to make you move. Loki cause Stella looks perfectly comfortable,

1130
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,920
but, uh, it's time for rapid fire news. All right. So as we were just talking about,

1131
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:22,560
um, red dead redemption two, it should be no surprise that we're getting granted thought of

1132
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:29,680
five on the Xbox series X and PlayStation five, three generations of consoles in the same stupid

1133
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:35,200
game. Um, I love grant the thought of five, but dude, come on. Like, and this is not coming out

1134
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:41,280
until November 11th. So that's, that's a long ways away. Like, can we please get something new,

1135
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,320
please? I don't really want to play grand theft auto online. I just want

1136
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:52,480
grand theft auto six, please. Can I have that please? Somebody put an interesting timeline

1137
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:58,480
out that really shows that like rock star hasn't done that much in the past few years.

1138
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,840
They're making so much money off of grant the federal online. I guess so.

1139
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:08,000
Yeah. It's crazy. Games, games take longer to make, especially huge AAA titles with 4k graphics

1140
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,680
and stuff. They're going to take longer to make. And I understand that. But when you like,

1141
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:15,440
really see like what the weight is like now versus what it used to be, it's like,

1142
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,200
where is grand auto six, but, but, but, uh, with that grant, that thought of five,

1143
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:28,720
I want to say came out. Um, well, it was, it's been several years. Um,

1144
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,680
was that 2015? No, that wasn't 25th, 2013. Yeah. It's been a while. It's been,

1145
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:43,440
it will be eight years in September. So I think that's enough time to develop a grand

1146
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,040
theft auto game considering that this one didn't take as long. Granted, they have gone through

1147
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:52,960
multiple systems, but I just think that they're making so much money on credit auto online that

1148
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,400
they just aren't really motivated to make another game. So, so if we're going to get a games that

1149
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:03,520
just won't stop being made, where's my Xbox series X version of Skyrim. I mean, I guess,

1150
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,560
I guess they have like the boost ups from the Xbox one X, you know, I guess there's that,

1151
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,600
but that's, I guess where's my, where's my, um, series X version of Skyrim.

1152
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:21,920
Um, soon I'm sure. Yeah. I think we'll see a remaster of Oblivion pretty soon.

1153
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:26,160
Oh, you do. Hmm. I think, I think Oblivion or, um,

1154
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,680
I don't know, maybe one of the fallout games. We haven't remastered for yet.

1155
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,480
Maybe they'll do a remaster of fallout four. Um, or, I mean, it'd be nice if they did new Vegas

1156
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:42,560
or something like that, but like, Oh, whatever. You know what? I don't care. You know, Skyrim

1157
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,720
though, like we give it crap because they keep re-releasing it, but that game is thoroughly

1158
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:52,640
enjoyable every time I play it. I have no complaints whatsoever with that. Like I will

1159
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:58,400
play that game a million times. Like it's no big deal. Uh, Zen monkey has a good, uh, comment in

1160
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:03,280
her chat here over at, uh, Twitch TV slash VOG network who says, I don't think rockstar is taking

1161
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:11,200
too long. I think consoles are just coming out too fast. Interesting. Yeah, I guess. And technically,

1162
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:16,000
I feel like it's been the same rate, but I also get, I think it's more like the demands of what

1163
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,640
the new consoles require. You know, if they want to make Grand Theft Auto six, a cutting edge,

1164
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,360
beautiful, it's going to be a 4k game. That's going to take longer to make, you know? Yeah,

1165
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:30,560
I guess I have to be patient and really I should probably give online another chance because they

1166
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:36,560
have a ton of content out there. Like it really is, but I, I'm kind of old school in the sense

1167
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:42,000
that I like, I like field expansions that they used to have, you know, with like single player

1168
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,400
storylines and stuff. I don't necessarily like the con. I don't like the, the having to pay for

1169
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:55,360
absolutely everything in Grand Theft Auto online, like buying stuff is fine, but paying to ensure

1170
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:02,800
my car, paying rent for my apartment, paying to, you know, recent, it's just, it's a lot of like

1171
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:08,560
grind that they purposely put in the game to make money. I just wish to get rid of it. Our chat room

1172
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:12,320
is pointing out that in two more years, uh, Grand Theft Auto five will be eligible for classic game

1173
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:18,160
of the week. Probably releasing yet another version of it. Rapid fire news. Whoops. Sorry,

1174
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,480
I think the cat wants to leave here. Oh, okay. That's fine. It's, it's Stella's world. We're

1175
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,480
just living in it. That's fine. I'm sure I was just going to sit here screaming at me.

1176
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,640
Yeah. Um, that's the listeners love it. They're like kitty, kitty, kitty. Yay.

1177
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:37,840
So it's a letter screen. Yeah. All right. Um, and then of course, uh, Last of Us two is getting an

1178
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,560
update on PlayStation five. They're going to be doing an enhancement patch to that, uh, kind of

1179
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:50,880
similar to what we see on Xbox series X, where they're upping the FPS from 30 to 60. So that's

1180
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:55,520
pretty awesome. And that'll be coming soon. Nice. All right. What do you have?

1181
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:05,600
Uh, you're also muted. I've only been muting myself because I have curry rice. That's fine.

1182
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:11,680
Not eating in the mic is a good thing. Well, right. But sometimes, you know,

1183
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:19,600
people got to eat. Um, so anyway, um, people have really, really, really, really, really

1184
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:24,640
wanted the mass effect three multiplayer to come back. Um, and we know it's not there in the

1185
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:32,320
legendary edition, but, um, uh, their project producer, Mac Walters in a CNET interview,

1186
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:40,160
um, basically said he would never say no to it coming back in some form. Um, he's quoted saying,

1187
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:44,320
we want to see what kind of reception the legendary edition gets and what demand for

1188
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:49,040
the multiplayer is. And then we'll ask ourselves if we have the resources, the time to bring it up

1189
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:55,920
to the quality level at fans one. So, uh, cool. I hope that happens. Make it cross-platform or

1190
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,960
don't bother. Right. In my opinion, I, my strong opinion, by the way, you'll notice, I didn't

1191
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,040
mention mass effect my game a week. I I've put the game after, after everything that I went through

1192
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,680
last week, my, my emotions on the show, I said, you know what I think is best right now. I'm just

1193
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,400
going to put that game on hold. Like it's, it's a timeless trilogy. I'll love it. When I play

1194
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:19,600
through it, I'll play through it in a couple months. Like once a lot of these patch issues

1195
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:24,160
and all that crap gets sorted out, then I'll play it, you know, I, why, why do I need to play it

1196
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:29,840
right? Right. Now, you know, I discovered mass effect as a trilogy late. I didn't discover it

1197
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,840
in 2007 when the first game came out or whatever it was, I discovered it way later. So you know

1198
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,120
what? Cool. Anyway, but I w I would be down with multiplayer, don't get me wrong. Uh, and I think

1199
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,360
it's the there's money in it for Bioware cause you know, they, they could charge for the packs

1200
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:50,720
and things like that and they'll get their money. Um, but we'll see. Yeah. So at any rate, um, now,

1201
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,920
and this is something I don't know that we brought up on this show, but it's definitely something

1202
01:51:53,920 --> 01:52:01,920
that's impacted a lot of, a lot of, uh, manga and video game fans is, uh, Miura Kentaro, who was the

1203
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:08,800
mangaka behind Berserk died at 54. And of course we know we've had a couple of Berserk games. There

1204
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:15,440
was the one on dream cast that came out in the U S uh, a while back called out. You, you've done

1205
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:20,800
one as classic game of the week way back when, but one of them you highlighted. Yeah. I know,

1206
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:26,640
but what, as I was saying, um, uh, it had BJ ward is one of the voice actors in it. And, uh,

1207
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:33,920
God, why can't Michael bell as guts? Um, so two Voltron voice actors. Um, but at any rate, um,

1208
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:40,800
because, uh, one of the final fantasy 14 classes, the dark knight was heavily influenced by the

1209
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:48,640
character of guts. Um, uh, in one of the servers, um, I'm trying to see what server it was.

1210
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:57,360
Um, uh, Balmung, um, in old doc, they had a bunch of dark nights, just standing

1211
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:02,320
in a row with their pose with the, with their ginormous sword over their shoulder.

1212
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:09,280
Um, to, uh, to pay tribute to his passing. Um, and the same thing was happening as some

1213
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:15,520
of the other servers as well, just different, similar vigils. Um, but yeah, the, since the

1214
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:21,680
dark knight was, you know, really inspired by guts, who then, um, of course, Mira had a lot

1215
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:27,040
to do with that. Of course, his mark has shown up in many other character classes and games.

1216
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:33,920
So, uh, and you know, the other sad thing for me is that this means berserk is never going to,

1217
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:43,680
to have an ending. It actually, the last arc left off in berserk that I was reading had Casca

1218
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:51,680
getting her, uh, her, uh, personality and memory back, but with a big, uh, hitch in her relationship

1219
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:57,600
with guts. So I don't know if we're ever going to see that end if he's left any kind of successor.

1220
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:04,160
So I don't know what'll happen. Um, Balmung, by the way, I think is probably still the biggest

1221
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:08,000
Final Fantasy 14 server. There's like a ton of people that are on it. A lot of role-play stuff

1222
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,280
that happens there. So I'm kind of not surprised that this, uh, happened on that server. So,

1223
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:18,960
all right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and talk about some

1224
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,080
games that are coming out this week. We'll start in the U S Loki.

1225
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:27,600
All right. So we have bio mutant on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC,

1226
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:36,320
Capcom arcade stadium on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, final fantasy 14 on

Xbox one and Xbox series X super Bomberman are online on PC into the switch and PlayStation four

1235
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:36,800
tente Boku Metsu on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

1236
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:43,440
Warhammer age of Sigmar storm ground on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1237
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:51,760
And let's see song of horror PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, the world world's end club

1239
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:03,840
four. That's a busy week, but also, um, probably with the summer on the horizon, a lot of folks

1240
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,720
getting out of school and stuff. It's a, it's usually, usually this week before summer, so to

1241
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:14,000
speak is a huge release window. So I'm not too surprised. Um, quite a few things coming out in

1242
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,120
Japan as well, maybe not quite as crowded, but still, uh, on the Nintendo switch paradigm paradox,

1243
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:25,360
uh, comes out on may 27th, as well as a limited edition for that, uh, tente Boku Metsu comes out

1244
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:30,320
as well. Uh, world's end club gets a release and it's in English. Um, but that is still being

1245
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:35,360
released in Japan. Uh, so you have that to look forward to as well as liberated, same thing going

1246
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:39,760
on there. Uh, you also have man eater gets it's released in Japan this week. That is also on the

1247
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,280
switch heading over to the PlayStation five. Uh, they'll say just one game Terminator resistance

1248
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:51,040
enhanced. So there's that on the PlayStation five and for the PlayStation four this week,

1249
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:57,280
uh, you have, uh, tente Boku Metsu is out there as well. Uh, the last of us two gets a price

1250
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:02,560
reduction, uh, on PlayStation four this week. Biomutant is out this week as well in Japan.

1251
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,560
And, um, I think that is about it. How about the UK dark soccer?

1252
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:13,840
We have a few things on the 25th. We have Shin Megami Tensei three Nocturne HD remaster.

1253
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:21,440
Um, also in the 25th, we have man-eater for switch, um, Biomutant for PlayStation, Xbox,

1254
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:29,520
and, uh, PC. On the 27th, we have Asterix and Obelix, the XXL collection, um, for PlayStation

1255
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:35,120
and switch on the 28th, we have instant sports tennis for switch and also for the switch port

1256
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:43,920
Royale four. All right. That's it. Then we'll move on to some more stories. Uh, Loki, I think

1257
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:50,000
you have our next story. Yeah. So we had, I think it was last week, Sony saying that they weren't

1258
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,080
sure they're going to be able to meet the demand with PlayStation five. And you know,

1259
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:01,200
Nintendo's like, Hey, hold my beer. Um, they're basically saying that they're also uncertain that

1260
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:08,800
they're going to meet the insane demand of the Nintendo switch. Um, so apparently, you know,

1261
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:14,080
they've sold a lot and the demand is still too high. Uh, right now they said they have ads for

1262
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:18,320
production. We've achieved steady hardware production through the end of the last calendar

1263
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:23,280
year. And as a result in the previous fiscal year, we set a record of our highest fourth quarter

1264
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,880
sales volume. Meanwhile, the demand for hardware continues to exceed our expectations. Even the

1265
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,600
beginning of this calendar year and production has currently not caught up to this high demand

1266
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:40,560
due to tight supply and demand for semiconductor materials worldwide. So they're, they're trying,

1267
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:51,120
but you know, the shortages they're affecting everyone. Um, gosh, there's, uh, um,

1268
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,480
there's just a bunch of shortages that they're still expecting through this year. Like with the

1269
01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:01,120
whole PlayStation five, I think the graphics card things come out like this with all these, you know,

1270
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,000
microchips and things, and just a lot of the stuff, you know, cause, and, and COVID honestly,

1271
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,240
because even though COVID is in one kind of place here in the U S that's not what the rest of the

1272
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:15,200
world looks like. So there's that as well. And, um, yeah, it's just, uh, it's not going to be a

1273
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:19,680
pretty year for a lot of those holiday things. So, uh, you know, like I said, I don't, I still

1274
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:24,320
don't have a PlayStation five. I don't know if I'm going to get one this year because of all this

1275
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,160
otherwise around the winter time, I might be interested in getting one, but I just don't see

1276
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:35,520
it actually happening sadly. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, well moving on and, um, speaking of,

1277
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:41,520
uh, you know, um, the reality that COVID is still, still alive and well in the U S as well as many

1278
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:48,720
parts, many parts of the world. Um, a lot of folks have noticed, uh, uh, Diego, uh, who is a, uh,

1279
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:53,920
fighting game professional gamer. He's pretty well known in those, uh, communities, um,

1280
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,960
has just been released from the hospital, uh, in a tweet, uh, on his account, Diego, the beast,

1281
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,520
he wrote after nearly two weeks of treatment today, I was released from the hospital,

1282
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:08,480
extremely grateful to the nurses and doctors for their devoted care, many thanks to my fans and

1283
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:13,040
colleagues for the warm support. It will take time to get back to normal, but I'm so glad I'm

1284
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:18,960
recovering. So, uh, it sounds like, uh, from what I was picking up on, um, he actually got like a

1285
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:25,200
pneumonia as a result of COVID. And that is a very, um, scary situation. Um, I had a friend

1286
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:29,520
many years ago and some of you might remember this on the show. Uh, she had swine flu and got

1287
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:34,880
pneumonia as a result of that and she passed away. Uh, and she was only 24 and that was horrible.

1288
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,000
My friend actually is still in the hospital and still on a ventilator. Oh no, I'm sorry to hear

1289
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,400
that. Every time she's more responsive and every time they've tried to take her off the ventilator,

1290
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:51,040
she's suffered for it. So she's still on. Um, but she went in with pneumonia and had COVID as a

1291
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:57,840
result. Um, and she also had some kidney problems that were really highly exacerbated by it. So

1292
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:05,120
she's been on dialysis. Oh my gosh. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm afraid

1293
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:10,480
for her, whether she recovers or not, she's going to be wheelchair bound after this.

1294
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:15,440
Yeah. Oh gosh. Well, still sending my thoughts, um, her way and hoping, um,

1295
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:20,560
all can go as well as possible in this situation. So, uh, everyone just send KK to your love.

1296
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:27,360
Um, now act-def talking about Daigo and the tweet that I was reading here, uh, we owe a lot,

1297
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:32,800
uh, to Daigo on fighting games and competitive games getting mainstream. Um, and, um, yeah,

1298
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,200
I mean, it's, it's, you know, to hear that this is still going on and, you know, to people that we,

1299
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:42,880
you know, follow respect admire, it's just kind of a reminder. So even though, yes, you know,

1300
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,040
vaccines are doing some amazing stuff here in the States. And I think, you know, I mentioned,

1301
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:50,320
we're taking next week off and I think a lot of people are going to be kind of celebrating over

1302
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:55,600
the long weekend. I think it's still a reminder. You got to still take some sense of precaution,

1303
02:01:55,600 --> 02:02:00,720
especially if you're not vaccinated, if you're not vaccinated, um, you really owe it to other

1304
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:05,920
people to still protect, uh, people from potentially getting the virus, you know? So,

1305
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,320
um, you know, take precautions and let stories like this be a warning. You don't want this to be

1306
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:16,880
you. So, because it never happens to you until it does. And then why did it happen to me? Anyway,

1307
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,600
all right, moving on. Uh, we have another story, which I think is Dark Sakura's.

1308
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:30,400
Let me unmute now that I have taken a sip, um, or taken a bite. So this is kind of cool. There

1309
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:42,880
is an old school Xbox Easter egg that people have found after 20 years. Um, so, uh, basically, um,

1310
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:47,600
well, and it actually, it was disclosed by the developer, um, one of the developers who worked

1311
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:55,360
on the Xbox, um, basically because it had never been found, he said how to do it. So you'll need

1312
02:02:55,360 --> 02:03:03,120
to, uh, rip a CD to your Xbox hardware. And when you're prompted to name the album, you type in

1313
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:11,760
Timmy with 26 Y's and an exclamation point. It's pronounced Timmy. It is, but I am

1314
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:21,200
spelling it out anyway. Um, what happens after that is that, um,

1315
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:29,760
it will show you a different credit screen, uh, in the system information option, uh, that will,

1316
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:37,360
uh, list members of the Xbox dashboard team. So that's pretty cool. They, um, also in response

1317
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:42,640
to this Seamus Blackley, who is also an amazing Baker extraordinaire, and I have learned a lot

1318
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:50,160
from him, um, has, uh, actually reached out and told Kotaku that he wasn't aware of the

1319
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:56,080
that he wasn't aware of that Easter egg, but he says there's at least one last surprise the Xbox

1320
02:03:56,080 --> 02:04:02,720
fans have not found, and he's not going to tell you how to trigger it. Oh, good luck.

1321
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:10,160
Yeah. Has anyone, has anyone tried entering Cartman in the disc ripping stream? Uh, which

1322
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:14,880
I totally forgot the Xbox would rip, uh, audio discs. I totally forgot that that was the thing

1323
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:19,040
until I was seeing the story myself and I was like, oh yeah, that was the thing you could do.

1324
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:25,200
Like, I think I, I think I ripped the Echo image album from back in the day, uh, you know,

1325
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:29,280
DDR and all that stuff. I think I ripped that to my original Xbox because you could, you could play

1326
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:35,920
games with music like that was ripped to the, um, uh, system. It's kind of neat. So anyway,

1327
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:40,080
that's cute that we're finding all these Easter eggs. What, literally 20 years later as, uh, you

1328
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:46,080
know, Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox. So it's kind of fun for sure. That's pretty cool.

1329
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:52,560
Meanwhile, on the Sony front, what do we have Loki? Some weird stuff, you know? Uh, so the,

1330
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:59,040
apparently back when Epic was testing the Unreal three engine on the PlayStation three,

1331
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:06,640
they had built some kind of proof of concepts to basically, um, test out the engine on the hardware

1332
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:14,480
and some of the things that they did were port, um, I unreal over to the PlayStation three. And

1333
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:20,720
also they also have a version of gears of war three that runs on the PlayStation three.

1334
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:28,320
And well, thanks to a digital archivist, uh, by the name of pixel butts, he has decided to, uh,

1335
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:37,360
release the, the demo, um, out to the internet archives. And, um, now you're not necessarily

1336
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:41,760
going to be able to run this on PlayStation three hardware only runs on a dev unit, but I think

1337
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:48,320
through emulation, you might be able to do some of it. Um, right now though, or you could just

1338
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:55,680
get it on your Xbox. It's literally the same game. Right. But it, it's forbidden now to play it on a

1339
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,000
PlayStation three. So you're doing something you're not supposed to do. Yeah. Right. So

1340
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:06,320
apparently though, it's not optimized obviously. And, um, it does have several caveats to get it

1341
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:14,400
run. Uh, the emulator only can reach the title screen, but, um, I guess if you happen to own

1342
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:19,760
a dev piece of hardware for PlayStation three, you can see a title screen. No, no, no. You can

1343
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:24,480
actually play the game. Oh, okay. Emulator can only get to the, Oh, got it. Got it. Got it. Okay.

1344
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:31,040
Yeah. So neat. Although not when you put it in the context of Epic was testing the unreal engine on

1345
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:34,400
PlayStation and this is what they used to do it. It's actually kind of like, Oh, okay. Well that

1346
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:38,800
actually totally makes sense. Even if this game that they were making was, uh, you know,

1347
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:46,720
an exclusive to Microsoft. So, uh, interesting. All right. Uh, less interesting and actually

1348
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:51,760
kind of pissing some people off has to do with a new Amiibo that's coming out for Zelda Skyward

1349
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:56,640
sword. Uh, and of course, Skyward sword HD is coming out what in July? And there's going to

1350
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:02,480
be a new Amiibo that comes with it, a Zelda and loft wing Amiibo. And, uh, it's putting a feature

1351
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:07,840
in this Amiibo. So it's not unheard of that like Amiibos do like interesting weird things in the

1352
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:13,600
game, but this one's almost a little bit more because it actually allows you to zip between the

1353
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:19,600
games airborne overworld and Hyrule surface, uh, which was not something that was available in the

1354
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:25,440
original game. Um, it's a time saver. So, you know, uh, we've been talking a little bit about

1355
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:31,200
summer games done quick and, uh, you know, Bobby's very involved with that and has been, uh, promoting

1356
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:38,080
that coming up in a few weeks. This could do a lot for speed running, but it's an Amiibo and it's

1357
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:43,600
something that you have to buy. Basically not only is it an Amiibo only functionality, by the way,

1358
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:50,720
this Amiibo is $10 more than your normal Amiibo. It's $25, not 15. Well, I mean, it's not the first

1359
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:56,000
time that Nintendo's put out a more expensive Amiibo because like, uh, that giant Yoshi egg,

1360
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:03,440
Yoshi yarn thing, that was like a $40 Amiibo, but it was a giant one. I mean, this one, I think it's

1361
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,960
a little bigger and it's a little more detailed, but still, I mean, you can't help, but kind of

1362
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:12,000
raise your eyebrow at what's going on. Oh, and by the way, they wonder why people pirate those

1363
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:19,280
Amiibos then. Yes. And by the way, because this sold out, this, uh, the feature, this more, they

1364
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:27,840
sold out instantly, uh, gone in the UK, the U S you name it, scalpers bought them up. So, um, yeah,

1365
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:36,480
I, uh, I, I want to, you know, as much as I do not like to endorse piracy here on the show, I think

1366
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:41,520
this is one of those situations where we need to remind people, uh, it is possible to make your own

1367
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:49,840
Amiibo, uh, not saying you can make it with the, um, the, um, uh, figure and all that stuff, but you

1368
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:54,640
can actually, if you want to unlock this feature, there is a way you can do that. Look, you know a

1369
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:58,480
little bit more about this, right? It's like, you can actually create your own ARFID tags and all

1370
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:04,240
this stuff, right? Yeah. So you, you basically, you buy these tags that are like on Amazon or eBay or

1371
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:10,560
whatever you just buy the specific, um, RFID tags. And then what they normally do is they will store

1372
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:16,400
them in like, it's like a sticker almost. And then people will buy like, um, they're like coin

1373
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:21,440
collector cases. And so it's like a little coin and you basically print out artwork for it and

1374
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:26,000
stuff and stick the sticker on there or like poker chips or something like that. So something small,

1375
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,040
but basically it's a sticker and there's people online that will read, or you can actually read

1376
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:36,320
your own Amiibo, um, using just like an Android phone and there's an app, an APA APK you can

1377
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:41,840
download to it that you can run and basically copy or download Amiibos to these tags.

1378
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:46,160
Have a whole binder of these. Yeah. You can have like, you know, basically

1379
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:53,200
50 tags, I think are like 20 bucks. I have all these animal crossing cards too.

1380
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:58,640
Yeah. So it's, it's basically, it's like that in a lot of people leak them online,

1381
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:02,720
especially if it's something hard to find like this, it'll be online. It'll be online

1382
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:08,400
immediately. And so you can just, you know, download it. And then eventually if you stop

1383
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:12,800
playing, you know, this game, then you can download another one to it.

1384
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:18,080
And again, this isn't a topic I enjoy discussing here on OLR, but when they put these kinds of

1385
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:23,600
features away in the game and scalpers end up getting everything, um, and that's the person

1386
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:27,040
that's going to get hurt. I don't think Nintendo is going to get hurt as much by this as scalpers

1387
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,040
will because, Hey, Nintendo sold all their inventory, but the gamers would like to still

1388
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:36,080
be able to, uh, have the feature. So as far as I'm concerned, fuck them. And I mean, scalpers,

1389
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:41,520
fuck them. Like, you know, okay. Thanks for giving Nintendo money so we can have a feature.

1390
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:46,560
I guess, although I'm not the biggest fan of the implementation, don't get me wrong.

1391
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:50,640
But at the same time, if these amiibo were more readily available, I probably wouldn't be having

1392
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:54,240
this discussion right now. We'd probably be having more of a discussion about, well, should they be

1393
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:57,760
charging so much money? Shouldn't they have other ways to unlock this feature and so forth. But,

1394
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:05,600
um, as far as I'm concerned, uh, make your own amiibo. Who cares? So, yeah. All right. Anyhow,

1395
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:10,960
let's move on and get to the listener round table. And this is the part where we, uh,

1396
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:16,000
get you guys involved with the show, uh, via, um, your emails and any chat questions you might have

1397
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,560
over at twitch.tv slash vog network. And, uh, we'll get some of your discord comments as well.

1398
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,400
There's some good stuff throughout the week this week. So, uh, we have some emails, I think

1399
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:28,800
tonight though. So we'll start with dark soccer and, uh, participate at orange laundry.com.

1400
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:35,600
If you want to send an email for a future week. We do. So, uh, first email comes from Robert M.

1401
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:41,440
I would love to see the enhanced me editing features in Miitopia for the switch patched

1402
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:47,600
into smash ultimate and use for later games that use me such as Mario golf, super rush.

1403
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,440
Would this be a good idea or bad idea? It's an idea.

1404
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:55,600
Why not? Um, I, you know, thank you for reminding us that Miitopia came out this

1405
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:59,600
week cause I plum forgot. Um, but I know Bobby was talking a little bit about it on his show

1406
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:04,000
tonight. I guess they have a very robust demo that came out for it. Um, so maybe I'll check that out

1407
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,080
at some point. Um, but yeah, why I think people love to have fun with those means, of course,

1408
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:11,760
they love to make, um, you know, celebrities and things they shouldn't be making in there and,

1409
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,000
and, you know, scandalous things. But I think it just kind of shows that people,

1410
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,160
people have fun flexing their creative muscles with this stuff. Why shouldn't we put it in some

1411
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:25,280
of the other games like smash brothers and stuff? I think it's fun. Um, so yeah, why not? But I will

1412
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:31,120
Nintendo do it. I, although, you know, with as much shit as we give Nintendo, like in that last

1413
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:36,320
story, I will say Nintendo is very good at supporting their products long after launch.

1414
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:41,840
Um, and you know, putting out DLC literally years after the fact or something like the Mario party

1415
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:48,640
story, like finally online years after the fact, but it's here and it's no extra cost. So hooray.

1416
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:53,040
Um, so never say never, but I also don't know if Nintendo would be interested in really,

1417
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,400
you know, going back and messing with, um, smash brothers, but they're still doing DLC.

1418
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:01,040
So it's not like, it's like a game that's completely, you know, in the archives at

1419
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:06,000
this point. So never say never. Um, but I think you, your suggestion is sound. Why not?

1420
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:15,280
Yeah. Why not? So, um, next email. Sure. In honor of mental health awareness month,

1421
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,680
how have you personally grown through gaming? And this is, this comes from D.

1422
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:24,080
This is a heavy question. Thank you for the question though. I think it's important to

1423
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:28,640
talk about, um, but, uh, maybe not everyone necessarily wants to, you read the question

1424
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:32,400
one more time in chat, pay attention. If you're willing to share, I'd love to read some of your

1425
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,240
responses as well. I'm not sure we're all going to have one, but, um, if you could read the question

1426
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:41,840
one more time, dark soccer in honor of mental health awareness month, how have you personally

1427
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:49,680
grown through gaming? Um, for me, and I've talked a little bit about this on the show in the past,

1428
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:54,960
but like when I was young, um, and I'm talking like fourth, fifth, sixth grade,

1429
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:00,480
I was bullied a lot because I was a little more effeminate than a little more nerdy than some,

1430
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:07,360
uh, other kids my age. Um, but video, so it was this weird thing where I would get picked on by

1431
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:15,840
other kids, but because I played video games, then those bullies would try to talk to me later when

1432
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:22,640
nobody else was around and ask me for video game tips. So it was this weird thing where like the

1433
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:29,200
fact that I was such a gamer and I played video games made bullies show another side of themselves

1434
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:34,480
to me. It was very strange. Um, but that's just like this weird thing that I grew up with because

1435
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:38,720
of games. I know that's like really, really old, but obviously this formative years were like huge

1436
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:45,520
on my mental health and so forth. Um, and, um, it's easy. I also kind of think of the times

1437
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:52,800
when I was younger and I'm talking like 22, 23, probably just before the show started,

1438
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:59,440
I came out as gay when I was in my 20, when I was 20. Uh, and so those first few years, you know,

1439
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:03,200
and then like, you know, OLR started four, four years later. But in those first few years,

1440
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:08,320
I found a lot in the gay community that like, it was like a lot of like judgment

1441
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:14,000
and stuff when I was a gamer, it was like, oh, you play video games. Like, and it was, if it,

1442
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,560
you know, it was hard to get a date because it was like, oh, I don't know fashion. I don't know,

1443
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:24,080
uh, you know, the latest, uh, I'm not trying to be stereotypical, but these are like things that

1444
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:30,400
I faced back then is it was like, I am like a nerdy type and that wasn't desirable. Now,

1445
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:34,880
the nice thing isn't what, you know, your question is, is a little bit more of a positive and how I

1446
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:40,480
make this a positive is that I really do see us now all these years later, haven't done this show

1447
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:46,080
for 20 years before. I think a lot of that is getting better, but to tie it back to something

1448
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:52,400
else we talked about earlier in the show, it's because people like me have been able to find my

1449
02:15:52,400 --> 02:16:00,080
tribe. And that's why the tagging in that shit is so important. Like I'm living proof, you know,

1450
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:07,760
and now I'm in this position where I actually have it kind of good, you know, as a, as a cis white

1451
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:12,480
gay dude, you know what I mean? So I have privileges that a lot of other people are

1452
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:17,760
still trying to, you know, find their tribes and, and, uh, work together to, uh, you know,

1453
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:22,960
educate the rest of society on, you know, these, these other issues. So anyway, that's kind of why

1454
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,040
I bring that up is I do think that that was something where gaming, but I never, I never

1455
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:33,040
apologized for it either. I never tried to be something I wasn't, you know, like, I liked games

1456
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:38,400
deal with it. People should just always be themselves and you'll find the, you know,

1457
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:45,200
the right people when you're your authentic self, uh, reading some comments from chat,

1458
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,200
and then I'll go to dark soccer and Loki. If they have anything they want to add, um, pod culture

1459
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,320
says animal crossing has helped me with calming from anxiety. Gaming in general has helped with

1460
02:16:54,320 --> 02:17:00,720
my depression. Um, act deaf says, I think video games helped me socialize more. I was a really

1461
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:06,240
shy person still am kind of, but making connections through gaming allowed me to speak up to others.

1462
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:10,880
Oh, this, you know, you don't talk mental health gaming has been critical during this pandemic

1463
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:17,760
critical. I w I would not have made it if I couldn't play MMOs with people online or, uh,

1464
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:22,320
animal crossing and this stuff, you know, like I, I think they've been more important than ever

1465
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:25,920
with everything that we're going through. Um, Jamie, do you have anything you want to add?

1466
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:30,320
You don't have to, but I want to give you guys an opportunity. Gaming was always my outlet

1467
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:36,080
and I learned a lot through it. And honestly, I've never made any apologies for being a gamer.

1468
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:41,680
Yeah. Um, certainly coming to doing this show is really given me thicker skin.

1469
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:48,480
Yeah. You know, um, and you obviously you've had to deal with that in a way that Loki and I don't,

1470
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:52,640
I've, I've gotten, you know, I just a little bit over the years I get the whole, you know,

1471
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,640
you remember when we would get the email that would be like, you're so Rob, you're so cool,

1472
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:01,440
but I wish you would look to Jesus to, you know, uh, with your lifestyle, you know,

1473
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:07,520
all that kind of stuff, which it's unfortunate, but, um, my answer is no, I'm not gonna change

1474
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:14,000
who I am. Uh, and no, no thing that you, uh, you can believe all you want about all that,

1475
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:21,760
but like I, my maker made me who I am period. So anyway. Um, and, uh, yeah. So anyways, but,

1476
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:27,360
but you dark soccer, you've had to, you know, you get the real trash bag. Well, more so in the past

1477
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:31,360
though. Again, I think that's a, well, I'm not to, not to dismiss or say it doesn't happen at

1478
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:36,960
all, but you, I think you would agree. It was a lot worse than the earlier years before more women

1479
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:44,720
were podcasting. Let's be real. It's just a matter of, I'm trying to think of how to phrase it,

1480
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:52,080
of sticking to your guns and staying authentic. Um, let me get some more chat comments. Uh,

1481
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:56,000
DJ Rama S says one game got me through a very bad time in my teenage years.

1482
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,920
That game is secretive manna. I was, that was an incredible game. Um, I'm sure, you know,

1483
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:06,640
how it applied for you in that situation was very different from how it applied for me. But

1484
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:12,800
I think that game means a lot to a lot of different things to many people. Um, SSU 100 Matt says,

1485
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:17,680
but personally gaming has helped me manage stress and help me get out of my downtimes in my life.

1486
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:21,680
Sometimes the distraction and working on constructive in a different media has helped

1487
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:27,120
me get out of my own head and out of depressive times. Interesting construction and creativity

1488
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:32,400
and that sort of thing. I, I, we hear that a lot. Um, pardon me, one more comment here. Um,

1489
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:39,040
meshkins in our chat says this show along with gaming has helped me discover myself and who I am

1490
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:45,920
and I'm slowly coming into myself and who I am as a person that is, um, I don't know if there's

1491
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,400
a better compliment somebody could give us about this show. So I just thank you so much for that.

1492
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:54,960
And when people say, you know, even though just earlier in the show, I was like, I don't know

1493
02:19:54,960 --> 02:20:01,520
how this show gets past 20 years. When I think of things like that, then I kind of go, I probably

1494
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:10,960
got another five years in me. Am I right? You know, so, um, thank you for that. All right.

1495
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:14,880
Anyhow. Um, uh, Loki, I don't want to skip you. Do you have anything you want to add?

1496
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:19,440
Oh, I just met lots of people through gaming, but I don't think it's really,

1497
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:26,160
I don't know. I don't think it changed. Fair enough. Fair enough. I guess, but,

1498
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:29,520
but it's, it's mental health in the way that again, it's finding, it's finding your people,

1499
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,200
it's finding your tribe. It's, it's, it's the same thing, even if it's in a different way,

1500
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:37,680
you know? True. Yeah. Yes. I guess that makes sense. Yeah. All right. Um, thank you for the

1501
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:43,200
email for, for such a short succinct email. That was a hard hitting, but really good question. Um,

1502
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:47,600
and it's important. We talk about mental health. Uh, we've, we sure talked enough about COVID.

1503
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:52,080
That's a physical health thing. Why don't we talk about mental health as frequently?

1504
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:55,920
It's good to know. Yeah. All right. Anyway, uh, is there more, I think there's at least one more,

1505
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:03,840
right? Um, yeah, just one more. So, um, and this comes from our own Rama. Hey Rob,

1506
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:08,880
oh, it's for you. Okay. Um, I, I had mentioned before that I may know the reason why patches

1507
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:12,960
for console games are huge. You might think it's crazy, but please bear in mind the company I used

1508
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:19,280
to work for. Okay. Most Xbox games are run in a virtual environment as a disc image, especially

1509
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:24,800
the Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are backwards compatible. So what companies do is patch the

1510
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:29,600
game and upload it so that if the game you bought has a patch, it will still be, it will still

1511
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:34,400
download the game instead of copying the disc. But the disc still will be the license key to

1512
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:39,840
play the game. This is done so that the console doesn't have to run any commands to patch the game

1513
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,640
in case the patching goes wrong. Um, and given your recent issue with Mass Effect,

1514
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:50,240
legendary edition EA screwed up the patching on that. And if you notice Sony does something

1515
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:55,760
similar with PlayStation games, I know that sounds crazy, but companies feel it's easier that way,

1516
02:21:55,760 --> 02:22:00,720
but they don't realize the burden it puts on those data caps. I hope this answers your questions.

1517
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:05,760
If not, let me know and I'll see what I can do game on y'all DJ run mass. No, he said it right

1518
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:09,920
there at the end. They don't realize the burden that they're putting on us normal people with

1519
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:15,840
data caps. Bingo. That was it. So I'm, I'm, but, but as far as like your explanation and stuff,

1520
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:20,160
it doesn't make sense, but I, you know, because I'm pretty sure most of the times all the disc

1521
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:26,320
is doing, especially now on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, where the whole solid state drive

1522
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:31,200
is part of the experience. You can't do that from a disc. So yes, it pulls down the whole disc and

1523
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:34,960
basically like, or, you know, the, the parts that it needs and basically puts it on your drive.

1524
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:39,600
And that disc at that point is just how you unlock and play it. Uh, so that the game knows

1525
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:43,040
you still have the license rights to be able to use it. All of that makes perfect sense.

1526
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,000
Why can't the patching just patch the parts that have already installed my hard drive? That's I,

1527
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,960
and that's what they're all missing. Um, I, and I get what you, I, again, I understand what you're

1528
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:58,160
saying, but at the same time, I just wish they would approach it differently so that it can be

1529
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:05,360
more respectful of that whole thing. Yeah. All right. Any other emails? All right. No.

1530
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:11,600
All right. Um, let's get into, uh, Bobby does point out some patches are large because the

1531
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:16,800
files on your hard drive are compressed. Interesting. You know, steam takes forever

1532
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:21,520
to patch things like dead by daylight. And I always thought it took so damn long because it

1533
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:26,960
was uncompressing, patching, compressing. And honestly, if I have to wait longer to have that

1534
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:32,240
experience on console for smaller patches, I'm more than happy to take it. But I get the consoles

1535
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:36,800
are probably a little more confined with the drive space. It just, it just sucks. Can I just

1536
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:43,920
sit here as a gamer and say, it sucks. I don't like it. All right. Um, Hey Shad, Starsix in

1537
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:47,840
chat. You missed, you missed the birthday shout out earlier. I'm not doing it again,

1538
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:53,040
but I hope you had a good one. Uh, Shad, Starsix in chat and says, why is resident evil eight such

1539
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:58,640
a good game? And the second area of the game, the scariest thing in gaming since PT or resident

1540
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:04,640
evil seven VR discuss. Um, I couldn't tell you cause I haven't played it, but from what I've

1541
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:11,920
heard about it, cause I've caught some things here and there. Um, it's just sounds, it sounds scary

1542
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:17,440
because the character design is pretty crazy. Uh, it is not, from what I understand the lady

1543
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:22,240
Dimitrescu and that is not like, she's just one part of the game. She's kind of like,

1544
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:29,280
like in mega man, she would be like quick man. And then you still have other people you have

1545
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,920
to fight quick man was the tall one, right? No, it was that flash, man. I forget anyway.

1546
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:41,440
Uh, but otherwise I would ask, see, Alan is right over there and I would ask him about

1547
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:45,440
resident evil seven because he's been playing it on his stream, except, um, he's not wearing

1548
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:50,320
a shirt right now and he's cooking, so I can't really bring him on stream. But, um, I know he's

1549
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:54,320
been going through resident evil seven and I know that's, I haven't watched him play. I am very

1550
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:59,120
supportive of my husband streaming and you should follow him at Allen alchemy. Can he even hear me

1551
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:02,240
talking about him right now with his headphones in? Probably not. No, he thinks he's listening

1552
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:07,200
to something else. Um, but, uh, I would, uh, I will not watch the resident evil seven stuff

1553
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:15,280
cause there's too damn many jumpscares and my old heart can't take it. But anyway, um,

1554
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:21,760
all right, let's see other comments in chat. Um, let's see. Uh, Oh, Oh, thank you. Chatter

1555
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:25,680
chatters are given chain. The birthday wishes now in chat since he missed his at the beginning

1556
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:29,920
of the show. I talked about that text you sent me with the damn Tron arcade one up.

1557
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:34,480
All right. Anyway, uh, Oh, I'll get to discord and then we'll get some last minute stories.

1558
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:38,880
Cause I know we have a few of those tonight. Um, but first, uh, let me do a couple topics

1559
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:43,040
from discord. There was one thing, okay. And so over on discord, of course, over at vog

1560
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:47,600
network.com slash discord, we'll get you into our server and we have a whole channel for orange

1561
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:51,680
lounge radio and you guys like to post things there throughout the week, including, Ooh,

1562
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:56,880
I didn't know about this. They're making a technical documentary. Interesting called

1563
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:02,240
touching sound. Oh, it's already out and you can stream it on something called to be,

1564
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:06,800
which is one of those app services. You can stream that for free. Is that literally about

1565
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:12,560
DJ max technica and that it has to be, it's the same thing. So I wonder now, now Shane's in chat,

1566
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:18,720
I wonder if he knows about this, a whole movie documentary on technica. That's interesting. All

1567
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:24,800
right. Uh, something else they've been posting about, uh, in our discord server, I think this

1568
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:29,920
is very interesting. Tiger claw linked us to a tweet, uh, that is an indie developer making a

1569
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:35,120
fighting game, but it uses cars and there's actually, uh, some little, uh, video of this

1570
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,400
in action. It looks very interesting. Uh, I didn't catch what the name of the game is though, but the

1571
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:46,240
tweet, the person on Twitter who did this, uh, fontace ranter is, uh, the person that did this.

1572
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:49,760
And there's some other people that were kind of just discussing it and, uh, Oh, it's called

1573
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:53,520
shut up and drive. Thank you that there. Cause there's an FAQ that was linked there. So.

1574
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:59,360
Isn't that a Rihanna song? Uh, it is. And one of the greatest lip syncs in drag race history. Yes.

1575
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:04,400
But, uh, in this case, it's also a video game. She doesn't own that phrase. Uh, shut up and

1576
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:08,320
drive is something we've all been saying on the freeway for a long time. It was used in, um,

1577
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:14,000
uh, wreck it Ralph. That's right. You can't help but hear that though. When, uh, you know, you,

1578
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,720
you see a name like that and you know, even though this is an indie studio, I hope somehow Rihanna

1579
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:23,680
would give the rights so that it can be in the trailer. Shut up and drive. Okay. I better not

1580
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:30,080
sing too much or we're going to get DCM made. Um, Tiger claw also linked us to a tweet from

1581
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:36,720
X-Box where, uh, they were talking about it's 2007. What are you booting up? And the screenshot had

1582
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:42,800
halo three bio shock mass effect and rock band. This was a play on another viral tweet, uh,

1583
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:48,080
that was like a movie had made like an eighties cinema with some quintessential eighties films.

1584
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:53,760
So they like photoshopped it. And I was like, Oh, rock band for sure. Hello. Hello. Anyway,

1585
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,360
let's do some last minute stories and I'll do a few more of your comments from discord. Um,

1586
02:27:57,360 --> 02:28:00,720
dark soccer, I think you mentioned you had something tonight that you wanted to fit in here.

1587
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:06,400
I did. It's just a little something, but on the 25th, so this Tuesday, um,

1588
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:12,000
uh, there's going to be an announcement for dead by daylight and they've already teased this,

1589
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:17,280
but for resident evil's 25th anniversary, um, dead by daylight is getting, uh, resident evil,

1590
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:23,520
uh, a resident evil chapter for their 20th chapter. Um, lots of speculation as to what's

1591
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:31,360
going on. They are saying that there's, uh, um, highlights back to the classics.

1592
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,920
So there's a lot of people thinking that it's going to be centered around the original resident

1593
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,080
evil. There's still people who are thinking it's going to be like from village. I don't know,

1594
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:44,880
but the hope is that, I mean, one of the big theories out there is that this is actually

1595
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:51,360
going to be multiple maps. Um, and at least two killers and two survivors. So we'll see

1596
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:58,960
a big pack if that's true. I that's so, well, I mean the stranger things, one was one killer,

1597
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:06,800
a map and two survivors and that's like 12 bucks. Yeah. So this is, if it's that big,

1598
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:12,960
it's probably going to at least be $20 DLC and I will do it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I, I would love

1599
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:17,920
to see village in it. Um, I personally, I would love to see lady David Trescu. I think she's just

1600
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:23,040
such a character and she'd be so good as a killer in day by day by daylight. I have heard the rumor

1601
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:27,600
about her daughters being one of the killers and that they're witches that you can like switch

1602
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:33,120
between and shape shift. I think that's kind of cool too. I'm down with that. Someone did a mod

1603
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:41,840
that turns, I think Dwight into Ethan or David into Ethan cause the body shape and then, um,

1604
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:47,280
one of the daughters into nurse or from nurse. Hmm. Interesting. But I think a lot of the heavy

1605
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:54,240
rumors are that it's Jill and Leon and it's a nemesis and I'm kind of like, you're probably

1606
02:29:54,240 --> 02:30:04,960
right. I thought I read who's the character in four. I thought that was, I didn't play four.

1607
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:09,360
Okay. That was Leon though. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, but if they were going to do Leon,

1608
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:14,480
it should be like Leon and Claire. I mean, I think they would do Jill and Chris and have

1609
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:19,920
skins for Leon and Claire. Oh, that makes sense. Cause they are speaking of stranger things. They

1610
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:24,960
are doing a skin for Steve to turn him into the other character. It doesn't look right. Cause

1611
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:32,800
his face structure is so different. No, it doesn't. Um, uh, but the, uh, I think, I mean,

1612
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:37,040
I think it would honestly be super possible, especially if it's nemesis, it would be really

1613
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:42,800
easy to have a cosmetic for mr. X. Yeah. Um, I'm still going to cross my fingers that the

1614
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:47,840
vampress, the vampires or the witches are going to be the killer, but I think we're going to get

1615
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:52,560
skins for those. If it's nemesis, I'll still buy, who am I kidding? I'm going to buy it.

1616
02:30:52,560 --> 02:31:00,240
And look at what they did for, for, uh, Heather in, uh, in the, sorry, Cheryl. I played her as

1617
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:08,480
Heather. So long. I still call her Heather. Um, in, uh, uh, the re the silent Hill chapter

1618
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:16,320
is that they gave her the, uh, Sybil skin and the, uh, the nurse, what was her name?

1619
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:26,960
Lisa, Lisa Garland. And that they, uh, also gave her the, um, uh, Alyssa skin.

1620
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:33,360
Um, our R H M zero eight seven in chat says, would it be strange for one of the survivors

1621
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:37,760
to have special powers? See my previous comment on Scott Howard, not to be confused with Scott

1622
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,560
McCall. Um, no, no, no, it would not be weird for, you know, they'll, they'll do a talent.

1623
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:49,040
That's gonna mix things up perks. Like for example, um, you got, you know, perks that

1624
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:54,560
let you fight back from Laurie. Yeah. Or, um, I would say the biggest example is a leather face,

1625
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:59,680
uh, and barbecue and chili is like a, a, I don't want to say a mandatory killer talent,

1626
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:03,600
but the quality of life from that singular talent, it's like, you kind of like, like,

1627
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:10,000
you have to get that DLC, which what a clever way to make people buy DLC, huh? But, um, yeah.

1628
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:13,520
So yes, they could do, they could do things that are really going to mix it up,

1629
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,800
but I don't think they would be unique to the character. They'd be unique to the perks.

1630
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:24,960
Um, yeah, but the whole thing is, is that the, the, um, the survivors cannot attack a killer

1631
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:33,440
except for like blind, the escape tactics, like decisive strike. Um, so, you know,

1632
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:40,560
and you do have like distraction, things like the pebble, everyone loves the pebble. Um, um,

1633
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:45,520
I'm sorry, that's good. And like things like that are good for against killers that, you know,

1634
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:52,480
are use audio based clues like, um, nurse and a spirit for example. Yeah. But yeah, I think that,

1635
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:58,160
um, we're not going to have any that can actually just legit fight back or David, the character,

1636
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:01,760
David would have been completely screwed over. Cause that was his whole storyline as a fighter.

1637
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:05,760
Um, an RHM in chat says a literal werewolf. I just, I just don't think so. They're not,

1638
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:09,520
they can't do anything that's going to completely like turning into a werewolf and being able to

1639
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:14,160
run super fast or whatever the werewolf can do like fight back. We already have sprint burst.

1640
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:18,640
Yeah. I already have dead hard. They can't do something that's going to completely break the

1641
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:23,280
game. And it's also, it's part of dead by daylight's nature that the perks transfer from

1642
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,880
character to character. So somebody can turn into a werewolf. They all need to be able to turn into

1643
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:31,760
werewolf. And that would just be a little, a little weird now, but at the same time,

1644
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:35,520
they've talked to, you know, and I don't want to completely dismiss the comment. It's a fair

1645
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:41,680
idea because they have also said it's the fifth anniversary. This resident evil thing is going

1646
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:45,200
to change up the game a little bit. We have new things in store for this game. You know,

1647
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:49,040
it's five years old and people are just now finding it and we're going to mix it up a little

1648
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:55,040
bit. So I say all this, but at the same time, maybe they will do something completely radical

1649
02:33:55,040 --> 02:34:00,720
and different. Um, your idea is not farfetched in that regard. So there's one way to find out and

1650
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:07,440
that's watch on Tuesday. So I'm excited about it. Are you? Um, yeah, yeah. I mean, now that I'm into

1651
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:12,480
this game for sure. I want to see the reveal. I'm actually almost more interested in the roadmap

1652
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:17,760
for the future. Yeah. Well, they're, they're going to definitely be doing some talking about that on,

1653
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:26,080
um, on a Tuesday as well. I'm glad it's my day off. Um, but, but that DLC itself is going to

1654
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:32,640
be coming out, um, later on in June. Yeah. Um, okay. Now, uh, let me get to some other

1655
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,720
discord comments and I'll check in with Loki here. Um, let's see. Oh, I thought this was

1656
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:41,680
interesting. Dungeon buster shared a tweet, uh, from Jason Schreier. Hope I said that right.

1657
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:46,720
Who said, uh, it was kind of countering and he's, he's does game journalism stuff. I'm sorry. I

1658
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:49,680
don't, I don't follow them all. I don't know who they work for. Cause they always move around and

1659
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:54,080
stuff. Sorry. I, sorry. Uh, but, uh, it says rumors like this keep floating around, but

1660
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:59,280
starfield is nowhere near done. According to several people familiar with development,

1661
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:03,440
it'll be at E3, but the plan release date I've heard is way later than most people think.

1662
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:08,960
Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't either, but at the same time,

1663
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:15,840
Bethesda usually doesn't show the inner workings of the game until it is ready.

1664
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:20,240
So I'm not completely pushing back on the comment. I mean, obviously he has more industry,

1665
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:26,640
you know, insiders and stuff than I certainly do, but I would wonder how much are they really going

1666
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:32,160
to show it if they're not ready to show, you know, to, to release the game, that's not usually

1667
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:37,920
Bethesda's thing. At the same time, something very different has happened in the last year with

1668
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:44,080
Bethesda. Microsoft bought them. So maybe that is going to change their entire approach. That is

1669
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:50,160
certainly a, uh, thought within the realm of possibility. It is plausible. All right. I'll

1670
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:57,840
just fucking say it. It's plausible. So, but we'll see at E3, huh? All right. Uh, Bobby says he's

1671
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:02,320
actually a journalist doing actual journalism. He's with Bloomberg. Thank you. I can, I can never

1672
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:06,960
follow. They're at Kotaku one day, Polygon the next, then they're going, they're, they're working

1673
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:13,360
at a newspaper somewhere else. Sorry. It's just, it's hard to keep track. All right. Anyhow. Uh,

1674
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:18,080
let's see. Loki, do you have any last minute stories? Um, yeah, I did have one. Unfortunately,

1675
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:24,080
the servers for LittleBigPlanet had to be shut down temporarily because somebody hacked into

1676
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:29,920
them and put a bunch of transphobic comments everywhere on all of the different, um, levels.

1677
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:38,480
So, um, well, at least, you know what, as old as that game is at this point,

1678
02:36:38,480 --> 02:36:43,760
I'm glad they're doing the right thing and fucking stopping that. So you know what? It's

1679
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:47,600
the temporary shutdown. They just have to clean the issue up, but it's, it's because it's so

1680
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:53,920
widespread. I see this as a good thing. Not the hack, not that, but the fact that Sony is still

1681
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,600
going back and addressing it and cleaning it the fuck up. That's a good thing. Thank you.

1682
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:03,280
Yeah. Oh, is that it? That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I think we're about to the

1683
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:07,760
end of the show and, uh, Alan just finished dinner, so I'm ready to eat. So we're going

1684
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:12,400
to wrap things up. Uh, thank you guys for listening to our show tonight. Really appreciate you guys.

1685
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:15,920
We had a lot of great topics tonight. Just really appreciate you guys being here. Um,

1686
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:19,680
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

1687
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:22,720
show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1688
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:27,680
but we need more gamers in here to have their voices heard. Um, a nice five star review on a

1689
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:32,960
site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show. It goes an awful long way. Um, hosting on

1690
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:37,600
your Twitch channel, whether you're here live or not, um, it goes a long way and is super

1691
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:41,600
appreciated. Just type slash host a VOG network in your own chat. Actually you want to add it to

1692
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,360
your auto host list is even better because the slash command just does it one time. Um,

1693
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:49,440
but yeah, thank you guys for being here. If you feel so inclined, we have a shop,

1694
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:56,320
vognetwork.com slash shop. Um, and, um, yeah. Uh, thank you just for being a part of this and all

1695
02:37:56,320 --> 02:38:01,360
the great comments and nice things you had to say tonight. Really appreciate you. Um, let's go

1696
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:08,240
around and get everybody's final thoughts. Um, I will start tonight because somebody did a redeem

1697
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:13,200
with a post show shout out. So technically it's supposed to be after the show, but I just have to

1698
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:20,240
read it now. Uh, fat ninja DM redeemed this, uh, earlier and said, as always you guys and gals

1699
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:25,280
from the VOG network, knock it out of the park every week. I stepped away from podcast for years

1700
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:30,480
and then got back into it. And OLR was the first podcast I started looking for. If I could describe

1701
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:36,720
OLR in one word, it would be timeless. OLR always adjust to the video game and social landscape.

1702
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:41,120
Can't gush about you guys and gals enough. Keep doing what you're doing much love and respect.

1703
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:46,160
Thank you so much for that. And it was funny. Yeah. I have heard something along the line,

1704
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:51,520
not, not quite. You put it very, very kindly and very complimentary, but I have heard the whole,

1705
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:57,280
um, I, I, uh, I was randomly looking up orange lounge radio. Cause I remembered listening to

1706
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:05,120
that in the DDR freak days. You guys are still going. Dang. That's that's usually what they're

1707
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:11,440
still going. The fuck? Yeah. It's usually the reaction I hear. So, um, thank you for putting

1708
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:17,920
it a lot nicer. Although I appreciate everyone that discovers the show. I hope you're not too

1709
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:24,000
disappointed. We don't exclusively talk about DDR music games anymore. We still love those games an

1710
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:30,160
awful lot. Trust. So, all right. Yeah. Bobby Blackwell. When I meet people, they say, yeah,

1711
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:34,960
I used to listen to you 15 years ago. Yeah. I have many former listeners. Yeah. Same,

1712
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:40,560
same. If we show up at a convention or something, it'll be like, I, when I first got my iPhone,

1713
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:47,120
I downloaded you. And then it's like, what'd you do after that? Oh, I unsubscribed. Oh, okay.

1714
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:53,680
Tea. It's it's fine. It's fine. I understand. Look, as long as you're supporting an independent

1715
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:59,680
broadcaster or broadcast team somewhere and supporting independent voices, um, you know,

1716
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:04,640
celebrities are really taking over podcasting. And look, sometimes that's a cool thing. I like

1717
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:09,600
the Trixie and Katya podcast. Okay. I'm going to listen to that Lori Beth Denver podcast. I get it.

1718
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:14,480
But at the same time, it is so important to support our indie scene as well. And these

1719
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:19,360
people, you know, really working hard, uh, from, from the love of the games and the industry and

1720
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:25,760
so much, um, out of their spare bedrooms on Skype or discord where a stream yard is another big one

1721
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:30,400
or wherever they are. Um, it just support your indie friends and indie podcasters. It means a

1722
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:37,440
lot. Okay. Um, sorry. That was a very long final thought, but, um, I had to do it. So Loki,

1723
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:41,120
how about you? How's your, what's your final thought? Uh, final thought is, like I said,

1724
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:47,280
uh, I'm hoping that my second episode of my, um, YouTube series done today and then episode

1725
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:52,880
three be becoming much sooner. I've been making the mistake of doing too much in between stuff.

1726
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:58,640
So I planning things out a little bit better. So, uh, I've already got what's going to be in

1727
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:04,960
episode three and so they'll become much sooner. So look forward to that. Nice orange ride and

1728
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:09,680
chat says orange launch radio, my source of vital information. Thank you. Maybe that'll be the

1729
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:14,080
future tagline. All right. Uh, Dar soccer last, but certainly not least your final thought.

1730
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:19,520
Stay tuned. I'm going to be doing some dead by daylight and hopefully not screwing up with my

1731
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:25,280
new mouse. So we'll see. Oh, you changed that. I forgot that you got a new mouse. Oh,

1732
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:29,440
I haven't started using it yet. So I'm probably going to try it on stream. I just,

1733
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:32,880
I've been using a thumb track ball and I'm actually starting to get like some repetitive

1734
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:40,160
thumb problems. Oh, so, um, that, and if you ever watch any of my streams or my clips, you'll see

1735
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:45,680
it's kind of jerky. Yeah. Yeah. I could tell your track ball was doing that. So I'm actually

1736
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:50,320
excited for you to see how that might improve, um, by having the mouse now. It'll be interesting.

1737
02:41:50,320 --> 02:41:55,760
Yeah, we'll see. So, um, so yeah, I'm going to go ahead and drop out for now. Yep. But,

1738
02:41:55,760 --> 02:42:01,280
um, have a good night, everybody. I hope to see you in, in stream and, uh, don't text me

1739
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:04,240
when I'm trying to do the readouts. You'll get the rate in like four minutes. Okay.

1740
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:09,600
Uh, I, I will let me know when you're ready and I'll let you know if I'm out of the,

1741
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:16,720
okay. Okay. You got it. All right. Later kids. All right. Um, on that note, I will say good night to

1742
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:21,200
everybody. I'm here at orange launch radio. Um, of course, for those listening live, we'll be back

1743
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:25,520
after the credits as we usually are just to do some final shout outs. Um, but for everybody out

1744
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:31,120
there, podcast feed and live reminder, we're taken next week off Rob wants a vacation. Um,

1745
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:36,560
so have a good, it's weird to say happy Memorial day. Cause it's not exactly a happy, but I want

1746
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:43,600
to just say, you know, have a good long weekend. Um, you know, it's been a crazy year and a half.

1747
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:47,440
And I think a lot of people are going to be able to do, even if things aren't back to normal yet,

1748
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:51,040
and they shouldn't be completely normal. I think a lot of us are going to get to do things where

1749
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:54,720
we get like a taste of that back, you know, talk about mental health and all that. A lot of us

1750
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:58,400
are going to get to get, get a taste, see some people that are also vaccinated that we haven't

1751
02:42:58,400 --> 02:43:03,040
seen in a long time and all that stuff. I hope this Memorial day is a good one, uh, for many

1752
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:07,520
of you out there. And if you want to stay home all weekend and play video games, you know what,

1753
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:12,720
that is fine too. Have a great time doing it. We'll see you in 14 days with another new episode

1754
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:18,400
