00:00.000 --> 00:13.620
The console arm trace continues to be interesting, since graphics quality can no longer grow

00:13.620 --> 00:17.520
as dramatically as it did generation over generation. Xbox rode the wave of Kinect across

00:17.520 --> 00:21.420
two generations, but as of the series generation they have no extra piece of gaming tech, while

00:21.420 --> 00:27.520
rumors say that Sony's PSVR2 or PS5VR will be impressive, challenging even today's

00:27.520 --> 00:31.800
VR headsets. The story of consoles never ends, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

00:31.800 --> 00:35.240
Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about it and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting

00:35.240 --> 00:37.440
right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.440 --> 00:45.080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.080 --> 00:51.880
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight

00:51.880 --> 01:01.960
with episode number 869 of our show for this May the 18th, no 16th of 2021 I can't read

01:01.960 --> 01:07.980
my own numbers. Hi I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co-hosts say hello as always

01:07.980 --> 01:15.380
to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi how are you? I've had a long day but a fairly

01:15.380 --> 01:24.180
good day. Yeah. I went to one of my favorite places to eat and loaded up on, finally they're

01:24.180 --> 01:28.900
back to having the pink garlic sauce at Pita Kitchen. Nice. Just saying. Oh I don't think

01:28.900 --> 01:33.940
that was there. Sumac is delicious. Yeah, yeah one of our favorite local little restaurants.

01:33.940 --> 01:37.940
We are based in Sacramento, California so sometimes it's, and all three of us live in

01:37.940 --> 01:43.300
the area, we live in the suburbs if nothing else, and so sometimes we can't avoid the

01:43.300 --> 01:48.380
local chat such as favorite restaurants, but if you happen to be local and you know

01:48.380 --> 01:53.700
this place Pita Kitchen, I was just telling Jamie before the show, Alan and I were there

01:53.700 --> 01:58.340
like a week and a half ago and it was it was marvelous and it's a small little restaurant

01:58.340 --> 02:03.060
you know it's like a small team that runs it so I'm really glad they're still around

02:03.060 --> 02:07.860
that's for sure. Absolutely but you know we they had some different stuff there in their

02:07.860 --> 02:13.740
little grocery store and I picked up some spinach and cheese pies they're wrapped in

02:13.740 --> 02:18.060
filo dough they're absolutely they're like giant spanakopita it's really delicious. Get

02:18.060 --> 02:23.620
the baklava because I've had bad baklava but theirs is really good. Theirs is always delightful

02:23.620 --> 02:28.740
and we actually got into a discussion on like how terrible making filo dough is and she's

02:28.740 --> 02:38.980
like we don't make it. Awesome. But yeah we had a really good time but I'm really irritated

02:38.980 --> 02:43.780
that the the pet store that I go to does not have Midniss food nor had they had it for

02:43.780 --> 02:50.260
the last three weeks and I get her refrigerated food so they don't like keep any extra stock

02:50.260 --> 02:58.060
and pack so I had to buy her raw food. I was gonna tell you we can't even like the food

02:58.100 --> 03:03.340
that Smoosh eats we can't even get it at like the big brand we have to go to the indie pet

03:03.340 --> 03:08.340
store over by Lomond's that's the only place that will have the food and that's not the

03:08.340 --> 03:11.180
closest pet store to us but it's whatever it's the only place that has the food that

03:11.180 --> 03:14.100
Smoosh will eat so you should check that but maybe they have the food. What are you feeding

03:14.100 --> 03:19.460
him like caviar from a live sturgeon? No it's just a certain brand he's he's a weird kitty

03:19.460 --> 03:23.900
you all know that he doesn't he doesn't really care for kitty treats either it's it's interesting

03:23.900 --> 03:29.860
so anyway we will get to get look local discussion is inevitable sometimes if you if you are

03:29.860 --> 03:34.460
unaware with the history of our show you know we we are the longest running video game podcast

03:34.460 --> 03:39.460
because we started well video game show because we started this in online show we started

03:39.460 --> 03:44.900
this in 2002 so podcasting wasn't even really a thing yet but we we did get in on podcasting

03:44.900 --> 03:49.380
really early it was before it was on iTunes when you had to use things like lemon pod

03:49.380 --> 03:53.940
I think it was called to a sink your podcast was like 2005 we won the very first podcast

03:53.940 --> 03:58.540
award in gaming we were fortunate for that but anyway we've and I have the award yes

03:58.540 --> 04:04.860
you do there it is uh yeah 2005 uh dark soccer Loki and myself um hi tech master Loki by

04:04.860 --> 04:13.060
the way I hate to make you sit there in silence my bad but we all met playing dance dance

04:13.060 --> 04:18.800
revolution at Roseville golf lands so we there is a local sense of connection here

04:18.800 --> 04:23.420
on the show and you know in those early years if you didn't already know the story at OLR

04:23.420 --> 04:27.780
we talked a lot about DDR that was our scene and that was our community and then Konami

04:27.780 --> 04:32.220
kind of abandoned DDR for a few years and then wanted a seat at the table again once

04:32.220 --> 04:37.020
guitar hero and rock band got big and it was awkward but our show grew into all sorts of

04:37.020 --> 04:43.500
video games because we just love video games dang it right they're like looking at at rock

04:43.500 --> 04:50.300
band going um but what we had this oh you've got better button that's right Konami you

04:50.300 --> 04:55.620
had the opportunity and you didn't take the risk so someone beat you to it you blew it

04:55.620 --> 05:02.660
bitch that's I that's you know they even they even screwed up their own rendition of that

05:02.660 --> 05:07.260
as well considering that they had a winning formula and they're just like now let's put

05:07.260 --> 05:10.860
out rock revolution instead Loki I think your audio is coming through your webcam not your

05:10.860 --> 05:16.580
mic just you know it's it's kind of tin canny okay yeah you might want to check that anyway

05:16.580 --> 05:21.740
but while he fixed that live I'm gonna check our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

05:21.740 --> 05:25.820
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

05:25.820 --> 05:32.260
right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the voice of geeks Network twitch.tv slash vog network I

05:32.380 --> 05:38.700
almost said twitch.tv slash Bobby Black Wolf area for two yes much better for two reasons one I

05:38.700 --> 05:43.940
forgot to say happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf on our throw call tonight that was on my mind his

05:43.940 --> 05:48.980
birthday was this past week so happy belated birthday again I know he's 20 wriggling day go

05:48.980 --> 05:54.860
go figure so for the first time obviously happy happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf and congratulations

05:54.860 --> 06:00.620
to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who announced this week he will be an announcer during summer games

06:00.620 --> 06:05.660
done quick for the it's his third time at a games done quick event pretty much all the virtual ones

06:05.660 --> 06:10.660
at this point so congrats we don't know what games he's announcing yet we're expecting to find that

06:10.660 --> 06:16.700
out tomorrow but as I understand there are no Yakuza runs this year so there's not gonna be

06:16.700 --> 06:22.940
like a baby thing or any of that stuff that yeah I know too bad huh but it's well it's also at the

06:22.940 --> 06:28.140
same time we can say ah but I do love the games done quick like mixes up the games right because

06:28.140 --> 06:33.380
how are other games supposed to get a shot if you know it's always the same games so I think that's

06:33.380 --> 06:39.020
great um let's see some of the comments speaking of the local chat and then I promise we'll get

06:39.020 --> 06:44.820
into gaming news pod culture says how long has it been since Pinkberry was mentioned well that that

06:44.820 --> 06:50.900
is a bit of a local place but I think that I think it's a like a West Coast no it is it's

06:50.900 --> 06:56.860
international I've seen it in it hurts I've seen it in airports pinkberry in Atlanta I think it

06:56.860 --> 07:01.340
started at the airport I yeah I think it started in LA so there's like a lot of them in the West

07:01.340 --> 07:07.420
Coast but anyway long story short the one that are soccer and I used to go to closed and Alan

07:07.420 --> 07:14.140
also my husband kind of let it known that he has a preference for another place called Menchie's

07:14.140 --> 07:19.300
and so that's one of those yogurt battles I just give in on like my husband's allowed a nice thing

07:19.300 --> 07:25.500
once in a while and well they also good they also have dole whip it or Menchie's yes yes what

07:25.500 --> 07:32.460
yeah what yeah they do they do like a dole whip type thing so this has to happen I don't know if

07:32.460 --> 07:37.300
it's official though it but it's their own version of it they I don't think they can call it that but

07:37.300 --> 07:43.060
it's basically that yeah the you know what I still think we need to do is that we need to have a

07:43.060 --> 07:49.460
dinner at Brookfield and then go to pinkberry well you know especially now that I don't want

07:49.460 --> 07:55.940
to say the pandemic is over because it certainly isn't but now that we're getting vaccinated and

07:55.940 --> 08:00.900
you know it make light right now well you know I you still want to be cautious and I know there's

08:00.900 --> 08:05.380
the CDC guidance and a lot of people are a little skittish about that because unfortunately this

08:05.380 --> 08:11.140
panda I mean whereas the science says vaccinated people aren't gonna spread it you can hang out

08:11.140 --> 08:18.260
with other vaccinated people without a mask the reality is a lot of us are a little bit unfortunately

08:18.260 --> 08:23.500
this whole instance has seen the best in people and the worst in people and I don't trust people

08:23.500 --> 08:28.020
to be honest exactly and I don't think a lot of us do we don't trust other people to be honest and

08:28.020 --> 08:33.580
that's really unfortunate but hopefully more and more people get vaccinated and that'll that'll do

08:33.580 --> 08:39.300
the trick because the vaccinations are working that's it period so the more people to get

08:39.300 --> 08:43.140
vaccinated the less longer this is gone but anyway it's nice to think that some of those

08:43.140 --> 08:48.260
things are a possibility again like the you know Brookfield's trip and you know who may be going

08:48.260 --> 08:53.260
to see what a sad place Rosewood Golf Land is these days and what have you all those types of

08:53.260 --> 08:59.500
things so yeah who knows a lot of exciting stuff coming in the next few months I'm sure I think

08:59.500 --> 09:04.580
it would be fun to film a trip like that and put it as like a bonus video at vog network for our

09:04.580 --> 09:11.020
subscribers that might be fun so you know what though I legit haven't been to Pinkberry since

09:11.020 --> 09:16.660
2019 I haven't been in about a year myself I still like it like just because I give in and

09:16.660 --> 09:21.660
my husband gets to pick most of the time I still I still I still sneak and have it I'll be at an

09:21.660 --> 09:25.860
airport and I'll be like oh I'm gonna have that so didn't need blood orange back and then I'll go

09:25.860 --> 09:31.860
huh speaking of air pop go ahead I was gonna say I stopped going there because I just didn't like

09:31.860 --> 09:37.700
their flavors like I had one like they started doing these like kind of they were sort of ice

09:37.700 --> 09:43.380
cream but not ice cream and they just started like really weird flavors I didn't like so that's what

09:43.380 --> 09:47.660
pissed Alan off to their their flavor selection was so limited and once they would get a flavor

09:47.660 --> 09:51.620
that he really liked it would be gone at the end of the month they rotate something else yeah do

09:51.620 --> 09:58.500
do you know though what I what I miss hmm is I miss Naya the gelato place that was all in the

09:58.580 --> 10:03.740
area oh I don't I don't think I ever ate there maybe once so so alright and I'll get off of it

10:03.740 --> 10:08.660
after this but just imagine you have a place that has something like 20 different flavors of gelato

10:08.660 --> 10:14.100
and they rotate a lot of their flavors and they had champagne they had Guinness they had whole

10:14.100 --> 10:21.260
wheat that tasted like eating cereal they had like all kinds of just different ones and the

10:21.260 --> 10:29.900
alcoholic ones were actually alcoholic and I ate a big ol bowl of Guinness and champagne it was

10:29.900 --> 10:37.020
delightful no I miss is we had a place over here and I think it's a chain Rita's that's frozen

10:37.020 --> 10:43.820
custard yes the one that's nearby all right all right look super disappointed that's so so good

10:43.820 --> 10:49.500
look can you tell me when ice cream I get that snacking is important and if if the chat wasn't

10:49.620 --> 10:54.940
lighting up going mmm gelato yes Rita's like if the chat wasn't supporting this we probably would

10:54.940 --> 10:58.940
have cut it off a while ago but I do want to get into some gaming news because there was quite a

10:58.940 --> 11:04.300
bit of it this week I'm gonna say okay I won't even talk then about the whole week kit kats oh

11:04.300 --> 11:10.220
we could do a whole other spin-off show on Kit Kat flavors and we might but anyhow and my new

11:10.220 --> 11:18.460
obsession is Pringles from around the world all right let's talk tonight our kickoff story tonight

11:18.460 --> 11:23.900
we want to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest and you may be thinking like Rob are

11:23.900 --> 11:27.420
you giving preference to one of your favorite games and letting it have the lead topic tonight

11:27.420 --> 11:34.180
partially yes but even if you don't play Final Fantasy 14 please don't tune out completely I

11:34.180 --> 11:38.260
assure you there's a very good reason I'm bringing this up at the top of the show talking about Fan

11:38.260 --> 11:44.260
Fest I'll get to there in a minute so obviously the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest convention is

11:44.340 --> 11:50.460
virtual this year every other year they've done three of them in person they do a Vegas one they

11:50.460 --> 11:56.340
do a Europe one they do a Japan one and it's usually like doing a tour of the latest expansion

11:56.340 --> 12:00.140
announcement obviously because of COVID it was supposed to be in San Diego this year actually

12:00.140 --> 12:04.580
they're gonna move it from Vegas but you know long story short we all know what COVID did to that so

12:04.580 --> 12:10.100
they ended up doing these online events instead so they did that they did a original like keynote

12:10.100 --> 12:15.580
announcement back in February Shane and I co-stream that with some of our buddies that we

12:15.580 --> 12:19.980
play Final Fantasy with here at VOG Network and Shane and I did that last season not last night

12:19.980 --> 12:26.900
Friday night as well is we actually were streaming the keynote event that showed everything else

12:26.900 --> 12:31.180
about this expansion coming up and that was here at VOG Network so for those of you that subscribe

12:31.180 --> 12:37.380
to us here at Twitch on here at VOG Network on Twitch first off thank you second off you can go

12:37.380 --> 12:45.100
back and watch that if you want it is a longer keynote because the translation because they have

12:45.100 --> 12:50.820
to say it in Japanese then they say it in English so you know an hour keynote now is two hours and

12:50.820 --> 12:54.860
even within they were kind of having they were kind of stretching time like you could tell the

12:54.860 --> 12:59.180
parts that you know the audience response would be yeah woo and like screaming and they that was

12:59.180 --> 13:04.540
gone and so it would be these interesting moments of Naoki Yoshida the producer kind of leaning in

13:04.580 --> 13:10.700
and looking at the TV monitors like literally reading chat as he's trying to do the whole

13:10.700 --> 13:16.660
thing you know and and so for what for what it is with the state of the world being that it is

13:16.660 --> 13:22.900
he did his best and I thought it was a he tried and it was it was a good keynote overall and a

13:22.900 --> 13:28.420
lot of the expansion announcements about the game look great as we learned previously Final Fantasy

13:28.420 --> 13:33.780
14 is going to be the latest expansion called Endwalker it seems to have a heavy Final Fantasy

13:33.780 --> 13:39.620
4 influence because we're going to the moon and they are now selling a lunar whale mount in the

13:39.620 --> 13:48.180
game as well as you can get Rosa Edgar and one other one I'm sorry not Edgar edge Rosa edge already

13:48.180 --> 13:53.740
of course you can get I'm in the shop little minions are right now for in the game and there's

13:53.740 --> 13:59.500
pre-order bonuses I think porum is the pre-order bonus and then Palom is in the collectors box I

13:59.580 --> 14:04.900
might have gotten that backwards you know those those of you that really need to know that

14:04.900 --> 14:10.340
information probably already know they gave us the release date though November 23rd that's a

14:10.340 --> 14:14.660
little ways out I think some folks were a little bit like oh that's a bummer we're gonna have to

14:14.660 --> 14:20.420
wait so long but I mean you know the the development of the game was really kind of stopped for four

14:20.420 --> 14:25.620
months during kovat so if you think about it it does make sense so when he as awesome as this

14:25.620 --> 14:32.220
expansion looks it you understand you want it to be done right of course right we hate it when God

14:32.220 --> 14:36.420
they're trying to do it yeah we hate it when game companies release games and there's problems with

14:36.420 --> 14:45.220
them hold that hold that thought it'll be relevant later anyhow oh and I'm gonna have an F you for

14:45.220 --> 14:50.540
the record we'll get there meanwhile let's talk about some other information with obviously 14

14:50.540 --> 14:56.260
and Walker they revealed the other class that will be playable in the game it's it's one of

14:56.260 --> 15:01.260
the things that pains me the most in the world is having to admit when Shane was Shane is right but

15:01.260 --> 15:05.820
damn that boy nailed it like he called that the new class would be the reaper class and it would

15:05.820 --> 15:10.260
have a scythe and sure enough it was the reaper class with a scythe I think the thing he didn't

15:10.260 --> 15:14.300
figure out might be enough to make me play again the thing he didn't figure out was that you get a

15:14.300 --> 15:19.620
little ghost companion when you play it and you kind of like absorb the ghost hugs you it's the

15:19.620 --> 15:24.180
most adorable thing I've ever seen and go look up the reaper trailer dark Sakura on the fantasy

15:24.180 --> 15:28.540
14 channel it's pretty amazing the problem is is that I would have to buy the whole thing on Mac

15:28.540 --> 15:37.580
again yeah that part's a bummer yeah cuz the yeah yeah so but anyway so you you kind of can merge

15:37.580 --> 15:42.740
with the ghost and you do special attacks and that's cool they also unveiled and this was big

15:42.740 --> 15:47.700
for me at the end I was not expecting it and if you go back and watch the feed I was literally

15:47.780 --> 15:52.060
just in a state of shock because I my brain literally did not understand what was happening

15:52.060 --> 15:59.340
when they announced male Viera are coming to the game as the next playable race by God male Viera

15:59.340 --> 16:06.240
the bunny people from Final Fantasy 12 that have always been like Fran was the biggest most well

16:06.240 --> 16:13.380
known Viera and the lore you only ever really saw female Viera I believe male Viera kind of known to

16:13.380 --> 16:18.340
exist but they're not really seen but anyway long story short we're getting them in Final Fantasy 14

16:18.340 --> 16:23.060
I've been a big advocate for this for a long time so I was thrilled and now that I've had time for

16:23.060 --> 16:27.100
like my brain to process at all I am really thrilled with this and absolutely I'll be race

16:27.100 --> 16:32.860
changing to a boy bunny as will lots of people that play Final Fantasy 14 I'm sure so that is

16:32.860 --> 16:37.580
a very exciting announcement and then of course they detailed some new areas in the game and soon

16:37.580 --> 16:41.860
some new things about the story they really detailed the collector's edition they wheeled

16:41.940 --> 16:47.060
it out they have a pin and they have all this other really cool stuff that is coming out so

16:47.060 --> 16:53.380
for the most part that was the keynote now the event continued on throughout the weekend and

16:53.380 --> 16:58.900
they would do some panels talking about like they had one the live letter that kind of gave

16:58.900 --> 17:05.380
a roadmap about what to expect between now and when the end Walker expansion releases like here's

17:05.380 --> 17:11.100
the next story patch here's when we're gonna implement the data center moving which is another

17:11.100 --> 17:16.180
huge thing about and Walker I'm so excited for that for example like Ziba here at vog network I

17:16.180 --> 17:20.540
don't know she's listening live tonight but I know she listens to the show and she's always kind of

17:20.540 --> 17:25.460
said a bummer you know she's on a different data center than I am we can't play together but in

17:25.460 --> 17:30.340
Endwalker or shortly before Endwalker starts we will be able to do that with the data center move

17:30.340 --> 17:36.060
so a temporary move I visit whatever they call it so that is gonna be very exciting and they also

17:36.060 --> 17:41.420
do these big concerts this is the big big you know thing when you're there live the concert is

17:41.420 --> 17:46.740
it man they did like a Friday night piano concert and they do a Saturday night concert with the

17:46.740 --> 17:54.060
primals which is like a rock band that features Soken he's the guy that does all the music for

17:54.060 --> 17:59.180
Final Fantasy 14 he actually like plays guitar and sings a lot of songs and all his band kind of

17:59.180 --> 18:03.820
does that it's really cool unfortunately because the time difference they were doing this in Japan

18:03.820 --> 18:10.740
it was on at like 3 in the morning for us here in the US so I didn't watch it live here's the part

18:10.740 --> 18:17.260
okay perk up because here's the part that is a really big deal and had a lot of people in the

18:17.260 --> 18:24.340
community talking today so they did the concert and after the concert is the closing ceremony but

18:24.340 --> 18:29.860
it was a little bit different what happened is Soken wanted to talk to the crowd that was watching

18:30.060 --> 18:34.340
for a little bit and he basically said you know thank you for your support thank you for everything

18:34.340 --> 18:38.460
you've done this has really helped me get through the year and I'm very sorry I don't have the

18:38.460 --> 18:44.100
official audio I tried to get that working before the show unfortunately it didn't work I tweeted

18:44.100 --> 18:50.260
out that video earlier today if one of our resourceful folks like Tiger Claw or dark Tetsuya

18:50.260 --> 18:54.780
could like pull that video from my tweet from this morning and like post it in chat and maybe the

18:54.780 --> 18:58.780
discord I'd really appreciate it cuz and so that those of you listening on the podcast feed can go

18:58.780 --> 19:04.860
check out on discord this video link um Soken was thanking everybody because he revealed that in

19:04.860 --> 19:13.140
March of 2020 right before the coronavirus pandemic set in he was diagnosed with cancer and he didn't

19:13.140 --> 19:17.700
reveal what type of cancer it was so we don't know those details but what we do know is that

19:17.700 --> 19:25.700
Square Enix and the Final Fantasy 14 team basically allowed him to work while he was in the hospital

19:25.700 --> 19:34.300
and if you've played things like patch 5.3 there's a really big boss fight in that game with a really

19:34.300 --> 19:39.540
epic song in it called to the edge I believe is the name of that song that song was basically

19:39.540 --> 19:45.860
written while he was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and that song if you

19:45.860 --> 19:53.940
listen to it has a huge impact like that like go back and listen to that song again now that you

19:53.940 --> 20:02.500
know that information that is huge Soken's contribution I'm sorry I'm just this is a very

20:02.500 --> 20:07.300
heavy topic we're getting into and I'm just like I actually got choked up watching the video today

20:07.300 --> 20:15.020
and I get choked up thinking about it because you cannot understate the contributions of Soken to

20:15.020 --> 20:22.100
Final Fantasy 14 I have said this on the show before there can be no successor to Nobuo Uematsu

20:22.100 --> 20:26.860
what that man has done for Final Fantasy what that man has done for video game composition and

20:26.860 --> 20:35.140
all of that can can never be replaced however what Soken has done with Final Fantasy 14 and

20:35.140 --> 20:41.500
when you really consider that the project was a realm reborn and all of this the contributions

20:41.500 --> 20:49.580
of Soken he's a worthy successor to Final Fantasy's music and I would assume I don't know I would have

20:49.580 --> 20:54.300
assumed before I heard this news over the weekend that he was probably doing Final Fantasy 16's

20:54.300 --> 21:00.020
music as well this situation I'm not sure if that's the case anymore who knows or any of that

21:00.020 --> 21:09.220
um he didn't tell they did not tell the production team about his cancer because everybody was

21:09.220 --> 21:14.300
working from home so people didn't know so this was the first time a lot of the production team

21:14.300 --> 21:18.780
was finding out about this and so it was it was really heavy because you could hear the story

21:18.780 --> 21:24.940
producer going like I I feel so guilty I was giving you so much work and asking all of these

21:24.940 --> 21:29.780
changes for you when I was going through all this and Soken is basically saying and I am paraphrasing

21:29.780 --> 21:37.660
here like I I am having this to work on having the fans feedback from things like the to the

21:37.660 --> 21:43.500
edge composition having all of this kept me going and that's the part that really gets you choked

21:43.620 --> 21:51.140
up and then something else to consider is that Naoki Ishida who's the producer of the game and

21:51.140 --> 21:55.900
you know a big figure he's the face of the game he's you know the guy that gets out there and does

21:55.900 --> 22:01.740
all these keynotes this entire time that Soken is talking he has his back to the audience and you

22:01.740 --> 22:09.540
can tell he's he's he's breaking up he's tearing up and after about 13 minutes of discussion with

22:09.540 --> 22:15.700
Soken and the team and everything he says I know this is a strange note to end the closing

22:15.700 --> 22:24.700
ceremonies on but I just want to say that I am so happy that my best friend is still here and if you

22:24.700 --> 22:28.900
don't get a little choked up in that moment watching it and again I'm sorry I can't be here

22:28.900 --> 22:34.900
and play it for you guys but it might be triggering to some folks I don't know so if you go and watch

22:34.900 --> 22:42.220
it if you don't get a little choked up hearing that I don't know you've had a different life

22:42.220 --> 22:46.300
experience than I clearly because I had a hard time holding it together this morning watching

22:46.300 --> 22:53.620
that you know when you consider what that this game what this community what this has done for

22:53.620 --> 22:59.020
people and and Yoshida also explains this a little bit with that when he was giving his first speech

22:59.020 --> 23:05.940
to the team when he was rebooting Final Fantasy 14 Soken was one of the first people to jump up

23:05.940 --> 23:11.100
and advocate for him and say let's do this let's go and so you can tell there's a tight friendship

23:11.100 --> 23:18.700
between these two and Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy the franchise is better for it so to hear

23:18.700 --> 23:26.740
that all of this happened and none of us had any idea and the game sure it had a four-month delay

23:26.740 --> 23:32.820
but are any of us gonna complain at this point no we are not because of everything we've heard

23:32.820 --> 23:39.820
that this team is going through and what they're going through personally it's like wow now why is

23:39.820 --> 23:45.740
this relevant to folks who maybe don't play Final Fantasy 14 I mean yes it's a nice story but I tell

23:45.740 --> 23:52.220
you all this and I tell you about what you know Soken is literally pouring his heart and soul into

23:52.220 --> 24:00.020
this game and using this as therapy to get you know to fight what is a horrific battle tell me

24:00.020 --> 24:10.460
video games aren't art people I mean people that have said in the past video games aren't art or

24:10.460 --> 24:17.060
people that mouth we had a story a couple weeks ago about somebody getting mouthy on their cable

24:17.060 --> 24:23.780
talk show about oh twitch is just people watching plate people play video games not stupid I dare

24:23.780 --> 24:28.860
that individual to watch that 13-minute video I watched earlier today fucking look them in the

24:28.860 --> 24:33.580
face and say video games aren't art or the video game community isn't important or video games

24:33.580 --> 24:45.020
don't fucking help people that fucking stereotype is done we've had it I don't know what else to say

24:45.020 --> 24:50.460
that's that and that's why I wanted to bring it up is that like if if you can't listen to this

24:50.460 --> 24:56.700
story and understand that video games are more than video games for a lot of people then you're

24:56.700 --> 25:06.460
never gonna get it period so um Bobby Black Wolf in chat said Shane complained complained initially

25:06.460 --> 25:12.020
but that was in the keynote I not to speak for him but a he's the one that texted me this morning

25:12.020 --> 25:17.340
about all of that that went on and I bet if I asked him again he'd be like oh I get it and he

25:17.340 --> 25:22.540
did kind of like during the keynote he was kind of like oh well you know yeah it's kind of the same

25:22.540 --> 25:27.620
thing I landed I he's he's he's only bummed because it looks so good he wants to play it now but he

25:27.620 --> 25:31.500
gets it I'm sure again I don't want to speak for him but I'm pretty sure he would say something to

25:31.500 --> 25:37.220
the equivalent there fifth dream in chat says yeah Jesus that guy talking about soaking I have

25:37.220 --> 25:43.180
literally hundreds a thousand songs by him on my PC I have all those Final Fantasy 14 blu-ray

25:43.180 --> 25:48.340
soundtracks do yourself a favor folks even if you don't fucking care about MMOs and I get it like

25:48.340 --> 25:54.700
it's monthly fees they're they're tough sometimes even though did you know Final Fantasy 14 is free

25:54.700 --> 25:58.860
to play including the award-winning expansion heavens work this is like a meme at this point

25:58.860 --> 26:04.900
but I'm serious you could check it out the first part for free but you go listen to the soundtracks

26:04.900 --> 26:10.420
at least they're so good and there's so many like ways that they've remixed different songs in the

26:10.420 --> 26:17.180
game and so forth it's it's pretty amazing let's see and sacred J points out it was it was

26:17.180 --> 26:24.180
triggering I had tears yeah I mean it's it's it's very difficult to watch and yeah but I think it

26:24.180 --> 26:29.940
just goes to show that like you know again video games are much bigger than pixels on a screen

26:29.940 --> 26:34.500
that's for sure and especially when you look at a game like Final Fantasy 14 that has such a huge

26:34.500 --> 26:43.060
community as it does it was it was a difficult but also a very beautiful thing to watch so it

26:43.060 --> 26:49.380
just it just makes my heart for that game grow 10 more sizes honestly it really does but if you

26:49.380 --> 26:53.940
if you don't play it and you're not into it that's okay too I'm sure you still agree with my bottom

26:53.940 --> 27:00.900
line and recognize that there's a lot more to this game than a game that's for sure you know I still

27:00.900 --> 27:05.300
listen to the old da theme when I want to chill yeah yeah there's some there's some there's some

27:05.300 --> 27:10.900
great songs for lots of moods in that game at depth says there's some Final Fantasy 14 A Realm

27:10.900 --> 27:15.940
Reborn tracks in theater them that are pretty good yes especially the arcade version has a lot of 14

27:15.940 --> 27:20.980
tracks in them if you're ever lucky enough to play one of those that's for sure so all right so that's

27:20.980 --> 27:26.580
why I wanted to talk about the beginning of the show video games more than just pixels all right

27:27.460 --> 27:35.220
and kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team for being vulnerable for one and just a well-done fan fest

27:35.220 --> 27:40.500
even if even if I was a little critical that it was moving a little bit slow I give them a break

27:40.500 --> 27:46.420
because they were expecting it to be in front of a crowd and it wasn't it's gonna be awkward it's

27:46.420 --> 27:53.460
okay I'm excited to play the expansion very very very much and listening to all of the music that

27:53.460 --> 27:59.060
Soken makes for that expansion and he's they I believe they said chat please correct me if

27:59.060 --> 28:07.220
I'm wrong I believe he did say it is in remission um so um I I so uh yeah that's that does does

28:07.220 --> 28:13.540
have a happy note there okay um moving on let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the

28:13.540 --> 28:17.620
types of video games and and maybe some gaming things off the screen too that we've been into

28:17.620 --> 28:23.700
this week uh Dark Soccer I'll start with you well I'm starting off with anger but I'll get to the

28:23.700 --> 28:29.940
anger in a little bit so um of course I've been playing some Animal Crossing and uh my friend

28:29.940 --> 28:37.940
Mika who has been in chat before is also playing so I gave her about 30 to 40 DIYs of which six

28:37.940 --> 28:45.220
remained since you just started playing um thank you for helping to clear out my recycle bin um

28:45.460 --> 28:50.980
I also am doing and I don't know if a lot of people know about this but on the Nintendo online

28:50.980 --> 28:59.060
app for your smartphone um if you go into that and then open up nook link you can redeem or you

28:59.060 --> 29:07.540
can like earn points and they have six was six yeah six items that you can redeem at different

29:07.780 --> 29:15.780
uh at different price points but uh there's like switch cases and a a door placard that looks like

29:15.780 --> 29:22.340
the leaf but um three of the items are photographs and one of them is Isabel one is nook and the

29:22.340 --> 29:35.780
other are the nooklings they they really boost your uh uh AHH or AHA whatever HHA score the

29:35.780 --> 29:41.940
happy home academy yes happy home academy um and then of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight

29:41.940 --> 29:47.620
because I haven't gotten the freaking gnome yet and I played a lot but I had a funny experience

29:47.620 --> 29:52.660
and I do have to talk about this because it was hilarious so um I was in Hawkins which used to be

29:52.660 --> 29:58.100
one of my least favorite maps and I guess the guys I was playing I guess realized I was you know

29:58.100 --> 30:04.420
fairly new you know I was doing okay but I think that they were giving me looping practice because

30:04.420 --> 30:10.580
they would wait for me and then point and then they would run the loop and I just follow along

30:10.580 --> 30:17.380
and then they let me 4k nice how random is that though like that never happens usually people are

30:17.380 --> 30:22.500
assholes it's it's interesting the way that people and this is in general for all games we're talking

30:22.500 --> 30:27.940
about just dead by daylight in this instance but isn't it interesting how people can communicate

30:27.940 --> 30:32.980
without communicating uh because I had a very similar sort of thing except I was the survivor

30:33.300 --> 30:38.260
and for the record they were all console so I couldn't chat them oh bummer um I had a very

30:38.260 --> 30:43.220
similar circumstance where I was the survivor and there was a nurse in the match and I was like

30:43.220 --> 30:48.180
I was being chased by the nurse and the nurse wasn't using blink and I was kind of like this

30:48.180 --> 30:53.860
isn't normal like what's going on I thought it must be a baby nurse oh my gosh so I would just

30:53.860 --> 30:57.780
I did things like I just started booping the nurse like I would turn around and look at the nurse and

30:57.780 --> 31:03.140
I booped the nurse into which response she'd hit me once but she would she didn't hit me twice

31:03.860 --> 31:10.660
yeah so I so that was the communication to me oh she's here to farm so finally and without

31:10.660 --> 31:15.460
communicating because again I was with randos we figured out this nurse wants to farm and so we

31:15.460 --> 31:20.180
were doing healings we're letting the nurse hit us and all this stuff and then we left the match

31:20.180 --> 31:25.780
pretty much helping each other out and left well uh dark soccer we were all on steam so we could

31:25.780 --> 31:34.980
chat and the killer was like gg I have a daily to chase for 180 seconds as nurse yeah what the

31:34.980 --> 31:40.420
fuck quest is that thanks for letting me get it and I was the one that ran him because I was like

31:40.420 --> 31:44.260
why is this nurse chasing me and not using blink and I'm thinking in my head oh well I'm just gonna

31:44.260 --> 31:48.980
keep running and like practicing doing that little did I know I helped him beat his quest and I had

31:48.980 --> 31:56.900
that as a generic yeah so it's um so I had to do that on plague yeah yeah so it was just uh

31:56.900 --> 32:00.900
interesting so communicating without communicating anyway sorry sorry to derail your daily week but

32:00.900 --> 32:05.700
I really like that although there are times where if I do get somebody in chat I'm just gonna flat

32:05.700 --> 32:11.300
out say you know if they're being little troll assholes I'll be like real mature and then I'll

32:11.300 --> 32:17.620
just leave because don't care um usually I'm playing the plague so I can blood vomit on them

32:17.620 --> 32:22.500
so that it forces them to leave the match anyway um so this is the thing I'm pissed about

32:23.700 --> 32:32.820
so I did all of my reading up on the windows arm environment I am on a mac mini m1 I need it for

32:32.820 --> 32:38.820
the majority of the work that I'm going to do I can game on it just fine except that you know

32:38.820 --> 32:46.900
I installed parallels I got the windows arm beta up the developer's beta so I could have the

32:46.900 --> 32:56.020
increased uh emulation and it won't run mass effect and I have paid for mass effect so I have

32:56.020 --> 33:05.300
a uh a kvm switch arriving tomorrow and um I'm going to hook up uh my my pc again the old dinosaur

33:06.020 --> 33:16.260
so that I can steam link on my mac okay yeah um and I think it's gonna be okay

33:16.260 --> 33:25.700
it's just I then have to figure out another cord or cable to get I'm just I'm not happy about it

33:26.420 --> 33:35.220
and I know that they are still working on the x86 emulation um for windows arm and I'm pretty

33:35.220 --> 33:42.020
positive that you know it's not going to be too long away and I'm not the most super hurried about

33:42.020 --> 33:49.860
it I guess because I have played them ad nauseum at the same time I need my space bird husband

33:51.940 --> 34:00.500
I need I need the voice of garris to just read the phone book to me yeah the struggle read the

34:00.500 --> 34:05.620
presidium directory thank you garris well I hope you're able to um get that figured out or the you

34:05.620 --> 34:09.540
know the emulation kind of pulls through I mean I get it's a newer game and it's really pushing the

34:09.540 --> 34:13.460
boundaries of graphics and stuff so there's a part of me that kind of gets it but I also

34:13.460 --> 34:17.380
understand how it's frustrating but it is isn't it nice that we have you know now that cloud and

34:17.380 --> 34:22.180
streaming technology again jamie you've given more cases for why that stuff is a good thing

34:22.180 --> 34:26.420
here on the show than any of us like you know you play dead by daylight on stadia you do you know

34:26.420 --> 34:31.940
and uh it's it's interesting to hear how you're using this cloud technology to your benefit in

34:31.940 --> 34:37.300
these different ways well and I'm really I'm really happy about it I mean right now the only

34:37.300 --> 34:46.100
thing that I I would need uh my pc for is just for for mass effect and if I wanted to play dead

34:46.100 --> 34:53.300
by daylight on on steam I'm going to log into dead by daylight on my pc just long enough to link my

34:53.300 --> 35:01.540
steam account to it yeah so that my purchases will transfer yeah smart um but I mean I I'm still

35:01.540 --> 35:06.740
considering keeping parallels uh and keeping her to run the windows arm because I can now play hot

35:06.740 --> 35:13.860
a full boyfriend again um but a lot of the other games that I'm playing are available on mac like

35:13.860 --> 35:23.780
uh I still have to play uh uh the second edition of uh homestuck hive bent um you know which uh

35:23.780 --> 35:29.060
I've just been putting that off and I'm probably gonna stream that too but other than that I'm

35:29.060 --> 35:36.500
also playing fantasion which uh I'm moving into I've moved it to Tuesdays to do my weekly you know

35:36.500 --> 35:46.420
chapter so my goal is to get through like a story segment every time I play nice and so I'm really

35:46.420 --> 35:52.340
pleased with that and then I've also just discovered a lot of other streamers um and uh I'm really

35:52.340 --> 35:57.700
really happy about that and uh pod culture asked me if g-force now would work for me um probably

35:57.700 --> 36:05.860
because that's how um amethyst rose witch plays but it doesn't have mass effect don't so again

36:06.500 --> 36:12.980
because it's because it's steam linked through origin yeah and so that's where the

36:12.980 --> 36:16.820
ea probably wants to do their own thing eventually whenever they get around to it so

36:16.820 --> 36:22.820
right right um I mean if ea puts out a streaming service then heck yeah I'll be able to you know

36:22.820 --> 36:28.980
the the thing is that it's still probably need to play some sort of uh copy on my computer so

36:28.980 --> 36:34.020
that I can mod the shit out of it later well maybe maybe as some xcloud and microsoft's technology

36:34.020 --> 36:38.020
moves along that might actually be a good thing for ea because we know that ea play

36:38.020 --> 36:42.740
and xbox game pass have an agreement together so that could that could mean something I it's

36:42.740 --> 36:47.540
I'm hypothesizing but maybe when microsoft's cloud technology launches publicly that's going to be a

36:47.540 --> 36:54.180
good thing well and you know what I've saved I have saved all of my character save files from

36:54.180 --> 36:59.220
the earlier mass effects they work but not well not one they did change the save file format for

36:59.220 --> 37:03.780
one but two and three will work that's what I heard yeah but what this means is that when I

37:03.780 --> 37:09.620
start making a save file for one I can use the gibbed editor and change the way my shepherd looks

37:09.620 --> 37:15.540
nice so well you know that's always kind of fun for me you're gonna the the thing you need in

37:15.540 --> 37:19.780
mass effect legendary dish or you you've won it the photo mode that's all you need there's a photo

37:19.780 --> 37:25.300
mode now you're gonna have a field day oh well you realize I was doing that anyway with fly cam oh

37:25.300 --> 37:28.260
no I know I know that's why I'm like you're gonna have a field day because now it's built in

37:28.900 --> 37:33.940
and everyone when I'm playing again look forward to the return of mass effecting

37:33.940 --> 37:41.940
it will happen I might do it on tumblr I might do it on twitter it it it remains to be seen but

37:42.820 --> 37:47.140
I've had people poking me already because I mean I got like over 10,000 followers on

37:47.700 --> 37:53.060
tumblr for mass effecting nice so we'll see all right I didn't mean to go off about that and I

37:53.060 --> 37:58.420
will never do tick tock just saying all right uh let's move on to loki loki we barely heard from

37:58.420 --> 38:05.460
you tonight how was your gaming week it's been all minecraft surprise no um so I've been just

38:05.460 --> 38:12.580
more progress on the server that I'm on um dill haven't put out the second episode yet but I've

38:12.580 --> 38:16.740
got a lot of footage I have to go through my my problem is I'm stuck in this kind of bad habit

38:16.740 --> 38:22.660
where I keep doing stuff in the game and keep recording it but not editing that all down so

38:22.980 --> 38:26.900
I need to find a good stopping point and then right now kind of the stuff I'm doing has more

38:26.900 --> 38:33.220
of an episode three type stuff but it's been lots of building farms and debugging stuff I've built

38:33.220 --> 38:38.980
a piglin bartering farm but the problem with is the normal design where you can separate them by

38:38.980 --> 38:46.820
one block because the server I'm on they have a dropped item entity reduction thing to help with

38:46.820 --> 38:51.620
lag and so what happens is when you drop stuff too close together it kind of clumps together

38:52.180 --> 38:59.940
and so that broke what I have with my farm so I had to um I have eight piglins right now to trade

38:59.940 --> 39:05.860
with but I had to drop that down the four so every other one um in order to space them out enough and

39:05.860 --> 39:09.620
I have to figure out I'm going to do the other four probably move them around or something

39:09.620 --> 39:14.580
but that's what I've been working on it's a lot of work it's all of this like farm stuff just to

39:15.220 --> 39:20.820
get the supplies I need to actually do more of the creative stuff um and then there's also the

39:20.820 --> 39:25.700
way I plan for episode three is building like an actual shop in the shopping district so I've been

39:25.700 --> 39:32.020
working on getting it all together I have a design done for it um just supply gathering right now so

39:32.020 --> 39:37.620
that's what I'm doing with the the farms I have um and then outside of that a little bit of orna

39:37.620 --> 39:44.740
um that's pretty much been it it's it's the same old stuff um sacred jade in chat is asking what

39:44.740 --> 39:49.300
game is playing behind you tonight live on twitch you've got an interesting looking 16-bit game is

39:49.940 --> 39:57.860
that is it is ghoul patrol that is the sequel to uh zombies ate my neighbors that I don't think

39:57.860 --> 40:02.420
ever came out over here um but that's also something that we're I think it's one of the

40:02.420 --> 40:06.740
stories we're talking relevant it is it's relevant to pay attention all right I have never played

40:06.740 --> 40:13.940
this one but yeah it's uh I like the first one all right we'll talk more about that later meanwhile

40:13.940 --> 40:19.940
my gaming week um so I've been continuing in dragon quest builders 2 um you I'm still in the

40:19.940 --> 40:24.740
first area like my gosh there's there's a lot to this game I don't know if I'm gonna get through it

40:24.740 --> 40:28.740
um I I really don't know if I'm gonna get through it with other stuff that's released now but I I've

40:28.740 --> 40:33.860
been continuing on in that uh playing a little more final fantasy 14 uh thanks to fan fest and

40:33.860 --> 40:37.780
there's a special moogle tome event going on in the game right now so I'm really motivated to

40:37.780 --> 40:42.020
get back in there and do my roulettes and stuff again so um there's that and then I'm still

40:42.020 --> 40:46.580
playing dead by daylight myself as well working on killer and survivor unfortunately I got to

40:46.580 --> 40:51.140
this point where like I've gotten my killer up to you know like rank 12 or 11 which you'd think

40:51.140 --> 40:56.260
would be a good thing but it actually is really annoying because I there's a lot of killers I'm

40:56.260 --> 41:01.460
still working on I have no talents with and uh when I get matched up with players survive I get

41:01.460 --> 41:06.580
survivor squads that just bully me and I can't do anything because I don't have the talents to

41:06.580 --> 41:10.420
really go up against them the matchmaking in the game is really screwed up right now and I really

41:10.420 --> 41:14.660
wish they'd work on that and then this whole thing with the rank reset went totally I didn't

41:14.660 --> 41:20.900
even get rank reset so that and some people got like people at high ranks got reset all the way

41:20.900 --> 41:25.460
down to like the lowest ranks and like that I don't know why that stuff was happening but yeah

41:25.460 --> 41:30.740
behavior I really they need to work on that bugs aside I'm still at least having fun with the game

41:30.740 --> 41:36.740
at least I don't give a shit about my rank I really don't and at least the blood points and

41:36.740 --> 41:41.860
development of your character always goes forward never backwards so there's that so even if I lose

41:41.860 --> 41:46.580
a game horrifically I still get some blood points and I can develop my character and that's what I

41:46.580 --> 41:52.660
really want so there's that um and so those are all uh the the ones you'd expect me to talk about

41:52.660 --> 41:56.740
that I've talked about a lot of weeks and then of course there's the big one so like dark soccer

41:56.740 --> 42:02.500
talked about um I am a huge fan of mass effect and I've talked about that ad nauseum on this program

42:02.500 --> 42:07.540
so it is no surprise whatsoever um that I picked up mass effect legendary edition as well this week

42:07.540 --> 42:13.780
and I've picked it up uh yes and I I decided to pick it up on xbox one or xbox series x as the

42:13.780 --> 42:21.140
case may be um uh that's where I first played the trilogy uh was on xbox 360 and I was like you

42:21.140 --> 42:26.580
know I want to have a nice little plop on the couch and play through game I I want to I want

42:26.580 --> 42:31.540
to play through the game this way and so that's what I did um I bought the physical version

42:31.540 --> 42:37.780
because I heard that the digital version was like 120 gigabytes and I'm thinking in the back of my

42:37.780 --> 42:42.420
mind I don't have the bandwidth for that right now like we we went over our bandwidth cap last week I

42:42.420 --> 42:46.660
can't and Alan's gonna play this too and I'm pretty sure he did do the digital so we really

42:46.660 --> 42:51.780
don't have the bandwidth for this right now so I'm like I'll get the physical and uh that'll work um

42:52.980 --> 42:59.700
I gotta say I love the mass effect trilogy it's one of my favorite trilogies or honestly favorite

42:59.700 --> 43:04.420
game series that's ever happened um having played the game a little bit I love what they've done to

43:04.420 --> 43:10.100
the original mass effect it looks a lot better um the Mako stuff doesn't annoy the shit out of

43:10.100 --> 43:16.260
you it's it's usable um there's a there's a lot of fun that being said if you haven't picked up

43:16.260 --> 43:23.380
the mass effect legendary edition I don't know if you should get it right now uh and that might

43:23.380 --> 43:31.700
surprise you but unfortunately there are some problems and unfortunately this is a fucking

43:31.700 --> 43:38.580
trend with BioWare games lately and EA games lately and unfortunately I've hit my breaking

43:38.580 --> 43:45.060
point with this shit and that is there's there's too many bugs I don't know if the game should have

43:45.060 --> 43:49.300
been released I don't think it was necessarily 100% ready and I'm going to talk about the

43:49.300 --> 43:54.100
biggest bug that's annoying the shit out of me it crashed my xbox which you know whatever of

43:54.100 --> 43:58.900
course that's going to go right after an important part of the game it crashed thankfully it auto

43:58.900 --> 44:03.460
saves a lot I didn't lose too much progress but that was annoying and dark soccer will talk about

44:03.460 --> 44:07.700
some of the other reports coming in about bugs and things like that later on in the show but

44:07.700 --> 44:10.740
I'm going to tell you the thing that's pissed me off more than anything and it might seem like a

44:10.740 --> 44:17.540
little thing but I and I don't know if this is just me being 40 so I'm going full Karen in this

44:17.540 --> 44:24.980
moment or whatever it is but I I fucking had it with this and this is the companies and the the

44:24.980 --> 44:31.940
internet companies and the gaming companies not figuring shit out when it comes to bandwidth caps

44:31.940 --> 44:38.500
and us losing as a result of that and I'm gonna this is exactly what it is so the xbox version

44:38.500 --> 44:44.580
of the game comes with two discs one is labeled disc one that says uh play disc the other one's

44:44.580 --> 44:49.780
labeled disc two which is installation disc I want to stress the xbox disc and the playstation

44:49.780 --> 44:55.780
discs are not labeled the same okay so when you go to xbox here's what I did I put in disc one

44:55.780 --> 45:00.500
of course because why wouldn't I I put in disc one to fire up the game okay I'm gonna install mass

45:00.500 --> 45:08.100
effect one and uh then uh it installed mass effect one and it downloaded an 11 gig update

45:08.980 --> 45:14.820
uh fine all right games need updates whatever 11 gigs worth I don't know okay I thought I thought

45:14.820 --> 45:20.500
a patch actually just patched files like actually just substituted the parts 11 but I don't know

45:20.500 --> 45:25.940
enough about programming I guess I shouldn't talk so 11 gigs then I'm like you know what while I'm

45:25.940 --> 45:30.340
here since I've installed the first game why don't I just install the other two games because I'm

45:30.340 --> 45:35.380
gonna play them eventually so I go to mass effect 2 I hit install and it props up on the screen and

45:35.460 --> 45:41.140
says we're gonna download 36 gigs press ok to continue whoa whoa wait what what

45:41.140 --> 45:48.100
you're gonna download 36 gigs for mass effect 2 what is this other what is this other disc

45:48.100 --> 45:52.900
okay maybe it's mass effect 3 let's go to mass effect 3 I'm gonna download 38 gigs what what

45:54.340 --> 46:01.300
what's this other disc sake okay let me um all right maybe I was maybe I need to oh I'll launch

46:01.300 --> 46:07.780
the game from the second disc that'll that'll fix it so I put in the second sorry you need the

46:07.780 --> 46:14.260
first disc to start this game okay all right so I put in the first disc maybe I need a disc swap I

46:14.260 --> 46:20.820
eject the first disc I'm kicked out to the xbox menu long story short that second disc doesn't do

46:20.820 --> 46:30.260
a goddamn thing what is it well from sleuthing around online what I have learned is if you keep

46:30.260 --> 46:37.780
yourself offline when you initially install the game you will use that data disc as your second

46:37.780 --> 46:44.820
and third install for mass effect 2 and 3 and then you can patch them but if that's stupid if

46:44.820 --> 46:50.340
you're at the point where I'm at where you've already installed the first game and so I thought

46:50.340 --> 46:55.780
oh okay I'll put myself in I shouldn't have to do this but I'll put myself in offline mode trick it

46:55.780 --> 47:00.180
into thinking I don't have the internet then I can install from the disc and guess what nope the game

47:00.180 --> 47:06.100
crashes because it can't figure out that it can't download the game because that initial patch I

47:06.100 --> 47:14.420
downloaded apparently patched out the ability to install from the discs unacceptable and I'm sorry

47:14.420 --> 47:22.900
if I've blown your ears out but I am so fucking mad this is so ridiculous that this is happening

47:22.900 --> 47:29.620
like is it really that hard and I admit I don't know shit when it comes to programming games is

47:29.620 --> 47:35.940
it really that hard to just have an option when you hit install that says download install from

47:35.940 --> 47:42.500
disk it doesn't Loki you've made a game does that sound difficult what I'm asking for no and also I

47:42.500 --> 47:47.300
don't understand why you wouldn't just install from the disc and not I get it downloading a

47:47.300 --> 47:51.460
patch but like you would think that you would try to conserve I mean if you cared about your

47:51.460 --> 47:55.140
customers you try to conserve their bandwidth as much as possible especially when we're talking

47:55.300 --> 47:59.780
large downloads thank you this is and you know what I know there's going to be some people out

47:59.780 --> 48:04.180
there that's like Rob is throwing a fit over something ridiculous and I warned you in the

48:04.180 --> 48:11.620
beginning I admit this is like a little but it's I've hit my fucking breaking point I need the

48:11.620 --> 48:18.100
gaming companies and the the cable companies to fucking figure out this bandwidth issue and I need

48:18.100 --> 48:27.700
gaming companies specifically EA Electronic Arts and BioWare I need them to figure and honestly

48:27.700 --> 48:31.620
let's say Activision as well because I know they're guilty of this shit with Call of Duty

48:31.620 --> 48:36.020
and I don't even play it you guys need to figure out this fucking patching problem these day one

48:36.020 --> 48:41.860
patches these 70 80 gig patches because we don't have the fucking bandwidth for it and I'm at the

48:41.860 --> 48:46.420
point where I'm not going to buy games anymore if I hear that there is these gigantic fucking

48:46.420 --> 48:51.140
patches on day one because apparently the game is just fucking broken to begin with

48:52.500 --> 49:00.420
like it's it's I I my mind is blown that there's a second disc and it doesn't do anything now at

49:00.420 --> 49:06.100
this point and of course I've I've tried to do the Twitter thing where I've to nicely mind you

49:06.100 --> 49:11.620
much nicer than I am now tweeting EA help Xbox support BioWare Mass Effect tweeting everybody

49:11.620 --> 49:15.700
saying uh does this is this too not supposed to do anything am I doing something wrong what's

49:15.700 --> 49:20.340
going on nothing of course not I'm just some jackass on Twitter they're not going to respond

49:20.340 --> 49:26.980
to me who cares but I know I'm not the only one facing this issue and it's just and there's a lot

49:26.980 --> 49:31.060
of people out there who don't care because they're like oh I've got unlimited bandwidth or oh I love

49:31.060 --> 49:35.300
Mass Effect so much whatever I'm just going to take the 30 gig hit or whatever but like

49:35.860 --> 49:42.980
as time goes on and as these you know things go on with COVID and and all this stuff like these

49:42.980 --> 49:50.740
bandwidth issues are getting worse and worse so what am I what am and what so I dropped 60 bucks

49:50.740 --> 49:58.340
on the game I I I opted to I could have actually gotten the game cheaper digitally because of the

49:58.340 --> 50:03.620
Xbox game pass agreement and that whole thing with EA I could have actually gotten the game

50:03.620 --> 50:08.980
cheaper I could have gotten it for like 52 dollars that way but I actually opted to pay the 60

50:08.980 --> 50:14.020
dollars so that I wouldn't have to worry about the bandwidth thing and this is what happens

50:17.700 --> 50:24.740
I also want to stress this is one example of things that are wrong with the game again the

50:24.740 --> 50:30.340
game crashed on the as series x as I was playing through it later on Dark Soccer is going to bring

50:30.340 --> 50:34.420
up some other stuff later that I know is affecting PCs and some people that are in some similar

50:34.420 --> 50:44.100
issues what's like I've hit I'm sorry I'm just speechless because I in my mind I've hit this

50:44.100 --> 50:50.500
point where suddenly some of these things we've laughed at and called frivolous lawsuits no longer

50:50.500 --> 50:58.260
feel frivolous to me I want EA and Activision to be held accountable for this unnecessary shit that

50:58.260 --> 51:05.220
hits my bandwidth I really do because I don't know what else is going to stop this trend

51:10.660 --> 51:15.060
and I don't know it's not gonna they're not gonna do anything until it hits them financially

51:15.060 --> 51:21.940
exactly exactly it's not gonna hit them financially so they're never gonna stop and it's

51:21.940 --> 51:26.660
more like it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was like if the internet companies weren't the way

51:26.660 --> 51:32.900
that they are and maybe and maybe that's what has and maybe that's what has to give in this

51:32.900 --> 51:37.620
situation I don't know but it's still kind of weird though like you would think though that

51:37.620 --> 51:41.300
it would prior illing because even like just not even necessarily bandwidth but like you're

51:41.300 --> 51:47.060
unnecessarily like making people wait to download something and then install it when you have the

51:47.060 --> 51:50.900
data on the disk that you just purchased why wouldn't you just use that I would think that

51:50.980 --> 51:58.340
would even just be faster like I don't understand what the point is just just so I'm clear also

51:58.340 --> 52:02.980
this does appear to be and somebody in chat if you know definitively can correct me from

52:02.980 --> 52:09.460
this does appear to be an issue that is unique to Xbox because the PlayStation 5 discs

52:10.260 --> 52:17.060
disc the one disc is labeled put me in first installation disc and then the other one is the

52:17.060 --> 52:25.220
play disc oh yeah it's still fresh and honestly the way and that's just the way the PlayStation

52:25.220 --> 52:29.860
5 is built with the whole backwards compatibility thing and the Xbox is built and for most

52:29.860 --> 52:34.900
circumstances Xbox has kind of had the better backwards compatibility system but in this one

52:34.900 --> 52:40.500
very specific case unfortunately it's it's it's fucked things up with the whole patch and

52:40.500 --> 52:47.860
everything yeah E3VL is in chat saying second disc just launcher on Xbox second disc does

52:47.860 --> 52:54.740
nothing but tell you to put in disc one believe me guys I've tried this every way you can think of

52:54.740 --> 52:59.460
BioWare needs to put out a patch that allows you to install from the disc instead of automatically

52:59.460 --> 53:06.980
going to the internet the disc I paid for that now does nothing to to do that and I I could

53:06.980 --> 53:16.260
uninstall the 11 gigs I just did and start from scratch but that's I don't even know if that would

53:16.260 --> 53:24.100
be a guarantee to work though number one and number two I shouldn't fucking have to and I've

53:24.100 --> 53:31.940
had it so as much as I you know now that I've got and I've played Mass Effect and I've just you know

53:31.940 --> 53:37.300
grinned and bared it through some of the crashes things like that and it's it's a great it's a

53:37.300 --> 53:44.580
great remaster and you know what Mass Effect Andromeda had a lot of great shit in it and what

53:44.580 --> 53:53.060
ruined it stupid shit that was rushed out too quick and that is why do I want to say it I'm

53:53.060 --> 53:57.300
gonna say it this clip this is gonna haunt me so this is somebody's gonna clip this it's gonna

53:57.300 --> 54:03.780
fucking haunt me I don't care this is why I am not buying the next Mass Effect game day one

54:05.620 --> 54:06.420
I'm not gonna do it

54:08.900 --> 54:13.940
this happened with the legendary edition this happened with Mass Effect Andromeda

54:13.940 --> 54:18.660
this really happened with Anthem did this happen with Dragon Age Inquisition Dark Sakura I don't

54:18.660 --> 54:24.900
remember not really Dragon Age Inquisition worked fine from day one okay yay so more more of that

54:24.980 --> 54:30.820
when I started playing it I didn't notice a problem and less of your track records

54:30.820 --> 54:37.860
you've recently developed under EA I've had it well and they also need to have arm support just

54:37.860 --> 54:46.820
saying I I'm not gonna play the new Mass Effect because I know it's gonna get patched after a

54:46.820 --> 54:53.540
month or two there's gonna be problems when it first releases and I'm putting my foot down this

54:53.620 --> 55:00.100
is one of my favorite franchises ever and I really want to support the team and I am so sorry to the

55:00.100 --> 55:05.140
team and I'm so sorry to the people that this affects when they have nothing to do with it

55:05.940 --> 55:16.660
but I've had it period going to chat quest buster says I can echo dark soccer on Inquisition it

55:16.660 --> 55:20.100
installed and worked right from the start for me too okay great let's have more of that then

55:20.100 --> 55:25.780
great but unfortunately I just named three in a row that are that are a little busted let's see

55:26.980 --> 55:34.020
uh let's see RHM087 in chat says relatively small potatoes but I'm a little salty the switch card

55:34.020 --> 55:40.820
for Starlink Battle for Atlas requires an update of around 10 gigs out of the box yes not a fair

55:40.820 --> 55:47.860
comparison since switch cards can't hold as much data as a blu-ray okay that doesn't discount your

55:47.860 --> 55:53.780
point and what you're saying though is that this is an industry-wide problem it really is

55:53.780 --> 56:01.540
like we have to do something about this day one 80 gig patch culture this is enough is enough

56:01.540 --> 56:08.420
like okay a small a couple of gigs to patch things you know okay but this is too much this has to

56:08.420 --> 56:13.060
stop and gamers gamers have to be willing to speak with their wallets and have to be willing

56:13.060 --> 56:18.500
to forego some things their heart really wants to give him on and that's why I said what I said

56:18.500 --> 56:23.700
about the next Mass Effect game when it releases in what 2024 2025 whenever it is and that's why

56:23.700 --> 56:28.980
I'm like I'm probably gonna regret saying that because it's so far out but I've had it I've had

56:28.980 --> 56:36.980
it so Bobby Blackwolf we were talking at the end of your show I said you might want to wait now

56:36.980 --> 56:42.260
you know why because it's the same thing you might as well wait till they patch the crashing is the

56:42.260 --> 56:48.260
trilogy will be great and the trilogy will still be there and I know the industry lives and dies

56:48.260 --> 56:52.420
on you know how much a game sells in its first week but that is something that's going to need

56:52.420 --> 56:56.740
to change too because I'm sick and fucking tired of buying games in the first week to have this

56:56.740 --> 57:06.900
shit happen and going back to the comment on what RHM said Nintendo is about the only company

57:07.780 --> 57:15.700
I trust to do this right I may get proven wrong in the future but Nintendo is about the only

57:15.700 --> 57:19.620
company that's doing it right so I think I'll continue to buy Nintendo games the day they

57:19.620 --> 57:25.060
come out but everybody else can go fuck themselves until they figure this out all right unless it's

57:25.060 --> 57:32.100
a Dragon Age game no oh no I won't be buying Dragon Age day one either trust I I am well

57:32.100 --> 57:36.260
and that's that's fine I'm not telling anyone else they have to do anything I'm saying I've had it

57:37.140 --> 57:43.220
and I'll buy Dragon Age once I hear once I get the validation it's fine it works you know it's it's

57:43.220 --> 57:48.820
okay well and you know me any of those games I don't play on console anyway yeah I know and a

57:48.820 --> 57:53.700
lot of there have been a lot of people saying that that a lot of people playing on Steam are having

57:53.700 --> 58:00.420
an okay time of it yeah but what again if you get past all this bullshit like I said there's a great

58:00.420 --> 58:05.620
game in there just like just like Dark Soccer just like Mass Effect Andromeda it was a great game it

58:05.620 --> 58:11.780
got ruined it got ruined by all this bullshit and it's it I feel like the guy in Twin Peaks

58:11.780 --> 58:17.300
and the Red Lodge sitting there going or sorry the Black Lodge going it's happening again it is

58:17.300 --> 58:26.500
happening again I I am gonna say my Andromeda worked perfectly as well from day one so all

58:26.500 --> 58:30.820
right I've been very preachy I'm sorry there's gonna be people that are like Rob's too preachy

58:30.980 --> 58:36.340
I have feelings okay I just think that we should also bear in mind that for some people your

58:36.340 --> 58:42.580
mileage may vary yes that is true and um and maybe maybe you don't give a shit because you

58:42.580 --> 58:47.140
have unlimited bandwidth good for you good for you know because I would like to know what part

58:47.140 --> 58:54.260
of the world well they would like to be a part of that world they live in I installed 96 gigabytes

58:54.260 --> 58:59.860
on my virtual machine and there's a very good play there's a very good chance folks in the northeast

58:59.860 --> 59:06.420
who have Comcast haven't had because uh Comcast ended up pushing back that bandwidth cap thing

59:06.420 --> 59:11.300
until next year because they were under pressure with coronavirus and everything that's great for

59:11.300 --> 59:17.140
the northeast love you guys but what the fuck about the rest of us and this and my anger

59:17.700 --> 59:24.180
is just as much directed to cable internet providers and the fact that in many parts of

59:24.180 --> 59:29.540
the country we don't have choice on so we're stuck with a lot of this stuff especially in this you

59:29.540 --> 59:35.380
know very internet tuned in age where that cap hasn't really changed I think they might have

59:35.380 --> 59:40.260
said oh we bumped it up 10 percent big fucking deal I have some suggestions for you offline

59:40.260 --> 59:45.540
yeah I know well there's some other things but we'll talk offline about that so anyway

59:45.540 --> 59:50.900
all right um I've preached enough I'm sorry but I have I had feelings I got something to say

59:51.780 --> 59:56.420
I do actually have something that I want to bring up if that's okay just a quick thing

59:56.420 --> 01:00:01.060
yes I'm sorry I'm just now looking at I was so preachy I wasn't looking at my watch go ahead

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:07.780
Darcyra it's all right so um oh hi Renee Renee's in chat who I haven't seen in a long time me neither

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:15.300
um but um as everyone knows I'm from Alabama and we've uh talked to uh my mama son before

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:25.380
she sang a song for us um well one of uh one of her roommates that there's you know uh my mama

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:32.660
son my papa son uh another friend and then uh uh another friend who's actually been mama son's

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:41.380
best friend for a long time um but she is in hospital on a ventilator due to pneumonia and

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:48.580
covid and um I would just like some good vibes if y'all don't mind just some good vibes to

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:56.660
send uh k kitty's way I'm very sorry to hear that yeah she's she's my best an amazing person

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:03.060
you know she's one of those people that's better than she thinks she is so good vibes please and

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:09.140
please please get vaccinated please like yes yes like I know people that the vaccines are

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.780
experimental no the mr mrna stuff's been researched for years and if you've ever

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:19.380
taken a flu shot there's a new one of those every year as well so guess what like the the

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:25.780
vaccine's been around long enough like like just get the vaccine just all right yeah well and

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:35.300
thankfully I mean the rollout for vaccines in Alabama has been atrocious um thankfully finally

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:40.820
somebody in that house is vaccinated or on the way to being vaccinated my mother still hasn't

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:50.260
been she's like I can't find a place to do it and so wow I'm really disappointed I'm I'm and that's

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:56.420
I'm glad to hear a mild word knowing your mom and knowing um because I it blows my mind the vaccines

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.300
have become a political issue and that is so frustrating but knowing that your mom has a

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:05.860
certain stance when it comes to politics I'm really glad to hear and this is something I'm

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:10.100
hearing more and more which I'm very thankful is that people's parents as their kids are like

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.860
fuck yeah I'm getting vaccinated people's parents are kind of like coming around a little bit so

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:19.860
like I'm I'm really happy to hear that I'm sorry about the fact she can't find one right now but

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:27.700
I'm really happy to hear that she's open to getting one yeah um and I'm I'm trying to do a little bit

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:36.500
of you know digging uh on her behalf and uh I I don't know it's just I'm really worried and this

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.820
one hits really close to home because if I was still in Alabama who knows what state I'd be in

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:49.380
sure sure yeah so again it goes back to seriousness um and if I remember correctly I think she's

01:02:50.340 --> 01:03:00.580
in her late 50s I think this friend of mine so just be get vaccinated get your friends and

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:11.940
parents and whoever harp on them so just do it um because I know I'm going to be heartbroken

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:18.340
if if I lose my friend all right well I I really really hope she comes around so fingers not to be

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:26.420
a bummer no it's it's it's one of those nights here at OLR sorry we have feelings yeah I'm just

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:31.700
laughing at a just because I don't know what other expression to have right now um anyway

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.420
uh I will say you know what the nice thing about being vaccinated um you know uh Allen and I are

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:41.140
both he got a shot uh his second shot and he's he's through the motions where he's fully vaccinated

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.660
I'm fully vaccinated we actually went to a small gathering of uh also other vaccinated people last

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:52.020
night probably like eight people I know in the area it felt so good you guys it's been like a

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.340
year and a half and it's like the extrovert in me was like you know and we were only there for like

01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.980
an hour because it was a chance thing we went out to dinner downtown and it was like a friend

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.580
messaged and said you should come over and we like fuck yeah we will everybody's vaxxed right yep

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:12.580
okay let's do it so um it felt so good so I'm it's like it's a taste of what the other side can look

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:18.980
like if people will just please please get the vaccine all right I ran into a friend after I

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:28.420
was almost past my uh second vaccine and uh uh and he had been vaccinated and I just and we

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:34.340
just both went screw it and gave each other a hug and it's one of the first non-friend hugs I have

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:43.060
had in almost two years um Bobby Black Wolfenchat says and I can also explain to you why Costco

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.860
asking if you're vaccinated is not a HIPAA violation that is correct that is not a HIPAA

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.580
violation and as somebody who worked in the healthcare industry for 18 years and designed

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:57.780
HIPAA training for a company with thousands of employees that took the HIPAA training I will

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:03.380
stress to you HIPAA has to do with information and how it is conveyed from one health insurance

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:08.100
entity or I'm sorry excuse me a covered entity which means a healthcare provider or a healthcare

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:14.900
clearinghouse anybody handing handling healthcare data to another it has nothing to do with um

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:19.780
disclosures personal disclosure your own personal disclosures you can that me telling you I got

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:25.220
vaccinated that's not a fucking HIPAA violation because that's me disclosing it to you and Costco

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.580
asking that question to you is not a HIPAA violation because they're not doing anything

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.540
with your health insurance information that's a question they're asking you so you can get

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.100
through the door that is their policy and they have the right to set it as when I was a massage

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.140
therapist I also had to adhere to HIPAA which basically meant that some third party could not

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:48.340
come to me and ask about someone's medical conditions we signed the document I did not

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:57.860
disclose it basically HIPAA is a huge NDA on a personal level yeah one could argue that if Costco

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:03.060
then told what you said to somebody else then they would be violating HIPAA but actually Costco is not

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:09.460
really they they're not a they're not storing your data so it's a very different situation but anyway

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.060
we can get into the nuances if you'd like but I'd rather talk about video games right now

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:20.260
get my mind off of this all right let's talk HIPAA nuances no no we've had enough off topic tonight

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.220
all right let's get into past seven o'clock and not even on our first fucking story so Loki

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:32.500
please all right so uh I don't know this isn't really much of a shock I think but Sony is saying

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.940
that they expect that the PlayStation 5 shortage is going to continue into next year the reason

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:45.780
for that is the continuing chip shortage and the um the demand still staying quite high through

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:56.260
2021 so basically the financial chief officer uh Hiroki uh Toki basically said that um I don't

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:00.500
think the demand is coming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:07.220
more units of PlayStation 5 next year our supply won't be able to catch up with demand so continue

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:18.020
to expect um ridiculous queues and scalpers yay but I mean to be fair I mean not a lot of games

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:23.780
coming out like I don't know it I still wonder when some of these first party like really big

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.820
titles are coming out there I mean Returnal came out I guess recently but like more of

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:35.620
system seller type things like I haven't yet seen anything necessarily that I needed to have day one

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:40.740
even with the series x which I did get you know at launch there wasn't really anything that's like

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:47.860
oh my god I gotta get this system because of this right now yeah so I I'll have to wait and see um

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.340
She-Hulk 10 in chat is uh saying it's not a chip shortage they just don't want to pay more for the

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:57.700
chips yeah they don't want to their loss is only so much that they're willing to lose it no it's

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:03.860
still it's still a shortage because being that the supply is low that the demand is high that

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.980
the prices go up so it's still technically a shortage it's just that you know they don't want

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:16.020
to pay the the inflated price because of the shortage but you know you hopefully you know with

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:23.140
maybe the interest in cryptocurrency I don't know if it's waning it's still pretty popular um but I

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:29.940
know there's just a lot of demand right now so maybe that we'll see more factories you know or

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.580
I don't know if it's necessarily the you know the manufacturing of it or the actual silicon that's

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:40.740
you know in short supply but I guess we'll have to wait and see if it calms down sounds very 80s

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:46.420
Nintendo I'm I'm really glad and I'm not gonna usually hype up what this guy says at all but I

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:53.060
am gonna give my polite golf clap to um Elon Musk who's been quite the face of a lot of this

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.380
cryptocurrency stuff at least he's been using his platform to kind of say in these past few days

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.060
hey we need to look at something that's more green and that's something that's not like using

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.580
so damn much energy when it comes to this cryptocurrency stuff so I will give one round

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:10.580
of polite applause to at least folks that have a voice to be able to um realize that something's

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:15.460
got to change with all that craziness uh when it and look I'm guilty of it too I've gotten in on

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:20.900
the cryptocurrency thing just a little bit uh but I don't mind it you know I I've been basically

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:28.020
legalized gambling with it uh is is what it is so uh just tell them to stop putting brain uh

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.980
chips and pig heads and chickens and all that yeah anyway anyway um but back to the PlayStation

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.620
issue um I will say uh you know I'm bummed because yeah I'd like to pick up a PlayStation 5

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.140
especially with Returnal I've been watching friends play that and stream it and it looks

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.020
like a lot of fun and a type of game I'd be into it looks really cool but I like I just I'm like

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.060
I'm not gonna fight scalpers and all this stuff there's still that part of me it's like I will

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.460
get a PlayStation when I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf that then I'll know

01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:01.300
it's for me um I don't really want to play these fucking games now if Final Fantasy 16 releases

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:06.500
this year I reserve the right to change my tune but I don't think it will and I don't think I will

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.020
so um but we'll see we'll see I'm not I'm not gonna say it as definitively as I said the other

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.420
thing I'm gonna regret um but if I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf I'll be

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:23.220
happy to do that um let's see uh Pele Hanumea in chat says whichever system had 20 million

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:27.700
consoles ready at launch could have won the console wars this gen easily that was always

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:34.660
going to be hard during COVID and even though COVID is declining as we're seeing it in the

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.860
states as more people are getting vaccinated I hope everybody realizes a lot of your gaming

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.700
consoles don't come from the states they come from other places where maybe COVID vaccinations

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:51.060
aren't getting around as much as well so yes COVID is still an issue even if it is an issue

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:58.980
in your house right now so um yeah anyhow um okay let's move on and talk a little bit about Xbox

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:04.260
because this is one of those things about Xbox as much as I've advocated for them uh on the program

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.220
this is one of those things that kind of didn't make sense and I'm kind of glad that they're going

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.340
to be addressing this and that is with the quick review uh resume excuse me quick resume feature

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:17.780
that's the one that allows you to like pick up a game and go which by the way also crashed my mass

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:24.980
effect game earlier today but I said I'd move on um the quick resume future is uh allows you to

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.860
pick up a game without a lot of loading time or waiting and kind of flip from one thing to another

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:36.180
um but it's hard to tell like what games are actually in the system's memory right now and

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:41.300
what's been pushed out well the good news is uh the quick resume feature is going to be getting

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:47.620
a little bit of a facelift with the upcoming Xbox update this month so you can see what games do you

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:54.260
currently have suspended on your series x or series s depending on what you're using um that's

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:58.820
going to be nice uh especially as more and more games are supposed to be supporting it as well

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:05.780
um they say uh in a announcement you will be able to list all the games currently saved in quick

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:10.580
resume and you can also pin that thing on your dashboard so you can get to that quickly which

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:16.420
is kind of cool as well uh on a somewhat related note uh Microsoft also released some new themes

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:23.220
uh with Xbox one uh excuse me well Xbox one and series x uh including a like anniversary background

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:28.260
that lets you uh kind of relive what the old school Xbox look like and uh it's kind of a neat

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:32.980
theme I also really like green so um I've been using that theme lately which is um kind of fun

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:41.620
so all right moving on dark sakura I I promised we'd get to this I I've been staring happily at

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:49.620
this picture of garris for a little while because he's space husband so basically um with the mass

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:54.820
effect legendary edition launch um of course people are having issues you know you spoke of

01:12:54.820 --> 01:13:01.300
your own um but uh a few people are already encountering just some other in-game problems

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:08.900
uh one user on uh in a thread on reddit says happens walking around on citadel and spontaneously

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:15.780
when interacting to talk with npcs the game just disappears but I can hear the sound and task

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:22.100
manager it is not responding and I have to force quit and reload um other people are saying that

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:29.220
they're experiencing the same thing um several are saying that they're unable to uh launch the game

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.540
um and then they have like the the boot going in circles um

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:43.860
trying to you know like origin isn't even loading um and you know I wonder if some of that might be

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:49.460
why mine's not playing in compatibility mode but then again like I said uh I did by the

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:58.020
let's doing the same thing um on steam itself um it'll it'll get to the first boot and then

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:06.660
trying to launch the origin client it crashes um but there's other options that people are missing

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:17.060
as well so um it only supports the combat and interactive gameplay in 21.9 the cut scenes though

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:26.420
all go back to 16.9 using uh pillar boxes um the aspect ratio basically this one I like the term

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:35.620
for this they're saying it gives a sense of visual whiplash um and no one has made anything about it

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:41.780
um there's no graphical options no forced mouse acceleration no field of view slider

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:50.180
pillar box ultra wide um so yeah people are just talking about mods and patches to fix the port so

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:59.540
I'm I'm kind of glad that I'm not gonna play it yet um and I'm actually just watching like a little

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:10.500
video of people going through this so um I hear myself echoing anyway um at any rate though I think

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:21.700
that uh there's a lot for them to fix we're gonna see more more patches and I mean I wouldn't be

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.900
surprised that even if this is something that's on purpose that there's gonna be something up on

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:33.540
nexus to change it too I mean I don't know if these people are playing full screen or playing

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:39.220
windowed or what have you I mean there's a reason why I typically play my games windowed anyway

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:47.300
I get a little bit less of of that uh that massive change but even so I mean I'm on an

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:51.300
ultra wide screen monitor what's gonna happen when I try to play it you know

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:58.900
hopefully the modders have fixed the game since apparently it wasn't totally done I I don't know

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:04.660
it's just it's and and here's the bummer here's the real bummer especially when I'm talking to

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:11.060
people like bobby who is like I've always been I'm paraphrasing what I'm hearing um but bobby's

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.700
like you know I the way you guys talk about mass effect all the fucking time maybe there's

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.780
something I'm missing maybe I ought to pick this up maybe I ought to play this legendary edition

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:27.620
now that it's in 4k and it's pretty and I hate I hate to say give it like three months because

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:33.700
he may not be interested in three months and he may mean you know but but the reality is is that

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:37.860
it's unfortunately I think it's gonna take a little while for them to get these problems

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:43.460
fixed and it's just like one of those bummers where it's like I wish they would have had it

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.900
right on day one and I'm not telling people wait three months for them to do all the patches that

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:56.420
will definitively fix the game well see and now I want to go back on my uh my virtual computer and

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:04.020
try to load the first mass effect um but I mean when I was playing through mass effect two and

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:11.620
three um because I think they were easier to mod those two I had basically super high res

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:24.580
mods that would work in 1080 right and I I don't see how like what did they reprogram it's the same

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:30.100
engine they boosted graphics pretty much I mean they might have I mean the the first one of course

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:38.020
was revamped to work on that engine but I don't really I don't really get it you know well they

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:42.660
went in under the hood and did stuff to combat and the Mako so I mean I think they did more

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:51.060
with that one than two and three but yeah but yeah but I don't know it's just I I guess I'm

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:59.060
having a hard time phrasing what I want to say I it makes my heart hurt it's just it's just

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:03.860
disappointment because we know there is a good game in there and we know this shouldn't be

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:13.460
happening but it does and it's it's frustrating to put it lightly it's like it's like when you're

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:20.740
served like a layered casserole and the top layer is like half cooked turnips but underneath that

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:25.780
you got some lamb you got some chicken and some cheese or something you just need to

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:34.340
get past the turnips what was that trifle with beef and potatoes all right let's move on to the

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:44.100
next story which I think Loki's talking about yeah so Target has decided to post where they're

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:51.220
discontinuing selling Pokemon cards at their physical locations right now and this is

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:56.260
including actually a lot of different type of collector cards because they've had issues with

01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:01.460
grown adults fighting each other in parking lots trying to get some of these more sought after

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.900
packs so apparently the restriction kicked in earlier this week they're going to no longer

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:14.660
sell the NFL, NBA, MLB, and Pokemon cards except online you can order them through their online

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:19.860
stores they just don't want you coming to their locations and having altercations in the parking

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:27.220
lot because you really wanted you know some foil card or something like that so it's grown adults

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:32.740
I mean what are you gonna do but yeah that's I think they're not the only store too I think

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:39.220
Walmart's also been cracking down on selling stuff as well so it's just can we just please

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:46.340
act like adults please I mean come on act Efton chat says the summary to the story FU scalpers

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:52.660
and E3VL in chat says scalpers need to keep themselves in check Quest Buster says this is

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.780
why we can't have nice things and Tiger Claw says it's because those cards have gone up in value

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:03.620
all of that yeah like it's the scalping culture I bet a lot of those people fighting over cards

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:07.780
are just going to flip them online and so they see it as money and people trying to steal their

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:13.860
money and when people try to steal money they want to fight about it and this is probably where

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:20.580
a lot of the scalping stuff has to get fixed too and ebay and facebook markets and all these things

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.180
really need to come together to figure out what they're going to do about scalping but you know

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:31.140
of course others will say well there's not a lot you can do um one thing I do like though what was

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.420
it there was a store I bought something on recently and it had I think it was actually

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:42.820
Square Enix when I bought the expansion for Endwalker actually um who's who's who's getting

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.660
a lot of praise from me tonight for doing things right and this is another one I wasn't even

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:52.580
planning but I bought the expansion and it actually texted me a code to my phone because

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.420
it was just kind of like we just need to um check this order I don't know what it was actually

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.140
checking behind the scenes or whatever but it texted me a code and I had to put in that code

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:08.420
but I noticed by doing that it also is making sure that I have a number in the region that I'm trying

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:14.740
to buy the game in uh that I'm only getting one that I'm one person and it also kind of slows

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:20.580
things down because I have to put in this code and all this stuff so I would love to see more

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.140
retailers kind of do this force two-factor verification which kind of slows the process

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.820
of buying things down so it's hard to do and yes I know there will be some people that are still

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.740
probably able to find a way around it and so forth but it will really cut down their their speed of

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:40.740
that sort of thing I think so uh ZenMonkey11 says they can't stop it it's the culture only the fans

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:47.140
can stop it and uh you know there there is there is very much truth in the fact that if this wanted

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:52.580
to end tomorrow it could if everybody could just agree to not buy from scalpers anymore

01:21:53.540 --> 01:22:00.340
but unfortunately there's some people that are going to do whatever they want to get their kid

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:06.580
their damn Pokemon card um and that's another part of our culture that's kind of disappointing

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:14.020
I guess uh yeah Tiger Claw says the problem is eBay is enabling all this I agree but they're

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:18.340
making money off of it this might be a thing where the government has to step in and regulate

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:23.060
it or at least do that thing where they threaten if you don't fix this problem we will that's what

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:27.780
I'd like to see happen if you don't fix this problem we will you're starting to see a little

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:32.020
bit of that because I do believe the current administration or congress one of the two maybe

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:40.420
both kind of have said that this whole chip shortage stuff this is an issue fix it so there

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:48.340
you see it's starting to go that direction so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on talk

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:53.620
about something that's happy and wonderful and that is the upcoming 35th anniversary of Dragon

01:22:53.620 --> 01:23:00.180
Quest did you know that series is 35 years old that's exciting and depressing all at once because

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.620
I don't know about you guys but I have fond memories of playing the first game when it first

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.780
came out in America anyway when it was Dragon Warrior and I know we got it a little later but

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:13.300
still you know it wasn't wasn't that long after and uh yeah 35 years Dragon Quest will be doing

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:19.220
a special 35th anniversary stream on May 26 to celebrate it and they're going to be giving all

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:24.660
the latest information on the latest Dragon Quest games so you know keep in mind there's like a

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:29.060
Dragon Quest cell phone game uh they're I think they did a Dragon Quest version of theater them

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:34.660
at one point in Japan only I don't know but the one that has everybody excited there may maybe

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:38.980
there'll be a builders 3 that would be pretty exciting actually but the real thing that has

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:44.820
people excited is that could this be a Dragon Quest 12 and there's strong hints that this is

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:50.420
going to be an announcement of Dragon Quest 12 of course the last game in the series was uh Dragon

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.540
Quest 11 uh but that's been out for a little while you know to the point that we're getting these

01:23:55.540 --> 01:24:02.660
like enhanced of definitive edition re-releases on Xbox when you know it was out on the the switch

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:09.300
in Japan and uh the the PlayStation 4 in both regions for quite some time so I'm expecting

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.140
that we're going to hear what console the new Dragon Quest game is for if that's going to be

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:18.020
a Switch thing as well uh or what they're going if they're going to do Xbox parody as well who knows

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:24.900
uh we're going to hear all of that hopefully uh at this stream on um I said 26th of May but

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:33.780
actually I'm hearing the event starts at on May 28th at 8 30 pacific time so maybe is there two

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:37.540
of it I think maybe it's just a typo in this story because I'm looking at a big graphic that says

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:45.140
May 26th is when this is all happening so um look forward to some news in that capacity um

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:50.260
Dr Tetsuya in chat says I did finally get around to finishing Dragon Quest 11 this last year yeah

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:55.380
you know the Xbox release made me take another look at it so that was fun now if that's not

01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:00.180
enough for you how about some Dragon Quest in the real world did you know there is a

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:05.460
Dragon Quest island that is going to be opening actually it opened yesterday uh this is the

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:13.380
Nijigen no Mori amusement park uh that has this attraction it's this little Dragon Quest land

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:20.660
um I guess you it's there's interesting pricing tiers to this uh and then you know some different

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:25.140
rides and things uh with all this it's been delayed a little bit because of COVID-19

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:31.060
but it did finally open so fun I'd love to visit someday um but probably not going to be anytime

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:39.860
soon all right Dark Sakura what do you have for us um I have some stuff about PlayStation and Steam

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:49.380
so PlayStation's Steam page is live and there's actually something that's listing number first of

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:58.180
all it lists 41 pieces of content but only about half of it is visible so that's 41 games and their

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:07.220
DLC associated with the Sony division but there's only 24 things that you can see so um the only ones

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:15.060
available to purchase right now is horizon uh horizon zero dawn predator hunting grounds and

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:26.260
hell divers um days gone is set to release later in the month but um they uh they're saying that

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:30.980
they want a lot more to come out they have a whole bunch of games coming out and it looks like the

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.940
evidence for it was there it's just this stuff isn't there to see yet I think we've got you know

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.620
hidden placeholders or something yeah it's interesting that there's like you know this is

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:44.820
going to this level of where they have like their own branded page and stuff and I know um there

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:49.700
wasn't as much juicy news out of that court thing this week but one thing we did get it from the

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:55.140
court thing last week was uh the whole news about that PlayStation it had a conversation with Steam

01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.420
and and this looks to be something uh that that could be a result of that I'm sure there were

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:05.460
other things discussed too but definitely it seems to be there's um a tighter partnership there and

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:13.860
so that's interesting yeah so all right well I think Loki has some more PlayStation things

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.700
yeah so this is exciting I'm always trying to figure out what you know they're going to be

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:26.900
doing for PlayStation VR too and here's some more like kind of from a reliable source type of thing

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:33.940
so Uploaded VR had done a kind of a piece talking about the technology that's going to be

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:40.820
in the next PlayStation VR so some of that including foveted rendering which for those

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:46.580
who don't know it's using eye tracking to render just the highest resolution image

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.420
where you're directly looking and then everything around that would be lower resolution and then as

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:58.260
you change where you're looking at it would actually alter where it's rendering the highest

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:03.300
you know resolution part of that image so it allows it to save some bandwidth being able to

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.740
just render um a smaller section of the screen at a higher resolution with everything else being

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:14.820
a little bit less um in focus I guess uh they're saying that that sounds like straight up science

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:21.540
fiction that's crazy yeah it's pretty crazy um they had the uh there's gonna be an IPD adjustment

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:26.500
dial which is kind of uh typical with a lot of the headsets out there uh per eye resolution they're

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:32.660
saying is uh 2,000 by 2040 pixels um they're doing the inside out tracking kind of like the

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:38.500
most modern um headsets out there right now uh also they're saying that they're going to have

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:43.300
the haptic feedback which I assume is going to be the same type of stuff that we had um with the

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:50.580
DualSense 4 controllers so uh I'm sorry they're new uh controllers that they have that have that

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.500
enhanced haptic feedback I'm assuming those are going to be in the new controllers that they

01:28:54.500 --> 01:29:02.020
put out images for not too long ago um it's still going to be a wired headset which is fine but

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:07.140
being that technology has gotten a lot better than what it was with the original PlayStation VR

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:15.700
it's just one USB type-c cable I believe which I think that's pretty manageable um what else that

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:24.580
we don't know when it's coming out yet of course not of course not and uh you know haven't really

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:31.300
seen anything confirmed yet these are just you know like I said you know from a reliable source

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:36.820
right now so it's all rumors and speculation until we actually get some news from Sony but

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:43.060
maybe this year maybe we'll find out I'm assuming some next year maybe yeah I would be shocked if

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:48.740
PSVR is a thing for this year I really especially in light of the continuing supply issues and

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:54.340
things like that um I think it'd be really wild to try to put out a VR unit when you can't put

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:59.540
out enough consoles to meet the demand so I I would say for that reason alone PlayStation VR

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:06.500
for PlayStation 5 has to be at least another year out um but I I don't make sure bets on anything

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:15.860
anymore exactly well I mean it's just it sounds cool I hope all that's true now um some interesting

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:21.300
perspective in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network uh Bobby Blackwolf our pal uh

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:29.380
in chat is saying um that uh I'm very interested in seeing how this will work with my astigmatism

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:35.140
which means my eyes jiggle a lot I haven't tried any eye tracking headsets yet and you know what

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:39.940
Bobby uh is talking about there that's not exactly an uncommon thing there's a there's quite a few

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:46.980
people out there with astigmatism uh that uh I deal with it yeah and so so what's gonna happen

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:52.020
you know is there a way to turn this feature off that Loki's talking about or is it gonna

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:56.660
compensate for that somehow or I I don't know because I don't develop this stuff um but it'd be

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.980
some of those accessibility type of things are very interesting questions

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:06.740
especially when we're talking about new technology with VR I mean I I hope everybody gets to enjoy

01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:11.700
it I would assume though it's very fast I mean assuming that most of these a lot of the newer

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:18.100
headsets you know render at about 120 megahertz I mean that's that's pretty fast I think that's

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:23.540
a lot faster than your eye can move so I would assume that assuming that the eye tracking is

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:28.020
that good and it would have to be if it's you know putting the rendering or it's basing the

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:33.860
rendering where you're looking um that's going to be interesting it's also going to be interesting

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:38.500
that they sell that data and use you know advertisements like oh let's we can now measure

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.980
advertising your advertisement engagement and stuff like that yeah that's pretty dicey there's

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:48.820
lots of evil yeah uh evil possibilities Bobby in chat says you don't know how fast my eyes can move

01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:54.420
against my will well I will say this I I look to Bobby to be a voice on this because I know he's a

01:31:54.420 --> 01:32:00.100
huge VR enthusiast he talks a lot about it on his show he works a lot with VR stuff um so so I know

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:06.020
I'm going to get the answer from Bobby uh when uh the PS gets closer to release and I imagine you

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.700
know I don't think they're going to talk about any of this on a big stage but I imagine they will

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:14.020
address some of the stuff behind the scenes when it comes to things like accessibility and what

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:20.900
about this what about that you know um it'll be it'll be interesting to see so all right well let

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:24.820
us move on and I'm going to talk a little bit about speaking of announcement type of things

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:31.700
uh EA Play uh you know they usually do a thing uh it kind of concurrently with e3 because e3's

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.780
changed a lot and I'm not just talking about the COVID thing but you know EA started doing their

01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:40.180
own thing across the street and EA is going to be continuing to do its own thing this year and

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:46.660
what's interesting to me is that it's a little ways out it's on July 22nd this time so it's not

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:52.020
exactly when e3 is happening which um you know there there's probably great reasons for that

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:56.660
probably so they can you know have every additional day to work on trailers and things like that so

01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:02.420
we'll see um I also think it's interesting they really invoke their old school logo

01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:07.700
back when they were eca of the square the sphere and the triangle if you didn't know

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.660
that dates all the way back to eca and what the the loading screen would look like on old games

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.860
but anyway just a little tangent there uh they did announce it's coming back on july 22nd of course

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:22.900
we have no idea what it's going to cover or what games are going to talk about but you know you can

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:28.660
assume uh new games and all their big sports franchises that's for sure um probably an update

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:32.900
on dragon age quite frankly I think it's a high time to get some more on that maybe that'll

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:38.420
actually be a thing this year I don't know um but regardless uh there's going to be a part of me

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.620
that's skeptical about everything they announce because I'm going to be like oh is it really ready

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:45.700
or are they just going to put it out uh before it's done um but we'll see we can make our own

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:53.300
judgments in July all right let's let's go back to a simpler time you guys let's take a step back

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:58.980
and we're going to visit you know this is a time when you had to get it right the first time because

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:04.100
your game was burned to a cartridge and unable to be patched really until years and years and

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:08.180
years later now we have that technology but not back then uh it's the classic game of the week

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:13.060
and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:19.860
should be checking this game out uh and this this I gotta say dark soccer it's I did I didn't know

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.900
this game that you picked tonight this is a pretty obscure one for me maybe I did I just picked

01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:31.940
something that people might not have heard of um it's not even like the best game but it's it's

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.900
neat I'll say it's it's different it's different so anyway but please let's get to it so the classic

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:42.660
game of the week is called Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch um because there's an ellipsis so I had

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:51.700
to pause so at any rate um it is a video game that came out for game boy and the SNES in 1993

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:59.060
um it actually is another one of those games that didn't come out in Japan it's a side-scrolling

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:04.740
platform game about a French chef collecting ingredients for his dishes by going to different

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:11.940
countries to catch them since they have escaped um I'll go into other editions of that but it came

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:22.340
out in November 1993 in the U.S. and September 93 in Europe so it was uh European first um and

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:30.900
I don't think we got the game boy version in the U.S. we uh I think it was only um only in Europe

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:41.460
but um in 1994 it did get a release on the Amiga and the Amiga CD32 so it's it's kind of a

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:50.740
who who knows these games right um so at any rate um there is a single-player mode and a two-player

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:58.100
alternating mode so either way you play as Pierre Le Chef and you have to capture a certain number

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:03.860
of your ingredients before your time runs out so kind of like a little bubble bobbly you know

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:10.980
um the way that the levels are set up so you know you jump from platforms around and you have to

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:17.940
capture everything and you know you've got some you know you have basically you can set them on

01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:25.940
fire too which is pretty fun um anyway though uh you uh you have to catch them in a net and

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:31.860
put them into a cage in the level and then in every level though you have to find the net

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.980
first before you can catch something so once you have all of your ingredients then you get a door

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:46.900
that pops up to the next level you will encounter some baddies including germs and bacteria where

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:52.500
if you get touched by them you lose your life the bacteria can also turn your ingredients into

01:36:52.500 --> 01:37:02.500
hostile enemies so you have to watch out for spoiled food hehe and then there's also the

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:11.060
uh arch nemesis chef chef le noir um who will uh show up to hinder your process

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:18.500
um you can also get weapons like uh hot sauce and bags of flour you can use to

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:25.220
stun your ingredients and the bacteria so you have to basically take him all the way

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:31.700
through uh various places um Switzerland Greece Jamaica of course in this game is known as West

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:39.300
Indies um Mexico China and then France you have eight levels you have to navigate through in each

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.580
country and at the end of each country you can play a bonus game where you can get more points

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:49.700
for extra lives so once you lose all your lives or complete the game then you're given a final

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.980
scorecard that says how many points you got throughout the game and then you get a high

01:37:54.980 --> 01:38:05.060
square ranking so there's not much out for like big reviews on this one um like uh game rankings

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:15.700
gave this a 59.5 um but you know it's cute and I thought you know as much as we love our our bubble

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:21.780
bobbles and various games as such this really makes me think of it but like a little bit of

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:28.020
mappy thrown in and just I mean it's a fun little unique platformer I thought

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:37.060
um and and again it's one of those games that had the distinction of being a fully uh western

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:44.100
release the music was giving me um adventure island vibes too kind of yeah yeah apparently

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:50.900
the um Amiga CD 32 version looks really good but I mean I think we're looking at the SNES version

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:57.460
we are yeah and it's don't look half bad it looks like early SNES you know because it kind of is

01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:01.700
but it kind of looks like a port of an Amiga game which is what I find interesting about

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:06.820
this selection is that there weren't a ton of Super Nintendo games like this but um ironically

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:11.220
one you've picked recently Lost Vikings is another one that gives me that vibe where you can kind of

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:17.220
tell it's a computer game ported for the Super Nintendo um SimCity is strangely an example of

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:24.260
that but not not as much because SimCity had that Nintendo flair thrown in as well um but anyhow I

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:29.460
digress well another one about this is that the company Mindscape uh actually started off as an

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:39.140
American company and then uh was acquired by a French owner so it's now um located in uh

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:47.940
um it so it's a French this game is actually a French developed uh uh game they did like the

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:55.380
the MacVenture series Moonstone uh Warhammer Shadow of the Horned Rat a few a few uh

01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:01.540
Warhammer and Lego Island so it's pretty it's just pretty interesting you know I

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:08.340
it's something that I've noticed though is that European developed games in general like during

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:15.860
the 16-bit era had the same kind of look and feel for the most part maybe that's what it is

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:21.700
it's not so much a PC you know equivalent or Amiga equivalent um but it's the European well

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:27.300
Commodore was so huge in Europe that an Amiga port almost kind of goes hand in hand anyway I

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.860
digress again sorry but I was just thinking maybe this is more like you can just kind of tell it's a

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:37.780
Europe uh kind of developed game well my other thing too is that you know the only thing that

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:41.460
doesn't make this distinctly European is that there's no dropping water to kill you

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:52.100
but anyway um so yeah it's a cute game um like the again you'll see it as out to lunch but the

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:58.340
full name of it is Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch I wonder does anybody in chat have memories of

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:02.180
this game because you know I did not know this game but when I was looking for the video the

01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:06.180
b-roll of it and yeah you'll have a easier time kind of finding information on it if you look

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:11.540
for out to lunch as opposed to the full name um but uh I saw like a lot of YouTube comments that

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:16.580
were like oh I love this game when I was a kid or this you know so even if something has a low

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.300
you know Metacritic score or whatever there's just certain games that are always going to take us

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:26.420
back you know like there are games that didn't review well on Metacritic that I love um the NES

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:32.900
port of Ultima Exodus is a great example um it doesn't review well at all but I have huge memories

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:39.540
of that game there's always gonna be a special place friend who had this oh cute and we would we

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:44.580
would do the the two-player mode I mean I really didn't play it a whole lot but I had seen this pop

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:52.100
up not too terribly long ago and I was like oh that game was cute I sucked at it um and so I decided

01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:59.780
to throw it in because it's you know the the Nintendo library in and of itself for Super

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:07.060
Nintendo is bigger than you think it is oh yeah um and I like to find just these little things that

01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:14.580
might have flown under your own radar and say hey you know yeah bust out that retron or or the 400

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:21.220
you might have paid for the analog um a bobby black wolf is in chat and being a little bit

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:27.140
tongue-in-cheek or sassy asking some questions here such as it says I have questions such as

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:31.700
what causes these foods to escape why are we only sending a chef after these sentient foods

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:36.580
what happens if these escaped foods spend too much time in the sun and why do we not air drop

01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:40.660
the chef into this war zone without a net is it Billy Mitchell hot sauce I think talking about

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:46.020
one of the foods there does it's on-site requisition and what does the BurgerTime

01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:50.500
universe think of this development of more sentient foods that's it's it's hard to not

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:55.860
make the BurgerTime comparison when looking at this game about you know chef fighting bad food

01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:59.940
for sure you know you know what I think of every time I see the little eggs rolling is I think of

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:07.060
weebl and bob remember back when I used to do the website of the month oh yeah that was back in the

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:14.420
day that was before your little uh facts you had the facts on the early days of the podcast

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.900
I don't know if that was a life lesson or whatever that was yeah yeah maybe I should start giving out

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:24.900
life advice again but this time I should charge for it um but but anyway I okay so the big rocks

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:30.020
are truffles this is definitely a French game anyway um they look like rocks but I always just

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.900
call them rocks like why is it eating rocks but they're truffles um but the eggs make me think

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:40.020
of weebl and bob which I did review the uh the website and actually one of the the folks that

01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:48.500
works on it you know reached out to to us so um but yeah the eggs make me think of uh of bob rolling

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:55.780
in little nice all right so there it is your classic game of the week out to lunch or um

01:43:55.780 --> 01:44:02.980
the full name one more time um Pierre le chef is out to lunch all right thank you very much great

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:08.100
pick all right it's fun to learn about new games sometimes too even years and years after the fact

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:14.340
all right yeah the truffle also kind of looks like a big poo all right let's uh travel around the

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:18.980
world and quickly check out some rapid fire news and some quick headlines loki will start with you

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:26.660
yeah so as you can see in my background here um ghoul patrol and zombies ate me neighbors uh that's

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:33.220
a brand new uh collection that's going to be released now on uh playstation 4 xbox one switch

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:42.180
and pc june 29th coming thanks to uh limited run games um they're also going to be doing a uh

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:49.620
physical version of that a little bit later on as well um if you can find that and then um yeah so

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:55.620
it's going to be coming with the two games so one of which i've only played i don't know too much

01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:00.660
about google patrol other than it looks kind of similar um they're also adding art collection

01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:05.780
soundtrack developer interviews and plus they're going to have trophies and achievements and stuff

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:12.500
like that local co-op so uh 14.99 is what that's gonna run you so it looks awesome can't wait to

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:17.140
get that a nice surprise because these are really some cult fate like the zombies ate my neighbors

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:21.380
is like a cult favorite i'm sure dark soccer picked it as a classic game at one point because

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:26.340
it's or maybe you did when she wasn't here one week but but uh it's really a cult favorite of

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:30.180
uh type of game and uh it's great to see it getting a re-release and some attention again

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:37.380
yeah and so there's always been a lot of uh rom hacks out there and one the more um i guess

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:42.980
popular ones for uh smash is smash remix which is the rom hack of the original smash brothers game

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:49.140
for the nintendo 64 um they've added lots of new characters to the game and the latest character

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:57.140
that they added in there is conquer from conqueror's bad fur day also they have um looks like

01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:02.980
wolf O'Donnell is also in there as well so uh pretty cool to see that in the newest update

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:08.980
but yeah it's kind of funny seeing conquer with a chainsaw in a smash brothers game but

01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:13.060
i would i would do down for seeing that in a uh modern smash game as well

01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:21.620
all right dark soccer what do you have for us well um you know evercade is a cool little

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:29.780
device and their uh their launch lineup has a few people scratching their heads um so of course

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:38.500
they have some traditional stuff like namco museum coming out um but other two that have been listed

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:47.700
recently the uh jalico collection one and the pico collection two um they are pretty classic

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:53.220
but i think you have to kind of stop and think about what you might have played in those series

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:58.500
like for example the uh the jalico one has the original earth defense force unrelated to the

01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:05.700
current ones base is loaded a styonax city connection rival turf um and then the pico

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:15.060
one has things like soccer kid and shut up and jam so it's it's got some craziness on there so

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:24.500
if you like those family of games and certainly check it out and then uh sony has new uh ps5

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:32.340
dual sense controllers that they have announced a fied um and i just made up that word so you can

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:40.660
get uh these galaxy inspired colors one of them is midnight black and cosmic red and honestly

01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:45.460
they both look pretty sweet although the red one kind of looks like a bathing suit i just bought

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:55.380
um but uh the uh the midnight black will be 70 and the cosmic red will be 75 i mean maybe

01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:01.860
red costs more or something i guess it's that red dye but it's it's damn it's gorgeous so don't lick

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:10.100
it yeah yeah but at any rate you know um if you want a little bit more flair to your non-existent

01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:16.020
ps5 there you go all right all right now we're going to take a look around the world at some

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.820
games you'll be able to play on those pretty new 70 controllers or 70 plus i should say

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:26.580
uh starting in the us loki yeah so we have a game called archaea which is coming out on nintendo

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:34.580

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:52.420
still making these games saying people buy them regarding allison do they though because doesn't

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:57.220
this i i could be completely wrong but doesn't this franchise keep changing hands because like

01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:02.420
is sold to the lowest bidder because like all these games are turd sure i don't know if it's

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.900
this one or like the last one but one of these was a kickstarter i think this may have been that

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:13.540
kickstarter game oh okay i got it all right all right let's go over to japan and check out some

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.540
releases over there uh it's it's getting busy i know golden week was a couple weeks ago we had a

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:21.700
kind of slow week after that but it's it's picking back up again so here we go on the switch this

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:28.100
week in japan rune factory 5 regular and limited edition angelique luminous luminarize uh in a

01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:33.540

01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:44.740
edition uh and then manifold garden also out on the switch uncharted waters 4 there's some type

01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:50.260
of power-up kit that comes with this uh there's a regular hd version and the 30th anniversary

01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:56.180
edition that comes with this as well i'm assuming the power-up kit must be an online thing um

01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:00.500
because it doesn't look like it's a like some of the peripheral in the box or anything like that

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:06.180
yeah it looks it looks a little bit like a nobunaga type of game but i could i could be

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:09.700
completely missing the mark there i'm seriously looking at just a couple screenshots here it's a

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.340
koi tecmo game though so uh and they are the ones with uh nobunaga's ambition so i wouldn't be

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:22.820
surprised if it's um related um let's see also on the switch this week we have um that's it let

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.620
me go to the playstation 5 and 4 and check out releases there mortal shell is out this week in

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:33.140

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:36.820

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:57.460

01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.620

01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:07.300

at screenshots to see if i recognize it i oh um is it kid nikki is it that kid kid nikki the

01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:23.060
mystical ninja i could be totally wrong on that somebody else might know it's kind of what i'm

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:32.660
drawn to at first though yeah um a kid nikki uh was i won this it was actually a different game

01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:40.500
it was called uh the wonderful yamcha uh yamcha maru oh okay my bad so it wasn't a going on game

yay a lot of people looking forward to that one yeah but i just like i kind of like wasn't

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:32.900
expecting that because i you know hadn't really been looking too much at the uh some of the

01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:40.660
upcoming switch releases um but what what decade did or what year did i pop back into

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.940
where we have leisure suit larry and me topia well if you go back to the way way back uh the

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:51.140
original leader suit larry i'm pretty sure was in early 90s maybe even late 80s type of thing

01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:59.700
uh and um yeah uh uh the other is a little more recent yeah yeah oh this game's bobby

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:04.980
blackpool's reminding i enjoyed me toby on 3ds dark soccer was the big baddie in my game because

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:09.540
you could you could make your friends the um monsters and i seem to remember a conversation

01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:17.380
at e3 or something about this and you ended up being the daddy yeah that's great all right uh

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:23.380
let's move on then we have some more news this first story is is interesting to me but loki

01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:31.540
i'll let you talk about it here yeah so sega i guess uh part of their latest financial results

01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:38.340
report they had sort of i guess realized that hey they've got a bunch of these really recognizable

01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:45.780
ip's that they've been sitting on forever that um perhaps they could remaster remake or reboot them

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:52.420
um they were listing off um you know some examples like crazy taxi jet set radio

01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:59.620
uh space channel five rez panther dragon knights shinobi virtue fighter altered beast house of the

01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:06.820
dead serisa rage soul hackers etc um basically saying that you know after careful examination

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:14.260
you know we can remade re-release these perhaps people would want to buy our popular games

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:19.220
well they have re-released a lot of those um yeah i understand that but like yeah alan get

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:24.180
to give alan a cheap plug he plays a lot of those games on his uh stream on the music mondays that

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:30.020
he does he i know he's played through space channel five part two uh and uh rez he's done before jet

01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:35.700
set radio so like you know they have re-released those two games on steam but how do you not

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:42.340
realize like hey maybe this is a good idea like it seems very obvious to me i don't know oh

01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:47.540
i'm sure go on twitter and i'm sure there are plenty of people that are saying who do i have to

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:52.100
bang in the parking lot to get a new jet set radio there's a lot of people that would love love love

01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:57.620
to see that so um i hope so i'd love to see a new space channel five to be fair we did get the vr

01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:02.660
thing um but i just haven't gotten around to playing the vr thing yet but i know i know there

01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:06.500
is that so at least we know it's not forgotten forgotten but yeah i think i think a lot of us

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:11.140
would like to see uh you know some of these old sega classics make a resurgence uh pod culture

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:17.220
and chat uh quite loudly says just do a damn dreamcast mini ffs we all know what that means

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.980
so yeah i think there's a lot of people that would be very excited about that but it has to have the

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:27.860
little the little um thing the tamagotchi thing you take with the vmu thank you uh that you take

01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:35.220
with you so all right uh dart to see you in chat says i know people beg hadeke nagah numa uh for

01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:39.460
a new one but he just redirects them to sega i mean what's he gonna do about a new jet set radio

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:48.900
that's right yeah yeah go to sega all right more spiritual successors yeah um going on to the next

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.980
story which i think this is really cool and i talked earlier about like you know hey more

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:58.980
accessibility type of things is awesome and i i love this uh microsoft is talking about something

01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:06.500
they are working on with speech transcription and text-to-speech synthesis for party chat

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:11.140
so xbox insiders actually have access to this which i i think i'm one of those so i need to

01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:15.940
go look and see if i have access to this even though i i hardly ever talk with people on xbox

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.900
i don't know what i'd use it on um but maybe it would work on pc uh presumably i don't know but

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:26.260
anyway i think this is great uh so this feature is going to make it easier for people who maybe

01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:31.140
you know have hearing or speech difficulties they can actually read what's coming up in party chat

01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:37.060
because it's being live transcribed on the screen uh these features are in the ease of access tab

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:42.580
under game and chat transcription uh with this on words spoken in a party are converted to text

01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:47.700
displayed in an adjustable overlay uh and if you have text-to-speech enabled anything you type in

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:53.300
party text chat will be read by a synthetic voice to the rest of the party so it's a way for you to

01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:59.460
have a speaking voice as well if you want um so that's really cool and uh a feature i'd like to

01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:05.460
play around with i love that i would love to have transcriptions of this podcast available

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:11.620
unfortunately the reality is all the services that offer it um are way too expensive like you know

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.020
and i get you know people don't do work for free so it has to and all these services i'm looking

01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:22.180
at are actual people working so i get it but the problem is um a three hour or you know at worse

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:27.060
maybe two and a half two hour whenever on some weeks this podcast like it's really expensive so

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:31.380
i just i can't afford it but if there were some type of like automated way to do it which somebody

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:37.140
was telling me to use youtube to do the transcriptions and um i it's not youtube isn't

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:43.940
great at it but it might be a start um so yeah i i would love to have that um just even for this

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:49.860
show check on some options yeah that'd be cool just if it costs money the answer's no all right

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:58.260
the answer might be maybe all right um depends on who's fronting it yeah so um all right let's move

01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:04.660
on uh i think this one's two years dark talker yeah i was just about to start it now this is

01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:14.100
already passed so this was actually for friday uh may 14th um itch.io uh held its first ever creator

01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:22.420
day which i don't know how that went um but they were they went to forego its usual cut of sales

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:28.820
um so a hundred percent of any transactions that day after taxes and payment processing fees

01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:38.340
were going directly back to the creators so basically it was a good way to to put these

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:42.740
indie developers give them a little bit more money in their pocket i mean and the thing with

01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:50.500
um with itch.io already is that they have a default 10 cut of sales but it could go

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:57.140
between zero and 100 depending on what the developer wanted to do um and so they take a

01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:04.180
much smaller cut than the 30 industry standard um so i thought it was really cool that you know

02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:11.220
they gave back yeah i was gonna say i'd known about it i know i wish i'd known we would have

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:16.340
hyped your game more to get uh sold then but uh s is showing her matt does remind us in chat

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:22.020
speaking of itch.io loki's game is on it and drops the link there to uh buy pixel poops number two

02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:27.620
i appreciate that and i sold uh just reordered my labels because they got screwed up the first time

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:33.220
so still working on that physical edition all right nice all right well maybe we'll do another

02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:38.980
one of those uh creators day again uh in the future that would sure be nice all right meanwhile loki

02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:45.780
all right so um you know this is kind of funny because it's almost like a meme here but

02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:51.780
uh we we remember the ever given container ship on the suis canal well apparently uh

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:58.420
nintendo's switch shipments were impacted by that now i might say though that's a likely story

02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:03.860
nintendo that your your shipments were this is the reason why there's a shortage on your consoles

02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:12.980
right it's because of this um i'm skeptical if you may say um but apparently they said yes that

02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:19.460
that caused delays for the product in europe and some of the uh inventories are a little bit tighter

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:28.580
in those countries sure sure nintendo we'll believe you this time but i'm skeptical i'm on to you

02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:35.540
you think it's just a convenient excuse i'm sure that they'll say that the ever given like the

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:39.780
digital version of the ever given is just like it's just jammed into the e-shop that's why we

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:44.340
got to take down mario you know in march because it's just that mario games just can't get through

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:51.620
there so i don't know i don't i'll believe them this time uh bobby blackwolf in chat says remember

02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.020
that ship didn't just block its own stuff it blocked all ships yes it wasn't just about the

02:01:56.020 --> 02:02:01.620
one ship that was stuck but obviously it caused a traffic jam uh but like the worst possible kind

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:08.820
that went on for weeks really um no so yeah it's just like nintendo always has hardware shortages

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:14.100
on everything so this doesn't help but i think what i think when it happened we all sat here

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:20.660
going it's not going to help you know so right yeah there is that all right um let's move on

02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:26.660
and uh get to our last story tonight which is rumor-based but these are rumors that are

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:34.820
gaining a lot of steam so you know take for it what it is they're rumors um but anyway uh so

02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:39.780
there's uh this blogger out there zippo that i guess has got some things right before and

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:44.740
it's kind of talking about what nintendo is doing for the rest of the year um and i guess based on

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:48.740
his track record some people are kind of you know running with it a little bit so what is it that

02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:51.700
he's talking about for the rest of the year and this isn't the first time i've heard of this

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.420
apparently a 2d metroid is something that's being worked on and that apparently it's it's done and

02:02:56.420 --> 02:03:01.300
it's ready to go um so that would be something if we got that really soon you know i love mesa

02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:07.460
metroid apparently runs at 60 frames a second but you know as i would encourage everyone else to do

02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:11.860
don't set the bar high with this stuff i'm not gonna okay i'd love this but i'm not going to

02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:18.500
assume it's happening metroid prime 4 is happening nintendo's confirmed that someday apparently a

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:24.340
donkey kong game from the folks behind mario odyssey is being made it is uh like a 2.5 d type

02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:29.620
of game sounds a lot like like the tropical freeze type of thing uh it could be very interesting so

02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:35.460
that is something that's being worked on as well as a new fire emblem super mario party 2 more 99

02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:42.900
games uh and um apparently and what i think is interesting about this rumor and one reason why

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:48.420
i'm willing to kind of believe it a little more than others is that they go as far to say zelda

02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:54.100
2 not this year so i think that's interesting that they're actually kind of placing the bet

02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:59.460
there that that isn't happening this year uh and the reason why uh issues uh raised from the

02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:05.300
pandemic it's almost complete but the end of the year doesn't seem feasible but it seems plausible

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:09.780
if we want to go back to that word uh that nintendo could announce uh that it would be like

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:15.620
a spring type of game so maybe the same release time frame as say animal crossing since clearly

02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:20.260
they can put out a new zelda whenever they want they don't have to do it for the holidays uh they

02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:24.980
could do it whenever they want and it'll still sell like crazy and then of course a big one the

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:29.300
new mario kart game there is a new mario kart game that's being worked on as well however it

02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:36.180
may not be mario kart 9 um and the the blogger here doesn't know if it's maybe a mario kart 9

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:41.620
or if it's nintendo kart or maybe an expansion for 8 or something so like isn't willing to kind

02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:46.740
of place stock in any of those but that there is a new mario kart in development and that that

02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:51.540
is coming at some point so you know this is what people are talking about on twitter and things

02:04:51.540 --> 02:05:00.180
like that uh certainly a list like that it's it seems believable enough but again i'm not

02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:06.820
going to place bets on anything who who called the game builder garage thing nobody so that came out

02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:12.020
of left field so i think there's also a lot of there could be unexpected stuff as well and there

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:17.460
are some things in there that are kind of safe bets again we've heard the 2d metroid thing before

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:22.340
uh to say breath of the wild 2 isn't going to make it because of covid um isn't that big a stretch i

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:28.740
know i said but it's not that big a stretch um a new mario party and a new mario kart of course

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:33.540
you know even though nintendo killed mario some of his franchises are still popular and so they

02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:41.300
will weekend at bernie's him through some more games uh to make the money so uh tiger class says

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:46.100
would that world circuit be considered mario kart 9 because there's jokes that's joe 100 matt saying

02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:51.700
mario kart 10 they're skipping the nine uh i i mean they could do anything they want you know the

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:56.740
the blogger said what about nintendo kart it doesn't even necessarily need to be a mario kart

02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:02.980
what if it's super smash kart i don't know like but i could see that maybe nintendo wants to go

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:08.020
beyond just mario i don't know we'll see we'll see um but i think it will be mario kart 9 or

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:15.940
it'll be i don't want to say a reboot but it'll be like a re like it'll be a mario kart's world

02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:21.140
or mario kart's universe or mario kart like they'll give it a new subtitle that kind of takes

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:27.860
it away from the other sequel games we'll see oh and uh the folks are talking about the home circuit

02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:31.940
yeah home circuit was like a spin-off it was a different thing that's a good call out because

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:36.580
that was a good example of something different that wasn't in the mainline games no that was not

02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:43.540
canonically mario kart 9 um but good call yeah that that was short-lived in my household too

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:52.500
yeah yeah i mean i i'm i'm no more physical things from nintendo anymore i'm not purchasing anything

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.620
that has a physical device because it's just not going to get used ever whether that be labo or

02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:03.540
the mario kart thing it's just it's not worth it boy we're making a lot of big statements tonight

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:10.580
all right let's get to our listener round table if you have some comments you'd like us to discuss

02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:16.260
in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network we can certainly get into those um and

02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:21.060
then of course we want to check our emails you guys email us every week over at participate

02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:26.100
at orange longtrady.com and dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and get some emails uh

02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:32.420
for us no i'm not oh are there none tonight nothing boo yes we have no bananas and i don't

02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:35.860
even think i have really anything on drag race there's literally nothing to discuss i'm not

02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:44.020
watching the drag race down under so now what happens oh okay i'm laughing i have no tea to

02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:48.820
spill so okay i will get to the discord comments but i have to get to this this is making me laugh

02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:56.660
as 100 mad is asking so rob how does it feel to go viral this week i finally after years and years

02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:02.180
on twitter had a tweet that ended up getting like a thousand plus likes on it so i'd say it went

02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:07.380
pretty viral even though when i told alan about it he was like well a viral tweet would be like

02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:16.740
20 000 likes and it was it wasn't even it's weird that's the interesting thing about what tweets

02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:22.980
hit is that i've had some tweets that are pretty fucking funny that don't go anywhere people don't

02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:28.100
retweet them i might get 40 or 50 likes from my followers but it doesn't get retweeted or anything

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.700
so it doesn't really go and that's fine that's okay but like the tweet i wrote that went viral

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:36.340
so what it was it was a play on this whole there was some dumb magazine or something that had a

02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:43.060
feature that was talking about geriatric millennials in the office place that apparently they're now

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:46.100
leading tea i don't even know what the article was about i didn't want to link it because i

02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:50.100
didn't want to give it the hits but everybody on twitter of course is dunking on this term

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:56.580
geriatric millennials i think loki would qualify as one with his age yeah but dark soccer and i

02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:01.620
what the fuck does that make us we're technically gen x at that point not even a millennial though

02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:09.380
because i'm 1980s so okay so you're like right at the end there so so i i just that would make you

02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:14.900
gen y i just i just made this sassy tweet and i found um a picture of a skeleton at a computer

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:21.460
and i put me i put me born in 1978 reading about geriatric millennials that tweet got fucking like

02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:27.220
a thousand likes on it and like a hundred retweets so it's it's weird is the answer to that matt i

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:31.620
mean i'm just laughing at it because like it's always the stupid tweets that go viral um the

02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:38.020
closest i ever got before was um like i think i think i got 300 or 400 likes on a tweet that was

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:44.260
using the hashtag um national send a nude day and it was just like a gif of judge judy and i just

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:49.860
put times almost up national send a new and i got like 400 likes it was a gif of judge judy banging

02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:56.580
the desk going hurry up like it was stupid like i wish one of my tweets about video games would get

02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:03.220
or a tweet promoting the show but we all the the reality is twitter doesn't do that all right anyway

02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:11.300
they haven't found our show by now i i know it's a lost cause at this point um all right so there

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:17.220
there's my answer to your question in chat as to another man all right uh going to discord um i've

02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.540
been uh starting to read discord comments you guys leave throughout the week over at vog network dot

quick it's like them embracing after saying i do but uh that was the thing so it's it's actually

02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:47.300
in the video that's really cool so that's sweet yeah it was i i and uh you know when they uh

02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:51.060
when that part came up it was like i know them i know them actually and actually that wasn't

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:56.420
the only person i had a twitter uh mutual that was in the video a little more featured talking about

02:11:56.420 --> 02:12:02.420
um like the gay representation in mass effect and what it meant to him so um there's a lot of

02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:08.660
a lot of like wow this is a small world i almost feel guilty for going off earlier but i don't

02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:12.740
i mean like you can love a game and still be pissed off that it's not given the love and

02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:21.700
affection it deserves we it's that's what it is we protect we we protect our babies uh and that's

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:28.340
that's what it is when it comes to mass effect all right um let's see oh tiger claws link reminds me

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:33.300
of this did you guys see loki you had to have seen this all the hubba balloon around the calculator

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:39.620
game on nintendo switch have you seen this i saw that they had like a calculator app yeah and it

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:45.060
looks exactly like the iphone calculator like right on down to the colors but it's like a

02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:50.500
scientific calculator going for 10 bucks but internet gonna internet this is like the whole

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:55.860
like rage like oh man this calculator is the best thing ever it does everything it says it's gonna

02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:03.140
do it's so powerful and it's like i don't know why this is becoming a meme but internet what can you

02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:08.340
say they have like like there's like art programs and stuff on there as well like nobody's making a

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:14.180
big deal about that i guess it's just silly that calculator's on there yeah whatever you know um

02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:19.860
act deft asking the real questions can that calculator run doom um i don't think so because

02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:26.020
it doesn't have that kind of screen on it but but never say never act deft um w04 in chat asks

02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:31.620
what are the chances of a new maximum carnage video game now that the new venom movie is coming out

02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:38.180
um i mean as good as anything else uh but usually like i feel like they haven't like the marvel

02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:43.620
and even dc stuff they haven't really been doing a lot of like this is something the industry used

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:48.180
to do that they don't do as much anymore they haven't done a lot of stuff directly from like

02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:54.740
current movies it's like the avengers exists in its own universe in the games now and it's not

02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:00.260
just a port of the movies right some spider-man skins maybe and that's about it yeah that's

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:08.980
probably it but again never say never all right um let's see never ever never ever sj100 matt and

02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:13.380
discord with a big headline we didn't get to tonight uh bobby talked about it a little more

02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:21.140
on his show but it's the whole hubble about starfield from bethesda is going to be exclusive

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:27.220
to xbox and pc uh originally uh it was thought that this game was going to be exclusive to sony

02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:32.660
but is anyone surprised that microsoft bought bethesda and now this game is going to be

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:37.460
exclusive it'll probably be just like a timed exclusive maybe well i don't know if it's gonna

02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:43.940
be a complete exclusive i want some of that money it is suggesting that it is a complete exclusive

02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:51.700
and it's going to show up at this e3 and it will release in 2022 nice so uh we'll see hope it

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:58.100
doesn't suck i'm more interested in the uh new uh sky or new skyrim new elder scrolls game whenever

02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:04.180
that comes out yeah all right um i think uh let me see if i can get through a couple more of these

02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:07.620
but first let me go to uh loki and get some last minute stories and then i'll do a couple more

02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:13.780
discard discord yeah i don't got any of those what all right um looked there wasn't really anything

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:19.780
worth covering i'm sorry i want to say marcus in our discord uh shared that article about the ps2

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:24.420
exploit that talks about uh certain versions of the system being region free you have to scroll

02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.260
up a bit because he posted it on may 10th but i know that came up on a previous episode of the

02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:36.420
show um so there is that um going back okay well here i got something um so ebay is banning the

02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:43.700
sale of adult video games so they're going to be implementing a new adult items policy on june 15th

02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:51.460
and they're going to be you know blocking anything that's basically unrated you know triple x x um

02:15:51.460 --> 02:16:00.260
also explicit uh comics books films animation manga hentai yaoi um i don't know if it that

02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:06.900
necessarily applies to video games though but maybe if it's unrated so sorry no bmx triple x

02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:11.300
uh used or i guess you're not gonna find that anymore you have to go to the facebook marketplace

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.540
for that we have to steal it online like a lot of people do these days not that you should do that

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:19.940
now you should do that but sometimes when it comes to games preservation we're left with minimal

02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:25.060
choices all right i want to mention this in chat so bobby blackwolf in chat is talking about this

02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:30.660
and dark soccer this is up your alley um literally in a way uh was this was there something earlier

02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:35.860
about mandalorian pinball no i didn't bring it up because you did bobby so we we don't always

02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.580
have to talk about the same things but uh dark soccer of course is a pinball geek so i think

02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:45.140
the world wants to know her reactions you're not getting it bobby is so you can fly to atlanta and

02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:50.980
play to his house there's already a bunch of people who are like selling their pre-orders

02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:55.700
on ebay that well it's probably because there's the whole like three editions right you talked

02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:59.140
about a black knight table recently that had this whole thing there's like a limited edition

02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:05.140
a extra edition the same thing's going on with the mandalorian yeah well the thing the the big thing

02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:12.900
is is that we just got a new to us uh pinball anyway we have uh the jersey jack guns and roses

02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:18.980
oh cool yeah it's really cool i actually i actually kind of like it i want to come over

02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:24.980
and play pinball come over yay all right let's play come over tomorrow uh maybe

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:31.140
don't you stream on mondays no alan's yes oh i actually stream on mondays earlier

02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:39.380
oh well yeah after the show and all that but yeah yeah all right after what show the the one we're

02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:44.180
on tomorrow oh tomorrow well i thought i thought i'd do tonight i do monday and i do tuesday

02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:50.500
okay all right i'm so confused all right uh at some point it doesn't have to be tomorrow

02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:57.060
just whenever uh come over and play pinball um and then in in uh september hopefully uh enough

02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:03.300
people get vaccinated where dragon con can be a thing and uh even if it's a little even if it's

02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:07.060
a downscaled show this year which i'm expecting that might be the case they'll probably still

02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:11.300
have dragon con but they're probably going to do some things to try to not have people gather

02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:16.260
quite in mass as they do but i don't know i at the same time my perception's fucked because i'm

02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:19.860
in california not georgia and my understanding is things are very different out there so

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:26.260
it might just be the same old dragon con we'll see but i i know the folks behind it will not have it

02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.340
if they don't think it's going to be safe i have that trust because i know there's people many

02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:35.940
people in atlanta who work at the cdc so uh and uh many folks on dragon con because of that but

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:40.580
anyway assuming i get out there um in september i will look forward to playing bobby's table he'll

02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:47.620
have it by then right i think so i think so um which by the way they changed my flight out to

02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:52.820
dragon con i had to call delta to try to get an earlier flight i was on hold for 40 minutes and

02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:56.100
still didn't get through so i have to try calling again tomorrow because the online wouldn't do it

02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:01.220
for me trying to get on an earlier flight because um it has me getting there at like eight getting

02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:06.500
to the airport at like eight o'clock on wednesday eight pm and that's um pretty late in the day so i

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:11.060
want to catch a early morning flight and get there a little sooner if i can because we have a

02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:16.100
tradition we always go to that 24 diner around the corner on wednesday night and that was the very

02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:20.500
first place i took alan when we went to atlanta was that little diner where he drank way too much

02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:26.500
sweet tea and uh we always go there on wednesday nights before the craziness kicks in and if i get

02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:33.940
there that late i mean i guess they're 24 hour but still still still still all right um okay

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:38.180
i think i think that's about it uh i think uh we're gonna wrap up that's about the end of the

02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:44.260
show uh before we do let's get some final thoughts um let me say of course as i always do here at the

02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:34.660
at the beginning of the show gaming is so much more than pixels on a screen i just appreciate

02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:39.380
you guys that spend your sunday nights with us or whatever a two-hour three-hour period throughout

02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:43.620
the week you dedicate to listening to olr even if we're your background noise while you do your

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:49.060
day job hey i'm glad we could be there with you and i hope i hope the customers didn't suck today

02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:54.900
all right um let's uh let's get some final thoughts um loki i'll start with you your final

02:20:54.900 --> 02:21:00.260
thought uh my final thought is i'm hoping to have episode well i promised episode two will be out

02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:04.660
this week for my youtube series i'm starting it's not really a series yet because there's only one

02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:09.940
video but it will be a series eventually um so that'll be out this week episode three will be

02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:15.460
much sooner than that because i'm pretty much already filming everything for that so i'll just

02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:22.180
turn around that much faster but um yeah look for that all right and dark sakura i'll let you have

02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:29.540
your final thought um stay tuned i'm gonna play dead by daylight and try to get a gnome all right

02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:35.140
good luck with that yep all right and my final thought um i don't really have a good one there's

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:40.260
there's a lot of exciting and scary stuff going on in my personal life um just send your good vibes

02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:44.500
my way um there's a lot a lot going on i will talk about it on the show but it's going to be

02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:51.380
a little bit so um yeah um nothing of concern nothing of concern um okay that's it and gaming

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:54.580
is for everyone i think it's a good note to end things on yes it is as well since we always talk

02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:58.500
about gaming is more than pixels on a screen i think it's a good reminder gaming is for everyone

02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:02.900
