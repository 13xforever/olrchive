1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,620
The console arm trace continues to be interesting, since graphics quality can no longer grow

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,520
as dramatically as it did generation over generation. Xbox rode the wave of Kinect across

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,420
two generations, but as of the series generation they have no extra piece of gaming tech, while

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,520
rumors say that Sony's PSVR2 or PS5VR will be impressive, challenging even today's

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,800
VR headsets. The story of consoles never ends, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,240
Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about it and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,440
right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,880
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:01:01,960
with episode number 869 of our show for this May the 18th, no 16th of 2021 I can't read

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,980
my own numbers. Hi I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co-hosts say hello as always

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,380
to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi how are you? I've had a long day but a fairly

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:24,180
good day. Yeah. I went to one of my favorite places to eat and loaded up on, finally they're

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,900
back to having the pink garlic sauce at Pita Kitchen. Nice. Just saying. Oh I don't think

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,940
that was there. Sumac is delicious. Yeah, yeah one of our favorite local little restaurants.

16
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,940
We are based in Sacramento, California so sometimes it's, and all three of us live in

17
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,300
the area, we live in the suburbs if nothing else, and so sometimes we can't avoid the

18
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,380
local chat such as favorite restaurants, but if you happen to be local and you know

19
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,700
this place Pita Kitchen, I was just telling Jamie before the show, Alan and I were there

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,340
like a week and a half ago and it was it was marvelous and it's a small little restaurant

21
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,060
you know it's like a small team that runs it so I'm really glad they're still around

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,860
that's for sure. Absolutely but you know we they had some different stuff there in their

23
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,740
little grocery store and I picked up some spinach and cheese pies they're wrapped in

24
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,060
filo dough they're absolutely they're like giant spanakopita it's really delicious. Get

25
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,620
the baklava because I've had bad baklava but theirs is really good. Theirs is always delightful

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,740
and we actually got into a discussion on like how terrible making filo dough is and she's

27
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:38,980
like we don't make it. Awesome. But yeah we had a really good time but I'm really irritated

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,780
that the the pet store that I go to does not have Midniss food nor had they had it for

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,260
the last three weeks and I get her refrigerated food so they don't like keep any extra stock

30
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:58,060
and pack so I had to buy her raw food. I was gonna tell you we can't even like the food

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,340
that Smoosh eats we can't even get it at like the big brand we have to go to the indie pet

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,340
store over by Lomond's that's the only place that will have the food and that's not the

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,180
closest pet store to us but it's whatever it's the only place that has the food that

34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,100
Smoosh will eat so you should check that but maybe they have the food. What are you feeding

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,460
him like caviar from a live sturgeon? No it's just a certain brand he's he's a weird kitty

36
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,900
you all know that he doesn't he doesn't really care for kitty treats either it's it's interesting

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,860
so anyway we will get to get look local discussion is inevitable sometimes if you if you are

38
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,460
unaware with the history of our show you know we we are the longest running video game podcast

39
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,460
because we started well video game show because we started this in online show we started

40
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,900
this in 2002 so podcasting wasn't even really a thing yet but we we did get in on podcasting

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,380
really early it was before it was on iTunes when you had to use things like lemon pod

42
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,940
I think it was called to a sink your podcast was like 2005 we won the very first podcast

43
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,540
award in gaming we were fortunate for that but anyway we've and I have the award yes

44
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,860
you do there it is uh yeah 2005 uh dark soccer Loki and myself um hi tech master Loki by

45
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,060
the way I hate to make you sit there in silence my bad but we all met playing dance dance

46
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,800
revolution at Roseville golf lands so we there is a local sense of connection here

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,420
on the show and you know in those early years if you didn't already know the story at OLR

48
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,780
we talked a lot about DDR that was our scene and that was our community and then Konami

49
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,220
kind of abandoned DDR for a few years and then wanted a seat at the table again once

50
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,020
guitar hero and rock band got big and it was awkward but our show grew into all sorts of

51
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,500
video games because we just love video games dang it right they're like looking at at rock

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,300
band going um but what we had this oh you've got better button that's right Konami you

53
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,620
had the opportunity and you didn't take the risk so someone beat you to it you blew it

54
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,660
bitch that's I that's you know they even they even screwed up their own rendition of that

55
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,260
as well considering that they had a winning formula and they're just like now let's put

56
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,860
out rock revolution instead Loki I think your audio is coming through your webcam not your

57
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,580
mic just you know it's it's kind of tin canny okay yeah you might want to check that anyway

58
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,740
but while he fixed that live I'm gonna check our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

59
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,820
because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

60
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:32,260
right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the voice of geeks Network twitch.tv slash vog network I

61
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,700
almost said twitch.tv slash Bobby Black Wolf area for two yes much better for two reasons one I

62
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,940
forgot to say happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf on our throw call tonight that was on my mind his

63
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,980
birthday was this past week so happy belated birthday again I know he's 20 wriggling day go

64
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,860
go figure so for the first time obviously happy happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf and congratulations

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,620
to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who announced this week he will be an announcer during summer games

66
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,660
done quick for the it's his third time at a games done quick event pretty much all the virtual ones

67
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,660
at this point so congrats we don't know what games he's announcing yet we're expecting to find that

68
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,700
out tomorrow but as I understand there are no Yakuza runs this year so there's not gonna be

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,940
like a baby thing or any of that stuff that yeah I know too bad huh but it's well it's also at the

70
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,140
same time we can say ah but I do love the games done quick like mixes up the games right because

71
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,380
how are other games supposed to get a shot if you know it's always the same games so I think that's

72
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,020
great um let's see some of the comments speaking of the local chat and then I promise we'll get

73
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,820
into gaming news pod culture says how long has it been since Pinkberry was mentioned well that that

74
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,900
is a bit of a local place but I think that I think it's a like a West Coast no it is it's

75
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,860
international I've seen it in it hurts I've seen it in airports pinkberry in Atlanta I think it

76
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,340
started at the airport I yeah I think it started in LA so there's like a lot of them in the West

77
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,420
Coast but anyway long story short the one that are soccer and I used to go to closed and Alan

78
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,140
also my husband kind of let it known that he has a preference for another place called Menchie's

79
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,300
and so that's one of those yogurt battles I just give in on like my husband's allowed a nice thing

80
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,500
once in a while and well they also good they also have dole whip it or Menchie's yes yes what

81
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,460
yeah what yeah they do they do like a dole whip type thing so this has to happen I don't know if

82
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,300
it's official though it but it's their own version of it they I don't think they can call it that but

83
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,060
it's basically that yeah the you know what I still think we need to do is that we need to have a

84
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,460
dinner at Brookfield and then go to pinkberry well you know especially now that I don't want

85
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,940
to say the pandemic is over because it certainly isn't but now that we're getting vaccinated and

86
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,900
you know it make light right now well you know I you still want to be cautious and I know there's

87
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,380
the CDC guidance and a lot of people are a little skittish about that because unfortunately this

88
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,140
panda I mean whereas the science says vaccinated people aren't gonna spread it you can hang out

89
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,260
with other vaccinated people without a mask the reality is a lot of us are a little bit unfortunately

90
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,500
this whole instance has seen the best in people and the worst in people and I don't trust people

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,020
to be honest exactly and I don't think a lot of us do we don't trust other people to be honest and

92
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,580
that's really unfortunate but hopefully more and more people get vaccinated and that'll that'll do

93
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,300
the trick because the vaccinations are working that's it period so the more people to get

94
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,140
vaccinated the less longer this is gone but anyway it's nice to think that some of those

95
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,260
things are a possibility again like the you know Brookfield's trip and you know who may be going

96
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,260
to see what a sad place Rosewood Golf Land is these days and what have you all those types of

97
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:59,500
things so yeah who knows a lot of exciting stuff coming in the next few months I'm sure I think

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,580
it would be fun to film a trip like that and put it as like a bonus video at vog network for our

99
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,020
subscribers that might be fun so you know what though I legit haven't been to Pinkberry since

100
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,660
2019 I haven't been in about a year myself I still like it like just because I give in and

101
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,660
my husband gets to pick most of the time I still I still I still sneak and have it I'll be at an

102
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,860
airport and I'll be like oh I'm gonna have that so didn't need blood orange back and then I'll go

103
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,860
huh speaking of air pop go ahead I was gonna say I stopped going there because I just didn't like

104
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,700
their flavors like I had one like they started doing these like kind of they were sort of ice

105
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,380
cream but not ice cream and they just started like really weird flavors I didn't like so that's what

106
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,660
pissed Alan off to their their flavor selection was so limited and once they would get a flavor

107
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,620
that he really liked it would be gone at the end of the month they rotate something else yeah do

108
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,500
do you know though what I what I miss hmm is I miss Naya the gelato place that was all in the

109
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,740
area oh I don't I don't think I ever ate there maybe once so so alright and I'll get off of it

110
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,660
after this but just imagine you have a place that has something like 20 different flavors of gelato

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,100
and they rotate a lot of their flavors and they had champagne they had Guinness they had whole

112
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,260
wheat that tasted like eating cereal they had like all kinds of just different ones and the

113
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:29,900
alcoholic ones were actually alcoholic and I ate a big ol bowl of Guinness and champagne it was

114
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:37,020
delightful no I miss is we had a place over here and I think it's a chain Rita's that's frozen

115
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,820
custard yes the one that's nearby all right all right look super disappointed that's so so good

116
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,500
look can you tell me when ice cream I get that snacking is important and if if the chat wasn't

117
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,940
lighting up going mmm gelato yes Rita's like if the chat wasn't supporting this we probably would

118
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,940
have cut it off a while ago but I do want to get into some gaming news because there was quite a

119
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,300
bit of it this week I'm gonna say okay I won't even talk then about the whole week kit kats oh

120
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,220
we could do a whole other spin-off show on Kit Kat flavors and we might but anyhow and my new

121
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,460
obsession is Pringles from around the world all right let's talk tonight our kickoff story tonight

122
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,900
we want to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest and you may be thinking like Rob are

123
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,420
you giving preference to one of your favorite games and letting it have the lead topic tonight

124
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,180
partially yes but even if you don't play Final Fantasy 14 please don't tune out completely I

125
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,260
assure you there's a very good reason I'm bringing this up at the top of the show talking about Fan

126
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Fest I'll get to there in a minute so obviously the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest convention is

127
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,460
virtual this year every other year they've done three of them in person they do a Vegas one they

128
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,340
do a Europe one they do a Japan one and it's usually like doing a tour of the latest expansion

129
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,140
announcement obviously because of COVID it was supposed to be in San Diego this year actually

130
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,580
they're gonna move it from Vegas but you know long story short we all know what COVID did to that so

131
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,100
they ended up doing these online events instead so they did that they did a original like keynote

132
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,580
announcement back in February Shane and I co-stream that with some of our buddies that we

133
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,980
play Final Fantasy with here at VOG Network and Shane and I did that last season not last night

134
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,900
Friday night as well is we actually were streaming the keynote event that showed everything else

135
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,180
about this expansion coming up and that was here at VOG Network so for those of you that subscribe

136
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,380
to us here at Twitch on here at VOG Network on Twitch first off thank you second off you can go

137
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:45,100
back and watch that if you want it is a longer keynote because the translation because they have

138
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,820
to say it in Japanese then they say it in English so you know an hour keynote now is two hours and

139
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,860
even within they were kind of having they were kind of stretching time like you could tell the

140
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,180
parts that you know the audience response would be yeah woo and like screaming and they that was

141
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,540
gone and so it would be these interesting moments of Naoki Yoshida the producer kind of leaning in

142
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,700
and looking at the TV monitors like literally reading chat as he's trying to do the whole

143
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,660
thing you know and and so for what for what it is with the state of the world being that it is

144
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,900
he did his best and I thought it was a he tried and it was it was a good keynote overall and a

145
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,420
lot of the expansion announcements about the game look great as we learned previously Final Fantasy

146
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,780
14 is going to be the latest expansion called Endwalker it seems to have a heavy Final Fantasy

147
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,620
4 influence because we're going to the moon and they are now selling a lunar whale mount in the

148
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:48,180
game as well as you can get Rosa Edgar and one other one I'm sorry not Edgar edge Rosa edge already

149
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,740
of course you can get I'm in the shop little minions are right now for in the game and there's

150
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,500
pre-order bonuses I think porum is the pre-order bonus and then Palom is in the collectors box I

151
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,900
might have gotten that backwards you know those those of you that really need to know that

152
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,340
information probably already know they gave us the release date though November 23rd that's a

153
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,660
little ways out I think some folks were a little bit like oh that's a bummer we're gonna have to

154
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,420
wait so long but I mean you know the the development of the game was really kind of stopped for four

155
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,620
months during kovat so if you think about it it does make sense so when he as awesome as this

156
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,220
expansion looks it you understand you want it to be done right of course right we hate it when God

157
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,420
they're trying to do it yeah we hate it when game companies release games and there's problems with

158
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:45,220
them hold that hold that thought it'll be relevant later anyhow oh and I'm gonna have an F you for

159
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,540
the record we'll get there meanwhile let's talk about some other information with obviously 14

160
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,260
and Walker they revealed the other class that will be playable in the game it's it's one of

161
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,260
the things that pains me the most in the world is having to admit when Shane was Shane is right but

162
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,820
damn that boy nailed it like he called that the new class would be the reaper class and it would

163
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,260
have a scythe and sure enough it was the reaper class with a scythe I think the thing he didn't

164
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,300
figure out might be enough to make me play again the thing he didn't figure out was that you get a

165
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,620
little ghost companion when you play it and you kind of like absorb the ghost hugs you it's the

166
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,180
most adorable thing I've ever seen and go look up the reaper trailer dark Sakura on the fantasy

167
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,540
14 channel it's pretty amazing the problem is is that I would have to buy the whole thing on Mac

168
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:37,580
again yeah that part's a bummer yeah cuz the yeah yeah so but anyway so you you kind of can merge

169
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,740
with the ghost and you do special attacks and that's cool they also unveiled and this was big

170
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,700
for me at the end I was not expecting it and if you go back and watch the feed I was literally

171
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,060
just in a state of shock because I my brain literally did not understand what was happening

172
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:59,340
when they announced male Viera are coming to the game as the next playable race by God male Viera

173
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:06,240
the bunny people from Final Fantasy 12 that have always been like Fran was the biggest most well

174
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,380
known Viera and the lore you only ever really saw female Viera I believe male Viera kind of known to

175
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,340
exist but they're not really seen but anyway long story short we're getting them in Final Fantasy 14

176
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,060
I've been a big advocate for this for a long time so I was thrilled and now that I've had time for

177
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,100
like my brain to process at all I am really thrilled with this and absolutely I'll be race

178
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,860
changing to a boy bunny as will lots of people that play Final Fantasy 14 I'm sure so that is

179
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,580
a very exciting announcement and then of course they detailed some new areas in the game and soon

180
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,860
some new things about the story they really detailed the collector's edition they wheeled

181
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,060
it out they have a pin and they have all this other really cool stuff that is coming out so

182
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:53,380
for the most part that was the keynote now the event continued on throughout the weekend and

183
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,900
they would do some panels talking about like they had one the live letter that kind of gave

184
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,380
a roadmap about what to expect between now and when the end Walker expansion releases like here's

185
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,100
the next story patch here's when we're gonna implement the data center moving which is another

186
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,180
huge thing about and Walker I'm so excited for that for example like Ziba here at vog network I

187
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,540
don't know she's listening live tonight but I know she listens to the show and she's always kind of

188
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,460
said a bummer you know she's on a different data center than I am we can't play together but in

189
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,340
Endwalker or shortly before Endwalker starts we will be able to do that with the data center move

190
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,060
so a temporary move I visit whatever they call it so that is gonna be very exciting and they also

191
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,420
do these big concerts this is the big big you know thing when you're there live the concert is

192
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,740
it man they did like a Friday night piano concert and they do a Saturday night concert with the

193
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:54,060
primals which is like a rock band that features Soken he's the guy that does all the music for

194
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,180
Final Fantasy 14 he actually like plays guitar and sings a lot of songs and all his band kind of

195
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,820
does that it's really cool unfortunately because the time difference they were doing this in Japan

196
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,740
it was on at like 3 in the morning for us here in the US so I didn't watch it live here's the part

197
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,260
okay perk up because here's the part that is a really big deal and had a lot of people in the

198
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,340
community talking today so they did the concert and after the concert is the closing ceremony but

199
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,860
it was a little bit different what happened is Soken wanted to talk to the crowd that was watching

200
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,340
for a little bit and he basically said you know thank you for your support thank you for everything

201
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,460
you've done this has really helped me get through the year and I'm very sorry I don't have the

202
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,100
official audio I tried to get that working before the show unfortunately it didn't work I tweeted

203
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,260
out that video earlier today if one of our resourceful folks like Tiger Claw or dark Tetsuya

204
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,780
could like pull that video from my tweet from this morning and like post it in chat and maybe the

205
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,780
discord I'd really appreciate it cuz and so that those of you listening on the podcast feed can go

206
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,860
check out on discord this video link um Soken was thanking everybody because he revealed that in

207
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:13,140
March of 2020 right before the coronavirus pandemic set in he was diagnosed with cancer and he didn't

208
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,700
reveal what type of cancer it was so we don't know those details but what we do know is that

209
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Square Enix and the Final Fantasy 14 team basically allowed him to work while he was in the hospital

210
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:34,300
and if you've played things like patch 5.3 there's a really big boss fight in that game with a really

211
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,540
epic song in it called to the edge I believe is the name of that song that song was basically

212
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,860
written while he was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and that song if you

213
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,940
listen to it has a huge impact like that like go back and listen to that song again now that you

214
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,500
know that information that is huge Soken's contribution I'm sorry I'm just this is a very

215
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,300
heavy topic we're getting into and I'm just like I actually got choked up watching the video today

216
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:15,020
and I get choked up thinking about it because you cannot understate the contributions of Soken to

217
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:22,100
Final Fantasy 14 I have said this on the show before there can be no successor to Nobuo Uematsu

218
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,860
what that man has done for Final Fantasy what that man has done for video game composition and

219
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:35,140
all of that can can never be replaced however what Soken has done with Final Fantasy 14 and

220
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,500
when you really consider that the project was a realm reborn and all of this the contributions

221
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:49,580
of Soken he's a worthy successor to Final Fantasy's music and I would assume I don't know I would have

222
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,300
assumed before I heard this news over the weekend that he was probably doing Final Fantasy 16's

223
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,020
music as well this situation I'm not sure if that's the case anymore who knows or any of that

224
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:09,220
um he didn't tell they did not tell the production team about his cancer because everybody was

225
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,300
working from home so people didn't know so this was the first time a lot of the production team

226
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,780
was finding out about this and so it was it was really heavy because you could hear the story

227
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,940
producer going like I I feel so guilty I was giving you so much work and asking all of these

228
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,780
changes for you when I was going through all this and Soken is basically saying and I am paraphrasing

229
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:37,660
here like I I am having this to work on having the fans feedback from things like the to the

230
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,500
edge composition having all of this kept me going and that's the part that really gets you choked

231
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:51,140
up and then something else to consider is that Naoki Ishida who's the producer of the game and

232
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,900
you know a big figure he's the face of the game he's you know the guy that gets out there and does

233
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,740
all these keynotes this entire time that Soken is talking he has his back to the audience and you

234
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:09,540
can tell he's he's he's breaking up he's tearing up and after about 13 minutes of discussion with

235
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,700
Soken and the team and everything he says I know this is a strange note to end the closing

236
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:24,700
ceremonies on but I just want to say that I am so happy that my best friend is still here and if you

237
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,900
don't get a little choked up in that moment watching it and again I'm sorry I can't be here

238
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,900
and play it for you guys but it might be triggering to some folks I don't know so if you go and watch

239
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:42,220
it if you don't get a little choked up hearing that I don't know you've had a different life

240
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,300
experience than I clearly because I had a hard time holding it together this morning watching

241
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:53,620
that you know when you consider what that this game what this community what this has done for

242
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,020
people and and Yoshida also explains this a little bit with that when he was giving his first speech

243
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:05,940
to the team when he was rebooting Final Fantasy 14 Soken was one of the first people to jump up

244
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,100
and advocate for him and say let's do this let's go and so you can tell there's a tight friendship

245
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:18,700
between these two and Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy the franchise is better for it so to hear

246
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,740
that all of this happened and none of us had any idea and the game sure it had a four-month delay

247
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,820
but are any of us gonna complain at this point no we are not because of everything we've heard

248
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:39,820
that this team is going through and what they're going through personally it's like wow now why is

249
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,740
this relevant to folks who maybe don't play Final Fantasy 14 I mean yes it's a nice story but I tell

250
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:52,220
you all this and I tell you about what you know Soken is literally pouring his heart and soul into

251
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:00,020
this game and using this as therapy to get you know to fight what is a horrific battle tell me

252
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:10,460
video games aren't art people I mean people that have said in the past video games aren't art or

253
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,060
people that mouth we had a story a couple weeks ago about somebody getting mouthy on their cable

254
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,780
talk show about oh twitch is just people watching plate people play video games not stupid I dare

255
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,860
that individual to watch that 13-minute video I watched earlier today fucking look them in the

256
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,580
face and say video games aren't art or the video game community isn't important or video games

257
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:45,020
don't fucking help people that fucking stereotype is done we've had it I don't know what else to say

258
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,460
that's that and that's why I wanted to bring it up is that like if if you can't listen to this

259
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,700
story and understand that video games are more than video games for a lot of people then you're

260
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:06,460
never gonna get it period so um Bobby Black Wolf in chat said Shane complained complained initially

261
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,020
but that was in the keynote I not to speak for him but a he's the one that texted me this morning

262
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,340
about all of that that went on and I bet if I asked him again he'd be like oh I get it and he

263
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,540
did kind of like during the keynote he was kind of like oh well you know yeah it's kind of the same

264
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,620
thing I landed I he's he's he's only bummed because it looks so good he wants to play it now but he

265
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,500
gets it I'm sure again I don't want to speak for him but I'm pretty sure he would say something to

266
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,220
the equivalent there fifth dream in chat says yeah Jesus that guy talking about soaking I have

267
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,180
literally hundreds a thousand songs by him on my PC I have all those Final Fantasy 14 blu-ray

268
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,340
soundtracks do yourself a favor folks even if you don't fucking care about MMOs and I get it like

269
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,700
it's monthly fees they're they're tough sometimes even though did you know Final Fantasy 14 is free

270
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,860
to play including the award-winning expansion heavens work this is like a meme at this point

271
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,900
but I'm serious you could check it out the first part for free but you go listen to the soundtracks

272
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,420
at least they're so good and there's so many like ways that they've remixed different songs in the

273
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:17,180
game and so forth it's it's pretty amazing let's see and sacred J points out it was it was

274
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:24,180
triggering I had tears yeah I mean it's it's it's very difficult to watch and yeah but I think it

275
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,940
just goes to show that like you know again video games are much bigger than pixels on a screen

276
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,500
that's for sure and especially when you look at a game like Final Fantasy 14 that has such a huge

277
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:43,060
community as it does it was it was a difficult but also a very beautiful thing to watch so it

278
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:49,380
just it just makes my heart for that game grow 10 more sizes honestly it really does but if you

279
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,940
if you don't play it and you're not into it that's okay too I'm sure you still agree with my bottom

280
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,900
line and recognize that there's a lot more to this game than a game that's for sure you know I still

281
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,300
listen to the old da theme when I want to chill yeah yeah there's some there's some there's some

282
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,900
great songs for lots of moods in that game at depth says there's some Final Fantasy 14 A Realm

283
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,940
Reborn tracks in theater them that are pretty good yes especially the arcade version has a lot of 14

284
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,980
tracks in them if you're ever lucky enough to play one of those that's for sure so all right so that's

285
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,580
why I wanted to talk about the beginning of the show video games more than just pixels all right

286
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:35,220
and kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team for being vulnerable for one and just a well-done fan fest

287
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,500
even if even if I was a little critical that it was moving a little bit slow I give them a break

288
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,420
because they were expecting it to be in front of a crowd and it wasn't it's gonna be awkward it's

289
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:53,460
okay I'm excited to play the expansion very very very much and listening to all of the music that

290
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,060
Soken makes for that expansion and he's they I believe they said chat please correct me if

291
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm wrong I believe he did say it is in remission um so um I I so uh yeah that's that does does

292
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,540
have a happy note there okay um moving on let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the

293
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,620
types of video games and and maybe some gaming things off the screen too that we've been into

294
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:23,700
this week uh Dark Soccer I'll start with you well I'm starting off with anger but I'll get to the

295
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,940
anger in a little bit so um of course I've been playing some Animal Crossing and uh my friend

296
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Mika who has been in chat before is also playing so I gave her about 30 to 40 DIYs of which six

297
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:45,220
remained since you just started playing um thank you for helping to clear out my recycle bin um

298
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,980
I also am doing and I don't know if a lot of people know about this but on the Nintendo online

299
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:59,060
app for your smartphone um if you go into that and then open up nook link you can redeem or you

300
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:07,540
can like earn points and they have six was six yeah six items that you can redeem at different

301
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:15,780
uh at different price points but uh there's like switch cases and a a door placard that looks like

302
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:22,340
the leaf but um three of the items are photographs and one of them is Isabel one is nook and the

303
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:35,780
other are the nooklings they they really boost your uh uh AHH or AHA whatever HHA score the

304
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,940
happy home academy yes happy home academy um and then of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight

305
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,620
because I haven't gotten the freaking gnome yet and I played a lot but I had a funny experience

306
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,660
and I do have to talk about this because it was hilarious so um I was in Hawkins which used to be

307
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,100
one of my least favorite maps and I guess the guys I was playing I guess realized I was you know

308
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:04,420
fairly new you know I was doing okay but I think that they were giving me looping practice because

309
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,580
they would wait for me and then point and then they would run the loop and I just follow along

310
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,380
and then they let me 4k nice how random is that though like that never happens usually people are

311
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,500
assholes it's it's interesting the way that people and this is in general for all games we're talking

312
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,940
about just dead by daylight in this instance but isn't it interesting how people can communicate

313
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,980
without communicating uh because I had a very similar sort of thing except I was the survivor

314
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,260
and for the record they were all console so I couldn't chat them oh bummer um I had a very

315
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,220
similar circumstance where I was the survivor and there was a nurse in the match and I was like

316
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,180
I was being chased by the nurse and the nurse wasn't using blink and I was kind of like this

317
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,860
isn't normal like what's going on I thought it must be a baby nurse oh my gosh so I would just

318
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,780
I did things like I just started booping the nurse like I would turn around and look at the nurse and

319
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,140
I booped the nurse into which response she'd hit me once but she would she didn't hit me twice

320
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:10,660
yeah so I so that was the communication to me oh she's here to farm so finally and without

321
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,460
communicating because again I was with randos we figured out this nurse wants to farm and so we

322
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,180
were doing healings we're letting the nurse hit us and all this stuff and then we left the match

323
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,780
pretty much helping each other out and left well uh dark soccer we were all on steam so we could

324
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:34,980
chat and the killer was like gg I have a daily to chase for 180 seconds as nurse yeah what the

325
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,420
fuck quest is that thanks for letting me get it and I was the one that ran him because I was like

326
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,260
why is this nurse chasing me and not using blink and I'm thinking in my head oh well I'm just gonna

327
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,980
keep running and like practicing doing that little did I know I helped him beat his quest and I had

328
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:56,900
that as a generic yeah so it's um so I had to do that on plague yeah yeah so it was just uh

329
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,900
interesting so communicating without communicating anyway sorry sorry to derail your daily week but

330
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,700
I really like that although there are times where if I do get somebody in chat I'm just gonna flat

331
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,300
out say you know if they're being little troll assholes I'll be like real mature and then I'll

332
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:17,620
just leave because don't care um usually I'm playing the plague so I can blood vomit on them

333
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,500
so that it forces them to leave the match anyway um so this is the thing I'm pissed about

334
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:32,820
so I did all of my reading up on the windows arm environment I am on a mac mini m1 I need it for

335
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,820
the majority of the work that I'm going to do I can game on it just fine except that you know

336
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:46,900
I installed parallels I got the windows arm beta up the developer's beta so I could have the

337
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:56,020
increased uh emulation and it won't run mass effect and I have paid for mass effect so I have

338
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:05,300
a uh a kvm switch arriving tomorrow and um I'm going to hook up uh my my pc again the old dinosaur

339
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:16,260
so that I can steam link on my mac okay yeah um and I think it's gonna be okay

340
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:25,700
it's just I then have to figure out another cord or cable to get I'm just I'm not happy about it

341
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:35,220
and I know that they are still working on the x86 emulation um for windows arm and I'm pretty

342
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,020
positive that you know it's not going to be too long away and I'm not the most super hurried about

343
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:49,860
it I guess because I have played them ad nauseum at the same time I need my space bird husband

344
00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:00,500
I need I need the voice of garris to just read the phone book to me yeah the struggle read the

345
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,620
presidium directory thank you garris well I hope you're able to um get that figured out or the you

346
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,540
know the emulation kind of pulls through I mean I get it's a newer game and it's really pushing the

347
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,460
boundaries of graphics and stuff so there's a part of me that kind of gets it but I also

348
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,380
understand how it's frustrating but it is isn't it nice that we have you know now that cloud and

349
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,180
streaming technology again jamie you've given more cases for why that stuff is a good thing

350
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,420
here on the show than any of us like you know you play dead by daylight on stadia you do you know

351
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,940
and uh it's it's interesting to hear how you're using this cloud technology to your benefit in

352
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,300
these different ways well and I'm really I'm really happy about it I mean right now the only

353
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:46,100
thing that I I would need uh my pc for is just for for mass effect and if I wanted to play dead

354
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:53,300
by daylight on on steam I'm going to log into dead by daylight on my pc just long enough to link my

355
00:34:53,300 --> 00:35:01,540
steam account to it yeah so that my purchases will transfer yeah smart um but I mean I I'm still

356
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,740
considering keeping parallels uh and keeping her to run the windows arm because I can now play hot

357
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,860
a full boyfriend again um but a lot of the other games that I'm playing are available on mac like

358
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:23,780
uh I still have to play uh uh the second edition of uh homestuck hive bent um you know which uh

359
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,060
I've just been putting that off and I'm probably gonna stream that too but other than that I'm

360
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:36,500
also playing fantasion which uh I'm moving into I've moved it to Tuesdays to do my weekly you know

361
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:46,420
chapter so my goal is to get through like a story segment every time I play nice and so I'm really

362
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,340
pleased with that and then I've also just discovered a lot of other streamers um and uh I'm really

363
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,700
really happy about that and uh pod culture asked me if g-force now would work for me um probably

364
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:05,860
because that's how um amethyst rose witch plays but it doesn't have mass effect don't so again

365
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,980
because it's because it's steam linked through origin yeah and so that's where the

366
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,820
ea probably wants to do their own thing eventually whenever they get around to it so

367
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,820
right right um I mean if ea puts out a streaming service then heck yeah I'll be able to you know

368
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,980
the the thing is that it's still probably need to play some sort of uh copy on my computer so

369
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,020
that I can mod the shit out of it later well maybe maybe as some xcloud and microsoft's technology

370
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,020
moves along that might actually be a good thing for ea because we know that ea play

371
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,740
and xbox game pass have an agreement together so that could that could mean something I it's

372
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,540
I'm hypothesizing but maybe when microsoft's cloud technology launches publicly that's going to be a

373
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:54,180
good thing well and you know what I've saved I have saved all of my character save files from

374
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,220
the earlier mass effects they work but not well not one they did change the save file format for

375
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,780
one but two and three will work that's what I heard yeah but what this means is that when I

376
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,620
start making a save file for one I can use the gibbed editor and change the way my shepherd looks

377
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,540
nice so well you know that's always kind of fun for me you're gonna the the thing you need in

378
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,780
mass effect legendary dish or you you've won it the photo mode that's all you need there's a photo

379
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,300
mode now you're gonna have a field day oh well you realize I was doing that anyway with fly cam oh

380
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,260
no I know I know that's why I'm like you're gonna have a field day because now it's built in

381
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,940
and everyone when I'm playing again look forward to the return of mass effecting

382
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:41,940
it will happen I might do it on tumblr I might do it on twitter it it it remains to be seen but

383
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,140
I've had people poking me already because I mean I got like over 10,000 followers on

384
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:53,060
tumblr for mass effecting nice so we'll see all right I didn't mean to go off about that and I

385
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,420
will never do tick tock just saying all right uh let's move on to loki loki we barely heard from

386
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:05,460
you tonight how was your gaming week it's been all minecraft surprise no um so I've been just

387
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:12,580
more progress on the server that I'm on um dill haven't put out the second episode yet but I've

388
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,740
got a lot of footage I have to go through my my problem is I'm stuck in this kind of bad habit

389
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,660
where I keep doing stuff in the game and keep recording it but not editing that all down so

390
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,900
I need to find a good stopping point and then right now kind of the stuff I'm doing has more

391
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:33,220
of an episode three type stuff but it's been lots of building farms and debugging stuff I've built

392
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,980
a piglin bartering farm but the problem with is the normal design where you can separate them by

393
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:46,820
one block because the server I'm on they have a dropped item entity reduction thing to help with

394
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,620
lag and so what happens is when you drop stuff too close together it kind of clumps together

395
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:59,940
and so that broke what I have with my farm so I had to um I have eight piglins right now to trade

396
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,860
with but I had to drop that down the four so every other one um in order to space them out enough and

397
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,620
I have to figure out I'm going to do the other four probably move them around or something

398
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,580
but that's what I've been working on it's a lot of work it's all of this like farm stuff just to

399
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,820
get the supplies I need to actually do more of the creative stuff um and then there's also the

400
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,700
way I plan for episode three is building like an actual shop in the shopping district so I've been

401
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:32,020
working on getting it all together I have a design done for it um just supply gathering right now so

402
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:37,620
that's what I'm doing with the the farms I have um and then outside of that a little bit of orna

403
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:44,740
um that's pretty much been it it's it's the same old stuff um sacred jade in chat is asking what

404
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,300
game is playing behind you tonight live on twitch you've got an interesting looking 16-bit game is

405
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:57,860
that is it is ghoul patrol that is the sequel to uh zombies ate my neighbors that I don't think

406
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,420
ever came out over here um but that's also something that we're I think it's one of the

407
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,740
stories we're talking relevant it is it's relevant to pay attention all right I have never played

408
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:13,940
this one but yeah it's uh I like the first one all right we'll talk more about that later meanwhile

409
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,940
my gaming week um so I've been continuing in dragon quest builders 2 um you I'm still in the

410
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,740
first area like my gosh there's there's a lot to this game I don't know if I'm gonna get through it

411
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,740
um I I really don't know if I'm gonna get through it with other stuff that's released now but I I've

412
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,860
been continuing on in that uh playing a little more final fantasy 14 uh thanks to fan fest and

413
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,780
there's a special moogle tome event going on in the game right now so I'm really motivated to

414
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,020
get back in there and do my roulettes and stuff again so um there's that and then I'm still

415
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,580
playing dead by daylight myself as well working on killer and survivor unfortunately I got to

416
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,140
this point where like I've gotten my killer up to you know like rank 12 or 11 which you'd think

417
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,260
would be a good thing but it actually is really annoying because I there's a lot of killers I'm

418
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,460
still working on I have no talents with and uh when I get matched up with players survive I get

419
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,580
survivor squads that just bully me and I can't do anything because I don't have the talents to

420
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,420
really go up against them the matchmaking in the game is really screwed up right now and I really

421
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,660
wish they'd work on that and then this whole thing with the rank reset went totally I didn't

422
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,900
even get rank reset so that and some people got like people at high ranks got reset all the way

423
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,460
down to like the lowest ranks and like that I don't know why that stuff was happening but yeah

424
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,740
behavior I really they need to work on that bugs aside I'm still at least having fun with the game

425
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:36,740
at least I don't give a shit about my rank I really don't and at least the blood points and

426
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,860
development of your character always goes forward never backwards so there's that so even if I lose

427
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,580
a game horrifically I still get some blood points and I can develop my character and that's what I

428
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:52,660
really want so there's that um and so those are all uh the the ones you'd expect me to talk about

429
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,740
that I've talked about a lot of weeks and then of course there's the big one so like dark soccer

430
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,500
talked about um I am a huge fan of mass effect and I've talked about that ad nauseum on this program

431
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,540
so it is no surprise whatsoever um that I picked up mass effect legendary edition as well this week

432
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:13,780
and I've picked it up uh yes and I I decided to pick it up on xbox one or xbox series x as the

433
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:21,140
case may be um uh that's where I first played the trilogy uh was on xbox 360 and I was like you

434
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,580
know I want to have a nice little plop on the couch and play through game I I want to I want

435
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,540
to play through the game this way and so that's what I did um I bought the physical version

436
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,780
because I heard that the digital version was like 120 gigabytes and I'm thinking in the back of my

437
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,420
mind I don't have the bandwidth for that right now like we we went over our bandwidth cap last week I

438
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,660
can't and Alan's gonna play this too and I'm pretty sure he did do the digital so we really

439
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,780
don't have the bandwidth for this right now so I'm like I'll get the physical and uh that'll work um

440
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,700
I gotta say I love the mass effect trilogy it's one of my favorite trilogies or honestly favorite

441
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,420
game series that's ever happened um having played the game a little bit I love what they've done to

442
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:10,100
the original mass effect it looks a lot better um the Mako stuff doesn't annoy the shit out of

443
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,260
you it's it's usable um there's a there's a lot of fun that being said if you haven't picked up

444
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:23,380
the mass effect legendary edition I don't know if you should get it right now uh and that might

445
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:31,700
surprise you but unfortunately there are some problems and unfortunately this is a fucking

446
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,580
trend with BioWare games lately and EA games lately and unfortunately I've hit my breaking

447
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:45,060
point with this shit and that is there's there's too many bugs I don't know if the game should have

448
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,300
been released I don't think it was necessarily 100% ready and I'm going to talk about the

449
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,100
biggest bug that's annoying the shit out of me it crashed my xbox which you know whatever of

450
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,900
course that's going to go right after an important part of the game it crashed thankfully it auto

451
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,460
saves a lot I didn't lose too much progress but that was annoying and dark soccer will talk about

452
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,700
some of the other reports coming in about bugs and things like that later on in the show but

453
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,740
I'm going to tell you the thing that's pissed me off more than anything and it might seem like a

454
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,540
little thing but I and I don't know if this is just me being 40 so I'm going full Karen in this

455
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,980
moment or whatever it is but I I fucking had it with this and this is the companies and the the

456
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:31,940
internet companies and the gaming companies not figuring shit out when it comes to bandwidth caps

457
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,500
and us losing as a result of that and I'm gonna this is exactly what it is so the xbox version

458
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,580
of the game comes with two discs one is labeled disc one that says uh play disc the other one's

459
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,780
labeled disc two which is installation disc I want to stress the xbox disc and the playstation

460
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:55,780
discs are not labeled the same okay so when you go to xbox here's what I did I put in disc one

461
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,500
of course because why wouldn't I I put in disc one to fire up the game okay I'm gonna install mass

462
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:08,100
effect one and uh then uh it installed mass effect one and it downloaded an 11 gig update

463
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,820
uh fine all right games need updates whatever 11 gigs worth I don't know okay I thought I thought

464
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,500
a patch actually just patched files like actually just substituted the parts 11 but I don't know

465
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,940
enough about programming I guess I shouldn't talk so 11 gigs then I'm like you know what while I'm

466
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,340
here since I've installed the first game why don't I just install the other two games because I'm

467
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,380
gonna play them eventually so I go to mass effect 2 I hit install and it props up on the screen and

468
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,140
says we're gonna download 36 gigs press ok to continue whoa whoa wait what what

469
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:48,100
you're gonna download 36 gigs for mass effect 2 what is this other what is this other disc

470
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,900
okay maybe it's mass effect 3 let's go to mass effect 3 I'm gonna download 38 gigs what what

471
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:01,300
what's this other disc sake okay let me um all right maybe I was maybe I need to oh I'll launch

472
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:07,780
the game from the second disc that'll that'll fix it so I put in the second sorry you need the

473
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:14,260
first disc to start this game okay all right so I put in the first disc maybe I need a disc swap I

474
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,820
eject the first disc I'm kicked out to the xbox menu long story short that second disc doesn't do

475
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:30,260
a goddamn thing what is it well from sleuthing around online what I have learned is if you keep

476
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:37,780
yourself offline when you initially install the game you will use that data disc as your second

477
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,820
and third install for mass effect 2 and 3 and then you can patch them but if that's stupid if

478
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,340
you're at the point where I'm at where you've already installed the first game and so I thought

479
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,780
oh okay I'll put myself in I shouldn't have to do this but I'll put myself in offline mode trick it

480
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,180
into thinking I don't have the internet then I can install from the disc and guess what nope the game

481
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:06,100
crashes because it can't figure out that it can't download the game because that initial patch I

482
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:14,420
downloaded apparently patched out the ability to install from the discs unacceptable and I'm sorry

483
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:22,900
if I've blown your ears out but I am so fucking mad this is so ridiculous that this is happening

484
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,620
like is it really that hard and I admit I don't know shit when it comes to programming games is

485
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:35,940
it really that hard to just have an option when you hit install that says download install from

486
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:42,500
disk it doesn't Loki you've made a game does that sound difficult what I'm asking for no and also I

487
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,300
don't understand why you wouldn't just install from the disc and not I get it downloading a

488
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,460
patch but like you would think that you would try to conserve I mean if you cared about your

489
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,140
customers you try to conserve their bandwidth as much as possible especially when we're talking

490
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,780
large downloads thank you this is and you know what I know there's going to be some people out

491
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,180
there that's like Rob is throwing a fit over something ridiculous and I warned you in the

492
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:11,620
beginning I admit this is like a little but it's I've hit my fucking breaking point I need the

493
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:18,100
gaming companies and the the cable companies to fucking figure out this bandwidth issue and I need

494
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:27,700
gaming companies specifically EA Electronic Arts and BioWare I need them to figure and honestly

495
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,620
let's say Activision as well because I know they're guilty of this shit with Call of Duty

496
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,020
and I don't even play it you guys need to figure out this fucking patching problem these day one

497
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,860
patches these 70 80 gig patches because we don't have the fucking bandwidth for it and I'm at the

498
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,420
point where I'm not going to buy games anymore if I hear that there is these gigantic fucking

499
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,140
patches on day one because apparently the game is just fucking broken to begin with

500
00:48:52,500 --> 00:49:00,420
like it's it's I I my mind is blown that there's a second disc and it doesn't do anything now at

501
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:06,100
this point and of course I've I've tried to do the Twitter thing where I've to nicely mind you

502
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,620
much nicer than I am now tweeting EA help Xbox support BioWare Mass Effect tweeting everybody

503
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,700
saying uh does this is this too not supposed to do anything am I doing something wrong what's

504
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,340
going on nothing of course not I'm just some jackass on Twitter they're not going to respond

505
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:26,980
to me who cares but I know I'm not the only one facing this issue and it's just and there's a lot

506
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,060
of people out there who don't care because they're like oh I've got unlimited bandwidth or oh I love

507
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,300
Mass Effect so much whatever I'm just going to take the 30 gig hit or whatever but like

508
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:42,980
as time goes on and as these you know things go on with COVID and and all this stuff like these

509
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:50,740
bandwidth issues are getting worse and worse so what am I what am and what so I dropped 60 bucks

510
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:58,340
on the game I I I opted to I could have actually gotten the game cheaper digitally because of the

511
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:03,620
Xbox game pass agreement and that whole thing with EA I could have actually gotten the game

512
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,980
cheaper I could have gotten it for like 52 dollars that way but I actually opted to pay the 60

513
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:14,020
dollars so that I wouldn't have to worry about the bandwidth thing and this is what happens

514
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:24,740
I also want to stress this is one example of things that are wrong with the game again the

515
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:30,340
game crashed on the as series x as I was playing through it later on Dark Soccer is going to bring

516
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,420
up some other stuff later that I know is affecting PCs and some people that are in some similar

517
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:44,100
issues what's like I've hit I'm sorry I'm just speechless because I in my mind I've hit this

518
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:50,500
point where suddenly some of these things we've laughed at and called frivolous lawsuits no longer

519
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:58,260
feel frivolous to me I want EA and Activision to be held accountable for this unnecessary shit that

520
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:05,220
hits my bandwidth I really do because I don't know what else is going to stop this trend

521
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:15,060
and I don't know it's not gonna they're not gonna do anything until it hits them financially

522
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:21,940
exactly exactly it's not gonna hit them financially so they're never gonna stop and it's

523
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,660
more like it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was like if the internet companies weren't the way

524
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:32,900
that they are and maybe and maybe that's what has and maybe that's what has to give in this

525
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,620
situation I don't know but it's still kind of weird though like you would think though that

526
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:41,300
it would prior illing because even like just not even necessarily bandwidth but like you're

527
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:47,060
unnecessarily like making people wait to download something and then install it when you have the

528
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,900
data on the disk that you just purchased why wouldn't you just use that I would think that

529
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:58,340
would even just be faster like I don't understand what the point is just just so I'm clear also

530
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,980
this does appear to be and somebody in chat if you know definitively can correct me from

531
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,460
this does appear to be an issue that is unique to Xbox because the PlayStation 5 discs

532
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:17,060
disc the one disc is labeled put me in first installation disc and then the other one is the

533
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:25,220
play disc oh yeah it's still fresh and honestly the way and that's just the way the PlayStation

534
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,860
5 is built with the whole backwards compatibility thing and the Xbox is built and for most

535
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,900
circumstances Xbox has kind of had the better backwards compatibility system but in this one

536
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,500
very specific case unfortunately it's it's it's fucked things up with the whole patch and

537
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:47,860
everything yeah E3VL is in chat saying second disc just launcher on Xbox second disc does

538
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:54,740
nothing but tell you to put in disc one believe me guys I've tried this every way you can think of

539
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:59,460
BioWare needs to put out a patch that allows you to install from the disc instead of automatically

540
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:06,980
going to the internet the disc I paid for that now does nothing to to do that and I I could

541
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:16,260
uninstall the 11 gigs I just did and start from scratch but that's I don't even know if that would

542
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:24,100
be a guarantee to work though number one and number two I shouldn't fucking have to and I've

543
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:31,940
had it so as much as I you know now that I've got and I've played Mass Effect and I've just you know

544
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:37,300
grinned and bared it through some of the crashes things like that and it's it's a great it's a

545
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:44,580
great remaster and you know what Mass Effect Andromeda had a lot of great shit in it and what

546
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:53,060
ruined it stupid shit that was rushed out too quick and that is why do I want to say it I'm

547
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,300
gonna say it this clip this is gonna haunt me so this is somebody's gonna clip this it's gonna

548
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,780
fucking haunt me I don't care this is why I am not buying the next Mass Effect game day one

549
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,420
I'm not gonna do it

550
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,940
this happened with the legendary edition this happened with Mass Effect Andromeda

551
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,660
this really happened with Anthem did this happen with Dragon Age Inquisition Dark Sakura I don't

552
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:24,900
remember not really Dragon Age Inquisition worked fine from day one okay yay so more more of that

553
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,820
when I started playing it I didn't notice a problem and less of your track records

554
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:37,860
you've recently developed under EA I've had it well and they also need to have arm support just

555
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:46,820
saying I I'm not gonna play the new Mass Effect because I know it's gonna get patched after a

556
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:53,540
month or two there's gonna be problems when it first releases and I'm putting my foot down this

557
00:54:53,620 --> 00:55:00,100
is one of my favorite franchises ever and I really want to support the team and I am so sorry to the

558
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,140
team and I'm so sorry to the people that this affects when they have nothing to do with it

559
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:16,660
but I've had it period going to chat quest buster says I can echo dark soccer on Inquisition it

560
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,100
installed and worked right from the start for me too okay great let's have more of that then

561
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,780
great but unfortunately I just named three in a row that are that are a little busted let's see

562
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:34,020
uh let's see RHM087 in chat says relatively small potatoes but I'm a little salty the switch card

563
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,820
for Starlink Battle for Atlas requires an update of around 10 gigs out of the box yes not a fair

564
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:47,860
comparison since switch cards can't hold as much data as a blu-ray okay that doesn't discount your

565
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:53,780
point and what you're saying though is that this is an industry-wide problem it really is

566
00:55:53,780 --> 00:56:01,540
like we have to do something about this day one 80 gig patch culture this is enough is enough

567
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:08,420
like okay a small a couple of gigs to patch things you know okay but this is too much this has to

568
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,060
stop and gamers gamers have to be willing to speak with their wallets and have to be willing

569
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:18,500
to forego some things their heart really wants to give him on and that's why I said what I said

570
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,700
about the next Mass Effect game when it releases in what 2024 2025 whenever it is and that's why

571
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,980
I'm like I'm probably gonna regret saying that because it's so far out but I've had it I've had

572
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:36,980
it so Bobby Blackwolf we were talking at the end of your show I said you might want to wait now

573
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,260
you know why because it's the same thing you might as well wait till they patch the crashing is the

574
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:48,260
trilogy will be great and the trilogy will still be there and I know the industry lives and dies

575
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,420
on you know how much a game sells in its first week but that is something that's going to need

576
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,740
to change too because I'm sick and fucking tired of buying games in the first week to have this

577
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:06,900
shit happen and going back to the comment on what RHM said Nintendo is about the only company

578
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:15,700
I trust to do this right I may get proven wrong in the future but Nintendo is about the only

579
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,620
company that's doing it right so I think I'll continue to buy Nintendo games the day they

580
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:25,060
come out but everybody else can go fuck themselves until they figure this out all right unless it's

581
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:32,100
a Dragon Age game no oh no I won't be buying Dragon Age day one either trust I I am well

582
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,260
and that's that's fine I'm not telling anyone else they have to do anything I'm saying I've had it

583
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:43,220
and I'll buy Dragon Age once I hear once I get the validation it's fine it works you know it's it's

584
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,820
okay well and you know me any of those games I don't play on console anyway yeah I know and a

585
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,700
lot of there have been a lot of people saying that that a lot of people playing on Steam are having

586
00:57:53,700 --> 00:58:00,420
an okay time of it yeah but what again if you get past all this bullshit like I said there's a great

587
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,620
game in there just like just like Dark Soccer just like Mass Effect Andromeda it was a great game it

588
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:11,780
got ruined it got ruined by all this bullshit and it's it I feel like the guy in Twin Peaks

589
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:17,300
and the Red Lodge sitting there going or sorry the Black Lodge going it's happening again it is

590
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:26,500
happening again I I am gonna say my Andromeda worked perfectly as well from day one so all

591
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,820
right I've been very preachy I'm sorry there's gonna be people that are like Rob's too preachy

592
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:36,340
I have feelings okay I just think that we should also bear in mind that for some people your

593
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:42,580
mileage may vary yes that is true and um and maybe maybe you don't give a shit because you

594
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,140
have unlimited bandwidth good for you good for you know because I would like to know what part

595
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:54,260
of the world well they would like to be a part of that world they live in I installed 96 gigabytes

596
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,860
on my virtual machine and there's a very good play there's a very good chance folks in the northeast

597
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:06,420
who have Comcast haven't had because uh Comcast ended up pushing back that bandwidth cap thing

598
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,300
until next year because they were under pressure with coronavirus and everything that's great for

599
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:17,140
the northeast love you guys but what the fuck about the rest of us and this and my anger

600
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:24,180
is just as much directed to cable internet providers and the fact that in many parts of

601
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:29,540
the country we don't have choice on so we're stuck with a lot of this stuff especially in this you

602
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:35,380
know very internet tuned in age where that cap hasn't really changed I think they might have

603
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,260
said oh we bumped it up 10 percent big fucking deal I have some suggestions for you offline

604
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:45,540
yeah I know well there's some other things but we'll talk offline about that so anyway

605
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,900
all right um I've preached enough I'm sorry but I have I had feelings I got something to say

606
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,420
I do actually have something that I want to bring up if that's okay just a quick thing

607
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,060
yes I'm sorry I'm just now looking at I was so preachy I wasn't looking at my watch go ahead

608
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:07,780
Darcyra it's all right so um oh hi Renee Renee's in chat who I haven't seen in a long time me neither

609
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:15,300
um but um as everyone knows I'm from Alabama and we've uh talked to uh my mama son before

610
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:25,380
she sang a song for us um well one of uh one of her roommates that there's you know uh my mama

611
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:32,660
son my papa son uh another friend and then uh uh another friend who's actually been mama son's

612
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:41,380
best friend for a long time um but she is in hospital on a ventilator due to pneumonia and

613
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:48,580
covid and um I would just like some good vibes if y'all don't mind just some good vibes to

614
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:56,660
send uh k kitty's way I'm very sorry to hear that yeah she's she's my best an amazing person

615
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:03,060
you know she's one of those people that's better than she thinks she is so good vibes please and

616
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:09,140
please please get vaccinated please like yes yes like I know people that the vaccines are

617
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,780
experimental no the mr mrna stuff's been researched for years and if you've ever

618
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:19,380
taken a flu shot there's a new one of those every year as well so guess what like the the

619
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:25,780
vaccine's been around long enough like like just get the vaccine just all right yeah well and

620
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:35,300
thankfully I mean the rollout for vaccines in Alabama has been atrocious um thankfully finally

621
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:40,820
somebody in that house is vaccinated or on the way to being vaccinated my mother still hasn't

622
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:50,260
been she's like I can't find a place to do it and so wow I'm really disappointed I'm I'm and that's

623
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:56,420
I'm glad to hear a mild word knowing your mom and knowing um because I it blows my mind the vaccines

624
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,300
have become a political issue and that is so frustrating but knowing that your mom has a

625
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,860
certain stance when it comes to politics I'm really glad to hear and this is something I'm

626
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,100
hearing more and more which I'm very thankful is that people's parents as their kids are like

627
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,860
fuck yeah I'm getting vaccinated people's parents are kind of like coming around a little bit so

628
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:19,860
like I'm I'm really happy to hear that I'm sorry about the fact she can't find one right now but

629
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:27,700
I'm really happy to hear that she's open to getting one yeah um and I'm I'm trying to do a little bit

630
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:36,500
of you know digging uh on her behalf and uh I I don't know it's just I'm really worried and this

631
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,820
one hits really close to home because if I was still in Alabama who knows what state I'd be in

632
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:49,380
sure sure yeah so again it goes back to seriousness um and if I remember correctly I think she's

633
01:02:50,340 --> 01:03:00,580
in her late 50s I think this friend of mine so just be get vaccinated get your friends and

634
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:11,940
parents and whoever harp on them so just do it um because I know I'm going to be heartbroken

635
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:18,340
if if I lose my friend all right well I I really really hope she comes around so fingers not to be

636
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:26,420
a bummer no it's it's it's one of those nights here at OLR sorry we have feelings yeah I'm just

637
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,700
laughing at a just because I don't know what other expression to have right now um anyway

638
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,420
uh I will say you know what the nice thing about being vaccinated um you know uh Allen and I are

639
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,140
both he got a shot uh his second shot and he's he's through the motions where he's fully vaccinated

640
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:46,660
I'm fully vaccinated we actually went to a small gathering of uh also other vaccinated people last

641
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:52,020
night probably like eight people I know in the area it felt so good you guys it's been like a

642
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:56,340
year and a half and it's like the extrovert in me was like you know and we were only there for like

643
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,980
an hour because it was a chance thing we went out to dinner downtown and it was like a friend

644
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,580
messaged and said you should come over and we like fuck yeah we will everybody's vaxxed right yep

645
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:12,580
okay let's do it so um it felt so good so I'm it's like it's a taste of what the other side can look

646
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:18,980
like if people will just please please get the vaccine all right I ran into a friend after I

647
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:28,420
was almost past my uh second vaccine and uh uh and he had been vaccinated and I just and we

648
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:34,340
just both went screw it and gave each other a hug and it's one of the first non-friend hugs I have

649
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:43,060
had in almost two years um Bobby Black Wolfenchat says and I can also explain to you why Costco

650
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,860
asking if you're vaccinated is not a HIPAA violation that is correct that is not a HIPAA

651
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,580
violation and as somebody who worked in the healthcare industry for 18 years and designed

652
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,780
HIPAA training for a company with thousands of employees that took the HIPAA training I will

653
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,380
stress to you HIPAA has to do with information and how it is conveyed from one health insurance

654
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:08,100
entity or I'm sorry excuse me a covered entity which means a healthcare provider or a healthcare

655
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:14,900
clearinghouse anybody handing handling healthcare data to another it has nothing to do with um

656
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,780
disclosures personal disclosure your own personal disclosures you can that me telling you I got

657
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:25,220
vaccinated that's not a fucking HIPAA violation because that's me disclosing it to you and Costco

658
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:28,580
asking that question to you is not a HIPAA violation because they're not doing anything

659
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,540
with your health insurance information that's a question they're asking you so you can get

660
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,100
through the door that is their policy and they have the right to set it as when I was a massage

661
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:41,140
therapist I also had to adhere to HIPAA which basically meant that some third party could not

662
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:48,340
come to me and ask about someone's medical conditions we signed the document I did not

663
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:57,860
disclose it basically HIPAA is a huge NDA on a personal level yeah one could argue that if Costco

664
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:03,060
then told what you said to somebody else then they would be violating HIPAA but actually Costco is not

665
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:09,460
really they they're not a they're not storing your data so it's a very different situation but anyway

666
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,060
we can get into the nuances if you'd like but I'd rather talk about video games right now

667
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:20,260
get my mind off of this all right let's talk HIPAA nuances no no we've had enough off topic tonight

668
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,220
all right let's get into past seven o'clock and not even on our first fucking story so Loki

669
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:32,500
please all right so uh I don't know this isn't really much of a shock I think but Sony is saying

670
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:37,940
that they expect that the PlayStation 5 shortage is going to continue into next year the reason

671
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:45,780
for that is the continuing chip shortage and the um the demand still staying quite high through

672
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:56,260
2021 so basically the financial chief officer uh Hiroki uh Toki basically said that um I don't

673
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,500
think the demand is coming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many

674
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:07,220
more units of PlayStation 5 next year our supply won't be able to catch up with demand so continue

675
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:18,020
to expect um ridiculous queues and scalpers yay but I mean to be fair I mean not a lot of games

676
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:23,780
coming out like I don't know it I still wonder when some of these first party like really big

677
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:28,820
titles are coming out there I mean Returnal came out I guess recently but like more of

678
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:35,620
system seller type things like I haven't yet seen anything necessarily that I needed to have day one

679
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:40,740
even with the series x which I did get you know at launch there wasn't really anything that's like

680
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:47,860
oh my god I gotta get this system because of this right now yeah so I I'll have to wait and see um

681
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,340
She-Hulk 10 in chat is uh saying it's not a chip shortage they just don't want to pay more for the

682
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:57,700
chips yeah they don't want to their loss is only so much that they're willing to lose it no it's

683
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,860
still it's still a shortage because being that the supply is low that the demand is high that

684
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,980
the prices go up so it's still technically a shortage it's just that you know they don't want

685
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:16,020
to pay the the inflated price because of the shortage but you know you hopefully you know with

686
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:23,140
maybe the interest in cryptocurrency I don't know if it's waning it's still pretty popular um but I

687
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:29,940
know there's just a lot of demand right now so maybe that we'll see more factories you know or

688
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,580
I don't know if it's necessarily the you know the manufacturing of it or the actual silicon that's

689
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:40,740
you know in short supply but I guess we'll have to wait and see if it calms down sounds very 80s

690
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:46,420
Nintendo I'm I'm really glad and I'm not gonna usually hype up what this guy says at all but I

691
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,060
am gonna give my polite golf clap to um Elon Musk who's been quite the face of a lot of this

692
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,380
cryptocurrency stuff at least he's been using his platform to kind of say in these past few days

693
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,060
hey we need to look at something that's more green and that's something that's not like using

694
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:04,580
so damn much energy when it comes to this cryptocurrency stuff so I will give one round

695
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:10,580
of polite applause to at least folks that have a voice to be able to um realize that something's

696
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:15,460
got to change with all that craziness uh when it and look I'm guilty of it too I've gotten in on

697
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:20,900
the cryptocurrency thing just a little bit uh but I don't mind it you know I I've been basically

698
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:28,020
legalized gambling with it uh is is what it is so uh just tell them to stop putting brain uh

699
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,980
chips and pig heads and chickens and all that yeah anyway anyway um but back to the PlayStation

700
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:39,620
issue um I will say uh you know I'm bummed because yeah I'd like to pick up a PlayStation 5

701
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:43,140
especially with Returnal I've been watching friends play that and stream it and it looks

702
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,020
like a lot of fun and a type of game I'd be into it looks really cool but I like I just I'm like

703
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,060
I'm not gonna fight scalpers and all this stuff there's still that part of me it's like I will

704
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,460
get a PlayStation when I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf that then I'll know

705
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:01,300
it's for me um I don't really want to play these fucking games now if Final Fantasy 16 releases

706
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:06,500
this year I reserve the right to change my tune but I don't think it will and I don't think I will

707
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,020
so um but we'll see we'll see I'm not I'm not gonna say it as definitively as I said the other

708
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:16,420
thing I'm gonna regret um but if I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf I'll be

709
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:23,220
happy to do that um let's see uh Pele Hanumea in chat says whichever system had 20 million

710
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:27,700
consoles ready at launch could have won the console wars this gen easily that was always

711
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:34,660
going to be hard during COVID and even though COVID is declining as we're seeing it in the

712
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:39,860
states as more people are getting vaccinated I hope everybody realizes a lot of your gaming

713
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:45,700
consoles don't come from the states they come from other places where maybe COVID vaccinations

714
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:51,060
aren't getting around as much as well so yes COVID is still an issue even if it is an issue

715
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:58,980
in your house right now so um yeah anyhow um okay let's move on and talk a little bit about Xbox

716
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:04,260
because this is one of those things about Xbox as much as I've advocated for them uh on the program

717
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,220
this is one of those things that kind of didn't make sense and I'm kind of glad that they're going

718
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:12,340
to be addressing this and that is with the quick review uh resume excuse me quick resume feature

719
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:17,780
that's the one that allows you to like pick up a game and go which by the way also crashed my mass

720
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:24,980
effect game earlier today but I said I'd move on um the quick resume future is uh allows you to

721
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:29,860
pick up a game without a lot of loading time or waiting and kind of flip from one thing to another

722
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:36,180
um but it's hard to tell like what games are actually in the system's memory right now and

723
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:41,300
what's been pushed out well the good news is uh the quick resume feature is going to be getting

724
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:47,620
a little bit of a facelift with the upcoming Xbox update this month so you can see what games do you

725
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:54,260
currently have suspended on your series x or series s depending on what you're using um that's

726
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:58,820
going to be nice uh especially as more and more games are supposed to be supporting it as well

727
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:05,780
um they say uh in a announcement you will be able to list all the games currently saved in quick

728
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,580
resume and you can also pin that thing on your dashboard so you can get to that quickly which

729
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:16,420
is kind of cool as well uh on a somewhat related note uh Microsoft also released some new themes

730
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:23,220
uh with Xbox one uh excuse me well Xbox one and series x uh including a like anniversary background

731
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:28,260
that lets you uh kind of relive what the old school Xbox look like and uh it's kind of a neat

732
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,980
theme I also really like green so um I've been using that theme lately which is um kind of fun

733
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:41,620
so all right moving on dark sakura I I promised we'd get to this I I've been staring happily at

734
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:49,620
this picture of garris for a little while because he's space husband so basically um with the mass

735
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,820
effect legendary edition launch um of course people are having issues you know you spoke of

736
01:12:54,820 --> 01:13:01,300
your own um but uh a few people are already encountering just some other in-game problems

737
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:08,900
uh one user on uh in a thread on reddit says happens walking around on citadel and spontaneously

738
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:15,780
when interacting to talk with npcs the game just disappears but I can hear the sound and task

739
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:22,100
manager it is not responding and I have to force quit and reload um other people are saying that

740
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:29,220
they're experiencing the same thing um several are saying that they're unable to uh launch the game

741
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:35,540
um and then they have like the the boot going in circles um

742
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:43,860
trying to you know like origin isn't even loading um and you know I wonder if some of that might be

743
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:49,460
why mine's not playing in compatibility mode but then again like I said uh I did by the

744
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:58,020
let's doing the same thing um on steam itself um it'll it'll get to the first boot and then

745
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:06,660
trying to launch the origin client it crashes um but there's other options that people are missing

746
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:17,060
as well so um it only supports the combat and interactive gameplay in 21.9 the cut scenes though

747
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:26,420
all go back to 16.9 using uh pillar boxes um the aspect ratio basically this one I like the term

748
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:35,620
for this they're saying it gives a sense of visual whiplash um and no one has made anything about it

749
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:41,780
um there's no graphical options no forced mouse acceleration no field of view slider

750
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:50,180
pillar box ultra wide um so yeah people are just talking about mods and patches to fix the port so

751
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:59,540
I'm I'm kind of glad that I'm not gonna play it yet um and I'm actually just watching like a little

752
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:10,500
video of people going through this so um I hear myself echoing anyway um at any rate though I think

753
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:21,700
that uh there's a lot for them to fix we're gonna see more more patches and I mean I wouldn't be

754
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,900
surprised that even if this is something that's on purpose that there's gonna be something up on

755
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:33,540
nexus to change it too I mean I don't know if these people are playing full screen or playing

756
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:39,220
windowed or what have you I mean there's a reason why I typically play my games windowed anyway

757
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:47,300
I get a little bit less of of that uh that massive change but even so I mean I'm on an

758
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,300
ultra wide screen monitor what's gonna happen when I try to play it you know

759
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:58,900
hopefully the modders have fixed the game since apparently it wasn't totally done I I don't know

760
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:04,660
it's just it's and and here's the bummer here's the real bummer especially when I'm talking to

761
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:11,060
people like bobby who is like I've always been I'm paraphrasing what I'm hearing um but bobby's

762
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:15,700
like you know I the way you guys talk about mass effect all the fucking time maybe there's

763
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,780
something I'm missing maybe I ought to pick this up maybe I ought to play this legendary edition

764
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:27,620
now that it's in 4k and it's pretty and I hate I hate to say give it like three months because

765
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:33,700
he may not be interested in three months and he may mean you know but but the reality is is that

766
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,860
it's unfortunately I think it's gonna take a little while for them to get these problems

767
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:43,460
fixed and it's just like one of those bummers where it's like I wish they would have had it

768
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:48,900
right on day one and I'm not telling people wait three months for them to do all the patches that

769
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:56,420
will definitively fix the game well see and now I want to go back on my uh my virtual computer and

770
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:04,020
try to load the first mass effect um but I mean when I was playing through mass effect two and

771
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:11,620
three um because I think they were easier to mod those two I had basically super high res

772
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:24,580
mods that would work in 1080 right and I I don't see how like what did they reprogram it's the same

773
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:30,100
engine they boosted graphics pretty much I mean they might have I mean the the first one of course

774
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:38,020
was revamped to work on that engine but I don't really I don't really get it you know well they

775
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:42,660
went in under the hood and did stuff to combat and the Mako so I mean I think they did more

776
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:51,060
with that one than two and three but yeah but yeah but I don't know it's just I I guess I'm

777
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:59,060
having a hard time phrasing what I want to say I it makes my heart hurt it's just it's just

778
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:03,860
disappointment because we know there is a good game in there and we know this shouldn't be

779
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:13,460
happening but it does and it's it's frustrating to put it lightly it's like it's like when you're

780
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:20,740
served like a layered casserole and the top layer is like half cooked turnips but underneath that

781
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:25,780
you got some lamb you got some chicken and some cheese or something you just need to

782
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:34,340
get past the turnips what was that trifle with beef and potatoes all right let's move on to the

783
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:44,100
next story which I think Loki's talking about yeah so Target has decided to post where they're

784
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:51,220
discontinuing selling Pokemon cards at their physical locations right now and this is

785
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:56,260
including actually a lot of different type of collector cards because they've had issues with

786
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:01,460
grown adults fighting each other in parking lots trying to get some of these more sought after

787
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,900
packs so apparently the restriction kicked in earlier this week they're going to no longer

788
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:14,660
sell the NFL, NBA, MLB, and Pokemon cards except online you can order them through their online

789
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:19,860
stores they just don't want you coming to their locations and having altercations in the parking

790
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:27,220
lot because you really wanted you know some foil card or something like that so it's grown adults

791
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,740
I mean what are you gonna do but yeah that's I think they're not the only store too I think

792
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:39,220
Walmart's also been cracking down on selling stuff as well so it's just can we just please

793
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:46,340
act like adults please I mean come on act Efton chat says the summary to the story FU scalpers

794
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:52,660
and E3VL in chat says scalpers need to keep themselves in check Quest Buster says this is

795
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:57,780
why we can't have nice things and Tiger Claw says it's because those cards have gone up in value

796
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:03,620
all of that yeah like it's the scalping culture I bet a lot of those people fighting over cards

797
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,780
are just going to flip them online and so they see it as money and people trying to steal their

798
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:13,860
money and when people try to steal money they want to fight about it and this is probably where

799
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:20,580
a lot of the scalping stuff has to get fixed too and ebay and facebook markets and all these things

800
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,180
really need to come together to figure out what they're going to do about scalping but you know

801
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:31,140
of course others will say well there's not a lot you can do um one thing I do like though what was

802
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,420
it there was a store I bought something on recently and it had I think it was actually

803
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:42,820
Square Enix when I bought the expansion for Endwalker actually um who's who's who's getting

804
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,660
a lot of praise from me tonight for doing things right and this is another one I wasn't even

805
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:52,580
planning but I bought the expansion and it actually texted me a code to my phone because

806
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:56,420
it was just kind of like we just need to um check this order I don't know what it was actually

807
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:01,140
checking behind the scenes or whatever but it texted me a code and I had to put in that code

808
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:08,420
but I noticed by doing that it also is making sure that I have a number in the region that I'm trying

809
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:14,740
to buy the game in uh that I'm only getting one that I'm one person and it also kind of slows

810
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:20,580
things down because I have to put in this code and all this stuff so I would love to see more

811
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:25,140
retailers kind of do this force two-factor verification which kind of slows the process

812
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:28,820
of buying things down so it's hard to do and yes I know there will be some people that are still

813
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,740
probably able to find a way around it and so forth but it will really cut down their their speed of

814
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:40,740
that sort of thing I think so uh ZenMonkey11 says they can't stop it it's the culture only the fans

815
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:47,140
can stop it and uh you know there there is there is very much truth in the fact that if this wanted

816
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:52,580
to end tomorrow it could if everybody could just agree to not buy from scalpers anymore

817
01:21:53,540 --> 01:22:00,340
but unfortunately there's some people that are going to do whatever they want to get their kid

818
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:06,580
their damn Pokemon card um and that's another part of our culture that's kind of disappointing

819
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:14,020
I guess uh yeah Tiger Claw says the problem is eBay is enabling all this I agree but they're

820
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:18,340
making money off of it this might be a thing where the government has to step in and regulate

821
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:23,060
it or at least do that thing where they threaten if you don't fix this problem we will that's what

822
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:27,780
I'd like to see happen if you don't fix this problem we will you're starting to see a little

823
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:32,020
bit of that because I do believe the current administration or congress one of the two maybe

824
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:40,420
both kind of have said that this whole chip shortage stuff this is an issue fix it so there

825
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:48,340
you see it's starting to go that direction so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on talk

826
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:53,620
about something that's happy and wonderful and that is the upcoming 35th anniversary of Dragon

827
01:22:53,620 --> 01:23:00,180
Quest did you know that series is 35 years old that's exciting and depressing all at once because

828
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:03,620
I don't know about you guys but I have fond memories of playing the first game when it first

829
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,780
came out in America anyway when it was Dragon Warrior and I know we got it a little later but

830
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:13,300
still you know it wasn't wasn't that long after and uh yeah 35 years Dragon Quest will be doing

831
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:19,220
a special 35th anniversary stream on May 26 to celebrate it and they're going to be giving all

832
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:24,660
the latest information on the latest Dragon Quest games so you know keep in mind there's like a

833
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:29,060
Dragon Quest cell phone game uh they're I think they did a Dragon Quest version of theater them

834
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:34,660
at one point in Japan only I don't know but the one that has everybody excited there may maybe

835
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:38,980
there'll be a builders 3 that would be pretty exciting actually but the real thing that has

836
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:44,820
people excited is that could this be a Dragon Quest 12 and there's strong hints that this is

837
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:50,420
going to be an announcement of Dragon Quest 12 of course the last game in the series was uh Dragon

838
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:55,540
Quest 11 uh but that's been out for a little while you know to the point that we're getting these

839
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:02,660
like enhanced of definitive edition re-releases on Xbox when you know it was out on the the switch

840
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:09,300
in Japan and uh the the PlayStation 4 in both regions for quite some time so I'm expecting

841
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,140
that we're going to hear what console the new Dragon Quest game is for if that's going to be

842
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:18,020
a Switch thing as well uh or what they're going if they're going to do Xbox parody as well who knows

843
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:24,900
uh we're going to hear all of that hopefully uh at this stream on um I said 26th of May but

844
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:33,780
actually I'm hearing the event starts at on May 28th at 8 30 pacific time so maybe is there two

845
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,540
of it I think maybe it's just a typo in this story because I'm looking at a big graphic that says

846
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:45,140
May 26th is when this is all happening so um look forward to some news in that capacity um

847
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:50,260
Dr Tetsuya in chat says I did finally get around to finishing Dragon Quest 11 this last year yeah

848
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:55,380
you know the Xbox release made me take another look at it so that was fun now if that's not

849
01:24:55,380 --> 01:25:00,180
enough for you how about some Dragon Quest in the real world did you know there is a

850
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:05,460
Dragon Quest island that is going to be opening actually it opened yesterday uh this is the

851
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:13,380
Nijigen no Mori amusement park uh that has this attraction it's this little Dragon Quest land

852
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:20,660
um I guess you it's there's interesting pricing tiers to this uh and then you know some different

853
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:25,140
rides and things uh with all this it's been delayed a little bit because of COVID-19

854
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:31,060
but it did finally open so fun I'd love to visit someday um but probably not going to be anytime

855
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:39,860
soon all right Dark Sakura what do you have for us um I have some stuff about PlayStation and Steam

856
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:49,380
so PlayStation's Steam page is live and there's actually something that's listing number first of

857
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:58,180
all it lists 41 pieces of content but only about half of it is visible so that's 41 games and their

858
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:07,220
DLC associated with the Sony division but there's only 24 things that you can see so um the only ones

859
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:15,060
available to purchase right now is horizon uh horizon zero dawn predator hunting grounds and

860
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:26,260
hell divers um days gone is set to release later in the month but um they uh they're saying that

861
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:30,980
they want a lot more to come out they have a whole bunch of games coming out and it looks like the

862
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:35,940
evidence for it was there it's just this stuff isn't there to see yet I think we've got you know

863
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,620
hidden placeholders or something yeah it's interesting that there's like you know this is

864
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:44,820
going to this level of where they have like their own branded page and stuff and I know um there

865
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:49,700
wasn't as much juicy news out of that court thing this week but one thing we did get it from the

866
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:55,140
court thing last week was uh the whole news about that PlayStation it had a conversation with Steam

867
01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:00,420
and and this looks to be something uh that that could be a result of that I'm sure there were

868
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:05,460
other things discussed too but definitely it seems to be there's um a tighter partnership there and

869
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:13,860
so that's interesting yeah so all right well I think Loki has some more PlayStation things

870
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,700
yeah so this is exciting I'm always trying to figure out what you know they're going to be

871
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:26,900
doing for PlayStation VR too and here's some more like kind of from a reliable source type of thing

872
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:33,940
so Uploaded VR had done a kind of a piece talking about the technology that's going to be

873
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:40,820
in the next PlayStation VR so some of that including foveted rendering which for those

874
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:46,580
who don't know it's using eye tracking to render just the highest resolution image

875
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:52,420
where you're directly looking and then everything around that would be lower resolution and then as

876
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:58,260
you change where you're looking at it would actually alter where it's rendering the highest

877
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:03,300
you know resolution part of that image so it allows it to save some bandwidth being able to

878
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:08,740
just render um a smaller section of the screen at a higher resolution with everything else being

879
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:14,820
a little bit less um in focus I guess uh they're saying that that sounds like straight up science

880
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:21,540
fiction that's crazy yeah it's pretty crazy um they had the uh there's gonna be an IPD adjustment

881
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:26,500
dial which is kind of uh typical with a lot of the headsets out there uh per eye resolution they're

882
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:32,660
saying is uh 2,000 by 2040 pixels um they're doing the inside out tracking kind of like the

883
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:38,500
most modern um headsets out there right now uh also they're saying that they're going to have

884
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:43,300
the haptic feedback which I assume is going to be the same type of stuff that we had um with the

885
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:50,580
DualSense 4 controllers so uh I'm sorry they're new uh controllers that they have that have that

886
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:54,500
enhanced haptic feedback I'm assuming those are going to be in the new controllers that they

887
01:28:54,500 --> 01:29:02,020
put out images for not too long ago um it's still going to be a wired headset which is fine but

888
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:07,140
being that technology has gotten a lot better than what it was with the original PlayStation VR

889
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:15,700
it's just one USB type-c cable I believe which I think that's pretty manageable um what else that

890
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:24,580
we don't know when it's coming out yet of course not of course not and uh you know haven't really

891
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:31,300
seen anything confirmed yet these are just you know like I said you know from a reliable source

892
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:36,820
right now so it's all rumors and speculation until we actually get some news from Sony but

893
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:43,060
maybe this year maybe we'll find out I'm assuming some next year maybe yeah I would be shocked if

894
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:48,740
PSVR is a thing for this year I really especially in light of the continuing supply issues and

895
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:54,340
things like that um I think it'd be really wild to try to put out a VR unit when you can't put

896
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:59,540
out enough consoles to meet the demand so I I would say for that reason alone PlayStation VR

897
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:06,500
for PlayStation 5 has to be at least another year out um but I I don't make sure bets on anything

898
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:15,860
anymore exactly well I mean it's just it sounds cool I hope all that's true now um some interesting

899
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:21,300
perspective in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network uh Bobby Blackwolf our pal uh

900
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:29,380
in chat is saying um that uh I'm very interested in seeing how this will work with my astigmatism

901
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:35,140
which means my eyes jiggle a lot I haven't tried any eye tracking headsets yet and you know what

902
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:39,940
Bobby uh is talking about there that's not exactly an uncommon thing there's a there's quite a few

903
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:46,980
people out there with astigmatism uh that uh I deal with it yeah and so so what's gonna happen

904
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:52,020
you know is there a way to turn this feature off that Loki's talking about or is it gonna

905
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:56,660
compensate for that somehow or I I don't know because I don't develop this stuff um but it'd be

906
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,980
some of those accessibility type of things are very interesting questions

907
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:06,740
especially when we're talking about new technology with VR I mean I I hope everybody gets to enjoy

908
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:11,700
it I would assume though it's very fast I mean assuming that most of these a lot of the newer

909
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:18,100
headsets you know render at about 120 megahertz I mean that's that's pretty fast I think that's

910
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:23,540
a lot faster than your eye can move so I would assume that assuming that the eye tracking is

911
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:28,020
that good and it would have to be if it's you know putting the rendering or it's basing the

912
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:33,860
rendering where you're looking um that's going to be interesting it's also going to be interesting

913
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:38,500
that they sell that data and use you know advertisements like oh let's we can now measure

914
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:42,980
advertising your advertisement engagement and stuff like that yeah that's pretty dicey there's

915
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:48,820
lots of evil yeah uh evil possibilities Bobby in chat says you don't know how fast my eyes can move

916
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:54,420
against my will well I will say this I I look to Bobby to be a voice on this because I know he's a

917
01:31:54,420 --> 01:32:00,100
huge VR enthusiast he talks a lot about it on his show he works a lot with VR stuff um so so I know

918
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:06,020
I'm going to get the answer from Bobby uh when uh the PS gets closer to release and I imagine you

919
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,700
know I don't think they're going to talk about any of this on a big stage but I imagine they will

920
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:14,020
address some of the stuff behind the scenes when it comes to things like accessibility and what

921
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:20,900
about this what about that you know um it'll be it'll be interesting to see so all right well let

922
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,820
us move on and I'm going to talk a little bit about speaking of announcement type of things

923
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:31,700
uh EA Play uh you know they usually do a thing uh it kind of concurrently with e3 because e3's

924
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,780
changed a lot and I'm not just talking about the COVID thing but you know EA started doing their

925
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:40,180
own thing across the street and EA is going to be continuing to do its own thing this year and

926
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:46,660
what's interesting to me is that it's a little ways out it's on July 22nd this time so it's not

927
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:52,020
exactly when e3 is happening which um you know there there's probably great reasons for that

928
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:56,660
probably so they can you know have every additional day to work on trailers and things like that so

929
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:02,420
we'll see um I also think it's interesting they really invoke their old school logo

930
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:07,700
back when they were eca of the square the sphere and the triangle if you didn't know

931
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:12,660
that dates all the way back to eca and what the the loading screen would look like on old games

932
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:17,860
but anyway just a little tangent there uh they did announce it's coming back on july 22nd of course

933
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:22,900
we have no idea what it's going to cover or what games are going to talk about but you know you can

934
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:28,660
assume uh new games and all their big sports franchises that's for sure um probably an update

935
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:32,900
on dragon age quite frankly I think it's a high time to get some more on that maybe that'll

936
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:38,420
actually be a thing this year I don't know um but regardless uh there's going to be a part of me

937
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:41,620
that's skeptical about everything they announce because I'm going to be like oh is it really ready

938
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:45,700
or are they just going to put it out uh before it's done um but we'll see we can make our own

939
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:53,300
judgments in July all right let's let's go back to a simpler time you guys let's take a step back

940
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:58,980
and we're going to visit you know this is a time when you had to get it right the first time because

941
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:04,100
your game was burned to a cartridge and unable to be patched really until years and years and

942
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:08,180
years later now we have that technology but not back then uh it's the classic game of the week

943
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:13,060
and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids

944
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:19,860
should be checking this game out uh and this this I gotta say dark soccer it's I did I didn't know

945
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:24,900
this game that you picked tonight this is a pretty obscure one for me maybe I did I just picked

946
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:31,940
something that people might not have heard of um it's not even like the best game but it's it's

947
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,900
neat I'll say it's it's different it's different so anyway but please let's get to it so the classic

948
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:42,660
game of the week is called Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch um because there's an ellipsis so I had

949
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:51,700
to pause so at any rate um it is a video game that came out for game boy and the SNES in 1993

950
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:59,060
um it actually is another one of those games that didn't come out in Japan it's a side-scrolling

951
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:04,740
platform game about a French chef collecting ingredients for his dishes by going to different

952
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:11,940
countries to catch them since they have escaped um I'll go into other editions of that but it came

953
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:22,340
out in November 1993 in the U.S. and September 93 in Europe so it was uh European first um and

954
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:30,900
I don't think we got the game boy version in the U.S. we uh I think it was only um only in Europe

955
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:41,460
but um in 1994 it did get a release on the Amiga and the Amiga CD32 so it's it's kind of a

956
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:50,740
who who knows these games right um so at any rate um there is a single-player mode and a two-player

957
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:58,100
alternating mode so either way you play as Pierre Le Chef and you have to capture a certain number

958
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:03,860
of your ingredients before your time runs out so kind of like a little bubble bobbly you know

959
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:10,980
um the way that the levels are set up so you know you jump from platforms around and you have to

960
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:17,940
capture everything and you know you've got some you know you have basically you can set them on

961
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:25,940
fire too which is pretty fun um anyway though uh you uh you have to catch them in a net and

962
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:31,860
put them into a cage in the level and then in every level though you have to find the net

963
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:36,980
first before you can catch something so once you have all of your ingredients then you get a door

964
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:46,900
that pops up to the next level you will encounter some baddies including germs and bacteria where

965
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:52,500
if you get touched by them you lose your life the bacteria can also turn your ingredients into

966
01:36:52,500 --> 01:37:02,500
hostile enemies so you have to watch out for spoiled food hehe and then there's also the

967
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:11,060
uh arch nemesis chef chef le noir um who will uh show up to hinder your process

968
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:18,500
um you can also get weapons like uh hot sauce and bags of flour you can use to

969
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:25,220
stun your ingredients and the bacteria so you have to basically take him all the way

970
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:31,700
through uh various places um Switzerland Greece Jamaica of course in this game is known as West

971
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:39,300
Indies um Mexico China and then France you have eight levels you have to navigate through in each

972
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:44,580
country and at the end of each country you can play a bonus game where you can get more points

973
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:49,700
for extra lives so once you lose all your lives or complete the game then you're given a final

974
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,980
scorecard that says how many points you got throughout the game and then you get a high

975
01:37:54,980 --> 01:38:05,060
square ranking so there's not much out for like big reviews on this one um like uh game rankings

976
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:15,700
gave this a 59.5 um but you know it's cute and I thought you know as much as we love our our bubble

977
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:21,780
bobbles and various games as such this really makes me think of it but like a little bit of

978
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:28,020
mappy thrown in and just I mean it's a fun little unique platformer I thought

979
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:37,060
um and and again it's one of those games that had the distinction of being a fully uh western

980
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:44,100
release the music was giving me um adventure island vibes too kind of yeah yeah apparently

981
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:50,900
the um Amiga CD 32 version looks really good but I mean I think we're looking at the SNES version

982
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:57,460
we are yeah and it's don't look half bad it looks like early SNES you know because it kind of is

983
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:01,700
but it kind of looks like a port of an Amiga game which is what I find interesting about

984
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:06,820
this selection is that there weren't a ton of Super Nintendo games like this but um ironically

985
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:11,220
one you've picked recently Lost Vikings is another one that gives me that vibe where you can kind of

986
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:17,220
tell it's a computer game ported for the Super Nintendo um SimCity is strangely an example of

987
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:24,260
that but not not as much because SimCity had that Nintendo flair thrown in as well um but anyhow I

988
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:29,460
digress well another one about this is that the company Mindscape uh actually started off as an

989
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:39,140
American company and then uh was acquired by a French owner so it's now um located in uh

990
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:47,940
um it so it's a French this game is actually a French developed uh uh game they did like the

991
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:55,380
the MacVenture series Moonstone uh Warhammer Shadow of the Horned Rat a few a few uh

992
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:01,540
Warhammer and Lego Island so it's pretty it's just pretty interesting you know I

993
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:08,340
it's something that I've noticed though is that European developed games in general like during

994
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:15,860
the 16-bit era had the same kind of look and feel for the most part maybe that's what it is

995
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:21,700
it's not so much a PC you know equivalent or Amiga equivalent um but it's the European well

996
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:27,300
Commodore was so huge in Europe that an Amiga port almost kind of goes hand in hand anyway I

997
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:31,860
digress again sorry but I was just thinking maybe this is more like you can just kind of tell it's a

998
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:37,780
Europe uh kind of developed game well my other thing too is that you know the only thing that

999
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:41,460
doesn't make this distinctly European is that there's no dropping water to kill you

1000
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:52,100
but anyway um so yeah it's a cute game um like the again you'll see it as out to lunch but the

1001
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:58,340
full name of it is Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch I wonder does anybody in chat have memories of

1002
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:02,180
this game because you know I did not know this game but when I was looking for the video the

1003
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:06,180
b-roll of it and yeah you'll have a easier time kind of finding information on it if you look

1004
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:11,540
for out to lunch as opposed to the full name um but uh I saw like a lot of YouTube comments that

1005
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:16,580
were like oh I love this game when I was a kid or this you know so even if something has a low

1006
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:21,300
you know Metacritic score or whatever there's just certain games that are always going to take us

1007
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:26,420
back you know like there are games that didn't review well on Metacritic that I love um the NES

1008
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:32,900
port of Ultima Exodus is a great example um it doesn't review well at all but I have huge memories

1009
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:39,540
of that game there's always gonna be a special place friend who had this oh cute and we would we

1010
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:44,580
would do the the two-player mode I mean I really didn't play it a whole lot but I had seen this pop

1011
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:52,100
up not too terribly long ago and I was like oh that game was cute I sucked at it um and so I decided

1012
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:59,780
to throw it in because it's you know the the Nintendo library in and of itself for Super

1013
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:07,060
Nintendo is bigger than you think it is oh yeah um and I like to find just these little things that

1014
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:14,580
might have flown under your own radar and say hey you know yeah bust out that retron or or the 400

1015
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:21,220
you might have paid for the analog um a bobby black wolf is in chat and being a little bit

1016
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:27,140
tongue-in-cheek or sassy asking some questions here such as it says I have questions such as

1017
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:31,700
what causes these foods to escape why are we only sending a chef after these sentient foods

1018
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:36,580
what happens if these escaped foods spend too much time in the sun and why do we not air drop

1019
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:40,660
the chef into this war zone without a net is it Billy Mitchell hot sauce I think talking about

1020
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:46,020
one of the foods there does it's on-site requisition and what does the BurgerTime

1021
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:50,500
universe think of this development of more sentient foods that's it's it's hard to not

1022
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,860
make the BurgerTime comparison when looking at this game about you know chef fighting bad food

1023
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:59,940
for sure you know you know what I think of every time I see the little eggs rolling is I think of

1024
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:07,060
weebl and bob remember back when I used to do the website of the month oh yeah that was back in the

1025
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:14,420
day that was before your little uh facts you had the facts on the early days of the podcast

1026
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:18,900
I don't know if that was a life lesson or whatever that was yeah yeah maybe I should start giving out

1027
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:24,900
life advice again but this time I should charge for it um but but anyway I okay so the big rocks

1028
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:30,020
are truffles this is definitely a French game anyway um they look like rocks but I always just

1029
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,900
call them rocks like why is it eating rocks but they're truffles um but the eggs make me think

1030
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:40,020
of weebl and bob which I did review the uh the website and actually one of the the folks that

1031
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:48,500
works on it you know reached out to to us so um but yeah the eggs make me think of uh of bob rolling

1032
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:55,780
in little nice all right so there it is your classic game of the week out to lunch or um

1033
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:02,980
the full name one more time um Pierre le chef is out to lunch all right thank you very much great

1034
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:08,100
pick all right it's fun to learn about new games sometimes too even years and years after the fact

1035
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:14,340
all right yeah the truffle also kind of looks like a big poo all right let's uh travel around the

1036
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:18,980
world and quickly check out some rapid fire news and some quick headlines loki will start with you

1037
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:26,660
yeah so as you can see in my background here um ghoul patrol and zombies ate me neighbors uh that's

1038
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:33,220
a brand new uh collection that's going to be released now on uh playstation 4 xbox one switch

1039
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:42,180
and pc june 29th coming thanks to uh limited run games um they're also going to be doing a uh

1040
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:49,620
physical version of that a little bit later on as well um if you can find that and then um yeah so

1041
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:55,620
it's going to be coming with the two games so one of which i've only played i don't know too much

1042
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:00,660
about google patrol other than it looks kind of similar um they're also adding art collection

1043
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:05,780
soundtrack developer interviews and plus they're going to have trophies and achievements and stuff

1044
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:12,500
like that local co-op so uh 14.99 is what that's gonna run you so it looks awesome can't wait to

1045
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:17,140
get that a nice surprise because these are really some cult fate like the zombies ate my neighbors

1046
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:21,380
is like a cult favorite i'm sure dark soccer picked it as a classic game at one point because

1047
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,340
it's or maybe you did when she wasn't here one week but but uh it's really a cult favorite of

1048
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:30,180
uh type of game and uh it's great to see it getting a re-release and some attention again

1049
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:37,380
yeah and so there's always been a lot of uh rom hacks out there and one the more um i guess

1050
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:42,980
popular ones for uh smash is smash remix which is the rom hack of the original smash brothers game

1051
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:49,140
for the nintendo 64 um they've added lots of new characters to the game and the latest character

1052
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:57,140
that they added in there is conquer from conqueror's bad fur day also they have um looks like

1053
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:02,980
wolf O'Donnell is also in there as well so uh pretty cool to see that in the newest update

1054
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:08,980
but yeah it's kind of funny seeing conquer with a chainsaw in a smash brothers game but

1055
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:13,060
i would i would do down for seeing that in a uh modern smash game as well

1056
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:21,620
all right dark soccer what do you have for us well um you know evercade is a cool little

1057
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:29,780
device and their uh their launch lineup has a few people scratching their heads um so of course

1058
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:38,500
they have some traditional stuff like namco museum coming out um but other two that have been listed

1059
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:47,700
recently the uh jalico collection one and the pico collection two um they are pretty classic

1060
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:53,220
but i think you have to kind of stop and think about what you might have played in those series

1061
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:58,500
like for example the uh the jalico one has the original earth defense force unrelated to the

1062
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:05,700
current ones base is loaded a styonax city connection rival turf um and then the pico

1063
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:15,060
one has things like soccer kid and shut up and jam so it's it's got some craziness on there so

1064
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:24,500
if you like those family of games and certainly check it out and then uh sony has new uh ps5

1065
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:32,340
dual sense controllers that they have announced a fied um and i just made up that word so you can

1066
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:40,660
get uh these galaxy inspired colors one of them is midnight black and cosmic red and honestly

1067
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:45,460
they both look pretty sweet although the red one kind of looks like a bathing suit i just bought

1068
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:55,380
um but uh the uh the midnight black will be 70 and the cosmic red will be 75 i mean maybe

1069
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:01,860
red costs more or something i guess it's that red dye but it's it's damn it's gorgeous so don't lick

1070
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:10,100
it yeah yeah but at any rate you know um if you want a little bit more flair to your non-existent

1071
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:16,020
ps5 there you go all right all right now we're going to take a look around the world at some

1072
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,820

1085
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:52,420
still making these games saying people buy them regarding allison do they though because doesn't

1086
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:57,220
this i i could be completely wrong but doesn't this franchise keep changing hands because like

1087
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:02,420
is sold to the lowest bidder because like all these games are turd sure i don't know if it's

1088
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:06,900
this one or like the last one but one of these was a kickstarter i think this may have been that

1089
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:13,540
kickstarter game oh okay i got it all right all right let's go over to japan and check out some

1090
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:17,540
releases over there uh it's it's getting busy i know golden week was a couple weeks ago we had a

1091
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:21,700
kind of slow week after that but it's it's picking back up again so here we go on the switch this

1092
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:28,100
week in japan rune factory 5 regular and limited edition angelique luminous luminarize uh in a

1093
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:33,540
regular and limited edition as well uh akiba's trip hellbound and debriefed in a regular and

1094
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:39,060
10th anniversary limited edition uh the wanderer frankenstein's creature in a regular and special

1095
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:44,740
edition uh and then manifold garden also out on the switch uncharted waters 4 there's some type

1096
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:50,260
of power-up kit that comes with this uh there's a regular hd version and the 30th anniversary

1097
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:56,180
edition that comes with this as well i'm assuming the power-up kit must be an online thing um

1098
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:00,500
because it doesn't look like it's a like some of the peripheral in the box or anything like that

1099
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:06,180
yeah it looks it looks a little bit like a nobunaga type of game but i could i could be

1100
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:09,700
completely missing the mark there i'm seriously looking at just a couple screenshots here it's a

1101
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:14,340
koi tecmo game though so uh and they are the ones with uh nobunaga's ambition so i wouldn't be

1102
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:22,820
surprised if it's um related um let's see also on the switch this week we have um that's it let

1103
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,620
me go to the playstation 5 and 4 and check out releases there mortal shell is out this week in

1104
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:33,140
japan on the playstation 5 and that's it that's the big release on the ps5 this week uh probably

1105
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:36,820

1108
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:57,460

at screenshots to see if i recognize it i oh um is it kid nikki is it that kid kid nikki the

1112
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:23,060

yay a lot of people looking forward to that one yeah but i just like i kind of like wasn't

1122
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:32,900
expecting that because i you know hadn't really been looking too much at the uh some of the

1123
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:40,660
upcoming switch releases um but what what decade did or what year did i pop back into

1124
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:45,940
where we have leisure suit larry and me topia well if you go back to the way way back uh the

1125
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:51,140
original leader suit larry i'm pretty sure was in early 90s maybe even late 80s type of thing

1126
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:59,700
uh and um yeah uh uh the other is a little more recent yeah yeah oh this game's bobby

1127
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:04,980
blackpool's reminding i enjoyed me toby on 3ds dark soccer was the big baddie in my game because

1128
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:09,540
you could you could make your friends the um monsters and i seem to remember a conversation

1129
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:17,380
at e3 or something about this and you ended up being the daddy yeah that's great all right uh

1130
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:23,380
let's move on then we have some more news this first story is is interesting to me but loki

1131
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:31,540
i'll let you talk about it here yeah so sega i guess uh part of their latest financial results

1132
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:38,340
report they had sort of i guess realized that hey they've got a bunch of these really recognizable

1133
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:45,780
ip's that they've been sitting on forever that um perhaps they could remaster remake or reboot them

1134
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:52,420
um they were listing off um you know some examples like crazy taxi jet set radio

1135
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:59,620
uh space channel five rez panther dragon knights shinobi virtue fighter altered beast house of the

1136
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:06,820
dead serisa rage soul hackers etc um basically saying that you know after careful examination

1137
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:14,260
you know we can remade re-release these perhaps people would want to buy our popular games

1138
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:19,220
well they have re-released a lot of those um yeah i understand that but like yeah alan get

1139
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:24,180
to give alan a cheap plug he plays a lot of those games on his uh stream on the music mondays that

1140
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:30,020
he does he i know he's played through space channel five part two uh and uh rez he's done before jet

1141
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:35,700
set radio so like you know they have re-released those two games on steam but how do you not

1142
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:42,340
realize like hey maybe this is a good idea like it seems very obvious to me i don't know oh

1143
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:47,540
i'm sure go on twitter and i'm sure there are plenty of people that are saying who do i have to

1144
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:52,100
bang in the parking lot to get a new jet set radio there's a lot of people that would love love love

1145
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:57,620
to see that so um i hope so i'd love to see a new space channel five to be fair we did get the vr

1146
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:02,660
thing um but i just haven't gotten around to playing the vr thing yet but i know i know there

1147
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:06,500
is that so at least we know it's not forgotten forgotten but yeah i think i think a lot of us

1148
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:11,140
would like to see uh you know some of these old sega classics make a resurgence uh pod culture

1149
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:17,220
and chat uh quite loudly says just do a damn dreamcast mini ffs we all know what that means

1150
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,980
so yeah i think there's a lot of people that would be very excited about that but it has to have the

1151
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:27,860
little the little um thing the tamagotchi thing you take with the vmu thank you uh that you take

1152
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:35,220
with you so all right uh dart to see you in chat says i know people beg hadeke nagah numa uh for

1153
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:39,460
a new one but he just redirects them to sega i mean what's he gonna do about a new jet set radio

1154
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:48,900
that's right yeah yeah go to sega all right more spiritual successors yeah um going on to the next

1155
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:52,980
story which i think this is really cool and i talked earlier about like you know hey more

1156
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:58,980
accessibility type of things is awesome and i i love this uh microsoft is talking about something

1157
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:06,500
they are working on with speech transcription and text-to-speech synthesis for party chat

1158
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:11,140
so xbox insiders actually have access to this which i i think i'm one of those so i need to

1159
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:15,940
go look and see if i have access to this even though i i hardly ever talk with people on xbox

1160
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,900
i don't know what i'd use it on um but maybe it would work on pc uh presumably i don't know but

1161
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:26,260
anyway i think this is great uh so this feature is going to make it easier for people who maybe

1162
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:31,140
you know have hearing or speech difficulties they can actually read what's coming up in party chat

1163
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:37,060
because it's being live transcribed on the screen uh these features are in the ease of access tab

1164
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:42,580
under game and chat transcription uh with this on words spoken in a party are converted to text

1165
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:47,700
displayed in an adjustable overlay uh and if you have text-to-speech enabled anything you type in

1166
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:53,300
party text chat will be read by a synthetic voice to the rest of the party so it's a way for you to

1167
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:59,460
have a speaking voice as well if you want um so that's really cool and uh a feature i'd like to

1168
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:05,460
play around with i love that i would love to have transcriptions of this podcast available

1169
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:11,620
unfortunately the reality is all the services that offer it um are way too expensive like you know

1170
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:16,020
and i get you know people don't do work for free so it has to and all these services i'm looking

1171
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:22,180
at are actual people working so i get it but the problem is um a three hour or you know at worse

1172
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:27,060
maybe two and a half two hour whenever on some weeks this podcast like it's really expensive so

1173
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:31,380
i just i can't afford it but if there were some type of like automated way to do it which somebody

1174
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:37,140
was telling me to use youtube to do the transcriptions and um i it's not youtube isn't

1175
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:43,940
great at it but it might be a start um so yeah i i would love to have that um just even for this

1176
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:49,860
show check on some options yeah that'd be cool just if it costs money the answer's no all right

1177
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:58,260
the answer might be maybe all right um depends on who's fronting it yeah so um all right let's move

1178
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:04,660
on uh i think this one's two years dark talker yeah i was just about to start it now this is

1179
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:14,100
already passed so this was actually for friday uh may 14th um itch.io uh held its first ever creator

1180
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:22,420
day which i don't know how that went um but they were they went to forego its usual cut of sales

1181
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:28,820
um so a hundred percent of any transactions that day after taxes and payment processing fees

1182
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:38,340
were going directly back to the creators so basically it was a good way to to put these

1183
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:42,740
indie developers give them a little bit more money in their pocket i mean and the thing with

1184
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:50,500
um with itch.io already is that they have a default 10 cut of sales but it could go

1185
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:57,140
between zero and 100 depending on what the developer wanted to do um and so they take a

1186
01:59:57,140 --> 02:00:04,180
much smaller cut than the 30 industry standard um so i thought it was really cool that you know

1187
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:11,220
they gave back yeah i was gonna say i'd known about it i know i wish i'd known we would have

1188
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:16,340
hyped your game more to get uh sold then but uh s is showing her matt does remind us in chat

1189
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:22,020
speaking of itch.io loki's game is on it and drops the link there to uh buy pixel poops number two

1190
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:27,620
i appreciate that and i sold uh just reordered my labels because they got screwed up the first time

1191
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:33,220
so still working on that physical edition all right nice all right well maybe we'll do another

1192
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:38,980
one of those uh creators day again uh in the future that would sure be nice all right meanwhile loki

1193
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:45,780
all right so um you know this is kind of funny because it's almost like a meme here but

1194
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:51,780
uh we we remember the ever given container ship on the suis canal well apparently uh

1195
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:58,420
nintendo's switch shipments were impacted by that now i might say though that's a likely story

1196
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:03,860
nintendo that your your shipments were this is the reason why there's a shortage on your consoles

1197
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:12,980
right it's because of this um i'm skeptical if you may say um but apparently they said yes that

1198
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:19,460
that caused delays for the product in europe and some of the uh inventories are a little bit tighter

1199
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:28,580
in those countries sure sure nintendo we'll believe you this time but i'm skeptical i'm on to you

1200
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:35,540
you think it's just a convenient excuse i'm sure that they'll say that the ever given like the

1201
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:39,780
digital version of the ever given is just like it's just jammed into the e-shop that's why we

1202
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:44,340
got to take down mario you know in march because it's just that mario games just can't get through

1203
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:51,620
there so i don't know i don't i'll believe them this time uh bobby blackwolf in chat says remember

1204
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:56,020
that ship didn't just block its own stuff it blocked all ships yes it wasn't just about the

1205
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:01,620
one ship that was stuck but obviously it caused a traffic jam uh but like the worst possible kind

1206
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:08,820
that went on for weeks really um no so yeah it's just like nintendo always has hardware shortages

1207
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:14,100
on everything so this doesn't help but i think what i think when it happened we all sat here

1208
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:20,660
going it's not going to help you know so right yeah there is that all right um let's move on

1209
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:26,660
and uh get to our last story tonight which is rumor-based but these are rumors that are

1210
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:34,820
gaining a lot of steam so you know take for it what it is they're rumors um but anyway uh so

1211
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:39,780
there's uh this blogger out there zippo that i guess has got some things right before and

1212
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:44,740
it's kind of talking about what nintendo is doing for the rest of the year um and i guess based on

1213
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:48,740
his track record some people are kind of you know running with it a little bit so what is it that

1214
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:51,700
he's talking about for the rest of the year and this isn't the first time i've heard of this

1215
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:56,420
apparently a 2d metroid is something that's being worked on and that apparently it's it's done and

1216
02:02:56,420 --> 02:03:01,300
it's ready to go um so that would be something if we got that really soon you know i love mesa

1217
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:07,460
metroid apparently runs at 60 frames a second but you know as i would encourage everyone else to do

1218
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:11,860
don't set the bar high with this stuff i'm not gonna okay i'd love this but i'm not going to

1219
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:18,500
assume it's happening metroid prime 4 is happening nintendo's confirmed that someday apparently a

1220
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:24,340
donkey kong game from the folks behind mario odyssey is being made it is uh like a 2.5 d type

1221
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:29,620
of game sounds a lot like like the tropical freeze type of thing uh it could be very interesting so

1222
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:35,460
that is something that's being worked on as well as a new fire emblem super mario party 2 more 99

1223
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:42,900
games uh and um apparently and what i think is interesting about this rumor and one reason why

1224
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:48,420
i'm willing to kind of believe it a little more than others is that they go as far to say zelda

1225
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:54,100
2 not this year so i think that's interesting that they're actually kind of placing the bet

1226
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:59,460
there that that isn't happening this year uh and the reason why uh issues uh raised from the

1227
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:05,300
pandemic it's almost complete but the end of the year doesn't seem feasible but it seems plausible

1228
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:09,780
if we want to go back to that word uh that nintendo could announce uh that it would be like

1229
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:15,620
a spring type of game so maybe the same release time frame as say animal crossing since clearly

1230
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:20,260
they can put out a new zelda whenever they want they don't have to do it for the holidays uh they

1231
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:24,980
could do it whenever they want and it'll still sell like crazy and then of course a big one the

1232
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:29,300
new mario kart game there is a new mario kart game that's being worked on as well however it

1233
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:36,180
may not be mario kart 9 um and the the blogger here doesn't know if it's maybe a mario kart 9

1234
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:41,620
or if it's nintendo kart or maybe an expansion for 8 or something so like isn't willing to kind

1235
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:46,740
of place stock in any of those but that there is a new mario kart in development and that that

1236
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:51,540
is coming at some point so you know this is what people are talking about on twitter and things

1237
02:04:51,540 --> 02:05:00,180
like that uh certainly a list like that it's it seems believable enough but again i'm not

1238
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:06,820
going to place bets on anything who who called the game builder garage thing nobody so that came out

1239
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:12,020
of left field so i think there's also a lot of there could be unexpected stuff as well and there

1240
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:17,460
are some things in there that are kind of safe bets again we've heard the 2d metroid thing before

1241
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:22,340
uh to say breath of the wild 2 isn't going to make it because of covid um isn't that big a stretch i

1242
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:28,740
know i said but it's not that big a stretch um a new mario party and a new mario kart of course

1243
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:33,540
you know even though nintendo killed mario some of his franchises are still popular and so they

1244
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:41,300
will weekend at bernie's him through some more games uh to make the money so uh tiger class says

1245
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:46,100
would that world circuit be considered mario kart 9 because there's jokes that's joe 100 matt saying

1246
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:51,700
mario kart 10 they're skipping the nine uh i i mean they could do anything they want you know the

1247
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:56,740
the blogger said what about nintendo kart it doesn't even necessarily need to be a mario kart

1248
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:02,980
what if it's super smash kart i don't know like but i could see that maybe nintendo wants to go

1249
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:08,020
beyond just mario i don't know we'll see we'll see um but i think it will be mario kart 9 or

1250
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:15,940
it'll be i don't want to say a reboot but it'll be like a re like it'll be a mario kart's world

1251
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:21,140
or mario kart's universe or mario kart like they'll give it a new subtitle that kind of takes

1252
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:27,860
it away from the other sequel games we'll see oh and uh the folks are talking about the home circuit

1253
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:31,940
yeah home circuit was like a spin-off it was a different thing that's a good call out because

1254
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:36,580
that was a good example of something different that wasn't in the mainline games no that was not

1255
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:43,540
canonically mario kart 9 um but good call yeah that that was short-lived in my household too

1256
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:52,500
yeah yeah i mean i i'm i'm no more physical things from nintendo anymore i'm not purchasing anything

1257
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,620
that has a physical device because it's just not going to get used ever whether that be labo or

1258
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:03,540
the mario kart thing it's just it's not worth it boy we're making a lot of big statements tonight

1259
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:10,580
all right let's get to our listener round table if you have some comments you'd like us to discuss

1260
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:16,260
in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network we can certainly get into those um and

1261
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:21,060
then of course we want to check our emails you guys email us every week over at participate

1262
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:26,100
at orange longtrady.com and dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and get some emails uh

1263
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:32,420
for us no i'm not oh are there none tonight nothing boo yes we have no bananas and i don't

1264
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:35,860
even think i have really anything on drag race there's literally nothing to discuss i'm not

1265
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:44,020
watching the drag race down under so now what happens oh okay i'm laughing i have no tea to

1266
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:48,820
spill so okay i will get to the discord comments but i have to get to this this is making me laugh

1267
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:56,660
as 100 mad is asking so rob how does it feel to go viral this week i finally after years and years

1268
02:07:56,660 --> 02:08:02,180
on twitter had a tweet that ended up getting like a thousand plus likes on it so i'd say it went

1269
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:07,380
pretty viral even though when i told alan about it he was like well a viral tweet would be like

1270
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:16,740
20 000 likes and it was it wasn't even it's weird that's the interesting thing about what tweets

1271
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:22,980
hit is that i've had some tweets that are pretty fucking funny that don't go anywhere people don't

1272
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:28,100
retweet them i might get 40 or 50 likes from my followers but it doesn't get retweeted or anything

1273
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:31,700
so it doesn't really go and that's fine that's okay but like the tweet i wrote that went viral

1274
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:36,340
so what it was it was a play on this whole there was some dumb magazine or something that had a

1275
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:43,060
feature that was talking about geriatric millennials in the office place that apparently they're now

1276
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:46,100
leading tea i don't even know what the article was about i didn't want to link it because i

1277
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:50,100
didn't want to give it the hits but everybody on twitter of course is dunking on this term

1278
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:56,580
geriatric millennials i think loki would qualify as one with his age yeah but dark soccer and i

1279
02:08:56,580 --> 02:09:01,620
what the fuck does that make us we're technically gen x at that point not even a millennial though

1280
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:09,380
because i'm 1980s so okay so you're like right at the end there so so i i just that would make you

1281
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:14,900
gen y i just i just made this sassy tweet and i found um a picture of a skeleton at a computer

1282
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:21,460
and i put me i put me born in 1978 reading about geriatric millennials that tweet got fucking like

1283
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:27,220
a thousand likes on it and like a hundred retweets so it's it's weird is the answer to that matt i

1284
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:31,620
mean i'm just laughing at it because like it's always the stupid tweets that go viral um the

1285
02:09:31,620 --> 02:09:38,020
closest i ever got before was um like i think i think i got 300 or 400 likes on a tweet that was

1286
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:44,260
using the hashtag um national send a nude day and it was just like a gif of judge judy and i just

1287
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:49,860
put times almost up national send a new and i got like 400 likes it was a gif of judge judy banging

1288
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:56,580
the desk going hurry up like it was stupid like i wish one of my tweets about video games would get

1289
02:09:56,580 --> 02:10:03,220
or a tweet promoting the show but we all the the reality is twitter doesn't do that all right anyway

1290
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:11,300
they haven't found our show by now i i know it's a lost cause at this point um all right so there

1291
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:17,220
there's my answer to your question in chat as to another man all right uh going to discord um i've

1292

1304
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:32,100
doesn't say anything but it's his uh when he renewed his wedding vows at dragon con and he

1305
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:37,060
was dressed us up as shepherd and jenna was dressed up as miranda it's it there's it's really

1306
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:42,020
quick it's like them embracing after saying i do but uh that was the thing so it's it's actually

1307
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:47,300
in the video that's really cool so that's sweet yeah it was i i and uh you know when they uh

1308
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:51,060
when that part came up it was like i know them i know them actually and actually that wasn't

1309
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:56,420
the only person i had a twitter uh mutual that was in the video a little more featured talking about

1310
02:11:56,420 --> 02:12:02,420
um like the gay representation in mass effect and what it meant to him so um there's a lot of

1311
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:08,660
a lot of like wow this is a small world i almost feel guilty for going off earlier but i don't

1312
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:12,740
i mean like you can love a game and still be pissed off that it's not given the love and

1313
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:21,700
affection it deserves we it's that's what it is we protect we we protect our babies uh and that's

1314
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:28,340
that's what it is when it comes to mass effect all right um let's see oh tiger claws link reminds me

1315
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:33,300
of this did you guys see loki you had to have seen this all the hubba balloon around the calculator

1316
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:39,620
game on nintendo switch have you seen this i saw that they had like a calculator app yeah and it

1317
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:45,060
looks exactly like the iphone calculator like right on down to the colors but it's like a

1318
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:50,500
scientific calculator going for 10 bucks but internet gonna internet this is like the whole

1319
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:55,860
like rage like oh man this calculator is the best thing ever it does everything it says it's gonna

1320
02:12:55,860 --> 02:13:03,140
do it's so powerful and it's like i don't know why this is becoming a meme but internet what can you

1321
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:08,340
say they have like like there's like art programs and stuff on there as well like nobody's making a

1322
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:14,180
big deal about that i guess it's just silly that calculator's on there yeah whatever you know um

1323
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:19,860
act deft asking the real questions can that calculator run doom um i don't think so because

1324
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:26,020
it doesn't have that kind of screen on it but but never say never act deft um w04 in chat asks

1325
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:31,620
what are the chances of a new maximum carnage video game now that the new venom movie is coming out

1326
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:38,180
um i mean as good as anything else uh but usually like i feel like they haven't like the marvel

1327
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:43,620
and even dc stuff they haven't really been doing a lot of like this is something the industry used

1328
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:48,180
to do that they don't do as much anymore they haven't done a lot of stuff directly from like

1329
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:54,740
current movies it's like the avengers exists in its own universe in the games now and it's not

1330
02:13:54,740 --> 02:14:00,260
just a port of the movies right some spider-man skins maybe and that's about it yeah that's

1331
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:08,980
probably it but again never say never all right um let's see never ever never ever sj100 matt and

1332
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:13,380
discord with a big headline we didn't get to tonight uh bobby talked about it a little more

1333
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:21,140
on his show but it's the whole hubble about starfield from bethesda is going to be exclusive

1334
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:27,220
to xbox and pc uh originally uh it was thought that this game was going to be exclusive to sony

1335
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:32,660
but is anyone surprised that microsoft bought bethesda and now this game is going to be

1336
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:37,460
exclusive it'll probably be just like a timed exclusive maybe well i don't know if it's gonna

1337
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:43,940
be a complete exclusive i want some of that money it is suggesting that it is a complete exclusive

1338
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:51,700
and it's going to show up at this e3 and it will release in 2022 nice so uh we'll see hope it

1339
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:58,100
doesn't suck i'm more interested in the uh new uh sky or new skyrim new elder scrolls game whenever

1340
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:04,180
that comes out yeah all right um i think uh let me see if i can get through a couple more of these

1341
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:07,620
but first let me go to uh loki and get some last minute stories and then i'll do a couple more

1342
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:13,780
discard discord yeah i don't got any of those what all right um looked there wasn't really anything

1343
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:19,780
worth covering i'm sorry i want to say marcus in our discord uh shared that article about the ps2

1344
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:24,420
exploit that talks about uh certain versions of the system being region free you have to scroll

1345
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:28,260
up a bit because he posted it on may 10th but i know that came up on a previous episode of the

1346
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:36,420
show um so there is that um going back okay well here i got something um so ebay is banning the

1347
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:43,700
sale of adult video games so they're going to be implementing a new adult items policy on june 15th

1348
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:51,460
and they're going to be you know blocking anything that's basically unrated you know triple x x um

1349
02:15:51,460 --> 02:16:00,260
also explicit uh comics books films animation manga hentai yaoi um i don't know if it that

1350
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:06,900
necessarily applies to video games though but maybe if it's unrated so sorry no bmx triple x

1351
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:11,300
uh used or i guess you're not gonna find that anymore you have to go to the facebook marketplace

1352
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:15,540
for that we have to steal it online like a lot of people do these days not that you should do that

1353
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:19,940
now you should do that but sometimes when it comes to games preservation we're left with minimal

1354
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:25,060
choices all right i want to mention this in chat so bobby blackwolf in chat is talking about this

1355
02:16:25,060 --> 02:16:30,660
and dark soccer this is up your alley um literally in a way uh was this was there something earlier

1356
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:35,860
about mandalorian pinball no i didn't bring it up because you did bobby so we we don't always

1357
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:40,580
have to talk about the same things but uh dark soccer of course is a pinball geek so i think

1358
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:45,140
the world wants to know her reactions you're not getting it bobby is so you can fly to atlanta and

1359
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:50,980
play to his house there's already a bunch of people who are like selling their pre-orders

1360
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:55,700
on ebay that well it's probably because there's the whole like three editions right you talked

1361
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:59,140
about a black knight table recently that had this whole thing there's like a limited edition

1362
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:05,140
a extra edition the same thing's going on with the mandalorian yeah well the thing the the big thing

1363
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:12,900
is is that we just got a new to us uh pinball anyway we have uh the jersey jack guns and roses

1364
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:18,980
oh cool yeah it's really cool i actually i actually kind of like it i want to come over

1365
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:24,980
and play pinball come over yay all right let's play come over tomorrow uh maybe

1366
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:31,140
don't you stream on mondays no alan's yes oh i actually stream on mondays earlier

1367
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:39,380
oh well yeah after the show and all that but yeah yeah all right after what show the the one we're

1368
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:44,180
on tomorrow oh tomorrow well i thought i thought i'd do tonight i do monday and i do tuesday

1369
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:50,500
okay all right i'm so confused all right uh at some point it doesn't have to be tomorrow

1370
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:57,060
just whenever uh come over and play pinball um and then in in uh september hopefully uh enough

1371
02:17:57,060 --> 02:18:03,300
people get vaccinated where dragon con can be a thing and uh even if it's a little even if it's

1372
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:07,060
a downscaled show this year which i'm expecting that might be the case they'll probably still

1373
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:11,300
have dragon con but they're probably going to do some things to try to not have people gather

1374
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:16,260
quite in mass as they do but i don't know i at the same time my perception's fucked because i'm

1375
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:19,860
in california not georgia and my understanding is things are very different out there so

1376
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:26,260
it might just be the same old dragon con we'll see but i i know the folks behind it will not have it

1377
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:30,340
if they don't think it's going to be safe i have that trust because i know there's people many

1378
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:35,940
people in atlanta who work at the cdc so uh and uh many folks on dragon con because of that but

1379
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:40,580
anyway assuming i get out there um in september i will look forward to playing bobby's table he'll

1380
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:47,620
have it by then right i think so i think so um which by the way they changed my flight out to

1381
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:52,820
dragon con i had to call delta to try to get an earlier flight i was on hold for 40 minutes and

1382
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:56,100
still didn't get through so i have to try calling again tomorrow because the online wouldn't do it

1383
02:18:56,100 --> 02:19:01,220
for me trying to get on an earlier flight because um it has me getting there at like eight getting

1384
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:06,500
to the airport at like eight o'clock on wednesday eight pm and that's um pretty late in the day so i

1385
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:11,060
want to catch a early morning flight and get there a little sooner if i can because we have a

1386
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:16,100
tradition we always go to that 24 diner around the corner on wednesday night and that was the very

1387
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:20,500
first place i took alan when we went to atlanta was that little diner where he drank way too much

1388
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:26,500
sweet tea and uh we always go there on wednesday nights before the craziness kicks in and if i get

1389
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:33,940
there that late i mean i guess they're 24 hour but still still still still all right um okay

1390
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:38,180

1407
02:20:54,900 --> 02:21:00,260
thought uh my final thought is i'm hoping to have episode well i promised episode two will be out

1408
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:04,660
this week for my youtube series i'm starting it's not really a series yet because there's only one

1409
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:09,940
video but it will be a series eventually um so that'll be out this week episode three will be

1410
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:15,460
much sooner than that because i'm pretty much already filming everything for that so i'll just

1411
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:22,180
turn around that much faster but um yeah look for that all right and dark sakura i'll let you have

1412
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:29,540
your final thought um stay tuned i'm gonna play dead by daylight and try to get a gnome all right

1413
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:35,140
good luck with that yep all right and my final thought um i don't really have a good one there's

1414
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:40,260
there's a lot of exciting and scary stuff going on in my personal life um just send your good vibes

1415
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:44,500
my way um there's a lot a lot going on i will talk about it on the show but it's going to be

1416
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:51,380
a little bit so um yeah um nothing of concern nothing of concern um okay that's it and gaming

1417
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:54,580
is for everyone i think it's a good note to end things on yes it is as well since we always talk

1418
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:58,500
about gaming is more than pixels on a screen i think it's a good reminder gaming is for everyone
