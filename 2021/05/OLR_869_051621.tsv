0	13620	The console arm trace continues to be interesting, since graphics quality can no longer grow
13620	17520	as dramatically as it did generation over generation. Xbox rode the wave of Kinect across
17520	21420	two generations, but as of the series generation they have no extra piece of gaming tech, while
21420	27520	rumors say that Sony's PSVR2 or PS5VR will be impressive, challenging even today's
27520	31800	VR headsets. The story of consoles never ends, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts,
31800	35240	Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about it and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting
35240	37440	right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
37440	45080	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45080	51880	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again tonight
51880	61960	with episode number 869 of our show for this May the 18th, no 16th of 2021 I can't read
61960	67980	my own numbers. Hi I am Rob Roberts and I am joined by my co-hosts say hello as always
67980	75380	to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi how are you? I've had a long day but a fairly
75380	84180	good day. Yeah. I went to one of my favorite places to eat and loaded up on, finally they're
84180	88900	back to having the pink garlic sauce at Pita Kitchen. Nice. Just saying. Oh I don't think
88900	93940	that was there. Sumac is delicious. Yeah, yeah one of our favorite local little restaurants.
93940	97940	We are based in Sacramento, California so sometimes it's, and all three of us live in
97940	103300	the area, we live in the suburbs if nothing else, and so sometimes we can't avoid the
103300	108380	local chat such as favorite restaurants, but if you happen to be local and you know
108380	113700	this place Pita Kitchen, I was just telling Jamie before the show, Alan and I were there
113700	118340	like a week and a half ago and it was it was marvelous and it's a small little restaurant
118340	123060	you know it's like a small team that runs it so I'm really glad they're still around
123060	127860	that's for sure. Absolutely but you know we they had some different stuff there in their
127860	133740	little grocery store and I picked up some spinach and cheese pies they're wrapped in
133740	138060	filo dough they're absolutely they're like giant spanakopita it's really delicious. Get
138060	143620	the baklava because I've had bad baklava but theirs is really good. Theirs is always delightful
143620	148740	and we actually got into a discussion on like how terrible making filo dough is and she's
148740	158980	like we don't make it. Awesome. But yeah we had a really good time but I'm really irritated
158980	163780	that the the pet store that I go to does not have Midniss food nor had they had it for
163780	170260	the last three weeks and I get her refrigerated food so they don't like keep any extra stock
170260	178060	and pack so I had to buy her raw food. I was gonna tell you we can't even like the food
178100	183340	that Smoosh eats we can't even get it at like the big brand we have to go to the indie pet
183340	188340	store over by Lomond's that's the only place that will have the food and that's not the
188340	191180	closest pet store to us but it's whatever it's the only place that has the food that
191180	194100	Smoosh will eat so you should check that but maybe they have the food. What are you feeding
194100	199460	him like caviar from a live sturgeon? No it's just a certain brand he's he's a weird kitty
199460	203900	you all know that he doesn't he doesn't really care for kitty treats either it's it's interesting
203900	209860	so anyway we will get to get look local discussion is inevitable sometimes if you if you are
209860	214460	unaware with the history of our show you know we we are the longest running video game podcast
214460	219460	because we started well video game show because we started this in online show we started
219460	224900	this in 2002 so podcasting wasn't even really a thing yet but we we did get in on podcasting
224900	229380	really early it was before it was on iTunes when you had to use things like lemon pod
229380	233940	I think it was called to a sink your podcast was like 2005 we won the very first podcast
233940	238540	award in gaming we were fortunate for that but anyway we've and I have the award yes
238540	244860	you do there it is uh yeah 2005 uh dark soccer Loki and myself um hi tech master Loki by
244860	253060	the way I hate to make you sit there in silence my bad but we all met playing dance dance
253060	258800	revolution at Roseville golf lands so we there is a local sense of connection here
258800	263420	on the show and you know in those early years if you didn't already know the story at OLR
263420	267780	we talked a lot about DDR that was our scene and that was our community and then Konami
267780	272220	kind of abandoned DDR for a few years and then wanted a seat at the table again once
272220	277020	guitar hero and rock band got big and it was awkward but our show grew into all sorts of
277020	283500	video games because we just love video games dang it right they're like looking at at rock
283500	290300	band going um but what we had this oh you've got better button that's right Konami you
290300	295620	had the opportunity and you didn't take the risk so someone beat you to it you blew it
295620	302660	bitch that's I that's you know they even they even screwed up their own rendition of that
302660	307260	as well considering that they had a winning formula and they're just like now let's put
307260	310860	out rock revolution instead Loki I think your audio is coming through your webcam not your
310860	316580	mic just you know it's it's kind of tin canny okay yeah you might want to check that anyway
316580	321740	but while he fixed that live I'm gonna check our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network
321740	325820	because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern
325820	332260	right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the voice of geeks Network twitch.tv slash vog network I
332380	338700	almost said twitch.tv slash Bobby Black Wolf area for two yes much better for two reasons one I
338700	343940	forgot to say happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf on our throw call tonight that was on my mind his
343940	348980	birthday was this past week so happy belated birthday again I know he's 20 wriggling day go
348980	354860	go figure so for the first time obviously happy happy birthday Bobby Black Wolf and congratulations
354860	360620	to our pal Bobby Black Wolf who announced this week he will be an announcer during summer games
360620	365660	done quick for the it's his third time at a games done quick event pretty much all the virtual ones
365660	370660	at this point so congrats we don't know what games he's announcing yet we're expecting to find that
370660	376700	out tomorrow but as I understand there are no Yakuza runs this year so there's not gonna be
376700	382940	like a baby thing or any of that stuff that yeah I know too bad huh but it's well it's also at the
382940	388140	same time we can say ah but I do love the games done quick like mixes up the games right because
388140	393380	how are other games supposed to get a shot if you know it's always the same games so I think that's
393380	399020	great um let's see some of the comments speaking of the local chat and then I promise we'll get
399020	404820	into gaming news pod culture says how long has it been since Pinkberry was mentioned well that that
404820	410900	is a bit of a local place but I think that I think it's a like a West Coast no it is it's
410900	416860	international I've seen it in it hurts I've seen it in airports pinkberry in Atlanta I think it
416860	421340	started at the airport I yeah I think it started in LA so there's like a lot of them in the West
421340	427420	Coast but anyway long story short the one that are soccer and I used to go to closed and Alan
427420	434140	also my husband kind of let it known that he has a preference for another place called Menchie's
434140	439300	and so that's one of those yogurt battles I just give in on like my husband's allowed a nice thing
439300	445500	once in a while and well they also good they also have dole whip it or Menchie's yes yes what
445500	452460	yeah what yeah they do they do like a dole whip type thing so this has to happen I don't know if
452460	457300	it's official though it but it's their own version of it they I don't think they can call it that but
457300	463060	it's basically that yeah the you know what I still think we need to do is that we need to have a
463060	469460	dinner at Brookfield and then go to pinkberry well you know especially now that I don't want
469460	475940	to say the pandemic is over because it certainly isn't but now that we're getting vaccinated and
475940	480900	you know it make light right now well you know I you still want to be cautious and I know there's
480900	485380	the CDC guidance and a lot of people are a little skittish about that because unfortunately this
485380	491140	panda I mean whereas the science says vaccinated people aren't gonna spread it you can hang out
491140	498260	with other vaccinated people without a mask the reality is a lot of us are a little bit unfortunately
498260	503500	this whole instance has seen the best in people and the worst in people and I don't trust people
503500	508020	to be honest exactly and I don't think a lot of us do we don't trust other people to be honest and
508020	513580	that's really unfortunate but hopefully more and more people get vaccinated and that'll that'll do
513580	519300	the trick because the vaccinations are working that's it period so the more people to get
519300	523140	vaccinated the less longer this is gone but anyway it's nice to think that some of those
523140	528260	things are a possibility again like the you know Brookfield's trip and you know who may be going
528260	533260	to see what a sad place Rosewood Golf Land is these days and what have you all those types of
533260	539500	things so yeah who knows a lot of exciting stuff coming in the next few months I'm sure I think
539500	544580	it would be fun to film a trip like that and put it as like a bonus video at vog network for our
544580	551020	subscribers that might be fun so you know what though I legit haven't been to Pinkberry since
551020	556660	2019 I haven't been in about a year myself I still like it like just because I give in and
556660	561660	my husband gets to pick most of the time I still I still I still sneak and have it I'll be at an
561660	565860	airport and I'll be like oh I'm gonna have that so didn't need blood orange back and then I'll go
565860	571860	huh speaking of air pop go ahead I was gonna say I stopped going there because I just didn't like
571860	577700	their flavors like I had one like they started doing these like kind of they were sort of ice
577700	583380	cream but not ice cream and they just started like really weird flavors I didn't like so that's what
583380	587660	pissed Alan off to their their flavor selection was so limited and once they would get a flavor
587660	591620	that he really liked it would be gone at the end of the month they rotate something else yeah do
591620	598500	do you know though what I what I miss hmm is I miss Naya the gelato place that was all in the
598580	603740	area oh I don't I don't think I ever ate there maybe once so so alright and I'll get off of it
603740	608660	after this but just imagine you have a place that has something like 20 different flavors of gelato
608660	614100	and they rotate a lot of their flavors and they had champagne they had Guinness they had whole
614100	621260	wheat that tasted like eating cereal they had like all kinds of just different ones and the
621260	629900	alcoholic ones were actually alcoholic and I ate a big ol bowl of Guinness and champagne it was
629900	637020	delightful no I miss is we had a place over here and I think it's a chain Rita's that's frozen
637020	643820	custard yes the one that's nearby all right all right look super disappointed that's so so good
643820	649500	look can you tell me when ice cream I get that snacking is important and if if the chat wasn't
649620	654940	lighting up going mmm gelato yes Rita's like if the chat wasn't supporting this we probably would
654940	658940	have cut it off a while ago but I do want to get into some gaming news because there was quite a
658940	664300	bit of it this week I'm gonna say okay I won't even talk then about the whole week kit kats oh
664300	670220	we could do a whole other spin-off show on Kit Kat flavors and we might but anyhow and my new
670220	678460	obsession is Pringles from around the world all right let's talk tonight our kickoff story tonight
678460	683900	we want to talk a little bit about Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest and you may be thinking like Rob are
683900	687420	you giving preference to one of your favorite games and letting it have the lead topic tonight
687420	694180	partially yes but even if you don't play Final Fantasy 14 please don't tune out completely I
694180	698260	assure you there's a very good reason I'm bringing this up at the top of the show talking about Fan
698260	704260	Fest I'll get to there in a minute so obviously the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest convention is
704340	710460	virtual this year every other year they've done three of them in person they do a Vegas one they
710460	716340	do a Europe one they do a Japan one and it's usually like doing a tour of the latest expansion
716340	720140	announcement obviously because of COVID it was supposed to be in San Diego this year actually
720140	724580	they're gonna move it from Vegas but you know long story short we all know what COVID did to that so
724580	730100	they ended up doing these online events instead so they did that they did a original like keynote
730100	735580	announcement back in February Shane and I co-stream that with some of our buddies that we
735580	739980	play Final Fantasy with here at VOG Network and Shane and I did that last season not last night
739980	746900	Friday night as well is we actually were streaming the keynote event that showed everything else
746900	751180	about this expansion coming up and that was here at VOG Network so for those of you that subscribe
751180	757380	to us here at Twitch on here at VOG Network on Twitch first off thank you second off you can go
757380	765100	back and watch that if you want it is a longer keynote because the translation because they have
765100	770820	to say it in Japanese then they say it in English so you know an hour keynote now is two hours and
770820	774860	even within they were kind of having they were kind of stretching time like you could tell the
774860	779180	parts that you know the audience response would be yeah woo and like screaming and they that was
779180	784540	gone and so it would be these interesting moments of Naoki Yoshida the producer kind of leaning in
784580	790700	and looking at the TV monitors like literally reading chat as he's trying to do the whole
790700	796660	thing you know and and so for what for what it is with the state of the world being that it is
796660	802900	he did his best and I thought it was a he tried and it was it was a good keynote overall and a
802900	808420	lot of the expansion announcements about the game look great as we learned previously Final Fantasy
808420	813780	14 is going to be the latest expansion called Endwalker it seems to have a heavy Final Fantasy
813780	819620	4 influence because we're going to the moon and they are now selling a lunar whale mount in the
819620	828180	game as well as you can get Rosa Edgar and one other one I'm sorry not Edgar edge Rosa edge already
828180	833740	of course you can get I'm in the shop little minions are right now for in the game and there's
833740	839500	pre-order bonuses I think porum is the pre-order bonus and then Palom is in the collectors box I
839580	844900	might have gotten that backwards you know those those of you that really need to know that
844900	850340	information probably already know they gave us the release date though November 23rd that's a
850340	854660	little ways out I think some folks were a little bit like oh that's a bummer we're gonna have to
854660	860420	wait so long but I mean you know the the development of the game was really kind of stopped for four
860420	865620	months during kovat so if you think about it it does make sense so when he as awesome as this
865620	872220	expansion looks it you understand you want it to be done right of course right we hate it when God
872220	876420	they're trying to do it yeah we hate it when game companies release games and there's problems with
876420	885220	them hold that hold that thought it'll be relevant later anyhow oh and I'm gonna have an F you for
885220	890540	the record we'll get there meanwhile let's talk about some other information with obviously 14
890540	896260	and Walker they revealed the other class that will be playable in the game it's it's one of
896260	901260	the things that pains me the most in the world is having to admit when Shane was Shane is right but
901260	905820	damn that boy nailed it like he called that the new class would be the reaper class and it would
905820	910260	have a scythe and sure enough it was the reaper class with a scythe I think the thing he didn't
910260	914300	figure out might be enough to make me play again the thing he didn't figure out was that you get a
914300	919620	little ghost companion when you play it and you kind of like absorb the ghost hugs you it's the
919620	924180	most adorable thing I've ever seen and go look up the reaper trailer dark Sakura on the fantasy
924180	928540	14 channel it's pretty amazing the problem is is that I would have to buy the whole thing on Mac
928540	937580	again yeah that part's a bummer yeah cuz the yeah yeah so but anyway so you you kind of can merge
937580	942740	with the ghost and you do special attacks and that's cool they also unveiled and this was big
942740	947700	for me at the end I was not expecting it and if you go back and watch the feed I was literally
947780	952060	just in a state of shock because I my brain literally did not understand what was happening
952060	959340	when they announced male Viera are coming to the game as the next playable race by God male Viera
959340	966240	the bunny people from Final Fantasy 12 that have always been like Fran was the biggest most well
966240	973380	known Viera and the lore you only ever really saw female Viera I believe male Viera kind of known to
973380	978340	exist but they're not really seen but anyway long story short we're getting them in Final Fantasy 14
978340	983060	I've been a big advocate for this for a long time so I was thrilled and now that I've had time for
983060	987100	like my brain to process at all I am really thrilled with this and absolutely I'll be race
987100	992860	changing to a boy bunny as will lots of people that play Final Fantasy 14 I'm sure so that is
992860	997580	a very exciting announcement and then of course they detailed some new areas in the game and soon
997580	1001860	some new things about the story they really detailed the collector's edition they wheeled
1001940	1007060	it out they have a pin and they have all this other really cool stuff that is coming out so
1007060	1013380	for the most part that was the keynote now the event continued on throughout the weekend and
1013380	1018900	they would do some panels talking about like they had one the live letter that kind of gave
1018900	1025380	a roadmap about what to expect between now and when the end Walker expansion releases like here's
1025380	1031100	the next story patch here's when we're gonna implement the data center moving which is another
1031100	1036180	huge thing about and Walker I'm so excited for that for example like Ziba here at vog network I
1036180	1040540	don't know she's listening live tonight but I know she listens to the show and she's always kind of
1040540	1045460	said a bummer you know she's on a different data center than I am we can't play together but in
1045460	1050340	Endwalker or shortly before Endwalker starts we will be able to do that with the data center move
1050340	1056060	so a temporary move I visit whatever they call it so that is gonna be very exciting and they also
1056060	1061420	do these big concerts this is the big big you know thing when you're there live the concert is
1061420	1066740	it man they did like a Friday night piano concert and they do a Saturday night concert with the
1066740	1074060	primals which is like a rock band that features Soken he's the guy that does all the music for
1074060	1079180	Final Fantasy 14 he actually like plays guitar and sings a lot of songs and all his band kind of
1079180	1083820	does that it's really cool unfortunately because the time difference they were doing this in Japan
1083820	1090740	it was on at like 3 in the morning for us here in the US so I didn't watch it live here's the part
1090740	1097260	okay perk up because here's the part that is a really big deal and had a lot of people in the
1097260	1104340	community talking today so they did the concert and after the concert is the closing ceremony but
1104340	1109860	it was a little bit different what happened is Soken wanted to talk to the crowd that was watching
1110060	1114340	for a little bit and he basically said you know thank you for your support thank you for everything
1114340	1118460	you've done this has really helped me get through the year and I'm very sorry I don't have the
1118460	1124100	official audio I tried to get that working before the show unfortunately it didn't work I tweeted
1124100	1130260	out that video earlier today if one of our resourceful folks like Tiger Claw or dark Tetsuya
1130260	1134780	could like pull that video from my tweet from this morning and like post it in chat and maybe the
1134780	1138780	discord I'd really appreciate it cuz and so that those of you listening on the podcast feed can go
1138780	1144860	check out on discord this video link um Soken was thanking everybody because he revealed that in
1144860	1153140	March of 2020 right before the coronavirus pandemic set in he was diagnosed with cancer and he didn't
1153140	1157700	reveal what type of cancer it was so we don't know those details but what we do know is that
1157700	1165700	Square Enix and the Final Fantasy 14 team basically allowed him to work while he was in the hospital
1165700	1174300	and if you've played things like patch 5.3 there's a really big boss fight in that game with a really
1174300	1179540	epic song in it called to the edge I believe is the name of that song that song was basically
1179540	1185860	written while he was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and that song if you
1185860	1193940	listen to it has a huge impact like that like go back and listen to that song again now that you
1193940	1202500	know that information that is huge Soken's contribution I'm sorry I'm just this is a very
1202500	1207300	heavy topic we're getting into and I'm just like I actually got choked up watching the video today
1207300	1215020	and I get choked up thinking about it because you cannot understate the contributions of Soken to
1215020	1222100	Final Fantasy 14 I have said this on the show before there can be no successor to Nobuo Uematsu
1222100	1226860	what that man has done for Final Fantasy what that man has done for video game composition and
1226860	1235140	all of that can can never be replaced however what Soken has done with Final Fantasy 14 and
1235140	1241500	when you really consider that the project was a realm reborn and all of this the contributions
1241500	1249580	of Soken he's a worthy successor to Final Fantasy's music and I would assume I don't know I would have
1249580	1254300	assumed before I heard this news over the weekend that he was probably doing Final Fantasy 16's
1254300	1260020	music as well this situation I'm not sure if that's the case anymore who knows or any of that
1260020	1269220	um he didn't tell they did not tell the production team about his cancer because everybody was
1269220	1274300	working from home so people didn't know so this was the first time a lot of the production team
1274300	1278780	was finding out about this and so it was it was really heavy because you could hear the story
1278780	1284940	producer going like I I feel so guilty I was giving you so much work and asking all of these
1284940	1289780	changes for you when I was going through all this and Soken is basically saying and I am paraphrasing
1289780	1297660	here like I I am having this to work on having the fans feedback from things like the to the
1297660	1303500	edge composition having all of this kept me going and that's the part that really gets you choked
1303620	1311140	up and then something else to consider is that Naoki Ishida who's the producer of the game and
1311140	1315900	you know a big figure he's the face of the game he's you know the guy that gets out there and does
1315900	1321740	all these keynotes this entire time that Soken is talking he has his back to the audience and you
1321740	1329540	can tell he's he's he's breaking up he's tearing up and after about 13 minutes of discussion with
1329540	1335700	Soken and the team and everything he says I know this is a strange note to end the closing
1335700	1344700	ceremonies on but I just want to say that I am so happy that my best friend is still here and if you
1344700	1348900	don't get a little choked up in that moment watching it and again I'm sorry I can't be here
1348900	1354900	and play it for you guys but it might be triggering to some folks I don't know so if you go and watch
1354900	1362220	it if you don't get a little choked up hearing that I don't know you've had a different life
1362220	1366300	experience than I clearly because I had a hard time holding it together this morning watching
1366300	1373620	that you know when you consider what that this game what this community what this has done for
1373620	1379020	people and and Yoshida also explains this a little bit with that when he was giving his first speech
1379020	1385940	to the team when he was rebooting Final Fantasy 14 Soken was one of the first people to jump up
1385940	1391100	and advocate for him and say let's do this let's go and so you can tell there's a tight friendship
1391100	1398700	between these two and Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy the franchise is better for it so to hear
1398700	1406740	that all of this happened and none of us had any idea and the game sure it had a four-month delay
1406740	1412820	but are any of us gonna complain at this point no we are not because of everything we've heard
1412820	1419820	that this team is going through and what they're going through personally it's like wow now why is
1419820	1425740	this relevant to folks who maybe don't play Final Fantasy 14 I mean yes it's a nice story but I tell
1425740	1432220	you all this and I tell you about what you know Soken is literally pouring his heart and soul into
1432220	1440020	this game and using this as therapy to get you know to fight what is a horrific battle tell me
1440020	1450460	video games aren't art people I mean people that have said in the past video games aren't art or
1450460	1457060	people that mouth we had a story a couple weeks ago about somebody getting mouthy on their cable
1457060	1463780	talk show about oh twitch is just people watching plate people play video games not stupid I dare
1463780	1468860	that individual to watch that 13-minute video I watched earlier today fucking look them in the
1468860	1473580	face and say video games aren't art or the video game community isn't important or video games
1473580	1485020	don't fucking help people that fucking stereotype is done we've had it I don't know what else to say
1485020	1490460	that's that and that's why I wanted to bring it up is that like if if you can't listen to this
1490460	1496700	story and understand that video games are more than video games for a lot of people then you're
1496700	1506460	never gonna get it period so um Bobby Black Wolf in chat said Shane complained complained initially
1506460	1512020	but that was in the keynote I not to speak for him but a he's the one that texted me this morning
1512020	1517340	about all of that that went on and I bet if I asked him again he'd be like oh I get it and he
1517340	1522540	did kind of like during the keynote he was kind of like oh well you know yeah it's kind of the same
1522540	1527620	thing I landed I he's he's he's only bummed because it looks so good he wants to play it now but he
1527620	1531500	gets it I'm sure again I don't want to speak for him but I'm pretty sure he would say something to
1531500	1537220	the equivalent there fifth dream in chat says yeah Jesus that guy talking about soaking I have
1537220	1543180	literally hundreds a thousand songs by him on my PC I have all those Final Fantasy 14 blu-ray
1543180	1548340	soundtracks do yourself a favor folks even if you don't fucking care about MMOs and I get it like
1548340	1554700	it's monthly fees they're they're tough sometimes even though did you know Final Fantasy 14 is free
1554700	1558860	to play including the award-winning expansion heavens work this is like a meme at this point
1558860	1564900	but I'm serious you could check it out the first part for free but you go listen to the soundtracks
1564900	1570420	at least they're so good and there's so many like ways that they've remixed different songs in the
1570420	1577180	game and so forth it's it's pretty amazing let's see and sacred J points out it was it was
1577180	1584180	triggering I had tears yeah I mean it's it's it's very difficult to watch and yeah but I think it
1584180	1589940	just goes to show that like you know again video games are much bigger than pixels on a screen
1589940	1594500	that's for sure and especially when you look at a game like Final Fantasy 14 that has such a huge
1594500	1603060	community as it does it was it was a difficult but also a very beautiful thing to watch so it
1603060	1609380	just it just makes my heart for that game grow 10 more sizes honestly it really does but if you
1609380	1613940	if you don't play it and you're not into it that's okay too I'm sure you still agree with my bottom
1613940	1620900	line and recognize that there's a lot more to this game than a game that's for sure you know I still
1620900	1625300	listen to the old da theme when I want to chill yeah yeah there's some there's some there's some
1625300	1630900	great songs for lots of moods in that game at depth says there's some Final Fantasy 14 A Realm
1630900	1635940	Reborn tracks in theater them that are pretty good yes especially the arcade version has a lot of 14
1635940	1640980	tracks in them if you're ever lucky enough to play one of those that's for sure so all right so that's
1640980	1646580	why I wanted to talk about the beginning of the show video games more than just pixels all right
1647460	1655220	and kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team for being vulnerable for one and just a well-done fan fest
1655220	1660500	even if even if I was a little critical that it was moving a little bit slow I give them a break
1660500	1666420	because they were expecting it to be in front of a crowd and it wasn't it's gonna be awkward it's
1666420	1673460	okay I'm excited to play the expansion very very very much and listening to all of the music that
1673460	1679060	Soken makes for that expansion and he's they I believe they said chat please correct me if
1679060	1687220	I'm wrong I believe he did say it is in remission um so um I I so uh yeah that's that does does
1687220	1693540	have a happy note there okay um moving on let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the
1693540	1697620	types of video games and and maybe some gaming things off the screen too that we've been into
1697620	1703700	this week uh Dark Soccer I'll start with you well I'm starting off with anger but I'll get to the
1703700	1709940	anger in a little bit so um of course I've been playing some Animal Crossing and uh my friend
1709940	1717940	Mika who has been in chat before is also playing so I gave her about 30 to 40 DIYs of which six
1717940	1725220	remained since you just started playing um thank you for helping to clear out my recycle bin um
1725460	1730980	I also am doing and I don't know if a lot of people know about this but on the Nintendo online
1730980	1739060	app for your smartphone um if you go into that and then open up nook link you can redeem or you
1739060	1747540	can like earn points and they have six was six yeah six items that you can redeem at different
1747780	1755780	uh at different price points but uh there's like switch cases and a a door placard that looks like
1755780	1762340	the leaf but um three of the items are photographs and one of them is Isabel one is nook and the
1762340	1775780	other are the nooklings they they really boost your uh uh AHH or AHA whatever HHA score the
1775780	1781940	happy home academy yes happy home academy um and then of course I've been playing Dead by Daylight
1781940	1787620	because I haven't gotten the freaking gnome yet and I played a lot but I had a funny experience
1787620	1792660	and I do have to talk about this because it was hilarious so um I was in Hawkins which used to be
1792660	1798100	one of my least favorite maps and I guess the guys I was playing I guess realized I was you know
1798100	1804420	fairly new you know I was doing okay but I think that they were giving me looping practice because
1804420	1810580	they would wait for me and then point and then they would run the loop and I just follow along
1810580	1817380	and then they let me 4k nice how random is that though like that never happens usually people are
1817380	1822500	assholes it's it's interesting the way that people and this is in general for all games we're talking
1822500	1827940	about just dead by daylight in this instance but isn't it interesting how people can communicate
1827940	1832980	without communicating uh because I had a very similar sort of thing except I was the survivor
1833300	1838260	and for the record they were all console so I couldn't chat them oh bummer um I had a very
1838260	1843220	similar circumstance where I was the survivor and there was a nurse in the match and I was like
1843220	1848180	I was being chased by the nurse and the nurse wasn't using blink and I was kind of like this
1848180	1853860	isn't normal like what's going on I thought it must be a baby nurse oh my gosh so I would just
1853860	1857780	I did things like I just started booping the nurse like I would turn around and look at the nurse and
1857780	1863140	I booped the nurse into which response she'd hit me once but she would she didn't hit me twice
1863860	1870660	yeah so I so that was the communication to me oh she's here to farm so finally and without
1870660	1875460	communicating because again I was with randos we figured out this nurse wants to farm and so we
1875460	1880180	were doing healings we're letting the nurse hit us and all this stuff and then we left the match
1880180	1885780	pretty much helping each other out and left well uh dark soccer we were all on steam so we could
1885780	1894980	chat and the killer was like gg I have a daily to chase for 180 seconds as nurse yeah what the
1894980	1900420	fuck quest is that thanks for letting me get it and I was the one that ran him because I was like
1900420	1904260	why is this nurse chasing me and not using blink and I'm thinking in my head oh well I'm just gonna
1904260	1908980	keep running and like practicing doing that little did I know I helped him beat his quest and I had
1908980	1916900	that as a generic yeah so it's um so I had to do that on plague yeah yeah so it was just uh
1916900	1920900	interesting so communicating without communicating anyway sorry sorry to derail your daily week but
1920900	1925700	I really like that although there are times where if I do get somebody in chat I'm just gonna flat
1925700	1931300	out say you know if they're being little troll assholes I'll be like real mature and then I'll
1931300	1937620	just leave because don't care um usually I'm playing the plague so I can blood vomit on them
1937620	1942500	so that it forces them to leave the match anyway um so this is the thing I'm pissed about
1943700	1952820	so I did all of my reading up on the windows arm environment I am on a mac mini m1 I need it for
1952820	1958820	the majority of the work that I'm going to do I can game on it just fine except that you know
1958820	1966900	I installed parallels I got the windows arm beta up the developer's beta so I could have the
1966900	1976020	increased uh emulation and it won't run mass effect and I have paid for mass effect so I have
1976020	1985300	a uh a kvm switch arriving tomorrow and um I'm going to hook up uh my my pc again the old dinosaur
1986020	1996260	so that I can steam link on my mac okay yeah um and I think it's gonna be okay
1996260	2005700	it's just I then have to figure out another cord or cable to get I'm just I'm not happy about it
2006420	2015220	and I know that they are still working on the x86 emulation um for windows arm and I'm pretty
2015220	2022020	positive that you know it's not going to be too long away and I'm not the most super hurried about
2022020	2029860	it I guess because I have played them ad nauseum at the same time I need my space bird husband
2031940	2040500	I need I need the voice of garris to just read the phone book to me yeah the struggle read the
2040500	2045620	presidium directory thank you garris well I hope you're able to um get that figured out or the you
2045620	2049540	know the emulation kind of pulls through I mean I get it's a newer game and it's really pushing the
2049540	2053460	boundaries of graphics and stuff so there's a part of me that kind of gets it but I also
2053460	2057380	understand how it's frustrating but it is isn't it nice that we have you know now that cloud and
2057380	2062180	streaming technology again jamie you've given more cases for why that stuff is a good thing
2062180	2066420	here on the show than any of us like you know you play dead by daylight on stadia you do you know
2066420	2071940	and uh it's it's interesting to hear how you're using this cloud technology to your benefit in
2071940	2077300	these different ways well and I'm really I'm really happy about it I mean right now the only
2077300	2086100	thing that I I would need uh my pc for is just for for mass effect and if I wanted to play dead
2086100	2093300	by daylight on on steam I'm going to log into dead by daylight on my pc just long enough to link my
2093300	2101540	steam account to it yeah so that my purchases will transfer yeah smart um but I mean I I'm still
2101540	2106740	considering keeping parallels uh and keeping her to run the windows arm because I can now play hot
2106740	2113860	a full boyfriend again um but a lot of the other games that I'm playing are available on mac like
2113860	2123780	uh I still have to play uh uh the second edition of uh homestuck hive bent um you know which uh
2123780	2129060	I've just been putting that off and I'm probably gonna stream that too but other than that I'm
2129060	2136500	also playing fantasion which uh I'm moving into I've moved it to Tuesdays to do my weekly you know
2136500	2146420	chapter so my goal is to get through like a story segment every time I play nice and so I'm really
2146420	2152340	pleased with that and then I've also just discovered a lot of other streamers um and uh I'm really
2152340	2157700	really happy about that and uh pod culture asked me if g-force now would work for me um probably
2157700	2165860	because that's how um amethyst rose witch plays but it doesn't have mass effect don't so again
2166500	2172980	because it's because it's steam linked through origin yeah and so that's where the
2172980	2176820	ea probably wants to do their own thing eventually whenever they get around to it so
2176820	2182820	right right um I mean if ea puts out a streaming service then heck yeah I'll be able to you know
2182820	2188980	the the thing is that it's still probably need to play some sort of uh copy on my computer so
2188980	2194020	that I can mod the shit out of it later well maybe maybe as some xcloud and microsoft's technology
2194020	2198020	moves along that might actually be a good thing for ea because we know that ea play
2198020	2202740	and xbox game pass have an agreement together so that could that could mean something I it's
2202740	2207540	I'm hypothesizing but maybe when microsoft's cloud technology launches publicly that's going to be a
2207540	2214180	good thing well and you know what I've saved I have saved all of my character save files from
2214180	2219220	the earlier mass effects they work but not well not one they did change the save file format for
2219220	2223780	one but two and three will work that's what I heard yeah but what this means is that when I
2223780	2229620	start making a save file for one I can use the gibbed editor and change the way my shepherd looks
2229620	2235540	nice so well you know that's always kind of fun for me you're gonna the the thing you need in
2235540	2239780	mass effect legendary dish or you you've won it the photo mode that's all you need there's a photo
2239780	2245300	mode now you're gonna have a field day oh well you realize I was doing that anyway with fly cam oh
2245300	2248260	no I know I know that's why I'm like you're gonna have a field day because now it's built in
2248900	2253940	and everyone when I'm playing again look forward to the return of mass effecting
2253940	2261940	it will happen I might do it on tumblr I might do it on twitter it it it remains to be seen but
2262820	2267140	I've had people poking me already because I mean I got like over 10,000 followers on
2267700	2273060	tumblr for mass effecting nice so we'll see all right I didn't mean to go off about that and I
2273060	2278420	will never do tick tock just saying all right uh let's move on to loki loki we barely heard from
2278420	2285460	you tonight how was your gaming week it's been all minecraft surprise no um so I've been just
2285460	2292580	more progress on the server that I'm on um dill haven't put out the second episode yet but I've
2292580	2296740	got a lot of footage I have to go through my my problem is I'm stuck in this kind of bad habit
2296740	2302660	where I keep doing stuff in the game and keep recording it but not editing that all down so
2302980	2306900	I need to find a good stopping point and then right now kind of the stuff I'm doing has more
2306900	2313220	of an episode three type stuff but it's been lots of building farms and debugging stuff I've built
2313220	2318980	a piglin bartering farm but the problem with is the normal design where you can separate them by
2318980	2326820	one block because the server I'm on they have a dropped item entity reduction thing to help with
2326820	2331620	lag and so what happens is when you drop stuff too close together it kind of clumps together
2332180	2339940	and so that broke what I have with my farm so I had to um I have eight piglins right now to trade
2339940	2345860	with but I had to drop that down the four so every other one um in order to space them out enough and
2345860	2349620	I have to figure out I'm going to do the other four probably move them around or something
2349620	2354580	but that's what I've been working on it's a lot of work it's all of this like farm stuff just to
2355220	2360820	get the supplies I need to actually do more of the creative stuff um and then there's also the
2360820	2365700	way I plan for episode three is building like an actual shop in the shopping district so I've been
2365700	2372020	working on getting it all together I have a design done for it um just supply gathering right now so
2372020	2377620	that's what I'm doing with the the farms I have um and then outside of that a little bit of orna
2377620	2384740	um that's pretty much been it it's it's the same old stuff um sacred jade in chat is asking what
2384740	2389300	game is playing behind you tonight live on twitch you've got an interesting looking 16-bit game is
2389940	2397860	that is it is ghoul patrol that is the sequel to uh zombies ate my neighbors that I don't think
2397860	2402420	ever came out over here um but that's also something that we're I think it's one of the
2402420	2406740	stories we're talking relevant it is it's relevant to pay attention all right I have never played
2406740	2413940	this one but yeah it's uh I like the first one all right we'll talk more about that later meanwhile
2413940	2419940	my gaming week um so I've been continuing in dragon quest builders 2 um you I'm still in the
2419940	2424740	first area like my gosh there's there's a lot to this game I don't know if I'm gonna get through it
2424740	2428740	um I I really don't know if I'm gonna get through it with other stuff that's released now but I I've
2428740	2433860	been continuing on in that uh playing a little more final fantasy 14 uh thanks to fan fest and
2433860	2437780	there's a special moogle tome event going on in the game right now so I'm really motivated to
2437780	2442020	get back in there and do my roulettes and stuff again so um there's that and then I'm still
2442020	2446580	playing dead by daylight myself as well working on killer and survivor unfortunately I got to
2446580	2451140	this point where like I've gotten my killer up to you know like rank 12 or 11 which you'd think
2451140	2456260	would be a good thing but it actually is really annoying because I there's a lot of killers I'm
2456260	2461460	still working on I have no talents with and uh when I get matched up with players survive I get
2461460	2466580	survivor squads that just bully me and I can't do anything because I don't have the talents to
2466580	2470420	really go up against them the matchmaking in the game is really screwed up right now and I really
2470420	2474660	wish they'd work on that and then this whole thing with the rank reset went totally I didn't
2474660	2480900	even get rank reset so that and some people got like people at high ranks got reset all the way
2480900	2485460	down to like the lowest ranks and like that I don't know why that stuff was happening but yeah
2485460	2490740	behavior I really they need to work on that bugs aside I'm still at least having fun with the game
2490740	2496740	at least I don't give a shit about my rank I really don't and at least the blood points and
2496740	2501860	development of your character always goes forward never backwards so there's that so even if I lose
2501860	2506580	a game horrifically I still get some blood points and I can develop my character and that's what I
2506580	2512660	really want so there's that um and so those are all uh the the ones you'd expect me to talk about
2512660	2516740	that I've talked about a lot of weeks and then of course there's the big one so like dark soccer
2516740	2522500	talked about um I am a huge fan of mass effect and I've talked about that ad nauseum on this program
2522500	2527540	so it is no surprise whatsoever um that I picked up mass effect legendary edition as well this week
2527540	2533780	and I've picked it up uh yes and I I decided to pick it up on xbox one or xbox series x as the
2533780	2541140	case may be um uh that's where I first played the trilogy uh was on xbox 360 and I was like you
2541140	2546580	know I want to have a nice little plop on the couch and play through game I I want to I want
2546580	2551540	to play through the game this way and so that's what I did um I bought the physical version
2551540	2557780	because I heard that the digital version was like 120 gigabytes and I'm thinking in the back of my
2557780	2562420	mind I don't have the bandwidth for that right now like we we went over our bandwidth cap last week I
2562420	2566660	can't and Alan's gonna play this too and I'm pretty sure he did do the digital so we really
2566660	2571780	don't have the bandwidth for this right now so I'm like I'll get the physical and uh that'll work um
2572980	2579700	I gotta say I love the mass effect trilogy it's one of my favorite trilogies or honestly favorite
2579700	2584420	game series that's ever happened um having played the game a little bit I love what they've done to
2584420	2590100	the original mass effect it looks a lot better um the Mako stuff doesn't annoy the shit out of
2590100	2596260	you it's it's usable um there's a there's a lot of fun that being said if you haven't picked up
2596260	2603380	the mass effect legendary edition I don't know if you should get it right now uh and that might
2603380	2611700	surprise you but unfortunately there are some problems and unfortunately this is a fucking
2611700	2618580	trend with BioWare games lately and EA games lately and unfortunately I've hit my breaking
2618580	2625060	point with this shit and that is there's there's too many bugs I don't know if the game should have
2625060	2629300	been released I don't think it was necessarily 100% ready and I'm going to talk about the
2629300	2634100	biggest bug that's annoying the shit out of me it crashed my xbox which you know whatever of
2634100	2638900	course that's going to go right after an important part of the game it crashed thankfully it auto
2638900	2643460	saves a lot I didn't lose too much progress but that was annoying and dark soccer will talk about
2643460	2647700	some of the other reports coming in about bugs and things like that later on in the show but
2647700	2650740	I'm going to tell you the thing that's pissed me off more than anything and it might seem like a
2650740	2657540	little thing but I and I don't know if this is just me being 40 so I'm going full Karen in this
2657540	2664980	moment or whatever it is but I I fucking had it with this and this is the companies and the the
2664980	2671940	internet companies and the gaming companies not figuring shit out when it comes to bandwidth caps
2671940	2678500	and us losing as a result of that and I'm gonna this is exactly what it is so the xbox version
2678500	2684580	of the game comes with two discs one is labeled disc one that says uh play disc the other one's
2684580	2689780	labeled disc two which is installation disc I want to stress the xbox disc and the playstation
2689780	2695780	discs are not labeled the same okay so when you go to xbox here's what I did I put in disc one
2695780	2700500	of course because why wouldn't I I put in disc one to fire up the game okay I'm gonna install mass
2700500	2708100	effect one and uh then uh it installed mass effect one and it downloaded an 11 gig update
2708980	2714820	uh fine all right games need updates whatever 11 gigs worth I don't know okay I thought I thought
2714820	2720500	a patch actually just patched files like actually just substituted the parts 11 but I don't know
2720500	2725940	enough about programming I guess I shouldn't talk so 11 gigs then I'm like you know what while I'm
2725940	2730340	here since I've installed the first game why don't I just install the other two games because I'm
2730340	2735380	gonna play them eventually so I go to mass effect 2 I hit install and it props up on the screen and
2735460	2741140	says we're gonna download 36 gigs press ok to continue whoa whoa wait what what
2741140	2748100	you're gonna download 36 gigs for mass effect 2 what is this other what is this other disc
2748100	2752900	okay maybe it's mass effect 3 let's go to mass effect 3 I'm gonna download 38 gigs what what
2754340	2761300	what's this other disc sake okay let me um all right maybe I was maybe I need to oh I'll launch
2761300	2767780	the game from the second disc that'll that'll fix it so I put in the second sorry you need the
2767780	2774260	first disc to start this game okay all right so I put in the first disc maybe I need a disc swap I
2774260	2780820	eject the first disc I'm kicked out to the xbox menu long story short that second disc doesn't do
2780820	2790260	a goddamn thing what is it well from sleuthing around online what I have learned is if you keep
2790260	2797780	yourself offline when you initially install the game you will use that data disc as your second
2797780	2804820	and third install for mass effect 2 and 3 and then you can patch them but if that's stupid if
2804820	2810340	you're at the point where I'm at where you've already installed the first game and so I thought
2810340	2815780	oh okay I'll put myself in I shouldn't have to do this but I'll put myself in offline mode trick it
2815780	2820180	into thinking I don't have the internet then I can install from the disc and guess what nope the game
2820180	2826100	crashes because it can't figure out that it can't download the game because that initial patch I
2826100	2834420	downloaded apparently patched out the ability to install from the discs unacceptable and I'm sorry
2834420	2842900	if I've blown your ears out but I am so fucking mad this is so ridiculous that this is happening
2842900	2849620	like is it really that hard and I admit I don't know shit when it comes to programming games is
2849620	2855940	it really that hard to just have an option when you hit install that says download install from
2855940	2862500	disk it doesn't Loki you've made a game does that sound difficult what I'm asking for no and also I
2862500	2867300	don't understand why you wouldn't just install from the disc and not I get it downloading a
2867300	2871460	patch but like you would think that you would try to conserve I mean if you cared about your
2871460	2875140	customers you try to conserve their bandwidth as much as possible especially when we're talking
2875300	2879780	large downloads thank you this is and you know what I know there's going to be some people out
2879780	2884180	there that's like Rob is throwing a fit over something ridiculous and I warned you in the
2884180	2891620	beginning I admit this is like a little but it's I've hit my fucking breaking point I need the
2891620	2898100	gaming companies and the the cable companies to fucking figure out this bandwidth issue and I need
2898100	2907700	gaming companies specifically EA Electronic Arts and BioWare I need them to figure and honestly
2907700	2911620	let's say Activision as well because I know they're guilty of this shit with Call of Duty
2911620	2916020	and I don't even play it you guys need to figure out this fucking patching problem these day one
2916020	2921860	patches these 70 80 gig patches because we don't have the fucking bandwidth for it and I'm at the
2921860	2926420	point where I'm not going to buy games anymore if I hear that there is these gigantic fucking
2926420	2931140	patches on day one because apparently the game is just fucking broken to begin with
2932500	2940420	like it's it's I I my mind is blown that there's a second disc and it doesn't do anything now at
2940420	2946100	this point and of course I've I've tried to do the Twitter thing where I've to nicely mind you
2946100	2951620	much nicer than I am now tweeting EA help Xbox support BioWare Mass Effect tweeting everybody
2951620	2955700	saying uh does this is this too not supposed to do anything am I doing something wrong what's
2955700	2960340	going on nothing of course not I'm just some jackass on Twitter they're not going to respond
2960340	2966980	to me who cares but I know I'm not the only one facing this issue and it's just and there's a lot
2966980	2971060	of people out there who don't care because they're like oh I've got unlimited bandwidth or oh I love
2971060	2975300	Mass Effect so much whatever I'm just going to take the 30 gig hit or whatever but like
2975860	2982980	as time goes on and as these you know things go on with COVID and and all this stuff like these
2982980	2990740	bandwidth issues are getting worse and worse so what am I what am and what so I dropped 60 bucks
2990740	2998340	on the game I I I opted to I could have actually gotten the game cheaper digitally because of the
2998340	3003620	Xbox game pass agreement and that whole thing with EA I could have actually gotten the game
3003620	3008980	cheaper I could have gotten it for like 52 dollars that way but I actually opted to pay the 60
3008980	3014020	dollars so that I wouldn't have to worry about the bandwidth thing and this is what happens
3017700	3024740	I also want to stress this is one example of things that are wrong with the game again the
3024740	3030340	game crashed on the as series x as I was playing through it later on Dark Soccer is going to bring
3030340	3034420	up some other stuff later that I know is affecting PCs and some people that are in some similar
3034420	3044100	issues what's like I've hit I'm sorry I'm just speechless because I in my mind I've hit this
3044100	3050500	point where suddenly some of these things we've laughed at and called frivolous lawsuits no longer
3050500	3058260	feel frivolous to me I want EA and Activision to be held accountable for this unnecessary shit that
3058260	3065220	hits my bandwidth I really do because I don't know what else is going to stop this trend
3070660	3075060	and I don't know it's not gonna they're not gonna do anything until it hits them financially
3075060	3081940	exactly exactly it's not gonna hit them financially so they're never gonna stop and it's
3081940	3086660	more like it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was like if the internet companies weren't the way
3086660	3092900	that they are and maybe and maybe that's what has and maybe that's what has to give in this
3092900	3097620	situation I don't know but it's still kind of weird though like you would think though that
3097620	3101300	it would prior illing because even like just not even necessarily bandwidth but like you're
3101300	3107060	unnecessarily like making people wait to download something and then install it when you have the
3107060	3110900	data on the disk that you just purchased why wouldn't you just use that I would think that
3110980	3118340	would even just be faster like I don't understand what the point is just just so I'm clear also
3118340	3122980	this does appear to be and somebody in chat if you know definitively can correct me from
3122980	3129460	this does appear to be an issue that is unique to Xbox because the PlayStation 5 discs
3130260	3137060	disc the one disc is labeled put me in first installation disc and then the other one is the
3137060	3145220	play disc oh yeah it's still fresh and honestly the way and that's just the way the PlayStation
3145220	3149860	5 is built with the whole backwards compatibility thing and the Xbox is built and for most
3149860	3154900	circumstances Xbox has kind of had the better backwards compatibility system but in this one
3154900	3160500	very specific case unfortunately it's it's it's fucked things up with the whole patch and
3160500	3167860	everything yeah E3VL is in chat saying second disc just launcher on Xbox second disc does
3167860	3174740	nothing but tell you to put in disc one believe me guys I've tried this every way you can think of
3174740	3179460	BioWare needs to put out a patch that allows you to install from the disc instead of automatically
3179460	3186980	going to the internet the disc I paid for that now does nothing to to do that and I I could
3186980	3196260	uninstall the 11 gigs I just did and start from scratch but that's I don't even know if that would
3196260	3204100	be a guarantee to work though number one and number two I shouldn't fucking have to and I've
3204100	3211940	had it so as much as I you know now that I've got and I've played Mass Effect and I've just you know
3211940	3217300	grinned and bared it through some of the crashes things like that and it's it's a great it's a
3217300	3224580	great remaster and you know what Mass Effect Andromeda had a lot of great shit in it and what
3224580	3233060	ruined it stupid shit that was rushed out too quick and that is why do I want to say it I'm
3233060	3237300	gonna say it this clip this is gonna haunt me so this is somebody's gonna clip this it's gonna
3237300	3243780	fucking haunt me I don't care this is why I am not buying the next Mass Effect game day one
3245620	3246420	I'm not gonna do it
3248900	3253940	this happened with the legendary edition this happened with Mass Effect Andromeda
3253940	3258660	this really happened with Anthem did this happen with Dragon Age Inquisition Dark Sakura I don't
3258660	3264900	remember not really Dragon Age Inquisition worked fine from day one okay yay so more more of that
3264980	3270820	when I started playing it I didn't notice a problem and less of your track records
3270820	3277860	you've recently developed under EA I've had it well and they also need to have arm support just
3277860	3286820	saying I I'm not gonna play the new Mass Effect because I know it's gonna get patched after a
3286820	3293540	month or two there's gonna be problems when it first releases and I'm putting my foot down this
3293620	3300100	is one of my favorite franchises ever and I really want to support the team and I am so sorry to the
3300100	3305140	team and I'm so sorry to the people that this affects when they have nothing to do with it
3305940	3316660	but I've had it period going to chat quest buster says I can echo dark soccer on Inquisition it
3316660	3320100	installed and worked right from the start for me too okay great let's have more of that then
3320100	3325780	great but unfortunately I just named three in a row that are that are a little busted let's see
3326980	3334020	uh let's see RHM087 in chat says relatively small potatoes but I'm a little salty the switch card
3334020	3340820	for Starlink Battle for Atlas requires an update of around 10 gigs out of the box yes not a fair
3340820	3347860	comparison since switch cards can't hold as much data as a blu-ray okay that doesn't discount your
3347860	3353780	point and what you're saying though is that this is an industry-wide problem it really is
3353780	3361540	like we have to do something about this day one 80 gig patch culture this is enough is enough
3361540	3368420	like okay a small a couple of gigs to patch things you know okay but this is too much this has to
3368420	3373060	stop and gamers gamers have to be willing to speak with their wallets and have to be willing
3373060	3378500	to forego some things their heart really wants to give him on and that's why I said what I said
3378500	3383700	about the next Mass Effect game when it releases in what 2024 2025 whenever it is and that's why
3383700	3388980	I'm like I'm probably gonna regret saying that because it's so far out but I've had it I've had
3388980	3396980	it so Bobby Blackwolf we were talking at the end of your show I said you might want to wait now
3396980	3402260	you know why because it's the same thing you might as well wait till they patch the crashing is the
3402260	3408260	trilogy will be great and the trilogy will still be there and I know the industry lives and dies
3408260	3412420	on you know how much a game sells in its first week but that is something that's going to need
3412420	3416740	to change too because I'm sick and fucking tired of buying games in the first week to have this
3416740	3426900	shit happen and going back to the comment on what RHM said Nintendo is about the only company
3427780	3435700	I trust to do this right I may get proven wrong in the future but Nintendo is about the only
3435700	3439620	company that's doing it right so I think I'll continue to buy Nintendo games the day they
3439620	3445060	come out but everybody else can go fuck themselves until they figure this out all right unless it's
3445060	3452100	a Dragon Age game no oh no I won't be buying Dragon Age day one either trust I I am well
3452100	3456260	and that's that's fine I'm not telling anyone else they have to do anything I'm saying I've had it
3457140	3463220	and I'll buy Dragon Age once I hear once I get the validation it's fine it works you know it's it's
3463220	3468820	okay well and you know me any of those games I don't play on console anyway yeah I know and a
3468820	3473700	lot of there have been a lot of people saying that that a lot of people playing on Steam are having
3473700	3480420	an okay time of it yeah but what again if you get past all this bullshit like I said there's a great
3480420	3485620	game in there just like just like Dark Soccer just like Mass Effect Andromeda it was a great game it
3485620	3491780	got ruined it got ruined by all this bullshit and it's it I feel like the guy in Twin Peaks
3491780	3497300	and the Red Lodge sitting there going or sorry the Black Lodge going it's happening again it is
3497300	3506500	happening again I I am gonna say my Andromeda worked perfectly as well from day one so all
3506500	3510820	right I've been very preachy I'm sorry there's gonna be people that are like Rob's too preachy
3510980	3516340	I have feelings okay I just think that we should also bear in mind that for some people your
3516340	3522580	mileage may vary yes that is true and um and maybe maybe you don't give a shit because you
3522580	3527140	have unlimited bandwidth good for you good for you know because I would like to know what part
3527140	3534260	of the world well they would like to be a part of that world they live in I installed 96 gigabytes
3534260	3539860	on my virtual machine and there's a very good play there's a very good chance folks in the northeast
3539860	3546420	who have Comcast haven't had because uh Comcast ended up pushing back that bandwidth cap thing
3546420	3551300	until next year because they were under pressure with coronavirus and everything that's great for
3551300	3557140	the northeast love you guys but what the fuck about the rest of us and this and my anger
3557700	3564180	is just as much directed to cable internet providers and the fact that in many parts of
3564180	3569540	the country we don't have choice on so we're stuck with a lot of this stuff especially in this you
3569540	3575380	know very internet tuned in age where that cap hasn't really changed I think they might have
3575380	3580260	said oh we bumped it up 10 percent big fucking deal I have some suggestions for you offline
3580260	3585540	yeah I know well there's some other things but we'll talk offline about that so anyway
3585540	3590900	all right um I've preached enough I'm sorry but I have I had feelings I got something to say
3591780	3596420	I do actually have something that I want to bring up if that's okay just a quick thing
3596420	3601060	yes I'm sorry I'm just now looking at I was so preachy I wasn't looking at my watch go ahead
3601060	3607780	Darcyra it's all right so um oh hi Renee Renee's in chat who I haven't seen in a long time me neither
3607780	3615300	um but um as everyone knows I'm from Alabama and we've uh talked to uh my mama son before
3615300	3625380	she sang a song for us um well one of uh one of her roommates that there's you know uh my mama
3625380	3632660	son my papa son uh another friend and then uh uh another friend who's actually been mama son's
3632660	3641380	best friend for a long time um but she is in hospital on a ventilator due to pneumonia and
3641380	3648580	covid and um I would just like some good vibes if y'all don't mind just some good vibes to
3648580	3656660	send uh k kitty's way I'm very sorry to hear that yeah she's she's my best an amazing person
3656660	3663060	you know she's one of those people that's better than she thinks she is so good vibes please and
3663060	3669140	please please get vaccinated please like yes yes like I know people that the vaccines are
3669140	3673780	experimental no the mr mrna stuff's been researched for years and if you've ever
3673780	3679380	taken a flu shot there's a new one of those every year as well so guess what like the the
3679380	3685780	vaccine's been around long enough like like just get the vaccine just all right yeah well and
3685780	3695300	thankfully I mean the rollout for vaccines in Alabama has been atrocious um thankfully finally
3695300	3700820	somebody in that house is vaccinated or on the way to being vaccinated my mother still hasn't
3700820	3710260	been she's like I can't find a place to do it and so wow I'm really disappointed I'm I'm and that's
3710260	3716420	I'm glad to hear a mild word knowing your mom and knowing um because I it blows my mind the vaccines
3716420	3721300	have become a political issue and that is so frustrating but knowing that your mom has a
3721300	3725860	certain stance when it comes to politics I'm really glad to hear and this is something I'm
3725860	3730100	hearing more and more which I'm very thankful is that people's parents as their kids are like
3730100	3733860	fuck yeah I'm getting vaccinated people's parents are kind of like coming around a little bit so
3733860	3739860	like I'm I'm really happy to hear that I'm sorry about the fact she can't find one right now but
3739860	3747700	I'm really happy to hear that she's open to getting one yeah um and I'm I'm trying to do a little bit
3747700	3756500	of you know digging uh on her behalf and uh I I don't know it's just I'm really worried and this
3756500	3760820	one hits really close to home because if I was still in Alabama who knows what state I'd be in
3760820	3769380	sure sure yeah so again it goes back to seriousness um and if I remember correctly I think she's
3770340	3780580	in her late 50s I think this friend of mine so just be get vaccinated get your friends and
3780580	3791940	parents and whoever harp on them so just do it um because I know I'm going to be heartbroken
3791940	3798340	if if I lose my friend all right well I I really really hope she comes around so fingers not to be
3798340	3806420	a bummer no it's it's it's one of those nights here at OLR sorry we have feelings yeah I'm just
3806420	3811700	laughing at a just because I don't know what other expression to have right now um anyway
3811700	3816420	uh I will say you know what the nice thing about being vaccinated um you know uh Allen and I are
3816420	3821140	both he got a shot uh his second shot and he's he's through the motions where he's fully vaccinated
3821140	3826660	I'm fully vaccinated we actually went to a small gathering of uh also other vaccinated people last
3826660	3832020	night probably like eight people I know in the area it felt so good you guys it's been like a
3832020	3836340	year and a half and it's like the extrovert in me was like you know and we were only there for like
3836340	3840980	an hour because it was a chance thing we went out to dinner downtown and it was like a friend
3840980	3844580	messaged and said you should come over and we like fuck yeah we will everybody's vaxxed right yep
3844580	3852580	okay let's do it so um it felt so good so I'm it's like it's a taste of what the other side can look
3852580	3858980	like if people will just please please get the vaccine all right I ran into a friend after I
3859700	3868420	was almost past my uh second vaccine and uh uh and he had been vaccinated and I just and we
3868420	3874340	just both went screw it and gave each other a hug and it's one of the first non-friend hugs I have
3874340	3883060	had in almost two years um Bobby Black Wolfenchat says and I can also explain to you why Costco
3883060	3887860	asking if you're vaccinated is not a HIPAA violation that is correct that is not a HIPAA
3887860	3892580	violation and as somebody who worked in the healthcare industry for 18 years and designed
3892580	3897780	HIPAA training for a company with thousands of employees that took the HIPAA training I will
3897780	3903380	stress to you HIPAA has to do with information and how it is conveyed from one health insurance
3903380	3908100	entity or I'm sorry excuse me a covered entity which means a healthcare provider or a healthcare
3908100	3914900	clearinghouse anybody handing handling healthcare data to another it has nothing to do with um
3914900	3919780	disclosures personal disclosure your own personal disclosures you can that me telling you I got
3919780	3925220	vaccinated that's not a fucking HIPAA violation because that's me disclosing it to you and Costco
3925220	3928580	asking that question to you is not a HIPAA violation because they're not doing anything
3928580	3931540	with your health insurance information that's a question they're asking you so you can get
3931540	3936100	through the door that is their policy and they have the right to set it as when I was a massage
3936100	3941140	therapist I also had to adhere to HIPAA which basically meant that some third party could not
3941140	3948340	come to me and ask about someone's medical conditions we signed the document I did not
3948340	3957860	disclose it basically HIPAA is a huge NDA on a personal level yeah one could argue that if Costco
3957860	3963060	then told what you said to somebody else then they would be violating HIPAA but actually Costco is not
3963060	3969460	really they they're not a they're not storing your data so it's a very different situation but anyway
3969460	3973060	we can get into the nuances if you'd like but I'd rather talk about video games right now
3974020	3980260	get my mind off of this all right let's talk HIPAA nuances no no we've had enough off topic tonight
3980260	3985220	all right let's get into past seven o'clock and not even on our first fucking story so Loki
3985220	3992500	please all right so uh I don't know this isn't really much of a shock I think but Sony is saying
3992500	3997940	that they expect that the PlayStation 5 shortage is going to continue into next year the reason
3997940	4005780	for that is the continuing chip shortage and the um the demand still staying quite high through
4005780	4016260	2021 so basically the financial chief officer uh Hiroki uh Toki basically said that um I don't
4016260	4020500	think the demand is coming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many
4020500	4027220	more units of PlayStation 5 next year our supply won't be able to catch up with demand so continue
4027220	4038020	to expect um ridiculous queues and scalpers yay but I mean to be fair I mean not a lot of games
4038020	4043780	coming out like I don't know it I still wonder when some of these first party like really big
4043780	4048820	titles are coming out there I mean Returnal came out I guess recently but like more of
4049380	4055620	system seller type things like I haven't yet seen anything necessarily that I needed to have day one
4055620	4060740	even with the series x which I did get you know at launch there wasn't really anything that's like
4060740	4067860	oh my god I gotta get this system because of this right now yeah so I I'll have to wait and see um
4067860	4072340	She-Hulk 10 in chat is uh saying it's not a chip shortage they just don't want to pay more for the
4072340	4077700	chips yeah they don't want to their loss is only so much that they're willing to lose it no it's
4077700	4083860	still it's still a shortage because being that the supply is low that the demand is high that
4083860	4088980	the prices go up so it's still technically a shortage it's just that you know they don't want
4088980	4096020	to pay the the inflated price because of the shortage but you know you hopefully you know with
4096020	4103140	maybe the interest in cryptocurrency I don't know if it's waning it's still pretty popular um but I
4103140	4109940	know there's just a lot of demand right now so maybe that we'll see more factories you know or
4109940	4114580	I don't know if it's necessarily the you know the manufacturing of it or the actual silicon that's
4114580	4120740	you know in short supply but I guess we'll have to wait and see if it calms down sounds very 80s
4120740	4126420	Nintendo I'm I'm really glad and I'm not gonna usually hype up what this guy says at all but I
4126420	4133060	am gonna give my polite golf clap to um Elon Musk who's been quite the face of a lot of this
4133060	4137380	cryptocurrency stuff at least he's been using his platform to kind of say in these past few days
4137380	4141060	hey we need to look at something that's more green and that's something that's not like using
4141060	4144580	so damn much energy when it comes to this cryptocurrency stuff so I will give one round
4144580	4150580	of polite applause to at least folks that have a voice to be able to um realize that something's
4150580	4155460	got to change with all that craziness uh when it and look I'm guilty of it too I've gotten in on
4155460	4160900	the cryptocurrency thing just a little bit uh but I don't mind it you know I I've been basically
4160900	4168020	legalized gambling with it uh is is what it is so uh just tell them to stop putting brain uh
4168020	4172980	chips and pig heads and chickens and all that yeah anyway anyway um but back to the PlayStation
4172980	4179620	issue um I will say uh you know I'm bummed because yeah I'd like to pick up a PlayStation 5
4179620	4183140	especially with Returnal I've been watching friends play that and stream it and it looks
4183140	4188020	like a lot of fun and a type of game I'd be into it looks really cool but I like I just I'm like
4188020	4191060	I'm not gonna fight scalpers and all this stuff there's still that part of me it's like I will
4191060	4195460	get a PlayStation when I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf that then I'll know
4195460	4201300	it's for me um I don't really want to play these fucking games now if Final Fantasy 16 releases
4201300	4206500	this year I reserve the right to change my tune but I don't think it will and I don't think I will
4207140	4212020	so um but we'll see we'll see I'm not I'm not gonna say it as definitively as I said the other
4212020	4216420	thing I'm gonna regret um but if I can walk into the store and pick one up off the shelf I'll be
4216420	4223220	happy to do that um let's see uh Pele Hanumea in chat says whichever system had 20 million
4223220	4227700	consoles ready at launch could have won the console wars this gen easily that was always
4227700	4234660	going to be hard during COVID and even though COVID is declining as we're seeing it in the
4234660	4239860	states as more people are getting vaccinated I hope everybody realizes a lot of your gaming
4239860	4245700	consoles don't come from the states they come from other places where maybe COVID vaccinations
4245700	4251060	aren't getting around as much as well so yes COVID is still an issue even if it is an issue
4251060	4258980	in your house right now so um yeah anyhow um okay let's move on and talk a little bit about Xbox
4258980	4264260	because this is one of those things about Xbox as much as I've advocated for them uh on the program
4264260	4267220	this is one of those things that kind of didn't make sense and I'm kind of glad that they're going
4267220	4272340	to be addressing this and that is with the quick review uh resume excuse me quick resume feature
4272340	4277780	that's the one that allows you to like pick up a game and go which by the way also crashed my mass
4277780	4284980	effect game earlier today but I said I'd move on um the quick resume future is uh allows you to
4284980	4289860	pick up a game without a lot of loading time or waiting and kind of flip from one thing to another
4289860	4296180	um but it's hard to tell like what games are actually in the system's memory right now and
4296180	4301300	what's been pushed out well the good news is uh the quick resume feature is going to be getting
4301300	4307620	a little bit of a facelift with the upcoming Xbox update this month so you can see what games do you
4307620	4314260	currently have suspended on your series x or series s depending on what you're using um that's
4314260	4318820	going to be nice uh especially as more and more games are supposed to be supporting it as well
4318820	4325780	um they say uh in a announcement you will be able to list all the games currently saved in quick
4325780	4330580	resume and you can also pin that thing on your dashboard so you can get to that quickly which
4330580	4336420	is kind of cool as well uh on a somewhat related note uh Microsoft also released some new themes
4336420	4343220	uh with Xbox one uh excuse me well Xbox one and series x uh including a like anniversary background
4343220	4348260	that lets you uh kind of relive what the old school Xbox look like and uh it's kind of a neat
4348260	4352980	theme I also really like green so um I've been using that theme lately which is um kind of fun
4353620	4361620	so all right moving on dark sakura I I promised we'd get to this I I've been staring happily at
4361620	4369620	this picture of garris for a little while because he's space husband so basically um with the mass
4369620	4374820	effect legendary edition launch um of course people are having issues you know you spoke of
4374820	4381300	your own um but uh a few people are already encountering just some other in-game problems
4381780	4388900	uh one user on uh in a thread on reddit says happens walking around on citadel and spontaneously
4388900	4395780	when interacting to talk with npcs the game just disappears but I can hear the sound and task
4395780	4402100	manager it is not responding and I have to force quit and reload um other people are saying that
4402100	4409220	they're experiencing the same thing um several are saying that they're unable to uh launch the game
4409860	4415540	um and then they have like the the boot going in circles um
4417380	4423860	trying to you know like origin isn't even loading um and you know I wonder if some of that might be
4423860	4429460	why mine's not playing in compatibility mode but then again like I said uh I did by the
4429460	4438020	let's doing the same thing um on steam itself um it'll it'll get to the first boot and then
4438100	4446660	trying to launch the origin client it crashes um but there's other options that people are missing
4446660	4457060	as well so um it only supports the combat and interactive gameplay in 21.9 the cut scenes though
4457060	4466420	all go back to 16.9 using uh pillar boxes um the aspect ratio basically this one I like the term
4466500	4475620	for this they're saying it gives a sense of visual whiplash um and no one has made anything about it
4475620	4481780	um there's no graphical options no forced mouse acceleration no field of view slider
4482820	4490180	pillar box ultra wide um so yeah people are just talking about mods and patches to fix the port so
4491060	4499540	I'm I'm kind of glad that I'm not gonna play it yet um and I'm actually just watching like a little
4499540	4510500	video of people going through this so um I hear myself echoing anyway um at any rate though I think
4511300	4521700	that uh there's a lot for them to fix we're gonna see more more patches and I mean I wouldn't be
4521700	4526900	surprised that even if this is something that's on purpose that there's gonna be something up on
4526900	4533540	nexus to change it too I mean I don't know if these people are playing full screen or playing
4533540	4539220	windowed or what have you I mean there's a reason why I typically play my games windowed anyway
4539220	4547300	I get a little bit less of of that uh that massive change but even so I mean I'm on an
4547300	4551300	ultra wide screen monitor what's gonna happen when I try to play it you know
4553780	4558900	hopefully the modders have fixed the game since apparently it wasn't totally done I I don't know
4558900	4564660	it's just it's and and here's the bummer here's the real bummer especially when I'm talking to
4564660	4571060	people like bobby who is like I've always been I'm paraphrasing what I'm hearing um but bobby's
4571060	4575700	like you know I the way you guys talk about mass effect all the fucking time maybe there's
4575700	4579780	something I'm missing maybe I ought to pick this up maybe I ought to play this legendary edition
4579780	4587620	now that it's in 4k and it's pretty and I hate I hate to say give it like three months because
4587620	4593700	he may not be interested in three months and he may mean you know but but the reality is is that
4593700	4597860	it's unfortunately I think it's gonna take a little while for them to get these problems
4597860	4603460	fixed and it's just like one of those bummers where it's like I wish they would have had it
4603460	4608900	right on day one and I'm not telling people wait three months for them to do all the patches that
4608900	4616420	will definitively fix the game well see and now I want to go back on my uh my virtual computer and
4617300	4624020	try to load the first mass effect um but I mean when I was playing through mass effect two and
4624020	4631620	three um because I think they were easier to mod those two I had basically super high res
4631620	4644580	mods that would work in 1080 right and I I don't see how like what did they reprogram it's the same
4644820	4650100	engine they boosted graphics pretty much I mean they might have I mean the the first one of course
4650100	4658020	was revamped to work on that engine but I don't really I don't really get it you know well they
4658020	4662660	went in under the hood and did stuff to combat and the Mako so I mean I think they did more
4662660	4671060	with that one than two and three but yeah but yeah but I don't know it's just I I guess I'm
4671140	4679060	having a hard time phrasing what I want to say I it makes my heart hurt it's just it's just
4679060	4683860	disappointment because we know there is a good game in there and we know this shouldn't be
4683860	4693460	happening but it does and it's it's frustrating to put it lightly it's like it's like when you're
4693460	4700740	served like a layered casserole and the top layer is like half cooked turnips but underneath that
4700740	4705780	you got some lamb you got some chicken and some cheese or something you just need to
4705780	4714340	get past the turnips what was that trifle with beef and potatoes all right let's move on to the
4714340	4724100	next story which I think Loki's talking about yeah so Target has decided to post where they're
4724900	4731220	discontinuing selling Pokemon cards at their physical locations right now and this is
4731220	4736260	including actually a lot of different type of collector cards because they've had issues with
4736260	4741460	grown adults fighting each other in parking lots trying to get some of these more sought after
4741460	4746900	packs so apparently the restriction kicked in earlier this week they're going to no longer
4746900	4754660	sell the NFL, NBA, MLB, and Pokemon cards except online you can order them through their online
4754660	4759860	stores they just don't want you coming to their locations and having altercations in the parking
4759860	4767220	lot because you really wanted you know some foil card or something like that so it's grown adults
4767220	4772740	I mean what are you gonna do but yeah that's I think they're not the only store too I think
4772740	4779220	Walmart's also been cracking down on selling stuff as well so it's just can we just please
4779220	4786340	act like adults please I mean come on act Efton chat says the summary to the story FU scalpers
4786340	4792660	and E3VL in chat says scalpers need to keep themselves in check Quest Buster says this is
4792660	4797780	why we can't have nice things and Tiger Claw says it's because those cards have gone up in value
4798740	4803620	all of that yeah like it's the scalping culture I bet a lot of those people fighting over cards
4803620	4807780	are just going to flip them online and so they see it as money and people trying to steal their
4807780	4813860	money and when people try to steal money they want to fight about it and this is probably where
4813860	4820580	a lot of the scalping stuff has to get fixed too and ebay and facebook markets and all these things
4820580	4824180	really need to come together to figure out what they're going to do about scalping but you know
4824260	4831140	of course others will say well there's not a lot you can do um one thing I do like though what was
4831140	4836420	it there was a store I bought something on recently and it had I think it was actually
4836420	4842820	Square Enix when I bought the expansion for Endwalker actually um who's who's who's getting
4842820	4846660	a lot of praise from me tonight for doing things right and this is another one I wasn't even
4846660	4852580	planning but I bought the expansion and it actually texted me a code to my phone because
4852580	4856420	it was just kind of like we just need to um check this order I don't know what it was actually
4856420	4861140	checking behind the scenes or whatever but it texted me a code and I had to put in that code
4861140	4868420	but I noticed by doing that it also is making sure that I have a number in the region that I'm trying
4868420	4874740	to buy the game in uh that I'm only getting one that I'm one person and it also kind of slows
4874740	4880580	things down because I have to put in this code and all this stuff so I would love to see more
4880580	4885140	retailers kind of do this force two-factor verification which kind of slows the process
4885140	4888820	of buying things down so it's hard to do and yes I know there will be some people that are still
4888820	4892740	probably able to find a way around it and so forth but it will really cut down their their speed of
4892740	4900740	that sort of thing I think so uh ZenMonkey11 says they can't stop it it's the culture only the fans
4900740	4907140	can stop it and uh you know there there is there is very much truth in the fact that if this wanted
4907220	4912580	to end tomorrow it could if everybody could just agree to not buy from scalpers anymore
4913540	4920340	but unfortunately there's some people that are going to do whatever they want to get their kid
4920340	4926580	their damn Pokemon card um and that's another part of our culture that's kind of disappointing
4926580	4934020	I guess uh yeah Tiger Claw says the problem is eBay is enabling all this I agree but they're
4934020	4938340	making money off of it this might be a thing where the government has to step in and regulate
4938340	4943060	it or at least do that thing where they threaten if you don't fix this problem we will that's what
4943060	4947780	I'd like to see happen if you don't fix this problem we will you're starting to see a little
4947780	4952020	bit of that because I do believe the current administration or congress one of the two maybe
4952020	4960420	both kind of have said that this whole chip shortage stuff this is an issue fix it so there
4960420	4968340	you see it's starting to go that direction so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on talk
4968340	4973620	about something that's happy and wonderful and that is the upcoming 35th anniversary of Dragon
4973620	4980180	Quest did you know that series is 35 years old that's exciting and depressing all at once because
4980180	4983620	I don't know about you guys but I have fond memories of playing the first game when it first
4983620	4987780	came out in America anyway when it was Dragon Warrior and I know we got it a little later but
4987780	4993300	still you know it wasn't wasn't that long after and uh yeah 35 years Dragon Quest will be doing
4993300	4999220	a special 35th anniversary stream on May 26 to celebrate it and they're going to be giving all
4999220	5004660	the latest information on the latest Dragon Quest games so you know keep in mind there's like a
5004660	5009060	Dragon Quest cell phone game uh they're I think they did a Dragon Quest version of theater them
5009060	5014660	at one point in Japan only I don't know but the one that has everybody excited there may maybe
5014660	5018980	there'll be a builders 3 that would be pretty exciting actually but the real thing that has
5018980	5024820	people excited is that could this be a Dragon Quest 12 and there's strong hints that this is
5024820	5030420	going to be an announcement of Dragon Quest 12 of course the last game in the series was uh Dragon
5030420	5035540	Quest 11 uh but that's been out for a little while you know to the point that we're getting these
5035540	5042660	like enhanced of definitive edition re-releases on Xbox when you know it was out on the the switch
5042660	5049300	in Japan and uh the the PlayStation 4 in both regions for quite some time so I'm expecting
5049300	5053140	that we're going to hear what console the new Dragon Quest game is for if that's going to be
5053140	5058020	a Switch thing as well uh or what they're going if they're going to do Xbox parody as well who knows
5058020	5064900	uh we're going to hear all of that hopefully uh at this stream on um I said 26th of May but
5064900	5073780	actually I'm hearing the event starts at on May 28th at 8 30 pacific time so maybe is there two
5073780	5077540	of it I think maybe it's just a typo in this story because I'm looking at a big graphic that says
5077540	5085140	May 26th is when this is all happening so um look forward to some news in that capacity um
5085140	5090260	Dr Tetsuya in chat says I did finally get around to finishing Dragon Quest 11 this last year yeah
5090260	5095380	you know the Xbox release made me take another look at it so that was fun now if that's not
5095380	5100180	enough for you how about some Dragon Quest in the real world did you know there is a
5100180	5105460	Dragon Quest island that is going to be opening actually it opened yesterday uh this is the
5106180	5113380	Nijigen no Mori amusement park uh that has this attraction it's this little Dragon Quest land
5113380	5120660	um I guess you it's there's interesting pricing tiers to this uh and then you know some different
5120660	5125140	rides and things uh with all this it's been delayed a little bit because of COVID-19
5125140	5131060	but it did finally open so fun I'd love to visit someday um but probably not going to be anytime
5131060	5139860	soon all right Dark Sakura what do you have for us um I have some stuff about PlayStation and Steam
5140820	5149380	so PlayStation's Steam page is live and there's actually something that's listing number first of
5149380	5158180	all it lists 41 pieces of content but only about half of it is visible so that's 41 games and their
5158180	5167220	DLC associated with the Sony division but there's only 24 things that you can see so um the only ones
5167220	5175060	available to purchase right now is horizon uh horizon zero dawn predator hunting grounds and
5175060	5186260	hell divers um days gone is set to release later in the month but um they uh they're saying that
5186260	5190980	they want a lot more to come out they have a whole bunch of games coming out and it looks like the
5190980	5195940	evidence for it was there it's just this stuff isn't there to see yet I think we've got you know
5195940	5199620	hidden placeholders or something yeah it's interesting that there's like you know this is
5199620	5204820	going to this level of where they have like their own branded page and stuff and I know um there
5204820	5209700	wasn't as much juicy news out of that court thing this week but one thing we did get it from the
5209700	5215140	court thing last week was uh the whole news about that PlayStation it had a conversation with Steam
5215140	5220420	and and this looks to be something uh that that could be a result of that I'm sure there were
5220420	5225460	other things discussed too but definitely it seems to be there's um a tighter partnership there and
5225540	5233860	so that's interesting yeah so all right well I think Loki has some more PlayStation things
5235300	5239700	yeah so this is exciting I'm always trying to figure out what you know they're going to be
5239700	5246900	doing for PlayStation VR too and here's some more like kind of from a reliable source type of thing
5247540	5253940	so Uploaded VR had done a kind of a piece talking about the technology that's going to be
5253940	5260820	in the next PlayStation VR so some of that including foveted rendering which for those
5260820	5266580	who don't know it's using eye tracking to render just the highest resolution image
5267460	5272420	where you're directly looking and then everything around that would be lower resolution and then as
5272420	5278260	you change where you're looking at it would actually alter where it's rendering the highest
5278260	5283300	you know resolution part of that image so it allows it to save some bandwidth being able to
5283300	5288740	just render um a smaller section of the screen at a higher resolution with everything else being
5288740	5294820	a little bit less um in focus I guess uh they're saying that that sounds like straight up science
5294820	5301540	fiction that's crazy yeah it's pretty crazy um they had the uh there's gonna be an IPD adjustment
5301540	5306500	dial which is kind of uh typical with a lot of the headsets out there uh per eye resolution they're
5306500	5312660	saying is uh 2,000 by 2040 pixels um they're doing the inside out tracking kind of like the
5312660	5318500	most modern um headsets out there right now uh also they're saying that they're going to have
5318500	5323300	the haptic feedback which I assume is going to be the same type of stuff that we had um with the
5323300	5330580	DualSense 4 controllers so uh I'm sorry they're new uh controllers that they have that have that
5330580	5334500	enhanced haptic feedback I'm assuming those are going to be in the new controllers that they
5334500	5342020	put out images for not too long ago um it's still going to be a wired headset which is fine but
5342020	5347140	being that technology has gotten a lot better than what it was with the original PlayStation VR
5347140	5355700	it's just one USB type-c cable I believe which I think that's pretty manageable um what else that
5358500	5364580	we don't know when it's coming out yet of course not of course not and uh you know haven't really
5364580	5371300	seen anything confirmed yet these are just you know like I said you know from a reliable source
5372020	5376820	right now so it's all rumors and speculation until we actually get some news from Sony but
5376820	5383060	maybe this year maybe we'll find out I'm assuming some next year maybe yeah I would be shocked if
5383060	5388740	PSVR is a thing for this year I really especially in light of the continuing supply issues and
5388740	5394340	things like that um I think it'd be really wild to try to put out a VR unit when you can't put
5394340	5399540	out enough consoles to meet the demand so I I would say for that reason alone PlayStation VR
5399540	5406500	for PlayStation 5 has to be at least another year out um but I I don't make sure bets on anything
5406500	5415860	anymore exactly well I mean it's just it sounds cool I hope all that's true now um some interesting
5415860	5421300	perspective in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network uh Bobby Blackwolf our pal uh
5421300	5429380	in chat is saying um that uh I'm very interested in seeing how this will work with my astigmatism
5429380	5435140	which means my eyes jiggle a lot I haven't tried any eye tracking headsets yet and you know what
5435140	5439940	Bobby uh is talking about there that's not exactly an uncommon thing there's a there's quite a few
5439940	5446980	people out there with astigmatism uh that uh I deal with it yeah and so so what's gonna happen
5446980	5452020	you know is there a way to turn this feature off that Loki's talking about or is it gonna
5452020	5456660	compensate for that somehow or I I don't know because I don't develop this stuff um but it'd be
5457620	5460980	some of those accessibility type of things are very interesting questions
5461940	5466740	especially when we're talking about new technology with VR I mean I I hope everybody gets to enjoy
5466740	5471700	it I would assume though it's very fast I mean assuming that most of these a lot of the newer
5471700	5478100	headsets you know render at about 120 megahertz I mean that's that's pretty fast I think that's
5478100	5483540	a lot faster than your eye can move so I would assume that assuming that the eye tracking is
5483540	5488020	that good and it would have to be if it's you know putting the rendering or it's basing the
5488020	5493860	rendering where you're looking um that's going to be interesting it's also going to be interesting
5493860	5498500	that they sell that data and use you know advertisements like oh let's we can now measure
5498500	5502980	advertising your advertisement engagement and stuff like that yeah that's pretty dicey there's
5502980	5508820	lots of evil yeah uh evil possibilities Bobby in chat says you don't know how fast my eyes can move
5508820	5514420	against my will well I will say this I I look to Bobby to be a voice on this because I know he's a
5514420	5520100	huge VR enthusiast he talks a lot about it on his show he works a lot with VR stuff um so so I know
5520100	5526020	I'm going to get the answer from Bobby uh when uh the PS gets closer to release and I imagine you
5526020	5529700	know I don't think they're going to talk about any of this on a big stage but I imagine they will
5529700	5534020	address some of the stuff behind the scenes when it comes to things like accessibility and what
5534020	5540900	about this what about that you know um it'll be it'll be interesting to see so all right well let
5540900	5544820	us move on and I'm going to talk a little bit about speaking of announcement type of things
5544820	5551700	uh EA Play uh you know they usually do a thing uh it kind of concurrently with e3 because e3's
5551700	5555780	changed a lot and I'm not just talking about the COVID thing but you know EA started doing their
5555780	5560180	own thing across the street and EA is going to be continuing to do its own thing this year and
5560180	5566660	what's interesting to me is that it's a little ways out it's on July 22nd this time so it's not
5566660	5572020	exactly when e3 is happening which um you know there there's probably great reasons for that
5572020	5576660	probably so they can you know have every additional day to work on trailers and things like that so
5576660	5582420	we'll see um I also think it's interesting they really invoke their old school logo
5582420	5587700	back when they were eca of the square the sphere and the triangle if you didn't know
5587700	5592660	that dates all the way back to eca and what the the loading screen would look like on old games
5592660	5597860	but anyway just a little tangent there uh they did announce it's coming back on july 22nd of course
5597860	5602900	we have no idea what it's going to cover or what games are going to talk about but you know you can
5602900	5608660	assume uh new games and all their big sports franchises that's for sure um probably an update
5608660	5612900	on dragon age quite frankly I think it's a high time to get some more on that maybe that'll
5612900	5618420	actually be a thing this year I don't know um but regardless uh there's going to be a part of me
5618420	5621620	that's skeptical about everything they announce because I'm going to be like oh is it really ready
5621620	5625700	or are they just going to put it out uh before it's done um but we'll see we can make our own
5625700	5633300	judgments in July all right let's let's go back to a simpler time you guys let's take a step back
5633300	5638980	and we're going to visit you know this is a time when you had to get it right the first time because
5638980	5644100	your game was burned to a cartridge and unable to be patched really until years and years and
5644100	5648180	years later now we have that technology but not back then uh it's the classic game of the week
5648180	5653060	and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids
5653060	5659860	should be checking this game out uh and this this I gotta say dark soccer it's I did I didn't know
5659860	5664900	this game that you picked tonight this is a pretty obscure one for me maybe I did I just picked
5664900	5671940	something that people might not have heard of um it's not even like the best game but it's it's
5671940	5676900	neat I'll say it's it's different it's different so anyway but please let's get to it so the classic
5676900	5682660	game of the week is called Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch um because there's an ellipsis so I had
5682660	5691700	to pause so at any rate um it is a video game that came out for game boy and the SNES in 1993
5692500	5699060	um it actually is another one of those games that didn't come out in Japan it's a side-scrolling
5699060	5704740	platform game about a French chef collecting ingredients for his dishes by going to different
5704740	5711940	countries to catch them since they have escaped um I'll go into other editions of that but it came
5711940	5722340	out in November 1993 in the U.S. and September 93 in Europe so it was uh European first um and
5722340	5730900	I don't think we got the game boy version in the U.S. we uh I think it was only um only in Europe
5732020	5741460	but um in 1994 it did get a release on the Amiga and the Amiga CD32 so it's it's kind of a
5742580	5750740	who who knows these games right um so at any rate um there is a single-player mode and a two-player
5750740	5758100	alternating mode so either way you play as Pierre Le Chef and you have to capture a certain number
5758100	5763860	of your ingredients before your time runs out so kind of like a little bubble bobbly you know
5764740	5770980	um the way that the levels are set up so you know you jump from platforms around and you have to
5771620	5777940	capture everything and you know you've got some you know you have basically you can set them on
5777940	5785940	fire too which is pretty fun um anyway though uh you uh you have to catch them in a net and
5785940	5791860	put them into a cage in the level and then in every level though you have to find the net
5791860	5796980	first before you can catch something so once you have all of your ingredients then you get a door
5796980	5806900	that pops up to the next level you will encounter some baddies including germs and bacteria where
5806900	5812500	if you get touched by them you lose your life the bacteria can also turn your ingredients into
5812500	5822500	hostile enemies so you have to watch out for spoiled food hehe and then there's also the
5822740	5831060	uh arch nemesis chef chef le noir um who will uh show up to hinder your process
5831860	5838500	um you can also get weapons like uh hot sauce and bags of flour you can use to
5839140	5845220	stun your ingredients and the bacteria so you have to basically take him all the way
5845220	5851700	through uh various places um Switzerland Greece Jamaica of course in this game is known as West
5851700	5859300	Indies um Mexico China and then France you have eight levels you have to navigate through in each
5859300	5864580	country and at the end of each country you can play a bonus game where you can get more points
5864580	5869700	for extra lives so once you lose all your lives or complete the game then you're given a final
5869700	5874980	scorecard that says how many points you got throughout the game and then you get a high
5874980	5885060	square ranking so there's not much out for like big reviews on this one um like uh game rankings
5885060	5895700	gave this a 59.5 um but you know it's cute and I thought you know as much as we love our our bubble
5895700	5901780	bobbles and various games as such this really makes me think of it but like a little bit of
5901860	5908020	mappy thrown in and just I mean it's a fun little unique platformer I thought
5908820	5917060	um and and again it's one of those games that had the distinction of being a fully uh western
5917060	5924100	release the music was giving me um adventure island vibes too kind of yeah yeah apparently
5924100	5930900	the um Amiga CD 32 version looks really good but I mean I think we're looking at the SNES version
5930900	5937460	we are yeah and it's don't look half bad it looks like early SNES you know because it kind of is
5937460	5941700	but it kind of looks like a port of an Amiga game which is what I find interesting about
5941700	5946820	this selection is that there weren't a ton of Super Nintendo games like this but um ironically
5946820	5951220	one you've picked recently Lost Vikings is another one that gives me that vibe where you can kind of
5951220	5957220	tell it's a computer game ported for the Super Nintendo um SimCity is strangely an example of
5957220	5964260	that but not not as much because SimCity had that Nintendo flair thrown in as well um but anyhow I
5964260	5969460	digress well another one about this is that the company Mindscape uh actually started off as an
5969460	5979140	American company and then uh was acquired by a French owner so it's now um located in uh
5979940	5987940	um it so it's a French this game is actually a French developed uh uh game they did like the
5988660	5995380	the MacVenture series Moonstone uh Warhammer Shadow of the Horned Rat a few a few uh
5995380	6001540	Warhammer and Lego Island so it's pretty it's just pretty interesting you know I
6003140	6008340	it's something that I've noticed though is that European developed games in general like during
6008340	6015860	the 16-bit era had the same kind of look and feel for the most part maybe that's what it is
6015860	6021700	it's not so much a PC you know equivalent or Amiga equivalent um but it's the European well
6021700	6027300	Commodore was so huge in Europe that an Amiga port almost kind of goes hand in hand anyway I
6027300	6031860	digress again sorry but I was just thinking maybe this is more like you can just kind of tell it's a
6031860	6037780	Europe uh kind of developed game well my other thing too is that you know the only thing that
6037780	6041460	doesn't make this distinctly European is that there's no dropping water to kill you
6044820	6052100	but anyway um so yeah it's a cute game um like the again you'll see it as out to lunch but the
6052100	6058340	full name of it is Pierre Le Chef is out to lunch I wonder does anybody in chat have memories of
6058340	6062180	this game because you know I did not know this game but when I was looking for the video the
6062180	6066180	b-roll of it and yeah you'll have a easier time kind of finding information on it if you look
6066180	6071540	for out to lunch as opposed to the full name um but uh I saw like a lot of YouTube comments that
6071540	6076580	were like oh I love this game when I was a kid or this you know so even if something has a low
6076580	6081300	you know Metacritic score or whatever there's just certain games that are always going to take us
6081300	6086420	back you know like there are games that didn't review well on Metacritic that I love um the NES
6086420	6092900	port of Ultima Exodus is a great example um it doesn't review well at all but I have huge memories
6092900	6099540	of that game there's always gonna be a special place friend who had this oh cute and we would we
6099540	6104580	would do the the two-player mode I mean I really didn't play it a whole lot but I had seen this pop
6104580	6112100	up not too terribly long ago and I was like oh that game was cute I sucked at it um and so I decided
6112100	6119780	to throw it in because it's you know the the Nintendo library in and of itself for Super
6119860	6127060	Nintendo is bigger than you think it is oh yeah um and I like to find just these little things that
6127060	6134580	might have flown under your own radar and say hey you know yeah bust out that retron or or the 400
6134580	6141220	you might have paid for the analog um a bobby black wolf is in chat and being a little bit
6141220	6147140	tongue-in-cheek or sassy asking some questions here such as it says I have questions such as
6147140	6151700	what causes these foods to escape why are we only sending a chef after these sentient foods
6151700	6156580	what happens if these escaped foods spend too much time in the sun and why do we not air drop
6156580	6160660	the chef into this war zone without a net is it Billy Mitchell hot sauce I think talking about
6160660	6166020	one of the foods there does it's on-site requisition and what does the BurgerTime
6166020	6170500	universe think of this development of more sentient foods that's it's it's hard to not
6170500	6175860	make the BurgerTime comparison when looking at this game about you know chef fighting bad food
6175860	6179940	for sure you know you know what I think of every time I see the little eggs rolling is I think of
6179940	6187060	weebl and bob remember back when I used to do the website of the month oh yeah that was back in the
6187060	6194420	day that was before your little uh facts you had the facts on the early days of the podcast
6194420	6198900	I don't know if that was a life lesson or whatever that was yeah yeah maybe I should start giving out
6198900	6204900	life advice again but this time I should charge for it um but but anyway I okay so the big rocks
6204900	6210020	are truffles this is definitely a French game anyway um they look like rocks but I always just
6210020	6214900	call them rocks like why is it eating rocks but they're truffles um but the eggs make me think
6214900	6220020	of weebl and bob which I did review the uh the website and actually one of the the folks that
6220020	6228500	works on it you know reached out to to us so um but yeah the eggs make me think of uh of bob rolling
6228580	6235780	in little nice all right so there it is your classic game of the week out to lunch or um
6235780	6242980	the full name one more time um Pierre le chef is out to lunch all right thank you very much great
6242980	6248100	pick all right it's fun to learn about new games sometimes too even years and years after the fact
6248100	6254340	all right yeah the truffle also kind of looks like a big poo all right let's uh travel around the
6254340	6258980	world and quickly check out some rapid fire news and some quick headlines loki will start with you
6259860	6266660	yeah so as you can see in my background here um ghoul patrol and zombies ate me neighbors uh that's
6266660	6273220	a brand new uh collection that's going to be released now on uh playstation 4 xbox one switch
6273220	6282180	and pc june 29th coming thanks to uh limited run games um they're also going to be doing a uh
6283140	6289620	physical version of that a little bit later on as well um if you can find that and then um yeah so
6289620	6295620	it's going to be coming with the two games so one of which i've only played i don't know too much
6295620	6300660	about google patrol other than it looks kind of similar um they're also adding art collection
6300660	6305780	soundtrack developer interviews and plus they're going to have trophies and achievements and stuff
6305780	6312500	like that local co-op so uh 14.99 is what that's gonna run you so it looks awesome can't wait to
6312500	6317140	get that a nice surprise because these are really some cult fate like the zombies ate my neighbors
6317140	6321380	is like a cult favorite i'm sure dark soccer picked it as a classic game at one point because
6321380	6326340	it's or maybe you did when she wasn't here one week but but uh it's really a cult favorite of
6326340	6330180	uh type of game and uh it's great to see it getting a re-release and some attention again
6330580	6337380	yeah and so there's always been a lot of uh rom hacks out there and one the more um i guess
6337380	6342980	popular ones for uh smash is smash remix which is the rom hack of the original smash brothers game
6342980	6349140	for the nintendo 64 um they've added lots of new characters to the game and the latest character
6349140	6357140	that they added in there is conquer from conqueror's bad fur day also they have um looks like
6357860	6362980	wolf O'Donnell is also in there as well so uh pretty cool to see that in the newest update
6362980	6368980	but yeah it's kind of funny seeing conquer with a chainsaw in a smash brothers game but
6368980	6373060	i would i would do down for seeing that in a uh modern smash game as well
6374740	6381620	all right dark soccer what do you have for us well um you know evercade is a cool little
6381620	6389780	device and their uh their launch lineup has a few people scratching their heads um so of course
6389780	6398500	they have some traditional stuff like namco museum coming out um but other two that have been listed
6398500	6407700	recently the uh jalico collection one and the pico collection two um they are pretty classic
6407700	6413220	but i think you have to kind of stop and think about what you might have played in those series
6413220	6418500	like for example the uh the jalico one has the original earth defense force unrelated to the
6418500	6425700	current ones base is loaded a styonax city connection rival turf um and then the pico
6425700	6435060	one has things like soccer kid and shut up and jam so it's it's got some craziness on there so
6435060	6444500	if you like those family of games and certainly check it out and then uh sony has new uh ps5
6444500	6452340	dual sense controllers that they have announced a fied um and i just made up that word so you can
6452340	6460660	get uh these galaxy inspired colors one of them is midnight black and cosmic red and honestly
6461300	6465460	they both look pretty sweet although the red one kind of looks like a bathing suit i just bought
6466180	6475380	um but uh the uh the midnight black will be 70 and the cosmic red will be 75 i mean maybe
6475380	6481860	red costs more or something i guess it's that red dye but it's it's damn it's gorgeous so don't lick
6481860	6490100	it yeah yeah but at any rate you know um if you want a little bit more flair to your non-existent
6490100	6496020	ps5 there you go all right all right now we're going to take a look around the world at some
6496020	6500820	games you'll be able to play on those pretty new 70 controllers or 70 plus i should say
6500820	6506580	uh starting in the us loki yeah so we have a game called archaea which is coming out on nintendo
6506580	6514580	switch uh days gone on pc there's another one of those uh sony titles for you uh leisure suit larry
6514580	6520340	wet dreams dry twice i don't know why that series is still around why are they still making those
6520340	6525700	games i don't know and then to the switch playstation 4 and xbox one uh snow runner
6525700	6532740	on nintendo switch void terrarium plus on playstation 5 akiba's trip hellbound and
6532740	6540900	debriefed on nintendo switch and playstation 4 and jonique luminaries that's on an antenna switch
6541860	6549860	layers of fear 2 on nintendo switch manifold garden on playstation 5 ruin factory 5 on nintendo
6549860	6556820	switch just die already on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 and xbox one what a pleasant
6556820	6565700	sounding title exactly it's awesome um we've got uncharted waters 4 with power up kit hd version
6565700	6572820	that's quite the name on pc and nintendo switch uh knockout city on pc nintendo switch playstation
6572820	6582500	4 playstation 5 xbox one xbox series x me topia on nintendo switch rust on playstation 4 and xbox
6582500	6587620	one and that's it all right wow busy week uh bobby black will respond to my question why are they
6587620	6592420	still making these games saying people buy them regarding allison do they though because doesn't
6592420	6597220	this i i could be completely wrong but doesn't this franchise keep changing hands because like
6597220	6602420	is sold to the lowest bidder because like all these games are turd sure i don't know if it's
6602420	6606900	this one or like the last one but one of these was a kickstarter i think this may have been that
6606900	6613540	kickstarter game oh okay i got it all right all right let's go over to japan and check out some
6613540	6617540	releases over there uh it's it's getting busy i know golden week was a couple weeks ago we had a
6617540	6621700	kind of slow week after that but it's it's picking back up again so here we go on the switch this
6621700	6628100	week in japan rune factory 5 regular and limited edition angelique luminous luminarize uh in a
6628100	6633540	regular and limited edition as well uh akiba's trip hellbound and debriefed in a regular and
6633540	6639060	10th anniversary limited edition uh the wanderer frankenstein's creature in a regular and special
6639060	6644740	edition uh and then manifold garden also out on the switch uncharted waters 4 there's some type
6644740	6650260	of power-up kit that comes with this uh there's a regular hd version and the 30th anniversary
6650260	6656180	edition that comes with this as well i'm assuming the power-up kit must be an online thing um
6656180	6660500	because it doesn't look like it's a like some of the peripheral in the box or anything like that
6661140	6666180	yeah it looks it looks a little bit like a nobunaga type of game but i could i could be
6666180	6669700	completely missing the mark there i'm seriously looking at just a couple screenshots here it's a
6669700	6674340	koi tecmo game though so uh and they are the ones with uh nobunaga's ambition so i wouldn't be
6674340	6682820	surprised if it's um related um let's see also on the switch this week we have um that's it let
6682820	6687620	me go to the playstation 5 and 4 and check out releases there mortal shell is out this week in
6687620	6693140	japan on the playstation 5 and that's it that's the big release on the ps5 this week uh probably
6693140	6696820	a little more on the playstation 4 i imagine you'll see a lot of those same twitch switch
6697780	6704660	switch titles yes akiba's trip is out uh there as well and the ninja jaja maru collection
6704660	6710420	is out uh this week on the playstation 4 as well i'm trying to see what collection this is oh this
6710420	6717460	is some old school arcade games oh and nes games wow um i'm trying to figure out if these games
6717460	6721620	were ever released in the states and what they're called it's a bunch of old famicom games and they
6721620	6727300	even have a new one in it um chad if you guys know feel free to help me out i'm trying to look
6727300	6738260	at screenshots to see if i recognize it i oh um is it kid nikki is it that kid kid nikki the
6738260	6743060	mystical ninja i could be totally wrong on that somebody else might know it's kind of what i'm
6743860	6752660	drawn to at first though yeah um a kid nikki uh was i won this it was actually a different game
6752660	6760500	it was called uh the wonderful yamcha uh yamcha maru oh okay my bad so it wasn't a going on game
6760500	6765140	okay uh oh no i know it wasn't going on game uh dark tatsuya says i think it was japan only okay
6765140	6774980	fair enough all right um let's move on uh to the uk dark sakura six things on the 18th is snow
6774980	6782180	runner for switch on switch and playstation also on the 18th is leisure suit larry wet dreams die

6794820	6799940	console edition and on the 21st again on switch me topia
6802420	6807780	yay a lot of people looking forward to that one yeah but i just like i kind of like wasn't
6807780	6812900	expecting that because i you know hadn't really been looking too much at the uh some of the
6812900	6820660	upcoming switch releases um but what what decade did or what year did i pop back into
6820660	6825940	where we have leisure suit larry and me topia well if you go back to the way way back uh the
6825940	6831140	original leader suit larry i'm pretty sure was in early 90s maybe even late 80s type of thing
6831140	6839700	uh and um yeah uh uh the other is a little more recent yeah yeah oh this game's bobby
6839700	6844980	blackpool's reminding i enjoyed me toby on 3ds dark soccer was the big baddie in my game because
6844980	6849540	you could you could make your friends the um monsters and i seem to remember a conversation
6849540	6857380	at e3 or something about this and you ended up being the daddy yeah that's great all right uh
6857380	6863380	let's move on then we have some more news this first story is is interesting to me but loki
6863380	6871540	i'll let you talk about it here yeah so sega i guess uh part of their latest financial results
6871540	6878340	report they had sort of i guess realized that hey they've got a bunch of these really recognizable
6878340	6885780	ip's that they've been sitting on forever that um perhaps they could remaster remake or reboot them
6885780	6892420	um they were listing off um you know some examples like crazy taxi jet set radio
6892980	6899620	uh space channel five rez panther dragon knights shinobi virtue fighter altered beast house of the
6899620	6906820	dead serisa rage soul hackers etc um basically saying that you know after careful examination
6906820	6914260	you know we can remade re-release these perhaps people would want to buy our popular games
6914260	6919220	well they have re-released a lot of those um yeah i understand that but like yeah alan get
6919220	6924180	to give alan a cheap plug he plays a lot of those games on his uh stream on the music mondays that
6924180	6930020	he does he i know he's played through space channel five part two uh and uh rez he's done before jet
6930020	6935700	set radio so like you know they have re-released those two games on steam but how do you not
6935700	6942340	realize like hey maybe this is a good idea like it seems very obvious to me i don't know oh
6942420	6947540	i'm sure go on twitter and i'm sure there are plenty of people that are saying who do i have to
6947540	6952100	bang in the parking lot to get a new jet set radio there's a lot of people that would love love love
6952100	6957620	to see that so um i hope so i'd love to see a new space channel five to be fair we did get the vr
6957620	6962660	thing um but i just haven't gotten around to playing the vr thing yet but i know i know there
6962660	6966500	is that so at least we know it's not forgotten forgotten but yeah i think i think a lot of us
6966500	6971140	would like to see uh you know some of these old sega classics make a resurgence uh pod culture
6971140	6977220	and chat uh quite loudly says just do a damn dreamcast mini ffs we all know what that means
6977220	6980980	so yeah i think there's a lot of people that would be very excited about that but it has to have the
6980980	6987860	little the little um thing the tamagotchi thing you take with the vmu thank you uh that you take
6987860	6995220	with you so all right uh dart to see you in chat says i know people beg hadeke nagah numa uh for
6995220	6999460	a new one but he just redirects them to sega i mean what's he gonna do about a new jet set radio
6999460	7008900	that's right yeah yeah go to sega all right more spiritual successors yeah um going on to the next
7008900	7012980	story which i think this is really cool and i talked earlier about like you know hey more
7012980	7018980	accessibility type of things is awesome and i i love this uh microsoft is talking about something
7018980	7026500	they are working on with speech transcription and text-to-speech synthesis for party chat
7026500	7031140	so xbox insiders actually have access to this which i i think i'm one of those so i need to
7031140	7035940	go look and see if i have access to this even though i i hardly ever talk with people on xbox
7035940	7040900	i don't know what i'd use it on um but maybe it would work on pc uh presumably i don't know but
7040900	7046260	anyway i think this is great uh so this feature is going to make it easier for people who maybe
7046260	7051140	you know have hearing or speech difficulties they can actually read what's coming up in party chat
7051140	7057060	because it's being live transcribed on the screen uh these features are in the ease of access tab
7057060	7062580	under game and chat transcription uh with this on words spoken in a party are converted to text
7062580	7067700	displayed in an adjustable overlay uh and if you have text-to-speech enabled anything you type in
7067700	7073300	party text chat will be read by a synthetic voice to the rest of the party so it's a way for you to
7073300	7079460	have a speaking voice as well if you want um so that's really cool and uh a feature i'd like to
7080100	7085460	play around with i love that i would love to have transcriptions of this podcast available
7085460	7091620	unfortunately the reality is all the services that offer it um are way too expensive like you know
7091620	7096020	and i get you know people don't do work for free so it has to and all these services i'm looking
7096020	7102180	at are actual people working so i get it but the problem is um a three hour or you know at worse
7102180	7107060	maybe two and a half two hour whenever on some weeks this podcast like it's really expensive so
7107060	7111380	i just i can't afford it but if there were some type of like automated way to do it which somebody
7111380	7117140	was telling me to use youtube to do the transcriptions and um i it's not youtube isn't
7117140	7123940	great at it but it might be a start um so yeah i i would love to have that um just even for this
7123940	7129860	show check on some options yeah that'd be cool just if it costs money the answer's no all right
7129860	7138260	the answer might be maybe all right um depends on who's fronting it yeah so um all right let's move
7138260	7144660	on uh i think this one's two years dark talker yeah i was just about to start it now this is
7144660	7154100	already passed so this was actually for friday uh may 14th um itch.io uh held its first ever creator
7154100	7162420	day which i don't know how that went um but they were they went to forego its usual cut of sales
7162420	7168820	um so a hundred percent of any transactions that day after taxes and payment processing fees
7168820	7178340	were going directly back to the creators so basically it was a good way to to put these
7178340	7182740	indie developers give them a little bit more money in their pocket i mean and the thing with
7182740	7190500	um with itch.io already is that they have a default 10 cut of sales but it could go
7190500	7197140	between zero and 100 depending on what the developer wanted to do um and so they take a
7197140	7204180	much smaller cut than the 30 industry standard um so i thought it was really cool that you know
7204180	7211220	they gave back yeah i was gonna say i'd known about it i know i wish i'd known we would have
7211220	7216340	hyped your game more to get uh sold then but uh s is showing her matt does remind us in chat
7216340	7222020	speaking of itch.io loki's game is on it and drops the link there to uh buy pixel poops number two
7222020	7227620	i appreciate that and i sold uh just reordered my labels because they got screwed up the first time
7227620	7233220	so still working on that physical edition all right nice all right well maybe we'll do another
7233220	7238980	one of those uh creators day again uh in the future that would sure be nice all right meanwhile loki
7239380	7245780	all right so um you know this is kind of funny because it's almost like a meme here but
7245780	7251780	uh we we remember the ever given container ship on the suis canal well apparently uh
7251780	7258420	nintendo's switch shipments were impacted by that now i might say though that's a likely story
7258420	7263860	nintendo that your your shipments were this is the reason why there's a shortage on your consoles
7264660	7272980	right it's because of this um i'm skeptical if you may say um but apparently they said yes that
7272980	7279460	that caused delays for the product in europe and some of the uh inventories are a little bit tighter
7279460	7288580	in those countries sure sure nintendo we'll believe you this time but i'm skeptical i'm on to you
7288580	7295540	you think it's just a convenient excuse i'm sure that they'll say that the ever given like the
7295540	7299780	digital version of the ever given is just like it's just jammed into the e-shop that's why we
7299780	7304340	got to take down mario you know in march because it's just that mario games just can't get through
7304340	7311620	there so i don't know i don't i'll believe them this time uh bobby blackwolf in chat says remember
7311620	7316020	that ship didn't just block its own stuff it blocked all ships yes it wasn't just about the
7316020	7321620	one ship that was stuck but obviously it caused a traffic jam uh but like the worst possible kind
7321620	7328820	that went on for weeks really um no so yeah it's just like nintendo always has hardware shortages
7328820	7334100	on everything so this doesn't help but i think what i think when it happened we all sat here
7334100	7340660	going it's not going to help you know so right yeah there is that all right um let's move on
7340660	7346660	and uh get to our last story tonight which is rumor-based but these are rumors that are
7347540	7354820	gaining a lot of steam so you know take for it what it is they're rumors um but anyway uh so
7354820	7359780	there's uh this blogger out there zippo that i guess has got some things right before and
7359780	7364740	it's kind of talking about what nintendo is doing for the rest of the year um and i guess based on
7364740	7368740	his track record some people are kind of you know running with it a little bit so what is it that
7368740	7371700	he's talking about for the rest of the year and this isn't the first time i've heard of this
7371700	7376420	apparently a 2d metroid is something that's being worked on and that apparently it's it's done and
7376420	7381300	it's ready to go um so that would be something if we got that really soon you know i love mesa
7381300	7387460	metroid apparently runs at 60 frames a second but you know as i would encourage everyone else to do
7387460	7391860	don't set the bar high with this stuff i'm not gonna okay i'd love this but i'm not going to
7391860	7398500	assume it's happening metroid prime 4 is happening nintendo's confirmed that someday apparently a
7398500	7404340	donkey kong game from the folks behind mario odyssey is being made it is uh like a 2.5 d type
7404340	7409620	of game sounds a lot like like the tropical freeze type of thing uh it could be very interesting so
7409620	7415460	that is something that's being worked on as well as a new fire emblem super mario party 2 more 99
7415460	7422900	games uh and um apparently and what i think is interesting about this rumor and one reason why
7422900	7428420	i'm willing to kind of believe it a little more than others is that they go as far to say zelda
7429220	7434100	2 not this year so i think that's interesting that they're actually kind of placing the bet
7434100	7439460	there that that isn't happening this year uh and the reason why uh issues uh raised from the
7439460	7445300	pandemic it's almost complete but the end of the year doesn't seem feasible but it seems plausible
7445300	7449780	if we want to go back to that word uh that nintendo could announce uh that it would be like
7449780	7455620	a spring type of game so maybe the same release time frame as say animal crossing since clearly
7455620	7460260	they can put out a new zelda whenever they want they don't have to do it for the holidays uh they
7460260	7464980	could do it whenever they want and it'll still sell like crazy and then of course a big one the
7464980	7469300	new mario kart game there is a new mario kart game that's being worked on as well however it
7469300	7476180	may not be mario kart 9 um and the the blogger here doesn't know if it's maybe a mario kart 9
7476180	7481620	or if it's nintendo kart or maybe an expansion for 8 or something so like isn't willing to kind
7481620	7486740	of place stock in any of those but that there is a new mario kart in development and that that
7486740	7491540	is coming at some point so you know this is what people are talking about on twitter and things
7491540	7500180	like that uh certainly a list like that it's it seems believable enough but again i'm not
7500180	7506820	going to place bets on anything who who called the game builder garage thing nobody so that came out
7506820	7512020	of left field so i think there's also a lot of there could be unexpected stuff as well and there
7512020	7517460	are some things in there that are kind of safe bets again we've heard the 2d metroid thing before
7517460	7522340	uh to say breath of the wild 2 isn't going to make it because of covid um isn't that big a stretch i
7522340	7528740	know i said but it's not that big a stretch um a new mario party and a new mario kart of course
7528740	7533540	you know even though nintendo killed mario some of his franchises are still popular and so they
7533540	7541300	will weekend at bernie's him through some more games uh to make the money so uh tiger class says
7541300	7546100	would that world circuit be considered mario kart 9 because there's jokes that's joe 100 matt saying
7546100	7551700	mario kart 10 they're skipping the nine uh i i mean they could do anything they want you know the
7551700	7556740	the blogger said what about nintendo kart it doesn't even necessarily need to be a mario kart
7556740	7562980	what if it's super smash kart i don't know like but i could see that maybe nintendo wants to go
7562980	7568020	beyond just mario i don't know we'll see we'll see um but i think it will be mario kart 9 or
7568020	7575940	it'll be i don't want to say a reboot but it'll be like a re like it'll be a mario kart's world
7575940	7581140	or mario kart's universe or mario kart like they'll give it a new subtitle that kind of takes
7581140	7587860	it away from the other sequel games we'll see oh and uh the folks are talking about the home circuit
7587860	7591940	yeah home circuit was like a spin-off it was a different thing that's a good call out because
7591940	7596580	that was a good example of something different that wasn't in the mainline games no that was not
7596580	7603540	canonically mario kart 9 um but good call yeah that that was short-lived in my household too
7603540	7612500	yeah yeah i mean i i'm i'm no more physical things from nintendo anymore i'm not purchasing anything
7612500	7617620	that has a physical device because it's just not going to get used ever whether that be labo or
7617620	7623540	the mario kart thing it's just it's not worth it boy we're making a lot of big statements tonight
7625700	7630580	all right let's get to our listener round table if you have some comments you'd like us to discuss
7630580	7636260	in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network we can certainly get into those um and
7636260	7641060	then of course we want to check our emails you guys email us every week over at participate
7641060	7646100	at orange longtrady.com and dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and get some emails uh
7646100	7652420	for us no i'm not oh are there none tonight nothing boo yes we have no bananas and i don't
7652420	7655860	even think i have really anything on drag race there's literally nothing to discuss i'm not
7655860	7664020	watching the drag race down under so now what happens oh okay i'm laughing i have no tea to
7664020	7668820	spill so okay i will get to the discord comments but i have to get to this this is making me laugh
7668820	7676660	as 100 mad is asking so rob how does it feel to go viral this week i finally after years and years
7676660	7682180	on twitter had a tweet that ended up getting like a thousand plus likes on it so i'd say it went
7682180	7687380	pretty viral even though when i told alan about it he was like well a viral tweet would be like
7687380	7696740	20 000 likes and it was it wasn't even it's weird that's the interesting thing about what tweets
7696740	7702980	hit is that i've had some tweets that are pretty fucking funny that don't go anywhere people don't
7702980	7708100	retweet them i might get 40 or 50 likes from my followers but it doesn't get retweeted or anything
7708100	7711700	so it doesn't really go and that's fine that's okay but like the tweet i wrote that went viral
7711700	7716340	so what it was it was a play on this whole there was some dumb magazine or something that had a
7716340	7723060	feature that was talking about geriatric millennials in the office place that apparently they're now
7723060	7726100	leading tea i don't even know what the article was about i didn't want to link it because i
7726100	7730100	didn't want to give it the hits but everybody on twitter of course is dunking on this term
7730100	7736580	geriatric millennials i think loki would qualify as one with his age yeah but dark soccer and i
7736580	7741620	what the fuck does that make us we're technically gen x at that point not even a millennial though
7741620	7749380	because i'm 1980s so okay so you're like right at the end there so so i i just that would make you
7749380	7754900	gen y i just i just made this sassy tweet and i found um a picture of a skeleton at a computer
7754900	7761460	and i put me i put me born in 1978 reading about geriatric millennials that tweet got fucking like
7761460	7767220	a thousand likes on it and like a hundred retweets so it's it's weird is the answer to that matt i
7767220	7771620	mean i'm just laughing at it because like it's always the stupid tweets that go viral um the
7771620	7778020	closest i ever got before was um like i think i think i got 300 or 400 likes on a tweet that was
7778020	7784260	using the hashtag um national send a nude day and it was just like a gif of judge judy and i just
7784260	7789860	put times almost up national send a new and i got like 400 likes it was a gif of judge judy banging
7789860	7796580	the desk going hurry up like it was stupid like i wish one of my tweets about video games would get
7796580	7803220	or a tweet promoting the show but we all the the reality is twitter doesn't do that all right anyway
7804260	7811300	they haven't found our show by now i i know it's a lost cause at this point um all right so there
7811300	7817220	there's my answer to your question in chat as to another man all right uh going to discord um i've
7817220	7821540	been uh starting to read discord comments you guys leave throughout the week over at vog network dot
7821540	7826420	com slash discord in the orange lounge radio channel and uh thank you tiger klai so you posted
7826420	7832260	that a movie i talked about at the top of the show so appreciate that um interesting a tweet from
7832260	7838980	corkay in our uh orange lounge radio channel that um blizzard is relenting on the uh cloning fees
7839060	7844020	i didn't even know they were doing this they were gonna charge 35 dollars to duplicate your
7844020	7849220	character holy fuck i thought that was something they were doing for free well apparently they've
7849220	7858500	retreated 20 worth so now that cloning feature is gonna cost 15 dollars woohoo i guess thanks
7858500	7865140	thanks for that hell uh dark sakura uh tiger claw reminded me of this in our discord did you see
7865140	7870020	this week the mass effect video that had all the fans talking about what the series means to them
7870020	7875140	and all that cute stuff all the like cosplayers and stuff you should go check it out uh tiger
7875140	7879460	claw linked it in our discord so be sure to check that out vog network dot com slash discord new
7879460	7886580	orange channel at the one minute and 44 second mark our friend travis donovan is in it um he
7886580	7892100	doesn't say anything but it's his uh when he renewed his wedding vows at dragon con and he
7892100	7897060	was dressed us up as shepherd and jenna was dressed up as miranda it's it there's it's really
7897060	7902020	quick it's like them embracing after saying i do but uh that was the thing so it's it's actually
7902020	7907300	in the video that's really cool so that's sweet yeah it was i i and uh you know when they uh
7907300	7911060	when that part came up it was like i know them i know them actually and actually that wasn't
7911060	7916420	the only person i had a twitter uh mutual that was in the video a little more featured talking about
7916420	7922420	um like the gay representation in mass effect and what it meant to him so um there's a lot of
7923140	7928660	a lot of like wow this is a small world i almost feel guilty for going off earlier but i don't
7928660	7932740	i mean like you can love a game and still be pissed off that it's not given the love and
7932740	7941700	affection it deserves we it's that's what it is we protect we we protect our babies uh and that's
7941700	7948340	that's what it is when it comes to mass effect all right um let's see oh tiger claws link reminds me
7948340	7953300	of this did you guys see loki you had to have seen this all the hubba balloon around the calculator
7953300	7959620	game on nintendo switch have you seen this i saw that they had like a calculator app yeah and it
7959620	7965060	looks exactly like the iphone calculator like right on down to the colors but it's like a
7965060	7970500	scientific calculator going for 10 bucks but internet gonna internet this is like the whole
7970500	7975860	like rage like oh man this calculator is the best thing ever it does everything it says it's gonna
7975860	7983140	do it's so powerful and it's like i don't know why this is becoming a meme but internet what can you
7983140	7988340	say they have like like there's like art programs and stuff on there as well like nobody's making a
7988340	7994180	big deal about that i guess it's just silly that calculator's on there yeah whatever you know um
7994180	7999860	act deft asking the real questions can that calculator run doom um i don't think so because
7999860	8006020	it doesn't have that kind of screen on it but but never say never act deft um w04 in chat asks
8006020	8011620	what are the chances of a new maximum carnage video game now that the new venom movie is coming out
8011620	8018180	um i mean as good as anything else uh but usually like i feel like they haven't like the marvel
8018740	8023620	and even dc stuff they haven't really been doing a lot of like this is something the industry used
8023620	8028180	to do that they don't do as much anymore they haven't done a lot of stuff directly from like
8028900	8034740	current movies it's like the avengers exists in its own universe in the games now and it's not
8034740	8040260	just a port of the movies right some spider-man skins maybe and that's about it yeah that's
8040900	8048980	probably it but again never say never all right um let's see never ever never ever sj100 matt and
8048980	8053380	discord with a big headline we didn't get to tonight uh bobby talked about it a little more
8053380	8061140	on his show but it's the whole hubble about starfield from bethesda is going to be exclusive
8061140	8067220	to xbox and pc uh originally uh it was thought that this game was going to be exclusive to sony
8067220	8072660	but is anyone surprised that microsoft bought bethesda and now this game is going to be
8072660	8077460	exclusive it'll probably be just like a timed exclusive maybe well i don't know if it's gonna
8077460	8083940	be a complete exclusive i want some of that money it is suggesting that it is a complete exclusive
8083940	8091700	and it's going to show up at this e3 and it will release in 2022 nice so uh we'll see hope it
8091700	8098100	doesn't suck i'm more interested in the uh new uh sky or new skyrim new elder scrolls game whenever
8098100	8104180	that comes out yeah all right um i think uh let me see if i can get through a couple more of these
8104180	8107620	but first let me go to uh loki and get some last minute stories and then i'll do a couple more
8107620	8113780	discard discord yeah i don't got any of those what all right um looked there wasn't really anything
8113780	8119780	worth covering i'm sorry i want to say marcus in our discord uh shared that article about the ps2
8119780	8124420	exploit that talks about uh certain versions of the system being region free you have to scroll
8124420	8128260	up a bit because he posted it on may 10th but i know that came up on a previous episode of the
8128260	8136420	show um so there is that um going back okay well here i got something um so ebay is banning the
8136420	8143700	sale of adult video games so they're going to be implementing a new adult items policy on june 15th
8144260	8151460	and they're going to be you know blocking anything that's basically unrated you know triple x x um
8151460	8160260	also explicit uh comics books films animation manga hentai yaoi um i don't know if it that
8160260	8166900	necessarily applies to video games though but maybe if it's unrated so sorry no bmx triple x
8166900	8171300	uh used or i guess you're not gonna find that anymore you have to go to the facebook marketplace
8171300	8175540	for that we have to steal it online like a lot of people do these days not that you should do that
8175540	8179940	now you should do that but sometimes when it comes to games preservation we're left with minimal
8179940	8185060	choices all right i want to mention this in chat so bobby blackwolf in chat is talking about this
8185060	8190660	and dark soccer this is up your alley um literally in a way uh was this was there something earlier
8190660	8195860	about mandalorian pinball no i didn't bring it up because you did bobby so we we don't always
8195860	8200580	have to talk about the same things but uh dark soccer of course is a pinball geek so i think
8200580	8205140	the world wants to know her reactions you're not getting it bobby is so you can fly to atlanta and
8205220	8210980	play to his house there's already a bunch of people who are like selling their pre-orders
8210980	8215700	on ebay that well it's probably because there's the whole like three editions right you talked
8215700	8219140	about a black knight table recently that had this whole thing there's like a limited edition
8219140	8225140	a extra edition the same thing's going on with the mandalorian yeah well the thing the the big thing
8225140	8232900	is is that we just got a new to us uh pinball anyway we have uh the jersey jack guns and roses
8233460	8238980	oh cool yeah it's really cool i actually i actually kind of like it i want to come over
8238980	8244980	and play pinball come over yay all right let's play come over tomorrow uh maybe
8244980	8251140	don't you stream on mondays no alan's yes oh i actually stream on mondays earlier
8251780	8259380	oh well yeah after the show and all that but yeah yeah all right after what show the the one we're
8259380	8264180	on tomorrow oh tomorrow well i thought i thought i'd do tonight i do monday and i do tuesday
8264180	8270500	okay all right i'm so confused all right uh at some point it doesn't have to be tomorrow
8270500	8277060	just whenever uh come over and play pinball um and then in in uh september hopefully uh enough
8277060	8283300	people get vaccinated where dragon con can be a thing and uh even if it's a little even if it's
8283300	8287060	a downscaled show this year which i'm expecting that might be the case they'll probably still
8287060	8291300	have dragon con but they're probably going to do some things to try to not have people gather
8291300	8296260	quite in mass as they do but i don't know i at the same time my perception's fucked because i'm
8296260	8299860	in california not georgia and my understanding is things are very different out there so
8299860	8306260	it might just be the same old dragon con we'll see but i i know the folks behind it will not have it
8306260	8310340	if they don't think it's going to be safe i have that trust because i know there's people many
8310340	8315940	people in atlanta who work at the cdc so uh and uh many folks on dragon con because of that but
8315940	8320580	anyway assuming i get out there um in september i will look forward to playing bobby's table he'll
8320580	8327620	have it by then right i think so i think so um which by the way they changed my flight out to
8327620	8332820	dragon con i had to call delta to try to get an earlier flight i was on hold for 40 minutes and
8332820	8336100	still didn't get through so i have to try calling again tomorrow because the online wouldn't do it
8336100	8341220	for me trying to get on an earlier flight because um it has me getting there at like eight getting
8341220	8346500	to the airport at like eight o'clock on wednesday eight pm and that's um pretty late in the day so i
8346500	8351060	want to catch a early morning flight and get there a little sooner if i can because we have a
8351060	8356100	tradition we always go to that 24 diner around the corner on wednesday night and that was the very
8356100	8360500	first place i took alan when we went to atlanta was that little diner where he drank way too much
8360500	8366500	sweet tea and uh we always go there on wednesday nights before the craziness kicks in and if i get
8366500	8373940	there that late i mean i guess they're 24 hour but still still still still all right um okay
8373940	8378180	i think i think that's about it uh i think uh we're gonna wrap up that's about the end of the
8378180	8384260	show uh before we do let's get some final thoughts um let me say of course as i always do here at the
8384260	8387860	end of the show thank you for listening to orange launch radio whether you were listening live here
