WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Years ago, Google's big priority was Google+, and news reports stated that Google execs

00:13.720 --> 00:17.120
and management were incentivizing staff to integrate Google Plus into all their products

00:17.120 --> 00:18.320
as quickly as possible.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.000
Well, their bread and butter service, Search Everywhere and Everything, is finally coming

00:22.000 --> 00:24.600
to Stadia one year and six months after its release.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.800
I guess it wasn't as important because there's no ads in the Stadia interface.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.320
That's Mike Fetch for this week.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.720
Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of

00:32.720 --> 00:36.280
the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.280 --> 00:43.800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:43.800 --> 00:45.600
every gamer has a voice.

00:45.600 --> 00:52.480
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again tonight, May the 2nd of

00:52.480 --> 00:57.040
2021 with episode number 867 of our show.

00:57.040 --> 01:03.120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined every week, socially distant still, with Dark Sakura

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
or Jamie Sommers.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
Hello.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
Hi.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Hi.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
How are you?

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
I'm okay.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.120
Good, good.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.120
Doing stuff.

01:11.120 --> 01:16.320
You were working hard last week, so you did a stream after, so live, because of course

01:16.320 --> 01:20.320
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of

01:20.320 --> 01:25.520
Geeks Network, VOG Network on Twitch, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.600
And a lot of weeks we kind of pass the reins to other people, Alan's done a stream after

01:30.600 --> 01:35.040
the show, some of our friends we've raided after the show, but you actually did a live

01:35.040 --> 01:36.640
stream last week.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.040
You were playing Dead by Daylight, which we've talked at length, gross, disgusting, filthy

01:41.040 --> 01:44.640
length on this show about, but you were actually showing that off.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.560
And I got to say, I was surprised, I remember we were talking before last week's show and

01:48.560 --> 01:51.440
you were like, oh, I'll probably just go for like an hour and then send it to somebody

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
else.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.800
I'm getting into bed at like midnight and I have a Chromecast in the bedroom now, so

01:57.800 --> 02:00.520
I watch Twitch a lot on the TV Alan and I watch.

02:00.520 --> 02:07.240
You were still going at like 12, 15 last Sunday and I'm like, she's going to regret this,

02:07.240 --> 02:08.240
but you had a good stream.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.240
I was spiteful.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.760
But you had a good stream, right?

02:10.760 --> 02:11.760
I did.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.400
And plus, something else happened not too long after that, and I really am so proud

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
of this.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.120
I have to tell the story I've told you already.

02:20.120 --> 02:26.720
So I tried nurse for the first time sometime after that, a couple of days after that, and

02:26.720 --> 02:27.880
I wasn't on stream or anything.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
This was just me playing.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.520
I decided just to try nurse because there was some nurse achievements to do.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.800
So I made it all the way through my first game.

02:35.800 --> 02:41.320
No add ons, no nothing except for, what's her main thing?

02:41.320 --> 02:46.480
I didn't use Strider, I used nurses calling the healing one.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.040
So anyway, so I'm going through it and everyone, of course, is running over me because nurses

02:50.040 --> 02:53.180
fucking hard to learn and write it.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.480
And everyone was just being such a piece of shit about it.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.480
They were being little assholes.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.800
So I wait, I, you know, I chase everyone because I'm just like, just get out, get out, get

03:01.800 --> 03:02.800
out.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.200
And I was going to hit them until they left.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.280
And this one, Yui stayed around and like tried to run circles around me.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.400
So I managed to hit her.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.920
And then she like positioned herself to where if I hit her again, she'd fall through the

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
gate.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
So I was like, okay, I'll go ahead and hit you.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.120
But she didn't fall through the exit gate.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.080
Guess what I did?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
I hooked her.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.080
Good job.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.560
Right in front of the exit.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.560
And I sat there watching her die and it was beautiful.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.800
You know, it is interesting, you know, and I know we've talked a lot about Dead by Daylight,

03:32.800 --> 03:38.040
but it is interesting how that game, you know, we both enjoy it for, you know, different

03:38.040 --> 03:40.800
reasons and enjoy kind of getting in there and playing it.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.320
But a lot of times the people in it can really be toxic, which is weird because it's a game

03:46.320 --> 03:50.360
that reaches such a diverse audience and that really, you know, strikes a chord with, you

03:50.360 --> 03:55.640
know, we've talked about this before, you know, the LGBTQIA plus community.

03:55.640 --> 03:59.880
And it's really, you know, I was just playing for fun a few days ago and I was playing as

03:59.880 --> 04:02.020
Pyramid Head and I got a 4K.

04:02.020 --> 04:08.680
And as soon as it's done, the chat lights up going, boy, you're a, Pyramid Head is sexy,

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
but not you.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.680
You could have been so much better.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.680
You could have done.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.680
It's like, I got a 4K.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.500
And it's like, they're just sitting there talking trash.

04:14.500 --> 04:20.520
Now my instinct when I see that happen, I just, I actually sit there with the chat open

04:20.520 --> 04:24.940
so they can know I'm still logged in and I can see it, but I choose not to respond.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.180
And I just block them.

04:26.180 --> 04:29.380
If you want to talk shit, I just block.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.460
I don't need that.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.460
But what is it?

04:31.460 --> 04:35.100
So why do people feel the need to be toxic?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
Is the real question.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.340
And this is a question much bigger than Dead by Daylight.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.340
But why do you feel they need to be toxic?

04:42.340 --> 04:48.580
But they're not super anonymous because a lot of times you can find who's streaming.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.380
Yeah.

04:50.380 --> 04:55.780
And you can find who's streaming and you can often find a little bit of dirt here and there.

04:55.780 --> 04:56.780
Yeah.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.580
Well, that's, that's why I won't put TTV in my name on that game.

04:59.580 --> 05:03.720
I don't because I've watched it happen too many times on some of the streams I watch

05:03.720 --> 05:07.640
is that, you know, people will have TTV in their name so they know it's a Twitch streamer.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.460
And then what'll happen after the match, people come into the Twitch chat and start talking

05:11.460 --> 05:12.460
shit.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.980
And it's like, that would annoy me.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.940
But I've had people come in on those streams.

05:17.940 --> 05:24.980
Like I even saw it happen on a LC stream the other day, Losing Color, where someone came

05:24.980 --> 05:29.860
in and was like, hi, I was so and so in your match and I thought you did a really great

05:29.860 --> 05:32.540
job, you know, even though I died.

05:32.540 --> 05:40.940
So I've seen a lot of that happen and I want to make it a point that if I do see someone

05:40.940 --> 05:42.980
now, of course, I'm struggling right now.

05:42.980 --> 05:46.380
I've played seven times, right?

05:46.380 --> 05:51.540
And I will still sometimes if I find that it's a streamer, I'll, I'll find their chat

05:51.540 --> 05:53.580
and say, hey, I'm new.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.020
Thanks for being cool.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.020
Yeah.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.660
And Alan's had a few positive interactions like that too.

05:58.660 --> 06:01.520
Like he, he made us, he made a swiffing party out of people.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.520
So you're right.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.520
You're right there.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.580
For every bad apple, there are some good apples and I think we tend to let the bad apples

06:07.580 --> 06:09.180
ruin it for everybody else.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.180
So you're right.

06:10.420 --> 06:13.540
I kind of put that in perspective a little bit, but I still won't put TTV in my name

06:13.540 --> 06:14.540
when I play.

06:14.540 --> 06:20.420
Like, I just, well, I can't right now since I'm on Stadia and I hate, I might have to

06:20.420 --> 06:21.420
pay for Parallels.

06:21.420 --> 06:25.980
I got another virtualizer and when I had Windows installed on it and everything, it just ended

06:25.980 --> 06:27.260
up crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.900
It wasn't any good, but only pay 10 bucks for it.

06:29.900 --> 06:36.460
But anyway I have been I mean, I get, I actually started paying for Stadia pro today, which

06:36.460 --> 06:39.700
I guess I could do with my gaming week.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.620
But it's just, I don't know.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.340
It's been an interesting experience.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.620
When someone's going to be toxic, I just leave chat immediately.

06:49.620 --> 06:55.980
I don't even give them a voice and it's made me happy.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.700
I think that's the best policy.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.060
Just don't, don't respond.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.060
Don't give into it.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.540
Like they want a reaction.

07:01.540 --> 07:02.780
It's yeah.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.660
And when I find someone playing solid, I will give them positive feedback.

07:06.660 --> 07:12.540
You know, I will give the credit where the credit is due and I've only ever once called

07:12.540 --> 07:18.700
somebody else for being, you know, pretty much a child about the whole thing.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.900
And I did gloat at the UE.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.980
She deserved it.

07:22.980 --> 07:25.420
Some comments from chat and I haven't forgot about Loki.

07:25.420 --> 07:29.020
I would get to Loki too, but some comments from chat, SGO 100 Matt says, trolls are going

07:29.020 --> 07:30.020
to troll.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.020
Tiger Cause says, some people take gaming way too seriously.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.740
Some gamers just have no tolerance for people who goof off in a multiplayer game.

07:37.740 --> 07:39.820
You could turn the voice chat off entirely.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.300
There is no voice chat in Dead by Daylight.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.540
You know, that's why Discord is huge when you're going to play with friends.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.460
But it's all in the little text box, which is interesting because if you play on Xbox

07:49.460 --> 07:52.620
One or PlayStation, you don't get, it's interesting.

07:52.620 --> 07:59.020
Only the PC based people, so Stadia, Windows Store, Steam only see the chat box.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.860
If you're on consoles, you don't see a switch.

08:00.860 --> 08:01.860
You don't see it.

08:01.860 --> 08:06.820
So, uh, it's, that's interesting too, but anyway, um, let me say hello.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.820
Of course.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.100
I have to introduce, of course, here with us every week.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.100
Tech master, Loki.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.100
Hi, Loki.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.300
Hey, why is everybody so toxic?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.300
Loki?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.300
Cause that's the internet.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.500
I guess that's where the toxicity goes.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
That's true.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
That is true.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.660
You have a nice family friendly peer, a kind hearted game playing behind you tonight.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.380
I noticed Pokemon snap is going on behind you tonight.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.380
Yes.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.820
The game that my kids said they don't like what, what, what happened?

08:31.820 --> 08:33.580
What is wrong with your children?

08:33.580 --> 08:39.340
Cause it's probably too boring for them.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.420
They're like, girl, it's not like a normal Pokemon game.

08:42.420 --> 08:48.540
I'm like, yeah, I know it's not supposed to be, but it's like a Pokemon game size.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.580
I bought it for 60 bucks and then no one's playing it.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.140
So it's cool.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.340
Hey, let me borrow it.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.340
I can't.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.220
It's digital crap.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.340
I have a physical version, Jamie, but I'm actually playing it.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.300
So you're gonna have to wait a while to borrow it.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.300
Eventually.

09:04.300 --> 09:09.300
Plus I have a, I have a ring I want back before you get that.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.580
Well, I threw out my back before I could use it.

09:11.580 --> 09:12.580
Oh yeah.

09:12.580 --> 09:13.580
That's right.

09:13.580 --> 09:14.580
That's right.

09:14.580 --> 09:15.580
And I've got the okay to start using it again.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.580
But if you want it back, I'll bring it back.

09:16.580 --> 09:17.580
I don't need it.

09:17.580 --> 09:22.780
I don't need it back tomorrow, but by, by the time I'm ready tomorrow's my day off.

09:22.780 --> 09:27.140
By the time I'm ready to let go of Pokemon snap for a little bit, I think, I think that'll

09:27.140 --> 09:28.140
be good.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.140
So.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.140
Okay.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.140
All right.

09:31.940 --> 09:32.940
Let's get into tonight's show.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.460
Now that we've already talked about several games here at the top of the show, let's talk

09:36.460 --> 09:38.860
about our kickoff topic tonight.

09:38.860 --> 09:42.980
We have a couple of Twitch stories here to start us off tonight, Twitch based things.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.340
And I thought these were both like, so it's very meta.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.940
We're going to talk about Twitch on Twitch, but you know, we always say we're talking

09:48.940 --> 09:52.700
about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.940
And definitely Twitch plays into the last two of those things, gaming culture and gamer

09:56.940 --> 09:57.940
lifestyle.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.580
There's some culture and lifestyle that has nothing to do with gaming that we see a lot

10:01.580 --> 10:04.380
of on Twitch, but I'm not going to talk about hot tubs tonight.

10:04.380 --> 10:08.340
I'm going to talk about the gaming side of things and the political side of things and

10:08.340 --> 10:15.460
the getting people motivated to participate in charity and political action side of things.

10:15.460 --> 10:19.820
The first story about Twitch tonight has to do with the Anti-Defamation League or the

10:19.820 --> 10:21.860
ADL.

10:21.860 --> 10:25.900
And they did a big report basically about Twitch and some of the different streams that

10:25.900 --> 10:29.820
happened recently and kind of come to the conclusion that Twitch needs to invest in

10:29.820 --> 10:31.260
more moderation tools.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.580
I mean, water is wet.

10:33.580 --> 10:34.900
The pope is Catholic.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.900
Bears shit in woods.

10:35.900 --> 10:36.900
Right.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.300
Like, I think we all kind of know this.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.540
But what I think is interesting about this is that, you know, because the ADL kind of

10:41.540 --> 10:46.300
did this study, there's some facts that really go into this and some analysis that go into

10:46.300 --> 10:47.300
this.

10:47.300 --> 10:52.460
They did a report called Politics, Gaming Culture and Content Moderation on Twitch.

10:52.460 --> 10:58.100
And they actually analyzed several high profile streams.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.100
What did they look at?

10:59.100 --> 11:04.900
They looked at four political events, October 21st, 2020.

11:04.900 --> 11:09.940
That was the day that AOC and Ilhan Omar played Among Us.

11:09.940 --> 11:10.940
That was huge.

11:10.940 --> 11:11.940
Right.

11:11.940 --> 11:12.940
We talked about it on this show.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.940
That was a huge stream.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.540
Two hundred and twenty five thousand plus comments on that stream.

11:17.540 --> 11:22.400
They did another stream in November, AOC, excuse me, did another stream in November

11:22.400 --> 11:28.280
of 2020 with a Canadian member of parliament, Yagmeet Singh and some other popular streamers.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.420
There was a covid-19 relief effort for that one.

11:30.420 --> 11:36.620
So that was analyzed December 22nd when Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff were running for Senate

11:36.620 --> 11:37.620
in Georgia.

11:37.620 --> 11:38.620
Spoiler alert.

11:38.620 --> 11:39.620
They won.

11:39.620 --> 11:43.300
I mean, you should know that now by now, because this was four months after December, right.

11:43.300 --> 11:50.820
They played UNO with streamers around Google, around Twitch to get out the vote.

11:50.820 --> 11:57.060
And then in January of 2021, AOC was back again with Reddit co-founder and they were

11:57.060 --> 12:00.100
talking about the GameStop stonk phenomenon.

12:00.100 --> 12:05.800
So anyway, all these streams were analyzed, but also looked at Jimmy Fallon did a Twitch

12:05.800 --> 12:11.160
appearance on April 6th, playing Among Us with members of The Roots.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.640
And that stream got seventy four thousand plus comments.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.640
But what's the difference?

12:15.640 --> 12:18.620
OK, why am I bringing up all these streams?

12:18.620 --> 12:24.880
It turns out the political streams had a lot less problems with content than the Jimmy

12:24.880 --> 12:25.880
Fallon stream.

12:25.880 --> 12:31.200
The Jimmy Fallon stream was spammed with something called the tryhard emote.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.480
I don't know this and I don't want to know it because apparently it's used to harass

12:35.480 --> 12:36.720
black streamers.

12:36.720 --> 12:42.060
So I admit I am ignorant as to what it is and I don't need it explained.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.440
If that's what it's for, then I don't need to know about it.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.040
But that's just what's in this report here.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.960
Apparently that emote was used in over twenty five hundred comments on Jimmy Fallon's stream.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.160
Four percent of all chat activity had that negative emote.

12:57.160 --> 13:03.680
However, the most popular comments in AOC's January 2021 stream were called were to the

13:03.680 --> 13:09.680
moon and hold the line, which are relatively non offensive things.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.360
I would say not offensive at all as far as these are the things they say on Wall Street

13:14.360 --> 13:16.360
bets about Dogecoin and all that stuff.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.360
Right.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.360
And holding on your game stops.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.360
Stop now.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.240
They don't talk about Doge on Wall Street bets.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
Sorry.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
Sorry.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
Don't offend anyone.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.520
OK, but they but they do use that saying with Doge.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.520
Right.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.720
Didn't didn't Elon Musk or whatever tweet that Doge to the moon or something like I'm

13:31.720 --> 13:34.160
not completely off everything.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.160
OK.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
OK.

13:36.160 --> 13:40.000
But anyway, so what's the difference here?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.920
Why was Jimmy Fallon's stream attacked with all this, you know, racist garbage and AOC

13:45.920 --> 13:50.560
stream was relatively, you know, I'm sure it was there with that many people, but it

13:50.560 --> 13:55.480
wasn't nearly we had these other more mean positive meme things that were floating to

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
the top.

13:56.480 --> 14:02.640
Well, in this study, they actually analyzed and showed that Fallon had three moderators

14:02.640 --> 14:08.920
for the stream and they all seem to be new to Twitch because they were called TSGAF mod

14:08.920 --> 14:10.280
one, two and three.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.240
They were accounts that look like they were made for the stream for AOC's October 2020

14:15.240 --> 14:16.240
stream.

14:16.240 --> 14:22.560
Fourteen bots and human moderators, including a handful of Twitch employees.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.220
These moderators kept the discussion on track.

14:25.220 --> 14:26.220
What a shock.

14:26.220 --> 14:28.280
Am I right?

14:28.280 --> 14:29.860
More more moderators.

14:29.860 --> 14:36.660
And especially, I think the seasoned part of it ended up having a better discussion.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.040
So what all happened at the end of the day here?

14:39.040 --> 14:43.900
So the report recommends that politicians collaborate with experienced moderators and

14:43.900 --> 14:48.100
inform themselves about the Twitch community before going live.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.160
There are also suggestions for Twitch itself.

14:51.160 --> 14:55.960
Number one, enforce the newly revised hate and harassments policy consistently and for

14:55.960 --> 14:59.520
all streamers, regardless of their popularity.

14:59.520 --> 15:05.200
Increase its investment in moderation tools as the platform grows, require trained moderators

15:05.200 --> 15:08.480
for streams featuring prominent public figures.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.720
That's interesting.

15:09.720 --> 15:15.800
And provide effective tools, support and justice for marginalized streamers, including specific

15:15.800 --> 15:21.080
ways to escalate reports of harassment to the platform and access to experienced community

15:21.080 --> 15:22.080
moderators.

15:22.080 --> 15:27.440
Now, this whole study was done before new chat tools rolled out on Twitch with threaded

15:27.440 --> 15:30.120
replies and all that on April 22nd.

15:30.120 --> 15:35.280
However, they're saying this doesn't change the bottom line about what was found about

15:35.280 --> 15:37.780
Twitch communities.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.780
So what do you guys kind of...

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
I know that was a lot.

15:39.780 --> 15:40.780
I just threw out you to process.

15:40.780 --> 15:44.600
But what do you guys kind of think about the whole like, maybe Twitch needs to invest in

15:44.600 --> 15:52.560
more moderation, even though some people, when they hear that, think, my free speech.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.560
I think they should invest in more moderation.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.560
Free speech.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
I'm sorry.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.060
Oh, no, go ahead.

16:00.060 --> 16:07.500
Free speech doesn't count on a hosted environment.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
There are...

16:08.500 --> 16:12.640
When you use a service, you agree to play by their rules.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.640
So end of story.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.400
Loki, do you want to finish your thought?

16:16.400 --> 16:20.200
No, I was just saying, I think that more tools could be helpful.

16:20.200 --> 16:24.160
I mean, there's a lot of things that Twitch needs to do to improve their platform.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.800
And I think additional moderation tools would be helpful.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.800
And I noticed some comments in chat.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.280
Bobby Blackwolf has talked a lot about games done quick and some of the things he's kind

16:34.280 --> 16:38.520
of learned about the event, having participated as a volunteer, and mentions that there's

16:38.520 --> 16:42.680
actually applications for chat moderators during the volunteer application.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.840
And yeah, SJ100Matt is saying, I'm sure GDQ has a ton of mods now.

16:45.840 --> 16:51.020
And yeah, that's not entirely surprising to me either, that an event that large would

16:51.020 --> 16:55.960
unfortunately be the target of trolls, even though it's supposed to be money for charity.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.800
That doesn't matter to some people, right?

16:58.800 --> 17:02.880
And Tigerclass says they have to moderate the chat so it stays on topic about the event.

17:02.880 --> 17:08.480
SJ100Matt says, folks complaining about freedoms being taken away don't know what it's like

17:08.480 --> 17:11.600
to truly have their freedoms taken away.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.080
Preach.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.480
Preach.

17:14.480 --> 17:19.320
Questbuster says some streams also set their chat to sub mode to cut back on spam from

17:19.320 --> 17:22.880
undesirable comments, which I believe GDQ does.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.600
They're either sub only or follower only.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.640
They're one of the two.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.520
I'm sure I'll be corrected in a moment here in chat.

17:28.520 --> 17:32.320
But I know they do that to try to cut back on some of that as well.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.160
You know, and I'm not trying to make this about VOG Network.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.240
We have an awesome mod team for the size that we are.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.120
You know, obviously we're not AOC, we're not Jimmy Fallon.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.520
You know, we're not getting that type of stuff yet.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.440
But if we did, we would certainly try to up what we're doing on our moderation side of

17:48.440 --> 17:50.800
things to stay afloat of that.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.640
But I just realistically, that's not happening anytime soon.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.000
That's for sure.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.680
And Bobby Blackwell says during AGDQ and SGDQ it is sub only.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.420
OK, that's what I thought.

18:01.420 --> 18:09.380
So anyway, there is somewhat of a side story to this.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.500
And this isn't even the second story I really want to talk about.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.020
But I think this is important when we talked about because one of the one of the things

18:15.020 --> 18:19.980
that was in that report was it was about the marginalized streamers.

18:19.980 --> 18:24.420
Yes, provide effective tools, support and justice for marginalized streamers.

18:24.420 --> 18:29.620
This leads to another conversation about how Twitch has really been requested to add certain

18:29.620 --> 18:33.540
tags that for whatever reason they've been resistant to doing.

18:33.540 --> 18:39.180
We know we have an LGBTQIA tag on Twitch, but one of those letters in particular, the

18:39.180 --> 18:44.540
T or the trans community has really been requesting their own tag for quite some time.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.780
And for whatever reason, Twitch has been resisting the calls to this.

18:48.780 --> 18:54.420
My assumption, I'm left to assume in this situation, is that they are worried that if

18:54.420 --> 19:00.420
trolls can easily find trans streamers, that they're going to get targeted for harassment.

19:00.420 --> 19:06.180
In my opinion, that speaks as a very big negative to Twitch as a platform and how they're failing

19:06.180 --> 19:07.260
on moderation.

19:07.260 --> 19:13.460
If they can't effectively add a tag and because they're worried that, you know, folks are

19:13.460 --> 19:17.780
going to get harassed, then Twitch kind of needs to do something about that, I think.

19:17.780 --> 19:22.660
And this report that I just talked about, I think, is also kind of saying that, well,

19:22.660 --> 19:27.380
because Twitch has been failing to do this for such a long time, and I've seen requests

19:27.380 --> 19:32.300
for a black tag on Twitch, I've seen requests for several other marginalized communities

19:32.300 --> 19:34.140
on Twitch.

19:34.140 --> 19:38.860
Because Twitch has been failing to do this, other, leave it to the internet, someone else

19:38.860 --> 19:42.180
is coming up and doing it instead.

19:42.180 --> 19:47.460
A site that has been gaining more and more visibility these past few weeks is called

19:47.460 --> 19:55.020
peer2peer.live.

19:55.020 --> 20:00.740
It is a hub that allows a Twitch streamer to create identity-based tags for their own

20:00.740 --> 20:03.620
streams, such as trans, disabled, black.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.500
Those are some examples of the many tags there.

20:06.500 --> 20:11.220
Steph Lower, I hope I said the name right, is the founder of peer2peer, who identifies

20:11.220 --> 20:16.260
a trans woman who streams under the name Ferociously Steph.

20:16.260 --> 20:27.660
So, and in a comment to the blog in Gadget, Steph said, the essence is that people of

20:27.660 --> 20:32.500
marginalized identities feel safest in spaces that understand them, and the easiest way

20:32.500 --> 20:35.780
to find those safe spaces is by finding their peers.

20:35.780 --> 20:40.180
And that discoverability has been totally blocked by Twitch.

20:40.180 --> 20:45.180
And what's interesting about this is that she's also on Twitch's Safety Advisory Council.

20:45.220 --> 20:47.660
So she has a direct line of communication with the company.

20:47.660 --> 20:51.660
But for whatever reason, Twitch doesn't seem to be doing enough.

20:51.660 --> 20:57.220
She also says in a comment, Twitch has not done enough to protect me in the slightest.

20:57.220 --> 21:03.140
So it is interesting that the community is starting to build these tools, which Twitch

21:03.140 --> 21:04.940
is failing to do.

21:04.940 --> 21:10.740
So Twitch, and if Twitch is afraid of these marginalized communities being harassed, these

21:10.740 --> 21:12.380
tools are coming anyway.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.740
So Twitch needs to deal with this, right?

21:15.740 --> 21:20.980
So yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, especially as sites like

21:20.980 --> 21:22.980
peer2peer live get bigger and bigger.

21:22.980 --> 21:28.900
I think it is fascinating that she kind of has that in with Twitch, and it's still kind

21:28.900 --> 21:29.900
of not working.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.700
It's very, very interesting to me.

21:31.700 --> 21:34.940
You would think of anyone that could get it, it'd be someone that's on the Safety Council,

21:34.940 --> 21:38.260
you know, get it done, but you would think or at least would like know the reasons why

21:38.260 --> 21:40.060
Twitch is resisting this whole thing.

21:40.140 --> 21:44.780
Again, I'm left to assume Twitch is worried about, you know, oh, they're going to get

21:44.780 --> 21:45.780
targeted.

21:45.780 --> 21:50.380
Well, the community is really, you know, demanding this so that people can kind of find their

21:50.380 --> 21:51.380
tribe, right?

21:51.380 --> 21:55.020
And find the streamers that are of interest to them or streamers that they can relate

21:55.020 --> 21:56.460
to and so forth.

21:56.460 --> 22:02.740
So I just think Twitch needs to prepare for this and not continue to table the issue.

22:02.740 --> 22:09.580
I want to say that that petition on Twitch's site to add a trans tag.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.100
I could be wrong.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.220
I want to say it's been going for a year.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.740
It's been out there for a long time.

22:14.740 --> 22:15.740
It's ridiculous.

22:15.740 --> 22:18.340
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.180
I have signed the petition myself.

22:20.180 --> 22:22.780
I hope others will consider doing that as well.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.580
Now, I want to talk about something I kind of brought up in that little topic or that

22:29.580 --> 22:34.900
little story there was I talked about using Twitch to find your tribe.

22:35.900 --> 22:40.060
So this takes me to another story that has just been talked about in the past couple

22:40.060 --> 22:41.700
of days.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.660
And this is something that kind of caught fire on Twitter.

22:43.660 --> 22:51.260
And this is where I saw it, where Bill Maher, of course, opened his mouth and had some things

22:51.260 --> 22:54.420
to say about Twitch streams.

22:54.420 --> 22:57.900
And gosh, darn, the story I linked here is the wrong one.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.620
Let me see if I can find it real quick.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.900
So it's thanks.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.900
Yeah.

23:04.900 --> 23:05.900
Who cares?

23:05.900 --> 23:06.900
I know.

23:06.900 --> 23:10.900
Well, Bill Maher doesn't think I'm cool.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.900
What's my life worth anymore?

23:12.900 --> 23:15.900
I'm going to explain why.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.900
Let's get the story here first, though.

23:22.900 --> 23:23.900
Do you want me to?

23:23.900 --> 23:24.900
Yeah, yeah.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.900
Could you?

23:25.900 --> 23:26.900
Because mine's not coming up.

23:26.900 --> 23:27.900
Sorry.

23:27.900 --> 23:28.900
Live radio fail.

23:28.900 --> 23:29.900
Sorry.

23:29.900 --> 23:30.900
Yeah, no problem.

23:30.900 --> 23:38.900
Bill Maher basically was kind of commenting on, you know, what Twitch viewers, you know,

23:38.900 --> 23:41.900
have what he thinks of Twitch viewers, basically.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.900
So I don't know is on his real time with Bill Maher show.

23:45.900 --> 23:50.900
And he was saying, let's see that.

23:50.900 --> 23:57.900
Gosh, I'm sorry, this like it scrolled everything way down the page here.

23:57.900 --> 24:05.900
So basically discussing technological literacy, he was comparing comparing 80 year olds who

24:05.900 --> 24:10.900
can't use phones to younger people who won't get off of theirs.

24:10.900 --> 24:16.900
And then talking about I guess he made a comment about Twitch saying that I just think people

24:16.900 --> 24:19.900
watching other people playing video games is a waste of fucking time.

24:19.900 --> 24:20.900
Yes.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.900
That was the that was your opinion.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.900
Cool.

24:23.900 --> 24:24.900
Yeah.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.900
He said, I just think people watching other people playing video games is a fucking waste

24:27.900 --> 24:28.900
of time.

24:28.900 --> 24:33.900
Now, look, we could sit here and rattle on for an hour about how Bill Maher is old and

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
out of touch with a comment like that.

24:35.900 --> 24:40.900
And look, I there's there's that popular school of thought that a comment like that is only

24:40.900 --> 24:42.900
made to get that type of attention.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.900
And that is exactly what he's getting on Twitch right now is everybody.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.900
And I've been guilty of this, too, is, quote, replying the clip of him from his TV show

24:50.900 --> 24:54.900
and dunking on him with with the replies and so forth.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.900
Here's the thing, though.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.900
Obviously, there are people like that, and I don't want to have a discussion about what

25:00.900 --> 25:01.900
an idiot Bill Maher is.

25:01.900 --> 25:02.900
I don't I don't really care.

25:02.900 --> 25:08.900
OK, let's have a discussion about the comment itself and how there are a lot of people out

25:08.900 --> 25:11.900
there, because it wasn't just that Bill Maher said it.

25:11.900 --> 25:15.900
It was that the audience in the studio started applauding and all this other stuff.

25:15.900 --> 25:16.900
Right.

25:16.900 --> 25:21.900
So there is, folks, and maybe because Bill Maher is of a certain age in the 60s or 70s

25:21.900 --> 25:22.900
or whatever, I don't even know how old he is.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.900
Is he in his low 70s, late 60s probably?

25:24.900 --> 25:25.900
I have no idea.

25:25.900 --> 25:26.900
I don't know.

25:26.900 --> 25:27.900
Who cares?

25:27.900 --> 25:31.900
He's he's I think it might speak to sort of like maybe a certain generation that doesn't

25:31.900 --> 25:35.900
quite get what Twitch like really is about.

25:35.900 --> 25:40.900
But the reality is, while I'm looking at a story like this about him dunking on Twitch

25:40.900 --> 25:43.900
and I don't understand what's exciting about watching other people fucking play video games,

25:43.900 --> 25:47.900
I'm looking at another story over here that's talking about the Oscars last week being the

25:47.900 --> 25:50.900
lowest rated Oscars ever.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.900
OK, it's the lowest.

25:52.900 --> 25:56.900
They didn't do it in the same time frame they usually do the movies.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.900
You know, people have been going to movies for the past year.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.900
So it's been a weird year.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.900
The pandemic kind of changed the Oscars.

26:02.900 --> 26:04.900
All of that stuff right played into it.

26:04.900 --> 26:08.900
But the story that I was reading over there was that there's there's things go at Twitch

26:08.900 --> 26:12.900
had more people watching it than were watching the Oscars.

26:12.900 --> 26:17.900
And that's the very real nature of this world that we live in now is that this homemade

26:17.900 --> 26:22.900
content is starting to give a lot of this produced content a run for its money.

26:22.900 --> 26:27.900
So I would say there's certainly a part of Bill Maher that feels threatened by what's happening

26:27.900 --> 26:32.900
on Twitch and the fact that there's more people watching people on Twitch than his show.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.900
Right. And he should feel threatened because the gaming industry is way bigger than the

26:36.900 --> 26:37.900
television industry anyways.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.900
And I mean, honestly, his his show is probably pretty niche.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.900
So it's just, you know, that's fine.

26:44.900 --> 26:49.900
Make your comment and get some exposure because, you know, really it comes down to like,

26:49.900 --> 26:54.900
oh, yeah, I forgot Bill Maher was even a person that existed and had a show.

26:54.900 --> 26:57.900
So now now I remember that. So I don't know.

26:57.900 --> 27:06.900
I mean, I guess no, you know, no press coverage is better than any press coverage is better than no press coverage.

27:07.900 --> 27:10.900
So. I don't really care.

27:10.900 --> 27:16.900
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, oh, God, there was an amazing tweet that showed the ratings for the Oscars versus the Game Awards.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.900
And the picture was the dude saying, fuck the Oscars or at the Oscars.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.900
One small problem with that tweet, because I saw it, too.

27:23.900 --> 27:31.900
It considered the Oscars day after ratings in the US versus the Game Awards globally.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.900
So there was a little bit of apples to oranges going on there.

27:35.900 --> 27:41.900
However, I don't want to like I don't want to what if what about ism the whole thing,

27:41.900 --> 27:45.900
because I think it still does make a point that the Game Awards are growing.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.900
The Oscars are shrinking. Okay.

27:47.900 --> 27:55.900
I think that is still a very clear point that can be made no matter what the numbers actually boil down to in that whole scenario.

27:55.900 --> 28:04.900
And, you know, again, take this to what, you know, that guy said about Twitch and who wants to watch people fucking play video games.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.900
Well, let me ask you this. And actually, Jamie, I'm going to pick on you a little bit.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.900
Well, no, I'm not going to pick on you.

28:10.900 --> 28:16.900
But I just I have noticed, especially in the past couple of weeks since you've started getting into Dead by Daylight fandom,

28:16.900 --> 28:25.900
I can't watch people streaming Dead by Daylight anymore without seeing you in the chat room, which is great because we have similar.

28:25.900 --> 28:30.900
I know. I love it. I love it. But I think I've turned you into a couple.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.900
You have no. And I love it. I'm not I'm not shading that whatsoever.

28:33.900 --> 28:39.900
But I do notice, Dark Soccer, I feel like you're more actively participating in Twitch these last few weeks.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.900
I don't know if this is true. Tell me if I'm wrong.

28:41.900 --> 28:46.900
You've probably been more actively participating in Twitch in the last month than you have any other month.

28:46.900 --> 28:53.900
Yeah, I would say so, because I actually am really enjoying the people with whom I'm interacting.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.900
So, yeah, you're getting to my question.

28:55.900 --> 29:04.900
So my question is, are you spending hours watching Losing Color because you want to watch Losing Color play video games?

29:04.900 --> 29:14.900
Half of it. I mean, right now I'm watching a lot of good Dead by Daylight streamers for educational purposes so I can see what they do and get better.

29:14.900 --> 29:20.900
Of course, I'm also watching a lot of survivors so I can see what survivors do so I know how to counter it.

29:20.900 --> 29:29.900
But the other half has to do with that general personality like I, I, during lunch one day I was watching some, some girl play.

29:29.900 --> 29:36.900
And it was just like she just wasn't interesting and she had this big superiority complex and whatnot like okay I'm done with you. I don't care.

29:36.900 --> 29:46.900
These others are personable, no matter how many followers they have, they're gracious about their followers. They thank them for the smallest donation.

29:46.900 --> 30:01.900
And even you know, last night when I was in Putin's stream. I, you know, one of the first things I do when I hop in is I just sort of go ahead, if I'm not hosting somebody I'll go and say okay slash host, you know, whatever channel I'm watching.

30:01.900 --> 30:15.900
And he's like, I knew you were in here because I heard the host notification and I was like, Yeah, but you know, but I think that that part of it is, is watching those gracious gracious streamers.

30:15.900 --> 30:23.900
Who are entertaining and personable at the same time that they're playing the game. Yeah.

30:23.900 --> 30:36.900
And they interact. They don't just ignore their chat, and they they're, they end up coming up with inside jokes for their community on all this, you know, stuff that, you know, like, what was that thing I go piss girl.

30:37.900 --> 30:50.900
stream, which you wouldn't understand if you didn't watch that I keep bringing up the same streamer and I know he's a very, very big popular player on dead by daylight, and just, they create their own like cultures and you know, here at Vogue Network and I've

30:50.900 --> 31:02.900
always talked about this we're very like we don't have a huge audience but we have a nice sized one, and we've created quite an environment here for you guys. What, what makes you watch us, we're not playing video games here at all.

31:02.900 --> 31:13.900
And I'd like to think it's because we have a good time and what we talked about and that whole where OLR started is that you know we started at the dining room, or excuse me the restaurant table.

31:13.900 --> 31:29.900
After playing DDR at Roseville Golf Land, sitting around just talking about our favorite hobby video games, and this is the virtual version of that so so giving each other shit happens without saying so so welcome to our dining table, pass the mozzarella sticks.

31:29.900 --> 31:41.900
You know, mozzarella sticks. The reason why I bring all this up is that this is what Bill Maher and folks from a certain generation, or should I say a certain mindset at least are completely missing about Twitch.

31:41.900 --> 31:52.900
This is something that I've been guilty of in the past as well. This is something I think Bobby's been guilty of in the past as well probably a lot of us, because we, we didn't bring a well our or vogue or that stuff to Twitch, we probably should have done it

31:52.900 --> 32:06.900
years before we actually did. And it was, we kind of did you're right we did do it on Justin TV and all that but it didn't really like explode right out the gate, and this whole thing and Bobby had his Friday night gaming thing along and he'll he'll,

32:06.900 --> 32:16.900
he'll be happy to remind you about that story that he was doing Friday night gaming before there was a twitch and he got told I don't know how many times, who wants to sit there and watch other people play video games.

32:16.900 --> 32:28.900
So I think maybe because we had both done it in earlier forms and nobody really showed up we kind of wrote it off and didn't didn't go back to it for a long time, probably past the point we should have.

32:28.900 --> 32:41.900
But I know I've been one of those people that's like, I don't get why you sit there and watch video games, and it's not and what you learn is it's not about the video games it's about the people and it's about the community.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.900
And that's, that's really what it is.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.900
Yeah.

32:45.900 --> 32:49.900
Let's go to chat because I'm sure folks have their thoughts here.

32:49.900 --> 32:58.900
Bobby is in chat with a few good comments here saying I have zero interest in dead by daylight, but I'll watch Jamie and Alan play it. Yeah, I mean if you, you may not be.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.900
I appreciate it. Yeah.

33:00.900 --> 33:12.900
And Bobby says I watch Rob play Final Fantasy 14 for Rob, not for Final Fantasy 14 I could care less about it at this point well thank you, and also says I watch streamers for the streamers not necessarily for the games.

33:12.900 --> 33:23.900
The only exception is when the game is out and I don't yet have it and I want to see it played. That's a good point to like testing games a little bit getting to see the real stuff, or whatever.

33:23.900 --> 33:27.900
I want to experience Nino Cooney without having to sludge through.

33:28.900 --> 33:38.900
Imagine if Bobby had never played the Nino Cooney demo and instead watch somebody play it on release day, there may have been a very different reaction there.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.900
Who knows how terrible the game is.

33:41.900 --> 33:49.900
Just kidding, Bob. Oh yeah that's right Bobby says I watched Rob stream Nino Cooney to God that was years ago you have a great memory that's right I did stream that.

33:49.900 --> 34:03.900
Now quest Buster has a comment here about Bill Maher's statement saying, Maher doesn't know how deep it goes. It's not only the games, it's the knock on effect they have on people and the communities formed through them to especially in the past

34:03.900 --> 34:15.900
year. And I think this is why a lot of us are coming claws out to what this Bill Maher comment was, let's be real, this was some stupid ass joke written in the writing room.

34:15.900 --> 34:26.900
Hours before the show went live. This is not something Bill Maher fumes about in his library in his spare time, I have to say something nasty about twitch.

34:26.900 --> 34:38.900
Boiled down to like the most cliche of cliche things like nerds our target, people that watch people play games probably nerds, let's make fun of them point fingers at them.

34:38.900 --> 34:48.900
I mean that shit's been going on since. We can't talk shit about comic book nerds anymore because they rule Hollywood. So let's pick on someone else.

34:48.900 --> 35:02.900
Yeah and there's no, I mean, I don't know I think there's that kind of culture that you know it's more accepting now to be, you know, very passionate about different things and to be a collective it like, you know, for some people it's just.

35:02.900 --> 35:18.900
I don't know I get the joke, it was just kind of a throwaway thing, you know, he doesn't get it I guess technically that he thinks it's a fucking waste of time that's his opinion he's entitled to it, but he has a show is a platform, that is also a fucking waste of time.

35:18.900 --> 35:22.900
Yeah, there's many people that would tell you a television is a fucking waste of time.

35:23.900 --> 35:32.900
Yeah, yeah, so I don't know, whatever it does. Does this end on the note that Bill Maher is the ultimate postgame Dead by Daylight troll.

35:32.900 --> 35:46.900
Anyway, I don't think he even knows what that is, he probably doesn't. And I think that just goes to show how ignorant the comment was, I'm sure that is far I'm surprised the only thing he hasn't heard about like it, you know, really want to take targets of like

35:46.900 --> 35:59.900
Twitch, you know the hot tub streamers you know like make it a comment on that I mean geez like that's something I'm surprised he didn't go that route. Well yeah, if he if he had targeted the hot tub streamers I bet we wouldn't even be talking about it now.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.900
Nobody would have spread it around on Twitch.

36:02.900 --> 36:14.900
So yeah, so what I say to Bill Maher is I'm going to say, watch a drag queen play Dead by Daylight on Friday night and come back at me with a comment like that and tell me it's just about the video game, like seriously educate yourself.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.900
Anyway, all right, enough about that.

36:16.900 --> 36:26.900
Let's get into some positive stuff let's talk about our gaming weeks because video games are fun and I don't know about you guys but I've played some fun video games this week. So let's start with Dark Sakura How was your gaming week.

36:26.900 --> 36:29.900
It was more eventful than before.

36:29.900 --> 36:38.900
I did play Dead by Daylight I had my glorious ending to my nurse match that was my happy ending nurse game.

36:38.900 --> 36:48.900
I, I've been playing a lot of board scapes, I sent you a screenshot earlier about how incredibly addicted I am to it to which I replied intervention.

36:48.900 --> 36:49.900
Right.

36:49.900 --> 36:54.900
I've been playing Animal Crossing, I've been enjoying that as well.

36:54.900 --> 36:58.900
And I think really that's been about it.

36:58.900 --> 37:17.900
I've, I've got a few things on my, on my table, including the game I'm going to be playing after the stream tonight, which is Fantasian, I planned on starting it live first playthrough with with whoever wants to watch me.

37:17.900 --> 37:22.900
Curse at it loudly probably. So you're gonna go until midnight again tonight.

37:22.900 --> 37:33.900
I might go until I'm done with his makeup till. And who knows you may even like get a pause midstream and I come back in my pajamas and no broad no makeup.

37:33.900 --> 37:41.900
I'd be like, all right, this is this is time we get real dark soccer unplugged.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.900
All right, my pores unplugged.

37:44.900 --> 37:55.900
All right, so stay tuned for that after the show tonight for those of you that are here live Fantasian, I want to check a little bit of that out actually so I haven't played it yet but I want to so I'm excited to see it.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.900
Anything else you gave me we can want to share.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.900
Um, no. Then how about Loki.

38:00.900 --> 38:16.900
I played a bit of Orna which really got different recently they did an update that added like villagers or like some sort of people in a town like your areas that you take over you can actually build buildings and stuff like shops, which you could do before,

38:16.900 --> 38:27.900
but now they have like these different like a town hall and actual like houses that you can build to have people in them, and they will bring you things.

38:27.900 --> 38:40.900
I know there's a thing you can craft like potions and stuff, which I don't know why I would need to do that because I buy them by the thousands so I don't know why I would want to gather resources to make one, but whatever.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.900
That's the thing I guess.

38:43.900 --> 38:53.900
But yeah, so that that's something that they just recently added so I've been playing that quite a bit. Actually, last month I was able to get the final like reward is they give you like daily rewards if you play each day.

38:53.900 --> 38:58.900
And so I was actually able to get the one at the end of the month because I guess they played every single day.

38:58.900 --> 39:04.900
So I played that I played a lot of Minecraft.

39:04.900 --> 39:32.900
I published my first episode of my Let's Play series on the Collusion MC SMP server that I'm playing on right now so I released that. I'm pretty proud of that. So hopefully more of that will be coming soon I know I've started designing the shop I have that's going in the shopping district so I was working on that last night and it's been big farms like I built this massive gold farm in the nether roof.

39:32.900 --> 39:36.900
And so I've been working on that just the farm stuff.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.900
So it's, it's, it's fun.

39:40.900 --> 39:46.900
You forgot to go to my video, I was gonna say that plug plug that YouTube so that folks go subscribe to you.

39:46.900 --> 39:55.900
And of course, local are on YouTube. All right, check it out. Excellent. I tweeted that from the account to so our on Twitter if you want to get the link.

39:55.900 --> 40:02.900
Okay, my gaming week well Loki stole my thunder there I also played Orna, which I haven't touched and like a good you know we used to talk about that a lot on the show.

40:02.900 --> 40:15.900
I probably haven't touched that game in a good two or three months, but they did that massive update and I was like oh well let me go see what's different. Wow, lots of new things which again is very impressive considering it's just one person that you know really well I mean he contracts

40:15.900 --> 40:27.900
for the music and some of the design stuff and that but it's fine but it's essentially one guy man show yeah made most of the game. So it's pretty impressive but yeah there's all that new stuff that's kind of in that so that's that's been fun to look

40:27.900 --> 40:36.900
at. I still don't know like what like a lot of that is like I know that one of the potions I saw I didn't recognize but there's like one that's like, you know, you can get a.

40:36.900 --> 40:48.900
I don't know like a mid tier like health potion I'm like, why would I do that just buy one like it's for people who are starting it's a little harder to just buy stuff like, yeah, people that are already almost like level 200 build one of those houses that

40:48.900 --> 41:00.900
like or build one of the things that actually makes the, the potions it's like 5 million gold or something like for that you could buy like 10,000.

41:00.900 --> 41:10.900
I don't know why you would want to do that. So your base fortress or whatever no longer has quests, so you have to build the new thing the the town hall or whatever to get quests.

41:10.900 --> 41:21.900
And as you do those quests your morale goes up as your morale goes up your population goes up and they will, if you build the offering hall whatever it's called they will occasionally give you offerings, it's kind of like Actraiser in that regard.

41:21.900 --> 41:33.900
So, yeah, I've already built all that stuff and I'm going to be doing more of the quest but yeah it's cool to see some additional stuff. Yeah, it's it's it's reinvigorated the game a little bit which is what it needed because it was getting a little stale for me so that's

41:33.900 --> 41:42.900
oh and they added regional chat that's the huge things now there's global chat, and this is the shocking thing I was expecting to go in there and see like totally toxic stuff.

41:42.900 --> 41:54.900
No, it's like everybody's being super cool. And it's like oh hey I've seen you around where are you from hey where you know, which in a game where you do go around and take other people's areas and stuff nobody seems to care, which is a very pleasant

41:54.900 --> 41:58.900
feeling, unlike some other games I've played where people get very trolly and possessive.

41:58.900 --> 42:11.900
Mike finally. Yeah, exactly. It's like oh these people are real who knew. Alright, um, so besides just Orna, I've also been playing a Dead by Daylight of course, but I've made some good progress in that game I leveled back

42:11.900 --> 42:23.900
Bubba or Leatherface all the way to 35. And that is important because you need to do that to get barbecue and chili, it which is a talent of his that helps you track, you know I'm trying to try and explain this to the people who don't know dead by

42:23.900 --> 42:33.900
daylight, but it helps you track survivors basically. So you can see where they are on the map, just briefly, and it also increases your blood points which is like experience which used to level up.

42:33.900 --> 42:47.900
So it's a very necessary talent, and I picked that up and that felt very good so now I'm back and I'm playing Pyramid Head. I did my first Freddy match as well. Dark Sakura my murder sister has decided to buy me more DLC.

42:47.900 --> 42:56.900
Thank you. She picked up the plague I forget what that DLC is called but the killer is the plague or Vomie Mommy. You bought that for me.

42:57.900 --> 43:09.900
Devotion of the damned. Yeah, so I plague of the damned I don't know what it's called but anyway, I played that I played a Vomie Mommy match or two she's hard. Like, I did not see my frustration and learning her.

43:09.900 --> 43:17.900
Yes, because I did not realize as you're inhaling so she's, she's, she's called Vomie Mommy and you can imagine why.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.900
When you're inhaling to do your thing. Loki you're not muted.

43:21.900 --> 43:36.900
When you're inhaling to do your thing. You slow way down, and I didn't really realize that there are really, really good add ons to to offset that yeah we don't have that in your first or second game.

43:36.900 --> 43:48.900
Yeah, so that's taken pretty quickly. Yeah yeah so anyway so that's that's Dead by Daylight. We've talked plenty about that. The other game I've played this week, I'll talk a little more about.

43:48.900 --> 44:00.900
We actually did a special stream here on vog network on Friday night, I got my buddy Shane who was part of the definitive Pokemon ranking stream. A couple weeks ago here on the network.

44:00.900 --> 44:17.900
No actually that was last week God time, time flies. We actually spent some time playing Pokemon snap and doing first impressions of that game, because Shane had never played Pokemon snap before the first one that was on N64 he had actually never played that game.

44:17.900 --> 44:31.900
So, seeing this new one and he was cool enough to like not touch the new version, and actually watch it on stream with me. So we actually streamed it together on, on Friday night, and I had a lot of fun, I enjoyed it.

44:31.900 --> 44:45.900
It's a lot of the stuff you really enjoyed about the first game that very relaxing notion of going around and taking pictures of Pokemon, and stuff and having that evaluated it's it's it's not like a normal Pokemon game where you have to send them into battle

44:45.900 --> 44:57.900
and the first game doesn't have battling. It's like you're riding a Disneyland ride taking pictures, which is something people do anyway. So I like it it's a cute little diversion type of game.

44:57.900 --> 45:05.900
So yeah, check that out if you're a you're a subscriber here at the voice of geeks network. First off, thank you. Second off, you can check that out in the archives and watch that anytime you want.

45:05.900 --> 45:24.900
I will point out that was a special stream we just did as like a thank you because so many of you guys, especially in the past couple months, have been donating bits, subscribing, just showing the love when you don't have to so it makes us kind of want to show the love right back by doing more episodes, and many things that we don't necessarily normally do.

45:24.900 --> 45:41.900
So that stream was one of them. So big thanks to Shane for showing up for that. And I had fun with the game. And I played for a little bit after the stream as well I got to the jungle level and was playing that and I went back and did the first park level a little bit and was playing that and getting some new Pokemon.

45:41.900 --> 45:55.900
I think it's just a nice game to just sit down and play and like 10 or 15 minute bursts. I mean, yes, it takes a lot of time to go through and pick the right pictures you want to show to the professor but I think it's very, very relaxing to go through that.

45:56.900 --> 46:03.900
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says has he returned it to the store yet so spoiler alert on the stream.

46:03.900 --> 46:15.900
Shane didn't wasn't really into it, like he didn't think it was really for him probably because it isn't about the battling or some of that other stuff. You know the Pokemon is known for I think Shane wasn't really feeling the game for what it was.

46:15.900 --> 46:30.900
So knowing that question would come up I actually texted Shane before tonight's show, and I asked him, I said, What happened, did you, did you take it back to the store yet, or what happened and he said, I've yet to play it still sealed.

46:30.900 --> 46:37.900
So that I'd say that somewhere in the middle because he didn't take it back. He still has it, but he hasn't played it yet.

46:38.900 --> 46:43.900
I just said wow. Yeah. No, he wasn't really feeling it.

46:43.900 --> 46:54.900
So, I think it's great. But yeah, I also understand, you know, there's no shinies in it which is a huge thing for Shane because he's big and shinies. There's like 200 something Pokemon.

46:54.900 --> 47:06.900
So when you consider that you know there's almost 900 that are out there there's going to be some left out of the game that are, that's going to be a little bit upsetting but there's, there's a lot in there for me so.

47:06.900 --> 47:15.900
Yeah, so I enjoyed the game I and I think if you remember the first one on N64 whether you played it back in the day, or you bought it on Virtual Console on Wii or whatever.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.900
I think there's a lot to enjoy in this one as well.

47:18.900 --> 47:26.900
And I think it's just a nice chill game. And I would, I would play more I can see where the $60 price tag makes people nervous.

47:26.900 --> 47:37.900
But I really like that they have like the whole like fake Instagram thing in there, where you upload your pictures of Pokemon and people can like like them, it says not like they have to change the name, because I'm sure Facebook has like trademarks

47:37.900 --> 47:49.900
so they call it like, smiles, I don't remember what it's called sorry somebody in shadow correct me, but you have those types of metals that you get on pictures it's cute I think it's really cute.

47:49.900 --> 48:00.900
Let's see, actdeftinchat says no shinies and no oshwat family that's true. Meanwhile, I don't care about shinies and Vulpix and Ninetales are in the game so win for me. Yeah, so, and yeah, this one has boss fights.

48:00.900 --> 48:10.900
There's like a boss fight playing behind Loki right now. Live on Twitch where it's just basically a stage where you have one Pokemon, you're trying to get the best possible picture of.

48:10.900 --> 48:18.900
And I think that's kind of an interesting little twist on the mechanic too. So, and you get what you get to submit one picture at the end. That's kind of neat. So, anyway.

48:18.900 --> 48:29.900
All right, let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's happened around the industry this week or maybe discussion of some rumors of things that might be going on right Logan.

48:29.900 --> 48:32.900
I can see this happening.

48:32.900 --> 48:51.900
I can too. So, you know, with the popularity of Marvel which has been like at all time high. And with the past record of Netherrealm putting out like for example Injustice, and they also have the Marvel or the DC versus Mortal Kombat game as well.

48:51.900 --> 49:20.900
Could totally see them working on a Marvel fighting game which is the rumor, at least that they're possibly working on that. And there's been some tweets by Ed Boon that could or could not be a hint at that, you know, he talks about like having lost a year with the, you know, COVID-19 virus and everybody having to be, you know, working overseas and stuff he says it feels like it's returning from the Marvel blip, you know, it could mean something, it could be nothing, you know, who knows.

49:20.900 --> 49:26.900
But I could see them doing something along the lines of like an Injustice game or something, I think it'd be really cool.

49:26.900 --> 49:38.900
Yeah, Tiger Claw on chat his brain went exactly where mine did when I heard this Tiger Claw on chat says, Netherrealm has the DC license, what if they did a DC versus Marvel fighting game that they would never do that.

49:38.900 --> 49:49.900
Disney would never allow that. Yeah, and that's where I'm kind of like, unfortunately, that would be up to Netherrealm to determine because DC would have to sign off on that and Marvel would have to sign off on that and I could see where the hesitation would be for both sides.

49:49.900 --> 50:07.900
Although certainly my god if they can make it work that I think I who wouldn't want to see that maybe some people wouldn't want it to be by Netherrealm I could see that but who wouldn't the idea of a DC versus Marvel fighting game I think a lot of people would like to see somebody their favorite

50:07.900 --> 50:23.900
I could see a Capcom DC fighting game I think that would be pretty cool. Yeah, well there was a DC Mortal Kombat game that was. Yeah, I understand that but like, no, like a Capcom game though. Yeah, like along the lines of Marvel versus Capcom.

50:23.900 --> 50:52.900
Well, and the story also kind of brings that part of it up what about Marvel versus Capcom Does that mean that series is is done I mean, I know you know the infinite and all that it wasn't maybe as well received across the board as as MVC two but I think a lot of people were still hoping there would still be like another entry in the Marvel Capcom series because someone's making a Marvel game doesn't mean that they're not making a Marvel game or couldn't make a Marvel game I mean we just had a Marvel game come out from Square Enix.

50:53.900 --> 50:58.900
You know, Avengers, I don't think that necessarily writes it off.

50:58.900 --> 51:05.900
I'm going to chat for some other comments, active in chat says DC versus Capcom new age of gods well you never know, it could happen.

51:06.900 --> 51:22.900
DGRama S with a dream studio suggestion in chat I'd rather see Arc System Works, or Bandai Namco do a Marvel fighting game, they can add the comic feel of it, and I can certainly see the arcs, yeah I can see both those companies really with that request on that for sure.

51:23.900 --> 51:36.900
Tiger class says I think nether realm would turn out a really good Marvel fighting game with how those fighting games look cinematic and its presentation. Yeah, I think, because the whole multiverse thing I mean it would just be insane.

51:36.900 --> 51:48.900
Well, and the the injustice games are pretty good. I like them, they're they're neat. And I think you're right I think there could be an interesting like I could see where nether realm might make a cinematic universe type of game.

51:48.900 --> 51:59.900
Whereas then Capcom can kind of continue in the comic universe sort of game. I could see where the characters and injustice or injustice nether realms Marvel's injustice whatever the hell it is.

51:59.900 --> 52:14.900
If I could see how those characters might be based more off the movie personas, although, then you get into all the likenesses and having to pay the actors and actresses so might not be exact but I can see where they might do a take on the cinematic universe as opposed to the comic universe.

52:14.900 --> 52:27.900
It would just be a different style it'd be kind of like injustice where you know it's less. I don't think that's necessarily based on a cinematic universe or whatever but I know I'd like to see it I think it'd be pretty cool.

52:28.900 --> 52:38.900
Sjoan Hunter Matt in chat says really hope folks temper their expectations for nether realm fighting game. Keep in mind, Marvel is a Disney property, you're not going to see Captain America get his skull crushed.

52:38.900 --> 52:41.900
Sure, that's, that's not an injustice.

52:43.900 --> 52:46.900
But I hope folks understand it will be injustice light.

52:46.900 --> 52:52.900
Yeah, injustice can still get a little bit brutal but certainly none of those fatalities.

52:52.900 --> 53:09.900
Yeah, no, no, no, but I get what has shown him out is saying it would have to, it would have to be even less gritty than injustice I think for Disney to sign off on it but also look at the DC Cinematic Universe versus the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

53:09.900 --> 53:21.900
A lot of people have kind of dogged on the DC Cinematic Universe because it is too gritty. Overall, so injustice kind of just reflects where the cinematic universe is that I think that's my opinion.

53:21.900 --> 53:31.900
Well, I think when it justice was made they didn't really have much of a cinematic universe anyways it were we on the Christian Bale films and stuff like that around that time, I can't even remember I guess you're right they hadn't.

53:31.900 --> 53:45.900
Maybe Batman and Superman was a thing, but that might be as far as. No, no, there wasn't Batman versus Superman Yeah, it was pretty much just its own that that was the first for me is that Batman and Superman movie.

53:45.900 --> 53:49.900
I didn't like it. It's way before that. Yeah. All right, fair enough.

53:49.900 --> 53:59.900
Tiger class says they could do a multiverse type of story where there's a version of the Marvel Universe that's dark, and they have explored that in the comics before I suppose anything is possible, but I would think they'd want to tie into something

53:59.900 --> 54:08.900
with like, you know, the current like Loki, which is good not not our Loki but the Loki in the Marvel Universe which is going to be having his own show on Disney Plus very soon.

54:08.900 --> 54:14.900
And, you know, Wanda vision, you know all that stuff that's you know that's out there right now.

54:14.900 --> 54:15.900
We'll see.

54:15.900 --> 54:28.900
So, yeah, anyhow, I know I still would like to see it just because I think Netherrealm makes good fighting games. And even though I'm not super into the newer Mortal Kombat games just because the violence is a little much for me.

54:28.900 --> 54:38.900
I think injustice is a pretty solid franchise, so I'd be curious to see what they do with that. So, well let's talk about a different thing that's going on over in the house of Capcom.

54:38.900 --> 54:44.900
So Capcom in the not too distant past released the Capcom arcade.

54:44.900 --> 54:56.900
Capcom arcade stadium was what it was called that came out on the Nintendo switch. I know I picked it up and I for a retro collection I thought it was really solid it's really good dark soccer you and Dan picked that up as well right if I remember right.

54:56.900 --> 55:05.900
Yeah, yeah, and you guys enjoy that too I'm assuming because that's true. Oh, yeah, mostly, mostly, mostly Dan's been playing a lot of die mark I'm Laura.

55:05.900 --> 55:18.900
Well some news coming out in the past week that Capcom arcade stadium is going to come to more systems, not just the switch, it will be coming out for more platforms in May so it's going to be coming out for I think all the other ones PlayStation

55:19.900 --> 55:34.900
Xbox one and steam yeah so pretty much all the big ones coming out on May 25, and there are, there's talk that there will be new games that will also be added as well I think that's very exciting so I'm really glad that the template has allowed because

55:34.900 --> 55:42.900
I kind of wondered I was like you know they could just fit more games into this, and it looks like that is the way they're going to go they're going to add more games to the collection.

55:42.900 --> 55:50.900
We don't know what they are yet, but there is talk that those games are going to be coming. Now, on the, I don't know if this is exciting side of things.

55:50.900 --> 56:04.900
There's also some other modes that will be coming and invincibility mode. It allows you to just play through the games and you don't have to worry about ever dying, but you're all the quarters are fake anyway so whatever.

56:04.900 --> 56:11.900
The invincibility mode and the new frames that come with it will cost $1.

56:11.900 --> 56:14.900
So you have to pay for invincibility.

56:14.900 --> 56:18.900
So, yeah, I think that's interesting.

56:18.900 --> 56:33.900
Yeah, that just drives people to want to go to emulators right. I think it's interesting they threw in the frames with it to try to be like well we're charging for the cosmetics to as a little bit of a.

56:33.900 --> 56:35.900
Yeah.

56:35.900 --> 56:52.900
Okay, that's the display frames, set one. So that is coming out supposed to be 32 new frames though which okay. Anyway, I'm in a related note, another game retro thing that Capcom did recently was the ghosts and goblins resurrection.

56:52.900 --> 57:05.900
I believe you may have had your eyes on that that is also going to PlayStation four PC and Xbox one on June 1. So for whatever reason you haven't picked that up yet on switch, and maybe one of those other console speaks to you more.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.900
You can check that out on June 1.

57:09.900 --> 57:15.900
That's it ghosts and goblins is a good one at your household to did you pick this up the resurrection at all.

57:15.900 --> 57:28.900
Not yet actually, I don't know why Dan's been waiting on it. I mean, he's probably a little bit more of, you know, the ghosts and goblins fan than I am, because I mean honestly it's hard and it makes me scream.

57:28.900 --> 57:35.900
So, I think, I mean, I keep encouraging him to get to get it but he hasn't gotten it yet so whatever.

57:35.900 --> 57:46.900
Dark Tetsuya pointing out Capcom arcade stadium still has rewind built in so I he's like I don't know why would you need to do invisibility I think or invincibility excuse me I think that's a good question.

57:46.900 --> 57:59.900
Dark Tetsuya also says I am hoping one of the updates includes Black Tiger. That's my favorite from Capcom's early catalog Yeah, that would be nice to see some of the other, the ones that were overlooked from the back catalog will be pretty cool.

57:59.900 --> 58:13.900
Going back to the last story, a little bit, I would point out what Bobby Black Wolf says here saying, let's just have soccer I make the Marvel fighting game. How about letting, how about letting soccer I take a fucking nap.

58:13.900 --> 58:18.900
I have a feeling sake soccer I'd never wants to work on a fighting game again.

58:18.900 --> 58:20.900
And I you know why he's earned it.

58:20.900 --> 58:30.900
I'm making that up I don't know I'm not in his head but I let the man take a goddamn nap. Don't, don't, don't put him in the Marvel universe right now.

58:30.900 --> 58:34.900
All right, let's move on dark soccer we have for us.

58:34.900 --> 58:42.900
Well, it's the stadia news because I mean as we all know now I'm playing quite a bit more stadia.

58:42.900 --> 58:58.900
But they are adding a much needed search bar to the freaking web store, thank God, because you have to kind of scroll through all this crap I mean, how in the hell does a search engine, you know company.

58:58.900 --> 59:04.900
Certainly, search engine, not have some kind of search feature in their damn game store.

59:04.900 --> 59:23.900
So, now you can click on it and you can type in whatever you're looking for and also it seems to hint that there's going to be a Assassin's Creed of some variety being added to stadia.

59:23.900 --> 59:26.900
So, keep your eyes open.

59:26.900 --> 59:37.900
Well that is nice that finally the search engines game store got a search engine isn't that lovely. So that's the joke a lot of people are making this week and even Jason.

59:37.900 --> 59:50.900
The introduction of the show, I guess when you don't have a lot of games on your service though you don't need a search bar so I guess that's a sign that stadia is getting more and more games that's for sure so there's that yeah, I guess I have to watch my

59:50.900 --> 59:55.900
jokes and and stuff with stadia because dark soccer is actually playing on it.

59:55.900 --> 01:00:03.900
It's, it's saved my, my tail, you know I have it keeps me in the game it makes me really happy. All right.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:16.900
It's definitely better than I thought it was over all of the technologies great like yeah it's just the whole you know the bandwidth caps. By the way, we did exceed our bandwidth cap last month in this house do you want to you want to hear the funniest part,

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.900
we exceeded our bandwidth cap, ready for this by nine gigs.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.900
Geez.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:36.900
I hate it that's, it's ridiculous. Well, you get one month waived or whatever but it's like at the same time I'm like well let me pay the fee this month when we went nine gigs over, and then give me, give me the free month.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:46.900
When I decided to go on an Xbox in November when all the new games come out and I go on a downloading binge go on a gaming vendor. Exactly. So it's just it's just ridiculous there shouldn't be a bandwidth capital.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:01:01.900
Well, they are like unlimited data now to like you can pay for that. I think that's what we have is like $100 a month though in it. Yeah, really high. Yeah, so it's, I think we pay like some like 75 bucks for our whole package.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:08.900
The overage fees max out at $100 anyway, so it's a little, little silly.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:23.900
That's really nothing. It's really isn't so. All right. But, you know, I mentioned on the show before Alan and I are trying to look at relocating. That's something we've been working on so, and the part of town we're relocating to actually has options there's competing

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:36.900
internet services so maybe we won't have to worry about bandwidth caps so much in the future. I haven't looked at what the rivals offer though. All right, moving on. Let's get to our next story which I think is Loki's.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:52.900
Yeah. So, Microsoft is actually taking I don't know if they're, they're doing this because of epic but they are also cutting the rev share from their storefront from 30% to 12%.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:02:08.900
Now, it's right now it's I believe PC games launching on their Xbox storefront will be able to earn more money that way. I don't believe this applies to their actual Xbox storefront that's on their console.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.900
Not yet.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.900
It's just the the PC, Windows Store I guess.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:26.900
It's rumored for the Xbox, but nothing concrete about when that's going to happen. And it would also it would be a logical step certainly. So but nothing concrete on that yet.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:39.900
Yeah, so we'll have to wait and see what happens with that I don't know if the Apple epic lawsuit has anything to do with motivation for this stuff because we've been seeing kind of a lot of different moves that kind of tie in with that.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.900
Yeah, but I don't know.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:55.900
Bobby buckles and what's good for developers, Bobby black woven chat says they came out and said it's not coming to Xbox I took it to kind of be interpreted as nothing's confirmed at this time, like, it might still happen in the future, I, I, I don't think

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:08.900
we will not be updating the revenue split for console publishers are the insane thing that that isn't a definitive no not ever to me, but at the same time we shouldn't run with it is coming to Xbox just, we don't know yet.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:22.900
But I don't know I just, I have a hard time believing it never will, but you're, you're also right in that it's probably waiting to see what comes out of some of these other legal things going on right now because it's not, you know, you've got that

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:31.900
Apple and epic thing going on, you've got the anti trust going on for not just Apple but Facebook but Google, you got a lot of tech companies under the microscope right now.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:42.900
I think Microsoft might actually be involved in that too I can't even fucking keep track anymore. So you have so much tech that's under the microscope right now that I could see where Microsoft's kind of waiting on some of that to see where they need

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:56.900
to move accordingly, but I would say it's, it strikes me as a, it's not a never ever sort of situation, but I suppose nothing is in this industry right so well they will want to like make promises they're not going to keep.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.900
Yeah.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:10.900
So, Bobby lack of does point out that we know about this because of the epic Apple lawsuit it's part of the evidence that has been entered into this entire class says, calling it the Apple epic lawsuit strikes me funny.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.900
It's going to be anything but epic lol.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:27.900
Well, tomorrow's gonna be a big day let's just say that, of course we're taping live on Sunday night, Monday is when all that stuff is going to be in court. I, you know, I'm not a lawyer and I don't even watch Law and Order so I'm not going to sit here

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:34.900
and try to say what I think ought to happen or what should happen. All I'm going to say is, it's going to be interesting. That's it.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:44.900
So, especially to see what what comes as a result of that. All right, let's move on, let's get into a story about among us.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:54.900
You know which was huge on Twitch for quite some time and it's still it's still around but I don't see it as often as I used to.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.900
It's still, it's still popular just I don't think it's necessarily on our radar. Yeah.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:09.900
Well, you know, something that's only going to help it grow is this story about how among us is going to be coming to PlayStation four and PlayStation five later in the year.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:23.900
This came up during a state of play, a little kind of like Sony's little version of Nintendo directs they did their own little PlayStation direct this week, and they confirmed that among us is going to be coming to PlayStation four and five later this year.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:36.900
It will have cross play capabilities so many get to cross play on other platforms with your friends, but it also comes with a platform exclusive skin, it has to do with the Ratchet and Clank franchise, so you get your own little Ratchet Clank skins in the game,

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:52.900
which considering the focus of the state of play they were showing a lot of the new Ratchet Clank game. With that it makes sense that that kind of ties in there. So, yeah, I don't think we did we get a date on that I don't think we did we just got a later this year so we don't know when.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.900
It is also supposed to. It's also supposed to hit series x and s on the Xbox side of the house.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:12.900
Later this year as well but we also don't know the exact day when that is coming either. It should be noted that among us got a big update recently. If you haven't been paying attention, the airship map launched relatively recently.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:21.900
So, yeah, like a few like a couple months ago. Yeah. So, all right, let's move on and talk about our next story.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:30.900
Yes, this is a very good news for people who like to collect, you know, physical versions of games.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:48.900
There is, of course, the Castlevania anniversary collection for PS4 and Switch, and now pre orders for the physical collection is going to start on May 14 at 10am Eastern time just before the new Netflix season starts.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:54.900
And you get four different editions see there's a standard which is just the game.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:04.900
There's a classic one that has the game soundtrack on CD or reversible poster, and a retro style does leave.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:23.900
It's also in metallic ink and then the bloodlines edition, adds to this, the, an 18 by 24 inch poster in a deluxe clamshell and then finally the ultimate edition has the soundtrack the poster.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:30.900
And actually the artwork is done by Tom Dubois who did a lot of classic Konami game artwork.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:53.900
Shadowbox that has light and sound steel book collection of mini replica boxes dust sleeve box art prints of the original. The first three Castlevania games, an enamel pin, and a physical version of the history of Castlevania, which I know I might have to have to pay money.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:08.900
The only thing I'm bummed about is that it didn't happen like months ago, because that Castlevania collection has been out a little while. So it almost seems like this is a bit late for this to be finally happening, but at the same time, you know, they've really gone all out with this

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:14.900
like I think it's really cool they're getting the actual artists that did a lot of that Konami box art to actually participate with this.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:18.900
175 bucks. You still kind of want it though, don't you?

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.900
Kinda, I super want it.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:28.900
I understand, I understand and a lot of classic Konami fans are going to want it and Castlevania fans.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:33.900
And this is all you get when it comes to Castlevania anymore so.

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:51.900
I mean, this thing is, so the games that are on it, I mean, just to recap for those who haven't played it is Castlevania, Castlevania II Simon's Quest, Castlevania III Dracula's Curse, Super Castlevania IV, Castlevania The Adventure, Castlevania II Belmont's Revenge, Castlevania Bloodlines, and Kid Dracula, which I love Kid Dracula.

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.900
But that was, that was on sale on the PlayStation 4 over the holidays for 15 bucks.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:01.900
I know, but some people like to have, you know, light boxes and art books.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.900
Yes, yes. And dishes and spoons.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.900
And dishes and spoons. Don't judge me.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.900
I get it. I get it. Why can't it come, why can't it come with a whip? That's what I want to know.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.900
Shouldn't you know that I have a whip?

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.900
What about, is it a Castlevania whip?

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.900
No, it's an Indiana Jones whip that I bought at Disneyland.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.900
It can be a Castlevania whip.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.900
I didn't know Disneyland.

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.900
Technically, Kristen bought it for me.

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.900
Hold up, Disneyland sells whips?

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.900
Yeah, they have Indiana Jones.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.900
Right across from the temple of the...

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.900
Y'all, I'm aware that there is Indiana Jones at Disneyland.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.900
That part I get. I just, I didn't know they sold weapons at Disneyland.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.900
That's news to me.

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.900
They, of course, sell weapons at Disneyland.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:44.900
That's the first place I would go to find weapons.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.900
So, side story about that.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.900
The day that Kristen bought me my hat and my whip,

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:57.900
we also bought giant snakes and we saw snakes on a plane at the theater at downtown Disney wearing snakes.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.900
Oh my God. All right, the end.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:10.900
Anyway, yes, they should have a Castlevania whip and they should have Castlevania official holy water.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:15.900
If it was the Castlevania whip, though, you know it would be made out of steel chain.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.900
Yeah, only the good stuff.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.900
I'm fine with that.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:23.900
It's expensive and then, I mean, it's practically a meteor hammer is what it is.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.900
All right.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.900
Watch my enemies.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.900
Something, something in my second amendment, I think.

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.900
You know, metal whips.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900
I'll call the gun.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.900
It is an armament.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.900
Yes, they, yeah, the right to bear arms.

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.900
The government's trying to take my whips.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.900
They could be medieval weapons of death.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.900
That's it. I'm traveling. I'm going to open carry a morning star.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.900
There's no laws against it, right?

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.900
There are no laws against open carrying a morning star, I think.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.900
There you go.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.900
All right, before this gets really weird, let's move on to our next story, Loki.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.900
It can always get weirder. It's fine.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.900
So, sure, sure.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:14.900
With the story about whips, now let's do a story about Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:21.900
How about she's a resident evil village had a demo recently, and it was a time demo.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.900
This now a time demo that could work if it's on consoles.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.900
But if it's on PC, you really don't have control over the time demo on that.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:43.900
So that's what happened is folks figured out that this time demo that was really only going to be 60 minutes originally was now people found a way to reset that timer so that they could play longer

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:48.900
or play, you know, longer than the intended time.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:53.900
Capcom then later on came out and extended the time even more.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.900
But, you know, folks said, who cares?

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.900
I have a way to do it as many times as I want.

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:04.900
So I don't understand what the point of making a limited demo in the first place.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.900
It doesn't make any sense to me.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.900
Well, because they don't make money off the demo.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.900
They make money off of you buying the game because you got just the first hits free.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900
That's what it is.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.900
Yeah, but like what if you didn't get a good impression of the game the first time you played it?

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.900
So that's it.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.900
Ask the creators of Ni No Kuni.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.900
I don't know what to tell you.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900
That's very stupid.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.900
Nintendo does the same thing.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.900
They have their like 30 demo.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.900
You play this demo 30 times and that's it.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:38.900
Sometimes folks want to like are excited about a game and they just want to play the demo over and over and over again until the full game comes out.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.900
Like I did with Saints Row.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:47.900
But sure, let's just poo poo on the fans like that and limit things, make it more difficult.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:53.900
Well, it is very silly that they released that on PC with the timer as if it wasn't going to get hacked.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.900
I mean, that's just begging for it.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:00.900
I mean, this is the biggest like non-surprise story of the entire year.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.900
Like, oh, a time demo was released and instantly hacked on PC.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:11.900
I'm sure it's been hacked on consoles too if you've done other things to your console to allow you to get in there and mod it for it.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:15.900
It's just not as easy as it is on PC, which is an open platform by design.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.900
Pretty much, yeah.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.900
SSG100Matt in chat says, you get to watch for free. Touching is extra.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.900
Yeah, it's that whole thing.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900
Let's see.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.900
OrangeRide in chat says, don't want people to play the demo and think, yep, this is good enough.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.900
See Doom's shareware version.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.900
Well, that was, I mean, I do get that.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:38.900
A lot of people only ever played that shareware version and that was Doom. That was it.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.900
They didn't realize, wait, there's an episode two and three. What?

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.900
And four.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.900
I think there was a four as well. I can't remember.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.900
Some of them had six. Some of them had four.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:53.900
Because Wolfenstein 3D was like the first big, big game I remember like that.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.900
I think that had six episodes.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.900
No, it was four, I think.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.900
No, it had six because I remember, okay, here's what I remember about Wolfenstein 3D.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.900
It wasn't even the Wolfenstein 3D. It was the Mortal Kombat mod somebody made for Wolfenstein 3D.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.900
And then you actually got to fight like Scorpion and stuff at the end of the level.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.900
It was just graphic mods and things like that. It was silly.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.900
Those are always the fun things.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:20.900
Yeah, Bobby agrees with me. There were six episodes of Wolfenstein.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.900
Doom may have only had four. I think you're right on that.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.900
All right, anyhow.

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.900
Let's talk about a game that didn't have enough for the price that people paid for it.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.900
Super Mario Party, I don't know. It had enough for some people.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.900
But there was a lot of people, I think, that played that game wondering,

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.900
why can't I play Mario Party online?

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.900
Like, the year is 20, actually probably 2020, I think, when this came out.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.900
It's 2021 now. Why can't I play Mario Party online?

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.900
Well, guess what? Nintendo came out this week and said, you can.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.900
You will be able to play Super Mario Party online.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.900
Now, to be clear, I'm talking about the full board game experience

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.900
because, technically, when Mario Party launched,

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:07.900
it had a Mario-thon mode where some of the minigames were playable online.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.900
Somebody's going to correct me if I don't correct myself.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.900
But a new update is out that is giving Super Mario Party a bigger multiplayer experience.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:21.900
Up to four people can play the classic board game or the team-based partner play.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.900
Seventy of the 80 minigames are available.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.900
I'm not sure why ten were left out, but I'm guessing they were things

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.900
that don't do well with lag or internet and things like that.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:36.900
Those games were only good until March 31st, so unfortunately they had to be cut.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.900
That's right, that's right. Mario is no longer selectable.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.900
Really, the only reason this game's getting published is because Luigi's in it, so it's fine.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.900
It's actually now Super Luigi Party.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.900
You can actually mix and match online and local. That's pretty cool.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.900
All this shade we're throwing aside, that part's pretty cool

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.900
because that means you could have two people in one place versus two people in another.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.900
That could be pretty cool.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.900
You will have to have a Switch Online membership to play online,

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.900
but that is now the norm in Nintendo, so there you go.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.900
But I think it's very interesting that it's all this time after the fact,

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:16.900
and it is a free update, so as much shit as we give Nintendo, let's give them this.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.900
This was not something they sold with the original game,

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.900
and people dogged them for it.

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.900
Here it is a year later, they've released it.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.900
What do y'all think?

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.900
Should we be applauding Nintendo, or should we be saying,

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.900
you really should have thought of that nine months ago, Nintendo?

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.900
I don't know, I'm kind of torn, because I think it's great.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.900
Nintendo does have a pretty good track record,

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.900
especially when it comes to some other people in the industry like EA,

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:49.900
of supporting games quite a while after launch with very robust DLC,

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.900
surprise patches such as this, and what we saw with Mario Maker,

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.900
and things along those lines.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.900
I think there are some things where we should be cheering Nintendo,

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.900
and that's great things, but this is really one of those things where you're like,

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.900
why now? This took a long time.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:10.900
But hey, they could have saved it for Super Mario Party 2, and they didn't.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.900
Yeah, I guess, but I mean...

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.900
Oh god, ActDef points out it's actually two and a half years.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.900
Oh my god, I thought it was a year old.

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.900
The pandemic has fucked with us all.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.900
I thought it was only a year old game.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.900
Okay, it's a two and a half year old game, so now...

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.900
Do they even sell it anymore?

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.900
Oh, I'm sure, oh yeah, online, of course.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.900
Even though it had Mario in it, they did not pull it on March 31st,

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.900
so you can still buy it on the eShop.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.900
In fact, when I went in to buy Pokemon Snap,

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:45.900
Target still had a copy of 3D All-Stars, and I would bet a lot of stores still do, so...

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.900
Oh yeah, like the one Target I go to frequently,

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:54.900
they still have like 10 or 15 of those gaming watches still.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.900
Oh wow.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.900
Like, they were off the shelves for a long time,

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.900
and then their last shipment, everyone's just like,

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.900
nah, I don't really need that.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.900
And so they've been sitting there.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.900
I'm waiting for them to get discounted.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.900
Act F says the release date was October 5th, 2018.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.900
My god, I honestly thought it was a year ago,

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.900
but what is time in this pandemic anymore?

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.900
So, cut me some slack.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.900
Alright, but there you go.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.900
That feature coming to Mario Party after all this time, so...

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.900
Maybe, and you know what, Loki?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.900
You know, you kind of say, is the game even available anymore?

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.900
Maybe this is something where it's gonna encourage another printing of the game,

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.900
and they're gonna put it back on shelves with this whole tag,

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.900
so it's almost like you're putting a second life into the game,

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:42.900
because usually games sell what they're gonna sell within the first 30 days.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.900
You know what I mean?

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.900
Like, it makes its biggest impact.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.900
It's splashing those first 30 days.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900
It makes the legs longer.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.900
Yeah, and then it's a slow burn.

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:54.900
But now it's like another kind of like sales spike

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.900
that they could get away with with this by putting it back out there saying,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.900
now available to play online.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.900
Which, you know, maybe...

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.900
I didn't even really think of this when I first read the story,

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.900
but it would make a lot of sense.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.900
Maybe the pandemic played into that.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.900
Because you can't, you know...

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.900
Even though now that the vaccine is out and we have that guidance

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.900
that, you know, vaccinated people can hang out in small groups,

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.900
which reminds me, Dark Sakura, we need to like hang out.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.900
Like, we're both vaccinated.

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.900
Actually, Loki, we're all vaccinated.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.900
We haven't hung out yet.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.900
We have to do that at some point.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.900
But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, during this pandemic,

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.900
a lot of people couldn't get...

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.900
Well, and the situation is not the same in Japan.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:37.900
You know, we're seeing like the Universal theme park has closed again

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.900
and, you know, things are in a different situation there, for example.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.900
So maybe the pandemic caused this to happen

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.900
because you can't exactly invite your friends over to play Mario Party

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.900
in all parts of the world right now.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.900
So that could be...

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.900
I didn't really think about that, but I bet that plays into it.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.900
So, all right.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.900
I would imagine.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.900
Anyway, where's the Twitch streams now of this?

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.900
This is the game I want to see AOC play.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.900
I want to see her and I want to see a Republican

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.900
in the House of Representatives.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.900
Listen, we don't need declarations of war.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.900
I want to see Congress people playing Mario Party.

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:18.900
That's what I want.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.900
Get AOC and get Ted Cruz.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.900
He'd be easy to beat.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.900
He'd just fall asleep.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:24.900
And you know what?

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.900
When the odds aren't in his favor,

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.900
he'll just leave and go to Tahiti or wherever it was he went.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:29.900
Cancun.

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.900
Cancun, thank you.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.900
He'll just go there and he'll be easy to beat.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:33.900
All right.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.900
Let's move on.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.900
SSG100Matt says, Or Vog?

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.900
Well, you're talking about me dropping $60 on a game,

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.900
but maybe for a bonus stream.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:44.900
Maybe.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.900
I have it already, so...

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:46.900
Oh, do you?

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.900
Then I'm going to come buy it.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.900
I'm pretty sure I'll buy all the Mario games.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.900
All right.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.900
Maybe.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.900
I don't think Bobby has it either, though, so I don't know.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:53.900
We'll see.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:54.900
All right.

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:59.900
ActDef says, I did actually see people streaming Super Mario Party,

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.900
but then Returnal and Pokemon Snap happened.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.900
That's true.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.900
Yeah, we didn't even really talk about Returnal this week,

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:09.900
and I'll just shout the game out because I am interested in it,

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:13.900
but unfortunately, just with stuff going on personally,

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.900
I can't really dump 500 bucks on a PlayStation 5 right now

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:17.900
if I could even find one.

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.900
I mean, I'd get Shane to help me because he knows how to do all that stuff.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.900
So I'd get him to help me.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.900
I am very interested in Returnal.

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.900
I want to play it.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.900
It looks really cool.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:30.900
Unfortunately, I'm just locked out of a PlayStation 5 right now.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.900
I imagine that is a similar situation for...

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.900
Well, Loki, you have a PS5, right?

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:35.900
No.

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:36.900
Oh, I thought you did.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.900
I have a Series X.

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.900
Oh, that's right.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:39.900
I can't even remember anymore.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.900
So none of us have a PS5 right now,

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.900
and odds are none of you do either because they're hard to find.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.900
I'm not really interested in getting one right now either.

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.900
Returnal I would play, but maybe I'll wait just a little bit longer.

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.900
Well, in reality, just because of things going on in my personal life.

01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.900
I'll probably get one this holiday

01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.900
because it's very likely to be some type of hardware refresh,

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:05.900
like a larger drive or a different color system

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.900
or something like that.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.900
They're going to zhuzh it up a little bit for this holiday season,

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.900
and hopefully they're actually available.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:11.900
So we'll see.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.900
All right.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:14.900
Questbuster in Chat says,

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.900
Best description I've heard of Returnal on streams

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.900
is that it's a cross between Contra, Risk of Rain, and Super Stardust,

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.900
which makes sense because it's the same studio that did Super Stardust,

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900
if I remember right.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.900
So, yeah, very interesting.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.900
That sounds insane.

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.900
Yeah.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.900
It sounds awesome.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.900
All right.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.900
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.900
And every week here on the show,

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.900
DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:37.900
and finds a game that she thinks,

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.900
hey, listen up, you brats.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.900
Instead of your newfangled returnals and your Pokemon snaps from 2021,

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.900
you should check out this classic game instead.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.900
But I have to admit, DarkSakura,

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.900
you did a really weird game this week.

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.900
You did a really weird thing this week.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.900
Well, it's a fucking weird arcade game.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:03.900
Oh, I didn't catch that it was your flag.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.900
Oh, I'm an idiot.

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.900
OK.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:07.900
That's right.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:08.900
It's me now.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.900
Hello.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.900
All right.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.900
Well, then let me also state in a 2021 twist,

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:14.900
which I somehow missed,

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.900
DarkSakura actually picks an arcade.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.900
That's what, because I looked at it and I'm like,

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.900
is this 10 years old?

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.900
I don't think it is.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.900
OK, I get it because it's a different thing.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:28.900
OK, so she picks a weird arcade game to put on display for everybody.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:29.900
OK.

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.900
And this one isn't Japanese either.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.900
And a lot of us associate the weird ass arcade games with Japanese.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:37.900
So how about that?

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.900
I got out twisted.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:40.900
I got outplayed.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.900
DarkSakura just voted me off the island with this pick this week.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900
Good job.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900
All right.

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.900
What is it?

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:47.900
You were on third hook.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.900
Yes, I just went to third hook.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.900
There it is.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.900
I just.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.900
I don't get because I don't play Dead by Daylight.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.900
Well, maybe you should start.

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.900
All right.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:56.900
Here it is.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.900
The fucking weird arcade game of the month.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.900
DarkSakura, what did you pick?

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.900
The last bar fighter.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.900
Not to be confused with the Simpsons episode.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:15.900
So the last bar fighter has the distinction of being a kind of redemption game, you know,

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:19.900
but what you redeem is beer.

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:26.900
So it is a really simplistic fighting game.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:35.900
Basically, you start with putting your cups on the tray below the tap, which is going

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:46.900
to replace the the coin slots and pretty much, you know, once you do that, then you can choose

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.900
one of five different characters, all named after different big boss brews.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:57.900
It was done for the big boss brewing company as a marketing tool.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:08.900
Basically, you have like different, you know, very simple attacks.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:17.900
I mean, you'll get, you know, fire throwing and unicorn horn impaling and all kinds of

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:18.900
stuff.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:24.900
You have a character that looks like Misty Knight from, you know, Marvel.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:35.900
And but basically, the winner of the cup gets a sample of beer from a keg inside the machine.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:41.900
It's interesting.

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.900
And so it's actually called the beercade.

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:53.900
It's their first ever beer dispensing arcade game to offer an interesting way to sample

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:54.900
beers.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.900
And so that's where the last bar fighter comes in.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:03.900
It is actually developed from a flash based game.

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:11.900
Your characters are named Hell's Bells, Bad Penny, Angry Angel, Blanco Diablo and High

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.900
Roller.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.900
You've got, like I said, punches, kicks, unicorn butt slaps.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.900
You win the best of three rounds.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.900
You get a beer.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.900
I want beer.

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:28.900
Actually, I have soju in my fridge anyway.

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.900
But it's novel.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:31.900
It's novel.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:38.900
And it was a good idea as an advertising gimmick.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.900
It really is very gimmicky.

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:48.900
But how many people can say I beat my buddy at this fighting game and I got free beer

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.900
for it?

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.900
I mean, if anything, something like this could have caught on in other breweries.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:03.900
You know, they were missing a big licensing opportunity.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:10.900
But I mean, like, I would only play it if, like, the beer sample was a good beer.

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.900
Yeah, it's probably going to be a crappy beer that you get from this.

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.900
Well, it's there.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:16.900
It's a microbrewery is what it was.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.900
So the specific brewery had their their samples.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.900
Like, what if, you know, Pyramid or BJ's had something like that, you know?

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.900
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised the place downtown is gone, isn't it?

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.900
It is.

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:31.900
I'm surprised that coin up downtown doesn't have this, though.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.900
Well, but coin up isn't a microbrew.

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.900
True.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.900
They but they do offer a selection of local beers on staff.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.900
Yeah.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.900
But it's not going to be the same thing.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.900
Like they don't do beer flights or something like that.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:45.900
All right.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.900
This trailer is only a minute long and I've seen it three times now.

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:48.900
So I'm going to go to the video there.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.900
And to tell pod culture ultimate man cave.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.900
What's with the gendering of this?

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.900
This is a Jamie Cade.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:57.900
Jamie wants one in her house.

01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.900
So really, I just want some beer.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:02.900
All right.

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:03.900
I'll fight you for it.

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:04.900
All right.

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.900
I have a I think I have a sapro black in my fridge.

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:08.900
All right.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.900
There it is.

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.900
Your classic game of the week.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.900
The last bar fighter.

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.900
Good, good pick.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.900
You fooled me, dark soccer.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.900
I didn't even realize it was a flag, but it makes perfect sense.

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:20.900
All right.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.900
I fooled you once.

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:23.900
All right.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:29.900
Let's get to some rapid fire news and we'll quickly talk about some other things that are going on in the industry.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.900
Who's starting us off tonight?

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.900
I think Loki.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.900
Yeah.

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:42.900
So apparently Activision has even more studios working on Call of Duty now.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.900
Apparently, there has been some report of layoffs for Toys for Bob, but that's not actually true.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.900
It says there's not been a reduction in personnel recently at the studio.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:55.900
Development team is operating fully and has a number of full time openings at this time.

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:58.900
And this is a continuing support on Crash Bandicoot 4.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.900
It's about time and provide additional support to Call of Duty.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:09.900
As of right now, they have almost all of the Activision Studios are working on Call of Duty.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.900
So Toys for Bob are Toys for Bob is working on Warzone season three content.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:18.900
Raven Software has been a support studio for Call of Duty since 2010.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.900
Activision Shanghai is working on Call of Duty online.

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.900
Demonware is doing server support.

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:30.900
High Moon Studios is supporting Call of Duty as well.

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.900
Benox has been working on Call of Duty since Black Ops 3.

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.900
And Infinity War, Treyarch, Sledgehammer have been developing Call of Duty games.

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.900
So it's all Call of Duty all the time.

01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:53.900
And then as we were talking about some updates for Among Us, there's another popular game that's streamed on Twitch as well.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900
Fall Guys, you may remember that.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:03.900
It was supposed to be coming to consoles or more consoles, I should say, recently, including the Xbox and Switch.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:07.900
However, that has been delayed again.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:13.900
So now there is I don't think any update on when it's coming out.

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.900
But this is the delay gives our teams time to add features like cross play.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:26.900
So when we add new feature or so when we add new platforms, players will be able to stumble in harmony with their power, regardless of platform or choice.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.900
So that's what they're spending time on right now.

01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:34.900
But no word yet on one when we will see the game come to those consoles.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:41.900
All right, let's move on to Dark Soccer and what you have for rapid fire news.

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.900
I'm actually cheering some bits right now for our hype train.

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.900
Yes. Big, big, big thanks to you guys in chat for your generosity.

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.900
I'm always blushing. I love hype trains.

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:56.900
Yeah, it's it's and that also puts us on the front page of Twitch for a short period of time.

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:01.900
So I know I never know if anyone actually comes from the front page and lurks in Twitch.

01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:09.900
I never know if anyone actually comes from the front page and lurks in chat to see because what a what a weird thing this is because we're not playing any video game.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.900
We're just talking about gaming culture and video games and all that good stuff.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.900
So hello to any people in five different Discord channels when we start.

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.900
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:23.900
Yeah. You know, you know, that's that's the funny thing about you having the increased Twitch presence.

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:29.900
And that's probably one thing. I mean, you got to be careful because it's actually really tacky to promote yourself as someone else's Twitch channel.

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.900
But if someone asks, then it's yeah, it's a good way to get the word out.

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.900
Well, that's exactly it. But a lot of people have on their Discord now like promote your or when you go live.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.900
Yeah. Yeah. No, that is a that's a great way to do it.

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:46.900
Like the Dragon Con digital media track has something like that.

01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.900
And I know Bobby's really good about promoting on there, except I always flaw.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:55.900
I need to but I'm I'm doing a lot over here to get the show going.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.900
I need an intern. We need a new intern is what we need.

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.900
You know what? Because, you know, Drew, you're retired.

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.900
Drew Drew's like in his 30s now. He can't be an intern.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:09.900
Well, he can be, you know, Drew retired to be a cat dad ages, ages irrelevant.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:17.900
But I think we need a new intern that that will help promote on social media and all that stuff anyway.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.900
But then I feel guilty because I'm like, oh, but then you're asking someone to get paid and exposure and all that stuff.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:25.900
But at the same time, I'll pay you double what I make.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.900
Nothing. So it's a labor of love.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:34.900
That is it is what it is. So anyway, if anyone's like seriously interested in helping to do some of that stuff,

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:41.900
reach out to us at our online because that would that would actually mean a lot anyway.

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:50.900
In the meantime, so. So from from my rapid fire, Konami has said that they are not attending E3 2021.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:54.900
They even have any games. Can I finish?

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.900
Let her finish and you might find out.

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:03.900
Because they are in, quote, deep development on a number of key projects, end quote.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:07.900
They made a public statement on it. In fact, I'll read the statement due to timing.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.900
We will not be ready to present at E3 this year.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:13.900
We want to reassure our fans that we are in deep development on a number of key projects.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.900
So please stay tuned for some updates in the coming months.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.900
While we are not participating this year, we have great respect for the ESA.

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.900
We know that 2021 will be a great success.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:30.900
We will continue to support the ESA and wish the best to all participants in this year's show.

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:36.900
You get your answer, Loki. Ice skeptical.

01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.900
But yes, that was a very solid snake level grunt.

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:45.900
It's metal. You're confirmed.

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:49.900
I how many platforms are they bringing Frogger to now?

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.900
Yeah, it's all mobile games in development, I'm sure.

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.900
I will give this to SSJ100 Matt in our chat.

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.900
At least they're not coming with BS hype footage.

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.900
You know what? Let's give them that.

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:03.900
At least they're not coming to lie.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.900
So, let's all praise Konami for not lying.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:10.900
I guess is what I'm saying.

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.900
Let's praise them for the bare minimum.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.900
You tried.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:16.900
Alright.

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:25.900
Anyway, we know that Yoshinori Ono left Capcom, but you know what he left for?

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:31.900
He is the president and COO now of Delightworks.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:37.900
They're founder and president before Akihito Shoji.

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:41.900
Actually, I think he's retiring.

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:48.900
So yeah, Ono is now going to be the head honcho there.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:54.900
Good for him because he's such a pleasant person to see at a lot of these events like at E3 and things like that.

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:57.900
I'm glad that he'll still be in the industry.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.900
I've heard some weird things about whatever went down at Capcom.

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:04.900
I'm glad he's going to stay a part of this industry at the end of the day.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.900
He's just a joy to watch speak and things like that.

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:13.900
So yeah, that's all I have to say on that.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.900
Alright, that's it for Rapid Fire News.

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:19.900
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.900
Loki, we'll start with you. What's coming out in the US this week?

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.900
We got a few things.

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:28.900
So, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is coming to Xbox One.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.900
We've got Wreckfest on PlayStation 5.

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:36.900
Skate City on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:44.900
Resident Evil Village on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Stadia.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.900
And that's it.

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.900
Alright, traveling to Japan.

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:53.900
You know, oftentimes when there is a slow week on releases, I'm like, is it because it's Golden Week in Japan?

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:58.900
This is the week where, yes, it is Golden Week in Japan.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:05.900
However, there is one big release on the PlayStation 4 and 5 that's happening on May 8th, which I think is technically after it's over anyway.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.900
And that is Resident Evil Village.

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:12.900
But otherwise, it's a slow week and this is the week where Golden Week really is to blame for that.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:16.900
But I hope everybody in Japan is having a lovely week with all the holidays this week.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.900
Dark Soccer, how about the UK?

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.900
So, only a handful of things.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:25.900
On May 5th is Evergate for Switch.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:32.900
Also for Switch on the 6th is Pixel Puzzle Adventures plus Picto Quest Puzzle Bundle.

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:40.900
On the 7th, the Nintendo Switch Lite Blue comes out and also Resident Evil Village.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:42.900
Alright.

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.900
Well, I think we have some more stories to get into here.

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.900
So, we are going to get into our next story.

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.900
Loki, why don't you start us off here?

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:56.900
Yeah, so Sony has actually begun selling the PlayStation 5 in China.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:07.900
That's huge news because typically China hasn't really had game consoles there because of their lockdown and like I think these different electronic devices.

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.900
Or they do, they come out in different ways.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:14.900
Like the whole Nintendo Nvidia thing, right?

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:18.900
Nvidia Shield that had like, what was it, Wii U games?

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.900
You know, Wii games on it.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.900
Yeah, it was Wii games. It was like way after the fact.

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.900
But, you know, still it's, you know, there's a few people that live in China.

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:36.900
It's a very big, so anytime you have a big console release, it's a big deal because China is just such a large market.

01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:42.900
Right, exactly. So, it's going on sale here pretty soon.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:50.900
Looks like on May 15th is when that's planning on going on sale.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:54.900
They're going to have the digital only version and of course the disc version available as well.

01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.900
Hopefully scalpers don't eat that up.

01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:03.900
I don't know what the scalper situation is in China, but it's not good over here.

01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:11.900
Well, and certainly a lot of people are going to be asking, you know, well, wait a minute, how's that going to deal with the supply issues they're having in the rest of the world?

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:18.900
Well, I mean, you know, everybody should be able to play PlayStation 5, so I hope that question isn't coming up too much.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900
Right.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.900
But I'm sure people are going to be asking it.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:27.900
It's like, well, can't they wait to launch it in China so they can get some of those parts, you know, in other things?

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:35.900
But there also might be people that may try to import one to have a, but that wouldn't really work either, would it?

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:41.900
You can't just like switch a PS5 you buy that's intended for the Chinese market.

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:44.900
You can't just flip a switch and make it a North American PS5, right?

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.900
It's not going to work that way.

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:59.900
I don't know if that's necessarily the case, because I think, I don't think that they have those necessarily locked down for regions, but maybe.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.900
But the import, the importing costs would be crazy for one.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.900
Yes, well, it's the equivalent.

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:10.900
So like, for example, the disc version right now is the equivalent of about six hundred three US dollars.

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.900
It's thirty eight ninety nine one.

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:21.900
And then also the PlayStation five, the digital only versions about four hundred seventy nine dollars or it's three thousand ninety nine one.

01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:24.900
So.

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:31.900
It's I don't know, I right now, they're releasing like a few games available for that.

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:38.900
There it's three games right now, Sackboy, Ratchet and Clank and Genshin Impact.

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:42.900
I don't know if necessarily we're going to have a lot of people importing that.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:47.900
So I think that would make it, I don't know, maybe import if you can get it legitimately and import it.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.900
It might be cheaper than some of the scalpers out there. I don't know.

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.900
I don't know. No, I just wouldn't do it. Yeah, I wouldn't either.

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:56.900
I just wait for eventually it's got to be easier to find on shelves here.

01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:59.900
You just have to wait, resist the urge to buy from scalpers.

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.900
But since we're not in the holiday period, it should be easier to do that.

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:09.900
I think a lot of people that don't pay attention to those sorts of things are like, you know, parents that just have to get one for their kids and they don't care.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:12.900
They'll pay the scalper fees. But that tends to happen more around the holidays.

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:18.900
I mean, I guess birthdays can happen at any time, but that's why you see it happen so much more often at the end of the year, I think.

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:33.900
Yeah. All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about this interesting story, which has to do with Riot Games and something that they are doing for one of their game that they released, I think, relatively recently, Valorant.

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:49.900
They're going to be recording the voice communications in that game to catch people that are being very, very naughty, meaning, you know, things like racist and other things that just, you know, grow up and don't do those things online or anywhere.

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:53.900
So Riot has announced that they are going to be updating their privacy policy.

01:40:53.900 --> 01:41:03.900
They're going to record and evaluate reported player voice communication in Valorant, which I believe did come out some time ago, but it's an update to their policy in this.

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:20.900
In a statement, they said, in order for us to take action against players who use voice comms to harass others, use hate speech or otherwise disrupt your experience, we need to know what those players are saying, which is why moving forward, we'll need the ability to analyze voice data.

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:33.900
They have explained the way that this works. The company will not be actively listening to players. They're only going to record data if a report is filed, although I'm sure that's not going to stop a lot of tinfoil hat people from thinking a different way.

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:44.900
But at the same time, you know, Xbox Live could be listening to you, PlayStation, the Nintendo app could be listening to you if you want to believe any of those things.

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:58.900
Riot says when a player submits a report for disruptive or offensive behavior and voice comms, the relevant audio data will be stored in your account's registered region and evaluated to see if our behavior agreement was violated.

01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:05.900
I think it's more accurate that they are recording it always. It's just they're going to retain it if there's a complaint filed.

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:13.900
OK, fair enough. And so whether or not they find a problem, they will delete the audio after they review. So what do you guys think about that?

01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:20.900
I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to think I don't like them being nosy like that. But at the same time.

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:27.900
You know, you go into any business, any business, you can have the expectation that you're being recorded on a security camera.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:38.900
Right. Or just any service that you're using nowadays and even the ones that say they aren't capturing your data, they're capturing your data because they want to learn, you know, they could sell that information, too.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:46.900
They can anonymize it and sell like, you know, do searches like whatever about valiant or valorant players talking about, you know.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:51.900
Yeah. How many times have they mentioned Gfuel, you know, like important data.

01:42:51.900 --> 01:43:00.900
So, yeah. And I think I think they could already be, you know, using that data for things you don't want them to use it for.

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:06.900
So for them to use it to effectively moderate things, I think I don't I don't see the issue.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:14.900
I don't. In fact, I actually I dare I say I kind of like it because I feel like it's going to give some oomph to some of the things that get reported.

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:20.900
Not that I play Valorant, but yet or at this time, you never know. Sometimes I find games years later.

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.900
Hello, Dead by Daylight.

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:28.900
Well, it could also help with like false reporting because you may have folks that are just reporting something to get back at somebody.

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:32.900
Right. You know, this way they can validate that.

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:36.900
ActDeft in chat says I'm not totally OK with it, but I'm not against it either.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.900
And it's probably more focused to voice pattern recognition.

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:42.900
Yeah. I mean, I understand like where it's like this is a little weird. It does seem a little.

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:49.900
But, you know, at the same time, if you think about it, you're recorded in any business you go into in the world at the same time.

01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:56.900
And it's for very similar reasons that if you decide to start a fight, you're on camera and they'll be able to show that you did it.

01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:05.900
Right. So I think that's where my brain kind of goes with it and why I'm like, you know, and again, I'm like, if they wanted to record us now, they they already could be doing that.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:10.900
And, you know, I've talked about this and, you know, I know people try to say you're just making it up.

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:17.900
You're imagining it. And maybe I am. But it is awfully weird that I might talk about something and then suddenly it shows up as a Facebook ad later.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:23.900
It's just weird. It's why all the time, you know, and people say, well, it's because you searched for it.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:28.900
You know, you didn't realize you were searching for it or you tweeted about it and it picked up on the tweet.

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:38.900
I know there's just some it's it's it's it's that whole thing where I can't prove it's anything, but it's something.

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:46.900
That's what it is. Dijerama S in chat says, when I worked at NBCUniversal, all calls were recorded.

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:54.900
We had someone call the help desk screaming and yelling at one of us. They pulled the recording, checked it, and she was reported to her manager.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:59.900
You're right. Any time you use equipment that belongs at a business or a place you work, they can record.

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:05.900
If you use your work computer to look at porn, they'll know because they're watching.

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:11.900
So don't visit Pornhub on your computer. And now that I said Pornhub, enjoy the ad you're going to see later on today.

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:17.900
They never advertise that. You're right. They don't. They don't have to.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:23.900
Let's be real. Actdeft in chat says whispers tacos to Rob's phone.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:28.900
I I would be fine if my if I got nothing but tacos advertised to me on Facebook.

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:36.900
I wish it's the stuff that they show on Wish where you're like, what the fuck did I say to get that to show up in my ads or just like weird stuff?

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:44.900
Like the worst thing is like when I bought something like I went to a site and I bought the thing and then they're advertising me the same thing.

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.900
It's like I already bought that. Why are you you're wasting your time.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:50.900
It's like I'm not going to buy another LG fridge or something like that.

01:45:50.900 --> 01:46:01.900
It's like I've already own one. The fun wish one for me is getting like drag accessories like breastplates and butts and hip pads.

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:08.900
I'm like, I don't need any of that. I have that already. I came I came with it attached.

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:17.900
Bobby in chat, you know, try to be the voice of realism, saying if they were recording your voice and sending it up, either your phone battery would drain quickly or your data caps would be hit quickly.

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:21.900
And also, people would inspect the network packets and find the voice files being sent up to the service.

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.900
What if it's all happening on your phone? Your phone can dictate.

01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:28.900
Like if you open up the notes app and say, hey, dictate this message.

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.900
It'll it'll put it in text. Maybe it's not sending the voices.

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:38.900
It's just something. Their voice to text, voice to text stuff is pretty advanced now.

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:43.900
I doubt that they would be sending the actual, you know, recordings.

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:48.900
Yeah, something. That's why I don't have the Facebook app on my phone anymore. I don't need it.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:53.900
Also, I don't need it. Why do I need the Facebook app? I don't. I can just go to Facebook dot com on the Web.

01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:58.900
And even then, like I should I shouldn't need to live on Facebook that much.

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:02.900
You know, anyway. Yeah. All right. Moving on.

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:09.900
Dark Sakura, instead of our crazy conspiracy theories, let's talk about some very real deals, right?

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:14.900
Yes. Well, we know that May the fourth is coming up and we know that it sounds like May the fourth.

01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:19.900
So it's basically Star Wars Day. May the fourth be with you.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:25.900
So at any rate, of course, Lucasfilm slash Disney takes advantage of this.

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:34.900
So of course, you know, we we heard that Jedi Fallen Order is getting an upgrade soon.

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:40.900
You can get up to 70 percent off the standard and deluxe editions of the current versions of the game.

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:44.900
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Origin and Steam.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:53.900
And this is going for May 28th to May 12th and then also started on April 30th going through May 11th.

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:59.900
You can also get up to 50 percent off the EA Star Wars triple bundle, which is Star Wars Squadrons,

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:04.900
Jedi Fallen Order deluxe edition and Star Wars Battlefront two celebration edition.

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:12.900
There's also other ones listed in steam. A few of them were on Mac and I was tempted, but I resisted.

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.900
Resistance is futile. Oh, wait, that's Star Trek. Star Trek. When Star Trek Day.

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:23.900
Oh, wait, actually, that's redundant. We just had it. It was that they did the first they do it on first contact day.

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:27.900
I don't know if there was gaming sales, but they did all the Star Trek news that day.

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.900
So I guess I just answered my own question. We get is the resistance.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:36.900
That's true. The Rebel Alliance. All right.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:41.900
Well, it's it's cute that they they made an unofficial holiday of sorts out of May the fourth.

01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.900
So I think it's it's cute. Well, and don't forget Revenge of the Fifth. That's right.

01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:54.900
And it's a good thing to come out of those damn prequels. It's the one day I can post like my favorite meme, which is like it's a picture of the Dalek.

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.900
You post it with the text. It says, oh, my God, it's R2D2. I loved him in Star Trek.

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:04.900
Like it's that's like the one day you can post that meme. All right.

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.900
Oh, Rob. Oh, me. Moving on.

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:16.900
You Loki. Yeah, I'm hoping for like at least some season two of The Mandalorian or not.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:23.900
Season two, season three Mandalorian. Maybe you'll get a sneak peek. I'm hoping that's my hope.

01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.900
So anyways, we've got some it's the end of an era.

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:32.900
I mean, it kind of been ending for a while, but now it's officially dead.

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:38.900
So after the last official games magazine is having its final issue.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:45.900
So the official PlayStation magazine UK was the last official game company magazine.

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:50.900
And they have their final issue going out so very soon.

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:57.900
So. That's unfortunate. OPM actually started was it back in 1995.

01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:07.900
So it's been a while, but honestly, and this is going to sound horrible, but I thought all the magazines were gone already anyway.

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:12.900
Well, this but to be fair, this is in the UK, you know, so it's not something I exactly would see it over here.

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.900
Like I used to see this all the time. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was the thing.

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:22.900
I'm sorry, I'm thinking borders. But yeah, I'd always pick up like the UK ones.

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:28.900
I always like the better. Yeah. So but it's it's still sad, obviously, you know.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:34.900
I'm this retro gamer. Yeah. It's just a lot of the magazines just are going online.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.900
And it's just a reality of the whole print media, which is which is sad.

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:44.900
You know, I wonder if there will be some type of renaissance, though, just like we're seeing, you know, like limited run games,

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:47.900
you know, that will see some type of renaissance for magazines and books.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:56.900
I guess we do. We I feel like every other week I'm getting some type of thing on my email for some type of Kickstarter that's for a book,

01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:02.900
you know, or something that's a compilation of, you know, stuff for some video game or something.

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:07.900
So I guess there's always a renaissance in that regard. All right.

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:15.900
Well, last but not least, on our official list of stories for tonight, we have a story about shoes.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:19.900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shoes. These shoes are three hundred dollars.

01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:25.900
Actually, I don't get them. They're not three hundred dollars. They're one hundred and ten dollars expensive.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:32.900
They are official PlayStation five shoes. They are Nike's PlayStation five theme shoes.

01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:40.900
It's the PG five cross PS five. And yeah, there's a PlayStation five set from Paul George,

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:47.900
who in twenty eighteen kind of talked up PlayStation fandom while talking about a shoe that had lights and sounds linked to Sony's console.

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:54.900
So some Instagram pictures popped up that this PG five cross PS five.

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:59.900
And they actually say those on the little back kind of like hook things for like if you hang shoes up or whatever.

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:09.900
They show them a little back hooks there. They are on Instagram where they will go on sale later this month for one hundred and ten dollars.

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:14.900
There have been other PlayStation Nike collaborations that were very limited.

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:18.900
So, you know, you want to talk about scalpers. The shoe market's full of them, too.

01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:23.900
So look out. But good luck if you decide you want to get some of these PlayStation five shoes.

01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:31.900
They are cute. I mean, they have their blue, a very nice color and the little Nike swoosh, of course, and all that good stuff.

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:37.900
I wish they would light up, too, but I guess I guess that would make them cost three hundred dollars for real then.

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:41.900
So as they will on the second hand market, so it's fine.

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:46.900
Yeah. As you know, Matt is chiming in saying Adidas is coming out with Lego shoes.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:51.900
I didn't know that. That's cool. Do you actually happens when you step on?

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:55.900
What happens when you stick on a Lego? You pick it up and you keep it with your shoes get bigger.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:59.900
That's how you make heels.

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:02.900
You have to put the shoes together. Do they snap together?

01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:08.900
It'll be it'll be like I was at Lord Business in the Lego movie.

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:12.900
All right. Let's get to the part of the show where you guys can drive a little bit.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:19.900
It is our listener roundtable. If you guys have any comments in our chat, please put them in there and we'll get to some questions and stuff.

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:26.900
I believe we do have an email, at least one tonight over at participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place you can send your emails.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:31.900
And Dark Soccer will step into the gaming, not the gaming vault, but the well, maybe the mailbag is in the gaming vault.

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:35.900
I don't know where it's kept, but she's going to look at the mailbag and tiny bag.

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:39.900
OK, it's a very tiny bag tonight and pull out the emails again.

01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:44.900
It's one of those micro purses, except it's not in their maze. It's when someone got on wish.

01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:49.900
Again, that email address participate at Orange Laundry dot com. Dark Soccer, take it away.

01:53:49.900 --> 01:54:00.900
Our one email comes from Robert M. Is there any reason Midway or more accurately Warner isn't releasing arcade collections for modern consoles or PC?

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:05.900
You know what my answer is? I'm not fucking Midway.

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:09.900
I don't know. Was that it? The email? That's it.

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.900
OK. Well, of course, you're not Midway. You don't know.

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:18.900
But I bet I bet if he sent this email to Midway, well, Midway's not around, but you know what I mean.

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.900
But if he sent this email to Warner, who now has all the Midway licenses, I bet they wouldn't even reply.

01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:29.900
So I think he has to come to us that keep tabs on the gaming industry to try to figure out, like, why, why isn't this happening?

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:34.900
Why, why is Warner not, you know, it's not profitable. End of story.

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:44.900
They wait. They're going to wait right to the end and release something at the right moment financially for them to release it.

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:48.900
There you go. I think something still could happen.

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:53.900
You know, you got to track records like there have been what they're doing with it.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:57.900
Well, at least with some of them, they're releasing them as arcade one up cabinets.

01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:00.900
There is that. Oh, that's true. OK.

01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:06.900
Although I wish they would hurry up with really seeing San Francisco Russia as an arcade cabinet.

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:12.900
But yeah, I mean, I know like Rampage and I'm trying to think what other stuff they had.

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:15.900
I know Rampage just sticks out as one of the ones that they had there.

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:21.900
And you know what? It's not just those. It's the mini mini arcades, too. Like this one I have here.

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:26.900
This is a Ms. Pac-Man, which actually Ms. Pac-Man is a mid, wasn't Ms. Pac-Man a Midway thing, wasn't it?

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:32.900
Yeah. Yeah. So technically this is another way that they're using Midway right now is these mini, mini cabinets.

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:38.900
So they are licensing out the properties. And that's Loki. I wouldn't I would have thought of that, even though that's so obvious.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:44.900
So kudos to you. You're right. So those arcade one up cabinets and then other types of collectibles.

01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:53.900
And I want to say I've also seen like like joust like, you know, when they have those bundles, it's like pins, stickers, things like that.

01:55:53.900 --> 01:56:00.900
They sell it for the loot box things. I've seen that for Midway stuff as well.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:06.900
So I kind of think that's where they're putting their and Loki's right on with this.

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.900
That's where they're putting their properties right now. But I know the emailer wants to know,

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:15.900
where's my PlayStation for my PlayStation five Midway arcade classics collection?

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.900
I think that's what they haven't done one of those in like years. They haven't.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:21.900
Why not play it on a system that you actually have it for?

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:30.900
Well, there is that. But there's also, don't forget, the last thing I remember them doing was the Lego thing.

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:36.900
They had a pack in the Lego dimensions. They had a Midway pack.

01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:41.900
And you could actually play some of the classic arcade games in that pack. You remember that?

01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:45.900
That's the last thing I remember them doing. Yeah.

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.900
But that's no longer available either.

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:55.900
Well, no, unless you you might get lucky at a discount warehouse type, like a 99 cent store or something.

01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:00.900
But I think even a lot of those are long gone at this point. So, yeah.

01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:02.900
Looking at chat for some comments here.

01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:05.900
Dargesuya in chat says, I mean, I'd love to see a new collection.

01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:10.900
I think his best bet are the arcade one ups that have the Midway stuff on it.

01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:15.900
Excuse me. POGCULTURE says, still winning a Spy Hunter cabinet.

01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:20.900
Dargesuya says, the last collection for that I saw was on PlayStation 3 360.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:26.900
I don't think they did them on 360. I think you're thinking original Xbox and PS2.

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:32.900
Because I'm almost positive I've got one of those collections just off camera over here.

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:37.900
And it's an original Xbox. If they did any of those on Xbox 360 have been Xbox Live Arcade.

01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:39.900
I don't think they actually had a collection.

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.900
And that's what I was going to get to. They were piecemealed.

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.900
One of the very first Xbox arcade releases was Joust. Remember that?

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:48.900
And then there was Robotron 2084.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.900
And a lot of those classic Midway titles followed there.

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:55.900
So that's what you got on 360.

01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:58.900
And I think some of those came to PlayStation 3.

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:00.900
And that's probably what Dargesuya is remembering.

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:07.900
Are those piecemeal like onesie twosie games that you could buy there.

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:10.900
But yeah, they had some really bang up collections.

01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:13.900
There was the Midway arcade collections one, two, and they did do a three.

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.900
Three was harder to find and it was all racing games if I remember right.

01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:18.900
Was that Hydro Thunder and that stuff?

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:25.900
Yeah, it did. Because I had it. I actually had a PC version of it. I got it free.

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.900
So they had like Hydro Thunder. There was San Francisco Rush.

01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:33.900
I don't think they had Off-Road Thunder, which is too bad because that game is awesome.

01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:40.900
God, I can't remember what else. I don't know if Rush 2489 was in that. It may have been.

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.900
Okay, I stand corrected. There was a collection on 360 and PS3.

01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:54.900
It was called Midway Arcade Origins. I guess it never crossed my desk.

01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.900
Okay, fair enough. Y'all got it. That's why we have a live chat.

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:04.900
Y'all got me. S2 and Hunter Matt says, we're beating around the bush here. Just bring back game room.

01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:06.900
Solves all the problems.

01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:09.900
I wish. That would be amazing.

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:12.900
I don't know. I think maybe the tides passed for that sort of thing though.

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:14.900
No, it's never, never passed.

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:20.900
I want an arcade one up that has that type of thing built into it. So I don't have to buy like seven cabinets, you know.

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:30.900
They have, you know, I thought that there was like another company doing something similar that where you could purchase games, but maybe not.

01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:36.900
Okay, ActDeft points out the collection is compatible on Xbox One. That's interesting.

01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:40.900
That means it plays on Xbox One S as well and X. So that's it. Maybe I'll have to check that out.

01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:44.900
So I guess there's your very long winded answer to your question.

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:49.900
You got to have backwards compatibility and go all the way back to Midway Arcade Origins.

01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:53.900
But will they do a new collection? I don't know. It's hard to say.

01:59:53.900 --> 02:00:00.900
I think I think right now it's more about they're making a lot of money in the retro cabinet space, whether it be large cabinet or tiny cabinet.

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:03.900
And I think that's where they're going to stay for a little while.

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:09.900
So. All right. Let's get into any other last minute stories. I don't know if Loki has anything else.

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:13.900
And of course, if you guys have any comments, put them in our chat room.

02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:18.900
Also, one more shout out for the mailbag. Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com.

02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:23.900
I do have one thing. So Epic Games has purchased ArtStation.

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.900
So it's a website I think Digital Arts can use to share their artwork that they have.

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:33.900
And now they have apparently there's like a commercial element to that.

02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:39.900
I think they're going to be tying that with Unreal Engine to provide art assets or something like that.

02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:47.900
But interesting to see that be purchased by Epic Games.

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:51.900
All right. So somebody said something in chat. I got to go back to the Midway thing because this is huge.

02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:57.900
I totally forgot about this. OK. S2100 Matt in chat says, speaking of which, what's going on with the ant stream?

02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.900
Is it still going on and strong? And the answer is, yeah, it's still going.

02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:06.900
And by the way, do you know what game they just added to ant stream about two weeks ago?

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:12.900
Joust. Huh. So my dumb ass forgot that.

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:16.900
That is another place where the Midway games appear to be going.

02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:21.900
Oh, yeah. Because Mortal Kombat got added to the service like a while ago.

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:27.900
So a few of those are showing up on ant stream. But it is weird because ant stream.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.900
If I remember right in chat, correct me if I'm wrong. I Kickstarter backed ant stream.

02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:36.900
So I'm able to use it. They still don't have an Xbox one X client, though, which is sad.

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:39.900
I can only do it on PC. And that is weird to me.

02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:42.900
I don't know why they don't have a one X client when they have an Xbox one client.

02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:45.900
I thought everything should automatically run, but for whatever reason, it seems weird.

02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:50.900
It is very weird to me. But.

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.900
Ant stream, I don't think is still available in the US.

02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:58.900
I think it is still only a UK thing unless you were a Kickstarter backer like me.

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:04.900
Hmm. I could be wrong. And that's why I need chat to help me out, because my my perspective,

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:10.900
I don't know, because since I was a Kickstarter backer and my my two years finally runs out like next month,

02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:16.900
I think, and I probably will re up for another year. So we'll see.

02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:19.900
Bobby Blackwell says my accounts disabled now. The Kickstarter is only for two years.

02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:28.900
Mine was also for two years and I'm still active. So I think it dies in June, if I remember right.

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:35.900
They added Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back on May the fourth or it's coming.

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:41.900
They added root beer, tapper and xenophobe. Root beer, tappers, another midway game.

02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.900
I'm just looking I'm looking at their discord. I have their discord on my phone.

02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:48.900
There's joust that they added not long ago. What else did they add?

02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:53.900
Marble madness, space war. So they're still they're still going along there.

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:57.900
Elevator action returns. Oh, that was always there. That's a tournament they're talking about.

02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:02.900
Rampage rampage they added not that long ago. So there's another answer.

02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:08.900
So and stream is picking up some of those midway classics. Interesting.

02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:13.900
There you go. There you go. All right.

02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:17.900
I don't see any other comments in chat. Bobby says the two years ran out a while ago.

02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:20.900
I swear I just played not that long ago and I was still able to get in there.

02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:24.900
I thought it was a June thing. Yeah. S2M says it's still not in the U.S. yet.

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:29.900
I don't get that. It's weird that they have launched here. What's up with that?

02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.900
All right. You had to get in on the Kickstarter or else maybe I won't even be able to renew stuff.

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:42.900
Yeah. All right. So real quick, I was going to say that Castlevania resurrection that was supposed to be for the Dreamcast has been dumped.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:49.900
And it's available online now as part of the Sega Dreamcast info games preservation site.

02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:54.900
So you can check out that unreleased game. I watched someone playing through it.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:04:00.900
It was pretty amusing just that, like, there's complete lack of, like, falling animation in some places.

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:05.900
And you could just walk around and buy really early. Yeah. And like terrible collision.

02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:11.900
Otherwise, it was it was pretty funny. And then that same track playing over and over. It was a demo version.

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:17.900
Right. So. All right. Well, we're getting here towards the end of the show.

02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:22.900
So I was a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but it's a little bit I think because of the holiday week in Japan,

02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:28.900
we probably just don't have as much news that's been coming out. And plus E3 is, you know, on the horizon.

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:35.900
And even though you have all these companies that are doing E3, I still think June is going to be the month when we really start to see a lot of news.

02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:40.900
So that's going to happen sometimes. But I still want to thank you guys for tuning in and joining us this week,

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.900
whether you were listening on the podcast feed or you were here live with us on Twitch.

02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:48.900
Thank you so much for being here and supporting Orange Onch Radio and listening to the whole program.

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:53.900
Really appreciate you guys. If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, tell a friend or to help us spread the word.

02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:57.900
We are the show where every gamer has a voice. We need more voices here at the table with us.

02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:04.900
So tell a friend a tweet goes a long way. Auto hosts of Vogue Network on Twitch goes a really long way.

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:10.900
Let me tell you. And yeah, thanks again for your guys's support. I saw a hype train going on earlier during the show.

02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:14.900
You guys don't have to do that, but you do. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to work on creating content.

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:22.900
I will tell you what, just before the show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki, we're talking about another project we might take on very soon.

02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:27.900
Nothing that's going to be taken away from OLR. It's going to be something extra.

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:31.900
So we'll talk a little bit about that very soon. I think we're going to start that.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:38.900
So more to come on that soon. And this is directly a thank you for those of you that have really gone the extra mile with your participation.

02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:43.900
We want to create more for you guys. So and there's there's there's a few things we have to get off our chest.

02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:50.900
There's always some more things to talk about. So also, you don't have to support us financially.

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:55.900
But if you feel so inclined, we also have a store, Vogue Network dot com slash shop. Somebody just linked that in chat as well.

02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:01.900
And we appreciate that. So. All right. Bobby says he's limited to one game in a 24 hour period.

02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:05.900
So his account must have reverted. Shit. I guess maybe mine did, too. I don't know.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:11.900
I have to look. I don't know. I thought I thought it was extended to June because there was like a beta.

02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:17.900
I don't know. Whatever. I'll take his word for it. I mean, he's if he's limited, he's limited.

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:20.900
So that probably happened to me, too, because I don't think I did any more than two years.

02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:25.900
All right. Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for tonight.

02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:34.900
So I will start with Loki. Your final thought tonight. Final thought is I'm going to hopefully start working on episode two of my Let's Play series soon.

02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:37.900
So look for that. Sounds good. Looking forward to it.

02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:41.900
So while Dark Soccer and I have been doing more on Twitch, you've been doing more on YouTube.

02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:46.900
And I think that's great. Get get in fact, all are everywhere.

02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:51.900
All right. My final thought is, hey, killers and dead by daylight.

02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:57.900
Stop winning by slugging everybody and try to try winning without no Ed.

02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:01.900
All right. Well, I don't know. I have no Ed on Bubba, so I use it.

02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:05.900
It's such a nasty thing to go up against, but I get it.

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:09.900
I've used it, too. All right. But the slugging. Stop it. All right.

02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.900
Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought.

02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:18.900
Well, make sure that you stay in because I'm going to be going live after after the show.

02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:24.900
I'm going to be playing Fantasian. Because why not?

02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:34.900
And also, I have my own YouTube channel that I've just got a couple of things uploaded on.

02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:39.900
But it's just as Jamie Summers Dash Dark Sakura.

02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:46.900
I will link it in chat if if people are interested in it.

02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:49.900
But yeah, I am going to go ahead and hop off early.

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:54.900
I will not be here post credits as I am prepping to entertain you all with Fantasian.

02:07:54.900 --> 02:08:00.900
All right. All right. And and those that are on the podcast feed, this is going to be on your personal channel.

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:05.900
So if they do want to see this after the fact, they can go to your personal channel because you don't have your videos locked to subs.

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:11.900
So you can watch that after the fact. Right. Right. My personal channel is DarkSakura underscore O.L.R.

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:15.900
Cool. All right. There we go. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:18.900
We will see you next week and talk about whatever news comes up in the next week.

02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:22.900
Have fun gaming. Don't be toxic. Be nice to each other online.

02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:27.900
And we will see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio. Good night, everybody.

02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:57.900
Those of the staff of Orange Launch Radio or VOG Network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:00.900
See you next week.

02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:32.900
The.
