0	15200	You kids and your fancy M2 SSDs and your PlayStation 5s and your always on wireless
15200	16200	connections.
16200	19720	Back in my day we had to run a cable from the kitchen to the living room, wait 30 seconds
19720	25200	for a modem to dial, prevent anyone from being able to use the phone and suffer the consequences
25200	26760	if someone tried to.
26760	28560	And we liked it!
28560	30240	This is your Old Man Yells at Cloud Update.
30240	33440	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
33440	37640	this millennium's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37640	45320	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45320	47480	where every gamer has a voice.
47480	54460	It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 878 for this
54460	57100	August the 1st of 2021.
57100	63700	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you as always with my co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura
63700	64700	or Jamie Summers.
64700	65700	Oh, hi.
65700	66700	Hello, how are you?
66700	67700	Um, okay.
67700	75380	It's been a busy, busy day, I was woken up by the sounds of the neighbors running power
75380	76380	tools.
76380	77380	Delightful.
77380	82900	Oh boy, you gotta love power tools, love to hate them that is.
82900	86700	I wanted to use the power tools on somebody's head.
86700	93020	I have to go right to our chat room tonight because She-Hulk 10 is in there in chat and
93020	97460	we love seeing She-Hulk every week, but with this comment that I actually didn't realize
97460	103700	saying woohoo, MTV is 40 and that's right, that would be right.
103700	108500	Not that I questioned She-Hulk's trivia, but I had that realization of like, oh my gosh,
108500	112580	that's right because MTV started 1981, August 1st.
112580	114980	And I watched it when it aired.
114980	117940	I don't think we had it on our cable.
117940	119220	We had cable at the time.
119220	120220	Yeah.
120220	125940	Like, uh, and they were doing like some deal where you got MTV like with your package.
125940	127260	I barely remember this.
127260	128780	Mind you, I was like five.
128780	130500	Yes, I would have been three.
130500	133340	So maybe I just am too young to remember it.
133340	143300	But I remember my, my uncle, I think turning it on to see what it was and watching the
143300	149340	first music video that they played, which, of course, was video killed the radio star.
149340	155700	So what are we going to have have now Internet TV killed video?
155700	159380	I think somebody made that song like Internet killed the video star.
159380	160500	I think that was a thing.
160500	162120	It might have been a parody or something.
162120	164460	Maybe one of those songs that we used to play on the old network.
164460	167700	But one of those songs they always attribute to Weird Al that he didn't do.
167700	168700	Yeah.
168700	169700	Yes.
169700	170700	Yes.
170700	171700	Like a mislabeled Napster file.
171700	172700	Yes.
173100	175460	Oh, he still jokes about that, apparently.
175460	177740	Yes, exactly.
177740	178740	But yeah.
178740	179740	I now I distinctly.
179740	182600	Why shouldn't why wouldn't they celebrate this with with they should celebrate this
182600	183600	with Al TV?
183600	185660	Yes, they should.
185660	187220	I remember Al TV.
187220	190020	I distinctly remember that special.
190020	194660	I think my dad thought he was funny and I thought he was funny, too.
194660	196780	And I but I definitely remember that video.
196780	202540	I remember seeing that video on MTV, that video killed the radio star because, I mean,
202540	207380	in the very beginning of MTV, the first few weeks, there were only like nine music videos
207380	208380	at all.
208380	212780	It wasn't until much later that, you know, it caught fire that all these other record
212780	217900	labels started doing more videos.
217900	223060	I always remember Martha Quinn and Kennedy later on.
223060	224060	Oh, yeah.
224060	225060	I remember Kennedy.
225060	228420	I talked to Kennedy once on a radio thing.
228420	229420	Years and years and years.
229420	230420	I was in high school.
230420	232820	I used to religiously watch remote control.
232820	233820	Oh, yeah.
233820	234820	That was awesome.
234820	235820	That was my jam.
235820	236820	Yeah.
236820	244780	And then, you know, it's what gave us liquid television, which was something I still kind
244780	245780	of miss.
245780	250460	There was another show that was on very briefly called The Idiot Box, and it had Alex Winter
250460	251460	as the host.
251460	252460	OK.
252460	254700	And I think they they only aired like all of two episodes.
254700	259820	But at the time, I was kind of a fan girl of Alex Winter.
259820	260820	So I watched it.
260820	261820	I mean, I thought it was pretty funny.
261820	269340	But there's also another show that I think turned into the kids in the hall.
269340	270340	The kids.
270340	273500	I don't think because the whole started on MTV, but you might be thinking of the state
273500	274500	because the state.
274500	275500	That's what I'm thinking of the state.
275500	276500	Yeah.
276500	277500	The state has a different group.
277500	280700	But a lot of those people went on to Reno 911.
280700	283260	A lot of the same people are.
283260	286660	I just remember the guy whose catchphrase is I want to stick my balls in it and he'd
286660	288940	carry around his little balls.
289060	294100	OK, believe it or not, we are a video game podcast, but the chat room is lighting up
294100	295380	about MTV memories.
295380	296380	So you know what?
296380	297380	I'll indulge it.
297380	301460	And to be remote control had an NES game that was awesome.
301460	304100	And I loved it because I also love that show.
304100	306900	That was my lifelong dream was to be the game show host of that show.
306900	308500	It might still be.
308500	309500	So fifth dream in our.
309500	311700	I remember Colin Quinn on that show, too.
311700	312700	Yes.
312700	315580	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
315580	319500	at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network right after the Bobby
319500	320820	Blackwell show.
320820	324140	And you guys can chat along with our show, which fifth dream is saying some of those
324140	330380	weird channel services like Pluto TV has a 24 hour pop up video station.
330380	334620	Now pop up video, of course, is VH1 thing, but very closely related by MTV.
334620	336260	But yeah, it's all it's all MTV.
336260	337820	And I thought that was all part of Paramount.
337820	339960	All the MTV shows are on Paramount Plus now.
339960	341620	So I'm kind of surprised it's on Pluto.
341620	346420	But actually, now now that I'm saying it out loud, I think Pluto is also a Viacom thing.
346420	347860	It's just a very different thing.
347860	350680	But this that Pluto TV app is on your PlayStation.
350680	352100	It's on your Xbox.
352100	355700	It's it's one of the this is a weird niche thing now.
355700	356700	There's like three of them.
356700	359980	These free TV apps.
359980	365620	It's like old like it's basically commercially supported old ass movies like Netflix.
365620	367860	So you don't have to pay a monthly fee for it.
367860	371160	Or they also have like live TV.
371160	374160	And they have very niche TV stations.
374160	378440	Like there was one station on there that played nothing but RuPaul's Drag Race all day long.
378440	380360	Just Drag Race, Marathon 24.
380360	381840	I think they finally pulled it.
381840	383080	I don't know why, but they did.
383080	384680	But there was a Survivor one, too.
384680	385680	And there's all sorts.
385680	388680	There's an uncensored Hell's Kitchen, I think is on that same one.
388680	395760	So anyway, there's also getting me to sit down and watch TV, which it doesn't happen
395760	398520	unless it's Drag Race or Jessica Jones.
398520	399520	Yeah.
399520	403760	I think there's something to be said about turning on the TV and having that background
403760	407040	noise while you're folding laundry or whatever it is.
407040	409520	You know, sometimes you don't know what YouTube's for.
409520	410520	Yeah.
410520	411520	I think a lot.
411520	413400	You know, but I think these like Pluto TV and the etc.
413400	415200	I can't remember the names of the other ones.
415200	416280	To be might be another one.
416280	417280	I can't remember.
417280	418280	Sorry, guys.
418280	423040	That that kind of can also fill that with extremely niche things, kind of like how YouTube
423040	424040	can do.
424040	425760	You're absolutely right with that.
425760	429260	And Pod Culture saying Pluto had a Doctor Who channel, the next generation.
429260	430260	You're right.
430260	432100	I think there's like a Star Trek channel on there.
432100	433100	Absolutely.
433100	434100	Yes.
434100	436340	And the old school Nickelodeon channel is on one of those.
436340	439940	As long as that showed the tomorrow people, I'd be interested.
439940	440940	It might.
440940	441940	It might.
441940	442940	Look it up.
442940	443940	Look it up.
443940	444940	I want to see what else was.
444940	448780	What if there was like old British sci fi, like it played like Blake seven or something?
448780	451400	Honestly, it probably exists somewhere.
451400	455540	It might not be on that same app, but I bet that of course, that's a niche that somebody
455540	458240	you know who to ask our friends over British invaders.
458240	464480	They would know he could send our pals over their email about that.
464480	468240	Bobby Black Wolf speaking of an event where I sometimes see our friends, at least one
468240	469840	of our friends from British invaders.
469840	475520	Bobby Black Wolf says our Dragon Con panel is called Video Didn't Kill the Podcast Star.
475520	476520	So that's right.
476520	477520	There's there's a panel.
477520	478560	We're doing it again this year.
478560	481720	We've done it at least one other year, maybe two.
481720	486720	It's kind of about our transition from doing a long running podcast to the video format.
486720	487720	So you're right.
488200	490160	That name is kind of a little play on that as well.
490160	493020	So it's pretty, pretty fun.
493020	497840	So anyway, I should also mention, because you might be wondering, not joining us tonight
497840	498840	is Tech Master Loki.
498840	501040	You might be like, where's Loki go?
501040	502900	He just he had a family obligation.
502900	503900	It happens sometimes.
503900	506720	So he's just not here tonight, but he'll be back next week.
506720	508380	So it happens.
508380	510440	Sometimes we get to take a night off.
510440	513480	So Loki, Loki has the night off, but he'll be back next week.
513480	516160	So it's just dark Sakura and I feeling the love.
516200	517800	So tonight's the night.
517800	519560	It's just going to be the Dead by Daylight show.
519560	523680	You already I'm still working on that, too.
523680	526880	I need a co-host, maybe.
526880	530280	Maybe we'll indulge a little bit tonight, because without Matt here, we kind of have
530280	534400	a shorter list of stories that and I think it just kind of generally was.
534400	538680	There's some big things you talk about, but the whole scope of things was a bit of a slower
538680	539680	news week.
539680	542540	And I think that's just, you know, summer still being in full swing and all of that
542540	543540	stuff happening.
543540	544540	What's that?
544540	545540	Yeah.
545900	546900	That's just how it is.
546900	547900	Yes.
547900	548900	Just how it is right now.
548900	549900	Let's see.
549900	554140	Bobby Black Wolf with a very good point saying, thanks to data caps, I'll never have a streaming
554140	556940	channel on that I wasn't actively watching.
556940	557940	That's a very good point.
557940	563080	I don't watch a lot of the streaming stuff, but I'll watch it here and there.
563080	566060	But Twitch is a lot of my background stuff, too.
566060	571300	Like I'll put on a streamer that I like and I found a lot in the last few months ever
571300	576060	since Alan got me into freaking Dead by Daylight, you know, and I kind of found that whole
576060	577380	community in dark soccer.
577380	581340	I know this hits home for you, too, is it's like there's I don't know how I got so deep
581340	582340	with these people.
582340	586420	It's just endless amounts of content out there with all of that.
586420	592400	So well, and it's like now it's it's like, you know, I never, ever expected that when
592400	597540	I go into one of the the bigger guys chat rooms that I'd get, oh, hi, welcome in.
597540	599460	I'm glad that you made it to me.
599460	600460	Yeah.
600620	602500	I'm like, are we friends?
602500	604020	This is great.
604020	605020	Are we friends?
605020	608660	Which is interesting, Jamie, because to pretty much, you know, a lot of people that are here
608660	613400	on Sunday night, you you are a rock star and have been for many, many, many years.
613400	618180	So to be to be acknowledged by you for a lot of people here.
618180	621260	And I'm not trying to I'm not trying to completely gaslight you here, but I think this is like
621260	626940	one of those like, you know, in these parts, I when Senpai notices them, there's a lot
626940	628200	of people that are very happy.
628200	632820	So it's just it's it's neat that there are other I notice all of you chatters.
632820	634280	So Senpai noticed you.
634280	639200	Yeah, I actually it's funny, I'm I'm working on and this is just like a little aside.
639200	642200	I'm working on some bit redeems for my channel.
642200	644560	You know, like cheap stuff, right?
644560	647560	And one of them is Senpai notice me.
647560	648560	That's cute.
648560	649560	I like that.
649560	652200	I like I like the release.
652200	655700	I'm having like I don't stream a lot, a lot on my personal channel.
655700	659140	You know, I keep saying I need to do it more, but it's hard when Alan and I are sharing
659140	662780	that space and especially in the summer when it gets really hot.
662780	666220	But I think about those types of things and what to do for those regimes.
666220	670660	And I do like the streamers that have these really cute, like short little things that
670660	674460	they do, like one streamer that I watch a lot, does a little thing where he'll just
674460	675800	go boop and that's it.
675800	677380	That's like basically what you're doing.
677380	679380	And there's that's Nick.
679380	680380	Nick.
680380	681380	Yeah.
681380	682380	There's another one that'll get up.
682380	687060	Yesterday, one that Alan watches a lot, that'll just get up and hug like to stand up and do
687060	688060	a hug.
688060	689060	I like that.
689060	690060	That's cute.
690060	692300	There's some Laurie Bird does the vocoder singing.
692300	694580	Oh, that's cute.
694580	695580	That is really cute.
695580	702380	But but no, I've I you know, I've learned a lot actually just in playing Dead by Daylight
702380	706780	and about the stream set ups and everything from just watching other people and talking
706780	707780	to them.
707780	711140	I'm still behind on quite a few things because I game on a Mac.
711140	714340	You know, they're like, I can't run like chat bot.
714340	716940	I have to run cloud bot, you know, and I figure some stuff out.
716940	718980	I can't do some of the games.
718980	720980	And slabs is garbage.
720980	723460	Slobs, I'm sorry.
723460	726820	Well, by garbage, I mean, it doesn't see my stadia window.
726820	735140	And I do most of my gaming through stadia, which because of you, because I think it was
735140	741340	you that that suggested that I start putting stadia in my tags when I go live.
741340	745580	I have met other stadia Dead by Daylight players.
745580	747260	I am no longer alone in the world.
747260	748260	Thank you.
748260	749260	Thank you.
749260	750260	Thank you.
750260	751260	Yes, that was me.
751260	752260	I know.
752260	754500	I remember suggesting that because I said you have it.
754500	757060	You're a special snowflake in the stadia thing.
757060	758060	And I wasn't.
758060	759060	But I will say this.
759060	761820	I didn't think it would be other Dead by Daylight state.
761820	764420	I thought it would just be stadia enthusiasts.
764420	768100	There were a couple that were just stadia, but a couple were also dead by daylight.
768100	769100	Huh?
769100	770100	Well, there you go.
770100	771100	Yeah.
771100	773140	So other people are familiar with Miss Debbie.
773140	781300	I do find that I have good luck with the growth of my channel when I try not to stream one
781300	782300	thing.
782300	785340	Like, I don't get a lot of new followers when I play Final Fantasy 14 because I always play
785340	786900	Final Fantasy 14.
786900	791460	But like, one of the best nights I got a lot of new followers was when I did No Man's Sky
791460	793140	out of the blue for the first time.
793140	796780	I got people that watch a lot of No Man's Sky where it's like, oh, this is a new name.
796780	798420	Who is this doing this?
798420	804060	And I know this happens to Alan started playing his music games on Monday nights.
804060	807100	And he gets a lot like that spin rhythm.
807100	810540	He just randomly started playing on stage apparently has a rabid fan community behind
810540	811540	it.
811540	814220	Because when he streams that game, he gets all these new people that show up that will
814220	817640	that are looking for that game particularly and all the mods behind it and everything.
817640	825400	So it is it is interesting how I find that mixing that up does kind of let you get seen
825400	827920	by more people because your keywords change.
827920	828920	Right.
828920	832800	So when when I beat Fantasian because I'm getting close to that.
832800	833800	Oh, I bet.
833800	836960	I need to think of something new for for Tuesday fantasy zone.
836960	843160	So maybe I'll do Hataful Boyfriend again, or maybe I'll find something else who knows
843160	844720	you want my suggestions.
844720	848920	Do you want my honest suggestion live on air, even though, you know, you didn't ask for
848920	849920	it?
849920	850920	Sure.
850920	854440	We to me, Dark Soccer and chat room, feel free to agree, disagree.
854440	856800	To me, Dark Soccer, you're the queen of retro gaming.
856800	860960	It's one of the huge things that like you bring to the show, your knowledge, your depth,
860960	866520	your fandom for these sometimes downright obscure things that not the rest of us really
866520	867760	like know a lot about.
867760	870480	Like I am surprised you don't stream more retro.
870480	871860	I realize the setup.
871860	873940	You don't have the right capture stuff for that setup.
873940	878140	But I would almost say just cheat and use emulators because emulate it.
878140	879140	Yeah.
879140	880460	Chances are you own it.
880460	883020	So you're not really breaking the rules.
883020	888180	Like I might I might try to dig up, see if there's a version of Magic Engine that runs
888180	894540	and play through one of those translated like Rondo of Blood or something.
894540	895540	Yeah.
895540	897540	I think that would be fun.
897540	898540	Yeah.
898540	903780	Of course, it's just going to be me playing as Maria with her terrible singing.
903780	906620	But there's a lot of people that are probably never even seen it.
906620	910980	So you know, there was a Castlevania collection, though it had it on there.
910980	911980	Oh, that's right.
911980	912980	That's right.
912980	913980	Yeah.
913980	918980	So although I actually do kind of want to play, I've also been thinking about maybe
918980	922180	playing Jackie Crush.
922180	926820	Which is in the Devil's Crush family.
926820	929100	It was a SNES one that came out.
929100	930700	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
930700	931700	Wow.
931700	932700	That would be awesome.
932700	933700	Yeah.
933700	934700	Mike Defton Chats is at this point.
934700	935700	I don't think most people will care if you use emulators.
935700	936700	No.
936700	941340	And especially if it's like the stepping stone to, you know, going, OK, there is interest
941340	942340	in this.
942340	946200	And now maybe I will make that investment in whatever capture card I need to hook up
946200	948400	the old Saturn or whatever it is.
948400	950860	I think that, you know, might be might be a way to do it.
950860	953700	So that'd be great if I can do Saturn emulation on my Mac.
953700	954700	That would be awesome.
954700	955700	Yeah.
956580	957580	Food for thought.
957580	958580	All right.
958580	960660	We're we're several minutes into the show and we haven't even gotten to the kickoff
960660	961660	topic.
961660	963860	But that's that's what happens when Loki isn't here to mediate us.
963860	966340	We will just talk about whatever we want.
966340	969900	I just picture his flat stare while we're jabbering and who am I?
969900	970900	Who am I kidding?
970900	975620	He's he's going to get off topic just as much so that's part of the charm here at Orange
975620	976620	Lounge Radio.
976620	977620	It is what it is.
977620	978620	All right.
978620	979900	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
979900	983380	Actually, we kind of have a you know, this is eight hundred and seventy eight episodes
983380	984660	Orange Lounge Radio.
984660	988140	We've been doing the format with the kickoff topic at least as long as we've been on Twitch,
988140	989220	if not longer.
989220	992900	This doesn't happen a lot where the same thing needs to be talked about at the top of the
992900	996660	show two weeks in a row sometimes, but not a lot.
996660	1001340	We're in that position tonight because this is a very important shift in the industry
1001340	1002340	that's happening right now.
1002340	1005380	This is a very important reckoning for the industry.
1005380	1010660	And you notice I'm not saying one company, I'm saying the industry that I is playing
1010660	1013080	out through one company right now.
1013080	1016240	But Dark Soccer, if you don't mind, I will let you take it from here.
1016240	1017560	Oh, yeah.
1017560	1028840	So on this past Wednesday, hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees walked out and this was
1028840	1038960	after the lawsuit and Blizzard's rather dismissive release on terms.
1038960	1041780	You know, they're oh, we're sorry, but blah, blah, blah.
1041780	1046000	You don't say I'm sorry, but you say I'm sorry and don't do the shit again.
1046000	1054500	So at any rate, there was a walk out where they rallied in front of the Blizzard headquarters
1054500	1061980	in Irvine to protest their response to the discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit.
1061980	1067460	It was attended by more than 350 people.
1067460	1069120	There were some signs out.
1069120	1072580	One of them said nerf male privilege.
1072580	1077720	Another one said unaccountable corporate bureaucrats are driving the best employees out of Activision
1077720	1079360	Blizzard.
1079360	1085500	The walkout started at 10 a.m. Pacific and ended at 2 p.m.
1085500	1092080	Also other companies were supporting the employees and actually sent food trucks out and catered
1092080	1093340	and brought porta potties.
1093340	1095980	Oh, I hadn't heard of that.
1095980	1096980	Interesting.
1097500	1106780	People were driving by and honking in support and there were people that spoke out about
1106780	1119080	it, but they wanted an anonymity for fear of retribution from the company.
1119080	1125940	And then, of course, on social media, there was, of course, a call to not cross the virtual
1125940	1128880	picket line by playing their games.
1128880	1134800	That's including Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty.
1134800	1141940	And honestly, I don't think I have played an Activision Blizzard game since the deal
1141940	1148580	with the Chinese gamer with the free Hong Kong.
1148580	1155040	But yeah, I am completely with this kind of behavior, I don't care how much you love a
1155040	1162700	game, you know, this is something this gross behavior.
1162700	1170380	I mean, they say that boycotts don't really do a lot, but I think the walkout will do
1170380	1171820	quite a bit.
1171820	1180140	And I do think that people making an active and vocal choice not to put their money into
1180140	1188860	the company, while it may not be financially effective, I think it will be effective in
1188860	1189860	terms of commentary.
1189860	1191360	Does that make sense?
1191360	1192360	Yes.
1192360	1196360	And I think the good thing about the walkout, especially too, was something we were talking
1196360	1204040	about last week about how this is not a every Blizzard and Activision employee problem.
1204040	1208920	In fact, there are a lot of fantastic people working for Activision Blizzard who are sick
1208920	1210520	and tired of this crap as well.
1210520	1215960	And I think that walkout really sort of personified that, and I think helped a lot of people out
1215960	1221280	there who maybe hadn't gotten to that point yet really see that this is not an issue of
1221280	1223220	all the employees at Activision Blizzard.
1223220	1225180	This is a management issue.
1225180	1230520	I'm going to make a more extreme comparison though, and there were a lot of people that
1230520	1236720	didn't vote in the 2016 election, were they good people?
1236720	1238720	Because they partly enabled you-know-who.
1238720	1239720	Debatable.
1239720	1244940	But that my point stands.
1244940	1246660	Every scenario is different, right?
1246660	1249640	There are good people that do nothing.
1249640	1256240	I'm glad they're doing something now that they feel empowered to do it, but there needs
1256240	1263600	to be a degree of fearlessness when it comes to confronting any sort of abusive and oppressive
1263600	1264600	behavior.
1264600	1265600	Right.
1266120	1268320	At some point it becomes damn the consequences.
1268320	1269320	Right.
1269320	1273280	But and I think that's where you kind of see the industry sort of inching closer and closer
1273280	1279920	to probably some type of unionization or at least maybe like some type of like representation
1279920	1284520	where there's like a legal defense sort of thing for the you know, because you just said
1284520	1289320	it a minute ago is that there were some people speaking out with anonymity because they feared
1289320	1290400	repercussions.
1290400	1295620	So that whole thing is still a very valid threat looming for a lot of people.
1295620	1297520	And we all know that shouldn't exist.
1297520	1300440	That shouldn't in a perfect world that shouldn't exist.
1300440	1303280	Unfortunately, you know, some people really still feel it does.
1303280	1307220	So at least there needs to be that banding of employees.
1307220	1311920	You know, I think it ought to just be a union, but at least let's take those baby steps in
1311920	1318300	that direction of some type of like legal defense, a wall together that, you know, we
1318300	1322660	are able to speak out when we see these things without repercussion.
1322660	1327560	And maybe, sorry, real quick, maybe that's something that we go to our government.
1327560	1331500	And I harped on this a lot last week where we applaud the government making these changes
1331500	1334140	in the right direction and taking this action that they took.
1334140	1335140	Sorry, Jamie, go ahead.
1335140	1343020	Well, I was saying that that there were Ubisoft employees also who decided to step up in light
1343020	1344800	of this.
1344800	1351240	And there was an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard employees, and they
1351240	1355580	sent it to their CEO, Yves Guillemot.
1355580	1360300	It is clear from the frequency of these reports that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained
1360300	1363400	culture of abusive behavior within the industry.
1363400	1367800	It should no longer be a surprise to anyone, employees, executives, journalists or fans
1367800	1371040	that these heinous acts are going on.
1371040	1379280	And it called for the employees of Ubisoft, Blizzard, other leaders in the industry to
1379280	1384780	get together and, quote, agreed to a set of rules and processes for handling reports of
1384780	1385780	these offenses.
1385780	1386780	Bingo.
1386780	1388300	The company shouldn't be doing this.
1388300	1392520	This is going to require a bigger touch.
1392520	1400440	And then there was another another employee of Blizzard, Sabrina Brogan, who informed
1400440	1406560	the Activision Blizzard King Women's Network that she was going to step down as the network's
1406560	1415360	Europe, Middle East and Africa lead after seeing this email from.
1415360	1420200	Let's see, from their chief complaint from Blizzard's chief compliance officer, Francis
1420200	1421200	Townsend.
1421200	1423040	Oh, we got to talk about her.
1423040	1424040	She got to go.
1424040	1426000	She's got to go.
1426000	1432620	Where the lawsuit was called a distorted and untrue picture of our company.
1432620	1439120	And and the reason why Sabrina stepped down is because Townsend is also the executive
1439120	1441720	sponsor for the Women's Network.
1441720	1444880	And so she resigned.
1444880	1451440	She means Brogan resigned and and she put out the message saying, I am ashamed I am
1451440	1454520	working for this company.
1454520	1459560	Fran Townsend, by the way, if you look at her Twitter account at Fran Townsend made
1459560	1462200	a tweet on July 30th.
1462200	1466960	So this was not an old thing dug up to use against her now.
1466960	1468680	July 30th of this year.
1468680	1471100	So two days ago.
1471100	1476280	She tags two people and puts and the problem with whistleblowing by the Atlantic and links
1476280	1481280	to an article titled The New Moral Code of America's Elite.
1481280	1490240	So she tweets an article about the problem with whistleblowers.
1490240	1493680	She's she needs to and this is this is odd.
1493680	1495680	She's corporate garbage.
1495680	1498160	Because I should be saying we need to uplift.
1498160	1499520	We need to uplift women.
1499520	1504560	We need to, you know, have more women in these types of positions and so forth.
1504560	1508180	But unfortunately, gang, not this one.
1508180	1512780	My tweet to her was you are the problem.
1512780	1517860	Bobby Blackwell points out, if you can look at her Twitter account, she's blocking everyone,
1517860	1520100	including her fellow co-workers.
1520100	1526600	She needs to pack her boxes and leave, as a lot of people do at Activision Blizzard
1526600	1528140	in the management district.
1528140	1535140	Honestly, I'm surprised that people aren't actually actively reporting her account.
1535140	1536140	Anyway.
1536140	1537140	Yeah.
1537180	1541260	Some folks in chat, she says, yeah, she has to go.
1541260	1542260	Terrible lady.
1542260	1543260	Yeah.
1543260	1548380	And it's I think it's an example of you can still, you know, actively be working against
1548380	1554060	the, you know, group that you're a part of that you're supposed to be uplifting.
1554060	1555060	Yeah.
1555060	1560020	As you heard, Matt says she also sent that company wide email shaming people for whistleblowing.
1560020	1564300	Even Bobby Kotick criticized her stance.
1564300	1566140	Bobby Kotick replied to this whole thing.
1566140	1569300	It took him a few days.
1569300	1573020	I don't want to compliment it, but I will say this.
1573020	1575920	At least he outlined some steps.
1575920	1581100	I'm not sure they were the right steps overall, especially when you consider some of the companies
1581100	1582500	they're saying they're working with.
1582500	1586340	So again, I'm going to be very careful how much of a gold star I'm going to get.
1586340	1593840	I'm giving one gold piece of glitter for at least this actually says, here are some actionable
1593840	1598520	steps we're going to take, which is more than you might have taken down that post.
1598520	1599520	No.
1599520	1605160	Well, I'm looking at it right now on my phone, unless she did it between the time the show
1605160	1608160	started and now, which is certainly possible because I'm sure she's getting a lot of shit
1608160	1609160	for it.
1609160	1617480	Um, I will screenshot that bad boy and I'm going to send it to my friend, Dark Sakura.
1617480	1618480	And I'm going to do that one more time.
1618480	1619480	I just blocked her.
1619480	1620480	Okay.
1620480	1622080	Now you'll never find it.
1622080	1623080	All right.
1623320	1624320	There you go.
1624320	1625320	Well, you sent me a screenshot.
1625320	1626320	So that's different.
1626320	1627320	You're right.
1627320	1628320	I did.
1628320	1629320	Um, screenshots are forever.
1629320	1630320	Yeah.
1630320	1633880	Oh, what a, yeah, I'm going to say it.
1633880	1635880	What a cunt.
1635880	1636880	Seriously.
1636880	1637880	All right.
1637880	1640880	We'll just leave it at that.
1640880	1641880	Anyway.
1641880	1645880	Um, anything else you want to mention or, or chat wants to mention about this, uh, ongoing
1645880	1646880	story?
1647680	1658440	Um, well, I was looking at just some of the stuff about, uh, codex, um, letter and I like,
1658440	1665200	I like this, um, uh, quote, uh, from, it says, while we are pleased to see that our collective
1665200	1669740	voices have convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications, this response
1669740	1673880	fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.
1673880	1674880	That's the crux of it.
1674880	1675880	Yeah.
1675880	1678080	Um, that, that's why I gave a gold piece of glitter.
1678080	1679080	Yeah.
1679080	1681000	Just one tiny little gold, gold thing.
1681000	1685960	Um, but there are other parts of it such as, and as chat points out, uh, Mike Deaf saying
1685960	1689480	granted Bobby Kotick also brought the anti-union firm to activists.
1689480	1692800	That's why I'm going to refrain from getting a gold star or anything further.
1692800	1693800	Yeah.
1693800	1696800	Um, but one piece of gold glitter, I mean, Hey, you know what?
1696800	1702040	He gets a star drawn in a gold jelly ink on cardboard.
1702040	1703040	You know what?
1703040	1704040	You know what they say?
1704040	1705120	A broken clock is right twice a day.
1705120	1708520	And I think in some of these scenarios, it's like, okay, congrats.
1708520	1709520	Yay.
1709520	1710520	You did it.
1710520	1711520	You were right today.
1711520	1712520	Congrats.
1712520	1713520	Thanks, captain obvious.
1713520	1716420	You should at least call that out because you know.
1716420	1723720	What we need, and I, I, I understand some of my audience, right?
1723720	1727660	We need fewer male voices in the industry.
1727660	1734600	We need the men to stop talking about it and listen to the women talk about it.
1735200	1739080	I would agree in the sense of that, all the decision makers should not be men.
1739080	1740080	Period.
1740080	1744720	Uh, and we need, we mean, we have need more diversity in management period.
1744720	1752040	Well, I'm just saying though, that instead of spotlighting, you know, these men in upper
1752040	1760160	management who, I mean, I would grant that many of them are probably just saying what
1760160	1764720	needs to be heard to stay, you know, profitable.
1764720	1771920	I'm going to say it, but I think that we need to hear more of the people that's experienced
1771920	1772920	it.
1772920	1778360	We need to hear from the women who have been fired or abused.
1778360	1784380	We need to hear their voices and need to listen to them.
1784380	1787840	Critical myth and chat says these companies need a flush of upper management at the very
1787840	1788840	least.
1788840	1790640	We need to be flushed down the toilet.
1790640	1797760	That's my, it's weird to say, but my hope is that that, that storms are coming.
1797760	1800440	Oh, it is that.
1800440	1801960	That's my hope.
1801960	1804680	Not that any, not that any of this is good news.
1804680	1809020	I mean, if we look at the Activision Blizzard and the complaints, a woman died like that's
1809020	1812160	a woman died because of it's even worse.
1812160	1814040	She apparently took her life.
1814040	1815040	Yeah.
1815240	1824720	So there's, there's no good news here, but if there's something that you can go, maybe
1824720	1827920	change will happen this time.
1827920	1836320	Well, and then there was that whole post about, um, uh, on the verge about the Cosby suite.
1836320	1837320	Oh yeah.
1837320	1844280	That's so, Oh, that when I just seeing the picture.
1844520	1848840	So I'm going to tell you something about autism.
1848840	1849840	Okay.
1849840	1853960	Sometimes it's possible to feel so much emotion that all of them shut off.
1853960	1856740	I don't get like that very, very often.
1856740	1858120	I was like that.
1858120	1868800	I could not feel anything and I couldn't talk for a while because it angered and frustrated
1868800	1872780	me so much that my, my feelings just shut completely down.
1872780	1873780	I shut down.
1874020	1875020	That's how mad I got.
1875020	1878980	Somebody else in chat, I'm sorry, I forgot who said, I couldn't even finish the article
1878980	1879980	said that in chat.
1879980	1880980	Yeah.
1880980	1885980	So I, I, I think there's a lot of people, um, definitely feeling some sort of way from
1885980	1886980	that article.
1886980	1887980	It was, it was gross.
1887980	1890260	Um, it's absolutely disgusting.
1890260	1891780	And all of those faces in there.
1891780	1897380	I want every last one of those people identified and made public.
1897380	1898940	I think that's already happened.
1898940	1899940	Uh, for sure.
1899940	1904460	Now because, uh, Oh yes, because one of them works at riot now, one of them was ghost crawler
1904460	1908620	and he's at riot now and had to put out this whole letter that he sent to his riot folks
1908620	1912540	saying, Hey, this article came out and I want to apologize for this and kind of like kind
1912540	1913540	of set his stance.
1913540	1917100	But it's one of those things where it's like, apologize cause he got caught.
1917100	1921020	It's just one of those things where it's like, you know, even if it is from 2013 or whatever
1921020	1925260	eight years ago or something, there's just not a lot that can be said to justify it.
1925260	1929060	Like I, and here's the thing, and I, I just, just to put it out there.
1929060	1934980	I have, I have heard the whole, well, that picture was from 2013 and the Bill Cosby stuff
1934980	1941140	didn't come out till 2015 but I think to go that route sort of misses the overarching
1941140	1942140	point.
1942140	1943460	And let's go back to that lawsuit.
1943460	1946100	We're going to go back to that lawsuit.
1946100	1949700	Why did Activision Blizzard get slapped on the wrist by the state in the first place?
1949700	1953460	It was that frat boy culture.
1953460	1960540	And what do I see when I hear about the luxury suite where all the male employees go to drink
1960540	1962100	once BlizzCon is over?
1962100	1963140	What is that?
1963140	1965100	No matter what it's called.
1965100	1966940	That's frat boy culture.
1966940	1968980	That absolutely is.
1968980	1978740	Well, and SSJ 100 Matt basically does make a point.
1978740	1984380	Many female voices like, okay, so Jade Raymond gets spotlight constantly, but many female
1984380	1987140	voices like her get death threats and harass so much.
1987140	1988660	It's a culture problem that needs to be fixed.
1988660	1994300	I don't know how to fix it other than giving more to uplift those voices and hold people
1994300	1995300	accountable.
1995300	1996500	And that's exactly it.
1996500	2004660	But the thing is, is that if enough, if enough people raise their voice, if enough people
2004660	2007620	step out, they can't stop all of us.
2007620	2010500	That's 100% it.
2010500	2014100	And this is what you, because I don't think anybody here does that garbage.
2014100	2018380	If you do, all I have to say is that you're in the wrong place or you need to change your
2018380	2021700	behavior immediately, period.
2021700	2027140	But I think what we all can do, all of us here at OLR, VoG, all of us decent people
2027140	2033060	in the gaming industry of which there are more of us than the other side, trust.
2033060	2039700	What we have to do, even though it is uncomfortable sometimes, we have to stop giving our passive
2039700	2046180	approval to those sorts of comments directed at Jade Raymond and women, et cetera, by saying
2046180	2048220	nothing.
2048220	2049460	Speak up and call out.
2049460	2050760	You have to speak up.
2050760	2053240	You have to call out.
2053240	2054300	Exactly it.
2054300	2058740	And I'm not saying sit down and shut up just because they are a woman.
2058740	2064820	You are able to be critical of women when they do, you know, such as what's her name
2064820	2065820	that I just said?
2065820	2066820	I get fired.
2066820	2067820	Fran Townsend.
2067820	2068820	OK.
2068820	2069980	When there is a.
2069980	2076680	But notice, I'm not sitting here going, you know, F that B, even though I kind of feel
2076680	2077680	that way.
2077680	2078680	But you know what I mean?
2078680	2079680	I said it.
2079680	2080680	I know.
2080680	2084060	But there's there's more substance behind it.
2084060	2087180	You have a reason to be able to say that.
2087180	2094980	That is not just she's a woman and therefore she should be in the kitchen and baby, whatever,
2094980	2095980	all that.
2095980	2096980	All the bullshit.
2096980	2097980	What she needs to do is be in a dungeon.
2097980	2098980	Just say it.
2098980	2100860	And not even the fun kind.
2100860	2101860	Anyhow.
2101860	2102860	Yeah.
2102860	2107620	My Deft in Chat says everything about that room is horrible.
2107620	2108620	Talking about the Cosby Street.
2108620	2109620	Sorry.
2109620	2110620	Go ahead.
2110620	2113500	But but I mean, maybe we should make this a campaign.
2113500	2118420	You know, the the speak up and call out.
2118420	2124440	Maybe that should be like a campaign or something that that we start and spread around.
2124440	2125600	We make it a thing.
2125600	2131660	I think if every one of us goes out, you know, even the people listening right now, the people
2131660	2139180	listening to the the recording afterwards to the podcast, if everyone just stops and
2139180	2143460	calls for it, you know, the word could spread, you know, call for it.
2143460	2144980	Ask other people to call for it.
2144980	2147320	Step up, you know, step up to it.
2147320	2150700	It nothing changes until you make it change.
2150700	2151700	Right.
2151700	2156700	And if you sit there on your ass, go, oh, I agree her and don't do shit.
2156700	2157700	Guess what you get for it?
2157700	2158700	You get shit.
2158700	2159700	Yeah, nothing.
2159700	2162980	If you don't change, you're always going to get the same result.
2162980	2170380	And that's this is this is a theme you're hearing amongst lots of things the past couple
2170380	2175320	of years, because it is that it's that whole talk about we need the folks in the position
2175320	2178340	of privilege to be able to speak out.
2178340	2179340	Right.
2179340	2184440	So for it to use and to use an analogy to talk about something directly where this applies
2184440	2185960	in another place.
2185960	2191480	So when we talk about Black Lives Matter, right, then if I believe that Black Lives
2191480	2197620	Matter and I do and I want to, you know, support, you know, all of the my my friends that are
2197620	2205140	black and everything, then I need to when I hear two white people telling a black joke,
2205140	2210060	I have to step up, which thank God I haven't heard that in a long time, a long time.
2210060	2215260	But, you know, in my life, years and years ago, especially in the high school days, those
2215260	2218020	are the types of shitty things I would hear sometimes.
2218020	2222620	And so I have to be able to speak up and say, that's not funny.
2222620	2225420	Like, did you have you looked at the calendar?
2225420	2226420	It's 2021.
2226420	2227420	Yeah, right.
2227660	2231300	Why did you think that it was OK to say that joke in front of me?
2231300	2237980	And if I'm not able to have that uncomfortable conversation, nothing's going to change.
2237980	2239340	And that's it.
2239340	2240340	And it's the same thing.
2240340	2244140	It's the same thing with with LGBT, et cetera.
2244140	2248420	If I'm sure there are people that have told gay jokes about me behind my back and my true
2248420	2251420	friends are the ones that stick up and say, don't do that.
2251420	2253420	Mm hmm.
2254420	2255420	Oh, sorry.
2255420	2256420	Go ahead.
2256420	2263860	I'm actually I'm actually making my post about it right now so that, you know, I can hopefully
2263860	2264860	get it started.
2264860	2267300	I really think that we need to have more more said about it.
2267300	2268300	So, yeah.
2268300	2272540	As Joan Hunter Matt in chat says, did you see there was that other story about the pregnant
2272540	2277260	women woman who management refused to give her time to see the doctor when she was having
2277260	2278260	complications?
2278260	2282940	I forgot what Activision Blizzard's response was to it, but it made my blood boil.
2283460	2288980	Well, those are the types of issues where that's why the state is getting involved with
2288980	2294460	a lawsuit now, because that type of stuff is straight up against the law.
2294460	2296340	And that's why you're seeing that being leveraged.
2296340	2303740	So so unfortunately, correct me if I'm wrong, but the Cosby suite and all that stuff.
2303740	2306500	I mean, we can look at it and go, that's pretty fucked up.
2306500	2308940	But there's nothing the state of California can really do about it.
2308940	2314740	They're not breaking the law, per se, unless something illegal goes on in that suite.
2314740	2317500	They're not breaking the law.
2317500	2321060	This, as Joan Hunter Matt pointed out, that was breaking the law.
2321060	2323060	That's discrimination against somebody because they're pregnant.
2323060	2327020	And that is very much that's certainly against the law in California, if not at the federal
2327020	2330960	level, which I'm pretty sure it is.
2330960	2334540	That's basically a form of sexual harassment, long story short.
2334540	2340900	So that is why Activision Blizzard is in trouble with the state of California.
2340900	2343140	It's now among other things.
2343140	2348540	Please don't get me wrong, but it's just these other things that are now kind of playing
2348540	2354700	into it alongside of that, that's, you know, making it making it a moment of reckoning
2354700	2359500	for the whole industry, for sure.
2359500	2363420	Sia Tabiri in chat says a few months ago, someone I knew in high school messaged me
2363580	2366980	and told me he was always amazed at how well I dealt with stuff in high school.
2366980	2371100	And apparently I'd blocked out a lot or I was not aware of a lot of bullying, harassment,
2371100	2375120	bad stuff that went on behind my back.
2375120	2379540	I don't know if this is like too raw for me to get into on a video game podcast, but all
2379540	2384660	I can say is that, like, I really feel that comment because there are definitely a lot
2384660	2390840	of parts of high school, especially junior high school, that I straight up have blocked
2390840	2392420	out, blacked out.
2392420	2398700	Like I look back on certain memories I can and I actually think some of that plays into
2398700	2404460	the memory issues I have ongoing today because I have that's how PTSD works, Rob.
2404460	2406060	Well, then guess what?
2406060	2410340	I mean, we're not going to diagnose those sorts of things on the show, but I can tell
2410340	2412060	you this is someone who has PTSD.
2412060	2416780	If you want to if you want to go that direction, then perhaps.
2416780	2420780	But all I can say is that, you know, that type of stuff and the associated traumas and
2420780	2427540	stuff left me to this place where now I barely I have a hard time remembering a lot of things,
2427540	2430420	and I think some of that plays into it for sure, absolutely.
2430420	2437820	Now, the good news is video games were oftentimes my escape from all of that, to be quite honest,
2437820	2444580	because video games were an awesome story, video games where I could escape a lot of
2444580	2452180	that and get into a world where, you know, I wasn't being threatened with violence and
2452180	2453180	called names.
2453180	2459220	But anyway, we won't get into that.
2459220	2462180	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, yeah, I've blocked out a lot of high school as well.
2462180	2465280	I remember the worst things, but not a lot of stuff in between.
2465280	2467740	It's interesting because I always get asked, are you going to go to your high school reunion?
2467740	2474380	And I'm always like, I can think of nothing in this world I want to do less.
2474380	2479820	My high school, honestly, once I stopped giving a shit and punch that one girl in the
2479820	2482640	nose, no one gave me a problem anymore.
2482640	2486900	I've blocked out most of my home life.
2486900	2495920	And it was for being a woman or, you know, a girl at the time that dared to speak up,
2495920	2507120	to call her stepdad a sexist asshole, to question everything, to be weird.
2507120	2511200	You know, I got it more at home than I did at school.
2511200	2517760	And that is, I'm not going to go into a lot of that because it really is, a lot of it
2517760	2524540	is super personal, but you need, I, we really need to make, and this is actually going back
2524540	2525860	to the Activision Blizzard thing.
2525860	2531940	We need to make safe spaces for people so that they can speak up and not just to speak
2531940	2535140	up, but to have a fucking break.
2535140	2537940	I think we need to recognize there's a lot of people who very clearly have been through
2537940	2541940	some trauma in the gaming industry and they need that type of space.
2541940	2542940	Absolutely.
2542940	2543940	100%.
2543940	2544940	Yeah.
2544940	2549720	Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I go back to my high school reunion to get all the apologies.
2549720	2552500	You know, it's, I get, I get that comment.
2552500	2553500	I do.
2553500	2558420	Um, from my perspective, I'm just kind of like, I, it's, it's, it's weird.
2558420	2566140	I literally do not care about a lot of those people and I'm, I mean, I just, and there
2566140	2568020	are some people from high school that are very cool.
2568020	2569780	I keep in touch with on Facebook and stuff like that.
2569780	2571980	I don't want to make it sound like every single person in high school was Dick.
2571980	2574940	No, there was a lot of them, but like, it's hard to explain.
2574940	2578360	Like I, like as far as like the people who bullied me and stuff, do I, do I want to go
2578360	2582220	and like a big Romy and Michelle high school reunion sort of thing and show them all up
2582220	2583220	and all that?
2583220	2587860	No, I, it's, it's, I, I don't, I don't know what easy way to put it.
2587860	2590060	I don't care if those people are dead.
2590060	2592800	I don't care if those people are millionaires.
2592800	2595020	I don't exist in your universe.
2595020	2596300	They don't exist to me.
2596300	2597300	Exactly.
2597300	2602720	I have had to block them out and cut them out like little like dolls or something.
2602720	2604940	I do not care about these people.
2604940	2606100	Yeah.
2606100	2614420	I followed a few on Facebook, but I was like, your lives are boring.
2614420	2616660	You're boring.
2616660	2623620	You said you had all of this, just all of these, you know, dreams that you had and career
2623620	2624820	stuff that you wanted to do.
2624820	2627500	And I'm talking mostly about the girls I knew.
2627500	2628500	Right.
2628500	2634700	And you know, and I'm not putting this down as, as a choice, mind you, but like they got
2634700	2639780	married young and had lots of kids and now they're Christian mom.
2639780	2643540	And I'm like, you're fucking boring.
2643540	2652700	You stopped defining your life by your terms and did it by the terms of other people.
2652700	2657140	And yeah, that's where I think we're getting off topic.
2657140	2658140	It's fine.
2658140	2659140	It's fine.
2659140	2664140	Uh, there's, there's a lot of, see, see what these stories bring out though.
2664580	2665580	It is.
2665580	2666580	It is a lot to unpack.
2666580	2669940	And I think that's why there's a lot of people reacting to this, you know, and maybe they're
2669940	2673740	not even involved with it directly, but it's kind of like, um, you were saying in our chat
2673740	2677100	person was saying, I see stuff like that Cosby suite thing.
2677100	2679260	And I just, I don't know what you want to call it.
2679260	2680260	I disassociate.
2680260	2683140	I, everybody responds different ways to it.
2683140	2687180	I just, I'm, I just, I flow it out of my body.
2687180	2688180	I can't see it.
2688180	2689180	Yeah.
2689180	2690180	It stops existing.
2690180	2691180	Yep.
2691180	2692180	Anyway.
2692220	2694820	That's kind of what happened when my emotions shut down.
2694820	2700620	I had to basically wipe it before I could think or feel again.
2700620	2701620	Okay.
2701620	2704440	Anyway, let's go on to happier topics.
2704440	2705440	Video games.
2705440	2707620	They're great and escapism.
2707620	2710340	And because of them, we all met each other.
2710340	2713660	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
2713660	2714660	this week.
2714660	2718040	And I I've been playing a lot, uh, but I'll start with you, Darzaga.
2718040	2721820	I killed a bunch of people in Dead by Daylight.
2722460	2728340	I don't know what it has been, but it's either complete fail with the shittiest of survivors,
2728340	2736240	like and by shitty, I mean just like salty little tryhards or it's been really engaging
2736240	2741460	matches that have been fun to play and, and that I've won.
2741460	2743140	And Rob, a miracle happened.
2743140	2745140	You got a four K.
2745140	2747740	No, I've gotten several four Ks since my first one.
2747740	2748740	I stopped counting them.
2748740	2751180	I don't know what else to shock up there with Dead by Daylight.
2751420	2754420	The miracle is a three K on Haddonfield.
2754420	2755420	Oh, okay.
2755420	2756420	Okay.
2756420	2757420	With pig.
2757420	2758420	All right.
2758420	2759420	Had three K.
2759420	2760420	Yeah.
2760420	2764220	And I'll tell you the one who won was a David named bear and he wasn't shirtless.
2764220	2766220	So his name didn't fit him.
2766220	2767220	Anyway.
2767220	2770380	Um, you have to have shirtless David.
2770380	2771380	I'm sorry.
2771380	2772380	That's just what you have to do.
2772380	2777260	Um, I also have played Mandalorian finally.
2777260	2779640	Um, it's pretty fun.
2779640	2785600	It's got a shaker motor in it and ours shakes a lot, but I kind of don't hate it.
2785600	2789440	Um, uh, the, the modes in it are really fun.
2789440	2791040	Um, it's got great sound.
2791040	2793040	I, I, I'm going to put this out here.
2793040	2796560	I do not care for Grogu.
2796560	2801960	I'm tired of seeing Grogu every fucking where, and I hate that there's a big fucking massive
2801960	2804200	one in my game.
2804200	2808360	They could have just like made a little one in the little pod somewhere and not have this
2808360	2810640	big thing staring at me.
2810640	2811640	I'm sorry.
2811640	2812640	He looks like a booger.
2812640	2815480	Are you going to open up the cabinet and put a little paper bag over his face?
2815480	2822120	Am I on it, but he's not as, he doesn't offend me as much as the head in fun house.
2822120	2823120	Okay.
2823120	2824120	Oh yeah.
2824120	2825120	Oh yeah.
2825120	2826120	That thing is scary.
2826120	2827120	Yeah.
2827120	2833740	I, I, I'm, I'm perfectly fine with the skull and no fear because uh, that was a Steve Ritchie
2833740	2834740	doing its voice.
2834740	2835740	That was fine.
2836140	2843420	I, I, but I love when I'm playing of listening to the music and Bobby makes a good point.
2843420	2848540	Um, he doesn't move and I love that.
2848540	2849540	So you know he's not going in there.
2849540	2853900	All right, Brad, his name is not fucking baby Yoda and that pisses me off more than the
2853900	2857220	character's existence.
2857220	2858220	Just saying.
2858220	2860460	It's not even fucking funny.
2860460	2861700	So yeah, I played that.
2861940	2869020	What I love is that the, the overall theme song plays and the sound effects and the videos
2869020	2875420	that play, they go quite well with, um, the various modes in the game.
2875420	2881180	You know, I, I absolutely, I absolutely love it.
2881180	2885340	I'm glad that we traded, uh, monster bash for it.
2885340	2887740	Um, I didn't care for monster bash that much.
2887780	2893500	You know, the kind of, you know, B movie monster theme never really just sat with me.
2893500	2901500	Um, but, uh, oh yeah, Bobby, it was probably me, uh, you know, from 3000 miles away with
2901500	2902500	my mind.
2902500	2903500	It's wild.
2903500	2905420	The spotlight that shines on the child fell out of my cab.
2905420	2907500	Now I see it was dark soccer is doing.
2907500	2908780	Which also means star soccer.
2908780	2912340	You can remove it without ruining the game.
2912340	2917380	Um, uh, it is wild to me that you and Bobby have the same pinball machine now.
2917380	2918500	It's just, I don't know why.
2918500	2920020	And mine just happened.
2920020	2921020	Yeah.
2921020	2924100	He was talking about it on his show tonight and was showing a B roll of putting it together
2924100	2925100	and all this.
2925100	2927380	Well, you know, as much as you'd like put together one of those things, but kind of
2927380	2929180	like showing the ins and outs of it, it was, it was neat.
2929180	2934940	I certainly encourages his, uh, uh, archive broadcast to you guys to check out the machine
2934940	2935940	and putting it all together.
2935940	2940380	Um, yeah, I have the forest and I do, it's interesting to me that you guys have the same
2940380	2941380	thing.
2941380	2942380	It's just wild.
2942380	2947900	Um, also I put up a Tik TOK earlier, just, you know, of after my game, just, you know,
2947900	2951700	basically showing in general what it looks like in my garage.
2951700	2954460	Um, and I'm going to go ahead and bring this up.
2954460	2959060	So since I'm doing GISH this month, the grave international scavenger hunt, uh, actually
2959060	2964540	this week, one of our challenges is to have a Mandalorian crossing guard.
2964540	2968540	And I was just thinking of putting a big stop sign on top of my pinball and submitting that
2968540	2969540	as a joke.
2969540	2970980	There you go.
2970980	2980380	I don't know if it'd count, but yeah, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, it's really fun.
2980380	2981820	It was, it was worth it.
2981820	2986580	I mean, we weren't going to buy it at first and since the trade happened, we're just completely
2986580	2987580	down for it.
2987580	2990580	And yeah, so we have a, we have the pro edition.
2990580	2991580	Cool.
2991580	2998100	One day, I'll have a pinball machine one day, but I'm also still playing word scapes because
2998100	3003880	I'm, I'm addicted to, to words and spelling and all of that stuff.
3003880	3013060	And of course, Fantasian, um, I finally got my, my guys, uh, my team, I'm playing with,
3013060	3014660	with the guy team right now.
3014660	3023620	So they're all leveled and, um, I beat the intermediary boss who you think is the main
3023620	3025740	bad guy that isn't.
3025740	3030660	I've been calling him robot Vincent because he kind of has like that style of Vincent
3030660	3032180	from final fantasy seven.
3032180	3033180	Okay.
3033180	3036940	Um, actually I've been calling him Vomson too, cause his name is Vom.
3036940	3045300	Um, but yeah, I, I've had a great time, uh, with that game and I'm getting on to a bit
3045300	3048180	further on to the end of the, of the game.
3048180	3053180	And so I'm again, trying to think of what I'm going to do when Fantasian is over.
3053820	3055780	Um, but there's going to be a Fantasian too.
3055780	3059620	So I'm looking forward to that eventually coming out on Apple arcade.
3059620	3060620	Nice.
3060620	3061620	Yeah.
3061620	3063620	All right, Rob, I think you would enjoy it.
3063620	3064620	It's really fun.
3064620	3066620	I need to play it at some point.
3066620	3070120	Um, it's pretty, there's a lot of games I'm juggling.
3070120	3071120	That's all I'll get.
3071120	3076240	Well, like the general fighting and navigating through the game is pretty easy, but those
3076240	3080540	boss battles, they require some planning.
3080540	3081540	That's all I'll say about it.
3081540	3082540	Fair enough.
3082900	3083900	All right.
3083900	3084900	Anything else to share?
3084900	3085900	Um, yeah.
3085900	3086900	All right.
3086900	3091780	Um, so for my gaming week, I had a lot of time to play games this week cause, um, and
3091780	3095700	I think I talked about this on last week's show, but I had a surgery on Wednesday.
3095700	3098700	So, um, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.
3098700	3104300	And um, I guess, I guess I could, it's, it's, my neck was worked on, so I had that bump
3104300	3108020	on my neck to remove and just, uh, I'm going to give a content warning.
3108020	3110480	I am going to turn around and show it it's bandaged.
3110480	3113980	It shouldn't look too bad, um, but just if that's a woozy thing for you, just avert your
3113980	3114980	eyes for a moment.
3114980	3117640	I'll tell you when I'm facing front again, but I'm going to turn around so you can see
3117640	3121160	it here and, um, you can see it's, it's pretty large.
3121160	3122840	Um, hold on, sorry.
3122840	3126320	And I apologize to the podcast listeners cause you can't see this part, but I'm going to
3126320	3129080	quickly have a moment of silence while I turn around and show you that.
3129080	3131760	Um, I'll talk.
3131760	3133560	So Rob has turned around.
3133560	3141320	He's got a big gauze of about maybe two inches, uh, in, uh, width on the back of his neck.
3141320	3143560	Maybe about one inch in height.
3143560	3146120	Um, and I turned and I turned back around.
3146120	3147120	It's safe now.
3147120	3148440	I was giving the, the play by play.
3148440	3149440	I know.
3149440	3150440	I know.
3150440	3151440	I know.
3151440	3152440	Just for the folks who have read it.
3152440	3153440	But honestly it's not, it's not gross.
3153440	3154440	I mean, it's a bandage.
3154440	3155440	Yeah.
3155440	3157000	So you can't really see under the bandage right now.
3157000	3158040	So I'm sure it's still Healey.
3158040	3160000	There's at least 10 stitches in there.
3160000	3161520	Cause I asked how many stitches did you do?
3161520	3165760	And he kind of chuckled and he went at least 10, I will say this.
3165760	3171840	It was not a pleasant experience, but honestly, like I, I, it was interesting as we talk about
3171840	3178000	all these like traumas and things, I definitely like for like two hours after the surgery,
3178000	3183040	I felt completely, I just can't believe I was awake for it because just the whole fact
3183040	3191800	that I could like feel what, what was happening and like when I, yeah, I, I, in fact even
3191800	3194320	trying to describe it now is, is causing me in some sort of way.
3194320	3197620	So I'm like, it just, it was a lot, it was very intense.
3197620	3202240	And so, um, I, I was just like in shock for like two hours after, uh, thankfully a lot
3202240	3203240	of that settled down.
3203240	3209960	Um, but I just like just having yourself literally opened up on the table while you're awake.
3209960	3212720	Did you tell people what exactly it was that was removed?
3212720	3213720	Oh yeah.
3213720	3214720	I had a lipoma.
3214720	3215720	Um, yeah.
3215720	3221280	So if anyone watches Dr Pimple Popper, it was that I watched lots of lipomas coming
3221280	3222280	out of people.
3222280	3226400	I, and see, I can't watch that stuff and especially not my mom's addicted to.
3226400	3228920	They actually asked me after they were like, do you want to see it?
3228920	3231960	And I, I, I thought for a second, I, I think that was just me.
3231960	3234120	I said, no, I don't want to see it.
3234120	3236040	So I'll never know what it looked like.
3236040	3237560	And I'll tell you this, Rob.
3237560	3238560	Yeah.
3238560	3240480	Your eyes actually don't look that gross.
3240480	3245880	Um, I looked at before I had the surgery when I was looking at the information about it.
3245880	3251040	So I did see like what it is, but I, they're like chunky pudding.
3251040	3252040	Yeah.
3252040	3253040	I didn't want to see it after that.
3253040	3254040	So anyway.
3254040	3255040	Yeah.
3255040	3258800	Um, but the good news is, sorry, I mean, look, here I am.
3258800	3259800	I'm doing the show.
3259800	3260800	I'm back to normal.
3260800	3261800	I feel it back there.
3261800	3265920	Um, that's why if you see me touching my neck a lot during the show, it's at that part where
3265920	3268000	it's getting a little itchy in that area.
3268000	3271080	So I just kind of have to like softly kind of like, I'm itching it, but I'm not really
3271080	3272400	itching it type of thing.
3272400	3276560	So, uh, because it's going to be, I think they said 10 days before the bandages kind
3276560	3279400	of come off naturally and the dissolving stitches and all that.
3279400	3284900	Um, so Rob, I'll offer you a suggestion because I've had many a surgery in places that get
3284900	3285900	really itchy.
3285900	3286900	Yeah.
3286900	3294560	Um, I have this lotion, um, now it's not cheap, but I have the CeraVe version, but they'll
3294560	3297900	often call it like Sarna or something.
3297900	3299900	And it's really good for just like stopping an itch.
3299900	3303860	But I also was using lidocaine spray, like the, what you spray on the sunburn.
3303860	3306340	That is apparently the anesthesia they use too is lidocaine.
3306340	3307340	Oh yeah.
3307340	3308340	They use lidocaine.
3308340	3309740	They just use a much stronger version of it.
3309740	3315980	But I mean, if you like get the cheapo lidocaine, you know, uh, sun spray stuff, like just get
3315980	3319860	one that's like, you know, unscented, plain lidocaine, like the thing is something like
3319860	3322220	4% lidocaine in solution.
3322220	3326860	But that'll help quite a bit with, with the itchiness and it won't, it won't really hurt
3326860	3327860	your stitches.
3327860	3331180	I actually think I have some of that aloe vera with lidocaine stuff.
3331180	3332940	Um, you want just lidocaine.
3332940	3334340	You don't want to put the aloe in it.
3334340	3335340	Okay.
3335340	3336340	I guess that's good to know.
3336340	3337340	Cause I would have went to that.
3337340	3338340	Trust me.
3338340	3341940	I popped a stitch once.
3341940	3342940	It wasn't bad.
3342940	3348100	I just put like liquid bandage on it and it, cause they had used a skin glue for me, but
3348100	3349100	it wasn't bad.
3349100	3355940	I, I don't know what they used because I swear I felt him tying knots, but they use a dissolving
3355940	3359620	stitch and usually cover it with, um, what's it called?
3359620	3360620	Skin bond.
3360620	3362780	I think that's basically liquid stitches.
3362780	3363780	That's what's going on back here.
3363780	3364780	Yeah.
3364780	3365780	Yeah.
3365780	3368860	So anyway, so it's just a much stronger version of the liquid bandage.
3368860	3369860	Yeah.
3369860	3370860	Anyway.
3370860	3371860	Sorry.
3371860	3373820	I don't mean to talk about the surgery all night, but, but just, it was seven centimeters
3373820	3377820	big is how long the, cause the nice thing about my insurance, you can go on and look
3377820	3378820	at all the posts.
3378820	3382180	I can go read the post-op notes that I did do because that's just reading.
3382180	3383180	There's no pictures.
3383180	3384180	We're through the same place, right?
3384180	3385180	Yeah.
3385420	3386420	Yeah.
3386420	3387420	So I love that.
3387420	3388420	I absolutely love that.
3388420	3389420	Isn't it fascinating?
3389420	3390420	Well, yeah.
3390420	3392820	And I, you know, I used to work in healthcare on the administrative side of it and I would
3392820	3394940	see those types of notes all the time.
3394940	3397300	So it's kind of interesting to read them now when they're about you.
3397300	3398300	Yeah.
3398300	3401300	So anyway, enough of that.
3401300	3402300	All right.
3402300	3408220	Um, but I, because of all that, I, I mean, I was still kind of working, but, um, kind
3408220	3409400	of some short days.
3409400	3412280	So I was playing a lot of video games, just kind of relax and recuperate.
3412280	3417000	So the game that was really taken up the most of my time that I was playing was Yakuza
3417000	3420200	Like a Dragon, which I've talked about previous weeks on this show.
3420200	3422040	I am all the way up to goofy.
3422040	3423040	What's that?
3423040	3424040	That game is goofy.
3424040	3425040	It is.
3425040	3426040	It is.
3426040	3427040	But it's so, it's so fun.
3427040	3428980	Uh, I'm up to chapter 11 now in that game.
3428980	3431660	So just to give you some, cause I think the last time I talked about it, I was like chapter
3431660	3432660	four or five.
3432660	3434360	I'm going to chapter 11 now in the game.
3434360	3440460	Um, and a lot has happened and I just, I'll say I, I am, the story is so good.
3440460	3442420	Like it's like, it's like I'm watching a Netflix show.
3442420	3443420	It really is.
3443420	3448220	Uh, all these chapters could be episodes of a Netflix show and I'm at the point now where
3448220	3455760	finally little hints that are dropped in the earlier parts of the story are coming back.
3455760	3461220	But I love how Yakuza remind you just enough.
3461220	3465340	Like it will, it will like, like let's say they're talking about an obscure, I shouldn't
3465340	3469620	say obscure, but let's say a character that was around in chapters one and two suddenly
3469620	3472180	comes back in chapter 10 or 11.
3472180	3475980	You will get like a little flashback where like you get a little photo on the screen
3475980	3480280	that shows you that moment from chapter one or two so you can go, Oh yeah, that, you know,
3480280	3483780	and for me who has a bad memory to begin with, I need a lot of that stuff and it's really
3483780	3488060	good for me to be able to kind of keep along with the story and they do it just enough
3488060	3490220	so they're not like hitting you over the head with it.
3490220	3491900	Um, which I think is great.
3491900	3496100	So yeah, the way they, the way they story tell it, um, is really good.
3497060	3499940	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Hey Rob, you should play Yakuza like a dragon.
3499940	3503740	I can't believe nobody out there would tell me to play this series.
3503740	3509780	Why, why, why would, why would none of you out there say, play Yakuza, play literally
3509780	3511980	any of those games, play them.
3511980	3513460	No, nobody would do that for me.
3513460	3514860	I can't believe it.
3514860	3519940	Anyway, I hope you all hear my tongue in cheek cause many of you have said to play this series
3519940	3520940	over the years.
3520940	3523140	I finally did it and I'm loving it.
3523140	3527900	My one little complaint about the game is that I'm getting to the point where battles
3527900	3529900	are feeling very grindy.
3529900	3530900	I get it.
3530900	3535660	It's a JRPG battles are supposed to be grindy, but because the animations are so over the
3535660	3541660	top, because I don't always want to let the computer control things because it's not the
3541660	3544780	smartest AI they'll use up my good items.
3544780	3550580	If I'm not careful, um, I have to kind of sit there and it gets, it gets a little repetitive.
3550660	3554380	Um, especially because I just got to a point, I don't want to spoil anything.
3554380	3557300	I'll just say the difficulty just went up like a lot.
3557300	3562020	Um, and I was, I wasn't ready for it, so I'm having to go back and kind of like grind stuff
3562020	3565540	and that part is not very, um, exciting.
3565540	3572500	Um, but I imagine not, yeah, but the story is so good, it's compelling me enough to push
3572500	3573500	through.
3573500	3577940	Um, but I haven't, I like a game like that, but sometimes you have to suffer for your
3577940	3578940	enjoyment.
3578980	3583620	And like, it's, it's also interesting because the main story is very serious and then all
3583620	3589420	the sub quests are where all the sophomoric potty humor stuff shows up.
3589420	3593420	Um, like the, the, the guys dressing up as babies and those sorts, that's all the side
3593420	3594420	quest stuff.
3594420	3598620	So it's, it's interesting how you literally have comic relief for side quests.
3598620	3600660	Uh, it's just, it's interesting to me.
3600660	3603660	So, um, so anyway, yes, I recommend the game.
3603660	3604660	It's on game pass.
3604660	3607700	That's how I finally was like, all right, shut up everybody.
3608100	3611380	Cause it's not going to cost me anything outside of what I'm already paying.
3611380	3612960	So that's how I finally did it.
3612960	3615780	And now I'm like, all right, day one for the seat.
3615780	3619460	That's how game pass getcha because now I'm like, all right, day one for the sequel.
3619460	3620460	I'm getting it.
3620460	3621460	Absolutely.
3621460	3623380	Cause the sequel is going to be, uh, going to be fire.
3623380	3629060	I know that anyway, um, other games I've been playing this week cause it hasn't just been
3629060	3630060	about that.
3630060	3631660	I've also been playing dead by daylight.
3631660	3632660	Here's the weird thing.
3632660	3640500	I played on PC and I played on Xbox because I needed to get achievements and I was like,
3640500	3644580	Oh, my rank on dead by daylight fell all the way back to 20.
3644580	3650340	This is the best time to do adept achievements because you get match made with all the other
3650340	3651960	baby players.
3651960	3657220	And since I'm on consoles, but I do not have to feel bad one bit if somebody's on the hook
3657220	3660260	and I just opened the door and let myself out.
3660260	3661260	I don't care.
3661260	3664180	Like, you know what?
3664180	3665180	Sorry that happened to you.
3665180	3671160	I was in a match though, where there was a baby nurse killer and the other three were
3671160	3677700	very clearly a Swift and it was me and these three kept flashlighting the hell out of this
3677700	3678700	nurse.
3678700	3681100	But because they were doing that, they weren't doing any gens.
3681100	3682720	So I'm running from gen to gen and doing it.
3682720	3683720	And you know what?
3683720	3686560	Two of them died because all they were doing was hook trading.
3686560	3689460	And then one of them got hooked and I was like, you know what?
3689460	3691400	When you do clownery, the clown come back to bite.
3691400	3697420	And I left like, if you didn't want that clownery, do a gen.
3697420	3699060	So I played dead by daylight.
3699060	3700820	And then I also played, of course, Final Fantasy 14.
3700820	3702820	I've been playing a lot of that.
3702820	3706780	And then another brand new ish game that I played this week.
3706780	3712580	I played flight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator just came out for the Xbox.
3712580	3717340	So the Xbox Series X version and Series S version of the game just came out.
3717340	3722060	Although I dabbled a little bit on PC, I think I said after I played the PC, I can't
3722060	3727940	wait for the Xbox version because it's going to dumb it down for controllers to a level
3727940	3729620	where I'll be able to play it better.
3729620	3732460	And I have mixed feedback on that.
3732460	3735060	They didn't actually really dumb it down.
3735060	3738700	There's still, they packed a lot of stuff into the controller.
3738700	3743740	So much so that like, I kind of have a hard time without the on-screen instructions and
3743740	3747780	stuff to like, still like, you know, do a smooth takeoff and all of that.
3747780	3752420	But it's very easy to have the AI takeover.
3752420	3755060	And there's a very rich tutorial in the game.
3755060	3759940	And there's a really cool little mode where you can just go in and there's some certain
3759940	3762900	pre-selected areas and pre-selected flights.
3762900	3765940	And it's just, okay, it's going to plop you in San Francisco.
3765940	3768540	The plane is already in the air and go.
3768540	3769540	Now you're taking over the plane.
3769540	3771300	You can just explore San Francisco.
3771300	3775700	And that's some of the coolest stuff that's in the game.
3775700	3777700	I keep saying game.
3777700	3779260	There's not really a game here.
3779260	3786980	I mean, you can kind of make your own game such as I'm going to fly in real time from
3786980	3790760	my house to this airport that's a hundred miles away or even further.
3790760	3793240	And I'm going to do a real time flight.
3793240	3794780	There's not really a game.
3794780	3800960	I mean, I guess the lessons kind of make up a game because the later lessons actually
3800960	3801960	have you do that.
3801960	3804200	It has you do flights from start to finish.
3804200	3806860	So I guess that's the game.
3806860	3810640	But I think we can all kind of identify that is a little weak.
3810640	3815480	However, it doesn't matter with a game like this.
3815480	3821280	I really think a lot of this is just like that experience of being able to explore the
3821280	3822980	world.
3822980	3823980	And it's beautiful.
3823980	3826400	Like the graphics in this game are incredible.
3826400	3830080	It is 4K and it looks great.
3830080	3835220	The very first thing I did in this game was I flew an airplane out of SAC Executive, not
3835220	3838480	the international airport, but the executive because it's a little closer.
3838480	3841860	And I flew over my house because I wanted to see it.
3841860	3845920	And it was really cool, a cool thing to experience.
3845920	3853220	And yeah, I feel like if you're the type of person that can sit on Google Earth and look
3853220	3859200	at places far away and go, ooh, or if you like to do like Street View or if you've ever
3859200	3863240	played Geo Guesser and you're into that, I feel like Flight Simulator is going to be
3863240	3866220	your jam because that's that's what it is.
3866220	3871960	It's just putting a new spin on Google Earth, I guess, except it's Bing Earth and making
3871960	3874420	it beautiful.
3874420	3877120	It's it's great.
3877120	3880920	Looking in chat, as Joan Hunter-Matt says, Flight Simulator is so pretty and easier on
3880920	3881920	the controller.
3881920	3884160	It's still tough because you have to be very precise with your movements.
3884160	3888040	Yes, you can't just pull down on the thumb stick to tilt the plane up.
3888040	3889040	No, no, no.
3889880	3894400	You have to gently, gently push down a little bit to get the right amount of movement.
3894400	3898760	So it does challenge some of the conventional video game ways of thinking, that's for sure.
3898760	3903680	Bobby Black Wolf says, I stalled trying to fly over Everest.
3903680	3908040	I crashed into the Yosemite because I was flying around Yosemite because one of the
3908040	3909040	flights is Half Dome.
3909040	3910540	You can just start right there.
3910540	3912640	And it said that there were like animals on the ground.
3912640	3915720	I was trying to get close to the ground because I wanted to see the animals and I crashed
3915720	3916720	the plane.
3917720	3920680	I'm only laughing because I think I would do that, too.
3920680	3921680	You know what, though?
3921680	3926760	I will say it does it in a tasteful way when you crash the plane.
3926760	3929080	The music in the game is really good.
3929080	3931920	The music soundtrack in the game is very, very good.
3931920	3936240	I feel like I'm on Soren at the Disneyland ride.
3936240	3939240	I feel like I'm on Soren when I play Flight Simulator.
3939240	3944220	But if you crash, there's no explosion or anything graphic.
3944220	3948660	It just instantly goes to black and you hear this little like, like a drum beat that goes
3948660	3949980	doo, doo, doo, doo.
3949980	3953980	And it instantly goes to black and just goes, you have sustained critical damage and have
3953980	3955240	broken your plane.
3955240	3961820	And then the music instantly goes sad because you crashed the plane.
3961820	3968420	So it's very tastefully and artistically done, actually, I will say, because, you know, there's
3968420	3972820	people out there that are going to be like, oh, I'm going to just, you know, try to crash
3972820	3976120	into the airport and see what happens.
3976120	3977120	Nothing happened.
3977120	3978120	Nothing happened.
3978120	3979120	It's artistic.
3979120	3980120	It's artistic.
3980120	3981120	This will happen.
3981120	3982120	It's done very artfully.
3982120	3983120	So, yeah.
3983120	3986580	As she says, I did enjoy just flying around places I've lived or been to.
3986580	3987580	Yeah.
3987580	3988580	I flew around my own town.
3988580	3989980	I did the San Francisco thing.
3989980	3991940	I flew Vegas at night.
3991940	3994060	I thought that would be a fun flight to do.
3994060	3999820	I flew down because I took one of the little like prop planes practically and flew down
3999820	4001680	the strip of Vegas at night.
4001680	4003440	And I thought that was a lot of fun.
4003440	4004520	Bobby will be proud of me.
4004520	4005680	I did Atlanta.
4005680	4011400	I did a flight at a Hartsfield Jackson and tried to find the Dragon Con hotels and did
4011400	4012400	that.
4012400	4013920	So that was fun, too.
4013920	4017160	And Bobby says, I flew to my college and landed in the state.
4017160	4018160	Oh, I did Disneyland.
4018160	4019420	I tweeted that one.
4019420	4026520	So I flew out of John Wayne Airport and tried to find Disneyland, which actually wasn't
4026520	4029960	as easy as it sounds because it isn't.
4029960	4034560	It does label a lot of points of interest, but probably due to licensing or whatever,
4034560	4036840	they don't have Disneyland as a point of interest.
4036840	4039300	You can find the town of Anaheim.
4039300	4043760	But as we all know, even though Disneyland is in the town of Anaheim, there's a lot more.
4043760	4045200	So I had to kind of find it.
4045200	4047040	I kind of had to go, OK, there's the freeway.
4047040	4049360	You just have to go down five.
4049360	4052020	Yeah, but which of these freeways is five?
4052020	4054200	It takes you a minute to kind of find that, right?
4054200	4055560	And then I was like, OK, I found it.
4055600	4059680	And there's a lot of trees, which because I would have thought, oh, you just look for
4059680	4062680	the Matterhorn and that's how you find Disneyland because that's what you do when you're in
4062680	4063680	the car, right?
4063680	4065760	You find the Matterhorn.
4065760	4070040	But when you're up in the air that high, the Matterhorn doesn't really stick out because
4070040	4071400	you're really high up.
4071400	4072400	So anyway.
4072400	4073400	Yeah.
4073400	4074400	Yeah.
4074400	4078320	S.J. 100 Matt says, I flew around New York City and that was a lot of fun, although I
4078320	4080840	noticed they didn't include the Freedom Tower.
4080840	4084600	I did notice the imagery is a couple of years old.
4084640	4090200	So to use a local example, sorry, but for Dark Soccer's benefit, I found you can actually
4090200	4092800	fly out of a grass field in Clarksburg.
4092800	4094360	I thought that was kind of cool.
4094360	4095360	So I did.
4095360	4098160	Yeah, I did a flight from there to like downtown.
4098160	4101680	But I noticed as I was flying up five, I was like, OK, there's the Sacramento Tower and
4101680	4104640	that, oh, the Delta Shores isn't there.
4104640	4106940	So the whole Delta Shores isn't there.
4106940	4108120	It's just an empty.
4108120	4113200	It looks like it's been like like a lot that's being prepped for something.
4113200	4114720	But that's all that's there.
4114720	4115720	And the early days.
4115720	4118800	That's a big shopping complex here locally in the area that's been open.
4118800	4123200	It's been around probably two, three years at this point, but it's not in the imagery.
4123200	4126160	So it is a little bit dated.
4126160	4132120	But I did find you can go into the DLC and there's all sorts of like free stuff.
4132120	4133720	I guess they're user mods.
4133720	4139120	And there was some U.S. update thing that was like four gigs that said it would update
4139120	4141760	like 40 airports and certain landmarks.
4141760	4143240	So I downloaded that.
4143240	4147660	So I wonder if there isn't like other stuff that might update the OK.
4147660	4150660	Bobby Lockwood says the U.S. world update is from Microsoft.
4150660	4153680	So I did grab that for what it's worth.
4153680	4156040	And Bobby says the satellite imagery is old.
4156040	4159780	The Georgia Dome is there and the Mercedes Benz Stadium is still dirt and Turner Field
4159780	4162560	is still the baseball stadium and Truist Park is woodland.
4162560	4164080	That means nothing to me.
4164080	4169060	But for those of you local in that area, it gives you an idea.
4169060	4170060	But that's OK.
4170060	4175140	I don't mind that the imagery is slightly old because it's it's enough close enough.
4175140	4183340	So, yeah, I just again, if you are a Google Earth or geoguessr or I'm exploring a town
4183340	4187440	in street view because it's fun type of thing, like it's a very specific type of nerdom.
4187440	4191340	And I am very much into that flight simulator is absolutely for you.
4191340	4195780	But I do think there's some people that are going to go, wow, I just downloaded 100 gig
4195780	4196780	game.
4196780	4199720	That's not even a game.
4199720	4204320	I hate to say flight simulator is probably not for you, but I think it's still worth
4204320	4205320	checking out.
4205320	4209440	Just just if you want an impressive piece of graphical thing for your Xbox Series X,
4209440	4210440	do it.
4210440	4211440	No.
4211440	4212440	All right.
4212440	4213440	All right.
4213440	4214440	Well, I can't do it.
4214440	4216800	Well, no, not not yet.
4216800	4217800	Some days.
4217800	4223120	Well, yeah, you don't even really have because you're doing everything on Mac.
4223120	4227360	But I'm almost positive this will be on Microsoft Cloud.
4227360	4234840	So in the future, you could maybe maybe Stadia might do something that be nice.
4234840	4237020	It's a Microsoft first party title.
4237020	4238020	So they'll probably.
4238020	4239020	I'm not going to.
4239020	4240020	Yeah, I get anything.
4240020	4241020	And you too.
4241020	4242020	I get it.
4242020	4243020	All right.
4243020	4245240	OK, so that's it for my gaming week.
4245240	4247960	Oh, I guess I should get in just a couple of quick housekeeping things and then we'll
4247960	4249960	get into the news that's going on tonight.
4249960	4251820	So just a couple of quick things.
4251820	4257000	So the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is coming up and it's the weekend of August 20th.
4257000	4261240	If I remember correctly, that is in the Atlanta metro area.
4261240	4263520	Vogue Network is sponsoring that.
4263520	4264800	And Bobby Black Wolf will be there.
4264800	4266720	I will not be, unfortunately.
4266720	4270960	So if you're in the area and you feel OK to do that because I realize this is a weird
4270960	4272000	year and all that stuff.
4272000	4274080	So everybody has to make their own choice of that.
4274080	4277640	So we're going to do we're going to do a low pressure ad this time.
4277640	4280180	I'm just going to let you know it's a thing that's happening.
4280180	4282240	If you'd like to go, great.
4282240	4286720	And you can check out their website for all the updated health policies and things of
4286720	4290800	that nature so you can see if it's something you would be interested in.
4290800	4295200	Another convention also in the Atlanta area that we will be at, I will be at as well as
4295200	4297280	Bobby Black Wolf is Dragon Con.
4297280	4299960	Dragon Con is coming up over Labor Day weekend.
4299960	4303080	And the policies for that did come out today.
4303080	4308480	And so I am very relieved to see that they will be mandating masks for everybody, regardless
4308480	4310680	of vaccination status.
4310680	4315520	And they did cap the attendance at half, basically, of what they had in prior years.
4315520	4317240	So I'm so glad I didn't bother.
4317240	4320260	I understand, you know, everybody's got to make their own call.
4320260	4322680	But for me, I'm ready.
4322680	4327040	So and I'm going to be doing six panels throughout the weekend.
4327040	4333880	So it's going to be a different year, but that's part of the uniqueness of it, I think.
4333880	4338400	So, yeah, I haven't traveled in a long time.
4338400	4340080	So it'll be it'll be nice to do that.
4340080	4341520	So that'll be over Labor Day weekend.
4341520	4344960	So if you happen to be going, please say hi.
4344960	4347760	If you need six feet of space, I completely understand.
4347760	4349880	All right.
4349880	4350880	That's it.
4350880	4352740	I guess we can get into some gaming news now.
4352740	4353740	So let's do it.
4353740	4354740	All right.
4354740	4355740	All right.
4355740	4360280	I'm going to start off tonight and I will talk about the PlayStation 5 system software
4360280	4361280	update.
4361280	4364140	So there is a new beta version of PlayStation 5 system software.
4364140	4369640	And the big thing about this software updated is actually expanding SSD support.
4369640	4373720	So if you're in the PlayStation 5 beta program, so they actually have like a beta interface
4373720	4382520	program, this new software beta 2.0-04 is .0000, that is rolling out to folks.
4382520	4387720	And this is where you're going to be able to use your own M.2 SSD into the PlayStation
4387720	4389600	5 expansion slot.
4389600	4392880	And you can use it for additional storage, which, you know, a lot of people have been
4392880	4397480	complaining about PlayStation 5 and Xbox, quite frankly, is that there's not enough
4397480	4402640	storage for all these games now that there are 100 gigs like Flight Simulator, right?
4402640	4404580	We need more storage.
4404580	4410040	So excuse me, this PlayStation update is going to address that a little bit.
4410040	4412320	However, there are some specifics to this.
4412320	4414600	You can't just use any drive.
4414600	4419720	I would direct you to PlayStation's website to read a little more on this because I can
4419720	4426620	say it, but I don't, you know, for example, you have to use a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDS with a
4426620	4430240	capacity of 250 gigabyte minimum and four terabyte maximum.
4430320	4432960	Okay, maybe you caught all that, but I bet you didn't.
4432960	4439160	So you want to probably go look up the specs before you buy a drive to use with this.
4439160	4442440	And of course, you want to make, don't, don't, don't plug one of these in with the power
4442440	4443440	on.
4443440	4446740	Turn, turn the power off, then do it.
4446740	4451840	Some other updates, 3D audio through the TV speakers.
4451840	4456200	And then there's also some in the home screen for games.
4456200	4460400	If you have different platform versions of the same game installed, they appear separately
4460400	4462180	on your home screen.
4462180	4465240	So different versions of a game are easier to spot.
4465240	4469200	An icon will show you if it's PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4.
4469200	4472160	That should help with some of the issues where people were saying, I was launching the wrong
4472160	4473160	version of the game.
4473160	4476880	I was trying to play No Man's Sky and it kept launching the PS4 version of the game, which
4476880	4480400	is great if I want to do VR, but otherwise I don't need it.
4480400	4483580	So they're separating that out a little bit.
4483580	4488060	And there's some other features as well, you know, some trophy things and so forth.
4488060	4489920	So check that out.
4489920	4493720	If you're in the beta program, if you're not in the beta program, then good news.
4493720	4497020	Other people are testing that for you and you will get that update very soon.
4497020	4500180	It sounds like, I would guess probably in a month or so.
4500180	4503100	So check that out when it comes out.
4503100	4508820	Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 5 just yet, but that might be something that I get in
4508820	4509820	a few more months.
4509820	4514140	I was thinking maybe this holiday, but it might, thanks to this upcoming story Dark
4514140	4519700	Sakura is about to bring us, now I'm like, maybe I could just wait till spring next year.
4519700	4520700	We'll see.
4520700	4523180	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
4523180	4529520	So a lot of people have been looking forward to Horizon Forbidden West as supposed to be
4529520	4530900	coming out on PS5.
4530900	4535860	Well, they're going to have to keep looking forward to it because it has been delayed
4535860	4540220	until first quarter 2022.
4540220	4546560	Before it was actually set to be a holiday release, I said that it's just part of a number
4546560	4552400	of delays that have been completely across the industry, including a few other games
4552400	4556380	like God of War.
4556380	4562900	They're saying that it's due to COVID-19 causing production challenges, having developers work
4562940	4572940	from home, but also that it's just been bumping the games for just completely other reasons
4572940	4573940	as well.
4573940	4576260	So they're still working on it.
4576260	4578600	They're just behind.
4578600	4584440	I feel like we need a little card that we flip to here on the show, the little B roll
4584440	4589420	or whatever with a picture of Miyamoto that says that little quote, the bad game is bad
4589420	4593340	forever and nobody will forget that you delayed a good game.
4593340	4599700	I feel like this needs to be on standby because, you know, apply it in this particular case.
4599700	4605100	But I mean, also at the same time, like I get it, not only has the COVID pandemic made
4605100	4609580	making games that were a very collaborative thing before a little bit harder, but I think
4609580	4616260	probably what's also coming into play here is that most folks reasonably thought once
4616260	4623100	vaccines were available, the pandemic would start to subside.
4623100	4624700	Now I'm just going to leave it at that.
4624700	4625980	You all can fill in the blank.
4625980	4629580	We all know, but that is not what happened.
4629580	4632160	And we all know why that didn't happen.
4632160	4635780	And we're just going to leave it at that for now.
4635780	4640940	And my point is that I bet a lot of these project plans that kind of thought about how
4640940	4646860	are we going to get the game done by Christmas or, you know, the holiday and all this stuff?
4646860	4648580	How are we going to get the game done by then?
4648580	4649580	Probably involved.
4649580	4655460	Well, the good news is we'll be back in the office in June and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
4655460	4656460	Yeah.
4656460	4657460	Cue the clown.
4657460	4658940	Cue the clown car music.
4658940	4662620	We thought we thought.
4662620	4663620	You know what?
4663620	4664620	Hmm.
4664620	4665620	They might.
4665620	4670920	We were supposed to go back to our offices next month and they've delayed us to an unspecified
4670920	4672260	time.
4672260	4674720	So we, I'm not surprised.
4674720	4679360	We were going to have the office open optionally on Monday.
4679360	4682440	Some people are like, like male staff and stuff like that.
4682440	4685400	Some people have to be there and have been here that there that whole time.
4685400	4689280	But it's a very minimal staff that's very spread out massed as you can imagine.
4689280	4693240	They were going to open it up to others who wanted to go in.
4693240	4695440	Like I, I, I, that's what we're like.
4695440	4696440	Yeah.
4696440	4697440	They were going to do that on Monday.
4697440	4700880	They've actually said no, we're not even going to give that option.
4700880	4705920	They've now scaled it back to, you can make an appointment to go get your shit that you
4705920	4709160	haven't been able to get since March of 2020.
4709160	4711480	And that's about all we're going to do right now.
4711480	4720040	And with no specification of when it'll be even just be open to like, I want to, I just
4720040	4722560	want to not be at home for a day.
4722560	4727920	Like I want to go into the, of which there's a lot of people in that category right now,
4727920	4729400	but not going to happen tomorrow.
4729400	4730400	So yeah.
4731400	4739400	Um, honestly, I think everyone was thinking way too, uh, too, what's the word I'm thinking
4739400	4742080	of optimistically?
4742080	4747760	I think, I think with these, um, Delta variant stuff, yeah, it's going to get, it's going
4747760	4753200	to get, uh, for the people who didn't get vaccinated, uh, or can I feel, I feel bad
4753200	4757320	for the people that can't, because there are a very small set of very small set of people
4757320	4762880	that due to other ongoing treatments or certain immunocompositions comp, compromises, can't
4762880	4764760	get immunized.
4764760	4767200	And I feel really bad for those people.
4767200	4768200	Really bad.
4768200	4769200	Yeah.
4769200	4775600	So, um, anyway, Pele Hanumea in chat says, uh, don't wait a hundred hours in the PS Valhalla
4775600	4781480	PS five Valhalla, still OMG on how beautiful in 4k on my QLED and really fast load times.
4781480	4784800	So for what it's worth, I do have Xbox series X.
4784960	4790240	So most of those cross-platform things, um, I I'm, I'm just playing on series X.
4790240	4795200	Um, however, I do realize Sony has their own games.
4795200	4800120	I need to play at some point, including the one dark soccer just mentioned this story
4800120	4805640	says, okay, you have a little bit longer and absolutely by the time final fantasy 16 is
4805640	4809880	out, you know, I'm going to have, I will, I will not miss final fantasy 16 period.
4809880	4814560	I I'm at the point where, you know, thanks to the pandemic and us not taking vacations,
4814600	4820200	I will probably take two or three days of vacation when final fantasy 16 comes out because
4820200	4821200	I'm an adult.
4823760	4824760	I'm an adult.
4825200	4826200	Exactly.
4826800	4827800	All right.
4828920	4832920	Pod culture and chat says Delta is rough, but what the fuck is Epsilon going to be like?
4832920	4837600	They're already up to iota iota iota is where they're up to.
4837600	4844240	Actually, um, some of the variants of concerns have different concerns other than
4844240	4846240	they're more transmissible.
4846240	4849720	So we haven't heard about them as much because they're more isolated to certain parts of
4849720	4850720	the globe.
4850720	4856080	But the good news is vaccines have proven some sort of effectiveness, certainly keeping
4856080	4861880	you out of the hospital on all of them, unless you're like over the age of 80, uh, or have
4861880	4867240	other, you know, like I said, the immunocompromised and those issues going on, uh, that, that,
4867240	4871440	uh, it is even then it's a very, very, very, very, very small amount and the media does
4871440	4877880	kind of fixate too much on that small amount, um, that are vaccinated and still have those
4877880	4882360	types of problems because the vast majority of vaccinated people not having problems.
4882360	4883360	Yeah.
4883360	4884360	Yeah.
4884360	4890640	Even so though, and it's officially out that you can be vaccinated and you can still get
4890640	4891640	it.
4891640	4892640	Yep.
4892640	4900880	So I'm just like, uh, yeah, um, no, I'm going to remain a hermit.
4900880	4901880	Let's see.
4901880	4906080	Uh, looking at the other chat, uh, pod culture and chat says, I hear a kitty.
4906080	4907080	Is it Smush or Midna?
4907080	4908080	It's Smush.
4908080	4909080	Sorry.
4909080	4910080	I don't know what he's on about.
4910080	4914840	Midna's voice is quite a bit different too, so, um, daddy took, other daddy took a Costco
4914840	4915840	trip today.
4915840	4919840	So Smush is probably seeing something that came back from Costco and it's probably going
4919840	4920840	crazy about it.
4920840	4926400	So there is that, um, all right, well, let's move on.
4926400	4928280	Uh, I brought up Final Fantasy.
4928280	4931280	So let's talk about Final Fantasy 14.
4931280	4932280	This is interesting.
4932280	4937240	I, I, I, I learned some things this week because of this story, y'all know, I love Final Fantasy
4937240	4938240	14.
4938240	4942240	I play too much of it and I'm really, I'm really excited for the next expansion.
4942240	4946780	Endwalker is going to be coming out and Endwalker is going to be bringing two new jobs to it.
4946780	4953240	The Sage class and the Reaper class and Final Fantasy 14 kind of has these iconic job, literally
4953240	4958040	iconic job icons that go with the different classes in the game.
4958040	4961800	In fact, some people, some people go so far as to get these tattooed on themselves.
4961800	4965520	Um, but a lot of people have them like with bumper stickers on their car or patches on
4965520	4967280	their backpack and that sort of thing.
4967280	4970920	These icons that represent the job classes that they play.
4970920	4976520	Well, if you started to make some of the, that gear for, um, Endwalker, you're going
4976520	4981720	to have to change it a little bit because it turns out they have changed the Sage icon,
4981720	4984220	uh, for Final Fantasy 14.
4984220	4987300	But it's very interesting the why behind this.
4987300	4992640	They actually went so far, Naoki Yoshida, uh, being they in this case, actually wrote
4992640	4997780	a, uh, another letter, uh, which he's been doing a lot lately, um, addressing like, you
4997780	5001340	know, cause I just talked about this last week, the increased player base in the game.
5001340	5004220	He kind of wrote a letter about that and the challenges they were having.
5004220	5010060	Um, he wrote another letter, uh, about the slight change in the icon for the Sage class.
5010060	5016060	Um, so they have changed it a little bit so that now some of the, so the Sage uses this
5016060	5020980	weapon that's kind of like, um, like these little darts that fly through the air sort
5020980	5021980	of thing.
5021980	5026620	And the way it was represented were these four little darts, excuse me, with little
5026620	5028700	holes in the top of them.
5028700	5036100	But the way they were put together was actually making some folks a little bit anxious because
5036100	5039280	of tripe, trypophobia.
5039280	5045500	I think it's called where trypophobia is basically if you see clusters of holes.
5045500	5049700	So things like, and again, I apologize if I'm talking about things that are going to
5049700	5052740	give you the heebie jeebies, but please understand I'm trying to be educational.
5052740	5057100	Like I got this week, things like honeycombs, right?
5057100	5064100	That can give people the heebie jeebies because they it's, it's that the holes together.
5064100	5066700	And I actually never even really knew that this was a thing.
5066700	5071900	So but, but because I also tweeted about it and I actually got a response where somebody,
5071900	5076700	I think a couple of them actually, where somebody was like, yeah, this is me.
5076700	5079420	And you know, I'm glad, I'm glad he did this.
5079420	5084140	So and they, he changed, they changed, oh he, the team changed the icon.
5084140	5086260	So now they're not all like lined up.
5086260	5090100	They're kind of like tilted in a little bit and the holes in three of them are filled
5090100	5091100	in.
5091100	5093100	So they just, they look a little, it looks a little different now.
5093100	5097500	I think it's a very subtle change, but you know, there were the trolls that came out
5097500	5100180	and said, the old one looked better.
5100180	5107820	You know, the old, I already had stuff made up for the old one, whatever, get over it.
5107820	5111140	You could live in your special little snowflake cloud and all that stuff.
5111140	5112140	Congratulations.
5112140	5114460	You know, no one cares.
5114460	5117460	It's that Jurassic Park meme where, look, look at this guy.
5117460	5118460	Look, nobody cares.
5118460	5121620	But you know, the old no one cur.
5121620	5122620	Yeah.
5122620	5123780	But you know, she, and again, distress.
5123780	5126540	I'm saying that to the people that are like the old one was better.
5126540	5130260	I'm not saying that to the people that had, which I never realized was the thing.
5130260	5132900	And now I learned, I was like, oh, okay, well that's neat.
5132900	5139380	You know, Final Fantasy XIV has really made a name for itself in how accessible it is.
5139380	5141960	It's won awards for its accessibility.
5141960	5147860	And when you see Yoshi P write a letter like this, explaining what they, basically saying
5147860	5151660	this aversion, in the letter, this aversion is known as trypophobia and those who have
5151660	5155740	it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps.
5155740	5164180	Like having a producer of a game explain that it's like, okay, you get what, to tie
5164180	5167900	this to the Activision Blizzard thing a little bit, I'm sorry, but I have to, and I'm not
5167900	5170340	pitting XIV against wow.
5170340	5172140	That's not what I'm doing.
5172140	5176780	However, what did I say with that whole thing and other things like it?
5176780	5182840	The culture is defined by the management, right?
5182840	5186840	And you hear about what's going on that we all talked about at the beginning of the show
5186840	5189540	and gross, disgusting, et cetera, and all this.
5189540	5194280	But then you look at Naoki Yoshida and you got to say, now here's a man who deserves
5194280	5195680	a gold star.
5195680	5197880	Here's a man who doesn't just get one piece of glitter.
5197880	5202040	Here's a man who gets the whole star because he acknowledges it.
5202040	5203160	He explains it.
5203160	5205860	And he says, you know what, we need to, sorry.
5205860	5206860	You know what?
5206860	5207860	It was brought to my attention.
5207860	5211760	I think we can change this without like changing the meaning behind it, all this stuff and,
5211760	5214880	and make, you know, make this a little better for some people.
5214880	5216600	And he walks that fucking walk.
5216600	5217840	And you know what?
5217840	5220000	His game is reaping the benefits now.
5220000	5222680	And I say, well deserved.
5222680	5225520	And I don't just say that as a fanboy of Final Fantasy XIV.
5225520	5234200	I say that as a Naoki Yoshida is a great person.
5234200	5235200	Let's see.
5235200	5239240	Dejirama S in chat says certain forms of trypophobia get me, so I'm lucky.
5239240	5241720	I just didn't know this was a thing.
5241720	5244160	That Tigerclaw points out even strawberries can cause it.
5244160	5245160	Yeah.
5245160	5246160	I saw that in some of the articles.
5246160	5247160	Yup.
5247160	5248160	Yup.
5248160	5249160	Yup.
5249160	5250160	Fifth Dream says Yoshi P is just a wholesome dude.
5250160	5251160	Pod culture brings that.
5251160	5252160	And you know what?
5252160	5253160	Somebody in Discord had said this too.
5253160	5256420	I don't know if it's Tigerclaw or what, but was talking about the Xbox Series X.
5256420	5260900	And if you look at the top of a Series X, it has all those holes in it.
5260900	5262080	It's for ventilation.
5262080	5267480	I get the logic behind it, but some sites were running an article about how the Xbox
5267480	5273640	Series X was causing some people issues because of its design.
5273640	5277400	And it's the same thing that's playing into that, which is very interesting.
5277400	5279180	Very, very, very, very interesting.
5279180	5280180	So yeah.
5280180	5284340	And SG100 Matt says it's great when devs listen to their communities and are transparent
5284340	5285340	about it.
5285340	5286340	Yeah.
5286340	5290980	So, you know, and he's not, it's not like he's changing the entire game.
5290980	5296080	He's just, he's changing a thing where he's like, this is an easy fix to like not give
5296080	5300000	certain people anxiety and we can still have the same artistic vision.
5300000	5302200	I'm just going to change it.
5302200	5304200	Cool.
5304200	5306000	That's like, that's a great attitude.
5306000	5309360	We need more of that anyway.
5309360	5314840	So anyway, a big gold star, a golden hug for you, Yoshida.
5314840	5315840	You're a good person.
5315840	5316840	All right.
5316840	5317840	For sure.
5317840	5322400	That's another reason why I will, I will, I will plunk down that money day one for Final
5322400	5326800	Fantasy 16 with him on the team.
5326800	5328920	How can it be bad?
5328920	5334440	Famous last words, but you know what, even, even if it's a bad game, I'll still, which
5334440	5339440	I doubt it will be, but even if it's a, even if it's on the lower end of Final Fantasy
5339440	5343000	games or whatever, I will still say, you know what?
5343000	5344560	I supported a great team.
5344560	5345800	All right.
5345800	5346800	Indeed.
5346800	5347800	Let's move on.
5347800	5348800	Dark Sakura.
5348800	5351720	So how about boring financial stuff?
5351720	5352720	My favorite.
5352720	5353720	Right.
5353720	5358160	But this is actually very notable.
5358160	5368040	Basically the video game industry has taken a really big amount of business in the terms
5368040	5372560	of mergers and acquisitions.
5372560	5375840	Basically record investment ratings in the second quarter.
5375840	5381680	So this is going on the, well, the numbers, just to put it this way.
5381680	5390840	There is a $18.2 billion in mergers and acquisitions and 7.4 billion in investments.
5390840	5399280	So because the market has been so strong in the wake of the pandemic that, you know, and
5399280	5404000	we're seeing the results, we're seeing these companies do buyouts, we're seeing, you know,
5404000	5410000	like one of them, there was an iron source and plays studios.
5410000	5420560	There was a EA purchasing a glue mobile, gearbox being acquired, you know, and just so many
5420560	5421560	things going on.
5421560	5430800	We're hearing more and more like the biggest one was Epic games doing a $1 billion late
5430800	5431800	stage.
5432800	5438680	I mean, of course this is, Epic has also been in other issues going on that could affect
5438680	5444160	them financially that I'm not supposed to talk about.
5444160	5449280	But I mean, we're seeing more and more of this happening.
5449280	5457420	And now what I wonder is that how the recent executive order is going to affect further
5457420	5459800	mergers and acquisitions.
5459800	5462700	I mean, I'm glad to see the investment happen.
5462700	5468840	I'm glad to see, you know, I'm glad to see the industry grow, but I don't want it to
5468840	5472240	grow at the expense of a fair competition, right?
5472240	5477920	You know, if we're gonna have to live in a capitalist society, you may as well cut out
5477920	5478920	the monopoly.
5478920	5479920	Absolutely.
5479920	5480920	Makes sense.
5480920	5481920	Yeah.
5481920	5487200	And you know, what's interesting is that we see a lot of like up and coming, you know,
5488200	5491160	It's interesting because I feel like every time there's a merger, there's people that
5491160	5494800	inevitably leave the company because of the merger and then start up their own studio.
5494800	5501400	And then it's a weird game that's played in the gaming industry is in like these new studios
5501400	5506720	start to come up and some of them end up getting bought, but not all of them do, you know?
5506720	5511520	And I think about a lot of developers, you know, again, thinking of the big story this
5511520	5515680	week about how probably there were a lot of people that left those companies because of
5515680	5516680	those cultures.
5517160	5520520	And I'm not just picking on the one we were talking about earlier, but a lot of the AAA
5520520	5525100	companies and started their own studios and why we have like some really cool companies
5525100	5531480	out there that, you know, like I think of like super giant games and a game like Hades
5531480	5535760	and just like everything that kind of came out of that game and everything is like, I
5535760	5539520	don't know if that studio in particular was started by like disgruntled former employees
5539520	5540520	to it.
5540520	5545600	But it's nice to hear about like these smaller studios kind of coming up and doing taking
5545600	5549040	a different approach to games that oftentimes pays off very, very well.
5549040	5550040	Yeah.
5550040	5555160	But you know that the cycle is going to continue, you know, eventually they're going to be popular.
5555160	5561040	They're going to get bought, you know, it's a big cycle that needs to be be broken.
5561040	5567300	And I'm really curious to see what happens with the with this executive order.
5567300	5572280	I want to see that when everything is going into place, I want to see what these results
5572280	5573280	are.
5573280	5582320	I really think that we're going to start having a bigger sort of thinking of not necessarily
5582320	5589520	that they're all affected as much, but I want to see there be maybe a little bit more equilibrium
5589520	5590520	in the industry.
5590520	5591520	I gotcha.
5591520	5593520	I gotcha.
5593520	5597800	So even though you say, hey, woo, video game investment, I think this is something where
5597800	5601880	it's like, oh, this this this trickles down to the types of games that end up getting
5601880	5603200	made.
5603200	5604200	So right.
5604200	5605200	Big news.
5605200	5610200	Not necessarily trickle down financially because no, not that, but, you know, screw
5610200	5611200	you, Reagan.
5611200	5613200	All right.
5613200	5614200	Moving on.
5614200	5615880	Let's let's talk about kitties.
5615880	5617720	Let's talk about a game about kitties.
5617720	5618720	Yay.
5618720	5620540	Kitties are the best.
5620540	5621540	Maybe that's why Mr. Smoosh came.
5621540	5622540	Oh, he left.
5622540	5623540	I just looked over to where he was sitting.
5623540	5624540	He left.
5624540	5625540	Never mind.
5625540	5626880	He didn't come in for the cat story.
5626880	5630780	But one game that I don't know about you, but it definitely caught my attention when
5630780	5633160	it was shown at one of these advertised a while back.
5633160	5635760	It was it was at the early PlayStation five showcase.
5635760	5638160	I want to say it was actually their announcement showcase.
5638160	5643320	They showed this game called Stray, which was all we really knew at the time is it's
5643320	5645840	a game about cats.
5645840	5647740	And that's kind of all we still know.
5647740	5648920	It's a cat simulator.
5648920	5649920	It's called Stray.
5649920	5655520	But we know when it's coming out, it is coming out in early 2022 and it's going to be coming
5655520	5658960	out for the PC and it's going to be coming out for the PlayStation.
5658960	5663720	And if you want to see more about the game, a gameplay walkthrough just came out this
5663720	5664720	week.
5664720	5669080	So that is actually something you can look at to get a little more sense about what the
5669080	5671720	game really is and so forth.
5671720	5672720	So sorry, I brought it up.
5672720	5675080	I want to see a little bit of it on this computer over here.
5675080	5681460	But you do play as a cat who ends up getting injured and separated from his family.
5681460	5687280	So you use your physical abilities to navigate the environment and solve puzzles partway
5687280	5688400	through the adventure.
5688400	5694200	You meet a drone and then they that drone will let you converse with other robots in
5694200	5697080	the city and interact with objects in the environment.
5697080	5698520	So that's kind of interesting.
5698520	5699520	You can.
5699520	5705240	You can also do fun cat things, scratch furniture, which we all knock shit off.
5705240	5706240	It has to.
5706240	5708080	You can interact with vending machines.
5708080	5711440	You can rub up against the legs of robots that you meet.
5711440	5713520	Nothing yet about knocking shit over.
5713520	5715720	But how can how can that not be involved?
5716160	5718440	Yeah, there's got to be asshole cat mode.
5718440	5719440	There's got to be.
5719440	5725200	Well, don't forget, there's that game on itch.io that was actually it's not called Asshole
5725200	5727200	Cat, is it?
5727200	5730920	But basically, that's what you are a cat and you play an asshole cat.
5730920	5732080	There was cat lateral damage.
5732080	5733080	That's it.
5733080	5734080	Cat lateral damage.
5734080	5735080	That's it.
5735080	5736080	Yeah.
5736080	5737080	Like it's not called Asshole Cat.
5737080	5738080	You know what I'm mixing it up with?
5738080	5742600	I'm mixing it up with Untitled Goose Game, because the reason that is called Untitled
5742600	5746600	Goose Game is because that game was called Asshole Goose or something like that in the
5746600	5747600	beginning.
5747600	5748600	Yeah.
5748600	5749600	And they obviously cannot release a game on intended.
5749600	5751920	Like, you can't release a game called Pixel Shits.
5751920	5756800	So it's called Pixel Poops will get asshole goose became Untitled Goose Game.
5756800	5764320	So anyway, the goose is a big dick.
5764320	5766520	The fifth dream came up with that.
5766520	5768760	We have cat lateral damage for knocking shit over.
5768760	5769760	Yes.
5769760	5773440	And Matt says there is some platforming stuff where you have to knock things over.
5773440	5774440	Good.
5774440	5775440	Good.
5775440	5778160	Pod Culture brings up President Stray, the game.
5778160	5779360	You know what?
5779360	5782720	This is as good as this is as good as it's going to get for President Cat.
5782720	5783720	I'll take it.
5783720	5784720	You know what?
5784720	5785720	President Cat.
5785720	5790000	That news is so 2008, I'll say it.
5790000	5795080	At least we're now in the year in the year 2021, we're finally getting a fucking cat
5795080	5796080	game.
5796080	5797080	I'm excited.
5797080	5798080	All right.
5798080	5799080	Good lord.
5799400	5801400	I'm excited about Stray.
5801400	5802400	All right.
5802400	5803400	Yeah.
5803400	5808080	Let's get let's let's get into a time where not all games are about cats with our next
5808080	5809080	segment.
5820080	5825560	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5825560	5827560	out a classic and tell you about it.
5828040	5831040	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5831040	5834760	And what did you pick for us this week, Arsaka?
5834760	5840200	I picked an arcade game called Lucky and Wild.
5840200	5841520	I have talked about.
5841520	5842920	We always talk about this game.
5842920	5844360	How has this not been a classic game?
5844360	5845360	All right.
5845360	5849920	I went to look and I was like, you know, we brought this game up before, but have we actually
5849920	5850920	done it?
5850920	5851920	And yeah.
5851920	5853240	So it's time.
5853240	5855120	It is time.
5855160	5863600	So Lucky and Wild is a first person racing slash shooter game that was released by Namco
5863600	5867640	in 1993, ran on the Namco System 2 hardware.
5867640	5877200	And it's a throwback to you remember the movie Tango and Cash?
5877200	5878200	I do.
5878200	5881200	Just to give you a heads up, I'm going AFK a quick second bio break.
5881200	5882200	OK.
5882200	5887920	So it has quite a, you know, it also pulls a little bit from Starsky and Hutch as well.
5887920	5898360	So the the way the first person, the first player is called Lucky, who's this debonair
5898360	5905860	guy in a business suit who was named after who was modeled after Starsky and Tango.
5905860	5911480	And he asked to drive the car, accelerate, you know, basically do all that and shoot
5911480	5912880	with a light gun.
5912880	5918480	The second character is called Wild, who is kind of like a surfer guy with the long hair.
5918480	5922920	And he's modeled after Hutch and Cash.
5922920	5926000	And he shoots with just a second light gun.
5926000	5927720	So he doesn't have he doesn't have to drive.
5927720	5929960	I mean, lazy, lazy butthole.
5929960	5936960	Anyway, you have to help the two of them catch six suspects by the names of Jerky, Gambit,
5936960	5942440	Juliora, Heel, Bear and Big Cigar himself.
5942440	5944400	So you go through the stages.
5944400	5950540	You have to fire at enemy cars, destroy their henchmen as well as the cars, stop the projectiles
5950540	5954880	that are fired at you, the usual for a shooting game.
5954880	5960200	When you catch up to the suspect, you have to continuously fire until its energy is depleted
5960200	5963440	and then you will capture the suspect and get a reward.
5963440	5970960	If the the timer runs out, the suspect will escape and you'll see the text got away appearing
5970960	5972740	on the screen.
5972740	5979940	So after each stage, Lucky and Wild drive to the pink cat's garage to get their car
5979940	5987600	repaired and they'll be entertained by young women wearing cattails and ears.
5987600	5989840	Yeah.
5989840	5992480	So yeah, sexism in the industry.
5992480	5999040	Anyway, so there are a few different ways that you can play the game.
5999040	6002260	So one player can drive and another one can shoot.
6002260	6012320	One player can drive with someone else on the gun and someone else on the other gun.
6012320	6015560	One player can drive with another one manning both guns.
6015560	6016880	One player driving.
6016880	6020840	You've got all kinds of like different ways that you can do this or you can have somebody
6020840	6025800	doing both of the guns while driving.
6025800	6032440	Although Namco has never actually put out, though, an official that lets the three people
6032440	6036480	play simultaneously, but people would do it and I've seen it happen.
6036480	6045760	So it was created by Konoe Itaka, who joined Namco in 1991.
6045760	6049920	His first project was Tank Force, which was a sequel to Tank Battalion.
6049920	6054320	He also worked on the original Point Blank and Time Crisis.
6054320	6061520	So when he noticed that the arcades had a lot of young couples playing, he wanted to
6061520	6065200	make a machine that young couples could play.
6065200	6071740	He also noticed that buddy cop movies in Japan were becoming more popular, like movies like
6071740	6074240	Chips and Police Story.
6074240	6078680	And so he made the game.
6078680	6084360	I mean, the title in Japan is called Joe and Paunch, as it was inspired by chips.
6084360	6089520	That always makes me think of Space Ghost Coast to Coast with Moltar.
6089520	6091320	Cool chips.
6091320	6094280	That was always funny.
6094280	6100520	Anyway, he also got some ideas from Sega's Railchase, which was, you know, had the motion
6100520	6105120	based seat that reacted to your actions in the game, like shaking over the rocky roads
6105120	6107780	and stuff like that.
6107780	6112020	And so Lucky and Wild originally had that kind of shape in there, but Namco really wanted
6112020	6117200	to have the light guns with the single shot and the trigger and everything.
6117200	6124780	So eventually there became like this big consensus reached in.
6124780	6126460	This is what came out.
6126460	6134340	It was released in Japan in April 1993 and in May in North America.
6134340	6144140	So there it was it borrowed from other other things.
6144140	6149980	So it had like the American Tuning Car Company brand was in the Ridge Racer games, although
6149980	6153380	it belonged to the muscle cars.
6153380	6159740	The Lucky and Wild protagonists appeared in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX with one person driving
6159740	6161460	in the second being the gunner.
6161460	6162460	Really?
6162460	6163460	Yeah.
6163580	6164580	Wow.
6164580	6165580	I didn't know that.
6165580	6167820	How did I miss that?
6167820	6173660	And in the interactive video series Bear Stearns Bravo, the Bear Stearns CEO Jackie Dalton
6173660	6180860	refers to the regulators Franco and Henry by the name of Lucky and Wild.
6180860	6186140	So Game Machine states that this was the third most popular arcade game in May of 1993 in
6186140	6187420	Japan.
6187420	6192540	Replay states that it was the fourth most popular deluxe arcade game at the time and
6192540	6197420	Play Meter listed it as the twenty fifth most popular arcade game at the time.
6197420	6207540	So it goes along from a different, you know, different places that they'll argue against
6207540	6208540	it.
6208540	6213540	But at any rate, Lucky and Wild, Lucky and Wild.
6213540	6214540	That's it.
6214540	6215540	That's the tweet.
6215540	6219180	I just love that, like, especially as far as Namco is concerned, like there must have
6219180	6224180	been some type of meeting where it's like, OK, do we make another racing game or do we
6224180	6226860	make another time crisis shooting game?
6226860	6227860	And it's all hell.
6227860	6231100	We're going to make both.
6231100	6232660	Why not both at the same time?
6232660	6235580	And here we have Lucky and Wild.
6235580	6247500	I'm trying to actually think of how to say that in Japanese and let me see, but I still
6247500	6251620	see these cabinets around today once in a while.
6251620	6253680	It's a fun game.
6253680	6254680	It's silly.
6254680	6256680	In a good way.
6256680	6258140	All right.
6258140	6265040	So I would I think it's no real whole day when I oh, was that the translation for why
6265040	6266040	not?
6266040	6267040	Why not?
6267040	6268040	Yeah.
6268040	6269040	Yeah.
6269040	6270040	Yeah.
6270040	6271040	Perfect.
6271040	6272040	All right.
6272040	6273040	There it is.
6273040	6274040	Your classic game of the week.
6274040	6275040	Lucky and Wild for the record.
6275040	6277480	Namco just did predate time crisis.
6277480	6279440	Oh, oh, well, still.
6279440	6280440	OK, fine.
6280440	6281440	Then point blank.
6281440	6282440	All right.
6282440	6288120	Which actually might have predated that to know I have to double check time crisis now.
6288120	6289120	Yeah.
6289120	6290120	All right.
6290120	6291120	Anyhow.
6291120	6293360	Well, don't don't get too far into the double checking because we're going to move on.
6293360	6294360	Yeah.
6294360	6295360	Time crisis was nineteen ninety five.
6295360	6296360	All right.
6296360	6297360	My bad.
6297360	6298360	My bad.
6298360	6299360	But Namco had other shooters that existed prior to that.
6299360	6300360	I know point blank for sure.
6300360	6304960	But anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other stories going
6304960	6306320	on in the industry.
6306320	6307320	So I will start.
6307320	6309720	I have a story about the Tokyo Olympics.
6309720	6313360	And last week we were kind of talking about a lot of those video game songs that were
6313360	6314900	used in the opening ceremony.
6314900	6317760	And there was a lot of question about, well, what about Nintendo?
6317760	6318800	Where was Nintendo?
6318800	6324360	Because the warp pipe showed up in the handoff at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.
6324360	6329320	You know, where was the Nintendo presence at the Tokyo Olympics?
6329320	6333040	And some folks were theorizing, you know, they probably pulled out because there's a
6333040	6336720	lot of people in Japan that kind of think the Olympics is bullshit right now.
6336720	6337720	Yeah.
6337720	6339640	So they probably pulled out.
6339640	6344440	And as it turns out, yeah, that's pretty much what happened.
6344440	6345440	But this is as report.
6345440	6347800	So, you know, we don't have it from Nintendo themselves.
6347800	6351560	But this was reported by a Japanese publication, Bunshun.
6351560	6354440	And I don't know, like, are we talking about a National Enquirer?
6354440	6355440	I'm sorry, Bunshun.
6355440	6358680	I don't know if we're talking about like a National Enquirer type of publication or we're
6358680	6361080	talking about something a little more respectable.
6361080	6364960	But there were they are reporting there were last minute changes.
6364960	6368560	Apparently the event was going to have the Legend of Zelda theme, the Mario suite, Kirby
6368560	6369560	Superstar Medley.
6369560	6371280	Oh, sorry, Mike Deft.
6371280	6372760	The Pokemon opening.
6372760	6377120	And also, apparently, Lady Gaga was going to do a gag.
6377120	6379120	Now, she wasn't going to be there.
6379120	6385800	But Lady Gaga was going to like go down into a pipe, a warp pipe in like recorded footage.
6385800	6389720	And Japanese comedian Naomi Wanton be was going to come out.
6389760	6390760	Watanabe.
6390760	6395840	Sorry, Watanabe was going to come out of the pipe as like probably like a Gaga impersonator
6395840	6397600	or something like that.
6397600	6403280	But sadly, the ideas were thrown away because of the controversial statements by the company.
6403280	6406920	You know, they had all the questions, the issues with all those shitty things that were
6406920	6408960	said beforehand.
6408960	6410600	That's why Nintendo pulled out, basically.
6410600	6415040	So I do have to explain a little bit of something about Shukan Bunshun.
6415040	6416080	OK.
6416080	6427520	Is that this magazine has been credited with bringing down a minister and a politician.
6427520	6431960	And it nearly broke up one of Japan's biggest boy bands.
6431960	6439800	So basically, the magazine does exposes and investigative reporting and typically has
6439800	6442200	a lot of clashes with Japanese government.
6442200	6443200	Interesting.
6443200	6444200	OK.
6444200	6449280	This isn't a tabloid.
6449280	6451440	This is like an expose magazine.
6451440	6452440	Interesting.
6452440	6453440	OK.
6453440	6454440	All right.
6454440	6455440	Good to know.
6455440	6456440	Yeah.
6456440	6460800	So it's it's it's a little more Teen Vogue and a little less National Enquire basically
6460800	6461800	or TMZ.
6461800	6462800	Perez.
6462800	6463800	Yeah.
6463800	6464800	Yeah.
6464800	6465800	OK.
6465800	6466800	All right.
6466800	6467800	In other rap.
6467800	6468800	Maybe a little more Al Jazeera.
6468800	6469800	Fine.
6469800	6470800	All right.
6471400	6474480	Hey, there's a lot of great stuff that Teen Vogue's done in the past few years.
6474480	6475480	All right.
6475480	6476480	Oh no.
6476480	6477480	Teen Vogue is amazing.
6477480	6478760	Anyway, what else is amazing?
6478760	6482440	The Simpsons arcade game is a great game from years ago.
6482440	6485200	In fact, oh my God, is that it's 30 years old.
6485200	6488020	It sure is as a 30 year old game.
6488020	6490560	And we had all those rumors going into E3.
6490560	6491560	In fact, they weren't just rumors.
6491560	6496480	We had a fucking trailer that leaked and still yet no announcement at E3 about the Simpsons
6496480	6497480	arcade one up machine.
6497480	6499120	Well, guess what?
6500100	6502200	We will never know what caused the delay.
6502200	6503480	Nobody's saying anything.
6503480	6509400	All we know is that arcade one up officially announced the Simpsons arcade retro cabinet
6509400	6513620	and it's going to have authentic artwork and relatively easy assembly.
6513620	6517000	You can start preordering the machine on August 16th.
6517000	6521040	We don't know how much the machine is going to cost, but just so you know, Turtles in
6521040	6526140	Time is six hundred and fifty dollars and that is a pretty similar sort of thing.
6526140	6529540	And there's only going to be one game with this, with the Simpsons, because a lot of
6529540	6532100	those cabinets have multiple games in them.
6532100	6533100	Not this one.
6533100	6537780	So, but I will say if there's any cabinet that people remember from their childhood
6537780	6540340	that they might, it might be this one.
6540340	6544980	Anyway, I am crossing my fingers and toes that this means that Tron cabinet isn't far
6544980	6545980	behind.
6545980	6546980	But you know what?
6546980	6548380	I'm not going to hold my breath either.
6548380	6552740	Oh, Orange Wright says, I heard this also has Simpsons bowling.
6552740	6554380	It has a track ball.
6554380	6555380	Interesting.
6555620	6558260	But yeah, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what happened to the bowling game.
6558260	6560940	I didn't see the trackball on the new picture.
6560940	6561940	Hmm.
6561940	6566060	I wonder if something is there about why it got delayed.
6566060	6567060	I don't know.
6567060	6568060	I don't know.
6568060	6569060	Just maybe it's an add on you have to pay for.
6569060	6572260	Well, but then you have to pay for that trackball too, which would be weird to install.
6572260	6573260	That's what I'm talking about.
6573260	6576260	You have to pay for like a trackball edition or something.
6576260	6577260	Yeah.
6577260	6578260	Yeah.
6578260	6580720	So Bobby Blackwell is saying the rumor is the Simpsons bowling is the license that got
6580720	6582900	revoked and that was an eleventh hour revoked.
6582940	6587300	So that might, we might be starting to put together why did this suddenly not get announced
6587300	6588300	at E3?
6588300	6589300	Aha.
6589300	6590300	But we don't have it.
6590300	6591840	We don't have a definitive answer on that.
6591840	6595300	We just, we just sort of are reading tea leaves there.
6595300	6598540	Anyhow moving on Dark Sakura.
6598540	6601220	So finally updates for Animal Crossing.
6601220	6602860	So maybe I'll check on my village.
6602860	6608420	The updates, well, it says the update is supposed to happen July 29th.
6608420	6610700	So I missed that.
6610700	6613540	And that there were going to be more updates later in 2021.
6613540	6615300	So hopefully they'll be good.
6615300	6617540	I mean, it's the fireworks and the seasonal items.
6617540	6622500	So I don't know if it's going to be worth me playing again.
6622500	6630540	And then Hot Wheels Unleashed is going to have some pop culture cars in it.
6630540	6637500	So among those is going to be the Turtles party wagon from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
6637500	6642900	Apparently Snoopy, I guess on the, on the doghouse, you know, the Red Baron.
6642900	6643900	Yeah.
6643900	6644900	Yeah.
6644900	6645900	Yeah.
6645900	6646900	The Red Baron.
6646900	6647900	Yeah.
6647900	6648900	A kit from Knight Rider.
6648900	6649900	The DeLorean from Back to the Future.
6649900	6650900	The Batmobile.
6650900	6654700	I don't know which Batmobile, but there is something in there that honestly is more exciting
6654700	6656700	than all of that to me, Rob.
6656700	6657700	Hmm.
6657700	6658700	A Fiat 500.
6658700	6659700	Well, there you go.
6659700	6661580	Cause I drive one.
6661580	6668000	Every time I see a Hot Wheel Fiat, I buy it for myself the same way.
6668000	6671100	Every time I see any kind of Mustang, I buy it for Danny.
6671100	6673540	He's got so many Hot Wheel Mustangs.
6673540	6674540	It's not even funny.
6674540	6675540	Nice.
6675540	6676540	Yeah.
6676540	6677540	All right.
6677540	6681580	Now, if we could only get like the Hot Wheels pinball would be set.
6681580	6684980	Sia Tabiri bringing us what else is with that Animal Crossing update.
6684980	6690140	You can now get Boba tea and cotton candy in the drawings during fireworks events in
6690700	6691700	Animal Crossing New Horizons.
6691700	6692700	Well, that's cute.
6692700	6693700	Well, crap.
6693700	6694700	I better play.
6694700	6695700	All right.
6695700	6700700	Hey, there's, there's something to do instead of Fantation one night or whatever you were
6700700	6701700	thinking.
6701700	6702700	Animal Crossing journey.
6702700	6703700	All right.
6703700	6704700	Hmm.
6704700	6705700	Anyway.
6705700	6706700	That one's even harder to get my stuff set up for.
6706700	6707700	All right.
6707700	6708700	All right.
6708700	6711380	Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming
6711380	6713100	out soon near you.
6713100	6715140	Um, I, uh, Loki's not here tonight.
6715140	6717680	I will try to do the U S dates here.
6717680	6722960	So I'm on August 2nd age of empires three definitive edition is coming out for windows.
6722960	6726260	I kind of think that's probably the temple release this week because I don't see a lot
6726260	6730940	of big, big stuff this week, although for windows and stadia, we do have grime is coming
6730940	6731940	out on the second.
6731940	6737360	Uh, we also have in sound mind coming out for windows, switch, PS five, Xbox series
6737360	6738360	X.
6738360	6740560	That is a horror game, uh, from, we create stuff.
6740560	6745280	Uh, and then we have the falconeer warrior edition on switch PlayStation four and PlayStation
6745280	6746280	five.
6746280	6748500	That is a, um, air combat type of game.
6748500	6752000	So, uh, that, that's it for releases in the U S this week.
6752000	6756240	Um, let me, let me get in my plane and fly over to Japan real quick and get some of the
6756240	6757520	releases over there.
6757520	6761640	Um, on August 5th on the Nintendo switch, we have the legend of heroes trails of cold
6761640	6763020	steel too.
6763020	6766080	We also have that falconeer game is out on the switch this week.
6766080	6769280	Um, and that's it on the switch.
6769280	6772940	Let me check the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five PlayStation five is getting
6772940	6774960	the falconeer as well.
6774960	6775960	So that is out.
6775960	6778540	There's also a special guilty gears.
6778540	6782060	There's not a guilty your game, but like a fighting stick coming out if peripherals are
6782060	6783060	of interest to you.
6783060	6786780	Uh, and then the falconeer, that appears to be the big release in Japan because that is
6786780	6788660	also on the PlayStation four this week.
6788660	6793300	But you can also get dirt five, uh, in Japan getting its release, uh, for Japanese audiences
6793300	6795260	on the PlayStation four this week.
6795260	6797480	How about the UK dark Sakura?
6797480	6802300	Just a handful on, um, uh, third August we have spirit fair.
6802300	6807740	On the sixth that we have blue fire and Zenjin, I reckon that's how it's said.
6807740	6810260	And on the seventh we have seven days to die.
6810260	6811260	How appropriate.
6811260	6812260	All right.
6812260	6813260	That's it.
6813260	6814260	All right.
6814260	6817180	Kind of a slower week, but understandable.
6817180	6820000	We'll probably get a little more as we get into labor day and all that.
6820000	6824520	So let's get back into just a few stories here, uh, and then we'll get to a listener
6824520	6825520	round table.
6825520	6828740	I know I saw at least one email before the show tonight and then, um, we'll see, we'll
6828740	6829740	see if there's any calls.
6829740	6830740	Why not?
6831180	6833660	Um, or any questions you guys might have in chat.
6833660	6837240	And then of course, uh, I might pull a few stories from our discord, although I kind
6837240	6840240	of pulled some to fill out tonight's show role, but, uh, I do encourage you guys to
6840240	6844080	join our discord and, uh, continue the conversation throughout the week, especially now that they
6844080	6845640	have threads.
6845640	6849000	Like w you know, what's funny is that when we first made the switch to discord, I kind
6849000	6850000	of joked with Bobby.
6850000	6853840	I said, discord kind of replaced our forums on VOG network.
6853840	6856120	Cause you know, that got overrun with spammers.
6856120	6857840	We haven't used those forums in a long time.
6857940	6862540	They, they honestly just shouldn't even really be there except for the fact that, um, we
6862540	6865280	dark, we post our story stuff.
6865280	6866280	That's it.
6866280	6867280	OLR has a secret forum.
6867280	6868280	We're still using it.
6868280	6872620	Um, but yeah, and I think some of that actually powers, I just email you.
6872620	6873620	I know.
6873620	6874620	I know.
6874620	6875620	Um, yeah.
6875620	6876620	Yeah.
6876620	6877620	Yeah.
6877620	6878620	Yeah.
6878620	6880160	Although it probably would be better if you could get back on the forums.
6880160	6882020	It's all in one place, but it's all right.
6882020	6885420	Honestly, we should just kind of all move it, but we can talk about that later.
6885420	6888380	Cause I kind of think we should just have a special discord channel.
6888380	6889940	Let's move to slack.
6889940	6891380	Well, why not discord?
6891380	6892420	We already have one set up.
6892420	6893420	It's the same thing.
6893420	6894420	I guess.
6894420	6895420	All right.
6895420	6898460	Um, any Hey, uh, DJ Rama S says one note.
6898460	6899860	It's what we have at anime jam session.
6899860	6900860	Actually.
6900860	6901860	I love one note at work.
6901860	6904860	I never thought about using it for my personal stuff, but I use it at work all the time.
6904860	6905860	I'm on a Mac.
6905860	6907860	Mac has Microsoft stuff.
6907860	6908860	Yeah.
6908860	6911020	I don't want to have to pay for one note.
6911020	6912020	All right.
6912020	6913660	If it, if it's going to make me pay for it.
6913660	6914660	All right.
6914900	6921020	Uh, let's talk about, uh, this story and, uh, it is, this was getting a lot of traction
6921020	6927500	on social media this week and it has to do with, uh, a new series reported for Netflix,
6927500	6932340	a live action Pokemon series for Netflix.
6932340	6937440	This is not necessarily from the minds behind detective Pikachu, cause that's where a lot
6937440	6941220	of people's heads win at first, which I thought detective Pikachu was cute.
6941220	6945180	Like, and I was like, if there's a live action thing behind that, I kind of would be into
6945180	6946180	it.
6946180	6947180	I think.
6947180	6948500	However, this is coming from Lucifer's.
6948500	6952700	So the people behind Lucifer, Joe Henderson, we don't know a lot else.
6952700	6955260	Uh, this is a report that came from variety.
6955260	6959780	Variety is a, I guess the expose, but of Hollywood.
6959780	6964060	So they run a lot like variety and deadline are kind of the big names in Hollywood, uh,
6964060	6966340	that talk about what's going on in the industry.
6966340	6970760	There variety is reporting that the live action Pokemon series is in the works at Netflix
6970800	6975400	with Joe Henderson from Lucifer on deck as writer and executive producer.
6975400	6976400	That's it.
6976400	6977400	It's in its early days.
6977400	6978820	We don't know the plot.
6978820	6981040	Is it the, is it detective Pikachu?
6981040	6982680	Is it the anime series?
6982680	6983920	Is it a new story?
6983920	6984920	I don't know.
6984920	6986040	It's in its early stages.
6986040	6987040	Nobody knows.
6987040	6990720	A lot of people are jumping to conclusions, but we don't know.
6990720	6997720	Um, however, variety is saying that the Netflix show, according to sources, would be a live
6997720	7003800	action series akin to the detective Pikachu film with Ryan Reynolds and justice Smith.
7003800	7008560	But I don't see when I hear that, I don't hear it's in the same universe or it's the
7008560	7009560	same thing.
7009560	7011820	I hear this is not an anime.
7011820	7016120	This is not a cartoon because Netflix has been doing a lot of animes and cartoons.
7016120	7019980	So I think some people could have inferred that, Oh, they're just, you know, gonna make
7019980	7022620	their own movie or their own series or whatever.
7022620	7024680	And that's not actually what's happening here.
7024680	7026640	So all right.
7026640	7034100	Um, anyhow, um, we don't know a lot else, so we have not heard a single person cast.
7034100	7036160	We haven't seen a single frame of footage.
7036160	7040560	I kind of think I'm, you know what, why not?
7040560	7042680	Like how bad could it be?
7042680	7043800	Famous last words.
7043800	7045320	I'm willing to give it a try.
7045320	7046640	At least let's see a trailer.
7046640	7049560	I again, I liked detective Pikachu.
7049560	7053840	I think a lot of that rest on Ryan and Ryan Ryan Reynolds, but I like, I haven't seen
7053880	7058680	it and I want to, you should, I liked the way conceptually they put Pokemon in the real
7058680	7061940	world as if it was just a thing that was always around.
7061940	7063600	I thought it was really cute.
7063600	7064600	So we'll see.
7064600	7070320	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says the live action Pokemon series is a gateway to the smash brothers
7070320	7071320	movie universe.
7071320	7074160	Hey, Hey, I'll take it.
7074160	7076120	Um, SSJ 100.
7076120	7080520	Matt says with the success of detective Pikachu, I'm sure they fast tracked anything Pokemon
7080520	7081520	related.
7081520	7082520	Well, sure.
7082520	7085720	Things like Pokemon go, which I didn't get into that at the top of the show.
7085720	7088400	We're going to need some extra cause we need some extra stories.
7088400	7090440	We're going to have some extra stories in a little bit.
7090440	7095440	Um, we did have a hint of it and then a fifth dream in chat says it's a whole show with
7095440	7096440	only Bidoof.
7096440	7097440	Oh, my dream.
7097440	7098440	My dream.
7098440	7099440	The Bidoof show.
7099440	7100440	I will.
7100440	7104760	It's a, it's actually just a chat talk show with Bidoof, but, but, but, but you also need
7104760	7111240	like the, uh, like, you know how like at the end of He-Man they would have like the lesson.
7111240	7113280	You need that presented by a medkip.
7113280	7114280	I love it.
7114280	7115280	All right.
7115280	7120320	Uh, so anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hear more about that probably in a year.
7120320	7123920	If that, when somebody gets cast for this, I think once you start to hear what the cast
7123920	7126480	is, then you might know like what the story is.
7126480	7131200	So like if they cast an Ash Ketchum, then we know they're probably going around the
7131200	7134560	anime, but if they don't, then they're probably doing their own thing.
7134560	7136100	So we'll see.
7136100	7142220	If they do a Satoshi, then they're saying, we're going to do this the right way there,
7142220	7148680	but I have the, I have a feeling this is going to be very, uh, North America based, but maybe
7148680	7149680	I'm wrong.
7149680	7150680	Maybe I'm wrong.
7150680	7151980	That could be interesting too.
7151980	7153240	We'll see.
7153240	7154240	We don't know.
7154240	7155240	All right.
7155240	7158580	Um, how about, how about we do our extra stories now we're going to, we're going to break the
7158580	7163040	rules a little bit and insert two stories that are not in the sidebar.
7163040	7165740	So Dark Soccer, you just texted me something you wanted to talk about.
7165740	7166740	So why don't you go for it?
7166740	7167940	Cause I think it's funny.
7167940	7168940	I did.
7168940	7173260	I was poking at my Twitter for just a second and I saw that Ariana Grande was trending
7173260	7176300	and I'm like, what the hell is she done now?
7176300	7185620	Um, and it looks like that she is partnered with a Fortnite for a rift tour concert series.
7185620	7191980	Um, the series is scheduled for August six through eight with five show times over three
7191980	7193180	days.
7193180	7198820	So it's a musical experience they say with a special playlist and a playable character
7198820	7201060	that was inspired by Ariana.
7201060	7205500	Um, the character actually looks really cute and you're like wearing like this sort of
7205500	7209260	sparkly metallic holographic ish kind of thing.
7209260	7213340	And of course with her signature, like purple topknot, it is very purple.
7213340	7220660	Um, I'll just go ahead and read what exactly, um, this says, uh, Fortnite user, uh, apparently
7220660	7225620	they can schedule their showtime in Fortnite and then coordinate with their friends.
7225620	7233020	You go to rift tour.com for it and then, uh, she will be added to the games icon series
7233020	7237900	and then you get the items, uh, that are available from the item shop from her, including the
7237900	7244300	outfit and this like yellow piggy backpack called piggy smalls back bling and it's inspired
7244300	7248620	by her, her real life piglet pet for the record.
7248620	7251780	Don't forget a piglet as a pet, they will get big.
7251780	7263140	Um, and so, uh, this is a supposed to blow away Travis Scott's, uh, thing where they,
7263140	7268380	uh, basically broke the record for biggest live audience in Fortnite.
7268380	7274500	Um, so I don't know, it looks interesting that the trailer looks interesting.
7274500	7279780	Um, it's not enough to ever make me desire to want to play Fortnite, like in the least.
7279780	7283220	Not my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.
7283220	7285820	I said my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.
7285820	7293940	All right, well you do you, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing, but I'll be there.
7293940	7295940	Nothing but the best for our queen.
7295940	7298140	All right.
7298140	7303940	You know, she has one song that I like only because it kind of grew on me because they'd
7303940	7306700	play it at Badlands every fucking time I was there.
7306700	7310760	I like, okay, Into You is like a quintessential like gay song.
7310760	7311760	That's a gay anthem.
7311760	7312880	I love that song.
7312880	7318500	It was, uh, um, No Tears Left to Cry, but I also really liked the video for it.
7318500	7320420	I liked the cinematography in the video.
7320420	7321420	Yes, that was good too.
7321420	7325220	I really liked Thank U, Next that spoofed all the nineties films.
7325220	7326900	I thought it was so cute.
7326900	7330740	The video for that was great and I actually liked the message of the song, but I don't
7330740	7331740	like the song.
7331740	7332740	Fair.
7332940	7336620	And then there was a song in DDR that just recently got pulled because the license expired.
7336620	7340420	It was, um, it wasn't Into You, but it was something else from that album.
7340420	7341420	Help Me, Bamani fans.
7341420	7342540	What was the song of hers?
7342540	7345900	It was the sci-fi video where she was shooting the aliens and stuff.
7345900	7350820	I can't remember the name of the song, her brother's in it too, but, but, uh, I can't
7350820	7352540	remember the name of the song.
7352540	7353540	Bad Gay.
7353540	7354540	Help.
7354540	7355540	That's okay.
7355540	7357820	I don't know what song is at all.
7357820	7364140	Are there, are there any, see it to be somebody in chat who knows their music help.
7364140	7365140	They break free.
7365140	7366140	That's it.
7366140	7367140	That's it.
7367140	7368140	How can I forget that song?
7368140	7369140	It's such a good song too.
7369140	7372140	This is the part where I break free.
7372140	7373140	All right.
7373140	7375500	Anyway, that's, that's, that's it.
7375500	7376500	I'm never doing that again.
7376500	7380940	If you could see, if you see me looking at my, my cam right now, I'm looking at you,
7380940	7381940	Rob.
7381940	7384260	I see you through the internet and I'm judging you.
7384260	7385260	Stop it.
7385260	7386260	All right.
7386260	7387260	I feel awkward.
7387700	7389660	All right.
7389660	7390940	Now my story.
7390940	7392620	So let's talk about this.
7392620	7397720	So a lot of people dunking on Niantic today on Twitter, uh, because of Pokemon Go, which
7397720	7399720	is still going.
7399720	7404420	But as it is August 1st, you may or may not recall Niantic said they were going to be
7404420	7409240	reverting some changes that they had made due to COVID and all this, they were going
7409240	7412100	to be reverting some of that on August 1st.
7412100	7416060	And a lot of people are pissed off that they made good on that promise today.
7416060	7422300	And the big one is you can no longer spin pokey stops or gyms that are 80 meters away.
7422300	7428060	The radius is back down to what it used to be 40, which is very similar to what, um,
7428060	7431900	uh, the, the, uh, range is always been an ingress.
7431900	7432900	Sure.
7432900	7436940	Lower it when we have new variants, you know, out and people are stupid.
7436940	7437940	Exactly.
7437940	7439500	You saw the Lollapalooza thing, right?
7439500	7440500	Exactly.
7440500	7441500	Well, I'm sorry.
7441500	7442500	Massive spreader event.
7443100	7446140	Vaccinations were required to get into Lollapalooza too, though.
7446140	7451540	Um, people, but anyway, um, the, uh, Oh, what was I gonna say with all that?
7451540	7455740	The, um, interface game?
7455740	7456740	Yes.
7456740	7457740	Radius?
7457740	7458740	Yes.
7458740	7459740	The, the, Oh yeah.
7459740	7463620	So, um, a lot of that was in response to COVID and all that.
7463620	7465620	Um, but I, here's the problem.
7465620	7467820	Here's the problem.
7467820	7471020	I think that change was never really about COVID.
7471020	7472420	It really wasn't.
7472420	7477740	Um, I think they made certain concessions so that people would keep playing the game
7477740	7481860	and so that they wouldn't complete, like obviously the remote rating was put in and all of that
7481860	7482860	stuff.
7482860	7487980	But, um, 40 meters is still a pretty, I just, I'm going to preface this, I'm not defending
7487980	7495380	what Niantic did, but I think the error is not, it's, it's, it's how they did it.
7495380	7496720	So they doubled the distance.
7496720	7498540	They said, because of COVID we're doing this.
7498540	7503160	And then they said, this is a change that's probably, that's going to be permanent, basically.
7503160	7505480	They went back on that.
7505480	7507140	That's the first mistake they made.
7507140	7512620	The second mistake they made was when they went back on it, they put, they, they used
7512620	7515420	COVID as an excuse.
7515420	7518780	That I think is the biggest problem they made.
7518780	7523700	They're they didn't, they never scaled it up, in my opinion, due to COVID to begin with.
7523700	7529380	And for them to now say, well, because COVID is, you know, uh, you know, we, we, we have
7529380	7535280	a different standards now, rules now, whatever, uh, we're going to take this part away.
7535280	7541040	And I think they're using COVID as a crutch and an excuse for something that was generating
7541040	7542040	revenue.
7542040	7544620	And that was people buying Pokeballs and things like that.
7544620	7550620	So, uh, that's the tacky part to me is that they never should have scapegoated it as a
7550620	7552260	COVID thing to begin with.
7552260	7555300	And they certainly shouldn't be doing that now.
7555300	7557660	And it's pissing off a lot of fans.
7557660	7558660	It's just rude.
7558660	7561380	I just don't, I don't think fans are going to stop playing the game.
7561380	7562540	I really don't.
7562540	7567540	Um, I even saw the guy from Serebii and I'm not, you know, I'm just saying big names in
7567540	7574180	the Pokemon industry are, you know, in fandom are going out and saying this is fucked up.
7574180	7578180	So hopefully Niantic, it kind of pressures them into changing it back or what have you.
7578960	7583540	But it's only gonna happen if people stop spending money.
7583540	7584540	That's the only way.
7584540	7589820	I was considering playing it again and now I'm absolutely not going to.
7589820	7594260	So we'll, I mean, it's Sunday, so we'll see what happens come tomorrow after all this
7594260	7595980	negative press today.
7595980	7600520	But I also wrote a tweet that I'm surprised more people didn't see because I want to point
7600520	7602900	out something else.
7602940	7614060	I got an email today at 1 30 in the afternoon from Ingress, one of Niantic's other games.
7614060	7620660	And it says, August virtual first Saturday, August first Saturday at home, Saturday, August
7620660	7625700	7th, 2021 join our first Saturday, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7625700	7629820	Isn't that interesting that another Niantic game completely recognizes that things are
7629820	7635820	still virtual and things are still done this, you know, in a different way because COVID
7635820	7637820	is not a hundred percent gone.
7637820	7638820	Hmm.
7638820	7642860	Yeah, it's not going to be gone at all.
7642860	7648640	Yet Pokemon Go goes and says, oh, we're going to scale these things back or whatever.
7648640	7650420	You know that that's the problem.
7650420	7656620	Pokemon Go using COVID as a scapegoat to do this now is incorrect.
7657620	7661460	Mike Deft in chat says, pissing off is pretty tame.
7661460	7664280	Mike Deft says the whole player base is all sorts of mad.
7664280	7667260	Even influencers who work with Niantic are getting ignored.
7667260	7668260	Hmm.
7668260	7672620	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, there is apparently something that data miners found saying there
7672620	7677220	will be a way to power up Pokestops, which people are theorizing that means when you
7677220	7680620	power up a stop, you get more items and wider range.
7680620	7681620	Wow.
7681620	7683380	Sounds like a moneymaker to me.
7683380	7687340	Sounds like when they increased this range and said, it'll be permanent.
7687340	7691360	Somebody said, why didn't we charge for that?
7691360	7700140	It just comes off as really tacky on the heels of that report from days ago that talked about
7700140	7705140	how Niantic made a ton of money off Pokemon Go Fest.
7705140	7706140	Yike.
7706140	7707140	Hmm.
7707140	7712400	DJ Rama S says, maybe Pokemon Go is on a different team from Ingress and both teams aren't talking
7712440	7714360	to each other about COVID issues and support.
7714360	7716920	Oh, probably, but it's still not a good look.
7716920	7718320	Remember, remember we got one of those.
7718320	7720600	I need a card for this too.
7720600	7723860	Remember, it's not about the news.
7723860	7726320	It's not about the truth behind.
7726320	7730360	It's about what is perceived by the folks.
7730360	7735600	Or to quote Eddie Izzard, it's like 75% of it is how you sound.
7735600	7740760	10% of it is what you say and 5% is what you mean, I think.
7740760	7741760	Yes.
7742120	7743120	Exactly.
7743120	7746760	All right, let's move on back to the stories.
7746760	7750480	We had show rolled, but I both those things were big things we needed to get out.
7750480	7752200	I think they're even bigger in the last minute stories.
7752200	7753200	So.
7753200	7754200	All right.
7754200	7755200	I have no tears left to cry.
7755200	7756200	Thank you.
7756200	7757200	Why don't we break?
7757200	7758200	We vibing.
7758200	7761760	Let's break free from this segment and go to our next story.
7761760	7771920	So there is now I'm going into some kind of like obscure kind of local news for where
7771920	7774000	is this Wilmington?
7774000	7778080	I don't know what Wilmington it is, but it's a Wilmington.
7778080	7781240	But I wanted to bring it up because I think it's a really cool thing and I think we need
7781240	7783160	more of this happening.
7783160	7788720	So there is a video game lounge in Wilmington called Retroscape.
7788720	7792480	I'll have to look up more about that.
7792480	7798560	But basically what they are doing is that they have a video game summer day camp for
7798560	7802160	kids throughout all of July.
7802160	7808840	And their goal is to get these kids acquainted with the classics.
7808840	7811880	So sort of like video game history lab.
7811880	7820520	So they go in and they give them a presentation about the decade, you know, of gaming.
7820520	7825680	And so they did the 70s, 80s, 90s, and then they did the aughts and then go over the console
7825680	7830960	wars and then what was popular and then they do trivia and then they have the kids play
7830960	7832320	those games.
7832320	7835720	So it's pretty cool.
7835720	7842480	It's a way of bringing the younger generation in touch with the origins of what they enjoy
7842480	7845160	today.
7845160	7848240	Yeah.
7848240	7852920	And I still don't know what Wilmington this is.
7852920	7854400	Delaware?
7854400	7858320	Uh, uh, North Carolina.
7858320	7859880	Oh, okay.
7859880	7860880	Okay.
7860880	7861880	Yeah.
7861880	7864440	So there you go.
7864440	7865440	That's pretty cool.
7865440	7866440	Yeah.
7866440	7869440	I think more people would have been excited to go to summer camp if video games were involved.
7869440	7870440	Same.
7870440	7873320	I only had Bible camp.
7873320	7874320	Yeah.
7874320	7875320	Me too.
7875320	7876320	When I was younger.
7876320	7877320	Yeah.
7877320	7878320	Yeah.
7878320	7879320	Not quite the same.
7879320	7880640	Well, they would do, I think I want to say maybe we did play video games when they would
7880640	7882760	do like their lock-in stuff or whatever.
7882760	7885120	I want to say, because not us.
7885120	7886120	Yeah.
7886120	7887120	Which is interesting.
7887120	7888400	It was singing Jesus songs.
7888400	7893400	I want to say Atari 2600 games then were not very controversial.
7894360	7896680	All that stuff didn't come up till years later.
7896680	7897680	This was Alabama though.
7897680	7899040	We didn't have any of that.
7899040	7900040	They wouldn't pay for it.
7900040	7905680	They thought it was all the devil and we would make dioramas out of toilet paper rolls and
7905680	7910200	boxes and cotton, um, cotton balls.
7910200	7911200	Yay for cotton.
7911200	7912200	Jesus.
7912200	7916400	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says it's Wilmington, North Carolina and actually links to retro
7916400	7917400	Wilmington.com.
7917400	7918400	Cool.
7918400	7920660	But DJ Rama S brings up, I had computer camp.
7920660	7923360	It was kind of a, I do remember computer camp being a thing.
7923880	7924880	When I was younger.
7924880	7925880	We didn't have that either.
7925880	7929600	Yeah, I wasn't, I never really, maybe I did go, I did like a summer school thing that
7929600	7930600	involved computer.
7930600	7933880	That was probably the closest I got to it, but all right.
7933880	7934880	Anyway.
7934880	7935880	All right.
7935880	7936880	One more story before the round table.
7936880	7939360	And it is about, uh, I was a kid.
7939360	7944840	We had to go into the swamp and catch some mud, mud bugs and wrestle a gator.
7944840	7946280	We liked it.
7946280	7949000	This last story is about Dr. Mario.
7949000	7951400	Also a classic from the NES days.
7951440	7956200	And maybe you were playing the, uh, more modern Dr. Mario world game.
7956200	7958200	Uh, I played it for a hot minute.
7958200	7959200	Yeah.
7959200	7960200	Well guess what?
7960200	7961200	You're not gonna be playing it anymore.
7961200	7966920	Uh, at least as of October 31st, because Dr. Mario world's game servers will be going down.
7966920	7968720	Womp, womp.
7968720	7974480	Oh, so that is a, it, uh, apparently they're going to keep parts of the game on a site
7974480	7977000	called Dr. Mario world memories.
7977000	7980120	What the fuck consolation is that?
7980120	7981440	I just want Dr. Mario.
7981440	7983760	I mean, screw all that.
7983760	7989080	Uh, anyway, uh, it just goes to show a lot of Nintendo's mobile stuff has not been doing
7989080	7992280	as well as they thought because that game was only two years old.
7992280	7995280	Um, so it isn't exactly an old game at this point.
7995280	7996640	So, uh, Oh wow.
7996640	7999160	Did your own mess as I play it for 10 minutes a day, give or take.
7999160	8000480	Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
8000480	8003200	I'm sure there's clones of plenty out there though.
8003200	8008840	So I guess you'll have to find a decent one of those or something or, uh, have the switch
8008840	8009840	version.
8009840	8010840	I don't know.
8010840	8011840	All right.
8011840	8015360	Anyway, let's get into the listener round table.
8015360	8020800	We're going to get your chats, your comments in chat, uh, and, uh, the mailbag at participate
8020800	8022520	at orange launch radio.com.
8022520	8025720	If you want to call into the show, we can probably take one or two of those as well.
8025720	8030480	Just head over to our green room in discord, vog network.com slash discord.
8030480	8035880	Um, excuse me, but for now, let's go to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com
8035880	8037400	dark soccer.
8037400	8042900	We have one and it's long, but it's um, Hey, Hey, OLR right around the last team sale.
8042900	8045940	My husband decided to buy an Oculus quest too.
8045940	8049860	When I heard that he got it, I immediately went on steam and bought Moss beat saber, super
8049860	8054600	hot VR and Skyrim VR of those beat saber is the only one I'm interested in.
8054600	8057080	I love watching people play beat saber.
8057080	8058820	Now let me first give you some background.
8058820	8059820	Like Bobby black Wolf.
8059820	8061200	I have a lazy eye.
8061200	8065880	I had surgery to correct it when I was very young, so you don't see my left eye go out.
8065880	8070040	However, the surgery caused me to slightly see double for most of my life.
8070040	8073400	My glasses actually have prisons in there to help correct my vision growing up.
8073400	8078320	I never had any issues with seeing 3d or so I thought it wasn't until about four years
8078320	8083000	ago after I did vision therapy, I found out that I was missing a huge part of what 3d
8083000	8084000	is.
8084000	8088040	Before the therapy, I always thought that 3d was just things coming at you.
8088040	8092320	I never knew you could also see objects going in like a hallway or a room.
8092320	8094760	So this therapy opened up a whole new world for me.
8094760	8101440	Anyway, I played VR games at magfest, but those games weren't that visually intensive.
8101440	8104640	There is something about the Ikyulys quest two that makes it feel different.
8104640	8108480	Maybe it's the no wires thing, the better resolution, or maybe I wasn't playing the
8108480	8110800	right game when I was at magfest.
8110800	8114080	I was so intimidated when I first put on the quest two headset.
8114080	8119800	I mean, before you even get into a game, you're on this white room that seems to go on forever.
8119800	8124120	After having the vision therapy, seeing something like this is very intense for me.
8124120	8128880	It still is for me at times, I have to take a deep breath to calm down and that is when
8128880	8131160	I'm not even in a game yet.
8131160	8133920	So getting to the games, I have only played a couple so far.
8133920	8137860	Moss is so fascinating to me, especially when I can see down the hallways and objects moving
8137860	8139420	in the background.
8139420	8143260	When the mouse quill looks up at you, it's just the cutest thing.
8143260	8147600	Before I even start a page, I find myself just looking around for a couple of minutes
8147600	8149280	just to take all of it in.
8149280	8151000	I cannot wait for the sequel.
8151000	8153120	I also have been playing a lot of Beat Saber.
8153120	8157160	I love how I can be very active and have a lot of fun at the same time.
8157160	8161340	I really haven't gotten into superhot VR or Skyrim VR yet.
8161340	8164240	You're probably thinking I probably should have emailed this to Bobby since he covers
8164240	8166080	a lot of VR stuff.
8166080	8171720	Let me get to one of the reasons why I decided to email this to OLR.
8171720	8176600	Just the other day, my husband just bought a game called Synth Riders on the iCula store.
8176600	8179840	This is a rhythm game very similar to Beat Saber.
8179840	8183160	If you've never heard of this game, I really think all of you would love it.
8183160	8187340	So slashing with sabers, you punch these colored spheres.
8187340	8193060	There are also these holds that are very similar to the hold lines in DDR.
8193060	8198580	When you hold down with one foot while you use your other foot to hit the arrows.
8198580	8201720	In Synth Riders, you hold your arm.
8201720	8202720	I lost my place.
8202720	8206260	You hold up your arm and follow this curvy line with one hand and you use your other
8206260	8209600	hand to follow another line or hit the spheres.
8209600	8214520	You do this while you are listening to a mostly 80s-style synthwave music in a Tron-looking
8214520	8215520	world.
8215520	8219800	At one point, I thought I was in a slow-space mountain ride.
8219800	8221620	This game is wild.
8221620	8223680	You thought that Beat Saber was a workout.
8223680	8226080	Synth Riders is on a whole other level.
8226080	8227740	My body hurts after I am done.
8227740	8231480	The music is so good that it makes me literally dance.
8231480	8235300	The best part of this game is that custom songs are standard.
8235300	8236840	You don't have to mod the game at all.
8236840	8240760	You just drop in some files in your headset and the song appears in the song list.
8240760	8245660	I highly recommend this game if you love rhythm games and want to become more physically active.
8245660	8250420	Synth Riders is also available on Steam and is coming to PSVR August 10th.
8250420	8253680	Since you have had less emails lately, I am hoping to write it more.
8253680	8259600	I am planning on my next email to be about an old PC game that was based on a popular
8259600	8260800	candy.
8260800	8263920	I don't believe this game was ever talked about on OLR.
8263920	8264920	Please look forward to it.
8264920	8265760	Thanks, Ziba.
8267600	8268600	I love it.
8268600	8269600	Thanks for the email, Ziba.
8269600	8270720	And thanks for the game recommendation.
8270720	8274860	I thought I might have played this game once, but no, I'm confusing it with something else.
8274860	8276360	So I'm going to have to look into this.
8276360	8279460	I'm not going to do VR, so have fun.
8279460	8282680	I haven't played VR in a while.
8282680	8284680	The bummer is I don't have PC VR.
8284680	8285680	I have PlayStation.
8285680	8291220	So if it's not on PlayStation, I probably won't get around to it unless I do get to
8291220	8295140	spend a day with Bobby Black Wolf outside of Dragon Con when I go on my trip.
8295140	8299580	So maybe he'll fire up the PC at Black Wolf Manor and I can check this game out.
8299580	8302580	So I'll have to file that away in my brain to do that.
8302580	8303580	Check that out.
8303580	8306900	So because, you know, I'm going to want to play that Mandalorian pinball table, but I
8306900	8310440	could come over to Jamie's house and play it there, get it out of my system.
8310440	8314500	So we'll play it, play over here and then play Bobby's because we have two different
8314500	8315500	versions.
8315500	8316500	Ooh.
8316500	8317500	And that would be fun to say I've played both.
8317500	8323960	Well, I mean, I played multiple of I mean, well, and I think next year they're going
8323960	8326760	to go back to doing Golden State pinball expo.
8326760	8327760	Oh, uh huh.
8327760	8328760	I hope so.
8328760	8332760	But yeah, you're welcome to come over.
8332760	8334080	We need to we need to hang.
8334080	8335080	Yeah, it'll be fun.
8335080	8336080	It'll be good.
8336080	8337080	All right.
8337080	8338080	Thank you for the email, Ziba.
8338080	8339080	Appreciate it.
8339080	8343620	I was glad to hear about the experience, too, as even though you kind of joke that maybe
8343620	8346920	you should have sent it to Bobby because your experience was similar to him.
8346920	8348740	We welcome those emails as well, of course.
8348740	8353580	And yeah, I was definitely I'm always interested to hear.
8353580	8356900	These gaming stories from other people's perspectives, because it's like the trypophobia
8356900	8357940	stuff we talked about this week.
8357940	8361740	I would have never known, you know, unless something kind of came up about it and somebody
8361740	8362740	brought it to my attention.
8362740	8363740	You know what I mean?
8363740	8365180	So I think it's neat.
8365180	8366180	All right.
8366180	8367820	We're going to take a call.
8367820	8370900	And so I have to do a little magic behind the scenes to make this work.
8370900	8374540	And let's go to our green room and we're going to bring in the caller.
8374540	8376420	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
8376420	8377420	Who's this?
8377420	8380020	Oh, it's the one and only DJ Ron mess.
8380020	8381020	How is everybody doing?
8381580	8384460	It is so good to actually see you, Rama.
8384460	8386460	How are you doing, Rama?
8386460	8387460	I'm great.
8387460	8390620	I can tell that y'all got your gifts finally.
8390620	8391620	Yes.
8391620	8394540	I just saw Jamie held held hers up.
8394540	8396540	And I sent you a picture of Mr. Smoosh with the patch.
8396540	8397940	I don't have it here next to me.
8397940	8398940	But yeah.
8398940	8399940	Right.
8399940	8400940	And I have mine right here.
8400940	8403540	So not as Oh, you got more than one.
8403540	8407460	They sent me an extra one purely by accident.
8408020	8411140	When you pay for it, you're allowed to keep the extras, I think.
8411140	8412140	So it's awesome.
8412140	8413140	I love it.
8413140	8414140	Right.
8414140	8417340	Well, it's like I said, it's glow in the dark.
8417340	8419660	I got to try that part out, actually, to us.
8419660	8422020	So to what do we owe this fabulous phone call tonight?
8422020	8427580	Well, I want to talk about something real quick from last week's show up and something
8427580	8433340	that had mentioned and I agree with what she said, but at the same time, I'm kind of hesitant
8433340	8434340	about it.
8434340	8436820	It's about unionizing the whole gaming industry.
8437180	8438180	Okay.
8438180	8442820	I agree, you know, that the gaming industry should be unionized.
8442820	8449500	But my issue is that some unions can be so powerful that it can screw over, you know,
8449500	8455580	the everyday person, you know, and sometimes that union can also screw over to people that
8455580	8459940	put money into it because I used to be a union guy working in a supermarket.
8459940	8464340	And yes, the union will take care of you as any problems, any issues, take it to your
8464340	8465340	shop steward.
8465380	8468300	I was like that for the two weeks I worked at a grocery store.
8468300	8469300	Mm hmm.
8469300	8471620	So they will take care of you.
8471620	8477440	I remember something had happened and they investigated and they looked at me like, well,
8477440	8479020	we can't help you.
8479020	8480520	Here is your last day.
8480520	8481520	Here is your paycheck.
8481520	8485260	And I'm just like, this incident was not even my fault.
8485260	8487140	So how am I getting the blame?
8487140	8489740	Oh, because I was on shift when it happened.
8489740	8493400	So that's some bullshit.
8493400	8496960	You bring up a good point, though, is that we talk about, you know, union, it does have
8496960	8502280	to be the right union and it has to be done in a way where it's for the employees.
8502280	8507240	That's also kind of why I and again, I do support the unionization of the industry,
8507240	8509960	but I'm also at the mindset where I'm like, it's not going to happen overnight.
8509960	8511040	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
8511040	8513520	That is going to be a years long process.
8513520	8517400	And also unions need to be smaller, I think.
8517400	8518400	Right.
8518400	8523520	And that's kind of why I'm like, we at least need these types of like legal defense funds
8523520	8530080	or things that at least bring the people together as a bridge to that as the first step to kind
8530080	8535160	of getting there, I think is is my my a little bit more, I think, I think realistic.
8535160	8538560	I see realistic approach, but I kind of think that's where that's where it's coming from
8538560	8539560	for me.
8539560	8541000	No, I totally get that.
8541000	8545500	And I remember, you know, like if I'm not mistaken in the United States, there's less
8545500	8550500	than 10 Starbucks locations that are unionized and like three or four of them are in New
8550500	8553860	York City.
8553860	8560780	And like one of the big unions out here is a TWU 100 that handles the bus drivers and
8560780	8561780	subway.
8561780	8566060	And when they went on strike, basically that brought New York City to its knees because
8566060	8567780	how are you going to get somewhere?
8567780	8568780	You know.
8568780	8569780	Mm hmm.
8569780	8572940	And that's also the power of that union.
8572940	8573940	That's true.
8573940	8574940	Right.
8574940	8576420	They had a New York cripple for about a week.
8576420	8578820	They went back to the table.
8578820	8584220	Contracts were hammered out by I do what you have to do that everybody else in the union
8584220	8590180	gets their fair share, but at the same time, try not to, you know, put the screws to somebody,
8590180	8592460	you know.
8592460	8598180	Who is I even remotely related to it, and I can say this much if a gaming company is
8598180	8603020	under a union and let's say, you know, they're at the table negotiating and there's issues
8603020	8604540	with the contract.
8604540	8606180	This company goes on strike.
8606180	8611560	The most that will happen is a bunch of games will not be released for a lot of us.
8611560	8616460	It's not a big deal because we have backlogs of we're used to it.
8616460	8617460	Yeah.
8617460	8618460	Basically.
8618460	8621820	And for some, you got some who will be screaming and crying because they've been waiting for
8621820	8623140	this game for so long.
8623140	8624140	They want it now.
8624140	8629140	And I'm like, look, I can wait another three weeks.
8629140	8630140	Exactly.
8630140	8631140	Exactly.
8631140	8639420	Like, like when Cyberpunk got delayed, I'm like, well, I got more time to be delayed
8639420	8640420	longer.
8640420	8641420	Yeah.
8641420	8644340	I'm waiting for that game to drop to 19 before I pick it up.
8644340	8649180	So it just it does surprise me, especially when we're constantly making comparisons of
8649180	8653440	the gaming industry to Hollywood and that, you know, that other artistic industry.
8653440	8658320	And you look at Hollywood, there's unions up the wazoo that can bring that industry
8658320	8659320	to its knees.
8659320	8660320	Hello.
8660320	8664520	Do you remember the Writers Guild strike that pretty much killed the TV show Heroes?
8664520	8666380	That was pretty good.
8666380	8670160	And then the Writers Guild strike kind of, you know, that all happened.
8670160	8671160	And but I understand.
8671160	8674800	I'm not saying I'm just saying that people remember it because of those types of things
8674800	8675800	that happen.
8675800	8678960	SAG-AFTRA, of course, is a huge one.
8678960	8683500	Directors Guild, you know, you name it like there's unions for it in the Hollywood space.
8683500	8688280	So it is weird to me that in the gaming space, which is quite frankly, a very similar industry,
8688280	8690280	we don't have shit.
8690280	8691280	Yeah.
8691280	8696320	And like, I know I have friends that are in SAG-AFTRA and it's interesting, like, if they're
8696320	8697320	since they're voice actors.
8697320	8699320	We have some mutual friends.
8699320	8700480	Yep, definitely.
8700480	8706320	Some of them have to go under alternate names to do non-union stuff, you know, so it's kind
8706320	8707320	of crazy.
8707320	8710320	So, yeah.
8710320	8713780	Another comment here from Mr. Chio 100 Matt, I think some industries need more representation
8713780	8716680	from, say, a union rep than other industries.
8716680	8718280	Gaming has gotten to the point where it needs it.
8718280	8722120	Folks are being taken advantage of hours and night, rights wise, excuse me.
8722120	8724720	If it means that some games take longer to make, then I'm all for it.
8724720	8728060	At least the folks behind the game aren't sleeping under their desk working 60 hours
8728060	8729060	a week.
8729060	8730060	Preach.
8730060	8732800	And I agree, nobody should be working that long.
8732800	8733800	I mean, hell.
8733800	8734800	It's unhealthy.
8734800	8737560	I work in IT.
8737560	8740400	You would think that it's normal nine to five.
8740400	8745760	Sometimes we are there till late, you know, and thankfully most places I've worked at
8745760	8750480	managers have come like, well, here's a voucher for food or here's this, here's that.
8750480	8754720	And I know people who have worked longer hours than I have who do on-sites and they don't
8754720	8757480	even get that type of stuff, you know?
8757480	8765160	And thankfully with the IT I do, I'm glad that I'm doing what I do and not what you
8765160	8769400	do, even though people.
8769400	8772520	The funny thing is I love what I do.
8772520	8773520	Yeah.
8773520	8774520	And I love what I do.
8774520	8775760	I'm like, I'm used to it.
8775760	8785200	I'm like, I've had VIPs, VPs, SVPs, yelling at me over something that's not my fault.
8785200	8786200	Fix it.
8786200	8791400	Next thing you know, my manager's thanking me on, a long letter like this, thanking me
8791400	8792400	for the work that I did.
8792400	8794760	I'm just like, just doing my job.
8794760	8797520	I like what Finara says, IT industry.
8797520	8798560	You don't see the sun.
8798560	8801720	You go in when it's dark and you get out when it's dark.
8801720	8803640	That sounds like one of my jobs.
8803640	8808200	Once we worked and we had the window covered up and a sign on the door that says, you must
8808200	8811040	call the help desk if you need anything.
8811040	8813160	About once in, we were told to take the sign down.
8813160	8818080	Well, at least we could see the light of the outside windows, you know?
8818080	8819080	Yeah.
8819080	8821880	Well, and then when you do what I do, it's like, I don't need to call the help desk.
8821880	8823520	I do this for a living.
8823520	8826000	And then you have to call the help desk.
8826000	8828760	I have been there working at another company.
8828760	8830760	Well, we can't fix it here.
8830800	8835600	We have to call retail IT to have them remote in, reboot it, and then we take it from there.
8835600	8840800	It's just funny when you work, and I can't say where I work, I would get in a lot of
8840800	8847320	trouble, but like when you have your own IT group for what you do, and then you also have
8847320	8848840	to work with engineers.
8848840	8850920	I completely understand.
8850920	8856200	Since I no longer work for a company, I worked for about a year at Microsoft, so I completely
8856200	8857200	understand.
8858160	8859160	All right.
8859160	8865760	Well, now this is turning into IT venting session, which is okay, but yeah.
8865760	8868760	I'm sure both of us have stories.
8868760	8869760	Right?
8869760	8870760	Yeah.
8870760	8873760	Don't make me get the pitos.
8873760	8879480	Rama, before I wrap up, do you want to give us a cheap plug for Anime Jam Session, please
8879480	8880480	do?
8880480	8881480	Sure, definitely.
8881480	8885600	Check us out at Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays at 9.30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Tuesday
8885600	8890120	nights, and this week we'll be talking about what happened at Eddie Magic.
8890120	8892800	The lines were up to two to three hours to get in.
8892800	8897020	People were painting due to heat stroke.
8897020	8898440	People were bringing water.
8898440	8902960	They had a special section for people who are waiting for the EMT.
8902960	8910200	It looked like, imagine walking in the AX three years ago with what's going on right
8910200	8911200	now.
8911200	8913080	That's how it looked inside.
8913080	8914080	Oh.
8914960	8918120	Did I ever tell you about Sacramento Pride 2019?
8918120	8919120	No.
8919120	8927960	They were overcrowded, actually a lot of the EMTs were being pulled away, and people were
8927960	8931160	having heat stroke left and right, but people were trying to stay to see Lizzo.
8931160	8933200	I was like, that was the Lizzo concert, wasn't it?
8933200	8934200	That was a Lizzo concert.
8934200	8938360	That was way too big of a name for that venue.
8938360	8944760	But yeah, you've got to have, you have to anticipate the worst case scenario, especially
8944760	8945760	at an anime con.
8945760	8946760	I mean, please.
8946760	8947760	Yeah.
8947760	8952200	I think this is like their first year, so of course mistakes will happen, but this is
8952200	8953200	like-
8953200	8955600	This is mistakes that could really hurt people.
8955600	8956600	Exactly.
8956600	8957600	Exactly.
8957600	8958600	All right.
8958600	8960560	Well, tune in on Tuesday night for more.
8960560	8965760	Rama, so happy to have you here as one of our first callers here in this revitalized
8965760	8967440	call-in segment here on OLR.
8967520	8968520	I like your shirt.
8968520	8969920	Big hearts for you as well.
8969920	8970920	All right.
8970920	8971920	Here's mine.
8971920	8975240	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
8975240	8976240	Love it.
8976240	8977240	All right, my friend.
8977240	8978240	We'll see you next time.
8978240	8979240	All right.
8979240	8980240	Thanks for being here.
8980240	8981240	Take care, buddy.
8981240	8982240	Stay fabulous.
8982240	8983240	You too.
8983240	8984240	All right.
8984240	8985240	Bye.
8985240	8986240	All right.
8986240	8992120	You know what that made me remember is Slidekick's old podcast, Fabulous Flames.
8992120	8993680	Oh, my husband was on that podcast.
8993680	8994680	Fabulous Flames.
8994680	8995680	That's right.
8995680	8996680	Oh, that's right.
8996920	8997920	It was the best.
8997920	8999560	It was the best name.
8999560	9000560	It really was.
9000560	9005360	And anytime someone thinks it says fabulous, I think of that podcast to this day.
9005360	9007600	It's really a shame it's not still around.
9007600	9009840	I mean, none of those people play wow anymore.
9009840	9011700	And I'll just I'll spill tea.
9011700	9013720	Their third host was such a negative Nancy.
9013720	9014720	I couldn't stand it.
9014720	9020120	Like, don't do a show about a game if you're just going to shit on the game.
9020120	9022960	But do not piss in my cornflakes.
9022960	9023960	Piss in somebody else's.
9024240	9028520	I loved hearing Alan and Slidekick talk about wow and all that.
9028520	9030160	It's gone too soon.
9030160	9031160	Pour one out.
9031160	9033360	I see Alan's in the kitchen, but he has his earbuds in.
9033360	9034520	So he's listening to something else.
9034520	9035520	It's not this program.
9035520	9036520	Hi, Alan.
9036520	9038240	Oh, he heard that one.
9038240	9039240	Hi.
9039240	9040240	We're just talking about you.
9040240	9042640	Alan, do you remember Fabulous Flames?
9042640	9046280	Yeah, he just made this face.
9046280	9047280	He made this face.
9047280	9048280	So I'm going to try to read.
9048280	9049280	Sorry, podcast.
9049280	9050280	I'm going to do this back of the camera.
9050280	9052280	He made this face like this.
9052280	9053280	Yes.
9053600	9054600	Alright.
9054600	9060280	Anyway, um, let's see.
9060280	9063960	I think we might have touched on our last minute stories already, but I will ask Dark
9063960	9068320	Soccer if there's anything else she wants to bring up here for last minute stories.
9068320	9075120	Um, well, it's not really like a big news thing, but it's something I do want to warn
9075120	9077960	my fellow DVD players.
9077960	9080320	The disconnect penalty is back.
9080360	9083520	I noticed that on some streams I was watching.
9083520	9085360	Yes, yes, for sure.
9085360	9086360	All right.
9086360	9087360	Um, okay.
9087360	9088880	Uh, that's it.
9088880	9091800	We're going to wrap up, get some final thoughts, but first I'm going to tell you, thank you
9091800	9095760	so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio or Listening Live and, uh, tuning into the
9095760	9097200	show and supporting us.
9097200	9100900	If you liked what you heard here on the show, please tell a friend or two, help us spread
9100900	9103440	the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9103440	9105520	But if the gamers aren't here, we can't share their voices.
9105520	9108920	Like we just had Rama on a minute ago to share his voice and we hope to get more of you in
9108920	9109920	the coming weeks.
9110200	9113280	So thank you so much to those of you that were here in chat tonight and of course everybody
9113280	9118120	who downloads the show throughout the week on iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever
9118120	9121720	it is you listen to podcasts on, thank you so much for, uh, putting Orange Launch Radio
9121720	9124040	in your rotation and being a part of the show.
9124040	9131560	Uh, if you feel so inclined, you can always, uh, shop our merch store, uh, over at vognetwork.com
9131560	9138500	slash uh, shop if you'd like to do that and, um, I think that's, that's all I have to say
9138540	9139540	for my cheap plugs.
9139540	9143060	So, uh, thank you, SJ100Matt for sending that, uh, link out there.
9143060	9144060	So thank you again.
9144060	9145060	Uh, final thoughts.
9145060	9147180	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.
9147180	9151060	I want people to stay with me tonight while I play because it gets really lonely playing
9151060	9152060	by myself.
9152060	9153060	Pretty please?
9153060	9154060	All right.
9154060	9158820	I got to edit the show or it won't get done sadly.
9158820	9160900	I try to try to kind of have it running on my phone though.
9160900	9161900	Well that, that's fine.
9161900	9162900	Rob, you get a pass.
9162900	9163900	Okay.
9163900	9164900	Yeah.
9164900	9167660	But, um, but, uh, I am going to go ahead and turn off my camera cause I have to set up
9167700	9168700	the OBS cameras.
9168700	9170220	So no worries.
9170220	9171220	So take care.
9171220	9172220	We'll see you next time.
9172220	9173220	Dark Soccer.
9173220	9180000	And then my final thought for tonight is, um, I don't know, I'm, I'm, I hope this thing
9180000	9183240	heals up cause there's an ingress thing I want to go to Wednesday and I'd like to actually
9183240	9184980	be able to socialize with people.
9184980	9189940	Um, except if I still have all these bandages on my neck, I don't know how, uh, easily possible
9189940	9190940	that's going to be.
9190940	9193620	Uh, so we'll just take it as it comes.
9193620	9198020	Anyway, uh, thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9198020	9200060	Uh, I hope you all have a wonderful week.
