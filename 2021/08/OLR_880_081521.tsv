0	29000	Even before games started regularly featuring a photo mode to hide the HUD and all in-game chrome, there have been games where photography is the main point. Fatal Frame, Pokemon Snap, Classic and New, and my new favorite upcoming indie game, Paparazzi. This game looks adorable, and optimistically, it looks like it's going to have plenty of content, compositional capability, and adorableness, and really, what more do you need?
30000	37000	This is one of many games being named. It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about them and why they're relevant. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
41000	58000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back once again tonight with episode number 880 of our show for this August the 15th of 2021.
58000	70000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am not joined tonight, unfortunately, by DarkSakra or Jamie Summers. She's feeling a little bit under the weather, hoping it's not the big C, but she got her brain scraped today to see if it's going to be that.
71000	86000	Hopefully, it's not that though, and it's something minor, but we will hear from her in a pre-recorded segment later in the show, but she will not be joining us live throughout the show, unfortunately, but hopefully she's able to rest her voice and feel a lot better for next week.
86000	89000	But I am joined, of course, tonight by Techmaster Loki.
90000	91000	Hello.
92000	93000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
94000	95000	I'm doing fine.
96000	97000	Awesome. What's new? What's up?
98000	99000	Not a whole lot.
100000	114000	Where do we start with our talk tonight? I feel I've had the most boring weekend, quite honestly. Well, I mean, for the purposes of this podcast, I played video games like literally all weekend outside of a Target run that was the highlight of my weekend.
115000	123000	But yeah, I thought about playing video games. I keep looking at my stack of NES games I have over here and I was like, ooh, I should really play those.
124000	131000	Actually, that wasn't the thought I had in my mind. My thought I had in my mind is, ooh, I should buy some more that I'm never going to play.
131000	141000	Yeah, that's what I should do because I was like, there's no Contra over there. I need Contra, but I didn't buy it because I think the last time I went to go buy games like Contra was pretty expensive.
142000	143000	Yeah.
144000	145000	And I didn't want to pay a ton of money for Contra.
145000	159000	Yeah, I hear you. Depending on where you go, I find that the retro video game stuff can really vary. Like, you know, some of these stores, while they're fun to go to and look around and shop, they really do charge, you know, a premium for the retro stuff.
160000	170000	I don't know if that's just because of the age or because, you know, that stuff is, there's a lot of people kind of like you, I think, that like remember it from when they were a kid and they want to get the cartridge to let their kids play.
171000	174000	Like every time I go to a retro store, I see some family in there doing that exact thing.
175000	186000	They were pretty reasonable at like the place we have near us called Fair Game. But then there's also, there's one that's out there in that tiny, the tiny flea market kind of near you.
187000	188000	Oh, yeah.
189000	202000	But their game store sucks because it's dirty and all of the games are unorganized, completely unorganized. Like, I'm looking for something, I have no idea where I'm going to find it in all of this garbage.
202000	214000	And all of the games are like, a lot of them have like stickers torn off of them and stuff. It just is not in good condition. Whereas Fair Game, they may charge a little bit more, but like, you'd know what you're getting.
215000	223000	And it's alphabetical. It's easy to find what you're looking for. Plus, they have like box copies and like homebrew games and stuff like that.
223000	233000	So it, some of that's pretty cool. But yeah, I do want, I wanted to get Contra, but you know, I haven't played any of that. But I was looking at like the Guardian Legends staring at me.
234000	243000	Oh, I love that. When you were talking about the unorganized store, it really took me back to my first minimum wage job out of high school. I worked at a video store here locally.
243000	255000	You would remember Plaster TV, but I bet a lot of people, you know, don't remember that chain. So I worked at their flagship store in Roseville, which was the huge one that I think it used to be an appliance store at some point. It was huge.
256000	267000	And they had every, I can talk all the shit I want because the chain went under a long time ago. It was a fine job. I certainly had no problem with it or the people, but it always kind of blew my mind that like they were completely disorganized.
267000	280000	Like they would just have the A movies are here, the B movies are here, and then they had new releases in one corner. And it was like just kind of a mess of just, these are all the stuff that had come out like in the last 12 months over here in this area.
281000	289000	And people would come in and ask where such and such. And it's like, it's over there somewhere. Go, go find the box and bring it to me, then I can go back and look at the tape.
289000	302000	And we used to kind of go back and, oh, there's two out there on the floor somewhere. So, you know, sometimes if it wasn't, it wasn't Friday or Saturday night, we go help the customer find the box. But it was just, I, no wonder they're out of business, Loki.
303000	318000	That's my point. Like it was so unorganized. No wonder they're out of business. I really think, you know, Blockbuster and Hollywood had it down a little smarter where you didn't, you didn't go to the back and find the bot, like the boxes were either out there where the movie was or it wasn't there.
319000	321000	You know what I mean? This is silly.
322000	333000	Going to our chat, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Voice of Geeks Network. And we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
334000	345000	And by the way, catch Bobby Black Wolf this weekend in Atlanta at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo if you happen to be local. And, you know, you're OK with conventions because I know it's a weird year and certainly they have safety precautions in place and all that good stuff.
345000	354000	But we're pushing the conventions a little lighter this year. This year it's kind of like if you happen to be in the area, you know, stop on by. But we get it if you don't.
355000	361000	But if you are in the Atlanta area this this coming weekend, say hi to Bobby Black Wolf. He'll be at Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
362000	375000	So, yeah, we're on Sundays after him, six Pacific, nine Eastern. Of course, we tape live and we get comments from our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where Questbuster says goodwill is sometimes good for a lost treasure or two.
376000	388000	I've seen old PC games from the 80s in amazing as in lovingly used and taken care of packaging there. You know, I'm hearing that's a good place to find the plastic instruments like rock band, all that stuff.
388000	399000	Yeah, they're not usually good condition, but I know like I used to we used to take our kids to like their gymnastics class, which is right next to a goodwill.
400000	409000	And I used to go over there beforehand or during to go look around. But yeah, they usually did have a lot of Guitar Hero guitars. They had DJ Hero turntables and stuff like that.
409000	418000	Not for like Xbox. They're always like for the Wii and PlayStation two and stuff like that. But they had a ton of those.
419000	425000	Not in great condition all the time. They never really had retro games, though, because a lot of that stuff gets priced out.
426000	435000	You can actually go online and there's a site for goodwill auctions. You can actually search for stuff through there as well.
435000	442000	I got a whole collection of like Disney Infinity characters through that one time. Nice. But.
443000	451000	Yeah, it's kind of hard to find stuff nowadays, especially in Goodwill, because people know what that stuff's worth, and so they they charge quite a bit.
452000	456000	But sometimes you get lucky or like garage sales and stuff like that. People just want to get rid of it and they don't care.
456000	467000	It also, you know, it also probably depends where you're at when it comes to the Goodwill. Like, you know, we're in pretty much we're in proximity to Silicon Valley, you know, being in Northern California.
468000	477000	So I'm sure people here kind of know the value of that stuff. But I bet you in more rural parts of the country, you may have some hidden treasures at those types of stores. Could be interesting.
477000	487000	Yeah. Bobby Blackwell points out, especially now that people see Super Mario 64 going for millions of dollars, even though it's a very specific circumstance, but I digress.
488000	497000	As Bobby mentioned, his old Friday Night Gaming co-host moved to sack and open legacy toys and games. Yeah, I went and checked to see if they had any video games listed on their website.
497000	512000	The only one that they have listed is a sealed cut or it's a graded copy of Super Mario Brothers for $300,000. So that'll be a no for me. I'm not going to be driving down to Elk Grove to go check that out.
512000	513000	Fascinating.
514000	534000	Yeah, people. I don't get the whole like collect. I mean, I get collecting games. I don't get paying $300,000 for like a mint condition game like that. That seems like the only way you would want to do that is to hold on to it for in resale for more money. But like, is it really going to go higher than that?
535000	538000	I that's an insane risk.
539000	552000	There's that store downtown too. They're super cute. But I don't want I don't want to I don't want to get too hyper local here because we have a nationwide international audience really that listens to Orange Lounge Radio. So thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show. Appreciate that.
553000	566000	I do want to go to this comment before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is about Nintendo related stuff. I thought I would bring in this comment from Tiger Claw, who in chat said I saw Free Guy today. It's pretty good. I know Loki saw it also.
566000	575000	So this isn't really a movie about a video game directly, but it's definitely like video game culture. So how was it, Loki? You saw it, Loki?
576000	577000	I liked it. Yeah, it was really good.
578000	582000	You liked it? So it wasn't like pixels bad because I was a little worried. It was gonna be like Adam Sandler's pixels.
583000	594000	No, it wasn't bad. It wasn't bad at all. It was it was good. I mean, there's like some dumb stuff, some stuff you have to suspend, you know, disbelief for but like overall, it's good. I like Brian Reynolds. So like it was a good movie.
594000	595000	That's good.
596000	612000	They did have like some stuff in it that, you know, definite nods to certain video games and stuff. So they understand some of that. And there's some things that could have probably been done a little bit better, like some of the stuff is a little bit cringy. But overall, I mean, it was funny and entertaining. So I liked it.
613000	621000	All right. I guess I have to see it at some point. I'm just not really in a hurry to go run to the theater and pay the money to see it. But all right. Yeah. Yeah.
622000	627000	Detective Pikachu is super cute. Oh, is it a kid friendly movie? I kind of I kind of assume PG 13.
628000	633000	OK, it looks a little R rated to me from the trailer. I mean, not that I care. It's not like I mean, no titties.
634000	643000	No, no, it's like it's mainly just language. Like they have the one f bomb that they dropped. I'm like, there's the PG 13 f bomb right there.
644000	645000	They get one.
647000	659000	So and it can't it can't be about the act. That is also that you can say you can say, well, we can say on all our we can say fuck. But you you can only say it fuck once in a PG 13 movie.
659000	668000	But you can't say it about the act of fucking. No, no, no spoilers. It was him saying good morning to his fish. So like every like he kept feeling like better.
669000	676000	He's like, so good morning. I think his name, the fish's name was like Goldie or something like that. But he's like, good morning. He's like, have a great fucking day.
677000	684000	So it was pretty funny. But yeah, I can't believe you would spoil uses of the word fuck in movies. How dare you?
684000	697000	I told you so. But otherwise, it wasn't like violent. Like the the most violence that there was is when he shot like a guy like in the chest. And there's like, kind of just like a cartoon hole there, basically. And that was in the trailer.
698000	707000	And that's like, literally the most violent that it gets a little bit like, but there is just some funny characters and stuff that they had in it. And there's a lot.
707000	726000	Okay, so this is a small gripe that really bothered me. It just details because I noticed it. And so like this, like really could have been just something that they could have taken care of. So in the movie, there's lots of like YouTubers and Twitch streamers that have cameos in it, which is fine.
727000	754000	But like some of the events are they're talking about in in this like fictional world of Free City. So they're doing like these like almost like videos about Free City and what's going on at that time. If you look at the dates on each of the videos that they show, they're like months apart from each other. It's like this is all supposed to be taking place at the same time, but they didn't have the forethought to computer edit like the dates so that they're kind of similar in time.
754000	771000	Like, why would you do like this videos from July 2020? This one's from December 2020. It's like clearly this. There's two people talking about the same thing that's going on right now. And they're like months apart. Like, I know it's such a small gripe, but come on. That's, that's basic stuff.
771000	776000	Fifth Dream in chat says real streamers. Okay, definitely not watching it now.
801000	816000	Person, though, that's supposed to be like a big streamer. That's hilarious. I'm not going to spoil it. But like that, that person was a hilarious character in there. And I thought that was really well done. But yeah, it's interesting.
816000	833000	All right, now see, I'll see it for free when it's on one of the seven, you know, film apps out there, like the Netflix, the Hulu, the Paramount, whatever HBO Max, one of the 17 apps they have Disney plus Disney is a Disney god damn fox. That's the one I canceled.
833000	850000	Ah, all right. It's a fox movie. And it's funny that because there's a point in the movie where it's like, this is when Fox got purchased by Disney. Like, you can tell, like, this is the very moment that they got purchased by Disney. Because now, now they can do all these things. And it was hilarious.
850000	879000	How do you think Mickey Mouse felt about that good fucking morning to the fish? Hmm. Hmm. You think Mickey Mouse approves of that? Oh, no. Anyway, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic. I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo World, which is like the the indie kind of showcase that they did this week. So yeah, Indie World happened a few days ago, I think it was Wednesday, and they were talking about the latest and greatest Nintendo indie releases.
879000	907000	Of course, Nintendo once in a while does these direct for their big AAA games. That's when we, you know, got an update on Metroid Dread and that announcement and all that good stuff. And, you know, some of the other Yeah, when we found out we get WarioWare and that stuff. I think that was all E3. But it seems like about once a month, maybe once every six weeks, they're putting out these Indie World that show new games that are showing up on the eShop and other ways to get, you know, switch games than just pre ordering them at local store.
908000	923000	There were a lot of games that were talked about. So let's talk about and if you want to mention if you want to talk in depth about any of these Loki just stop me as I go. I think the first one that's gotten a lot of people's attention is Bomb Rush Cyber Funk, because it is basically Jet Set Radio without being called Jet Set Radio.
924000	946000	I get a very blood stained ritual of the, not Symphony of the Night, but ritual of the moment or whatever that it is, where it's not Castlevania, but Wink, you know, so Bomb Rush Cyber Funk gives me very that. Apparently, series composer Hideki Naganuma is actually in this game, who was from Jet Set Radio. So that is pretty awesome.
947000	964000	It will be coming out to Switch and then other platforms, I guess, come a week later. So the game is also coming to like, you know, PlayStation 5 and all that. But I'm sure people will be looking out for it on the Switch. That's for sure. And have that to go.
965000	976000	Yeah, Dark Tetsuya in chat says he's doing the music apparently keeping an eye on that one for sure. It wasn't the music like part of what everybody loved about, you know, Jet Set Radio. I want Chibomato to be in the game, even if they broke up years ago.
977000	989000	Other games, Toem, a photo adventure. I think that might have been the one that Jason was referencing in the intro there at the top of the show. We have that. Loop Hero is going to be coming out to Switch this year as well.
990000	997000	A lot of these types of announcements are like, oh, these games are coming to Switch too, which, you know, is the way people like to enjoy games sometimes.
998000	1003000	Necrobarista, The Final Pour came out now.
1004000	1005000	That's a nice name.
1006000	1014000	Yes, you gotta love the punny names. Garden Story just came out and they had showed that one, I think the last time they did it in Indie World, and they did the whole It's Out Today thing.
1014000	1025000	Another game that they did in It's Out Today event 4 was Boyfriend Dungeon came out. And that actually isn't exclusive to Switch because that came out on Game Pass as well.
1026000	1036000	I checked out the game on Xbox Game Pass for a little bit. I gotta say, I went through that very first basic dungeon, like the mall. I didn't like the way it felt.
1036000	1045000	It didn't, it didn't, I don't know. So I get up, I gotta play it more. I was kind of interested, the dating sim part was cracking me up, obviously. It's just, it's just ridiculous, but you know, in a good way.
1046000	1052000	You know, this Boyfriend Dungeon game actually is getting a lot of talk too, because, and I noticed this when I started the game.
1053000	1060000	It's, it's, you know, it's pretty inclusive, which is cool. Like, you know, you pick your pronouns, you can make your character like whatever you want, basically.
1060000	1073000	But there's also a very interesting warning that kind of cautions you like, hey, this game deals with themes of like, there's like stalking and abuse and something that's basically a content warning right at the top of the game.
1074000	1088000	So I thought that was interesting. And then what I also thought was, you know, just as somebody who's been through it a few years ago, I thought it was very interesting that the game told me that there is a character called Mom that will send you supportive text messages throughout the game.
1088000	1098000	And do you want to disable this character? And I did kind of think like, you know, because y'all, some of you were here four years ago when my mom passed away, and it was a very tough time.
1099000	1105000	And if I'd played the game four years ago, I probably would have been like, you know what, no, but I would have been very thankful for the game asking.
1106000	1114000	Now it's, you know, it's, it's whatever I can, I can do that. But I thought that was interesting. It was very considerate. And I don't see that in a lot of games.
1114000	1121000	But you know what's interesting, Loki? You know what's really interesting? Have you been following this? As much as they've been considerate, it's not enough.
1122000	1135000	It's not enough for some of the people on Twitter. Some of the people on Twitter are a little upset that even though you have the warning, you still have a character in the game who is really, really creepy stalkery.
1135000	1147000	I haven't played enough of the game to know firsthand what that is. But I, look, I'm all for like content warnings. I'm all for customizability.
1148000	1157000	But I think when you're tweeting the developer of the game going, you're doing this without my consent. I think you're taking it way too far. Like straight up.
1158000	1169000	And here's the thing is you're, you're actually actively harming that word consent and what it really means. You had consent when you turn the game on and you can revoke consent at any time by turning the game off.
1169000	1179000	And like, I'm not saying that there can't be criticism about a storyline and that we can't be like, you know, critical of those sorts of things.
1180000	1191000	But at the same time, like a lot of folks play, like where's, where's the irritation at games that celebrate murder? You know, like an actual murder and killing people.
1191000	1203000	It's just, I, I, it's just, I feel like this developer tried really hard to do a good thing and they did do a good thing and to see them get shit on for doing a good thing is like really irritating to me.
1204000	1212000	I don't know why, but I just, yeah, I think it's, it's the part of some of that online culture that a lot of people really can't stand.
1212000	1222000	Questbuster in chat says, I don't know if this made the news roll, but there was a small article on a few sites that the dev was going to update their content warning over this next week.
1223000	1232000	Thank you for clarifying that. That's right. They did say they were going to update the content warning. And I'm talking about replies to that that are still saying it's not enough.
1233000	1246000	And I'm, I'm very much like this game just probably isn't for you. Like, you know, there's maybe other video games that will not have this same thing.
1247000	1259000	I don't know. You know, it's a tricky, tricky thing. I've dealt with stalking and I've dealt with all that stuff. And again, I haven't played into this game where that kind of thing might bother me or whatever.
1259000	1267000	But like, I've certainly played video games before where I was playing them, I was playing them, then something really, really violent or gory happened.
1268000	1279000	And I was just like, not for me, click off. And that's what I did. And I didn't tweet the developer going, how dare you or anything like that. I just said, you know what, there's all sorts of games out there and this one wasn't for me.
1280000	1287000	Why didn't you tweet the developer? I mean, they need to know that you were unhappy. They are desperate to find out.
1287000	1293000	Because honestly, like, what good does it do at the end of the day? You know, it was just, yeah.
1294000	1299000	I'll have you know, nobody with IBS has reached out to me about Pixel Poops number two. So I'm glad I haven't offended anybody yet.
1300000	1302000	Not yet. Not yet.
1303000	1311000	You have to be like, actually, people have to actually know about your game in order to, you know, offend somebody with it. So it's fine.
1311000	1320000	It is, but it is sad to think that if you had put more offensive content in there, it probably would have sold more. Just interesting.
1321000	1322000	There's always time. I can add more.
1323000	1333000	Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. Fifth Dream in chat brings up the mom thing and says, I think about that every time Animal Crossing sends mail from mom.
1333000	1342000	Yeah. I mean, it's nice that the game, like, tells you, like, what's gonna happen and what's going on. So there's that.
1343000	1349000	All right. Anyway, sorry, I went on a bit of a tangent there, but it was something I saw on Twitter this week that just really, really, like, it just irked me.
1350000	1359000	I was just like, this is just, it's too much. It's too far. All right. Moving on. Axiom Verge 2 just came out on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.
1360000	1368000	I haven't, I really liked the first game, but I'm a little hesitant on the second game. I'm hearing it's not getting the same warm reception.
1369000	1373000	That apparently a lot of the battle has gone very melee in the game, which is a little weird for a Metroidvania.
1374000	1383000	But yeah, I haven't played it myself, but I just, some of the early things I've been hearing from my friends that also like the original Axiom Verge, not really as warm on the game.
1383000	1389000	But what do you guys in chat think? Have any of you in chat been playing Axiom Verge 2? I'd be very curious. So, all right.
1390000	1403000	Brilliant comment from SSJ100Matt. I mean, I hate to be harsh, but we can only please everyone. I think we can't please everyone, but at some point the onus is on the person to realize that not everything is about them.
1404000	1417000	Let's see. Other stuff that they announced at the Nintendo Indie World. Metal Slug Tactics is coming in 2022. Yeah, I thought they had already confirmed that for Switch at some point, but it's nice to have the time frame.
1418000	1423000	Yeah, that was during the SNK thing that they did where they talked about Metal Slug.
1424000	1426000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that.
1427000	1430000	Was that during that? It was during something. I know we've had a trailer for it already.
1430000	1445000	Yeah. Tetris Effect is coming out on October 8th for the Switch. That's a little bit of a surprise because, you know, that game kind of started as like a VR, you know, really crisp 4K on Epic Store kind of game.
1446000	1448000	Yeah, it's a crisp 720p.
1449000	1457000	But it is Tetris at the end of the day. But, you know, it'll be nice to take that on the go. I think some people are going to be very happy they can take that experience on the go.
1458000	1470000	I still think it's better in an immersive environment, but, you know, if you're kind of chilling on the train or whatever and you have your big old headphones on and you have that really awesome music in the game and so forth, you can probably find your zone in that game.
1470000	1479000	You know what would be even cooler is if they had a mode to play it where, you know, it's in like a portrait or landscape instead of like portrait.
1480000	1481000	Oh, like tilted.
1482000	1486000	I'm sorry. I'm getting confused. Yeah. Basically, so it takes up more screen real estate.
1487000	1497000	Yeah, that would be awesome actually. That would be a neat feature. You know, there's already like a retro skin in it and you see it in some of the competitive modes and I think you can unlock it.
1497000	1507000	But it is basically Tetris the NES cartridge skin. I think they call it 1989 or something is the skin name. And it's it's pretty awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
1508000	1516000	Loki. Now there's something to tweet the developers, you know, I don't say like F U you effing F, but I would tweet the developers and say, hey, it would be cool if you did this.
1517000	1519000	I mean, they may listen, they may not. We'll see.
1520000	1524000	Astroneer is another game coming out on Switch in early 2022.
1525000	1536000	Slime Rancher Plortable. That is that is that was that Plortable because they're slimes. Get it? So Slime Rancher came out now on Switch for you slime ranching fans.
1537000	1546000	Curious Expedition 2 also was released. Gang Beasts is coming out in September and Eastward is launching on September 16th.
1546000	1552000	So a lot of updates. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of updates on some games there over Nintendo's camp.
1553000	1558000	And, you know, this is in addition to all the AAA stuff like the WarioWare and the Metroid Dread.
1559000	1566000	So I think it's going to be a pretty good holiday for Switch. I imagine they're still going to sell those things like crazy, even if, you know, a Switch Pro didn't end up happening right now.
1566000	1577000	So. All right. Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks and see if we played any of those games or I did mention I played Boyfriend Dungeon a little bit, but not a lot of it.
1578000	1582000	If we played some of those games or something else this week, let's get into it. How was your gaming week, Loki?
1583000	1590000	It's still Minecraft. I that's what I have been playing. And I think I put out a video this week. I can't remember.
1591000	1609000	So, yeah, I did that. And this week has been mainly just designing stuff offline. I also figured out some of the nuances with the server I play on and how to get it to spawn a lot of mobs, just positioning accounts in a certain way.
1609000	1618000	So that was a fun experiment to do. And yeah, so it's been just that this week. I haven't really been playing too much Minecraft, actually.
1619000	1632000	Just cutting back a little bit because I was so much into it last week. But yeah, a lot of it designing stuff offline. So I've been working on Super Smelter for my Tango build I did to put inside of it.
1632000	1644000	So that'll be coming soon. Just finalize kind of a design for that today. And then, yeah, I do want to get to other things, you know, at some point.
1645000	1654000	Speaking of which, we kind of referenced Pixel Poops number two. I have not forgotten that I at one point promised to do a physical version of that.
1654000	1662000	And it's still in the back of my head, I have to finish two more levels for that to polish off the 10 additional levels I was going to do.
1663000	1669000	And I have to see if there's other things I want to add to it. I may not do that. I may just do the levels and call it a day.
1670000	1677000	But yeah, I do want to do that at some point soon. The problem is I don't know how I'm going to sell those yet or like, like how to even do that.
1677000	1688000	So like, aside from like, hey, DM me on Discord or something like that, that's not really reliable way of doing things. But that may be what it is, considering the small quantities. So we'll see.
1689000	1697000	Or just do a Kickstarter that is like, the goal is only like two copies of the game being sold. And then, you know, fill your orders that way. Maybe I don't know.
1698000	1701000	Well, yeah, that's tough, too. Because like, I don't know.
1702000	1708000	You'll sell at least two copies. You'll sell at least two copies. Bobby Blackwell said he'd buy one in Pod Culture City.
1709000	1720000	Yeah, I'm not worried about selling copies. Like, I don't have a problem with that. Like, it's just like, I want to make sure that I can fulfill stuff like, you know, in a normal process.
1721000	1727000	I still want it would be nice to have like a manual or like a box or something like that. And I don't even know how to source all that stuff.
1727000	1739000	And that just adds to the cost. I have, like I said, enough to make like 12 copies right now. All the carts and everything, but I just have to finalize the ROM for that.
1740000	1750000	And like, I've already added like stuff like I have the two other playable characters in there. And I have to remember if I actually adjusted, because they were supposed to play a little bit differently.
1750000	1762000	So I've got to like, you know, I guess female presenting characters, and then 10 more levels. So that that's something and what else did I do?
1763000	1776000	I think I also changed the way that the continues work. So it doesn't put you at the end of it doesn't restart you to the beginning of each world, it just to the level that you died in, which is a little bit more fair.
1776000	1789000	So there's some like small tweaks for that. But yeah, I mean, they have like better like tutorials and stuff out there for how to do animated title tiles and stuff like that.
1790000	1805000	Like, I don't want to do that. But I probably draw the line traveling. I'll probably just do two more levels and call it a day. I still it still annoys me that the random the random turn direction code in there doesn't quite work right all the time.
1806000	1818000	So I but I don't think I'll ever be able to fix that because I don't know how it's colliding. Because there's no easy way to debug that stuff. But yeah, two more levels and then probably call it a day.
1819000	1828000	I'm also thinking about once I do physically release that stuff that I may end up dropping the price of the digital game and stuff. We'll see. I don't know.
1828000	1835000	Bobby in chat says, or links to Etsy as a possible source to help with some of your issues.
1836000	1842000	Yeah, I guess I could do that. Why are people selling like The Legend of Zelda? That's not homebrew.
1844000	1850000	I'm pretty sure that Mario. This is not Super Mario Bros. 3. This is Mario Bros. 2.
1851000	1857000	That's clearly Super Mario Bros. 2 and the list says Super Mario Bros. 3. Jesus, people can not read.
1858000	1861000	So this is why Loki's not using Etsy. All right.
1862000	1869000	But yeah, sure. We can we can do something like that. We'll figure something out. Maybe Etsy is an idea.
1870000	1872000	All right. Anything else for gaming week?
1873000	1874000	That's it.
1874000	1885000	My gaming week. A lot of the stuff I usually talk about. Still more Dibba Daylight. Still more Final Fantasy 14. My lowest level on any class now is 58.
1886000	1893000	So by this time next week, I should have everything at least 60. So I've got three more classes to level up. Monk, Black Mage and Warrior.
1894000	1902000	And then once I get them to 80, everything is max level because I am crazy when it comes to Final Fantasy 14. But I love that game.
1902000	1916000	And then, yeah, so I was playing most that same stuff. And then Friday or I guess late Thursday night, if you will, Hades came out on Xbox Series X under Xbox Game Pass.
1917000	1924000	And it also released on PlayStation 5. It released on like Windows Store. Now Hades has already been out on Steam and Switch.
1925000	1931000	And you all know it won like a lot of Game of the Year recognitions in the last year. And there's a reason for that. The game is good.
1932000	1938000	I decided to start a new game on Series X just to see how it played and, you know, the nice smooth 60 frames a second and, you know, all that stuff.
1939000	1948000	And I gotta say, it looks really good. It plays great. In fact, it plays so nicely. I spent all fucking day Saturday playing Hades. All day Saturday playing Hades.
1949000	1954000	I even did a stream at some point on Saturday where I was just doing more Hades on stream and then I was playing before and after that.
1954000	1964000	And yeah, I just, the game is fantastic. I don't know what to say. A lot of people feel a certain kind of way when they hear it's a roguelike.
1965000	1976000	But like it does the genre so well that it's probably the best representation of like a roguelike type of game in that whole genre that I've really seen.
1976000	1983000	And, you know, even if you hate roguelikes, I'd still encourage you to give Hades a try, especially because it's on Game Pass.
1984000	1994000	You know, I always say I'm not a big fan of sports games, but you know what? I love NBA Jam. I like Blades of Steel. I even tried one of the newer hockey games that came out because it was on Game Pass.
1994000	2003000	So yeah, I play those games. I don't like shooters, but I still will, I still get sucked into a Halo game now and then. I enjoyed the Doom revival.
2004000	2012000	So, you know, there's just, there's certain, there's exceptions to every rule, right? And I think Hades is really worth a look, no matter how you feel about those roguelike type of games.
2013000	2020000	It's just the customizability and the way the builds work, you really get a different type of playthrough every time you go through the game.
2020000	2035000	And that's what makes it really interesting to me. So, yeah, I'm loving it. So, I got all the way to Hades, but I have yet, which is further than I got the last time I played through the game.
2036000	2042000	But I haven't, I was not able to beat him yet. Although I had a really good shotgun build, or I think it's railgun. I had a really good railgun build.
2042000	2050000	And I'm really upset. I was firing three rockets. I thought it was good. He just does too much damage. I need a build with more damage mitigation or something like that.
2051000	2059000	So, I'll get there. I'll get there. You just make little improvements to the character every time. That's what a roguelike's all about. So, I'll get there.
2059000	2072000	But yeah, Hades. Check it out. Otherwise, I did play that little bit of Boyfriend Dungeon I talked about earlier, but not really enough to talk much more about it. Hades kind of knocked that out of the way on getting my attention.
2073000	2084000	It came up on Bobby's show at the end. He asked me how Yakuza is going. That is still on hold a little bit, but I will pick it back up, I promise. But now I'm obsessed with beating Hades first.
2085000	2094000	S2100Matt says, I've been waiting for Hades to come to Xbox. Now that it's here, I have not a lot of time to play. Cry. Well, I mean, it shouldn't go away that fast.
2095000	2102000	I mean, what's the fastest a game disappeared from Game Pass? Grand Theft Auto 5, right? But it was up at least four months or so, wasn't it?
2103000	2114000	Some folks in chat are talking about the Diablo 2 beta. Questbuster says, have been trying out the Diablo 2 resurrected beta thanks to a free code. Definitely on the pretty side.
2115000	2128000	I meant to do the Twitch thing to get a code and I wanted to try it for myself, but I played Hades all fucking day on Saturday. I just didn't get around to Diablo 2.
2128000	2136000	I'll see how the reception is when the actual game comes out and take it from there. So, obviously some of the recent stuff that's been going on with Blizzard.
2137000	2144000	I mean, I'm not even talking about the, well, I guess I am a little bit. I can't lie, that stuff does factor into it a little bit.
2145000	2154000	But I'm just not like gung ho on like, I've got to do the pay full price for this game several months in advance thing. I'm just not at a point where I want to do that.
2154000	2163000	Like if the game is good, I will buy it when it's out. I'm not in a rush to play it day one. Because if it's good, it'll last a lot longer than one day. That's for sure.
2164000	2175000	So, all right. That's it for our gaming weeks. So we will get into some more news. I will mention real quick, we will be not having a show Labor Day weekend.
2175000	2185000	I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta. Yes, they're still doing a Dragon Con this year. Yes, there's a lot of precautions in place, like mandatory mask not stuff.
2186000	2190000	They're not going to have as many people either. This is the first year they're limiting the number of tickets to the people that can go.
2191000	2199000	So it's going to be an interesting year. But I'm excited to be, right now my tentative schedule has seven panels on it.
2199000	2205000	Three of them on the gaming track and four of them on digital media. That could change. It's very likely to change.
2206000	2212000	So I will kind of give an update when the schedule is locked in. The schedule will be locked in a week or two out from Dragon Con.
2213000	2227000	And I'll let you know all the panels I'm doing. There is one panel right now, tentatively, that I'm doing with someone that does something for a game company that is large and you would know them.
2227000	2237000	And that's the one I'm really hyped about. So we'll see what plays out with that. I will give you more details in a couple weeks, I promise.
2238000	2245000	I have to wait for it to get locked in because the moment I open my fat mouth and say I'm doing this, this, and this is when, oh, we had some changes.
2246000	2250000	We had a schedule change and now there was a conflict so we put somebody else on it. You know that's how it goes every time.
2251000	2255000	So I'm going to keep my mouth shut. All right, let's move on. We have some other news. Loki?
2255000	2268000	Yes, yes, yes. Unfortunately, we have news that there's been some take two shenanigans when it comes to Grand Theft Auto mods.
2269000	2278000	Yet again, they have gone through trying to DMCA copyright claim lots of different mods that are out there, including Vice City Remastered.
2279000	2293000	They had Liberty City Project, Open Manhunt, Bulworth. Yeah, so lots of different projects that are on ModDB that are getting taken down.
2294000	2305000	Basically, most of these mods had to do with taking older games like Vice City, for example, and porting it to the Grand Theft Auto 5 engine or porting it to newer engines.
2305000	2312000	And basically at this point, you know, they just want to say that they have literally nothing else they could do other than comply with this.
2313000	2322000	You know, they basically say it's worth noting that, you know, the EULA's for these games kind of forbid modifications, which is stupid if you ask me.
2323000	2329000	But they're, you know, they're trying to challenge it, but we'll see what actually happens with that.
2329000	2336000	Also, like the Grand Theft Auto 5 cheat menu was taken down as well, which is kind of annoying because those are fun.
2337000	2339000	But you may be wondering, why are they doing this?
2340000	2346000	Well, it's because Rockstar Games in their infinite wisdom is going to do the unthinkable.
2347000	2349000	No, they're just going to rerelease Grand Theft Auto again.
2349000	2360000	So they're apparently going to be putting out a trilogy of the PlayStation 2 games onto the Switch, including Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas.
2361000	2363000	I am so sick of those games coming back out again.
2364000	2368000	Like, I don't think they need to be remastered.
2369000	2370000	They can't really be remastered anymore.
2370000	2380000	Those games look so basic, like you already did the upscale, you know, thing to this back in, you know, the Xbox 360 era and stuff like that.
2381000	2382000	Like, do we really need to do this again?
2383000	2386000	It's just stupid at this point, but whatever, it's going to become.
2387000	2390000	I'm surprised you're not, you're not interested, but I guess that's because...
2391000	2393000	I'm not interested because they haven't put out a new game in like years now.
2394000	2395000	Like when's the last time Grand Theft Auto 5 came out?
2396000	2397000	Well, that was like six years ago.
2398000	2399000	Probably even more than that, probably at this point.
2400000	2404000	Like, it's been a long time. Put out a new game. Like, seriously.
2405000	2410000	Our chat is lighting up on this. Mike Deft points out the thing is they keep selling. Yeah, that's true.
2411000	2419000	Well, the thing is, yeah, the online they keep putting stuff out for, but like, I just don't think, you know, this is worth, I'm not going to buy it on the Switch, that's for sure.
2420000	2425000	I have it already on PC. I don't need it. I played those games to death. Like, I don't need to do that.
2425000	2431000	Fifth Dream says we don't need remasters every gen, especially when they did it before three years ago.
2432000	2439000	SGA 100 map brings up an interesting legal issue that the games had. I'm really excited for the trilogy, though I wonder what the soundtracks will be like.
2440000	2444000	Yeah. Yeah, those soundtracks, they keep getting songs removed from it because they have to re-license it.
2445000	2453000	Like, I'd be more interested in them, with them bringing out either brand new game, first off, or having them like, say, update the game, like kind of do what the modders did.
2453000	2465000	You know, hey, let's bring these games into a modern engine or something like that. The problem is you can't really do that because those games had, were so limited by memory capacity and stuff that they're very, like, empty.
2466000	2473000	Well, maybe not so much San Andreas, but like, three. If you go back and play three, it's an empty map. Like, it's pretty empty.
2474000	2479000	Here's how you fix the soundtrack issue because the games are being re-released according to this rumor for the Nintendo Switch.
2479000	2490000	So what you do is you have Nintendo music replace the licensed music that was there before so that you can actually have, like, the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo as you're mass murdering people on the street.
2491000	2493000	And that would be a lot of fun, wouldn't it?
2494000	2501000	And then Waluigi can actually be a skin that you can download and replace the protagonist in any of the games with.
2502000	2504000	Wouldn't that be great?
2505000	2509000	Grant Theft Law Waluigi. I mean, talk about this series.
2510000	2514000	It will never do that. Like, they will never do that because, god forbid, they associate.
2515000	2517000	God forbid Waluigi is seen with a gun.
2519000	2520000	Never gonna happen.
2521000	2526000	So, like, I just don't, I'm not interested in these coming back.
2527000	2532000	Like, it's been, they've been released so many times already. Like, I don't need to have them come to the Switch.
2533000	2534000	Like, no one is, like, demanding that stuff.
2535000	2537000	And the last port that they did of these wasn't very good anyway.
2538000	2540000	So, why would I bother with it?
2541000	2546000	Like, honestly, the modders have probably done a better job porting that stuff over than these guys have.
2546000	2548000	And there's, like, a lot more exciting stuff that they've done.
2549000	2550000	Like, multiplayer and stuff like that.
2551000	2552000	So, I'd rather see that.
2553000	2560000	But we'll never see that because Rockstar makes a billion dollars off of their stupid Rock, you know, Grant Theft Auto Online.
2561000	2562000	Which is fine. That's entertaining for people.
2563000	2564000	But, like, kind of want a new game.
2565000	2569000	I don't want to play Grant Theft Auto Online because it's a grindy shitfest.
2570000	2574000	And the people that play it, or a lot of the people that play it, are complete assholes.
2574000	2576000	So, I don't want to play with them.
2577000	2580000	I would rather just, you know, play a new game.
2581000	2588000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, sure, how about Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi covered overalls or something for the characters?
2589000	2592000	That's just plumber clothes or something that they could release.
2593000	2597000	Yeah, but that would be effort beyond just porting the game over to a new engine.
2598000	2600000	Sure, whatever. It's never going to happen.
2600000	2606000	Okay, Estio 100 Matt has the very practical answer here that Loki, surely you have to be considering is that, why not both?
2607000	2609000	Why not come out with this while they make the new one?
2610000	2613000	Not like these games are taking away assets from the team making the new game.
2614000	2617000	They're not even Rockstar. It's probably going to be porting this stuff over.
2618000	2620000	They're going to outsource it to a third-party company to do this.
2621000	2623000	It's literally no work for them.
2624000	2626000	So, maybe there will be a Grant Theft Auto 6 someday.
2626000	2630000	Yeah, eventually someday. But do I really want to play that?
2631000	2633000	Look at how they've supported Red Dead 2. It's pretty awesome.
2634000	2639000	But they haven't supported Red Dead Online at all because they're not making as much money off of it.
2640000	2642000	I would even be fine with them.
2643000	2645000	You know what I'd really like to see it port of?
2646000	2648000	You want to do an HD remaster or something?
2649000	2651000	HD remaster the Grant Theft Auto 4 games.
2652000	2653000	That's what you need to do.
2653000	2655000	That would get me interested in actually playing that stuff.
2656000	2657000	Because those games were fun.
2658000	2659000	And that hasn't been remastered yet.
2660000	2661000	So, there you go. Do that.
2662000	2665000	Not the first, not 3, 4, or not 3 in Vice City.
2666000	2667000	3, 3, and 3.
2668000	2669000	3, 3, and 3, yeah.
2670000	2671000	Well, hey, that's three different games. You know what?
2672000	2676000	We've had Grant Theft Auto 5 on three different generations of consoles at this point.
2677000	2679000	So, it's like, whatever.
2680000	2683000	Grant Theft Auto 5 is going to become the meme that Skyrim is at some point soon.
2684000	2685000	If not already.
2686000	2688000	Alright, not until we have an Alexa version, that's for sure.
2689000	2691000	Oops, sorry, I said the name of the device. Sorry if I set it off.
2692000	2693000	But, you know what though?
2694000	2695000	You know what?
2696000	2700000	As much crap as we give Todd Howard and Skyrim and shoving that down our throats every few years?
2701000	2703000	At least that game I can use mods in.
2704000	2705000	So, you know.
2706000	2707000	Douche.
2707000	2710000	Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about another online game.
2711000	2712000	One that I play way too much of.
2713000	2720000	Dead by Daylight, and Dead by Daylight, you know, for as fucking buggy as fuck as that game is sometimes.
2721000	2723000	Somehow it is still insanely popular.
2724000	2725000	You know there's like two maps right now they just had to disable?
2726000	2727000	Because somehow they broke.
2728000	2732000	And it's because of the way that this game is just spaghetti coded and it's been that way for like the past five years.
2732000	2734000	But yet the game is so damn much fun.
2735000	2736000	And it's a lot of fun to watch.
2737000	2738000	I love watching people play it on Twitch.
2739000	2740000	It's just so exciting and all that stuff.
2741000	2743000	But anyway, obviously you all know I'm a fan of Dead by Daylight.
2744000	2745000	So is Dark Sakura as well.
2746000	2749000	And, you know, just a few months ago we had the release of the Resident Evil chapter.
2750000	2754000	Which gave Jill, Leon, and then of course you could actually change Jill into Claire.
2755000	2756000	You could change Leon into Chris.
2757000	2759000	And Nemesis. There's like five different characters that got added to Dead by Daylight with that.
2760000	2761000	It's a lot of fun.
2762000	2765000	So we're already looking at what is the next DLC to come out.
2766000	2770000	What's kind of interesting is that usually you don't get a bunch of licensed stuff back to back.
2771000	2772000	You get original characters.
2773000	2776000	And Dead by Daylight has some, you know, pretty interesting original killers as well.
2777000	2778000	Like the Blight was a recent killer.
2779000	2781000	The Trickster was, you know, in a recent patch.
2782000	2787000	And is a very good character even if he's got a lot of balance problems in the game right now.
2788000	2789000	But that's the buggy part.
2789000	2794000	But it looks like if rumors are to be believed, and honestly I'm talking rumors to the point of
2795000	2798000	even Dead by Daylight is posting their own teasers and people are putting it together.
2799000	2803000	It looks like we are getting another license as the next DLC.
2804000	2808000	And it's going to be Hellraiser is going to be the next DLC for Dead by Daylight.
2809000	2810000	And I think that is pretty interesting.
2811000	2818000	Because what's also interesting about this is that it may not actually be a full DLC.
2819000	2824000	It may be what they call a paragraph, which means it is just a killer or a survivor.
2825000	2828000	And in the case of Hellraiser, obviously it's going to be Pinhead.
2829000	2830000	It's going to be a survivor.
2831000	2832000	Obviously it's Pinhead.
2833000	2835000	It's just the question is what form of Pinhead is it going to be.
2836000	2839000	And I think they actually have another name, Cenobites or whatever.
2840000	2841000	There is a lady Cenobite.
2842000	2843000	So maybe there could be DLC, I don't know.
2844000	2848000	But assumably the iconic Pinhead from the 1987.
2849000	2852000	It's going to be Gottmik as Pinhead because you all know I love my Drag Race.
2853000	2854000	But I doubt that will be a DLC.
2855000	2858000	But the iconic 1987 Pinhead is almost certainly going to be in the game.
2859000	2860000	We will find out on Tuesday.
2861000	2864000	Public Test Realm goes live on Tuesday and we are going to see do we get a survivor with it.
2865000	2868000	Because quick, name a character from the Hellraiser franchise.
2869000	2871000	And some of the horror movie buffs probably can jump right in and say something.
2872000	2874000	But there is not as many iconic survivors.
2874000	2879000	But if you look at Dead by Daylight's history, Ghostface didn't come with a survivor.
2880000	2883000	And if anything deserved to come with a survivor, that should have.
2884000	2891000	You absolutely should have had Casey, Drew Barrymore, or Neve Campbell, or Gail Weathers, or fucking all of them honestly.
2892000	2893000	There's so many people.
2894000	2899000	Not putting one of those strong women as a survivor was quite frankly homophobic on the part of Behavior Entertainment.
2899000	2908000	And I'm going to be tweeting them how they are homophobic by not including the entire cast of Scream in their DLC.
2909000	2915000	I saw people thinking that there was going to be a character from Five Nights at Freddy's as one of the killers as well.
2916000	2923000	Well apparently a lot of the same type of teaser stuff kind of works for Five Nights at Freddy's.
2923000	2928000	But they went so far as to, well this most latest one, it says 1987 in the corner.
2929000	2937000	When Behavior uploaded it to a Chinese YouTube website, whatever their version of YouTube is, they forgot that the file names are visible on there.
2938000	2939000	And it actually was called Hellraiser Teaser.
2940000	2941000	And this was by the official...
2942000	2947000	And horror fans knew. Because there's this TV static and you see an image in it.
2947000	2952000	And they 100% knew it was Hellraiser from that.
2953000	2957000	So, s2100matt says curious what the level would be. There may not be one.
2958000	2961000	If it is a paragraph and it's just the killer, again Ghostface was that way.
2962000	2967000	Bubba or Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was also that way.
2968000	2970000	There was no map because it was only the killer and no survivor.
2971000	2975000	They've also done the other way around where there's a survivor and no killer and they didn't get maps either.
2975000	2977000	Bill from Left 4 Dead is a good example of that.
2978000	2980000	Ash from Evil Dead is another good example of that.
2981000	2986000	Ash from Evil Dead is the one piece of DLC I do not own for Dead by Daylight because he's not a good character in the game.
2987000	2991000	Sorry. No slander to the Evil Dead fans, but his perks suck.
2992000	2996000	He's too loud, so it's one I've really been putting off, that's for sure.
2997000	3003000	Questbuster in chat says I hope Pinhead will get to say I have such sights to show you in the game.
3003000	3007000	They don't usually talk, but maybe. So I don't know.
3008000	3013000	Locopoco corrects me and says Leatherface had a variation of a map. He came with the Grim Pantry map.
3014000	3017000	Okay, my bad. I didn't think he came with a map. So I guess there is that.
3018000	3023000	And then Locopoco does also point out licensing back to back has happened before because there was Ghostface and Stranger Things.
3024000	3025000	Alright, fair enough.
3026000	3034000	But you still get what I'm saying is that don't put your expectations that every pack for Dead by Daylight is going to be licensed characters.
3035000	3040000	I really thought that we were going to get Candyman because that was where some of the early rumors were at.
3041000	3046000	And with the new movie coming out it makes perfect sense, so I'm kind of surprised it's not that.
3047000	3052000	But maybe that'll be the next one. That would be really something if we got three licenses in a row.
3052000	3054000	But yeah, that would be something else.
3055000	3060000	Anyway, we don't know what the talents are going to be or anything like that. Again, we'll find out on Tuesday.
3061000	3066000	Some people are saying they creep teleport, so maybe there would be a teleportation type of thing.
3067000	3072000	The only character I could think of that functions similarly is Nurse kind of does this teleport thing.
3073000	3079000	So it could be interesting if that's the mechanic that they, I mean, obviously you don't want to just see a carbon copy of another killer.
3079000	3084000	You know, Nemesis kind of, you know, they added some neat things for Nemesis, I gotta say.
3085000	3093000	Even though the virus type of thing is sort of in the game with the plague, although it functions a lot differently,
3094000	3098000	that whole fact that Nemesis has the AI zombies, that was like a completely new thing.
3099000	3104000	So it'll be interesting if they, maybe they'll bring something new to the table for Pinhead as well. I don't know.
3104000	3110000	So anyway, by the time some of you hear this podcast, if you listen midweek, that information may already be out there.
3111000	3115000	So that'll be exciting to see. Loki, do you keep changing camera angles? What the hell are you doing over there?
3116000	3124000	No, my camera, it, so my camera software keeps defaulting to my camera that's in my actual laptop for God knows what reason.
3125000	3132000	I don't know why, but I noticed it like switching it. I keep switching it back and it's like, no, I want to do the other camera.
3132000	3136000	I don't know what the hell's wrong with it. Sorry, sorry, podcast folks.
3137000	3139000	I'm going to shut the, I'm going to shut the camera off for a second.
3140000	3145000	Every time I look up there, Loki's doing this camera one, camera two, camera one, camera two.
3146000	3149000	And I'm like, stop it. What do you show? What do you, why are you switching your camera?
3150000	3154000	I'm not the software's in like, why are you doing this? Like stop doing that.
3155000	3157000	I get it. I get it now. Yeah. I'm having similar problems.
3157000	3162000	Some of you that watch the show live probably notice I'm always having to reset my camera at the top of the show.
3163000	3169000	That's because for some reason Discord for, and cause I do that call with Bobby on his show right before we do this.
3170000	3173000	Discord for whatever reason forces me to use low resolution and I can't change it.
3174000	3180000	And so when we start, if I don't remember to change it between the two shows, it doesn't start high res for this one, which is so weird.
3180000	3193000	Anyway, um, SHJ100Matt in chat says, if they ever decide to end the game Dead by Daylight, which I'm not advocating, the last DLC should be a space level because every horror series eventually ends in space.
3194000	3197000	Well, in my opinion, absolutely the last quote unquote DLC.
3198000	3199000	Are we seeing Jason X DLC?
3200000	3202000	Thank you for taking my joke before I'm finished.
3202000	3209000	Yes. I think Jason should be the last DLC they ever do because it would be one of those we finished where we started kind of things.
3210000	3218000	Because you might remember Dead by Daylight came out like only a couple months after that Friday the 13th game came out and then Friday the 13th had all those issues with the licenses and everything.
3219000	3225000	So it, it unfortunately kind of stalled out even though that was a great game when it first came out, but they hit so many issues licensing and things didn't really go anywhere.
3226000	3231000	So if Jason came to Dead by Daylight, that would really be full circle and absolutely it should be Jason in space.
3232000	3233000	It's Freddy Krueger in the game?
3234000	3236000	Yes. Well, new Freddy is in the game.
3237000	3238000	New Freddy? Eh, who cares?
3239000	3247000	Yeah, it's still Freddy. But the survivor character is Quentin, who's a character from the reboot, not in the original.
3247000	3254000	So that is a little weird, but that's, they were trying to push the newer movie, which for whatever reason was five years old at that time.
3255000	3263000	It was easier to get the rights. That's probably what it was. It was easier to get the rights to Jackie Earle Haley's face than it was Robert Englund probably. That's my guess anyway.
3264000	3268000	A lot of people in chat wanting Alien, Xenomorph, Predator.
3268000	3277000	Somebody was asking me about this the other day was like, could we get an Alien character, you know, something that's not like a human in Dead by Daylight?
3278000	3284000	And my answer was, well, we got Demogorgon. So yes, anything's possible. Anything's possible if you dream.
3285000	3291000	No one special says, what about Warwick Davis leprechaun character? Dude, that would be awesome.
3291000	3300000	The character I most want to see more than anything, as much as I joke about Drag Race, no, the character I most want to see more than anything is Tim Curry's Pennywise.
3301000	3310000	That's the character I want in Dead by Daylight more than anything. And the sad thing is there already is a clown character, but he's more of a clown.
3310000	3318000	Dead by Daylight kind of had this problem in the beginning anyway. It borrows a lot from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
3319000	3325000	And then they put in Billy, or the hillbilly, who is a chainsaw character, who is very much an homage to that.
3326000	3331000	And then they get the license for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so they have to create a second chainsaw killer.
3332000	3335000	Has he just gotten rid of the other one? I mean, I don't know.
3335000	3341000	The clown that's in the game now is very much the drunken clown stereotype type of thing.
3342000	3351000	So I think if they did a Tim Curry, Pennywise clown, they could make it very different. It wouldn't have to be the same thing.
3352000	3360000	That is my dream killer for Dead by Daylight, in case this comes up on a quiz in the future, is that Tim Curry is Pennywise.
3360000	3369000	Although with my luck, I will get the reboot Pennywise. Part of me says I would still take it, but no, I wouldn't. I reject it.
3370000	3376000	I would take new Pennywise as long as there's a way to get the skin for the old Pennywise, if that makes sense.
3377000	3385000	That's what I want. Alright. Enough Dead by Daylight. You hear enough of that on DarkSakura's stream and sometimes my personal stream when I stream.
3385000	3392000	We play a lot of Dead by Daylight, but that's because despite the buggy fucking mess that it is, it really is.
3393000	3400000	I loved when Jamie put it a couple weeks ago on the show, the Marvel Avengers universe of horror, and that really is what it is.
3401000	3406000	Wasn't that supposed to be the MonsterVerse and they never did anything with that aside from the Mummy movie, which sucked?
3407000	3410000	Yeah. I think they're still trying to make that happen, actually.
3410000	3421000	They are. Well, I'm sorry. No, it's not just the Mummy movie because it's the Mummy movie and the Invisible Man, but I don't think that movie is good either.
3422000	3430000	Maybe that movie was better than the Mummy. I mean, it's got to be better than Mummy, but it ain't gonna happen. Sorry.
3431000	3438000	Anything's possible. I never thought we'd see half these characters we're seeing in Dead by Daylight, so there is that.
3438000	3441000	All right. Let's move on. Next story, Loki.
3442000	3448000	Yeah. So PAX Australia has been canceled and they're replacing it with an online show.
3449000	3453000	Gee, I wonder why could it be this COVID-19 everywhere?
3454000	3465000	So, yeah, I mean, it's not a huge surprise that obviously a lot of these events are going online only for this year because things aren't necessarily getting better everywhere.
3465000	3471000	And there's a lot of people on vaccine and different Delta outbreaks, so it only makes sense.
3472000	3475000	So online only show will be the case for right now.
3476000	3484000	Yeah. Because it's important to point out PAX Prime, which actually hasn't been called that for like six years. I think it's now just PAX West.
3485000	3493000	PAX West is still happening Labor Day weekend. So you might be looking at this going, why is PAX Australia getting canceled when PAX West is still happening?
3493000	3506000	And the simple answer is the COVID situation in Australia is extremely different because they kind of dodged it the first time it was going around like this Delta variants really hitting them now.
3507000	3514000	So that's the kind of the difference. Unfortunately, you know, obviously we don't like to talk about COVID hitting areas.
3515000	3520000	And I think a lot fewer people vaccinated in Australia, if I'm not mistaken.
3521000	3522000	I don't know. Yeah.
3523000	3530000	That's what it boils down to, too. So it's a little different here where in the States anyone can get vaccinated at this point if they want it.
3531000	3533000	So it's just, you know.
3534000	3543000	You know. Yeah. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about the ID at Xbox event because we talked about the Nintendo indie event.
3544000	3548000	So let's talk a little bit about the Microsoft equivalent. So they had ID at Xbox.
3548000	3557000	So we also got some updates on some Xbox games and some this. I thought of you, Loki, with this first game on my list here, Lightyear Frontier.
3558000	3562000	Have you seen this? Because it's like a fart. It's a farming game with Max.
3563000	3566000	I mean, every farming game needs Max. So I'm down.
3567000	3571000	Loki, somebody literally thought the same thing and made this game. So you really should check this out.
3572000	3577000	It's four player co-op, but of course you can play it solo as well. And it's going to come out on Xbox and PC in 2022.
3578000	3583000	Apparently there is a mystery driven narrative that will keep you coming back for more Max.
3584000	3586000	The mystery is why do we have Max in this farming game?
3587000	3590000	Loki, why not have Max in this farming game?
3591000	3599000	That's what I want to see. Like, you know how we have like Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 2042? I want to see farming simulator 2042 with Max in it.
3600000	3601000	Yes. Yeah. There you go. Why not?
3601000	3607000	If you want your farming sims more traditional because you're, you know, boring. No, just kidding.
3608000	3614000	Stardew Valley is certainly not boring. A lot of people love that game and it's coming out on Xbox Game Pass this fall.
3615000	3621000	So if you've been putting off Stardew Valley, I suppose you can check that out. So another win for Xbox Game Pass there. That's pretty cool.
3622000	3630000	The Artful Escape is another game coming out. It is a teenage guitar prodigy who becomes a folk music legend.
3631000	3638000	And there's some various voice talents in this game, which is kind of interesting. It will be on Game Pass 9-9, September 9th. So that's kind of fun.
3639000	3644000	Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, out now. If you want to check that out, that was announced.
3645000	3651000	OlliOlli World will run at 120 frames a second and 4K in its cartoony style.
3652000	3659000	It's a skateboarding action platformer game, which is, it's actually the third game in the OlliOlli series. So that is out winter this year.
3660000	3670000	Aeon Drive was also talked about, which is I guess an action game, but it has a speedrun type of twist. So it sounds like fans of speedrunners will like that.
3671000	3677000	Alright. No, this was the game that Jason talked about in the intro, because this is too fucking good.
3677000	3689000	Pupparazzi. It is a game where you take pictures of dogs. Period. End of sentence. What the fuck else do I need to tell you?
3690000	3699000	It's poking up on Snap, but it's dogs. And it's going to be on Xbox Game Pass, so many of you are not going to have to pay an extra fee to play it.
3700000	3701000	It is awesome.
3702000	3709000	Not only do you take pictures of them, you play fetch with them, you pet them, and you just hang out with dogs.
3710000	3717000	And I love how they have no walking animations, any of them. That's the best part.
3718000	3720000	The graphics are a little bit of a throwback.
3720000	3721000	I love that.
3722000	3726000	Fifth Dream in chat says cat version instabyte. Look, and I am a cat person, you all know that.
3727000	3736000	I would be hard pressed to resist a good puppy game, or a good dog taking picture game. I love Nintendogs, even before they put cats in it.
3737000	3742000	Especially the fact it's on Game Pass. That's all I need. It's not going to cost me anything.
3743000	3747000	And the best part, the art style reminds me a bit of Katamari as well.
3747000	3748000	Kinda, yeah.
3749000	3752000	Or, you know, the original Pokemon Snap, but yeah.
3753000	3757000	Anyway, sj100matt wants to point out it's on Steam as well, if you want to check it out there.
3758000	3761000	Of course, Xbox Game Pass as well, so think about that.
3762000	3767000	Aragame 2 is coming out on Game Pass on September 17th. It's of course a sequel to Aragame.
3768000	3773000	It's a third person stealth game. I'm not big on stealth, but if you are, I bet this game will be up your alley.
3773000	3776000	You're an assassin, and all that good stuff. It's that type of game.
3777000	3782000	Evil Genius 2, World Domination. Guess what you do in that game?
3783000	3787000	You play a villain, and you are taking over the world, so have fun with that, Loki. It sounds like your kind of game.
3788000	3797000	Library of Ruina came out on the day of the press event, so that is also on Game Pass, if you want to check that out.
3797000	3808000	Pathfinder, Wrath of the Righteous, March 1st, 2022. That's a little ways out, but I think some people vary into these old school RPG type of games, and are going to be excited for that.
3809000	3817000	The Wandering Village. It is a city builder, but it's a city on the back of a creature. That's kind of interesting, a little twist on the usual formula.
3818000	3830000	Lab Rat, coming out on Xbox next year. It's kind of Portal, but more 2.5D than it is 3D. So those of you that get motion sick with your 3D games, should be a little easier to digest.
3831000	3842000	And, I love this because we were just fucking talking about this last week. RPG time. The Legend of Right. It's an RPG, but it's all inside a notebook.
3842000	3854000	Like a drawn type of thing. The graphics look really good. But then I also think about that. Loki, what was that fucking, it was the David Jaffe game that was all hand drawn, and came out on Playstation.
3855000	3857000	It flopped. Hard. Yeah.
3858000	3859000	Yeah, but that was different though.
3860000	3866000	No, it was different. It was different. So I hope this game finds successes where drawn to death, or whatever that was called, did not.
3867000	3868000	I think that's what it's called.
3869000	3872000	Maybe I'm thinking of just drawing to life, and that's a whole different game.
3873000	3875000	Maybe. I don't remember. Doesn't matter.
3876000	3887000	Inked. A Tale of Love. A very artistic type of game. Coming out on August 27th. You travel the world on paper with your partner, but then you kind of work with loss and things like that.
3888000	3896000	And there's a puzzle filled quest to gain things back. Interesting. Sounds very artsy, very plot driven. I'm into it.
3896000	3906000	The Big Con is another game coming out. A runaway teen who cons their way across America in the 90s, and it has the art style.
3907000	3908000	It looks like a 90s cartoon.
3909000	3911000	It looks like an episode of Doug. Yeah, I was going to say.
3912000	3913000	It looks cool. I like that.
3913000	3928000	The Veil, Shadow of the Crown. An audio only game. You play as a blind adventurer who has been made warden of a small castle on the outskirts of the kingdom. August 19th. Interesting.
3929000	3931000	This could be very interesting. I want to check this out.
3931000	3942000	Space Lines from the Far Out just got a demo released, and that was the last thing that they announced. So lots of good stuff at the end. This was a great week for indies.
3943000	3950000	The news was a little bit slower with the AAA stuff, but nothing short on the indie front, that's for sure.
3951000	3956000	Alright. Let's go to our next story. Logie?
3956000	3967000	Yeah, so this is kind of a follow up to the whole ROM universe thing. I think they had sued them not that long ago.
3968000	3975000	So now they're being ordered to destroy any of the ROMs that they have on their site.
3975000	3987000	And yeah, permanently destroy all unauthorized Nintendo games and otherwise unauthorized copies of Nintendo intellectual property, including movies, books, and music.
3988000	3992000	And they have until the 17th to do that.
3992000	4011000	Yeah, I guess it makes sense. I mean, since they were selling access to the site to actually gain access to these ROMs, which probably got them in more trouble than they would have if they were just offering up for free.
4011000	4016000	Yeah, it also strikes me as the type of thing where they're really trying to find loopholes to continue to get away with it.
4017000	4022000	And Nintendo is very much like, will you please shut it down, court, please?
4023000	4034000	Yeah, so they won the lawsuit against ROM universe in 2019. And it says that they were awarded $2.1 million in damages.
4035000	4041000	And it says, which would be paid by ROM universes owner Matthew Storman in $50 monthly payments.
4042000	4043000	Yeah, they're never gonna get that back.
4043000	4056000	So, but apparently, even even with the such a low amount being paid to Nintendo, which, honestly, for stealing a bunch of their property $50 a month doesn't sound that bad.
4057000	4066000	I mean, that some some of the combined price of all your streaming services might not even be that much.
4066000	4077000	But apparently, he had failed to make his first $50 payment back in July. So like, Nintendo was on his ass.
4078000	4089000	Yeah, that's like, that's like that whole, you're gonna make a $5 payment every month to settle the hospital bill that's which, without, you know, it shouldn't be a thing in this country, but I'm not going to go there tonight.
4090000	4095000	But it sounds very similar to that whole type of thing, the payment arrangement type of thing. So, hmm.
4096000	4104000	Anyway, moving on, this is your weekly reminder, there are still many issues going on at Activision Blizzard King.
4105000	4113000	And the employees, it's namely that the employees have written a letter that has not really gone responded to by the higher ups at Activision Blizzard.
4114000	4122000	So reminder that this issue is not over yet. And what has happened this week, though, is that there were more employees let go from the company.
4122000	4131000	Three high profile employees at Blizzard, no longer there. When I talk about high profile, I mean, one of them is Jesse McCree.
4132000	4136000	And you know, the character in Overwatch? Yeah, was named after this guy, so gone.
4137000	4150000	And even what's interesting now, some of the like, I was reading some stories on this, some of the commentators for the Overwatch type of gameplays and stuff are now calling that character the cowboy.
4150000	4156000	And they weren't directed to, they just did it out of their own, we think this is a good idea type of thing.
4157000	4163000	Like just started calling the character the cowboy, as opposed to his name in the game, which I think is very interesting.
4164000	4171000	Anyway, Luis Berrija, who was Diablo 4's game director, and Jesse McCree was the lead designer.
4172000	4176000	And then World of Warcraft designer Jonathan LaCraft, all let go from the company.
4176000	4186000	No reason was given for the departure? We can guess, I mean, that's what people are doing, because we have not been given reasons.
4187000	4196000	It was noted in a statement that there are new leaders in place where appropriate, and everything will be moving forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.
4197000	4208000	Mike Deft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, I know Overwatch League, I didn't know if it was Overwatch League commentators, or if it was another Overwatch thing.
4209000	4217000	Because Overwatch League isn't the only organized group of Overwatch sports on YouTube or Twitch that has commentating going on behind us.
4218000	4222000	I couldn't remember if it was specifically the OWL that was having that, or what was happening there.
4222000	4235000	Something of interesting note, two of these folks were in that infamous 2013 photo of the Cosby suite at Blizzcon, one of them front and center.
4236000	4243000	Just, again, we don't have an official reason why these folks were let go, but we're certainly reading the tea leaves, aren't we internet?
4243000	4265000	So, yes. Anyway, so that happened. I mean, assuming this, and I have to make an assumption, because of course they're not going to comment on the reasons, but assuming the timing and the lack of comment means it is tied to all this other investigation and stuff going on, then I say,
4265000	4272000	Buh-bye. Don't let the door hit ya. Yep. Cleaning house, says DJ Romas. Yep, yep.
4273000	4284000	Questbuster points out that McCree's name was also a part of the chat log that was screenshotted about the Cosby suite. I'm gonna give that five yikes out of five. Alright.
4285000	4299000	Alright, let's go back to a simpler time in gaming with our next segment, which is brought to us in a prior recorded segment earlier today from the one and only DarkSakura, who is not with us here tonight, because again, if you're just getting here, she is out sick.
4300000	4309000	So her voice, she didn't think would hold out for a couple of hours tonight during the show, but she did put together this about ten minute segment for you guys, and I'm sure you all know what time it is.
4310000	4328000	The classic game of the week is Baldur's Gate, which came out for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS on December 21st, 1998 for PC and July 31st, 2000 for Mac OS.
4328000	4338000	It is a fantasy role playing game that was developed by BioWare and published by Interplay Entertainment, and it is the first in the Baldur's Gate series.
4339000	4354000	It takes place in Forgotten Realms, which is one of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons second edition sets. They're actually using modified versions of the rules from the rulebook for that game.
4355000	4371000	It was also the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, and then Interplay has used that for other Forgotten Realms licensed games, including the Icewind Dale and some of the other games like Planescape Torment.
4371000	4394000	At any rate, you make your own protagonist, and you have to go across the Sword Coast with a party of companions to see why this iron crisis is affecting the area, and then you have to see who's behind it and look for dark secrets and stuff like that.
4394000	4415000	As far as how it plays, how it looks, you start with a top-down, isometric, third-person perspective. You go through pre-rendered locations, you have quests, you recruit your companions, and it's very much like playing tabletop D&D.
4416000	4423000	You do have, of course, the advantage of keyboard shortcuts and whatnot, using your mouse, etc.
4423000	4452000	And like I said before, it uses the modified version of the second edition D&D rules, including looking at your statistics, your dice rolling, and you do play, of course, in real-time, but some of the elements in the rule sets were modified to feature a pause real-time mode where you could just sort of stop the play right there.
4453000	4480000	When you start a new playthrough, you can actually bring in your old character or create a new one. You have different points in combat. You have to determine your name, gender, race, class, alignment, your ability scores, weapon proficiencies, things like that, just like when you're starting an original AD&D game for second edition.
4480000	4494000	You can do multi-classes, but it still follows those rules. For example, if you're a fighter and a cleric, you can only use the cleric's weapons. It's kind of like that.
4494000	4507000	So it's an eight-part game. You have a prologue and seven chapters, and you have to do different tasks to complete it. You get experience points, you level up. It is like playing tabletop D&D, just as a video game.
4510000	4525000	The inventory in there is what's referred to as sort of like a paper doll mechanic that you equip items, depending on what type they are, weapons, ammos, armor, helmet, necklace, rings, belt, cloak, feet, and usable items.
4525000	4534000	So it does affect your weight limit, which affects your strength score, which affects your rolls. I mean, it is very, very second edition D&D.
4534000	4547000	You can converse with NPCs, non-playable characters, and you actually have meters with them that give you those various options.
4547000	4563000	Other features that will affect the gameplay is customizing your player character after creation, changing your primary and minor colors for the character, switching on and off the game AI.
4563000	4578000	Different locations will have different dynamics based on what you do, like fog or actually casting fog of war will do something. You have different things like that.
4578000	4592000	You have in-game changes that you can keep up with character fatigue. If you spend a whole day traveling, then your fatigue is going to affect you or else you have to rest.
4592000	4606000	So in other things like that, like I said, it's set in the Forgotten Realms settings in 1368 DR in the midst of an iron shortage.
4606000	4623000	It brings in some many things from the Forgotten Realms playbooks, such as the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Iron Throne, the Flaming Fist, the Chill, the Black Talons, and the Harpers.
4623000	4640000	You can have about 25 players who can join your PC, and there are some who are official Forgotten Realms canon, including Dritz Dorden and Elminster. If you don't know who they are, then you are not old school D&D.
4640000	4655000	At any rate, it began development in 1995 by BioWare in Canada. It was just called Forgotten Realms, and it was going to be based in general on Forgotten Realms.
4655000	4671000	They just kept working on it. With this, what was new about it is that instead of building the game from tiles like previous ones have, the characters are individually rendered.
4671000	4697000	It took a lot of time to develop the game for the technology at that time. The 60 people team had basically never participated in any kind of video game release, so they just kept the design simple so that they could keep their ship date in mind.
4701000	4714000	As far as the sales go, Baldur's Gate did have very low sales. In Britain, at least, they said that they projected zero sales.
4714000	4734000	As far as the retail shippers, as of December 21st, it began to sell at a phenomenal rate. The first run of 50,000 copies sold out immediately, and they had Interplay working hard on getting more copies published.
4734000	4753000	In the US, it remained in PC Data's weekly top three from January 10th to February 6th, and claimed number one for January, with sales of 80,500 copies and revenues of $3.6 million in the US alone.
4753000	4763000	There were shortages of the game. It was in very, very high demand, and it maintained its unbroken streak in the top 10 through May 27th for that magazine.
4763000	4776000	It popped off the list for a little bit, and then it came right back. And then, of course, there was the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. It put it right back up on the list.
4776000	4794000	So, with the game having continuously sold well into, like, 2003 and later, yeah, it's one of those games that, even if you haven't played it, you probably know about it.
4794000	4804000	Some of the gameplay in it was compared to the first Diablo, but of course it had a more extensive selection of different options, different features.
4804000	4813000	But they didn't care for the pixel-based characters, but they loved the rendered backgrounds, and they said that it was beautiful.
4814000	4829000	It was named the best computer role-playing game of 1998 by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, and several other magazines. Plenty of them.
4829000	4838000	And computer games, RPG Vault, a few others basically presented at their Game of the Year awards.
4838000	4854000	As far as its legacy is concerned, it really revived the RPG genre, as in, like, the Western style. And it basically brought, to quote John Harris of Gamasutra, it rescued computer D&D from the wastebasket.
4855000	4870000	It was the first, like I said, in the Baldur's Gate series. It had an expansion called Tales of the Sword Coast in 1999, and then Baldur's Gate 2 Shadow of Amn in 2000, its expansion Throne of Baal in 2001.
4871000	4886000	And then of course there were other games by BioWare and Black Isle Studios, Planescape Torment, Icewind Dale, Icewind Dale 2. There was a Baldur's Gate novel that Philip Athens wrote in 1999 based on the game.
4886000	4898000	It was re-released as a Baldur's Gate double pack with expansions and whatnot, and then there were multi-game expansions later on.
4898000	4917000	It was released on GOG in 2010, so it's available via GameStop app as part of the D&D anthology, The Master Collection, which has pretty much a bunch of the Icewind Dale Planescapes.
4917000	4923000	The Temple of Elemental Evil, which I've actually played that as a desktop game.
4923000	4930000	Then in 2012 there was a remake Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition that was supposed to be out Summer 2012.
4930000	4936000	And then they also said that that was going to be released for iPad.
4937000	4944000	And then it kept getting delayed, and then finally it was launched for Windows November 20, 2012.
4944000	4954000	iPads running iOS 6 or greater on December 7, 2012, and Mac OS X February 22, 2013, Android April 17, 2014.
4954000	4958000	And apparently Baldur's Gate 3 is in development by Larian Studios.
4959000	4968000	And then Skybound Games brought the Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition to PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 15, 2019.
4968000	4978000	So we're still seeing fairly recent releases of Baldur's Gate. It's really one of those, I would say, iconic PC games.
4978000	4983000	Like I said, if you haven't played it, you should still at least have known about it.
4984000	4990000	And so that's the classic game, now that I'm starting to sound like frog.
4990000	4996000	So again, check it out. You've got options, recent options, that will allow you to play that game.
4996000	5004000	And if you have good memories of it or want more questions about it, feel free to email us at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5004000	5008000	so that I can read your email and we'll talk about it.
5008000	5011000	In the interim, stay classic.
5011000	5018000	All right, there it is, the classic game of the week. Thank you, Dark Soccer, for that segment. Baldur's Gate is the game of the week.
5018000	5023000	She's not here live in studio for us to really talk about it further, but I'll have to bug her about it next week.
5023000	5028000	That is really an all-time computing classic. And yeah, it's still getting all sorts of recent releases there.
5028000	5031000	She kind of called out at the end there, so very nice.
5031000	5036000	All right, let's get back into some more news. We're going to do some rapid-fire news, in fact.
5036000	5040000	So, Loki, why don't you take us around some other headlines pretty quick?
5040000	5050000	Yes, so Idris Elba has teased that he is going to be voicing the character Knuckles in the brand new Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
5050000	5054000	So, that'll be coming soon.
5054000	5067000	Honestly, he tweeted out a picture of Knuckles' hand and saying, you know, knock, knock, which someone said is from Sonic Adventures.
5067000	5073000	I thought it was a reference to Kung Fury because they make a joke, you know, knock, knock, who's there?
5073000	5077000	Knuckles, you know, I thought that was a reference there.
5077000	5081000	But apparently, no, I was reading too far into that, but that's pretty cool.
5081000	5084000	So, we'll see that come out next year.
5085000	5097000	And then also, apparently, there was an exploit that Valve has now patched that allowed you to get infinite Steam wallet money.
5097000	5107000	And apparently, a security researcher on HackerOne recently submitted an exploit that could be used on Steam to gain unlimited funds.
5107000	5114000	It has since been patched and they have rewarded the person who found this with $7,500.
5114000	5120000	Tells me they probably have gotten a lot more Steam wallet money than the $7,500.
5120000	5124000	But yes, so that was thanks to Dr. Bricks.
5124000	5129000	I'm curious to see how that worked out.
5129000	5134000	But it's something that had to do with like different payment systems and email addresses.
5134000	5137000	Yeah, using the smart to pay payment method.
5137000	5140000	So, neat.
5140000	5149000	All right. We are looking at Arcade Archives, which is a very robust release of classic arcade games on the Switch.
5149000	5152000	It's basically MAME, but legal, right?
5152000	5157000	You know, and they have a lot of nice options so you can kind of emulate the game in different ways.
5157000	5161000	And they've got, I think they celebrated over 100 games in that series not that long ago.
5161000	5163000	And now we know the next one coming out.
5163000	5164000	And it just came out this past week.
5164000	5172000	Actually, it's Curry Kinton is out this week, which is a martial art game that came out from Taito in 1988.
5172000	5175000	It's available now on Switch and PS4 for $8.
5175000	5177000	So enjoy that.
5177000	5185000	Also, I thought this was funny because this was observed by our own Dark Tetsuya who sometimes feeds us stories to talk about on the show.
5185000	5195000	And I thought this was worth bringing up is that there is a comprehensive list out there on Twitter that was put together by this user partytimehxlnt.
5195000	5196000	Excellent.
5196000	5200000	Oh, I get it. Partytimehxlnt. I get that. Okay, guys, got it.
5200000	5205000	Who put together a list of new homebrew games for classic consoles.
5205000	5208000	And it's a list that's available on itch.io so you can actually see,
5208000	5214000	oh, here's a bunch of itch.io games that are like made for old console hardware like a Sega Master System or an NES.
5214000	5219000	And guess what? Pixel Poops number two made the list.
5219000	5220000	Good for you, Loki.
5220000	5221000	Yeah.
5221000	5223000	You're getting recognized.
5223000	5225000	Getting some recognition out there.
5225000	5227000	Love that.
5227000	5228000	All right.
5228000	5230000	And yes, that was news I felt like reporting on.
5230000	5231000	What can I say?
5231000	5232000	It was a slow week.
5232000	5237000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5237000	5240000	This is where people are going to scream conflict of interest, ethics.
5240000	5243000	Look, we have none of this.
5243000	5245000	Yeah. First off, we have none of this.
5245000	5248000	Second off, you know what?
5248000	5249000	Loki worked very hard on that game.
5249000	5253000	If we're going to cheap shill it, we're going to keep shilling it until more you buy it.
5253000	5256000	That's the way it's going to be.
5256000	5258000	All right.
5258000	5260000	Let's get into some release dates.
5260000	5262000	Let's check out some games that aren't Pixel Poops.
5262000	5265000	I don't know why you'd play them, but they're out on other systems this week.
5265000	5266000	Loki.
5266000	5270000	Yeah, we've got Road 96 out on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5270000	5274000	Humankind on PC, Mac and Stadia.
5274000	5282000	12 Minutes, which is that time loop game that's going to be coming out on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
5282000	5283000	Oh, play that.
5283000	5288000	Recompile on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
5288000	5295000	Rims Racing on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
5295000	5304000	Yoni on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
5304000	5310000	And we've got Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5310000	5319000	And last but not least, Madden NFL 22 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Stadia.
5319000	5321000	It's just the game from a couple of years ago.
5321000	5325000	So I don't know why you bother, but it's out this week.
5325000	5326000	Again.
5326000	5329000	Roster Update 22.
5329000	5330000	Right.
5330000	5333000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
5333000	5337000	On the Nintendo Switch this week, we have Amnesia World for Nintendo Switch.
5337000	5340000	I'd tell you more about this game, but I forgot.
5340000	5342000	We also have coming out on the Nintendo...
5342000	5346000	Okay, it's a bad joke. Dad joke.
5346000	5353000	The protagonist wakes up and discovers that they lost all their memory and they have no idea who they are, what was going on.
5353000	5356000	And so they obviously have to go piece all that together.
5356000	5360000	It looks a little bit like one of those manga turned into a video game.
5360000	5362000	In fact, it probably is exactly what it is.
5362000	5364000	But that is out on the Switch this week.
5364000	5367000	We also have Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis Cloud.
5367000	5371000	That's kind of neat because that's one of those Switch releases in Japan where it runs off the cloud.
5371000	5375000	We only got, like, Control did that here, right?
5375000	5378000	Did we get, like, a Switch Control release that was cloud-based or something?
5378000	5382000	Yeah. We don't see a lot of those here, but there's more of them in Japan.
5382000	5386000	And so Phantasy Star Online 2 is one of them there.
5386000	5391000	You won't see that here, I'm sure, because I think Microsoft has some type of deal on the Phantasy Star Online 2 front.
5391000	5393000	So something to keep in mind.
5393000	5400000	However, going over to the PlayStation 5, you can get Yuoni this week is out in Japan on the 19th.
5400000	5404000	And I'm trying to see what this game is all about.
5404000	5406000	It looks like a scary game.
5406000	5415000	Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide-and-seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world.
5415000	5417000	So it's Dead by Daylight.
5417000	5426000	Okay, it's not Dead by Daylight, but it has the same type of, like, hide-and-seek-or-die type of plot going on with this game.
5426000	5428000	We like scary games. That might be fun.
5428000	5430000	All right, there's your releases in Japan.
5430000	5432000	Are you able to do UK for me, Loki?
5432000	5433000	Yep.
5433000	5434000	Cool.
5434000	5444000	So in the UK, we've got, looks like Greek Memoirs of Azur on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
5444000	5448000	We have Humankind on PC.
5448000	5452000	Rims Racing looks like coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.
5452000	5457000	Ghosts of Tsushima, Director's Cut on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5457000	5461000	Seven Days to Die on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.
5461000	5466000	Madden NFL 22 on all of the platforms.
5466000	5470000	And that's it.
5470000	5471000	All right.
5471000	5476000	We're going to do a few more stories, and then we'll open it up for the roundtable and see if you guys want to call in.
5476000	5477000	We'll do calls tonight if you want.
5477000	5480000	Head on over to the green room if that sounds like something you want to do.
5480000	5484000	And we can also talk about whatever other topics you might want to bring up in chat.
5484000	5489000	And I will also check the mailbag, although I think it was empty last I looked.
5489000	5490000	But I'll look.
5490000	5493000	Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the place to send an email.
5493000	5495000	Let's do some more news though, Loki.
5495000	5496000	Yeah.
5496000	5509000	So a group of senators have actually sent out some letters to big names in the game publishing industry in the US to try to get them to voluntarily adopt rules that are going to be implemented in the UK soon,
5509000	5517000	designed to protect children from exploitative practices and video games regarding loot boxes.
5517000	5523000	So I think this is the issue where they have like kind of the odds and stuff like that.
5523000	5542000	So apparently, this has gone out to Epic, Activision, Disney and Microsoft asking that they extend the UK's new age appropriate design code, the AADC regulation to American children in order to protect them from loot box gambling and microtransactions.
5542000	5543000	They won't.
5543000	5550000	And although they, I don't know, I don't think anything's going to come in.
5550000	5552000	They're not going to do it until you force them to do it.
5552000	5556000	So yeah, ain't going to happen.
5556000	5563000	It says the new law, the regulations set standards across 15 categories.
5563000	5572000	It focuses on high privacy by default, not sharing children's data and keeping geolocation off by default as well.
5573000	5584000	Yeah, I just I don't see them implementing this in the US because basically they make money off of people.
5584000	5598000	Well, I see some elements of it, you know, and this is this is the whole reason why we were kind of warning the gaming industry a long time ago about if you don't come up with a way to self-regulate yourself, the government's going to step in and do it for you and you're not going to like what they come up with.
5598000	5602000	Because and the subtext there is the government's not going to get it.
5602000	5613000	They're not going to understand. They're going to show that they're out of touch. And the fact that, you know, you don't really have a lot of, you know, you don't have a good mix of generations in public.
5613000	5618000	You know what I mean? How many zoomers and millennials are in public office all the way in Washington?
5618000	5621000	There's a handful of millennials, but not enough.
5621000	5624000	There's too many people that don't understand this industry making these.
5624000	5641000	That's that's why when the Supreme Court ruled on Schwarzenegger and the ESA or whatever that was years ago that I was shocked that they actually were calling out things like Mortal Kombat and stuff in the decisions, although I'm sure their legal staff to fill them in on that.
5641000	5648000	But it just goes to show that, like people more in touch with games are a little clued into like what's going to work and what's not going to work.
5648000	5656000	And, you know, it just it just seems like there's stuff in this that is very out of touch. And I hope they fix it up.
5656000	5665000	Yeah. And I and honestly, I think like with the it's it's nice to think of the children and stuff in as far as exploiting them with loot boxes.
5665000	5668000	But at the same time, like.
5668000	5670000	Children don't really have money.
5670000	5684000	It's the parents that do and assuming that, you know, I and I know there's some cases where children have like access to like the parents put their card in to the system and like save my information to make it easier to make payments later.
5684000	5686000	And the kid can rack up, you know, stuff like that.
5686000	5690000	But I don't think that those are necessarily as common as you might think.
5690000	5701000	I think if anything, it's more folks that have kind of the gambling compulsion and whatnot that feel they basically are encouraged to buy.
5701000	5712000	And those folks are adults. And at the same time, though, I think that we should just be removing the whole, you know, kind of gambling aspect out of these games when it comes to loot boxes anyways.
5712000	5718000	More so for the adults who might be susceptible to that, because that's where a lot of this money is coming from.
5718000	5732000	I don't think kids are necessarily buying a ton of stuff. Now, that said, though, like my son, for example, got about 150 bucks worth of Roblox, Robux, and it like dumped that immediately, like just spent it all.
5732000	5745000	So like, I get it that like, you know, they kids aren't the best in like being able to manage money, but they're only managing the money that you give them.
5745000	5751000	And assuming that you're not an idiot that puts your payment information saves it to, you know, your console.
5751000	5759000	And, you know, assuming that it's not like a child stealing a credit card or something like that to pay for stuff, which I'm sure there's situations where that happens.
5759000	5764000	But like, I think for the most part, it doesn't like that.
5764000	5773000	I just still think it's a bad idea all around. And so, you know, sure, let's focus on making rules for children to protect them, but like.
5773000	5782000	I don't think that they really need a lot of protecting when it comes to this kind of stuff. I think it's more of like maybe curvy and habits for like in the future.
5782000	5789000	Well, I think the transparency on the odds and like what is actually in the loot boxes and all that, that's fine. I don't have a problem with that for sure.
5789000	5794000	I think there is a lot of predatory behavior from the game companies on this, but when they start to kind of.
5794000	5801000	I felt like, especially from some of the interpretations of this, they were kind of like sneaking these other things in there about like video games are too violent.
5801000	5806000	It was like somewhere in there and it was like, well, that's that's not the discussion.
5806000	5812000	Yeah, movie. What about movies are too violent? What about books are too violent? What about art is too violent?
5812000	5819000	What about, you know, you go see those, you know, classic pieces from ancient Greece of the person carrying around the decapitated head.
5819000	5823000	That's kind of violent if you think about it. Like art sometimes reflects violence.
5823000	5828000	And I'm just sick of the gaming industry continuously getting shit on for it.
5828000	5836000	And I guess just the gaming industry right now, like it'll be like if VR takes off, like it's, you know, someday or whatever, they'll blame that.
5836000	5841000	They'll be like, it's so immersive. There's killing simulators out there. And like, it'll get ridiculous.
5841000	5846000	I'm sure. Just mark my words. Ten years. That'll definitely happen.
5846000	5853000	But like, it's just they blame anybody because they don't mean look at the how many mass shootings do we have?
5853000	5858000	And they always blame everything other than gun regulation. Oh, let's blame media.
5858000	5867000	Let's blame, you know, they saw people getting angry in the street. So, you know, they took offense like they will blame anybody because why?
5867000	5874000	The gun lobbies pay them to have that kind of opinion. They throw all they care about is money.
5874000	5881000	And that's all these companies care about is money. So they're going to do everything they can to ensure that they're getting tons of loot boxes.
5881000	5889000	If that means like taking loot boxes out of, you know, certain types of games that may appeal more to children, then sure.
5889000	5894000	But like, I think for like, you know, FIFA Ultimate Team and stuff like that, like they're making a ton of money.
5894000	5899000	And I don't know who's buying those. I mean, some people are probably buying them just to play the game.
5899000	5903000	But like, I feel that some people might have a compulsion to buy them as well.
5903000	5910000	Like whether they're just like so, you know, competitive that they feel that they need to do this to stay competitive.
5910000	5917000	It just might kind of justify it to themselves as, well, this is what I have to do to be competitive in this game. Like, I don't know.
5917000	5923000	Like Pokemon Unite? You're talking about the generational gap and all that stuff.
5923000	5932000	And since you brought up VR, it just made me think of this thing where it's like, you know, sometimes I will still see things on the news or reports and things like that that will bring up VR and talk about VR.
5932000	5940000	And then show footage of the lawnmower man. That is exactly how you can tell that the person that is, you know, reporting on this doesn't fucking know a thing about VR.
5940000	5950000	Because they still associate it with a not even good movie from the 90s, because that was pop culture's first kind of VR thing in the mainstream.
5950000	5959000	So seriously, look for it. Look for it. Look for one of these news channels, your local news talking about VR, and then they'll show a clip from the lawnmower man.
5959000	5969000	And that is how you instantly know the person who put this together doesn't know dick about VR. Or tits, whatever. They don't know anything about anything when it comes to VR.
5969000	5971000	Oh, that's hilarious.
5971000	5972000	Am I wrong, though?
5972000	5974000	Maybe they're just trolling.
5974000	5988000	No, it's like, it's like, it's their system with archive footage and they go into a VR footage archive and there's always, like, number one result, lawnmower man, it's like an internal Google thing they all use to find the stock footage.
5989000	5995000	I hope someday they cover lawn mowing and actually show the lawnmower man for that too. That'd be hilarious.
5995000	6007000	Questbuster in chat says it reminds me of when someone from Britain exercising their right to request their personal information from a company like EA was shocked to learn how much they spent on FIFA Ultimate Team.
6007000	6012000	They spent a little here and there, but the record showed just how much in total they spent and it floored them.
6012000	6026000	Oh, if I ever had my records pulled on, like, how much money I'd given Niantic, I'll cry. I will full on man cry. Like, just because I'm sure it's in the four digits at this point. It's got to be.
6026000	6038000	It's got to be between Pokemon Go and Ingress across. How long have I been playing Ingress? Too fucking long. Like at least five years, if not more. I'm sure I've spent now in the four number of digits.
6039000	6045000	No, fuck. Pokemon Go just turned five. So Ingress, I've probably been playing for like seven or eight. Jesus.
6047000	6061000	Anyway, uh, yeah. And here's another fun game you can play. If you're an MMO player, here's a dare. I'm going to double dog dare you to do something. Okay, so fifth dream in chat says if I knew how much I spent on Final Fantasy 14. Yikes.
6061000	6076000	All right, here we go. Fifth dream. I'm going to double dog dare you. Log into Final Fantasy 14 and I want you to type slash played. It might be slash playtime in that game, but try both until it works.
6076000	6086000	And it's actually going to show you how many hours of your life you've spent playing that game. Fifth dream says, oh, I did that before.
6086000	6093000	I think we've all probably done it once and then had a moment where we were like, oh, fuck. Oh, my God. Really?
6096000	6109000	Yeah. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says EQ had slash played. It even converted it to days. Oh, so does. Wow, we'll do this too. Final Fantasy 14 does it and it'll convert it to days in both as well.
6110000	6120000	So dark to see you says, does that work on PlayStation four? Yes. You just have to either type it in like you're going to type a chat message or use your use your keyboard attachment.
6120000	6129000	But you're you're literally playing the exact same thing because you can even have a keyboard interface on the PlayStation four if you hook up a keyboard mouse like I did once.
6129000	6139000	So. All right. No one special in chat says with all the money I spent on Steam and GOG, I could have bought a brand new car. Yep. Yep. Very that.
6139000	6152000	Where was the comment on Lawnmower Man? Because it was funny. I wanted to read it. Let's see. Oh, SG100Matt says Lawnmower Man is probably free to use and they've kept the stock video they've kept around since the 1990s.
6152000	6163000	Yep. Hey, SheHulk10, I appreciate the positive outlook. SheHulk10 is here with the positive outlook on the slash played that says it shows you that you got your money's worth.
6163000	6173000	That's that's a much better outlook than look how much of your life you've wasted playing this bullshit.
6174000	6186000	You did. You got your money's worth. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about Castlevania and a Castlevania game that is coming to Apple Arcade. But don't get too excited. It's not exactly what you think.
6186000	6198000	But I mean, it looks pretty. It's a Castlevania game that's coming out for Apple Arcade, but it's a grimoire of souls. It'll be out on iOS, tvOS and Mac. You know, same places that something like Fantation is out.
6198000	6210000	This game was originally announced by Konami in 2018 and then it soft launched on iOS and then they removed it from the App Store last year, probably because they had this deal going in place instead.
6210000	6224000	So this is going to come out. And yeah, they're going to have some classic designs from Castlevania veterans and a lot of familiar playable characters as well.
6224000	6236000	You fight your way through Dracula's armies and then there's a co-op and bounty hunt mode. And I probably won't play it. Let's be real. It's just it's not Symphony of the Night or anything like it.
6236000	6242000	It's not even close to being one of the DS games or anything like that. So that's true.
6242000	6257000	That's true. SJ100Matt says Jamie will probably get it. And yeah, I mean, to be fair, she's talked about she plays Fantation. She has Apple Arcade. She probably will. It's like Xbox Game Pass. There's some things I will only play because, oh hey, it's on Game Pass. Why not?
6257000	6270000	I'm not at that point where I have Apple Arcade yet. I will probably get it eventually, but I just haven't got it yet. So, alright. Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys. Loki.
6270000	6283000	So No Man's Sky is celebrating their fifth anniversary and along with a cool kind of look back trailer, kind of cataloging all the different updates that they've done to the game.
6283000	6291000	They also announced that they're going to be releasing yet another free update, which is apparently is the 17th update called Frontiers.
6291000	6304000	And it is coming out at some point soon. And they said that it's basically going to add a missing piece of the sci-fi fantasy that we always wanted to add. And it's very fitting for our fifth anniversary.
6304000	6313000	So no word exactly on what it's going to be, but I mean, they've been supporting this game like crazy. So definitely go check it out.
6313000	6321000	Yeah, I'm excited. I wish they would date the expansion because that also means they haven't done an expedition since that Mass Effect one.
6321000	6327000	And I thought it would be like Diablo Seasons where there was always kind of one going on with maybe a couple week break. We haven't had an expedition in months.
6327000	6336000	So, which it's fine. It's not. Look, that game has given us a lot. I'm not upset about it, but I'm very excited to see the next expansion. Yes.
6336000	6343000	Got another game that just turned five, right? So, yeah, that's that's awesome. You know, I love me some No Man's Sky.
6343000	6349000	I'll be streaming it. If there's another expedition, I'll absolutely stream it and be checking out whatever this expansion is.
6349000	6357000	I wonder, I wonder what it could be. It sounds like it's almost like another base building type of thing, but I could really be anything.
6357000	6361000	But at some point, you would think they're going to have to stop and start making a new game.
6361000	6367000	I mean, they probably are already working on a new game, but you would think they would want those resources. I don't know.
6367000	6384000	Anyway. All right. Something much older than five years old, but is just now going to be hitting the indie little retro throwback craze is the Amiga 500 mini.
6385000	6393000	I say indie because there's smaller companies that are doing these things. It is going to be very similar to the C64 mini because it's the same company doing it.
6393000	6402000	Retro Games. It is a reimagining of the Commodore Amiga. It will have the emulation of the original A500 chipset and the AGA.
6402000	6410000	That's the advanced graphics architecture of the A1200, the later Amiga. The A500 mini will come with a mouse and a gamepad.
6410000	6416000	And you can also plug in a standard keyboard over USB. So it will not be like that.
6416000	6422000	So there was a C64 mini that was very similar. And then they actually put out the C64 that was full size.
6422000	6429000	This Amiga thing isn't full size, but damn, that mouse looks legit. Like that is exactly what the Amiga mice look like.
6430000	6440000	25 games included, including Pinball Dreams, which I think is the must-have Amiga title in there.
6440000	6442000	But there's actually some really good shit in here.
6442000	6451000	ATR All-Terrain Racing, Battle Chess, Simon the Sorcerer, Worms the Director's Cut, Zool, Ninja of the Nth Dimension. Rad.
6451000	6455000	And that's just a little bit of the list. So that's pretty cool.
6455000	6462000	Of course you have save, resume functionality, 50 hertz and 60 hertz screen refresh options, CRT filter, blah blah blah.
6462000	6468000	What's it going to cost? $139 in US money, or 129 euros if you want to go that way.
6468000	6474000	So yeah, that's awesome. Due out in early 2022, so it doesn't look like it's going to make the holiday.
6474000	6478000	And I imagine all the computer part shortages probably play into that a little bit.
6478000	6484000	She-Hulk says, yeah, Commodore, it ruled the 80s. Sure, that was where I started gaming.
6484000	6495000	I mean, I guess technically I played an Atari 2600 before the Commodore, but I put way more hours in Commodore 64 than I did anything else between the ages of around 5 and probably 10, to be honest.
6495000	6500000	So Dartusy in chat says, I figured Rob would appreciate this being the Commodore computer fan. Hell yeah.
6500000	6505000	We never had an Amiga, but I certainly respect and know the system, that's for sure.
6505000	6509000	And I was always jealous of my friends that had them, but they were really expensive computers.
6509000	6516000	The Amiga was really expensive at its time. So there's that whole problem.
6516000	6523000	All right, let's get to our listener roundtable. If you would like to give us a call or you could join our green room on Discord.
6523000	6527000	Also, if you would like to send us in a chat question, you can do that as well.
6527000	6533000	And we'll get some of those. And then I would go to the mailbag, but we don't have any emails tonight.
6533000	6537000	So participate at orangelaunchradio.com if you'd like to send us an email for a future week.
6537000	6548000	Questbuster wants to point out on the No Man's Sky thing, Hello Games is working on a new big project, but they haven't said what it is, only that it's going to be as ambitious as No Man's Sky.
6548000	6557000	You know, it's hard to hear that and not think they're making another space game, because what is more vast than space? Really nothing.
6557000	6566000	But I'm curious to see maybe what they might put their random procedural generator thing that powered a game like No Man's Sky, what they might put that on.
6566000	6573000	Could they make an RPG out of that? Or what it is they're going to do? Could they do a game about exploring the oceans?
6573000	6578000	There's so much unknown when it comes to that. I don't know. I mean, there's just a lot of question mark there.
6578000	6586000	It could be literally anything until No Man's Sky, until Hello Games, the makers of No Man's Sky say something about it. That's for sure.
6587000	6595000	Dark Tetsuya in chat, did anyone get to check out the Windjammers 2 beta? I'm kind of hooked and I even got my wife into it. A big no for me, sadly.
6595000	6604000	No, I didn't. But to be fair, I didn't play any betas, just Hades. I didn't play Diablo either this weekend. Did you play Windjammers 2 yet, Loki?
6604000	6606000	No, I have not.
6607000	6617000	Well, hopefully soon. Hopefully soon. I didn't talk earlier in the show about Pokemon Go, but the community day happened this weekend.
6617000	6627000	And I gotta say, for as many hours as they gave it, between the heatwave here and Hades and my general, like, do I really need to get more EVs?
6627000	6637000	I didn't really play a lot. I caught a bunch of stuff on the house, and I ended up getting a 3-star EV because I got one that showed up.
6637000	6645000	So, maybe it hatched. I don't remember. But anyway, I got one and I was happy enough with that.
6646000	6654000	And I've been sitting on some shinies, too. So I made a new Glaceon and a new Sylveon. I still need to make a Leafeon before the time's up.
6654000	6661000	Because I guess you can still do that until Monday morning. Mike Def says, 29 between the two days. Holy crap, that's a lot.
6661000	6669000	I didn't ask Shane how many he got, but I'm just assuming he didn't care about it as much because it was EV reset. Oh, Shane's in chat. How about that?
6669000	6680000	I'm too physical. Shane, how many shinies did you get in EV weekend? Or did you care? You were out doing errands.
6680000	6688000	Shane in chat also says, I'm two physical copies away from having all the Hades versions. I'll probably finish that off within the next month or two.
6688000	6696000	And y'all tease me about Mass Effect 3. But there's always those games. There's always those games that are just gonna do it for you.
6696000	6704000	Yeah, Carlos points out in chat, thank you, 1 p.m. Eastern, so 10 a.m. for me, to make my shiny Leafeon, which I have plenty of EVs to do that with.
6704000	6717000	So, uh, Jesus. Shane in chat says, I opened my game today during a run to Walmart and got 11? I maybe got four, but I really didn't play a lot.
6718000	6730000	Four on my house is still kind of a lot. I don't know. Let's see, Carlos in chat says, my Pogo group didn't care, but only went out for Hundo notifications.
6730000	6743000	Oh, that's clever. Yeah, I know a lot of people were very meh on the fact it was a repeat weekend anyway, and then you add on top of that just the fact that Pokemon Go kind of pissed off its player fan base within the past month.
6743000	6752000	There's a lot of people that are like, I'm not buying that 99 cent ticket, even though I kind of think what they were offering as far as like the rewards and stuff were probably better than they have in a while.
6752000	6763000	The fact that you can get one free Eevee Lucian that's guaranteed to at least be a two star that has the special move with it, you just get it from doing that quest.
6763000	6769000	And then they also had what like incubators and maybe an egg like it's probably one of the better deals for the 99 cent quest they've done.
6769000	6779000	But there's a lot of people that are just like, keep it. Because they're mad and they're sticking to their guns. But that's what you have to do. If you're really upset about it, you got to vote with your wallet.
6779000	6788000	And so it'll be interesting to see how many people did that on a big scale because Pokemon Go is an international game. So we'll have to see how that goes.
6789000	6793000	Oh, Mike Deff says I had the Go Plus running. Gotcha.
6793000	6798000	S200Matt says I work Saturday and Sunday. So maybe I got 15 since I had to play at home for some of it.
6798000	6807000	Didn't get a damn shiny Heracross. Been trying. Yeah, I wanted a shiny Heracross too. I did a lot of those. I still didn't get a shiny unknown.
6807000	6815000	I did like 15 unknown raids probably. I did a lot and still didn't get a shiny one of those. I'm pissed. But it is what it is.
6816000	6825000	All right. I don't see anyone in the green room. Any other just last call for questions or chat topics and then we will move on.
6825000	6832000	Shane in chat says I didn't get the ticket. I will for Oshawa day, whatever that is. But I think that's the end of Go for me at that point.
6832000	6843000	I'm also curious. There's I we know there's a Pokemon announcement thing coming on what the 18th? Is that Wednesday, Thursday? It's coming up pretty soon.
6843000	6849000	And we're supposed to get not just the Gen 4 remake details, which I know Shane, you in particular Luke warm on.
6849000	6855000	But Pokemon are say our Saris is supposed to be the legends, whatever that is supposed to get more information as well.
6855000	6860000	And I imagine you're a lot more interested in that one. So, yeah, Wednesday. So hyped. Yeah.
6860000	6866000	Carlos says I said keep it to the 99 cent easy quest because there was no incentive to do it when we have enough of these.
6866000	6872000	They brought back the same moves. So we had no motivation. There you go.
6872000	6878000	Yeah, I'm I'm gonna be very curious with the announce of the Pokemon thing, too. I'm I'm curious about a Gen 4 remake.
6878000	6887000	I'll play it, especially if it ends up tying into Pokemon Bank and all that, like I want to finish my decks and bank and all that good stuff, which, you know, I'm a little behind when it comes to that stuff.
6887000	6895000	So and if I guess also it's one of those things where like platinum was better than Diamond and Pearl.
6895000	6901000	So maybe if some of those quality of life things are in it, it might not be so bad, but we'll see.
6901000	6910000	As Joe and Matt also points out, we get the catch up days in December to reduce some of the shiny catches of the year. Yes, that is very true. Very, very true.
6910000	6918000	All right. Let's get into any last minute stories. Loki, I don't know if you have any of those. I think we might have burned through them all.
6918000	6927000	Yeah, so apparently there's so we found out that the next Call of Duty could be Call of Duty Vanguard, which was T.
6927000	6935000	I mean, they've been teasing, you know, kind of some stuff for that with the Call of Duty seasons that they have right now.
6935000	6940000	But the cover art has leaked out for the game as well. So it looks like it's going to be set in World War Two.
6941000	6950000	Some think it's going to be an alternate World War Two. And they have like some kind of looks like the preorder bonus stuff as well.
6950000	6956000	So, you know, showing off some of the different operator skins and I'm going to step AFK real quick. Sorry.
6956000	6965000	Yeah. And open beta early access and stuff like that. And, you know, the front line weapons pack double XP.
6965000	6975000	Or I should say it looks like 4X XP or something like that. Cool. I guess the alternate World War Two things have been kind of done to death.
6975000	6983000	Now, if it was like a Call of Duty game set in alternate World War Two, that was also the universe of like Command & Conquer Red Alert.
6983000	6990000	That would be cool, you know, with the Tesla coils and stuff like that. Yeah, I'd be down with that.
6990000	6998000	And then you'll get some Tesla tanks in there and stuff and all the crazy stuff. Iron curtains. That's the kind of game I want to see.
6998000	7005000	But sadly, this is probably just going to be another generic Call of Duty game. So.
7005000	7006000	I'm back. Sorry.
7006000	7007000	What are you going to do?
7007000	7013000	Smoosh is losing his mind over there. Some comments from chat on the Pokemon event on Wednesday.
7013000	7020000	Shane says it's not just Arceus and Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl. Sounds like they'll be talking about other things, too.
7020000	7027000	And Carlos follows that up, saying, yeah, I expect 15 minutes of the remakes, 10 minutes of Arceus with five minutes of the other games.
7027000	7034000	Maybe a Unite update, like what Pokemon are coming to Unite. The mobile launch, maybe. I could see that.
7034000	7042000	And maybe an unannounced Pokemon game would be great, but I'm not going to set my expectations there. That's for sure.
7042000	7048000	Maybe they'll unveil how they're fixing Pokemon Go. Haha. Just kidding. All right.
7048000	7049000	They're not.
7049000	7055000	All right. If that's it for last minute stories, then I think we will go ahead and collect some final thoughts.
7055000	7061000	Thank you guys very much for listening to our show this week, whether you were here live on Twitch or if you were downloading on our podcast feed.
7061000	7068000	If you enjoyed what you heard, please help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need voices here to put out on air.
7068000	7072000	Tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread the word.
7072000	7077000	Also, an auto host here at Twitch for VOG Network goes a very long way.
7077000	7080000	And we appreciate all of you guys that do that.
7080000	7084000	If you are so inclined, you can support us via our shop.
7084000	7090000	If you want to get some OLR merchandise at vognetwork.com slash shop if you want to check that out.
7090000	7094000	My shirts finally shipped. They took a little bit to print, but I'm finally getting my new shirts for Dragon Con.
7094000	7099000	So I'm glad I thought to get that in advance because it sounds like it's going to be another week before I get those.
7099000	7104000	So, yeah, very exciting. All right. Let's get everybody's final thoughts.
7104000	7106000	Loki, how about your final thought?
7106000	7114000	My final thought is I'm still working hard on my Minecraft series, so I've got a lot of new things I want to try to implement into it.
7114000	7117000	So it's only going to make it more complicated. But cool.
7117000	7122000	All right. And my final thought is, what in the heck is this cat doing?
7122000	7126000	He's losing his mind. Cats, what can you do? What can you do?
7126000	7130000	My cat's down here screaming at me and staring at me.
7130000	7134000	We still love them, even when they're crazy. All right. That's going to do it for another OLR.
7134000	7136000	Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next week.
7136000	7139000	I know it's a little bit of a shorter show, but it's lighter on the news and no Jamie.
7139000	7143000	So it just made things shorter. But I hope you guys have a good week. We'll be back next week.
7143000	7144000	Good night, everybody.
