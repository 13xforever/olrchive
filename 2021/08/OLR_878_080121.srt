1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
You kids and your fancy M2 SSDs and your PlayStation 5s and your always on wireless

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
connections.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,720
Back in my day we had to run a cable from the kitchen to the living room, wait 30 seconds

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,200
for a modem to dial, prevent anyone from being able to use the phone and suffer the consequences

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,760
if someone tried to.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,560
And we liked it!

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,240
This is your Old Man Yells at Cloud Update.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,640
this millennium's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,480
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,460
It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 878 for this

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,100
August the 1st of 2021.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,700
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you as always with my co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh, hi.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Hello, how are you?

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Um, okay.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,380
It's been a busy, busy day, I was woken up by the sounds of the neighbors running power

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,380
tools.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Delightful.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,900
Oh boy, you gotta love power tools, love to hate them that is.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,700
I wanted to use the power tools on somebody's head.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,020
I have to go right to our chat room tonight because She-Hulk 10 is in there in chat and

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,460
we love seeing She-Hulk every week, but with this comment that I actually didn't realize

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,700
saying woohoo, MTV is 40 and that's right, that would be right.

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,500
Not that I questioned She-Hulk's trivia, but I had that realization of like, oh my gosh,

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,580
that's right because MTV started 1981, August 1st.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,980
And I watched it when it aired.

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,940
I don't think we had it on our cable.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,220
We had cable at the time.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Yeah.

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,940
Like, uh, and they were doing like some deal where you got MTV like with your package.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,260
I barely remember this.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,780
Mind you, I was like five.

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,500
Yes, I would have been three.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,340
So maybe I just am too young to remember it.

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:23,300
But I remember my, my uncle, I think turning it on to see what it was and watching the

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,340
first music video that they played, which, of course, was video killed the radio star.

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,700
So what are we going to have have now Internet TV killed video?

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,380
I think somebody made that song like Internet killed the video star.

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
I think that was a thing.

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
It might have been a parody or something.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,460
Maybe one of those songs that we used to play on the old network.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,700
But one of those songs they always attribute to Weird Al that he didn't do.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Yeah.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Yes.

48
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Yes.

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
Like a mislabeled Napster file.

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Yes.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,460
Oh, he still jokes about that, apparently.

52
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,740
Yes, exactly.

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
But yeah.

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I now I distinctly.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,600
Why shouldn't why wouldn't they celebrate this with with they should celebrate this

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
with Al TV?

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,660
Yes, they should.

58
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,220
I remember Al TV.

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,020
I distinctly remember that special.

60
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,660
I think my dad thought he was funny and I thought he was funny, too.

61
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,780
And I but I definitely remember that video.

62
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,540
I remember seeing that video on MTV, that video killed the radio star because, I mean,

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,380
in the very beginning of MTV, the first few weeks, there were only like nine music videos

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
at all.

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,780
It wasn't until much later that, you know, it caught fire that all these other record

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,900
labels started doing more videos.

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,060
I always remember Martha Quinn and Kennedy later on.

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,060
I remember Kennedy.

70
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,420
I talked to Kennedy once on a radio thing.

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Years and years and years.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
I was in high school.

73
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,820
I used to religiously watch remote control.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
Oh, yeah.

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
That was awesome.

76
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
That was my jam.

77
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,820
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:04,780
And then, you know, it's what gave us liquid television, which was something I still kind

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
of miss.

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,460
There was another show that was on very briefly called The Idiot Box, and it had Alex Winter

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
as the host.

82
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
OK.

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,700
And I think they they only aired like all of two episodes.

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,820
But at the time, I was kind of a fan girl of Alex Winter.

85
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
So I watched it.

86
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I mean, I thought it was pretty funny.

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,340
But there's also another show that I think turned into the kids in the hall.

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
The kids.

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't think because the whole started on MTV, but you might be thinking of the state

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
because the state.

91
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
That's what I'm thinking of the state.

92
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Yeah.

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
The state has a different group.

94
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,700
But a lot of those people went on to Reno 911.

95
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,260
A lot of the same people are.

96
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,660
I just remember the guy whose catchphrase is I want to stick my balls in it and he'd

97
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,940
carry around his little balls.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,100
OK, believe it or not, we are a video game podcast, but the chat room is lighting up

99
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,380
about MTV memories.

100
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,380
So you know what?

101
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
I'll indulge it.

102
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,460
And to be remote control had an NES game that was awesome.

103
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,100
And I loved it because I also love that show.

104
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
That was my lifelong dream was to be the game show host of that show.

105
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
It might still be.

106
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
So fifth dream in our.

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,700
I remember Colin Quinn on that show, too.

108
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Yes.

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,580
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

110
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,500
at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network right after the Bobby

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,820
Blackwell show.

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,140
And you guys can chat along with our show, which fifth dream is saying some of those

113
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,380
weird channel services like Pluto TV has a 24 hour pop up video station.

114
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,620
Now pop up video, of course, is VH1 thing, but very closely related by MTV.

115
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,260
But yeah, it's all it's all MTV.

116
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,820
And I thought that was all part of Paramount.

117
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,960
All the MTV shows are on Paramount Plus now.

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,620
So I'm kind of surprised it's on Pluto.

119
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,420
But actually, now now that I'm saying it out loud, I think Pluto is also a Viacom thing.

120
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,860
It's just a very different thing.

121
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,680
But this that Pluto TV app is on your PlayStation.

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,100
It's on your Xbox.

123
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,700
It's it's one of the this is a weird niche thing now.

124
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
There's like three of them.

125
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,980
These free TV apps.

126
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,620
It's like old like it's basically commercially supported old ass movies like Netflix.

127
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,860
So you don't have to pay a monthly fee for it.

128
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,160
Or they also have like live TV.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
And they have very niche TV stations.

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,440
Like there was one station on there that played nothing but RuPaul's Drag Race all day long.

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,360
Just Drag Race, Marathon 24.

132
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,840
I think they finally pulled it.

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
I don't know why, but they did.

134
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
But there was a Survivor one, too.

135
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
And there's all sorts.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,680
There's an uncensored Hell's Kitchen, I think is on that same one.

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,760
So anyway, there's also getting me to sit down and watch TV, which it doesn't happen

138
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,520
unless it's Drag Race or Jessica Jones.

139
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Yeah.

140
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,760
I think there's something to be said about turning on the TV and having that background

141
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,040
noise while you're folding laundry or whatever it is.

142
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,520
You know, sometimes you don't know what YouTube's for.

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Yeah.

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
I think a lot.

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,400
You know, but I think these like Pluto TV and the etc.

146
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
I can't remember the names of the other ones.

147
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
To be might be another one.

148
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I can't remember.

149
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Sorry, guys.

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,040
That that kind of can also fill that with extremely niche things, kind of like how YouTube

151
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
can do.

152
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,760
You're absolutely right with that.

153
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,260
And Pod Culture saying Pluto had a Doctor Who channel, the next generation.

154
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
You're right.

155
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,100
I think there's like a Star Trek channel on there.

156
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Absolutely.

157
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Yes.

158
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,340
And the old school Nickelodeon channel is on one of those.

159
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,940
As long as that showed the tomorrow people, I'd be interested.

160
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
It might.

161
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
It might.

162
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Look it up.

163
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Look it up.

164
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
I want to see what else was.

165
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,780
What if there was like old British sci fi, like it played like Blake seven or something?

166
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,400
Honestly, it probably exists somewhere.

167
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,540
It might not be on that same app, but I bet that of course, that's a niche that somebody

168
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,240
you know who to ask our friends over British invaders.

169
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,480
They would know he could send our pals over their email about that.

170
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,240
Bobby Black Wolf speaking of an event where I sometimes see our friends, at least one

171
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
of our friends from British invaders.

172
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,520
Bobby Black Wolf says our Dragon Con panel is called Video Didn't Kill the Podcast Star.

173
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
So that's right.

174
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
There's there's a panel.

175
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
We're doing it again this year.

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,720
We've done it at least one other year, maybe two.

177
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
It's kind of about our transition from doing a long running podcast to the video format.

178
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
So you're right.

179
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,160
That name is kind of a little play on that as well.

180
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,020
So it's pretty, pretty fun.

181
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,840
So anyway, I should also mention, because you might be wondering, not joining us tonight

182
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
is Tech Master Loki.

183
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,040
You might be like, where's Loki go?

184
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,900
He just he had a family obligation.

185
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
It happens sometimes.

186
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,720
So he's just not here tonight, but he'll be back next week.

187
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,380
So it happens.

188
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,440
Sometimes we get to take a night off.

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,480
So Loki, Loki has the night off, but he'll be back next week.

190
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,160
So it's just dark Sakura and I feeling the love.

191
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
So tonight's the night.

192
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,560
It's just going to be the Dead by Daylight show.

193
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,680
You already I'm still working on that, too.

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,880
I need a co-host, maybe.

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,280
Maybe we'll indulge a little bit tonight, because without Matt here, we kind of have

196
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,400
a shorter list of stories that and I think it just kind of generally was.

197
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,680
There's some big things you talk about, but the whole scope of things was a bit of a slower

198
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
news week.

199
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,540
And I think that's just, you know, summer still being in full swing and all of that

200
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
stuff happening.

201
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
What's that?

202
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Yeah.

203
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
That's just how it is.

204
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Yes.

205
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Just how it is right now.

206
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Let's see.

207
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,140
Bobby Black Wolf with a very good point saying, thanks to data caps, I'll never have a streaming

208
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,940
channel on that I wasn't actively watching.

209
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
That's a very good point.

210
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,080
I don't watch a lot of the streaming stuff, but I'll watch it here and there.

211
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,060
But Twitch is a lot of my background stuff, too.

212
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,300
Like I'll put on a streamer that I like and I found a lot in the last few months ever

213
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,060
since Alan got me into freaking Dead by Daylight, you know, and I kind of found that whole

214
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,380
community in dark soccer.

215
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,340
I know this hits home for you, too, is it's like there's I don't know how I got so deep

216
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
with these people.

217
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,420
It's just endless amounts of content out there with all of that.

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,400
So well, and it's like now it's it's like, you know, I never, ever expected that when

219
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,540
I go into one of the the bigger guys chat rooms that I'd get, oh, hi, welcome in.

220
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,460
I'm glad that you made it to me.

221
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Yeah.

222
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm like, are we friends?

223
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,020
This is great.

224
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Are we friends?

225
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,660
Which is interesting, Jamie, because to pretty much, you know, a lot of people that are here

226
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,400
on Sunday night, you you are a rock star and have been for many, many, many years.

227
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,180
So to be to be acknowledged by you for a lot of people here.

228
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,260
And I'm not trying to I'm not trying to completely gaslight you here, but I think this is like

229
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,940
one of those like, you know, in these parts, I when Senpai notices them, there's a lot

230
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,200
of people that are very happy.

231
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,820
So it's just it's it's neat that there are other I notice all of you chatters.

232
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,280
So Senpai noticed you.

233
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah, I actually it's funny, I'm I'm working on and this is just like a little aside.

234
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm working on some bit redeems for my channel.

235
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,560
You know, like cheap stuff, right?

236
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
And one of them is Senpai notice me.

237
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
That's cute.

238
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
I like that.

239
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,200
I like I like the release.

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm having like I don't stream a lot, a lot on my personal channel.

241
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,140
You know, I keep saying I need to do it more, but it's hard when Alan and I are sharing

242
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,780
that space and especially in the summer when it gets really hot.

243
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,220
But I think about those types of things and what to do for those regimes.

244
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,660
And I do like the streamers that have these really cute, like short little things that

245
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,460
they do, like one streamer that I watch a lot, does a little thing where he'll just

246
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,800
go boop and that's it.

247
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,380
That's like basically what you're doing.

248
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
And there's that's Nick.

249
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Nick.

250
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
Yeah.

251
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
There's another one that'll get up.

252
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,060
Yesterday, one that Alan watches a lot, that'll just get up and hug like to stand up and do

253
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
a hug.

254
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I like that.

255
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
That's cute.

256
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,300
There's some Laurie Bird does the vocoder singing.

257
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,580
Oh, that's cute.

258
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
That is really cute.

259
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,380
But but no, I've I you know, I've learned a lot actually just in playing Dead by Daylight

260
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,780
and about the stream set ups and everything from just watching other people and talking

261
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
to them.

262
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,140
I'm still behind on quite a few things because I game on a Mac.

263
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,340
You know, they're like, I can't run like chat bot.

264
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,940
I have to run cloud bot, you know, and I figure some stuff out.

265
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,980
I can't do some of the games.

266
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
And slabs is garbage.

267
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,460
Slobs, I'm sorry.

268
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,820
Well, by garbage, I mean, it doesn't see my stadia window.

269
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,140
And I do most of my gaming through stadia, which because of you, because I think it was

270
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,340
you that that suggested that I start putting stadia in my tags when I go live.

271
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,580
I have met other stadia Dead by Daylight players.

272
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,260
I am no longer alone in the world.

273
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Thank you.

274
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Thank you.

275
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Thank you.

276
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Yes, that was me.

277
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
I know.

278
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,500
I remember suggesting that because I said you have it.

279
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,060
You're a special snowflake in the stadia thing.

280
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
And I wasn't.

281
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
But I will say this.

282
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,820
I didn't think it would be other Dead by Daylight state.

283
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,420
I thought it would just be stadia enthusiasts.

284
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,100
There were a couple that were just stadia, but a couple were also dead by daylight.

285
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Huh?

286
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Well, there you go.

287
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Yeah.

288
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,140
So other people are familiar with Miss Debbie.

289
00:12:53,140 --> 00:13:01,300
I do find that I have good luck with the growth of my channel when I try not to stream one

290
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
thing.

291
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,340
Like, I don't get a lot of new followers when I play Final Fantasy 14 because I always play

292
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,900
Final Fantasy 14.

293
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,460
But like, one of the best nights I got a lot of new followers was when I did No Man's Sky

294
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,140
out of the blue for the first time.

295
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,780
I got people that watch a lot of No Man's Sky where it's like, oh, this is a new name.

296
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,420
Who is this doing this?

297
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,060
And I know this happens to Alan started playing his music games on Monday nights.

298
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,100
And he gets a lot like that spin rhythm.

299
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,540
He just randomly started playing on stage apparently has a rabid fan community behind

300
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,540
it.

301
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,220
Because when he streams that game, he gets all these new people that show up that will

302
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,640
that are looking for that game particularly and all the mods behind it and everything.

303
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,400
So it is it is interesting how I find that mixing that up does kind of let you get seen

304
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,920
by more people because your keywords change.

305
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Right.

306
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,800
So when when I beat Fantasian because I'm getting close to that.

307
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Oh, I bet.

308
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,960
I need to think of something new for for Tuesday fantasy zone.

309
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,160
So maybe I'll do Hataful Boyfriend again, or maybe I'll find something else who knows

310
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,720
you want my suggestions.

311
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Do you want my honest suggestion live on air, even though, you know, you didn't ask for

312
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
it?

313
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Sure.

314
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,440
We to me, Dark Soccer and chat room, feel free to agree, disagree.

315
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,800
To me, Dark Soccer, you're the queen of retro gaming.

316
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,960
It's one of the huge things that like you bring to the show, your knowledge, your depth,

317
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,520
your fandom for these sometimes downright obscure things that not the rest of us really

318
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,760
like know a lot about.

319
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,480
Like I am surprised you don't stream more retro.

320
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,860
I realize the setup.

321
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,940
You don't have the right capture stuff for that setup.

322
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,140
But I would almost say just cheat and use emulators because emulate it.

323
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
Yeah.

324
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,460
Chances are you own it.

325
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,020
So you're not really breaking the rules.

326
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,180
Like I might I might try to dig up, see if there's a version of Magic Engine that runs

327
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,540
and play through one of those translated like Rondo of Blood or something.

328
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
Yeah.

329
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
I think that would be fun.

330
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Yeah.

331
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,780
Of course, it's just going to be me playing as Maria with her terrible singing.

332
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,620
But there's a lot of people that are probably never even seen it.

333
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,980
So you know, there was a Castlevania collection, though it had it on there.

334
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Oh, that's right.

335
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
That's right.

336
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Yeah.

337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,980
So although I actually do kind of want to play, I've also been thinking about maybe

338
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,180
playing Jackie Crush.

339
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,820
Which is in the Devil's Crush family.

340
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,100
It was a SNES one that came out.

341
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Wow.

343
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
That would be awesome.

344
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Yeah.

345
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Mike Defton Chats is at this point.

346
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I don't think most people will care if you use emulators.

347
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
No.

348
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,340
And especially if it's like the stepping stone to, you know, going, OK, there is interest

349
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
in this.

350
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,200
And now maybe I will make that investment in whatever capture card I need to hook up

351
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
the old Saturn or whatever it is.

352
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,860
I think that, you know, might be might be a way to do it.

353
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,700
So that'd be great if I can do Saturn emulation on my Mac.

354
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
That would be awesome.

355
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah.

356
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
Food for thought.

357
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
All right.

358
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,660
We're we're several minutes into the show and we haven't even gotten to the kickoff

359
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
topic.

360
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,860
But that's that's what happens when Loki isn't here to mediate us.

361
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,340
We will just talk about whatever we want.

362
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,900
I just picture his flat stare while we're jabbering and who am I?

363
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Who am I kidding?

364
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,620
He's he's going to get off topic just as much so that's part of the charm here at Orange

365
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Lounge Radio.

366
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
It is what it is.

367
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
All right.

368
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,900
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

369
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,380
Actually, we kind of have a you know, this is eight hundred and seventy eight episodes

370
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,660
Orange Lounge Radio.

371
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,140
We've been doing the format with the kickoff topic at least as long as we've been on Twitch,

372
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,220
if not longer.

373
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,900
This doesn't happen a lot where the same thing needs to be talked about at the top of the

374
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,660
show two weeks in a row sometimes, but not a lot.

375
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,340
We're in that position tonight because this is a very important shift in the industry

376
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
that's happening right now.

377
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,380
This is a very important reckoning for the industry.

378
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,660
And you notice I'm not saying one company, I'm saying the industry that I is playing

379
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,080
out through one company right now.

380
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,240
But Dark Soccer, if you don't mind, I will let you take it from here.

381
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
Oh, yeah.

382
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:08,840
So on this past Wednesday, hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees walked out and this was

383
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:18,960
after the lawsuit and Blizzard's rather dismissive release on terms.

384
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,780
You know, they're oh, we're sorry, but blah, blah, blah.

385
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,000
You don't say I'm sorry, but you say I'm sorry and don't do the shit again.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,500
So at any rate, there was a walk out where they rallied in front of the Blizzard headquarters

387
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,980
in Irvine to protest their response to the discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit.

388
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,460
It was attended by more than 350 people.

389
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,120
There were some signs out.

390
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,580
One of them said nerf male privilege.

391
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,720
Another one said unaccountable corporate bureaucrats are driving the best employees out of Activision

392
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,360
Blizzard.

393
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,500
The walkout started at 10 a.m. Pacific and ended at 2 p.m.

394
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,080
Also other companies were supporting the employees and actually sent food trucks out and catered

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,340
and brought porta potties.

396
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,980
Oh, I hadn't heard of that.

397
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Interesting.

398
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:26,780
People were driving by and honking in support and there were people that spoke out about

399
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:39,080
it, but they wanted an anonymity for fear of retribution from the company.

400
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,940
And then, of course, on social media, there was, of course, a call to not cross the virtual

401
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,880
picket line by playing their games.

402
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,800
That's including Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty.

403
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,940
And honestly, I don't think I have played an Activision Blizzard game since the deal

404
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,580
with the Chinese gamer with the free Hong Kong.

405
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,040
But yeah, I am completely with this kind of behavior, I don't care how much you love a

406
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,700
game, you know, this is something this gross behavior.

407
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:30,380
I mean, they say that boycotts don't really do a lot, but I think the walkout will do

408
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,820
quite a bit.

409
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:40,140
And I do think that people making an active and vocal choice not to put their money into

410
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:48,860
the company, while it may not be financially effective, I think it will be effective in

411
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
terms of commentary.

412
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,360
Does that make sense?

413
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Yes.

414
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
And I think the good thing about the walkout, especially too, was something we were talking

415
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,040
about last week about how this is not a every Blizzard and Activision employee problem.

416
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,920
In fact, there are a lot of fantastic people working for Activision Blizzard who are sick

417
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,520
and tired of this crap as well.

418
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,960
And I think that walkout really sort of personified that, and I think helped a lot of people out

419
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,280
there who maybe hadn't gotten to that point yet really see that this is not an issue of

420
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,220
all the employees at Activision Blizzard.

421
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,180
This is a management issue.

422
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm going to make a more extreme comparison though, and there were a lot of people that

423
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,720
didn't vote in the 2016 election, were they good people?

424
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Because they partly enabled you-know-who.

425
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Debatable.

426
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,940
But that my point stands.

427
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,660
Every scenario is different, right?

428
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,640
There are good people that do nothing.

429
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,240
I'm glad they're doing something now that they feel empowered to do it, but there needs

430
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,600
to be a degree of fearlessness when it comes to confronting any sort of abusive and oppressive

431
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
behavior.

432
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Right.

433
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,320
At some point it becomes damn the consequences.

434
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Right.

435
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,280
But and I think that's where you kind of see the industry sort of inching closer and closer

436
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,920
to probably some type of unionization or at least maybe like some type of like representation

437
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,520
where there's like a legal defense sort of thing for the you know, because you just said

438
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,320
it a minute ago is that there were some people speaking out with anonymity because they feared

439
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,400
repercussions.

440
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,620
So that whole thing is still a very valid threat looming for a lot of people.

441
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,520
And we all know that shouldn't exist.

442
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,440
That shouldn't in a perfect world that shouldn't exist.

443
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,280
Unfortunately, you know, some people really still feel it does.

444
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,220
So at least there needs to be that banding of employees.

445
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,920
You know, I think it ought to just be a union, but at least let's take those baby steps in

446
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,300
that direction of some type of like legal defense, a wall together that, you know, we

447
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,660
are able to speak out when we see these things without repercussion.

448
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,560
And maybe, sorry, real quick, maybe that's something that we go to our government.

449
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,500
And I harped on this a lot last week where we applaud the government making these changes

450
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,140
in the right direction and taking this action that they took.

451
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Sorry, Jamie, go ahead.

452
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:23,020
Well, I was saying that that there were Ubisoft employees also who decided to step up in light

453
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,800
of this.

454
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,240
And there was an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard employees, and they

455
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,580
sent it to their CEO, Yves Guillemot.

456
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,300
It is clear from the frequency of these reports that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained

457
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,400
culture of abusive behavior within the industry.

458
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,800
It should no longer be a surprise to anyone, employees, executives, journalists or fans

459
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,040
that these heinous acts are going on.

460
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:59,280
And it called for the employees of Ubisoft, Blizzard, other leaders in the industry to

461
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,780
get together and, quote, agreed to a set of rules and processes for handling reports of

462
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
these offenses.

463
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,780
Bingo.

464
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,300
The company shouldn't be doing this.

465
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,520
This is going to require a bigger touch.

466
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:20,440
And then there was another another employee of Blizzard, Sabrina Brogan, who informed

467
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,560
the Activision Blizzard King Women's Network that she was going to step down as the network's

468
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Europe, Middle East and Africa lead after seeing this email from.

469
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,200
Let's see, from their chief complaint from Blizzard's chief compliance officer, Francis

470
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Townsend.

471
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
Oh, we got to talk about her.

472
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
She got to go.

473
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,000
She's got to go.

474
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Where the lawsuit was called a distorted and untrue picture of our company.

475
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:59,120
And and the reason why Sabrina stepped down is because Townsend is also the executive

476
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,720
sponsor for the Women's Network.

477
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,880
And so she resigned.

478
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,440
She means Brogan resigned and and she put out the message saying, I am ashamed I am

479
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,520
working for this company.

480
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,560
Fran Townsend, by the way, if you look at her Twitter account at Fran Townsend made

481
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,200
a tweet on July 30th.

482
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,960
So this was not an old thing dug up to use against her now.

483
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,680
July 30th of this year.

484
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,100
So two days ago.

485
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,280
She tags two people and puts and the problem with whistleblowing by the Atlantic and links

486
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,280
to an article titled The New Moral Code of America's Elite.

487
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:50,240
So she tweets an article about the problem with whistleblowers.

488
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,680
She's she needs to and this is this is odd.

489
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
She's corporate garbage.

490
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,160
Because I should be saying we need to uplift.

491
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,520
We need to uplift women.

492
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,560
We need to, you know, have more women in these types of positions and so forth.

493
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,180
But unfortunately, gang, not this one.

494
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,780
My tweet to her was you are the problem.

495
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,860
Bobby Blackwell points out, if you can look at her Twitter account, she's blocking everyone,

496
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,100
including her fellow co-workers.

497
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,600
She needs to pack her boxes and leave, as a lot of people do at Activision Blizzard

498
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,140
in the management district.

499
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Honestly, I'm surprised that people aren't actually actively reporting her account.

500
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Anyway.

501
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
Yeah.

502
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,260
Some folks in chat, she says, yeah, she has to go.

503
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
Terrible lady.

504
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
Yeah.

505
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,380
And it's I think it's an example of you can still, you know, actively be working against

506
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,060
the, you know, group that you're a part of that you're supposed to be uplifting.

507
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
Yeah.

508
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,020
As you heard, Matt says she also sent that company wide email shaming people for whistleblowing.

509
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,300
Even Bobby Kotick criticized her stance.

510
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,140
Bobby Kotick replied to this whole thing.

511
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,300
It took him a few days.

512
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,020
I don't want to compliment it, but I will say this.

513
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,920
At least he outlined some steps.

514
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm not sure they were the right steps overall, especially when you consider some of the companies

515
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
they're saying they're working with.

516
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,340
So again, I'm going to be very careful how much of a gold star I'm going to get.

517
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm giving one gold piece of glitter for at least this actually says, here are some actionable

518
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,520
steps we're going to take, which is more than you might have taken down that post.

519
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
No.

520
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,160
Well, I'm looking at it right now on my phone, unless she did it between the time the show

521
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,160
started and now, which is certainly possible because I'm sure she's getting a lot of shit

522
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
for it.

523
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:57,480
Um, I will screenshot that bad boy and I'm going to send it to my friend, Dark Sakura.

524
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
And I'm going to do that one more time.

525
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
I just blocked her.

526
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Okay.

527
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,080
Now you'll never find it.

528
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
All right.

529
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
There you go.

530
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Well, you sent me a screenshot.

531
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
So that's different.

532
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
You're right.

533
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I did.

534
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
Um, screenshots are forever.

535
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Yeah.

536
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,880
Oh, what a, yeah, I'm going to say it.

537
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
What a cunt.

538
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Seriously.

539
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
All right.

540
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
We'll just leave it at that.

541
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Anyway.

542
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Um, anything else you want to mention or, or chat wants to mention about this, uh, ongoing

543
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
story?

544
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Um, well, I was looking at just some of the stuff about, uh, codex, um, letter and I like,

545
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:45,200
I like this, um, uh, quote, uh, from, it says, while we are pleased to see that our collective

546
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,740
voices have convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications, this response

547
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,880
fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.

548
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
That's the crux of it.

549
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Yeah.

550
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,080
Um, that, that's why I gave a gold piece of glitter.

551
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Yeah.

552
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,000
Just one tiny little gold, gold thing.

553
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,960
Um, but there are other parts of it such as, and as chat points out, uh, Mike Deaf saying

554
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,480
granted Bobby Kotick also brought the anti-union firm to activists.

555
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,800
That's why I'm going to refrain from getting a gold star or anything further.

556
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Yeah.

557
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Um, but one piece of gold glitter, I mean, Hey, you know what?

558
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,040
He gets a star drawn in a gold jelly ink on cardboard.

559
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
You know what?

560
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
You know what they say?

561
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,120
A broken clock is right twice a day.

562
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,520
And I think in some of these scenarios, it's like, okay, congrats.

563
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Yay.

564
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
You did it.

565
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
You were right today.

566
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Congrats.

567
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Thanks, captain obvious.

568
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,420
You should at least call that out because you know.

569
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:43,720
What we need, and I, I, I understand some of my audience, right?

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,660
We need fewer male voices in the industry.

571
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,600
We need the men to stop talking about it and listen to the women talk about it.

572
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,080
I would agree in the sense of that, all the decision makers should not be men.

573
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Period.

574
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,720
Uh, and we need, we mean, we have need more diversity in management period.

575
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:12,040
Well, I'm just saying though, that instead of spotlighting, you know, these men in upper

576
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:20,160
management who, I mean, I would grant that many of them are probably just saying what

577
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,720
needs to be heard to stay, you know, profitable.

578
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,920
I'm going to say it, but I think that we need to hear more of the people that's experienced

579
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
it.

580
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,360
We need to hear from the women who have been fired or abused.

581
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,380
We need to hear their voices and need to listen to them.

582
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,840
Critical myth and chat says these companies need a flush of upper management at the very

583
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
least.

584
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,640
We need to be flushed down the toilet.

585
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,760
That's my, it's weird to say, but my hope is that that, that storms are coming.

586
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,440
Oh, it is that.

587
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,960
That's my hope.

588
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,680
Not that any, not that any of this is good news.

589
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,020
I mean, if we look at the Activision Blizzard and the complaints, a woman died like that's

590
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,160
a woman died because of it's even worse.

591
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,040
She apparently took her life.

592
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Yeah.

593
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:24,720
So there's, there's no good news here, but if there's something that you can go, maybe

594
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,920
change will happen this time.

595
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:36,320
Well, and then there was that whole post about, um, uh, on the verge about the Cosby suite.

596
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
Oh yeah.

597
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,280
That's so, Oh, that when I just seeing the picture.

598
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,840
So I'm going to tell you something about autism.

599
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Okay.

600
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,960
Sometimes it's possible to feel so much emotion that all of them shut off.

601
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,740
I don't get like that very, very often.

602
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,120
I was like that.

603
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:08,800
I could not feel anything and I couldn't talk for a while because it angered and frustrated

604
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,780
me so much that my, my feelings just shut completely down.

605
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
I shut down.

606
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
That's how mad I got.

607
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,980
Somebody else in chat, I'm sorry, I forgot who said, I couldn't even finish the article

608
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
said that in chat.

609
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Yeah.

610
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,980
So I, I, I think there's a lot of people, um, definitely feeling some sort of way from

611
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
that article.

612
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
It was, it was gross.

613
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,260
Um, it's absolutely disgusting.

614
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,780
And all of those faces in there.

615
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,380
I want every last one of those people identified and made public.

616
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,940
I think that's already happened.

617
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Uh, for sure.

618
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,460
Now because, uh, Oh yes, because one of them works at riot now, one of them was ghost crawler

619
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,620
and he's at riot now and had to put out this whole letter that he sent to his riot folks

620
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,540
saying, Hey, this article came out and I want to apologize for this and kind of like kind

621
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
of set his stance.

622
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,100
But it's one of those things where it's like, apologize cause he got caught.

623
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,020
It's just one of those things where it's like, you know, even if it is from 2013 or whatever

624
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,260
eight years ago or something, there's just not a lot that can be said to justify it.

625
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Like I, and here's the thing, and I, I just, just to put it out there.

626
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,980
I have, I have heard the whole, well, that picture was from 2013 and the Bill Cosby stuff

627
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:21,140
didn't come out till 2015 but I think to go that route sort of misses the overarching

628
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
point.

629
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,460
And let's go back to that lawsuit.

630
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,100
We're going to go back to that lawsuit.

631
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,700
Why did Activision Blizzard get slapped on the wrist by the state in the first place?

632
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,460
It was that frat boy culture.

633
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:40,540
And what do I see when I hear about the luxury suite where all the male employees go to drink

634
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,100
once BlizzCon is over?

635
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,140
What is that?

636
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,100
No matter what it's called.

637
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,940
That's frat boy culture.

638
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,980
That absolutely is.

639
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:58,740
Well, and SSJ 100 Matt basically does make a point.

640
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,380
Many female voices like, okay, so Jade Raymond gets spotlight constantly, but many female

641
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,140
voices like her get death threats and harass so much.

642
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
It's a culture problem that needs to be fixed.

643
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:14,300
I don't know how to fix it other than giving more to uplift those voices and hold people

644
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
accountable.

645
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,500
And that's exactly it.

646
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:24,660
But the thing is, is that if enough, if enough people raise their voice, if enough people

647
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,620
step out, they can't stop all of us.

648
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,500
That's 100% it.

649
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,100
And this is what you, because I don't think anybody here does that garbage.

650
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,380
If you do, all I have to say is that you're in the wrong place or you need to change your

651
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,700
behavior immediately, period.

652
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,140
But I think what we all can do, all of us here at OLR, VoG, all of us decent people

653
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,060
in the gaming industry of which there are more of us than the other side, trust.

654
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,700
What we have to do, even though it is uncomfortable sometimes, we have to stop giving our passive

655
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,180
approval to those sorts of comments directed at Jade Raymond and women, et cetera, by saying

656
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,220
nothing.

657
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,460
Speak up and call out.

658
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,760
You have to speak up.

659
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,240
You have to call out.

660
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,300
Exactly it.

661
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,740
And I'm not saying sit down and shut up just because they are a woman.

662
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,820
You are able to be critical of women when they do, you know, such as what's her name

663
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,820
that I just said?

664
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,820
I get fired.

665
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
Fran Townsend.

666
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
OK.

667
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,980
When there is a.

668
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,680
But notice, I'm not sitting here going, you know, F that B, even though I kind of feel

669
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
that way.

670
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
But you know what I mean?

671
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
I said it.

672
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
I know.

673
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,060
But there's there's more substance behind it.

674
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,180
You have a reason to be able to say that.

675
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:54,980
That is not just she's a woman and therefore she should be in the kitchen and baby, whatever,

676
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
all that.

677
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
All the bullshit.

678
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
What she needs to do is be in a dungeon.

679
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Just say it.

680
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,860
And not even the fun kind.

681
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Anyhow.

682
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
Yeah.

683
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,620
My Deft in Chat says everything about that room is horrible.

684
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,620
Talking about the Cosby Street.

685
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Sorry.

686
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Go ahead.

687
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,500
But but I mean, maybe we should make this a campaign.

688
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,420
You know, the the speak up and call out.

689
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,440
Maybe that should be like a campaign or something that that we start and spread around.

690
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,600
We make it a thing.

691
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,660
I think if every one of us goes out, you know, even the people listening right now, the people

692
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:39,180
listening to the the recording afterwards to the podcast, if everyone just stops and

693
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,460
calls for it, you know, the word could spread, you know, call for it.

694
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,980
Ask other people to call for it.

695
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,320
Step up, you know, step up to it.

696
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,700
It nothing changes until you make it change.

697
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Right.

698
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,700
And if you sit there on your ass, go, oh, I agree her and don't do shit.

699
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Guess what you get for it?

700
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
You get shit.

701
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Yeah, nothing.

702
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,980
If you don't change, you're always going to get the same result.

703
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:10,380
And that's this is this is a theme you're hearing amongst lots of things the past couple

704
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,320
of years, because it is that it's that whole talk about we need the folks in the position

705
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,340
of privilege to be able to speak out.

706
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
Right.

707
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,440
So for it to use and to use an analogy to talk about something directly where this applies

708
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,960
in another place.

709
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,480
So when we talk about Black Lives Matter, right, then if I believe that Black Lives

710
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,620
Matter and I do and I want to, you know, support, you know, all of the my my friends that are

711
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:45,140
black and everything, then I need to when I hear two white people telling a black joke,

712
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:50,060
I have to step up, which thank God I haven't heard that in a long time, a long time.

713
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,260
But, you know, in my life, years and years ago, especially in the high school days, those

714
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,020
are the types of shitty things I would hear sometimes.

715
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,620
And so I have to be able to speak up and say, that's not funny.

716
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,420
Like, did you have you looked at the calendar?

717
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
It's 2021.

718
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Yeah, right.

719
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,300
Why did you think that it was OK to say that joke in front of me?

720
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,980
And if I'm not able to have that uncomfortable conversation, nothing's going to change.

721
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,340
And that's it.

722
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
And it's the same thing.

723
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,140
It's the same thing with with LGBT, et cetera.

724
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,420
If I'm sure there are people that have told gay jokes about me behind my back and my true

725
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,420
friends are the ones that stick up and say, don't do that.

726
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Mm hmm.

727
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Oh, sorry.

728
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
Go ahead.

729
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm actually I'm actually making my post about it right now so that, you know, I can hopefully

730
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,860
get it started.

731
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,300
I really think that we need to have more more said about it.

732
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
So, yeah.

733
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,540
As Joan Hunter Matt in chat says, did you see there was that other story about the pregnant

734
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,260
women woman who management refused to give her time to see the doctor when she was having

735
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
complications?

736
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,940
I forgot what Activision Blizzard's response was to it, but it made my blood boil.

737
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,980
Well, those are the types of issues where that's why the state is getting involved with

738
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,460
a lawsuit now, because that type of stuff is straight up against the law.

739
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,340
And that's why you're seeing that being leveraged.

740
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:23,740
So so unfortunately, correct me if I'm wrong, but the Cosby suite and all that stuff.

741
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,500
I mean, we can look at it and go, that's pretty fucked up.

742
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,940
But there's nothing the state of California can really do about it.

743
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,740
They're not breaking the law, per se, unless something illegal goes on in that suite.

744
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,500
They're not breaking the law.

745
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,060
This, as Joan Hunter Matt pointed out, that was breaking the law.

746
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
That's discrimination against somebody because they're pregnant.

747
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,020
And that is very much that's certainly against the law in California, if not at the federal

748
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,960
level, which I'm pretty sure it is.

749
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,540
That's basically a form of sexual harassment, long story short.

750
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,900
So that is why Activision Blizzard is in trouble with the state of California.

751
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,140
It's now among other things.

752
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,540
Please don't get me wrong, but it's just these other things that are now kind of playing

753
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,700
into it alongside of that, that's, you know, making it making it a moment of reckoning

754
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,500
for the whole industry, for sure.

755
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,420
Sia Tabiri in chat says a few months ago, someone I knew in high school messaged me

756
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,980
and told me he was always amazed at how well I dealt with stuff in high school.

757
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,100
And apparently I'd blocked out a lot or I was not aware of a lot of bullying, harassment,

758
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,120
bad stuff that went on behind my back.

759
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,540
I don't know if this is like too raw for me to get into on a video game podcast, but all

760
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,660
I can say is that, like, I really feel that comment because there are definitely a lot

761
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,840
of parts of high school, especially junior high school, that I straight up have blocked

762
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,420
out, blacked out.

763
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:58,700
Like I look back on certain memories I can and I actually think some of that plays into

764
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,460
the memory issues I have ongoing today because I have that's how PTSD works, Rob.

765
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,060
Well, then guess what?

766
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,340
I mean, we're not going to diagnose those sorts of things on the show, but I can tell

767
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,060
you this is someone who has PTSD.

768
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,780
If you want to if you want to go that direction, then perhaps.

769
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,780
But all I can say is that, you know, that type of stuff and the associated traumas and

770
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:27,540
stuff left me to this place where now I barely I have a hard time remembering a lot of things,

771
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,420
and I think some of that plays into it for sure, absolutely.

772
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:37,820
Now, the good news is video games were oftentimes my escape from all of that, to be quite honest,

773
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:44,580
because video games were an awesome story, video games where I could escape a lot of

774
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:52,180
that and get into a world where, you know, I wasn't being threatened with violence and

775
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
called names.

776
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:59,220
But anyway, we won't get into that.

777
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,180
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, yeah, I've blocked out a lot of high school as well.

778
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,280
I remember the worst things, but not a lot of stuff in between.

779
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,740
It's interesting because I always get asked, are you going to go to your high school reunion?

780
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,380
And I'm always like, I can think of nothing in this world I want to do less.

781
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,820
My high school, honestly, once I stopped giving a shit and punch that one girl in the

782
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,640
nose, no one gave me a problem anymore.

783
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,900
I've blocked out most of my home life.

784
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:35,920
And it was for being a woman or, you know, a girl at the time that dared to speak up,

785
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:47,120
to call her stepdad a sexist asshole, to question everything, to be weird.

786
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,200
You know, I got it more at home than I did at school.

787
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,760
And that is, I'm not going to go into a lot of that because it really is, a lot of it

788
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,540
is super personal, but you need, I, we really need to make, and this is actually going back

789
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,860
to the Activision Blizzard thing.

790
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:11,940
We need to make safe spaces for people so that they can speak up and not just to speak

791
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,140
up, but to have a fucking break.

792
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,940
I think we need to recognize there's a lot of people who very clearly have been through

793
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,940
some trauma in the gaming industry and they need that type of space.

794
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Absolutely.

795
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
100%.

796
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
Yeah.

797
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,720
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I go back to my high school reunion to get all the apologies.

798
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,500
You know, it's, I get, I get that comment.

799
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
I do.

800
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,420
Um, from my perspective, I'm just kind of like, I, it's, it's, it's weird.

801
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:46,140
I literally do not care about a lot of those people and I'm, I mean, I just, and there

802
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,020
are some people from high school that are very cool.

803
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,780
I keep in touch with on Facebook and stuff like that.

804
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,980
I don't want to make it sound like every single person in high school was Dick.

805
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,940
No, there was a lot of them, but like, it's hard to explain.

806
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,360
Like I, like as far as like the people who bullied me and stuff, do I, do I want to go

807
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,220
and like a big Romy and Michelle high school reunion sort of thing and show them all up

808
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,220
and all that?

809
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,860
No, I, it's, it's, I, I don't, I don't know what easy way to put it.

810
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,060
I don't care if those people are dead.

811
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,800
I don't care if those people are millionaires.

812
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,020
I don't exist in your universe.

813
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,300
They don't exist to me.

814
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Exactly.

815
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,720
I have had to block them out and cut them out like little like dolls or something.

816
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,940
I do not care about these people.

817
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,100
Yeah.

818
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:34,420
I followed a few on Facebook, but I was like, your lives are boring.

819
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,660
You're boring.

820
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:43,620
You said you had all of this, just all of these, you know, dreams that you had and career

821
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,820
stuff that you wanted to do.

822
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,500
And I'm talking mostly about the girls I knew.

823
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Right.

824
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,700
And you know, and I'm not putting this down as, as a choice, mind you, but like they got

825
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,780
married young and had lots of kids and now they're Christian mom.

826
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,540
And I'm like, you're fucking boring.

827
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:12,700
You stopped defining your life by your terms and did it by the terms of other people.

828
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,140
And yeah, that's where I think we're getting off topic.

829
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
It's fine.

830
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
It's fine.

831
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,140
Uh, there's, there's a lot of, see, see what these stories bring out though.

832
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,580
It is.

833
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
It is a lot to unpack.

834
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,940
And I think that's why there's a lot of people reacting to this, you know, and maybe they're

835
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,740
not even involved with it directly, but it's kind of like, um, you were saying in our chat

836
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,100
person was saying, I see stuff like that Cosby suite thing.

837
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,260
And I just, I don't know what you want to call it.

838
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,260
I disassociate.

839
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,140
I, everybody responds different ways to it.

840
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,180
I just, I'm, I just, I flow it out of my body.

841
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
I can't see it.

842
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
Yeah.

843
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
It stops existing.

844
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Yep.

845
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,180
Anyway.

846
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,820
That's kind of what happened when my emotions shut down.

847
00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,620
I had to basically wipe it before I could think or feel again.

848
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,620
Okay.

849
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,440
Anyway, let's go on to happier topics.

850
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
Video games.

851
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,620
They're great and escapism.

852
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,340
And because of them, we all met each other.

853
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,660
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

854
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,660
this week.

855
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,040
And I I've been playing a lot, uh, but I'll start with you, Darzaga.

856
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,820
I killed a bunch of people in Dead by Daylight.

857
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,340
I don't know what it has been, but it's either complete fail with the shittiest of survivors,

858
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:36,240
like and by shitty, I mean just like salty little tryhards or it's been really engaging

859
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,460
matches that have been fun to play and, and that I've won.

860
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,140
And Rob, a miracle happened.

861
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,140
You got a four K.

862
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,740
No, I've gotten several four Ks since my first one.

863
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,740
I stopped counting them.

864
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,180
I don't know what else to shock up there with Dead by Daylight.

865
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,420
The miracle is a three K on Haddonfield.

866
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh, okay.

867
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Okay.

868
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,420
With pig.

869
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,420
All right.

870
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Had three K.

871
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,420
Yeah.

872
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,220
And I'll tell you the one who won was a David named bear and he wasn't shirtless.

873
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,220
So his name didn't fit him.

874
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,220
Anyway.

875
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,380
Um, you have to have shirtless David.

876
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,380
I'm sorry.

877
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,380
That's just what you have to do.

878
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,260
Um, I also have played Mandalorian finally.

879
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,640
Um, it's pretty fun.

880
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,600
It's got a shaker motor in it and ours shakes a lot, but I kind of don't hate it.

881
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,440
Um, uh, the, the modes in it are really fun.

882
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,040
Um, it's got great sound.

883
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
I, I, I'm going to put this out here.

884
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,560
I do not care for Grogu.

885
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm tired of seeing Grogu every fucking where, and I hate that there's a big fucking massive

886
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,200
one in my game.

887
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,360
They could have just like made a little one in the little pod somewhere and not have this

888
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,640
big thing staring at me.

889
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
I'm sorry.

890
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
He looks like a booger.

891
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,480
Are you going to open up the cabinet and put a little paper bag over his face?

892
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,120
Am I on it, but he's not as, he doesn't offend me as much as the head in fun house.

893
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
Okay.

894
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,120
Oh yeah.

895
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Oh yeah.

896
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
That thing is scary.

897
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,120
Yeah.

898
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,740
I, I, I'm, I'm perfectly fine with the skull and no fear because uh, that was a Steve Ritchie

899
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,740
doing its voice.

900
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,740
That was fine.

901
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:23,420
I, I, but I love when I'm playing of listening to the music and Bobby makes a good point.

902
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,540
Um, he doesn't move and I love that.

903
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,540
So you know he's not going in there.

904
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,900
All right, Brad, his name is not fucking baby Yoda and that pisses me off more than the

905
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,220
character's existence.

906
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,220
Just saying.

907
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,460
It's not even fucking funny.

908
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,700
So yeah, I played that.

909
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:49,020
What I love is that the, the overall theme song plays and the sound effects and the videos

910
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:55,420
that play, they go quite well with, um, the various modes in the game.

911
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:01,180
You know, I, I absolutely, I absolutely love it.

912
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm glad that we traded, uh, monster bash for it.

913
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,740
Um, I didn't care for monster bash that much.

914
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,500
You know, the kind of, you know, B movie monster theme never really just sat with me.

915
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Um, but, uh, oh yeah, Bobby, it was probably me, uh, you know, from 3000 miles away with

916
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
my mind.

917
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
It's wild.

918
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,420
The spotlight that shines on the child fell out of my cab.

919
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,500
Now I see it was dark soccer is doing.

920
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,780
Which also means star soccer.

921
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,340
You can remove it without ruining the game.

922
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,380
Um, uh, it is wild to me that you and Bobby have the same pinball machine now.

923
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,500
It's just, I don't know why.

924
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,020
And mine just happened.

925
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,020
Yeah.

926
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,100
He was talking about it on his show tonight and was showing a B roll of putting it together

927
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
and all this.

928
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,380
Well, you know, as much as you'd like put together one of those things, but kind of

929
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,180
like showing the ins and outs of it, it was, it was neat.

930
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,940
I certainly encourages his, uh, uh, archive broadcast to you guys to check out the machine

931
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
and putting it all together.

932
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,380
Um, yeah, I have the forest and I do, it's interesting to me that you guys have the same

933
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
thing.

934
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
It's just wild.

935
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,900
Um, also I put up a Tik TOK earlier, just, you know, of after my game, just, you know,

936
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,700
basically showing in general what it looks like in my garage.

937
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,460
Um, and I'm going to go ahead and bring this up.

938
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,060
So since I'm doing GISH this month, the grave international scavenger hunt, uh, actually

939
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:24,540
this week, one of our challenges is to have a Mandalorian crossing guard.

940
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,540
And I was just thinking of putting a big stop sign on top of my pinball and submitting that

941
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,540
as a joke.

942
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,980
There you go.

943
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:40,380
I don't know if it'd count, but yeah, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, it's really fun.

944
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,820
It was, it was worth it.

945
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,580
I mean, we weren't going to buy it at first and since the trade happened, we're just completely

946
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,580
down for it.

947
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,580
And yeah, so we have a, we have the pro edition.

948
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,580
Cool.

949
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:58,100
One day, I'll have a pinball machine one day, but I'm also still playing word scapes because

950
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm, I'm addicted to, to words and spelling and all of that stuff.

951
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:13,060
And of course, Fantasian, um, I finally got my, my guys, uh, my team, I'm playing with,

952
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,660
with the guy team right now.

953
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:23,620
So they're all leveled and, um, I beat the intermediary boss who you think is the main

954
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,740
bad guy that isn't.

955
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,660
I've been calling him robot Vincent because he kind of has like that style of Vincent

956
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,180
from final fantasy seven.

957
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,180
Okay.

958
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,940
Um, actually I've been calling him Vomson too, cause his name is Vom.

959
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:45,300
Um, but yeah, I, I've had a great time, uh, with that game and I'm getting on to a bit

960
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,180
further on to the end of the, of the game.

961
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:53,180
And so I'm again, trying to think of what I'm going to do when Fantasian is over.

962
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,780
Um, but there's going to be a Fantasian too.

963
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,620
So I'm looking forward to that eventually coming out on Apple arcade.

964
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,620
Nice.

965
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
Yeah.

966
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,620
All right, Rob, I think you would enjoy it.

967
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,620
It's really fun.

968
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,620
I need to play it at some point.

969
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,120
Um, it's pretty, there's a lot of games I'm juggling.

970
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
That's all I'll get.

971
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,240
Well, like the general fighting and navigating through the game is pretty easy, but those

972
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,540
boss battles, they require some planning.

973
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,540
That's all I'll say about it.

974
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,540
Fair enough.

975
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,900
All right.

976
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,900
Anything else to share?

977
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Um, yeah.

978
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,900
All right.

979
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,780
Um, so for my gaming week, I had a lot of time to play games this week cause, um, and

980
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,700
I think I talked about this on last week's show, but I had a surgery on Wednesday.

981
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,700
So, um, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.

982
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:44,300
And um, I guess, I guess I could, it's, it's, my neck was worked on, so I had that bump

983
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,020
on my neck to remove and just, uh, I'm going to give a content warning.

984
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,480
I am going to turn around and show it it's bandaged.

985
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,980
It shouldn't look too bad, um, but just if that's a woozy thing for you, just avert your

986
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,980
eyes for a moment.

987
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,640
I'll tell you when I'm facing front again, but I'm going to turn around so you can see

988
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,160
it here and, um, you can see it's, it's pretty large.

989
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,840
Um, hold on, sorry.

990
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,320
And I apologize to the podcast listeners cause you can't see this part, but I'm going to

991
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,080
quickly have a moment of silence while I turn around and show you that.

992
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,760
Um, I'll talk.

993
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,560
So Rob has turned around.

994
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:21,320
He's got a big gauze of about maybe two inches, uh, in, uh, width on the back of his neck.

995
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,560
Maybe about one inch in height.

996
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,120
Um, and I turned and I turned back around.

997
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
It's safe now.

998
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,440
I was giving the, the play by play.

999
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
I know.

1000
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
I know.

1001
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
I know.

1002
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
Just for the folks who have read it.

1003
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
But honestly it's not, it's not gross.

1004
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,440
I mean, it's a bandage.

1005
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Yeah.

1006
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,000
So you can't really see under the bandage right now.

1007
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,040
So I'm sure it's still Healey.

1008
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,000
There's at least 10 stitches in there.

1009
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,520
Cause I asked how many stitches did you do?

1010
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,760
And he kind of chuckled and he went at least 10, I will say this.

1011
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,840
It was not a pleasant experience, but honestly, like I, I, it was interesting as we talk about

1012
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,000
all these like traumas and things, I definitely like for like two hours after the surgery,

1013
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,040
I felt completely, I just can't believe I was awake for it because just the whole fact

1014
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:11,800
that I could like feel what, what was happening and like when I, yeah, I, I, in fact even

1015
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,320
trying to describe it now is, is causing me in some sort of way.

1016
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,620
So I'm like, it just, it was a lot, it was very intense.

1017
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,240
And so, um, I, I was just like in shock for like two hours after, uh, thankfully a lot

1018
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,240
of that settled down.

1019
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,960
Um, but I just like just having yourself literally opened up on the table while you're awake.

1020
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,720
Did you tell people what exactly it was that was removed?

1021
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Oh yeah.

1022
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
I had a lipoma.

1023
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,720
Um, yeah.

1024
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,280
So if anyone watches Dr Pimple Popper, it was that I watched lots of lipomas coming

1025
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
out of people.

1026
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,400
I, and see, I can't watch that stuff and especially not my mom's addicted to.

1027
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,920
They actually asked me after they were like, do you want to see it?

1028
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,960
And I, I, I thought for a second, I, I think that was just me.

1029
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,120
I said, no, I don't want to see it.

1030
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,040
So I'll never know what it looked like.

1031
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,560
And I'll tell you this, Rob.

1032
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah.

1033
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,480
Your eyes actually don't look that gross.

1034
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,880
Um, I looked at before I had the surgery when I was looking at the information about it.

1035
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,040
So I did see like what it is, but I, they're like chunky pudding.

1036
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Yeah.

1037
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,040
I didn't want to see it after that.

1038
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,040
So anyway.

1039
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah.

1040
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,800
Um, but the good news is, sorry, I mean, look, here I am.

1041
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
I'm doing the show.

1042
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
I'm back to normal.

1043
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
I feel it back there.

1044
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,920
Um, that's why if you see me touching my neck a lot during the show, it's at that part where

1045
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,000
it's getting a little itchy in that area.

1046
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,080
So I just kind of have to like softly kind of like, I'm itching it, but I'm not really

1047
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,400
itching it type of thing.

1048
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,560
So, uh, because it's going to be, I think they said 10 days before the bandages kind

1049
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,400
of come off naturally and the dissolving stitches and all that.

1050
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,900
Um, so Rob, I'll offer you a suggestion because I've had many a surgery in places that get

1051
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,900
really itchy.

1052
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,900
Yeah.

1053
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:54,560
Um, I have this lotion, um, now it's not cheap, but I have the CeraVe version, but they'll

1054
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,900
often call it like Sarna or something.

1055
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,900
And it's really good for just like stopping an itch.

1056
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,860
But I also was using lidocaine spray, like the, what you spray on the sunburn.

1057
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,340
That is apparently the anesthesia they use too is lidocaine.

1058
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,340
Oh yeah.

1059
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,340
They use lidocaine.

1060
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,740
They just use a much stronger version of it.

1061
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:15,980
But I mean, if you like get the cheapo lidocaine, you know, uh, sun spray stuff, like just get

1062
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,860
one that's like, you know, unscented, plain lidocaine, like the thing is something like

1063
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,220
4% lidocaine in solution.

1064
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,860
But that'll help quite a bit with, with the itchiness and it won't, it won't really hurt

1065
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,860
your stitches.

1066
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,180
I actually think I have some of that aloe vera with lidocaine stuff.

1067
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,940
Um, you want just lidocaine.

1068
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,340
You don't want to put the aloe in it.

1069
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,340
Okay.

1070
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,340
I guess that's good to know.

1071
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,340
Cause I would have went to that.

1072
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,340
Trust me.

1073
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,940
I popped a stitch once.

1074
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,940
It wasn't bad.

1075
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:48,100
I just put like liquid bandage on it and it, cause they had used a skin glue for me, but

1076
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,100
it wasn't bad.

1077
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:55,940
I, I don't know what they used because I swear I felt him tying knots, but they use a dissolving

1078
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,620
stitch and usually cover it with, um, what's it called?

1079
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Skin bond.

1080
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,780
I think that's basically liquid stitches.

1081
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,780
That's what's going on back here.

1082
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,780
Yeah.

1083
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,780
Yeah.

1084
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,860
So anyway, so it's just a much stronger version of the liquid bandage.

1085
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,860
Yeah.

1086
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,860
Anyway.

1087
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,860
Sorry.

1088
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,820
I don't mean to talk about the surgery all night, but, but just, it was seven centimeters

1089
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,820
big is how long the, cause the nice thing about my insurance, you can go on and look

1090
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,820
at all the posts.

1091
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,180
I can go read the post-op notes that I did do because that's just reading.

1092
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,180
There's no pictures.

1093
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,180
We're through the same place, right?

1094
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,180
Yeah.

1095
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,420
Yeah.

1096
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,420
So I love that.

1097
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,420
I absolutely love that.

1098
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,420
Isn't it fascinating?

1099
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,420
Well, yeah.

1100
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,820
And I, you know, I used to work in healthcare on the administrative side of it and I would

1101
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,940
see those types of notes all the time.

1102
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,300
So it's kind of interesting to read them now when they're about you.

1103
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,300
Yeah.

1104
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,300
So anyway, enough of that.

1105
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,300
All right.

1106
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,220
Um, but I, because of all that, I, I mean, I was still kind of working, but, um, kind

1107
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,400
of some short days.

1108
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,280
So I was playing a lot of video games, just kind of relax and recuperate.

1109
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,000
So the game that was really taken up the most of my time that I was playing was Yakuza

1110
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,200
Like a Dragon, which I've talked about previous weeks on this show.

1111
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,040
I am all the way up to goofy.

1112
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
What's that?

1113
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
That game is goofy.

1114
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
It is.

1115
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
It is.

1116
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,040
But it's so, it's so fun.

1117
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,980
Uh, I'm up to chapter 11 now in that game.

1118
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,660
So just to give you some, cause I think the last time I talked about it, I was like chapter

1119
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,660
four or five.

1120
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,360
I'm going to chapter 11 now in the game.

1121
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:20,460
Um, and a lot has happened and I just, I'll say I, I am, the story is so good.

1122
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,420
Like it's like, it's like I'm watching a Netflix show.

1123
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,420
It really is.

1124
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:28,220
Uh, all these chapters could be episodes of a Netflix show and I'm at the point now where

1125
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:35,760
finally little hints that are dropped in the earlier parts of the story are coming back.

1126
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,220
But I love how Yakuza remind you just enough.

1127
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,340
Like it will, it will like, like let's say they're talking about an obscure, I shouldn't

1128
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,620
say obscure, but let's say a character that was around in chapters one and two suddenly

1129
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,180
comes back in chapter 10 or 11.

1130
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,980
You will get like a little flashback where like you get a little photo on the screen

1131
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,280
that shows you that moment from chapter one or two so you can go, Oh yeah, that, you know,

1132
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,780
and for me who has a bad memory to begin with, I need a lot of that stuff and it's really

1133
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,060
good for me to be able to kind of keep along with the story and they do it just enough

1134
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,220
so they're not like hitting you over the head with it.

1135
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,900
Um, which I think is great.

1136
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,100
So yeah, the way they, the way they story tell it, um, is really good.

1137
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,940
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Hey Rob, you should play Yakuza like a dragon.

1138
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,740
I can't believe nobody out there would tell me to play this series.

1139
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,780
Why, why, why would, why would none of you out there say, play Yakuza, play literally

1140
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,980
any of those games, play them.

1141
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,460
No, nobody would do that for me.

1142
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,860
I can't believe it.

1143
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,940
Anyway, I hope you all hear my tongue in cheek cause many of you have said to play this series

1144
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
over the years.

1145
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,140
I finally did it and I'm loving it.

1146
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,900
My one little complaint about the game is that I'm getting to the point where battles

1147
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,900
are feeling very grindy.

1148
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,900
I get it.

1149
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,660
It's a JRPG battles are supposed to be grindy, but because the animations are so over the

1150
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,660
top, because I don't always want to let the computer control things because it's not the

1151
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,780
smartest AI they'll use up my good items.

1152
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:10,580
If I'm not careful, um, I have to kind of sit there and it gets, it gets a little repetitive.

1153
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,380
Um, especially because I just got to a point, I don't want to spoil anything.

1154
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,300
I'll just say the difficulty just went up like a lot.

1155
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,020
Um, and I was, I wasn't ready for it, so I'm having to go back and kind of like grind stuff

1156
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,540
and that part is not very, um, exciting.

1157
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:32,500
Um, but I imagine not, yeah, but the story is so good, it's compelling me enough to push

1158
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
through.

1159
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,940
Um, but I haven't, I like a game like that, but sometimes you have to suffer for your

1160
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,940
enjoyment.

1161
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:43,620
And like, it's, it's also interesting because the main story is very serious and then all

1162
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:49,420
the sub quests are where all the sophomoric potty humor stuff shows up.

1163
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,420
Um, like the, the, the guys dressing up as babies and those sorts, that's all the side

1164
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,420
quest stuff.

1165
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,620
So it's, it's interesting how you literally have comic relief for side quests.

1166
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,660
Uh, it's just, it's interesting to me.

1167
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,660
So, um, so anyway, yes, I recommend the game.

1168
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,660
It's on game pass.

1169
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,700
That's how I finally was like, all right, shut up everybody.

1170
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,380
Cause it's not going to cost me anything outside of what I'm already paying.

1171
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,960
So that's how I finally did it.

1172
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,780
And now I'm like, all right, day one for the seat.

1173
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,460
That's how game pass getcha because now I'm like, all right, day one for the sequel.

1174
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,460
I'm getting it.

1175
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Absolutely.

1176
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,380
Cause the sequel is going to be, uh, going to be fire.

1177
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:29,060
I know that anyway, um, other games I've been playing this week cause it hasn't just been

1178
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,060
about that.

1179
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,660
I've also been playing dead by daylight.

1180
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,660
Here's the weird thing.

1181
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:40,500
I played on PC and I played on Xbox because I needed to get achievements and I was like,

1182
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,580
Oh, my rank on dead by daylight fell all the way back to 20.

1183
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:50,340
This is the best time to do adept achievements because you get match made with all the other

1184
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,960
baby players.

1185
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:57,220
And since I'm on consoles, but I do not have to feel bad one bit if somebody's on the hook

1186
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,260
and I just opened the door and let myself out.

1187
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,260
I don't care.

1188
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,180
Like, you know what?

1189
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,180
Sorry that happened to you.

1190
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:11,160
I was in a match though, where there was a baby nurse killer and the other three were

1191
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:17,700
very clearly a Swift and it was me and these three kept flashlighting the hell out of this

1192
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,700
nurse.

1193
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,100
But because they were doing that, they weren't doing any gens.

1194
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,720
So I'm running from gen to gen and doing it.

1195
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
And you know what?

1196
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,560
Two of them died because all they were doing was hook trading.

1197
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,460
And then one of them got hooked and I was like, you know what?

1198
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,400
When you do clownery, the clown come back to bite.

1199
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,420
And I left like, if you didn't want that clownery, do a gen.

1200
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,060
So I played dead by daylight.

1201
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,820
And then I also played, of course, Final Fantasy 14.

1202
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,820
I've been playing a lot of that.

1203
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:46,780
And then another brand new ish game that I played this week.

1204
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,580
I played flight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator just came out for the Xbox.

1205
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,340
So the Xbox Series X version and Series S version of the game just came out.

1206
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:02,060
Although I dabbled a little bit on PC, I think I said after I played the PC, I can't

1207
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:07,940
wait for the Xbox version because it's going to dumb it down for controllers to a level

1208
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,620
where I'll be able to play it better.

1209
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,460
And I have mixed feedback on that.

1210
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,060
They didn't actually really dumb it down.

1211
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,700
There's still, they packed a lot of stuff into the controller.

1212
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:23,740
So much so that like, I kind of have a hard time without the on-screen instructions and

1213
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,780
stuff to like, still like, you know, do a smooth takeoff and all of that.

1214
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:32,420
But it's very easy to have the AI takeover.

1215
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,060
And there's a very rich tutorial in the game.

1216
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,940
And there's a really cool little mode where you can just go in and there's some certain

1217
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,900
pre-selected areas and pre-selected flights.

1218
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,940
And it's just, okay, it's going to plop you in San Francisco.

1219
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,540
The plane is already in the air and go.

1220
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,540
Now you're taking over the plane.

1221
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,300
You can just explore San Francisco.

1222
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,700
And that's some of the coolest stuff that's in the game.

1223
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,700
I keep saying game.

1224
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,260
There's not really a game here.

1225
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:06,980
I mean, you can kind of make your own game such as I'm going to fly in real time from

1226
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,760
my house to this airport that's a hundred miles away or even further.

1227
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,240
And I'm going to do a real time flight.

1228
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,780
There's not really a game.

1229
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,960
I mean, I guess the lessons kind of make up a game because the later lessons actually

1230
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
have you do that.

1231
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,200
It has you do flights from start to finish.

1232
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,860
So I guess that's the game.

1233
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,640
But I think we can all kind of identify that is a little weak.

1234
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,480
However, it doesn't matter with a game like this.

1235
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:41,280
I really think a lot of this is just like that experience of being able to explore the

1236
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,980
world.

1237
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,980
And it's beautiful.

1238
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,400
Like the graphics in this game are incredible.

1239
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,080
It is 4K and it looks great.

1240
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,220
The very first thing I did in this game was I flew an airplane out of SAC Executive, not

1241
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,480
the international airport, but the executive because it's a little closer.

1242
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,860
And I flew over my house because I wanted to see it.

1243
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,920
And it was really cool, a cool thing to experience.

1244
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:13,220
And yeah, I feel like if you're the type of person that can sit on Google Earth and look

1245
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:19,200
at places far away and go, ooh, or if you like to do like Street View or if you've ever

1246
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,240
played Geo Guesser and you're into that, I feel like Flight Simulator is going to be

1247
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,220
your jam because that's that's what it is.

1248
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,960
It's just putting a new spin on Google Earth, I guess, except it's Bing Earth and making

1249
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,420
it beautiful.

1250
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,120
It's it's great.

1251
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,920
Looking in chat, as Joan Hunter-Matt says, Flight Simulator is so pretty and easier on

1252
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,920
the controller.

1253
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,160
It's still tough because you have to be very precise with your movements.

1254
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,040
Yes, you can't just pull down on the thumb stick to tilt the plane up.

1255
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,040
No, no, no.

1256
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,400
You have to gently, gently push down a little bit to get the right amount of movement.

1257
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,760
So it does challenge some of the conventional video game ways of thinking, that's for sure.

1258
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,680
Bobby Black Wolf says, I stalled trying to fly over Everest.

1259
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,040
I crashed into the Yosemite because I was flying around Yosemite because one of the

1260
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,040
flights is Half Dome.

1261
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,540
You can just start right there.

1262
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,640
And it said that there were like animals on the ground.

1263
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,720
I was trying to get close to the ground because I wanted to see the animals and I crashed

1264
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
the plane.

1265
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,680
I'm only laughing because I think I would do that, too.

1266
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,680
You know what, though?

1267
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,760
I will say it does it in a tasteful way when you crash the plane.

1268
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,080
The music in the game is really good.

1269
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,920
The music soundtrack in the game is very, very good.

1270
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,240
I feel like I'm on Soren at the Disneyland ride.

1271
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,240
I feel like I'm on Soren when I play Flight Simulator.

1272
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,220
But if you crash, there's no explosion or anything graphic.

1273
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,660
It just instantly goes to black and you hear this little like, like a drum beat that goes

1274
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:49,980
doo, doo, doo, doo.

1275
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,980
And it instantly goes to black and just goes, you have sustained critical damage and have

1276
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,240
broken your plane.

1277
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:01,820
And then the music instantly goes sad because you crashed the plane.

1278
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:08,420
So it's very tastefully and artistically done, actually, I will say, because, you know, there's

1279
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:12,820
people out there that are going to be like, oh, I'm going to just, you know, try to crash

1280
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,120
into the airport and see what happens.

1281
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,120
Nothing happened.

1282
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Nothing happened.

1283
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
It's artistic.

1284
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,120
It's artistic.

1285
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,120
This will happen.

1286
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,120
It's done very artfully.

1287
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,120
So, yeah.

1288
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,580
As she says, I did enjoy just flying around places I've lived or been to.

1289
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,580
Yeah.

1290
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,580
I flew around my own town.

1291
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,980
I did the San Francisco thing.

1292
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,940
I flew Vegas at night.

1293
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,060
I thought that would be a fun flight to do.

1294
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:39,820
I flew down because I took one of the little like prop planes practically and flew down

1295
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,680
the strip of Vegas at night.

1296
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,440
And I thought that was a lot of fun.

1297
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,520
Bobby will be proud of me.

1298
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,680
I did Atlanta.

1299
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:51,400
I did a flight at a Hartsfield Jackson and tried to find the Dragon Con hotels and did

1300
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,400
that.

1301
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,920
So that was fun, too.

1302
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,160
And Bobby says, I flew to my college and landed in the state.

1303
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,160
Oh, I did Disneyland.

1304
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,420
I tweeted that one.

1305
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:06,520
So I flew out of John Wayne Airport and tried to find Disneyland, which actually wasn't

1306
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,960
as easy as it sounds because it isn't.

1307
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,560
It does label a lot of points of interest, but probably due to licensing or whatever,

1308
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,840
they don't have Disneyland as a point of interest.

1309
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,300
You can find the town of Anaheim.

1310
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,760
But as we all know, even though Disneyland is in the town of Anaheim, there's a lot more.

1311
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,200
So I had to kind of find it.

1312
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,040
I kind of had to go, OK, there's the freeway.

1313
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,360
You just have to go down five.

1314
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,020
Yeah, but which of these freeways is five?

1315
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,200
It takes you a minute to kind of find that, right?

1316
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,560
And then I was like, OK, I found it.

1317
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,680
And there's a lot of trees, which because I would have thought, oh, you just look for

1318
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,680
the Matterhorn and that's how you find Disneyland because that's what you do when you're in

1319
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,680
the car, right?

1320
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,760
You find the Matterhorn.

1321
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,040
But when you're up in the air that high, the Matterhorn doesn't really stick out because

1322
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,400
you're really high up.

1323
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,400
So anyway.

1324
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,400
Yeah.

1325
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
Yeah.

1326
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,320
S.J. 100 Matt says, I flew around New York City and that was a lot of fun, although I

1327
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,840
noticed they didn't include the Freedom Tower.

1328
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,600
I did notice the imagery is a couple of years old.

1329
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:10,200
So to use a local example, sorry, but for Dark Soccer's benefit, I found you can actually

1330
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,800
fly out of a grass field in Clarksburg.

1331
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,360
I thought that was kind of cool.

1332
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,360
So I did.

1333
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah, I did a flight from there to like downtown.

1334
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,680
But I noticed as I was flying up five, I was like, OK, there's the Sacramento Tower and

1335
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,640
that, oh, the Delta Shores isn't there.

1336
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,940
So the whole Delta Shores isn't there.

1337
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,120
It's just an empty.

1338
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:33,200
It looks like it's been like like a lot that's being prepped for something.

1339
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,720
But that's all that's there.

1340
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
And the early days.

1341
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,800
That's a big shopping complex here locally in the area that's been open.

1342
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,200
It's been around probably two, three years at this point, but it's not in the imagery.

1343
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,160
So it is a little bit dated.

1344
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:52,120
But I did find you can go into the DLC and there's all sorts of like free stuff.

1345
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,720
I guess they're user mods.

1346
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:59,120
And there was some U.S. update thing that was like four gigs that said it would update

1347
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,760
like 40 airports and certain landmarks.

1348
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,240
So I downloaded that.

1349
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,660
So I wonder if there isn't like other stuff that might update the OK.

1350
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,660
Bobby Lockwood says the U.S. world update is from Microsoft.

1351
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,680
So I did grab that for what it's worth.

1352
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,040
And Bobby says the satellite imagery is old.

1353
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,780
The Georgia Dome is there and the Mercedes Benz Stadium is still dirt and Turner Field

1354
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,560
is still the baseball stadium and Truist Park is woodland.

1355
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,080
That means nothing to me.

1356
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,060
But for those of you local in that area, it gives you an idea.

1357
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,060
But that's OK.

1358
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:35,140
I don't mind that the imagery is slightly old because it's it's enough close enough.

1359
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:43,340
So, yeah, I just again, if you are a Google Earth or geoguessr or I'm exploring a town

1360
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,440
in street view because it's fun type of thing, like it's a very specific type of nerdom.

1361
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,340
And I am very much into that flight simulator is absolutely for you.

1362
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:55,780
But I do think there's some people that are going to go, wow, I just downloaded 100 gig

1363
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:56,780
game.

1364
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,720
That's not even a game.

1365
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,320
I hate to say flight simulator is probably not for you, but I think it's still worth

1366
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,320
checking out.

1367
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,440
Just just if you want an impressive piece of graphical thing for your Xbox Series X,

1368
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,440
do it.

1369
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,440
No.

1370
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,440
All right.

1371
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,440
All right.

1372
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,440
Well, I can't do it.

1373
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,800
Well, no, not not yet.

1374
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,800
Some days.

1375
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,120
Well, yeah, you don't even really have because you're doing everything on Mac.

1376
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,360
But I'm almost positive this will be on Microsoft Cloud.

1377
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:34,840
So in the future, you could maybe maybe Stadia might do something that be nice.

1378
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,020
It's a Microsoft first party title.

1379
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,020
So they'll probably.

1380
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,020
I'm not going to.

1381
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,020
Yeah, I get anything.

1382
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,020
And you too.

1383
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,020
I get it.

1384
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,020
All right.

1385
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,240
OK, so that's it for my gaming week.

1386
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,960
Oh, I guess I should get in just a couple of quick housekeeping things and then we'll

1387
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,960
get into the news that's going on tonight.

1388
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,820
So just a couple of quick things.

1389
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:57,000
So the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is coming up and it's the weekend of August 20th.

1390
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,240
If I remember correctly, that is in the Atlanta metro area.

1391
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,520
Vogue Network is sponsoring that.

1392
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,800
And Bobby Black Wolf will be there.

1393
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,720
I will not be, unfortunately.

1394
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,960
So if you're in the area and you feel OK to do that because I realize this is a weird

1395
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,000
year and all that stuff.

1396
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,080
So everybody has to make their own choice of that.

1397
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,640
So we're going to do we're going to do a low pressure ad this time.

1398
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,180
I'm just going to let you know it's a thing that's happening.

1399
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,240
If you'd like to go, great.

1400
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,720
And you can check out their website for all the updated health policies and things of

1401
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,800
that nature so you can see if it's something you would be interested in.

1402
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,200
Another convention also in the Atlanta area that we will be at, I will be at as well as

1403
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,280
Bobby Black Wolf is Dragon Con.

1404
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,960
Dragon Con is coming up over Labor Day weekend.

1405
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,080
And the policies for that did come out today.

1406
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,480
And so I am very relieved to see that they will be mandating masks for everybody, regardless

1407
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,680
of vaccination status.

1408
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,520
And they did cap the attendance at half, basically, of what they had in prior years.

1409
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,240
So I'm so glad I didn't bother.

1410
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,260
I understand, you know, everybody's got to make their own call.

1411
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,680
But for me, I'm ready.

1412
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:07,040
So and I'm going to be doing six panels throughout the weekend.

1413
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:13,880
So it's going to be a different year, but that's part of the uniqueness of it, I think.

1414
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,400
So, yeah, I haven't traveled in a long time.

1415
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,080
So it'll be it'll be nice to do that.

1416
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,520
So that'll be over Labor Day weekend.

1417
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,960
So if you happen to be going, please say hi.

1418
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,760
If you need six feet of space, I completely understand.

1419
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,880
All right.

1420
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,880
That's it.

1421
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,740
I guess we can get into some gaming news now.

1422
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:33,740
So let's do it.

1423
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,740
All right.

1424
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,740
All right.

1425
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,280
I'm going to start off tonight and I will talk about the PlayStation 5 system software

1426
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,280
update.

1427
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,140
So there is a new beta version of PlayStation 5 system software.

1428
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:49,640
And the big thing about this software updated is actually expanding SSD support.

1429
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,720
So if you're in the PlayStation 5 beta program, so they actually have like a beta interface

1430
01:12:53,720 --> 01:13:02,520
program, this new software beta 2.0-04 is .0000, that is rolling out to folks.

1431
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,720
And this is where you're going to be able to use your own M.2 SSD into the PlayStation

1432
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,600
5 expansion slot.

1433
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,880
And you can use it for additional storage, which, you know, a lot of people have been

1434
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,480
complaining about PlayStation 5 and Xbox, quite frankly, is that there's not enough

1435
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,640
storage for all these games now that there are 100 gigs like Flight Simulator, right?

1436
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,580
We need more storage.

1437
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:30,040
So excuse me, this PlayStation update is going to address that a little bit.

1438
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,320
However, there are some specifics to this.

1439
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,600
You can't just use any drive.

1440
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,720
I would direct you to PlayStation's website to read a little more on this because I can

1441
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:46,620
say it, but I don't, you know, for example, you have to use a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDS with a

1442
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,240
capacity of 250 gigabyte minimum and four terabyte maximum.

1443
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,960
Okay, maybe you caught all that, but I bet you didn't.

1444
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:59,160
So you want to probably go look up the specs before you buy a drive to use with this.

1445
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,440
And of course, you want to make, don't, don't, don't plug one of these in with the power

1446
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
on.

1447
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,740
Turn, turn the power off, then do it.

1448
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:11,840
Some other updates, 3D audio through the TV speakers.

1449
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,200
And then there's also some in the home screen for games.

1450
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,400
If you have different platform versions of the same game installed, they appear separately

1451
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,180
on your home screen.

1452
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:25,240
So different versions of a game are easier to spot.

1453
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,200
An icon will show you if it's PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4.

1454
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,160
That should help with some of the issues where people were saying, I was launching the wrong

1455
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
version of the game.

1456
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,880
I was trying to play No Man's Sky and it kept launching the PS4 version of the game, which

1457
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,400
is great if I want to do VR, but otherwise I don't need it.

1458
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,580
So they're separating that out a little bit.

1459
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:48,060
And there's some other features as well, you know, some trophy things and so forth.

1460
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,920
So check that out.

1461
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,720
If you're in the beta program, if you're not in the beta program, then good news.

1462
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:57,020
Other people are testing that for you and you will get that update very soon.

1463
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,180
It sounds like, I would guess probably in a month or so.

1464
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,100
So check that out when it comes out.

1465
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:08,820
Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 5 just yet, but that might be something that I get in

1466
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:09,820
a few more months.

1467
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,140
I was thinking maybe this holiday, but it might, thanks to this upcoming story Dark

1468
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:19,700
Sakura is about to bring us, now I'm like, maybe I could just wait till spring next year.

1469
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,700
We'll see.

1470
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,180
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1471
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:29,520
So a lot of people have been looking forward to Horizon Forbidden West as supposed to be

1472
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,900
coming out on PS5.

1473
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:35,860
Well, they're going to have to keep looking forward to it because it has been delayed

1474
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:40,220
until first quarter 2022.

1475
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:46,560
Before it was actually set to be a holiday release, I said that it's just part of a number

1476
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,400
of delays that have been completely across the industry, including a few other games

1477
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,380
like God of War.

1478
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:02,900
They're saying that it's due to COVID-19 causing production challenges, having developers work

1479
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:12,940
from home, but also that it's just been bumping the games for just completely other reasons

1480
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,940
as well.

1481
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,260
So they're still working on it.

1482
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,600
They're just behind.

1483
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:24,440
I feel like we need a little card that we flip to here on the show, the little B roll

1484
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:29,420
or whatever with a picture of Miyamoto that says that little quote, the bad game is bad

1485
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:33,340
forever and nobody will forget that you delayed a good game.

1486
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:39,700
I feel like this needs to be on standby because, you know, apply it in this particular case.

1487
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:45,100
But I mean, also at the same time, like I get it, not only has the COVID pandemic made

1488
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:49,580
making games that were a very collaborative thing before a little bit harder, but I think

1489
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:56,260
probably what's also coming into play here is that most folks reasonably thought once

1490
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:03,100
vaccines were available, the pandemic would start to subside.

1491
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,700
Now I'm just going to leave it at that.

1492
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,980
You all can fill in the blank.

1493
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,580
We all know, but that is not what happened.

1494
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:12,160
And we all know why that didn't happen.

1495
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,780
And we're just going to leave it at that for now.

1496
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:20,940
And my point is that I bet a lot of these project plans that kind of thought about how

1497
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:26,860
are we going to get the game done by Christmas or, you know, the holiday and all this stuff?

1498
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,580
How are we going to get the game done by then?

1499
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,580
Probably involved.

1500
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:35,460
Well, the good news is we'll be back in the office in June and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1501
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,460
Yeah.

1502
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,460
Cue the clown.

1503
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,940
Cue the clown car music.

1504
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:42,620
We thought we thought.

1505
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,620
You know what?

1506
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,620
Hmm.

1507
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,620
They might.

1508
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:50,920
We were supposed to go back to our offices next month and they've delayed us to an unspecified

1509
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,260
time.

1510
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,720
So we, I'm not surprised.

1511
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,360
We were going to have the office open optionally on Monday.

1512
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,440
Some people are like, like male staff and stuff like that.

1513
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,400
Some people have to be there and have been here that there that whole time.

1514
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,280
But it's a very minimal staff that's very spread out massed as you can imagine.

1515
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,240
They were going to open it up to others who wanted to go in.

1516
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,440
Like I, I, I, that's what we're like.

1517
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
Yeah.

1518
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
They were going to do that on Monday.

1519
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,880
They've actually said no, we're not even going to give that option.

1520
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,920
They've now scaled it back to, you can make an appointment to go get your shit that you

1521
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,160
haven't been able to get since March of 2020.

1522
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,480
And that's about all we're going to do right now.

1523
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:40,040
And with no specification of when it'll be even just be open to like, I want to, I just

1524
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,560
want to not be at home for a day.

1525
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,920
Like I want to go into the, of which there's a lot of people in that category right now,

1526
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,400
but not going to happen tomorrow.

1527
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,400
So yeah.

1528
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:59,400
Um, honestly, I think everyone was thinking way too, uh, too, what's the word I'm thinking

1529
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,080
of optimistically?

1530
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,760
I think, I think with these, um, Delta variant stuff, yeah, it's going to get, it's going

1531
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,200
to get, uh, for the people who didn't get vaccinated, uh, or can I feel, I feel bad

1532
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,320
for the people that can't, because there are a very small set of very small set of people

1533
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:22,880
that due to other ongoing treatments or certain immunocompositions comp, compromises, can't

1534
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,760
get immunized.

1535
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,200
And I feel really bad for those people.

1536
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,200
Really bad.

1537
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,200
Yeah.

1538
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:35,600
So, um, anyway, Pele Hanumea in chat says, uh, don't wait a hundred hours in the PS Valhalla

1539
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:41,480
PS five Valhalla, still OMG on how beautiful in 4k on my QLED and really fast load times.

1540
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,800
So for what it's worth, I do have Xbox series X.

1541
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,240
So most of those cross-platform things, um, I I'm, I'm just playing on series X.

1542
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:55,200
Um, however, I do realize Sony has their own games.

1543
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,120
I need to play at some point, including the one dark soccer just mentioned this story

1544
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:05,640
says, okay, you have a little bit longer and absolutely by the time final fantasy 16 is

1545
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,880
out, you know, I'm going to have, I will, I will not miss final fantasy 16 period.

1546
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:14,560
I I'm at the point where, you know, thanks to the pandemic and us not taking vacations,

1547
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,200
I will probably take two or three days of vacation when final fantasy 16 comes out because

1548
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,200
I'm an adult.

1549
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,760
I'm an adult.

1550
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,200
Exactly.

1551
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
All right.

1552
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,920
Pod culture and chat says Delta is rough, but what the fuck is Epsilon going to be like?

1553
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,600
They're already up to iota iota iota is where they're up to.

1554
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,240
Actually, um, some of the variants of concerns have different concerns other than

1555
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,240
they're more transmissible.

1556
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,720
So we haven't heard about them as much because they're more isolated to certain parts of

1557
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,720
the globe.

1558
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,080
But the good news is vaccines have proven some sort of effectiveness, certainly keeping

1559
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:01,880
you out of the hospital on all of them, unless you're like over the age of 80, uh, or have

1560
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,240
other, you know, like I said, the immunocompromised and those issues going on, uh, that, that,

1561
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:11,440
uh, it is even then it's a very, very, very, very, very small amount and the media does

1562
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:17,880
kind of fixate too much on that small amount, um, that are vaccinated and still have those

1563
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,360
types of problems because the vast majority of vaccinated people not having problems.

1564
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,360
Yeah.

1565
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,360
Yeah.

1566
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:30,640
Even so though, and it's officially out that you can be vaccinated and you can still get

1567
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,640
it.

1568
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,640
Yep.

1569
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:40,880
So I'm just like, uh, yeah, um, no, I'm going to remain a hermit.

1570
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,880
Let's see.

1571
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,080
Uh, looking at the other chat, uh, pod culture and chat says, I hear a kitty.

1572
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,080
Is it Smush or Midna?

1573
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,080
It's Smush.

1574
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,080
Sorry.

1575
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,080
I don't know what he's on about.

1576
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,840
Midna's voice is quite a bit different too, so, um, daddy took, other daddy took a Costco

1577
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,840
trip today.

1578
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,840
So Smush is probably seeing something that came back from Costco and it's probably going

1579
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,840
crazy about it.

1580
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,400
So there is that, um, all right, well, let's move on.

1581
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,280
Uh, I brought up Final Fantasy.

1582
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,280
So let's talk about Final Fantasy 14.

1583
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,280
This is interesting.

1584
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,240
I, I, I, I learned some things this week because of this story, y'all know, I love Final Fantasy

1585
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,240
14.

1586
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,240
I play too much of it and I'm really, I'm really excited for the next expansion.

1587
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,780
Endwalker is going to be coming out and Endwalker is going to be bringing two new jobs to it.

1588
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:33,240
The Sage class and the Reaper class and Final Fantasy 14 kind of has these iconic job, literally

1589
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:38,040
iconic job icons that go with the different classes in the game.

1590
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,800
In fact, some people, some people go so far as to get these tattooed on themselves.

1591
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,520
Um, but a lot of people have them like with bumper stickers on their car or patches on

1592
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,280
their backpack and that sort of thing.

1593
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,920
These icons that represent the job classes that they play.

1594
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,520
Well, if you started to make some of the, that gear for, um, Endwalker, you're going

1595
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,720
to have to change it a little bit because it turns out they have changed the Sage icon,

1596
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,220
uh, for Final Fantasy 14.

1597
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,300
But it's very interesting the why behind this.

1598
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:12,640
They actually went so far, Naoki Yoshida, uh, being they in this case, actually wrote

1599
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,780
a, uh, another letter, uh, which he's been doing a lot lately, um, addressing like, you

1600
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:21,340
know, cause I just talked about this last week, the increased player base in the game.

1601
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,220
He kind of wrote a letter about that and the challenges they were having.

1602
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:30,060
Um, he wrote another letter, uh, about the slight change in the icon for the Sage class.

1603
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:36,060
Um, so they have changed it a little bit so that now some of the, so the Sage uses this

1604
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,980
weapon that's kind of like, um, like these little darts that fly through the air sort

1605
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,980
of thing.

1606
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:46,620
And the way it was represented were these four little darts, excuse me, with little

1607
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,700
holes in the top of them.

1608
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:56,100
But the way they were put together was actually making some folks a little bit anxious because

1609
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,280
of tripe, trypophobia.

1610
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,500
I think it's called where trypophobia is basically if you see clusters of holes.

1611
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,700
So things like, and again, I apologize if I'm talking about things that are going to

1612
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,740
give you the heebie jeebies, but please understand I'm trying to be educational.

1613
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:17,100
Like I got this week, things like honeycombs, right?

1614
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:24,100
That can give people the heebie jeebies because they it's, it's that the holes together.

1615
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,700
And I actually never even really knew that this was a thing.

1616
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:31,900
So but, but because I also tweeted about it and I actually got a response where somebody,

1617
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,700
I think a couple of them actually, where somebody was like, yeah, this is me.

1618
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,420
And you know, I'm glad, I'm glad he did this.

1619
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,140
So and they, he changed, they changed, oh he, the team changed the icon.

1620
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,260
So now they're not all like lined up.

1621
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,100
They're kind of like tilted in a little bit and the holes in three of them are filled

1622
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,100
in.

1623
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,100
So they just, they look a little, it looks a little different now.

1624
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,500
I think it's a very subtle change, but you know, there were the trolls that came out

1625
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,180
and said, the old one looked better.

1626
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:07,820
You know, the old, I already had stuff made up for the old one, whatever, get over it.

1627
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:11,140
You could live in your special little snowflake cloud and all that stuff.

1628
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,140
Congratulations.

1629
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,460
You know, no one cares.

1630
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,460
It's that Jurassic Park meme where, look, look at this guy.

1631
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,460
Look, nobody cares.

1632
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,620
But you know, the old no one cur.

1633
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,620
Yeah.

1634
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,780
But you know, she, and again, distress.

1635
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:26,540
I'm saying that to the people that are like the old one was better.

1636
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,260
I'm not saying that to the people that had, which I never realized was the thing.

1637
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,900
And now I learned, I was like, oh, okay, well that's neat.

1638
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:39,380
You know, Final Fantasy XIV has really made a name for itself in how accessible it is.

1639
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,960
It's won awards for its accessibility.

1640
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,860
And when you see Yoshi P write a letter like this, explaining what they, basically saying

1641
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,660
this aversion, in the letter, this aversion is known as trypophobia and those who have

1642
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:55,740
it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps.

1643
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:04,180
Like having a producer of a game explain that it's like, okay, you get what, to tie

1644
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:07,900
this to the Activision Blizzard thing a little bit, I'm sorry, but I have to, and I'm not

1645
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,340
pitting XIV against wow.

1646
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,140
That's not what I'm doing.

1647
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,780
However, what did I say with that whole thing and other things like it?

1648
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:22,840
The culture is defined by the management, right?

1649
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,840
And you hear about what's going on that we all talked about at the beginning of the show

1650
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,540
and gross, disgusting, et cetera, and all this.

1651
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:34,280
But then you look at Naoki Yoshida and you got to say, now here's a man who deserves

1652
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,680
a gold star.

1653
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,880
Here's a man who doesn't just get one piece of glitter.

1654
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,040
Here's a man who gets the whole star because he acknowledges it.

1655
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,160
He explains it.

1656
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,860
And he says, you know what, we need to, sorry.

1657
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:46,860
You know what?

1658
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:47,860
It was brought to my attention.

1659
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,760
I think we can change this without like changing the meaning behind it, all this stuff and,

1660
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,880
and make, you know, make this a little better for some people.

1661
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,600
And he walks that fucking walk.

1662
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,840
And you know what?

1663
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,000
His game is reaping the benefits now.

1664
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,680
And I say, well deserved.

1665
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,520
And I don't just say that as a fanboy of Final Fantasy XIV.

1666
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:14,200
I say that as a Naoki Yoshida is a great person.

1667
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Let's see.

1668
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,240
Dejirama S in chat says certain forms of trypophobia get me, so I'm lucky.

1669
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,720
I just didn't know this was a thing.

1670
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,160
That Tigerclaw points out even strawberries can cause it.

1671
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,160
Yeah.

1672
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,160
I saw that in some of the articles.

1673
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,160
Yup.

1674
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,160
Yup.

1675
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
Yup.

1676
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,160
Fifth Dream says Yoshi P is just a wholesome dude.

1677
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Pod culture brings that.

1678
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,160
And you know what?

1679
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,160
Somebody in Discord had said this too.

1680
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,420
I don't know if it's Tigerclaw or what, but was talking about the Xbox Series X.

1681
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,900
And if you look at the top of a Series X, it has all those holes in it.

1682
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,080
It's for ventilation.

1683
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,480
I get the logic behind it, but some sites were running an article about how the Xbox

1684
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:53,640
Series X was causing some people issues because of its design.

1685
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,400
And it's the same thing that's playing into that, which is very interesting.

1686
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,180
Very, very, very, very interesting.

1687
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,180
So yeah.

1688
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:04,340
And SG100 Matt says it's great when devs listen to their communities and are transparent

1689
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:05,340
about it.

1690
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,340
Yeah.

1691
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:10,980
So, you know, and he's not, it's not like he's changing the entire game.

1692
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:16,080
He's just, he's changing a thing where he's like, this is an easy fix to like not give

1693
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,000
certain people anxiety and we can still have the same artistic vision.

1694
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,200
I'm just going to change it.

1695
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Cool.

1696
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,000
That's like, that's a great attitude.

1697
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,360
We need more of that anyway.

1698
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:34,840
So anyway, a big gold star, a golden hug for you, Yoshida.

1699
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,840
You're a good person.

1700
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,840
All right.

1701
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,840
For sure.

1702
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,400
That's another reason why I will, I will, I will plunk down that money day one for Final

1703
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,800
Fantasy 16 with him on the team.

1704
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,920
How can it be bad?

1705
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:54,440
Famous last words, but you know what, even, even if it's a bad game, I'll still, which

1706
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,440
I doubt it will be, but even if it's a, even if it's on the lower end of Final Fantasy

1707
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,000
games or whatever, I will still say, you know what?

1708
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,560
I supported a great team.

1709
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,800
All right.

1710
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
Indeed.

1711
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,800
Let's move on.

1712
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Dark Sakura.

1713
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,720
So how about boring financial stuff?

1714
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,720
My favorite.

1715
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,720
Right.

1716
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:18,160
But this is actually very notable.

1717
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:28,040
Basically the video game industry has taken a really big amount of business in the terms

1718
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:32,560
of mergers and acquisitions.

1719
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,840
Basically record investment ratings in the second quarter.

1720
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,680
So this is going on the, well, the numbers, just to put it this way.

1721
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:50,840
There is a $18.2 billion in mergers and acquisitions and 7.4 billion in investments.

1722
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:59,280
So because the market has been so strong in the wake of the pandemic that, you know, and

1723
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,000
we're seeing the results, we're seeing these companies do buyouts, we're seeing, you know,

1724
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
like one of them, there was an iron source and plays studios.

1725
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:20,560
There was a EA purchasing a glue mobile, gearbox being acquired, you know, and just so many

1726
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,560
things going on.

1727
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:30,800
We're hearing more and more like the biggest one was Epic games doing a $1 billion late

1728
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,800
stage.

1729
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,680
I mean, of course this is, Epic has also been in other issues going on that could affect

1730
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:44,160
them financially that I'm not supposed to talk about.

1731
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:49,280
But I mean, we're seeing more and more of this happening.

1732
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:57,420
And now what I wonder is that how the recent executive order is going to affect further

1733
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,800
mergers and acquisitions.

1734
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,700
I mean, I'm glad to see the investment happen.

1735
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:08,840
I'm glad to see, you know, I'm glad to see the industry grow, but I don't want it to

1736
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,240
grow at the expense of a fair competition, right?

1737
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,920
You know, if we're gonna have to live in a capitalist society, you may as well cut out

1738
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,920
the monopoly.

1739
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,920
Absolutely.

1740
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,920
Makes sense.

1741
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,920
Yeah.

1742
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,200
And you know, what's interesting is that we see a lot of like up and coming, you know,

1743
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,160
It's interesting because I feel like every time there's a merger, there's people that

1744
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,800
inevitably leave the company because of the merger and then start up their own studio.

1745
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,400
And then it's a weird game that's played in the gaming industry is in like these new studios

1746
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,720
start to come up and some of them end up getting bought, but not all of them do, you know?

1747
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,520
And I think about a lot of developers, you know, again, thinking of the big story this

1748
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,680
week about how probably there were a lot of people that left those companies because of

1749
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,680
those cultures.

1750
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,520
And I'm not just picking on the one we were talking about earlier, but a lot of the AAA

1751
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,100
companies and started their own studios and why we have like some really cool companies

1752
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:11,480
out there that, you know, like I think of like super giant games and a game like Hades

1753
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:15,760
and just like everything that kind of came out of that game and everything is like, I

1754
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,520
don't know if that studio in particular was started by like disgruntled former employees

1755
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,520
to it.

1756
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,600
But it's nice to hear about like these smaller studios kind of coming up and doing taking

1757
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,040
a different approach to games that oftentimes pays off very, very well.

1758
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,040
Yeah.

1759
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:35,160
But you know that the cycle is going to continue, you know, eventually they're going to be popular.

1760
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:41,040
They're going to get bought, you know, it's a big cycle that needs to be be broken.

1761
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:47,300
And I'm really curious to see what happens with the with this executive order.

1762
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:52,280
I want to see that when everything is going into place, I want to see what these results

1763
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,280
are.

1764
01:32:53,280 --> 01:33:02,320
I really think that we're going to start having a bigger sort of thinking of not necessarily

1765
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:09,520
that they're all affected as much, but I want to see there be maybe a little bit more equilibrium

1766
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,520
in the industry.

1767
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:11,520
I gotcha.

1768
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,520
I gotcha.

1769
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,800
So even though you say, hey, woo, video game investment, I think this is something where

1770
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,880
it's like, oh, this this this trickles down to the types of games that end up getting

1771
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,200
made.

1772
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,200
So right.

1773
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Big news.

1774
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:30,200
Not necessarily trickle down financially because no, not that, but, you know, screw

1775
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,200
you, Reagan.

1776
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
All right.

1777
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,200
Moving on.

1778
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,880
Let's let's talk about kitties.

1779
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,720
Let's talk about a game about kitties.

1780
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,720
Yay.

1781
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,540
Kitties are the best.

1782
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,540
Maybe that's why Mr. Smoosh came.

1783
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,540
Oh, he left.

1784
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,540
I just looked over to where he was sitting.

1785
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,540
He left.

1786
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:45,540
Never mind.

1787
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:46,880
He didn't come in for the cat story.

1788
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,780
But one game that I don't know about you, but it definitely caught my attention when

1789
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,160
it was shown at one of these advertised a while back.

1790
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,760
It was it was at the early PlayStation five showcase.

1791
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,160
I want to say it was actually their announcement showcase.

1792
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:03,320
They showed this game called Stray, which was all we really knew at the time is it's

1793
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,840
a game about cats.

1794
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,740
And that's kind of all we still know.

1795
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,920
It's a cat simulator.

1796
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:09,920
It's called Stray.

1797
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,520
But we know when it's coming out, it is coming out in early 2022 and it's going to be coming

1798
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,960
out for the PC and it's going to be coming out for the PlayStation.

1799
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,720
And if you want to see more about the game, a gameplay walkthrough just came out this

1800
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,720
week.

1801
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:29,080
So that is actually something you can look at to get a little more sense about what the

1802
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,720
game really is and so forth.

1803
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,720
So sorry, I brought it up.

1804
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,080
I want to see a little bit of it on this computer over here.

1805
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:41,460
But you do play as a cat who ends up getting injured and separated from his family.

1806
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:47,280
So you use your physical abilities to navigate the environment and solve puzzles partway

1807
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,400
through the adventure.

1808
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:54,200
You meet a drone and then they that drone will let you converse with other robots in

1809
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,080
the city and interact with objects in the environment.

1810
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,520
So that's kind of interesting.

1811
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,520
You can.

1812
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,240
You can also do fun cat things, scratch furniture, which we all knock shit off.

1813
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,240
It has to.

1814
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,080
You can interact with vending machines.

1815
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,440
You can rub up against the legs of robots that you meet.

1816
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,520
Nothing yet about knocking shit over.

1817
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,720
But how can how can that not be involved?

1818
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,440
Yeah, there's got to be asshole cat mode.

1819
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,440
There's got to be.

1820
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:25,200
Well, don't forget, there's that game on itch.io that was actually it's not called Asshole

1821
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,200
Cat, is it?

1822
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,920
But basically, that's what you are a cat and you play an asshole cat.

1823
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,080
There was cat lateral damage.

1824
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,080
That's it.

1825
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,080
Cat lateral damage.

1826
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,080
That's it.

1827
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,080
Yeah.

1828
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,080
Like it's not called Asshole Cat.

1829
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,080
You know what I'm mixing it up with?

1830
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,600
I'm mixing it up with Untitled Goose Game, because the reason that is called Untitled

1831
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,600
Goose Game is because that game was called Asshole Goose or something like that in the

1832
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,600
beginning.

1833
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,600
Yeah.

1834
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,600
And they obviously cannot release a game on intended.

1835
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,920
Like, you can't release a game called Pixel Shits.

1836
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,800
So it's called Pixel Poops will get asshole goose became Untitled Goose Game.

1837
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:04,320
So anyway, the goose is a big dick.

1838
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,520
The fifth dream came up with that.

1839
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,760
We have cat lateral damage for knocking shit over.

1840
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,760
Yes.

1841
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,440
And Matt says there is some platforming stuff where you have to knock things over.

1842
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,440
Good.

1843
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,440
Good.

1844
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,160
Pod Culture brings up President Stray, the game.

1845
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,360
You know what?

1846
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,720
This is as good as this is as good as it's going to get for President Cat.

1847
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,720
I'll take it.

1848
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:24,720
You know what?

1849
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,720
President Cat.

1850
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:30,000
That news is so 2008, I'll say it.

1851
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,080
At least we're now in the year in the year 2021, we're finally getting a fucking cat

1852
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,080
game.

1853
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,080
I'm excited.

1854
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,080
All right.

1855
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,080
Good lord.

1856
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,400
I'm excited about Stray.

1857
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,400
All right.

1858
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,400
Yeah.

1859
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:48,080
Let's get let's let's get into a time where not all games are about cats with our next

1860
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,080
segment.

1861
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:05,560
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1862
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,560
out a classic and tell you about it.

1863
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,040
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1864
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,760
And what did you pick for us this week, Arsaka?

1865
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:20,200
I picked an arcade game called Lucky and Wild.

1866
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,520
I have talked about.

1867
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,920
We always talk about this game.

1868
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,360
How has this not been a classic game?

1869
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,360
All right.

1870
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,920
I went to look and I was like, you know, we brought this game up before, but have we actually

1871
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,920
done it?

1872
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:31,920
And yeah.

1873
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,240
So it's time.

1874
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,120
It is time.

1875
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:43,600
So Lucky and Wild is a first person racing slash shooter game that was released by Namco

1876
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,640
in 1993, ran on the Namco System 2 hardware.

1877
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:57,200
And it's a throwback to you remember the movie Tango and Cash?

1878
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,200
I do.

1879
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,200
Just to give you a heads up, I'm going AFK a quick second bio break.

1880
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,200
OK.

1881
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:07,920
So it has quite a, you know, it also pulls a little bit from Starsky and Hutch as well.

1882
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:18,360
So the the way the first person, the first player is called Lucky, who's this debonair

1883
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:25,860
guy in a business suit who was named after who was modeled after Starsky and Tango.

1884
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:31,480
And he asked to drive the car, accelerate, you know, basically do all that and shoot

1885
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,880
with a light gun.

1886
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,480
The second character is called Wild, who is kind of like a surfer guy with the long hair.

1887
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,920
And he's modeled after Hutch and Cash.

1888
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,000
And he shoots with just a second light gun.

1889
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,720
So he doesn't have he doesn't have to drive.

1890
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,960
I mean, lazy, lazy butthole.

1891
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:56,960
Anyway, you have to help the two of them catch six suspects by the names of Jerky, Gambit,

1892
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,440
Juliora, Heel, Bear and Big Cigar himself.

1893
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,400
So you go through the stages.

1894
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:10,540
You have to fire at enemy cars, destroy their henchmen as well as the cars, stop the projectiles

1895
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:14,880
that are fired at you, the usual for a shooting game.

1896
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:20,200
When you catch up to the suspect, you have to continuously fire until its energy is depleted

1897
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,440
and then you will capture the suspect and get a reward.

1898
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:30,960
If the the timer runs out, the suspect will escape and you'll see the text got away appearing

1899
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,740
on the screen.

1900
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:39,940
So after each stage, Lucky and Wild drive to the pink cat's garage to get their car

1901
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:47,600
repaired and they'll be entertained by young women wearing cattails and ears.

1902
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,840
Yeah.

1903
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,480
So yeah, sexism in the industry.

1904
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:59,040
Anyway, so there are a few different ways that you can play the game.

1905
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,260
So one player can drive and another one can shoot.

1906
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:12,320
One player can drive with someone else on the gun and someone else on the other gun.

1907
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:15,560
One player can drive with another one manning both guns.

1908
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,880
One player driving.

1909
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,840
You've got all kinds of like different ways that you can do this or you can have somebody

1910
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,800
doing both of the guns while driving.

1911
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:32,440
Although Namco has never actually put out, though, an official that lets the three people

1912
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:36,480
play simultaneously, but people would do it and I've seen it happen.

1913
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:45,760
So it was created by Konoe Itaka, who joined Namco in 1991.

1914
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,920
His first project was Tank Force, which was a sequel to Tank Battalion.

1915
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:54,320
He also worked on the original Point Blank and Time Crisis.

1916
01:40:54,320 --> 01:41:01,520
So when he noticed that the arcades had a lot of young couples playing, he wanted to

1917
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,200
make a machine that young couples could play.

1918
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:11,740
He also noticed that buddy cop movies in Japan were becoming more popular, like movies like

1919
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,240
Chips and Police Story.

1920
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:18,680
And so he made the game.

1921
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:24,360
I mean, the title in Japan is called Joe and Paunch, as it was inspired by chips.

1922
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:29,520
That always makes me think of Space Ghost Coast to Coast with Moltar.

1923
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,320
Cool chips.

1924
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,280
That was always funny.

1925
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:40,520
Anyway, he also got some ideas from Sega's Railchase, which was, you know, had the motion

1926
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:45,120
based seat that reacted to your actions in the game, like shaking over the rocky roads

1927
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,780
and stuff like that.

1928
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:52,020
And so Lucky and Wild originally had that kind of shape in there, but Namco really wanted

1929
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:57,200
to have the light guns with the single shot and the trigger and everything.

1930
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:04,780
So eventually there became like this big consensus reached in.

1931
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:06,460
This is what came out.

1932
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:14,340
It was released in Japan in April 1993 and in May in North America.

1933
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:24,140
So there it was it borrowed from other other things.

1934
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:29,980
So it had like the American Tuning Car Company brand was in the Ridge Racer games, although

1935
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:33,380
it belonged to the muscle cars.

1936
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:39,740
The Lucky and Wild protagonists appeared in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX with one person driving

1937
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,460
in the second being the gunner.

1938
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:42,460
Really?

1939
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,460
Yeah.

1940
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:44,580
Wow.

1941
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:45,580
I didn't know that.

1942
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,820
How did I miss that?

1943
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:53,660
And in the interactive video series Bear Stearns Bravo, the Bear Stearns CEO Jackie Dalton

1944
01:42:53,660 --> 01:43:00,860
refers to the regulators Franco and Henry by the name of Lucky and Wild.

1945
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:06,140
So Game Machine states that this was the third most popular arcade game in May of 1993 in

1946
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,420
Japan.

1947
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:12,540
Replay states that it was the fourth most popular deluxe arcade game at the time and

1948
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:17,420
Play Meter listed it as the twenty fifth most popular arcade game at the time.

1949
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:27,540
So it goes along from a different, you know, different places that they'll argue against

1950
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:28,540
it.

1951
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:33,540
But at any rate, Lucky and Wild, Lucky and Wild.

1952
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:34,540
That's it.

1953
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,540
That's the tweet.

1954
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:39,180
I just love that, like, especially as far as Namco is concerned, like there must have

1955
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:44,180
been some type of meeting where it's like, OK, do we make another racing game or do we

1956
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:46,860
make another time crisis shooting game?

1957
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:47,860
And it's all hell.

1958
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:51,100
We're going to make both.

1959
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,660
Why not both at the same time?

1960
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,580
And here we have Lucky and Wild.

1961
01:43:55,580 --> 01:44:07,500
I'm trying to actually think of how to say that in Japanese and let me see, but I still

1962
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,620
see these cabinets around today once in a while.

1963
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,680
It's a fun game.

1964
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,680
It's silly.

1965
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,680
In a good way.

1966
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,140
All right.

1967
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:25,040
So I would I think it's no real whole day when I oh, was that the translation for why

1968
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,040
not?

1969
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,040
Why not?

1970
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,040
Yeah.

1971
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,040
Yeah.

1972
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,040
Yeah.

1973
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,040
Perfect.

1974
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,040
All right.

1975
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,040
There it is.

1976
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,040
Your classic game of the week.

1977
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,040
Lucky and Wild for the record.

1978
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,480
Namco just did predate time crisis.

1979
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,440
Oh, oh, well, still.

1980
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,440
OK, fine.

1981
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,440
Then point blank.

1982
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,440
All right.

1983
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:48,120
Which actually might have predated that to know I have to double check time crisis now.

1984
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,120
Yeah.

1985
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,120
All right.

1986
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,120
Anyhow.

1987
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,360
Well, don't don't get too far into the double checking because we're going to move on.

1988
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,360
Yeah.

1989
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,360
Time crisis was nineteen ninety five.

1990
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,360
All right.

1991
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,360
My bad.

1992
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,360
My bad.

1993
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,360
But Namco had other shooters that existed prior to that.

1994
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,360
I know point blank for sure.

1995
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:04,960
But anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other stories going

1996
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,320
on in the industry.

1997
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,320
So I will start.

1998
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,720
I have a story about the Tokyo Olympics.

1999
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,360
And last week we were kind of talking about a lot of those video game songs that were

2000
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:14,900
used in the opening ceremony.

2001
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,760
And there was a lot of question about, well, what about Nintendo?

2002
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,800
Where was Nintendo?

2003
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:24,360
Because the warp pipe showed up in the handoff at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

2004
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:29,320
You know, where was the Nintendo presence at the Tokyo Olympics?

2005
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:33,040
And some folks were theorizing, you know, they probably pulled out because there's a

2006
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,720
lot of people in Japan that kind of think the Olympics is bullshit right now.

2007
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,720
Yeah.

2008
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,640
So they probably pulled out.

2009
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:44,440
And as it turns out, yeah, that's pretty much what happened.

2010
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,440
But this is as report.

2011
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,800
So, you know, we don't have it from Nintendo themselves.

2012
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,560
But this was reported by a Japanese publication, Bunshun.

2013
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:54,440
And I don't know, like, are we talking about a National Enquirer?

2014
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,440
I'm sorry, Bunshun.

2015
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,680
I don't know if we're talking about like a National Enquirer type of publication or we're

2016
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,080
talking about something a little more respectable.

2017
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,960
But there were they are reporting there were last minute changes.

2018
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,560
Apparently the event was going to have the Legend of Zelda theme, the Mario suite, Kirby

2019
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,560
Superstar Medley.

2020
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,280
Oh, sorry, Mike Deft.

2021
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,760
The Pokemon opening.

2022
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:17,120
And also, apparently, Lady Gaga was going to do a gag.

2023
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,120
Now, she wasn't going to be there.

2024
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:25,800
But Lady Gaga was going to like go down into a pipe, a warp pipe in like recorded footage.

2025
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:29,720
And Japanese comedian Naomi Wanton be was going to come out.

2026
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,760
Watanabe.

2027
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:35,840
Sorry, Watanabe was going to come out of the pipe as like probably like a Gaga impersonator

2028
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,600
or something like that.

2029
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:43,280
But sadly, the ideas were thrown away because of the controversial statements by the company.

2030
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,920
You know, they had all the questions, the issues with all those shitty things that were

2031
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,960
said beforehand.

2032
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,600
That's why Nintendo pulled out, basically.

2033
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,040
So I do have to explain a little bit of something about Shukan Bunshun.

2034
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,080
OK.

2035
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:07,520
Is that this magazine has been credited with bringing down a minister and a politician.

2036
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,960
And it nearly broke up one of Japan's biggest boy bands.

2037
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:19,800
So basically, the magazine does exposes and investigative reporting and typically has

2038
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,200
a lot of clashes with Japanese government.

2039
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,200
Interesting.

2040
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,200
OK.

2041
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:29,280
This isn't a tabloid.

2042
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,440
This is like an expose magazine.

2043
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,440
Interesting.

2044
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,440
OK.

2045
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,440
All right.

2046
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,440
Good to know.

2047
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,440
Yeah.

2048
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:40,800
So it's it's it's a little more Teen Vogue and a little less National Enquire basically

2049
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,800
or TMZ.

2050
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Perez.

2051
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,800
Yeah.

2052
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,800
Yeah.

2053
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,800
OK.

2054
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,800
All right.

2055
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,800
In other rap.

2056
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,800
Maybe a little more Al Jazeera.

2057
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,800
Fine.

2058
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,800
All right.

2059
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,480
Hey, there's a lot of great stuff that Teen Vogue's done in the past few years.

2060
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,480
All right.

2061
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:56,480
Oh no.

2062
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,480
Teen Vogue is amazing.

2063
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,760
Anyway, what else is amazing?

2064
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,440
The Simpsons arcade game is a great game from years ago.

2065
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,200
In fact, oh my God, is that it's 30 years old.

2066
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,020
It sure is as a 30 year old game.

2067
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,560
And we had all those rumors going into E3.

2068
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,560
In fact, they weren't just rumors.

2069
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:16,480
We had a fucking trailer that leaked and still yet no announcement at E3 about the Simpsons

2070
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,480
arcade one up machine.

2071
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,120
Well, guess what?

2072
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,200
We will never know what caused the delay.

2073
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,480
Nobody's saying anything.

2074
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:29,400
All we know is that arcade one up officially announced the Simpsons arcade retro cabinet

2075
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:33,620
and it's going to have authentic artwork and relatively easy assembly.

2076
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:37,000
You can start preordering the machine on August 16th.

2077
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,040
We don't know how much the machine is going to cost, but just so you know, Turtles in

2078
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:46,140
Time is six hundred and fifty dollars and that is a pretty similar sort of thing.

2079
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:49,540
And there's only going to be one game with this, with the Simpsons, because a lot of

2080
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:52,100
those cabinets have multiple games in them.

2081
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:53,100
Not this one.

2082
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:57,780
So, but I will say if there's any cabinet that people remember from their childhood

2083
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:00,340
that they might, it might be this one.

2084
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:04,980
Anyway, I am crossing my fingers and toes that this means that Tron cabinet isn't far

2085
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:05,980
behind.

2086
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:06,980
But you know what?

2087
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,380
I'm not going to hold my breath either.

2088
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:12,740
Oh, Orange Wright says, I heard this also has Simpsons bowling.

2089
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:14,380
It has a track ball.

2090
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,380
Interesting.

2091
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:18,260
But yeah, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what happened to the bowling game.

2092
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,940
I didn't see the trackball on the new picture.

2093
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:21,940
Hmm.

2094
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:26,060
I wonder if something is there about why it got delayed.

2095
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,060
I don't know.

2096
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,060
I don't know.

2097
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:29,060
Just maybe it's an add on you have to pay for.

2098
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:32,260
Well, but then you have to pay for that trackball too, which would be weird to install.

2099
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:33,260
That's what I'm talking about.

2100
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:36,260
You have to pay for like a trackball edition or something.

2101
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:37,260
Yeah.

2102
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:38,260
Yeah.

2103
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,720
So Bobby Blackwell is saying the rumor is the Simpsons bowling is the license that got

2104
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,900
revoked and that was an eleventh hour revoked.

2105
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:47,300
So that might, we might be starting to put together why did this suddenly not get announced

2106
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,300
at E3?

2107
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,300
Aha.

2108
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,300
But we don't have it.

2109
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,840
We don't have a definitive answer on that.

2110
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,300
We just, we just sort of are reading tea leaves there.

2111
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:58,540
Anyhow moving on Dark Sakura.

2112
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:01,220
So finally updates for Animal Crossing.

2113
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,860
So maybe I'll check on my village.

2114
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:08,420
The updates, well, it says the update is supposed to happen July 29th.

2115
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:10,700
So I missed that.

2116
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,540
And that there were going to be more updates later in 2021.

2117
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:15,300
So hopefully they'll be good.

2118
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,540
I mean, it's the fireworks and the seasonal items.

2119
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:22,500
So I don't know if it's going to be worth me playing again.

2120
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:30,540
And then Hot Wheels Unleashed is going to have some pop culture cars in it.

2121
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:37,500
So among those is going to be the Turtles party wagon from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2122
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:42,900
Apparently Snoopy, I guess on the, on the doghouse, you know, the Red Baron.

2123
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:43,900
Yeah.

2124
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:44,900
Yeah.

2125
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:45,900
Yeah.

2126
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:46,900
The Red Baron.

2127
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:47,900
Yeah.

2128
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:48,900
A kit from Knight Rider.

2129
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:49,900
The DeLorean from Back to the Future.

2130
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:50,900
The Batmobile.

2131
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:54,700
I don't know which Batmobile, but there is something in there that honestly is more exciting

2132
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,700
than all of that to me, Rob.

2133
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,700
Hmm.

2134
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:58,700
A Fiat 500.

2135
01:50:58,700 --> 01:50:59,700
Well, there you go.

2136
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,580
Cause I drive one.

2137
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:08,000
Every time I see a Hot Wheel Fiat, I buy it for myself the same way.

2138
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,100
Every time I see any kind of Mustang, I buy it for Danny.

2139
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,540
He's got so many Hot Wheel Mustangs.

2140
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,540
It's not even funny.

2141
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,540
Nice.

2142
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,540
Yeah.

2143
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:17,540
All right.

2144
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:21,580
Now, if we could only get like the Hot Wheels pinball would be set.

2145
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:24,980
Sia Tabiri bringing us what else is with that Animal Crossing update.

2146
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:30,140
You can now get Boba tea and cotton candy in the drawings during fireworks events in

2147
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:31,700
Animal Crossing New Horizons.

2148
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,700
Well, that's cute.

2149
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,700
Well, crap.

2150
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,700
I better play.

2151
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,700
All right.

2152
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:40,700
Hey, there's, there's something to do instead of Fantation one night or whatever you were

2153
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,700
thinking.

2154
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,700
Animal Crossing journey.

2155
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:43,700
All right.

2156
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,700
Hmm.

2157
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:45,700
Anyway.

2158
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,700
That one's even harder to get my stuff set up for.

2159
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,700
All right.

2160
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:48,700
All right.

2161
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,380
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming

2162
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:53,100
out soon near you.

2163
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:55,140
Um, I, uh, Loki's not here tonight.

2164
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:57,680
I will try to do the U S dates here.

2165
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,960
So I'm on August 2nd age of empires three definitive edition is coming out for windows.

2166
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,260
I kind of think that's probably the temple release this week because I don't see a lot

2167
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:10,940
of big, big stuff this week, although for windows and stadia, we do have grime is coming

2168
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:11,940
out on the second.

2169
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:17,360
Uh, we also have in sound mind coming out for windows, switch, PS five, Xbox series

2170
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,360
X.

2171
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,560
That is a horror game, uh, from, we create stuff.

2172
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:25,280
Uh, and then we have the falconeer warrior edition on switch PlayStation four and PlayStation

2173
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,280
five.

2174
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,500
That is a, um, air combat type of game.

2175
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:32,000
So, uh, that, that's it for releases in the U S this week.

2176
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,240
Um, let me, let me get in my plane and fly over to Japan real quick and get some of the

2177
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:37,520
releases over there.

2178
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,640
Um, on August 5th on the Nintendo switch, we have the legend of heroes trails of cold

2179
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,020
steel too.

2180
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:46,080
We also have that falconeer game is out on the switch this week.

2181
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,280
Um, and that's it on the switch.

2182
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,940
Let me check the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five PlayStation five is getting

2183
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,960
the falconeer as well.

2184
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:55,960
So that is out.

2185
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:58,540
There's also a special guilty gears.

2186
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:02,060
There's not a guilty your game, but like a fighting stick coming out if peripherals are

2187
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,060
of interest to you.

2188
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:06,780
Uh, and then the falconeer, that appears to be the big release in Japan because that is

2189
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,660
also on the PlayStation four this week.

2190
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:13,300
But you can also get dirt five, uh, in Japan getting its release, uh, for Japanese audiences

2191
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,260
on the PlayStation four this week.

2192
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,480
How about the UK dark Sakura?

2193
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:22,300
Just a handful on, um, uh, third August we have spirit fair.

2194
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:27,740
On the sixth that we have blue fire and Zenjin, I reckon that's how it's said.

2195
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:30,260
And on the seventh we have seven days to die.

2196
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,260
How appropriate.

2197
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,260
All right.

2198
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:33,260
That's it.

2199
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,260
All right.

2200
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:37,180
Kind of a slower week, but understandable.

2201
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:40,000
We'll probably get a little more as we get into labor day and all that.

2202
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,520
So let's get back into just a few stories here, uh, and then we'll get to a listener

2203
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,520
round table.

2204
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,740
I know I saw at least one email before the show tonight and then, um, we'll see, we'll

2205
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,740
see if there's any calls.

2206
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,740
Why not?

2207
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:53,660
Um, or any questions you guys might have in chat.

2208
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,240
And then of course, uh, I might pull a few stories from our discord, although I kind

2209
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:00,240
of pulled some to fill out tonight's show role, but, uh, I do encourage you guys to

2210
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,080
join our discord and, uh, continue the conversation throughout the week, especially now that they

2211
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,640
have threads.

2212
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:09,000
Like w you know, what's funny is that when we first made the switch to discord, I kind

2213
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
of joked with Bobby.

2214
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,840
I said, discord kind of replaced our forums on VOG network.

2215
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,120
Cause you know, that got overrun with spammers.

2216
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:17,840
We haven't used those forums in a long time.

2217
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:22,540
They, they honestly just shouldn't even really be there except for the fact that, um, we

2218
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:25,280
dark, we post our story stuff.

2219
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,280
That's it.

2220
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,280
OLR has a secret forum.

2221
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,280
We're still using it.

2222
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:32,620
Um, but yeah, and I think some of that actually powers, I just email you.

2223
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:33,620
I know.

2224
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,620
I know.

2225
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:35,620
Um, yeah.

2226
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:36,620
Yeah.

2227
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:37,620
Yeah.

2228
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:38,620
Yeah.

2229
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,160
Although it probably would be better if you could get back on the forums.

2230
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:42,020
It's all in one place, but it's all right.

2231
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:45,420
Honestly, we should just kind of all move it, but we can talk about that later.

2232
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:48,380
Cause I kind of think we should just have a special discord channel.

2233
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:49,940
Let's move to slack.

2234
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:51,380
Well, why not discord?

2235
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,420
We already have one set up.

2236
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:53,420
It's the same thing.

2237
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,420
I guess.

2238
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,420
All right.

2239
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:58,460
Um, any Hey, uh, DJ Rama S says one note.

2240
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,860
It's what we have at anime jam session.

2241
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:00,860
Actually.

2242
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,860
I love one note at work.

2243
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,860
I never thought about using it for my personal stuff, but I use it at work all the time.

2244
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,860
I'm on a Mac.

2245
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:07,860
Mac has Microsoft stuff.

2246
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:08,860
Yeah.

2247
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:11,020
I don't want to have to pay for one note.

2248
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:12,020
All right.

2249
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:13,660
If it, if it's going to make me pay for it.

2250
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,660
All right.

2251
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:21,020
Uh, let's talk about, uh, this story and, uh, it is, this was getting a lot of traction

2252
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:27,500
on social media this week and it has to do with, uh, a new series reported for Netflix,

2253
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:32,340
a live action Pokemon series for Netflix.

2254
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:37,440
This is not necessarily from the minds behind detective Pikachu, cause that's where a lot

2255
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,220
of people's heads win at first, which I thought detective Pikachu was cute.

2256
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:45,180
Like, and I was like, if there's a live action thing behind that, I kind of would be into

2257
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:46,180
it.

2258
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:47,180
I think.

2259
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:48,500
However, this is coming from Lucifer's.

2260
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:52,700
So the people behind Lucifer, Joe Henderson, we don't know a lot else.

2261
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:55,260
Uh, this is a report that came from variety.

2262
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:59,780
Variety is a, I guess the expose, but of Hollywood.

2263
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:04,060
So they run a lot like variety and deadline are kind of the big names in Hollywood, uh,

2264
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:06,340
that talk about what's going on in the industry.

2265
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:10,760
There variety is reporting that the live action Pokemon series is in the works at Netflix

2266
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,400
with Joe Henderson from Lucifer on deck as writer and executive producer.

2267
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,400
That's it.

2268
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,400
It's in its early days.

2269
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,820
We don't know the plot.

2270
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:21,040
Is it the, is it detective Pikachu?

2271
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,680
Is it the anime series?

2272
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,920
Is it a new story?

2273
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:24,920
I don't know.

2274
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,040
It's in its early stages.

2275
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,040
Nobody knows.

2276
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:30,720
A lot of people are jumping to conclusions, but we don't know.

2277
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:37,720
Um, however, variety is saying that the Netflix show, according to sources, would be a live

2278
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:43,800
action series akin to the detective Pikachu film with Ryan Reynolds and justice Smith.

2279
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,560
But I don't see when I hear that, I don't hear it's in the same universe or it's the

2280
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,560
same thing.

2281
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,820
I hear this is not an anime.

2282
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:56,120
This is not a cartoon because Netflix has been doing a lot of animes and cartoons.

2283
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:59,980
So I think some people could have inferred that, Oh, they're just, you know, gonna make

2284
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:02,620
their own movie or their own series or whatever.

2285
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:04,680
And that's not actually what's happening here.

2286
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,640
So all right.

2287
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:14,100
Um, anyhow, um, we don't know a lot else, so we have not heard a single person cast.

2288
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,160
We haven't seen a single frame of footage.

2289
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:20,560
I kind of think I'm, you know what, why not?

2290
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,680
Like how bad could it be?

2291
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,800
Famous last words.

2292
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,320
I'm willing to give it a try.

2293
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,640
At least let's see a trailer.

2294
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,560
I again, I liked detective Pikachu.

2295
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:33,840
I think a lot of that rest on Ryan and Ryan Ryan Reynolds, but I like, I haven't seen

2296
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,680
it and I want to, you should, I liked the way conceptually they put Pokemon in the real

2297
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,940
world as if it was just a thing that was always around.

2298
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,600
I thought it was really cute.

2299
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,600
So we'll see.

2300
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:50,320
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says the live action Pokemon series is a gateway to the smash brothers

2301
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,320
movie universe.

2302
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,160
Hey, Hey, I'll take it.

2303
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,120
Um, SSJ 100.

2304
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:00,520
Matt says with the success of detective Pikachu, I'm sure they fast tracked anything Pokemon

2305
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,520
related.

2306
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:02,520
Well, sure.

2307
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:05,720
Things like Pokemon go, which I didn't get into that at the top of the show.

2308
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:08,400
We're going to need some extra cause we need some extra stories.

2309
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,440
We're going to have some extra stories in a little bit.

2310
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:15,440
Um, we did have a hint of it and then a fifth dream in chat says it's a whole show with

2311
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,440
only Bidoof.

2312
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,440
Oh, my dream.

2313
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,440
My dream.

2314
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,440
The Bidoof show.

2315
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,440
I will.

2316
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:24,760
It's a, it's actually just a chat talk show with Bidoof, but, but, but, but you also need

2317
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:31,240
like the, uh, like, you know how like at the end of He-Man they would have like the lesson.

2318
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:33,280
You need that presented by a medkip.

2319
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,280
I love it.

2320
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,280
All right.

2321
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:40,320
Uh, so anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hear more about that probably in a year.

2322
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:43,920
If that, when somebody gets cast for this, I think once you start to hear what the cast

2323
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,480
is, then you might know like what the story is.

2324
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,200
So like if they cast an Ash Ketchum, then we know they're probably going around the

2325
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,560
anime, but if they don't, then they're probably doing their own thing.

2326
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,100
So we'll see.

2327
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:02,220
If they do a Satoshi, then they're saying, we're going to do this the right way there,

2328
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:08,680
but I have the, I have a feeling this is going to be very, uh, North America based, but maybe

2329
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:09,680
I'm wrong.

2330
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:10,680
Maybe I'm wrong.

2331
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:11,980
That could be interesting too.

2332
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,240
We'll see.

2333
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,240
We don't know.

2334
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:15,240
All right.

2335
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,580
Um, how about, how about we do our extra stories now we're going to, we're going to break the

2336
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:23,040
rules a little bit and insert two stories that are not in the sidebar.

2337
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,740
So Dark Soccer, you just texted me something you wanted to talk about.

2338
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,740
So why don't you go for it?

2339
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,940
Cause I think it's funny.

2340
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:28,940
I did.

2341
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:33,260
I was poking at my Twitter for just a second and I saw that Ariana Grande was trending

2342
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:36,300
and I'm like, what the hell is she done now?

2343
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:45,620
Um, and it looks like that she is partnered with a Fortnite for a rift tour concert series.

2344
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:51,980
Um, the series is scheduled for August six through eight with five show times over three

2345
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:53,180
days.

2346
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:58,820
So it's a musical experience they say with a special playlist and a playable character

2347
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,060
that was inspired by Ariana.

2348
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:05,500
Um, the character actually looks really cute and you're like wearing like this sort of

2349
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:09,260
sparkly metallic holographic ish kind of thing.

2350
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:13,340
And of course with her signature, like purple topknot, it is very purple.

2351
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:20,660
Um, I'll just go ahead and read what exactly, um, this says, uh, Fortnite user, uh, apparently

2352
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:25,620
they can schedule their showtime in Fortnite and then coordinate with their friends.

2353
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:33,020
You go to rift tour.com for it and then, uh, she will be added to the games icon series

2354
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:37,900
and then you get the items, uh, that are available from the item shop from her, including the

2355
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:44,300
outfit and this like yellow piggy backpack called piggy smalls back bling and it's inspired

2356
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:48,620
by her, her real life piglet pet for the record.

2357
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:51,780
Don't forget a piglet as a pet, they will get big.

2358
02:00:51,780 --> 02:01:03,140
Um, and so, uh, this is a supposed to blow away Travis Scott's, uh, thing where they,

2359
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:08,380
uh, basically broke the record for biggest live audience in Fortnite.

2360
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:14,500
Um, so I don't know, it looks interesting that the trailer looks interesting.

2361
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:19,780
Um, it's not enough to ever make me desire to want to play Fortnite, like in the least.

2362
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:23,220
Not my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.

2363
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:25,820
I said my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.

2364
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:33,940
All right, well you do you, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing, but I'll be there.

2365
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:35,940
Nothing but the best for our queen.

2366
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:38,140
All right.

2367
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,940
You know, she has one song that I like only because it kind of grew on me because they'd

2368
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,700
play it at Badlands every fucking time I was there.

2369
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:50,760
I like, okay, Into You is like a quintessential like gay song.

2370
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,760
That's a gay anthem.

2371
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,880
I love that song.

2372
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,500
It was, uh, um, No Tears Left to Cry, but I also really liked the video for it.

2373
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,420
I liked the cinematography in the video.

2374
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,420
Yes, that was good too.

2375
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:05,220
I really liked Thank U, Next that spoofed all the nineties films.

2376
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:06,900
I thought it was so cute.

2377
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,740
The video for that was great and I actually liked the message of the song, but I don't

2378
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:11,740
like the song.

2379
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,740
Fair.

2380
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:16,620
And then there was a song in DDR that just recently got pulled because the license expired.

2381
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:20,420
It was, um, it wasn't Into You, but it was something else from that album.

2382
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:21,420
Help Me, Bamani fans.

2383
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,540
What was the song of hers?

2384
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:25,900
It was the sci-fi video where she was shooting the aliens and stuff.

2385
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:30,820
I can't remember the name of the song, her brother's in it too, but, but, uh, I can't

2386
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,540
remember the name of the song.

2387
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,540
Bad Gay.

2388
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,540
Help.

2389
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,540
That's okay.

2390
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:37,820
I don't know what song is at all.

2391
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:44,140
Are there, are there any, see it to be somebody in chat who knows their music help.

2392
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,140
They break free.

2393
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:46,140
That's it.

2394
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:47,140
That's it.

2395
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,140
How can I forget that song?

2396
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:49,140
It's such a good song too.

2397
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:52,140
This is the part where I break free.

2398
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:53,140
All right.

2399
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,500
Anyway, that's, that's, that's it.

2400
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,500
I'm never doing that again.

2401
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:00,940
If you could see, if you see me looking at my, my cam right now, I'm looking at you,

2402
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:01,940
Rob.

2403
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:04,260
I see you through the internet and I'm judging you.

2404
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:05,260
Stop it.

2405
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,260
All right.

2406
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,260
I feel awkward.

2407
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:09,660
All right.

2408
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:10,940
Now my story.

2409
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,620
So let's talk about this.

2410
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:17,720
So a lot of people dunking on Niantic today on Twitter, uh, because of Pokemon Go, which

2411
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,720
is still going.

2412
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:24,420
But as it is August 1st, you may or may not recall Niantic said they were going to be

2413
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:29,240
reverting some changes that they had made due to COVID and all this, they were going

2414
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:32,100
to be reverting some of that on August 1st.

2415
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:36,060
And a lot of people are pissed off that they made good on that promise today.

2416
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:42,300
And the big one is you can no longer spin pokey stops or gyms that are 80 meters away.

2417
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:48,060
The radius is back down to what it used to be 40, which is very similar to what, um,

2418
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:51,900
uh, the, the, uh, range is always been an ingress.

2419
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,900
Sure.

2420
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:56,940
Lower it when we have new variants, you know, out and people are stupid.

2421
02:03:56,940 --> 02:03:57,940
Exactly.

2422
02:03:57,940 --> 02:03:59,500
You saw the Lollapalooza thing, right?

2423
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,500
Exactly.

2424
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,500
Well, I'm sorry.

2425
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,500
Massive spreader event.

2426
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:06,140
Vaccinations were required to get into Lollapalooza too, though.

2427
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:11,540
Um, people, but anyway, um, the, uh, Oh, what was I gonna say with all that?

2428
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:15,740
The, um, interface game?

2429
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:16,740
Yes.

2430
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,740
Radius?

2431
02:04:17,740 --> 02:04:18,740
Yes.

2432
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:19,740
The, the, Oh yeah.

2433
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:23,620
So, um, a lot of that was in response to COVID and all that.

2434
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,620
Um, but I, here's the problem.

2435
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,820
Here's the problem.

2436
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:31,020
I think that change was never really about COVID.

2437
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:32,420
It really wasn't.

2438
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:37,740
Um, I think they made certain concessions so that people would keep playing the game

2439
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:41,860
and so that they wouldn't complete, like obviously the remote rating was put in and all of that

2440
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:42,860
stuff.

2441
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:47,980
But, um, 40 meters is still a pretty, I just, I'm going to preface this, I'm not defending

2442
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:55,380
what Niantic did, but I think the error is not, it's, it's, it's how they did it.

2443
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:56,720
So they doubled the distance.

2444
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:58,540
They said, because of COVID we're doing this.

2445
02:04:58,540 --> 02:05:03,160
And then they said, this is a change that's probably, that's going to be permanent, basically.

2446
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,480
They went back on that.

2447
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:07,140
That's the first mistake they made.

2448
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:12,620
The second mistake they made was when they went back on it, they put, they, they used

2449
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:15,420
COVID as an excuse.

2450
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:18,780
That I think is the biggest problem they made.

2451
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:23,700
They're they didn't, they never scaled it up, in my opinion, due to COVID to begin with.

2452
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:29,380
And for them to now say, well, because COVID is, you know, uh, you know, we, we, we have

2453
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:35,280
a different standards now, rules now, whatever, uh, we're going to take this part away.

2454
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:41,040
And I think they're using COVID as a crutch and an excuse for something that was generating

2455
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,040
revenue.

2456
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,620
And that was people buying Pokeballs and things like that.

2457
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:50,620
So, uh, that's the tacky part to me is that they never should have scapegoated it as a

2458
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,260
COVID thing to begin with.

2459
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:55,300
And they certainly shouldn't be doing that now.

2460
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:57,660
And it's pissing off a lot of fans.

2461
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:58,660
It's just rude.

2462
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:01,380
I just don't, I don't think fans are going to stop playing the game.

2463
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:02,540
I really don't.

2464
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:07,540
Um, I even saw the guy from Serebii and I'm not, you know, I'm just saying big names in

2465
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:14,180
the Pokemon industry are, you know, in fandom are going out and saying this is fucked up.

2466
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:18,180
So hopefully Niantic, it kind of pressures them into changing it back or what have you.

2467
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,540
But it's only gonna happen if people stop spending money.

2468
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,540
That's the only way.

2469
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:29,820
I was considering playing it again and now I'm absolutely not going to.

2470
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:34,260
So we'll, I mean, it's Sunday, so we'll see what happens come tomorrow after all this

2471
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,980
negative press today.

2472
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:40,520
But I also wrote a tweet that I'm surprised more people didn't see because I want to point

2473
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,900
out something else.

2474
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:54,060
I got an email today at 1 30 in the afternoon from Ingress, one of Niantic's other games.

2475
02:06:54,060 --> 02:07:00,660
And it says, August virtual first Saturday, August first Saturday at home, Saturday, August

2476
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:05,700
7th, 2021 join our first Saturday, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2477
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:09,820
Isn't that interesting that another Niantic game completely recognizes that things are

2478
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:15,820
still virtual and things are still done this, you know, in a different way because COVID

2479
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:17,820
is not a hundred percent gone.

2480
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:18,820
Hmm.

2481
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:22,860
Yeah, it's not going to be gone at all.

2482
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:28,640
Yet Pokemon Go goes and says, oh, we're going to scale these things back or whatever.

2483
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:30,420
You know that that's the problem.

2484
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:36,620
Pokemon Go using COVID as a scapegoat to do this now is incorrect.

2485
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:41,460
Mike Deft in chat says, pissing off is pretty tame.

2486
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:44,280
Mike Deft says the whole player base is all sorts of mad.

2487
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:47,260
Even influencers who work with Niantic are getting ignored.

2488
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,260
Hmm.

2489
02:07:48,260 --> 02:07:52,620
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, there is apparently something that data miners found saying there

2490
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:57,220
will be a way to power up Pokestops, which people are theorizing that means when you

2491
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:00,620
power up a stop, you get more items and wider range.

2492
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:01,620
Wow.

2493
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,380
Sounds like a moneymaker to me.

2494
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:07,340
Sounds like when they increased this range and said, it'll be permanent.

2495
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:11,360
Somebody said, why didn't we charge for that?

2496
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:20,140
It just comes off as really tacky on the heels of that report from days ago that talked about

2497
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:25,140
how Niantic made a ton of money off Pokemon Go Fest.

2498
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:26,140
Yike.

2499
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:27,140
Hmm.

2500
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:32,400
DJ Rama S says, maybe Pokemon Go is on a different team from Ingress and both teams aren't talking

2501
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:34,360
to each other about COVID issues and support.

2502
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:36,920
Oh, probably, but it's still not a good look.

2503
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:38,320
Remember, remember we got one of those.

2504
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,600
I need a card for this too.

2505
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:43,860
Remember, it's not about the news.

2506
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,320
It's not about the truth behind.

2507
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:50,360
It's about what is perceived by the folks.

2508
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:55,600
Or to quote Eddie Izzard, it's like 75% of it is how you sound.

2509
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:00,760
10% of it is what you say and 5% is what you mean, I think.

2510
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,760
Yes.

2511
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:03,120
Exactly.

2512
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:06,760
All right, let's move on back to the stories.

2513
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:10,480
We had show rolled, but I both those things were big things we needed to get out.

2514
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,200
I think they're even bigger in the last minute stories.

2515
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:13,200
So.

2516
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,200
All right.

2517
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,200
I have no tears left to cry.

2518
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:16,200
Thank you.

2519
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,200
Why don't we break?

2520
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,200
We vibing.

2521
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:21,760
Let's break free from this segment and go to our next story.

2522
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:31,920
So there is now I'm going into some kind of like obscure kind of local news for where

2523
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,000
is this Wilmington?

2524
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,080
I don't know what Wilmington it is, but it's a Wilmington.

2525
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:41,240
But I wanted to bring it up because I think it's a really cool thing and I think we need

2526
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,160
more of this happening.

2527
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:48,720
So there is a video game lounge in Wilmington called Retroscape.

2528
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:52,480
I'll have to look up more about that.

2529
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:58,560
But basically what they are doing is that they have a video game summer day camp for

2530
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,160
kids throughout all of July.

2531
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:08,840
And their goal is to get these kids acquainted with the classics.

2532
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:11,880
So sort of like video game history lab.

2533
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:20,520
So they go in and they give them a presentation about the decade, you know, of gaming.

2534
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:25,680
And so they did the 70s, 80s, 90s, and then they did the aughts and then go over the console

2535
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:30,960
wars and then what was popular and then they do trivia and then they have the kids play

2536
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,320
those games.

2537
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:35,720
So it's pretty cool.

2538
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:42,480
It's a way of bringing the younger generation in touch with the origins of what they enjoy

2539
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,160
today.

2540
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:48,240
Yeah.

2541
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:52,920
And I still don't know what Wilmington this is.

2542
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,400
Delaware?

2543
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:58,320
Uh, uh, North Carolina.

2544
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,880
Oh, okay.

2545
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,880
Okay.

2546
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:01,880
Yeah.

2547
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,440
So there you go.

2548
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,440
That's pretty cool.

2549
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:06,440
Yeah.

2550
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:09,440
I think more people would have been excited to go to summer camp if video games were involved.

2551
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,440
Same.

2552
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:13,320
I only had Bible camp.

2553
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,320
Yeah.

2554
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,320
Me too.

2555
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:16,320
When I was younger.

2556
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:17,320
Yeah.

2557
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:18,320
Yeah.

2558
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,320
Not quite the same.

2559
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,640
Well, they would do, I think I want to say maybe we did play video games when they would

2560
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,760
do like their lock-in stuff or whatever.

2561
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:25,120
I want to say, because not us.

2562
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,120
Yeah.

2563
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,120
Which is interesting.

2564
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,400
It was singing Jesus songs.

2565
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:33,400
I want to say Atari 2600 games then were not very controversial.

2566
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,680
All that stuff didn't come up till years later.

2567
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,680
This was Alabama though.

2568
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,040
We didn't have any of that.

2569
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,040
They wouldn't pay for it.

2570
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:45,680
They thought it was all the devil and we would make dioramas out of toilet paper rolls and

2571
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:50,200
boxes and cotton, um, cotton balls.

2572
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:51,200
Yay for cotton.

2573
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,200
Jesus.

2574
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:56,400
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says it's Wilmington, North Carolina and actually links to retro

2575
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,400
Wilmington.com.

2576
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:58,400
Cool.

2577
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,660
But DJ Rama S brings up, I had computer camp.

2578
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:03,360
It was kind of a, I do remember computer camp being a thing.

2579
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:04,880
When I was younger.

2580
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:05,880
We didn't have that either.

2581
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:09,600
Yeah, I wasn't, I never really, maybe I did go, I did like a summer school thing that

2582
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,600
involved computer.

2583
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:13,880
That was probably the closest I got to it, but all right.

2584
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:14,880
Anyway.

2585
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,880
All right.

2586
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,880
One more story before the round table.

2587
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,360
And it is about, uh, I was a kid.

2588
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:24,840
We had to go into the swamp and catch some mud, mud bugs and wrestle a gator.

2589
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,280
We liked it.

2590
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:29,000
This last story is about Dr. Mario.

2591
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,400
Also a classic from the NES days.

2592
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:36,200
And maybe you were playing the, uh, more modern Dr. Mario world game.

2593
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:38,200
Uh, I played it for a hot minute.

2594
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:39,200
Yeah.

2595
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,200
Well guess what?

2596
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:41,200
You're not gonna be playing it anymore.

2597
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:46,920
Uh, at least as of October 31st, because Dr. Mario world's game servers will be going down.

2598
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:48,720
Womp, womp.

2599
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:54,480
Oh, so that is a, it, uh, apparently they're going to keep parts of the game on a site

2600
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,000
called Dr. Mario world memories.

2601
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,120
What the fuck consolation is that?

2602
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,440
I just want Dr. Mario.

2603
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,760
I mean, screw all that.

2604
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:09,080
Uh, anyway, uh, it just goes to show a lot of Nintendo's mobile stuff has not been doing

2605
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:12,280
as well as they thought because that game was only two years old.

2606
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:15,280
Um, so it isn't exactly an old game at this point.

2607
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,640
So, uh, Oh wow.

2608
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:19,160
Did your own mess as I play it for 10 minutes a day, give or take.

2609
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,480
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

2610
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,200
I'm sure there's clones of plenty out there though.

2611
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:28,840
So I guess you'll have to find a decent one of those or something or, uh, have the switch

2612
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:29,840
version.

2613
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:30,840
I don't know.

2614
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:31,840
All right.

2615
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,360
Anyway, let's get into the listener round table.

2616
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:40,800
We're going to get your chats, your comments in chat, uh, and, uh, the mailbag at participate

2617
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,520
at orange launch radio.com.

2618
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:45,720
If you want to call into the show, we can probably take one or two of those as well.

2619
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:50,480
Just head over to our green room in discord, vog network.com slash discord.

2620
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:55,880
Um, excuse me, but for now, let's go to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com

2621
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:57,400
dark soccer.

2622
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:02,900
We have one and it's long, but it's um, Hey, Hey, OLR right around the last team sale.

2623
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:05,940
My husband decided to buy an Oculus quest too.

2624
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:09,860
When I heard that he got it, I immediately went on steam and bought Moss beat saber, super

2625
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:14,600
hot VR and Skyrim VR of those beat saber is the only one I'm interested in.

2626
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:17,080
I love watching people play beat saber.

2627
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,820
Now let me first give you some background.

2628
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:19,820
Like Bobby black Wolf.

2629
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:21,200
I have a lazy eye.

2630
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:25,880
I had surgery to correct it when I was very young, so you don't see my left eye go out.

2631
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:30,040
However, the surgery caused me to slightly see double for most of my life.

2632
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:33,400
My glasses actually have prisons in there to help correct my vision growing up.

2633
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:38,320
I never had any issues with seeing 3d or so I thought it wasn't until about four years

2634
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:43,000
ago after I did vision therapy, I found out that I was missing a huge part of what 3d

2635
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
is.

2636
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,040
Before the therapy, I always thought that 3d was just things coming at you.

2637
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:52,320
I never knew you could also see objects going in like a hallway or a room.

2638
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,760
So this therapy opened up a whole new world for me.

2639
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:01,440
Anyway, I played VR games at magfest, but those games weren't that visually intensive.

2640
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:04,640
There is something about the Ikyulys quest two that makes it feel different.

2641
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:08,480
Maybe it's the no wires thing, the better resolution, or maybe I wasn't playing the

2642
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,800
right game when I was at magfest.

2643
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,080
I was so intimidated when I first put on the quest two headset.

2644
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:19,800
I mean, before you even get into a game, you're on this white room that seems to go on forever.

2645
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:24,120
After having the vision therapy, seeing something like this is very intense for me.

2646
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:28,880
It still is for me at times, I have to take a deep breath to calm down and that is when

2647
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:31,160
I'm not even in a game yet.

2648
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:33,920
So getting to the games, I have only played a couple so far.

2649
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,860
Moss is so fascinating to me, especially when I can see down the hallways and objects moving

2650
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:39,420
in the background.

2651
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:43,260
When the mouse quill looks up at you, it's just the cutest thing.

2652
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:47,600
Before I even start a page, I find myself just looking around for a couple of minutes

2653
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:49,280
just to take all of it in.

2654
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,000
I cannot wait for the sequel.

2655
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,120
I also have been playing a lot of Beat Saber.

2656
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:57,160
I love how I can be very active and have a lot of fun at the same time.

2657
02:15:57,160 --> 02:16:01,340
I really haven't gotten into superhot VR or Skyrim VR yet.

2658
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:04,240
You're probably thinking I probably should have emailed this to Bobby since he covers

2659
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:06,080
a lot of VR stuff.

2660
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:11,720
Let me get to one of the reasons why I decided to email this to OLR.

2661
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:16,600
Just the other day, my husband just bought a game called Synth Riders on the iCula store.

2662
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:19,840
This is a rhythm game very similar to Beat Saber.

2663
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:23,160
If you've never heard of this game, I really think all of you would love it.

2664
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:27,340
So slashing with sabers, you punch these colored spheres.

2665
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:33,060
There are also these holds that are very similar to the hold lines in DDR.

2666
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:38,580
When you hold down with one foot while you use your other foot to hit the arrows.

2667
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:41,720
In Synth Riders, you hold your arm.

2668
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:42,720
I lost my place.

2669
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:46,260
You hold up your arm and follow this curvy line with one hand and you use your other

2670
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:49,600
hand to follow another line or hit the spheres.

2671
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:54,520
You do this while you are listening to a mostly 80s-style synthwave music in a Tron-looking

2672
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:55,520
world.

2673
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:59,800
At one point, I thought I was in a slow-space mountain ride.

2674
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,620
This game is wild.

2675
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:03,680
You thought that Beat Saber was a workout.

2676
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:06,080
Synth Riders is on a whole other level.

2677
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:07,740
My body hurts after I am done.

2678
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:11,480
The music is so good that it makes me literally dance.

2679
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:15,300
The best part of this game is that custom songs are standard.

2680
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:16,840
You don't have to mod the game at all.

2681
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:20,760
You just drop in some files in your headset and the song appears in the song list.

2682
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:25,660
I highly recommend this game if you love rhythm games and want to become more physically active.

2683
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:30,420
Synth Riders is also available on Steam and is coming to PSVR August 10th.

2684
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:33,680
Since you have had less emails lately, I am hoping to write it more.

2685
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:39,600
I am planning on my next email to be about an old PC game that was based on a popular

2686
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:40,800
candy.

2687
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:43,920
I don't believe this game was ever talked about on OLR.

2688
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:44,920
Please look forward to it.

2689
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:45,760
Thanks, Ziba.

2690
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:48,600
I love it.

2691
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:49,600
Thanks for the email, Ziba.

2692
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,720
And thanks for the game recommendation.

2693
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:54,860
I thought I might have played this game once, but no, I'm confusing it with something else.

2694
02:17:54,860 --> 02:17:56,360
So I'm going to have to look into this.

2695
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:59,460
I'm not going to do VR, so have fun.

2696
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:02,680
I haven't played VR in a while.

2697
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:04,680
The bummer is I don't have PC VR.

2698
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:05,680
I have PlayStation.

2699
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:11,220
So if it's not on PlayStation, I probably won't get around to it unless I do get to

2700
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:15,140
spend a day with Bobby Black Wolf outside of Dragon Con when I go on my trip.

2701
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:19,580
So maybe he'll fire up the PC at Black Wolf Manor and I can check this game out.

2702
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:22,580
So I'll have to file that away in my brain to do that.

2703
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:23,580
Check that out.

2704
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:26,900
So because, you know, I'm going to want to play that Mandalorian pinball table, but I

2705
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:30,440
could come over to Jamie's house and play it there, get it out of my system.

2706
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:34,500
So we'll play it, play over here and then play Bobby's because we have two different

2707
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:35,500
versions.

2708
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:36,500
Ooh.

2709
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:37,500
And that would be fun to say I've played both.

2710
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:43,960
Well, I mean, I played multiple of I mean, well, and I think next year they're going

2711
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:46,760
to go back to doing Golden State pinball expo.

2712
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:47,760
Oh, uh huh.

2713
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,760
I hope so.

2714
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,760
But yeah, you're welcome to come over.

2715
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:54,080
We need to we need to hang.

2716
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,080
Yeah, it'll be fun.

2717
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,080
It'll be good.

2718
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,080
All right.

2719
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:58,080
Thank you for the email, Ziba.

2720
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,080
Appreciate it.

2721
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:03,620
I was glad to hear about the experience, too, as even though you kind of joke that maybe

2722
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:06,920
you should have sent it to Bobby because your experience was similar to him.

2723
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:08,740
We welcome those emails as well, of course.

2724
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:13,580
And yeah, I was definitely I'm always interested to hear.

2725
02:19:13,580 --> 02:19:16,900
These gaming stories from other people's perspectives, because it's like the trypophobia

2726
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:17,940
stuff we talked about this week.

2727
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:21,740
I would have never known, you know, unless something kind of came up about it and somebody

2728
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:22,740
brought it to my attention.

2729
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,740
You know what I mean?

2730
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:25,180
So I think it's neat.

2731
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:26,180
All right.

2732
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:27,820
We're going to take a call.

2733
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:30,900
And so I have to do a little magic behind the scenes to make this work.

2734
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:34,540
And let's go to our green room and we're going to bring in the caller.

2735
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:36,420
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2736
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:37,420
Who's this?

2737
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:40,020
Oh, it's the one and only DJ Ron mess.

2738
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:41,020
How is everybody doing?

2739
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:44,460
It is so good to actually see you, Rama.

2740
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:46,460
How are you doing, Rama?

2741
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,460
I'm great.

2742
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:50,620
I can tell that y'all got your gifts finally.

2743
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:51,620
Yes.

2744
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:54,540
I just saw Jamie held held hers up.

2745
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,540
And I sent you a picture of Mr. Smoosh with the patch.

2746
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:57,940
I don't have it here next to me.

2747
02:19:57,940 --> 02:19:58,940
But yeah.

2748
02:19:58,940 --> 02:19:59,940
Right.

2749
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:00,940
And I have mine right here.

2750
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:03,540
So not as Oh, you got more than one.

2751
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:07,460
They sent me an extra one purely by accident.

2752
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:11,140
When you pay for it, you're allowed to keep the extras, I think.

2753
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,140
So it's awesome.

2754
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:13,140
I love it.

2755
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:14,140
Right.

2756
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:17,340
Well, it's like I said, it's glow in the dark.

2757
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:19,660
I got to try that part out, actually, to us.

2758
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:22,020
So to what do we owe this fabulous phone call tonight?

2759
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:27,580
Well, I want to talk about something real quick from last week's show up and something

2760
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:33,340
that had mentioned and I agree with what she said, but at the same time, I'm kind of hesitant

2761
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:34,340
about it.

2762
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:36,820
It's about unionizing the whole gaming industry.

2763
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:38,180
Okay.

2764
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:42,820
I agree, you know, that the gaming industry should be unionized.

2765
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:49,500
But my issue is that some unions can be so powerful that it can screw over, you know,

2766
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:55,580
the everyday person, you know, and sometimes that union can also screw over to people that

2767
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:59,940
put money into it because I used to be a union guy working in a supermarket.

2768
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:04,340
And yes, the union will take care of you as any problems, any issues, take it to your

2769
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:05,340
shop steward.

2770
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:08,300
I was like that for the two weeks I worked at a grocery store.

2771
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,300
Mm hmm.

2772
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:11,620
So they will take care of you.

2773
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:17,440
I remember something had happened and they investigated and they looked at me like, well,

2774
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:19,020
we can't help you.

2775
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:20,520
Here is your last day.

2776
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,520
Here is your paycheck.

2777
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:25,260
And I'm just like, this incident was not even my fault.

2778
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:27,140
So how am I getting the blame?

2779
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:29,740
Oh, because I was on shift when it happened.

2780
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:33,400
So that's some bullshit.

2781
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:36,960
You bring up a good point, though, is that we talk about, you know, union, it does have

2782
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:42,280
to be the right union and it has to be done in a way where it's for the employees.

2783
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:47,240
That's also kind of why I and again, I do support the unionization of the industry,

2784
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,960
but I'm also at the mindset where I'm like, it's not going to happen overnight.

2785
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,040
It's not going to happen tomorrow.

2786
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,520
That is going to be a years long process.

2787
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:57,400
And also unions need to be smaller, I think.

2788
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:58,400
Right.

2789
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:03,520
And that's kind of why I'm like, we at least need these types of like legal defense funds

2790
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:10,080
or things that at least bring the people together as a bridge to that as the first step to kind

2791
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:15,160
of getting there, I think is is my my a little bit more, I think, I think realistic.

2792
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:18,560
I see realistic approach, but I kind of think that's where that's where it's coming from

2793
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,560
for me.

2794
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:21,000
No, I totally get that.

2795
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:25,500
And I remember, you know, like if I'm not mistaken in the United States, there's less

2796
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:30,500
than 10 Starbucks locations that are unionized and like three or four of them are in New

2797
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:33,860
York City.

2798
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:40,780
And like one of the big unions out here is a TWU 100 that handles the bus drivers and

2799
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:41,780
subway.

2800
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:46,060
And when they went on strike, basically that brought New York City to its knees because

2801
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:47,780
how are you going to get somewhere?

2802
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:48,780
You know.

2803
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:49,780
Mm hmm.

2804
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:52,940
And that's also the power of that union.

2805
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:53,940
That's true.

2806
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:54,940
Right.

2807
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:56,420
They had a New York cripple for about a week.

2808
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:58,820
They went back to the table.

2809
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:04,220
Contracts were hammered out by I do what you have to do that everybody else in the union

2810
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:10,180
gets their fair share, but at the same time, try not to, you know, put the screws to somebody,

2811
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:12,460
you know.

2812
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:18,180
Who is I even remotely related to it, and I can say this much if a gaming company is

2813
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:23,020
under a union and let's say, you know, they're at the table negotiating and there's issues

2814
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:24,540
with the contract.

2815
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:26,180
This company goes on strike.

2816
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:31,560
The most that will happen is a bunch of games will not be released for a lot of us.

2817
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:36,460
It's not a big deal because we have backlogs of we're used to it.

2818
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:37,460
Yeah.

2819
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:38,460
Basically.

2820
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:41,820
And for some, you got some who will be screaming and crying because they've been waiting for

2821
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:43,140
this game for so long.

2822
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:44,140
They want it now.

2823
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:49,140
And I'm like, look, I can wait another three weeks.

2824
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:50,140
Exactly.

2825
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:51,140
Exactly.

2826
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:59,420
Like, like when Cyberpunk got delayed, I'm like, well, I got more time to be delayed

2827
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:00,420
longer.

2828
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,420
Yeah.

2829
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:04,340
I'm waiting for that game to drop to 19 before I pick it up.

2830
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:09,180
So it just it does surprise me, especially when we're constantly making comparisons of

2831
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:13,440
the gaming industry to Hollywood and that, you know, that other artistic industry.

2832
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:18,320
And you look at Hollywood, there's unions up the wazoo that can bring that industry

2833
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,320
to its knees.

2834
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,320
Hello.

2835
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:24,520
Do you remember the Writers Guild strike that pretty much killed the TV show Heroes?

2836
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:26,380
That was pretty good.

2837
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:30,160
And then the Writers Guild strike kind of, you know, that all happened.

2838
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,160
And but I understand.

2839
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:34,800
I'm not saying I'm just saying that people remember it because of those types of things

2840
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,800
that happen.

2841
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:38,960
SAG-AFTRA, of course, is a huge one.

2842
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:43,500
Directors Guild, you know, you name it like there's unions for it in the Hollywood space.

2843
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:48,280
So it is weird to me that in the gaming space, which is quite frankly, a very similar industry,

2844
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:50,280
we don't have shit.

2845
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,280
Yeah.

2846
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:56,320
And like, I know I have friends that are in SAG-AFTRA and it's interesting, like, if they're

2847
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,320
since they're voice actors.

2848
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:59,320
We have some mutual friends.

2849
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:00,480
Yep, definitely.

2850
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:06,320
Some of them have to go under alternate names to do non-union stuff, you know, so it's kind

2851
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:07,320
of crazy.

2852
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:10,320
So, yeah.

2853
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:13,780
Another comment here from Mr. Chio 100 Matt, I think some industries need more representation

2854
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:16,680
from, say, a union rep than other industries.

2855
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,280
Gaming has gotten to the point where it needs it.

2856
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:22,120
Folks are being taken advantage of hours and night, rights wise, excuse me.

2857
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:24,720
If it means that some games take longer to make, then I'm all for it.

2858
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:28,060
At least the folks behind the game aren't sleeping under their desk working 60 hours

2859
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:29,060
a week.

2860
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:30,060
Preach.

2861
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:32,800
And I agree, nobody should be working that long.

2862
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:33,800
I mean, hell.

2863
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:34,800
It's unhealthy.

2864
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,560
I work in IT.

2865
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:40,400
You would think that it's normal nine to five.

2866
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:45,760
Sometimes we are there till late, you know, and thankfully most places I've worked at

2867
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,480
managers have come like, well, here's a voucher for food or here's this, here's that.

2868
02:25:50,480 --> 02:25:54,720
And I know people who have worked longer hours than I have who do on-sites and they don't

2869
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,480
even get that type of stuff, you know?

2870
02:25:57,480 --> 02:26:05,160
And thankfully with the IT I do, I'm glad that I'm doing what I do and not what you

2871
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:09,400
do, even though people.

2872
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:12,520
The funny thing is I love what I do.

2873
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:13,520
Yeah.

2874
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:14,520
And I love what I do.

2875
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:15,760
I'm like, I'm used to it.

2876
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:25,200
I'm like, I've had VIPs, VPs, SVPs, yelling at me over something that's not my fault.

2877
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,200
Fix it.

2878
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:31,400
Next thing you know, my manager's thanking me on, a long letter like this, thanking me

2879
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:32,400
for the work that I did.

2880
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,760
I'm just like, just doing my job.

2881
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:37,520
I like what Finara says, IT industry.

2882
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,560
You don't see the sun.

2883
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:41,720
You go in when it's dark and you get out when it's dark.

2884
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,640
That sounds like one of my jobs.

2885
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:48,200
Once we worked and we had the window covered up and a sign on the door that says, you must

2886
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,040
call the help desk if you need anything.

2887
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,160
About once in, we were told to take the sign down.

2888
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:58,080
Well, at least we could see the light of the outside windows, you know?

2889
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,080
Yeah.

2890
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:01,880
Well, and then when you do what I do, it's like, I don't need to call the help desk.

2891
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:03,520
I do this for a living.

2892
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,000
And then you have to call the help desk.

2893
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,760
I have been there working at another company.

2894
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,760
Well, we can't fix it here.

2895
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:15,600
We have to call retail IT to have them remote in, reboot it, and then we take it from there.

2896
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:20,800
It's just funny when you work, and I can't say where I work, I would get in a lot of

2897
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:27,320
trouble, but like when you have your own IT group for what you do, and then you also have

2898
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:28,840
to work with engineers.

2899
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,920
I completely understand.

2900
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:36,200
Since I no longer work for a company, I worked for about a year at Microsoft, so I completely

2901
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,200
understand.

2902
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,160
All right.

2903
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:45,760
Well, now this is turning into IT venting session, which is okay, but yeah.

2904
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:48,760
I'm sure both of us have stories.

2905
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:49,760
Right?

2906
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,760
Yeah.

2907
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:53,760
Don't make me get the pitos.

2908
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:59,480
Rama, before I wrap up, do you want to give us a cheap plug for Anime Jam Session, please

2909
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:00,480
do?

2910
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,480
Sure, definitely.

2911
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:05,600
Check us out at Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays at 9.30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Tuesday

2912
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:10,120
nights, and this week we'll be talking about what happened at Eddie Magic.

2913
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:12,800
The lines were up to two to three hours to get in.

2914
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:17,020
People were painting due to heat stroke.

2915
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:18,440
People were bringing water.

2916
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:22,960
They had a special section for people who are waiting for the EMT.

2917
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:30,200
It looked like, imagine walking in the AX three years ago with what's going on right

2918
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:31,200
now.

2919
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:33,080
That's how it looked inside.

2920
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,080
Oh.

2921
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:38,120
Did I ever tell you about Sacramento Pride 2019?

2922
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,120
No.

2923
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:47,960
They were overcrowded, actually a lot of the EMTs were being pulled away, and people were

2924
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:51,160
having heat stroke left and right, but people were trying to stay to see Lizzo.

2925
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:53,200
I was like, that was the Lizzo concert, wasn't it?

2926
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,200
That was a Lizzo concert.

2927
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:58,360
That was way too big of a name for that venue.

2928
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:04,760
But yeah, you've got to have, you have to anticipate the worst case scenario, especially

2929
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:05,760
at an anime con.

2930
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:06,760
I mean, please.

2931
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:07,760
Yeah.

2932
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:12,200
I think this is like their first year, so of course mistakes will happen, but this is

2933
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:13,200
like-

2934
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,600
This is mistakes that could really hurt people.

2935
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:16,600
Exactly.

2936
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,600
Exactly.

2937
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,600
All right.

2938
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:20,560
Well, tune in on Tuesday night for more.

2939
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:25,760
Rama, so happy to have you here as one of our first callers here in this revitalized

2940
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,440
call-in segment here on OLR.

2941
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,520
I like your shirt.

2942
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:29,920
Big hearts for you as well.

2943
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:30,920
All right.

2944
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:31,920
Here's mine.

2945
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:35,240
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

2946
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:36,240
Love it.

2947
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,240
All right, my friend.

2948
02:29:37,240 --> 02:29:38,240
We'll see you next time.

2949
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:39,240
All right.

2950
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,240
Thanks for being here.

2951
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,240
Take care, buddy.

2952
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,240
Stay fabulous.

2953
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:43,240
You too.

2954
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:44,240
All right.

2955
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,240
Bye.

2956
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:46,240
All right.

2957
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:52,120
You know what that made me remember is Slidekick's old podcast, Fabulous Flames.

2958
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:53,680
Oh, my husband was on that podcast.

2959
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,680
Fabulous Flames.

2960
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:55,680
That's right.

2961
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,680
Oh, that's right.

2962
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:57,920
It was the best.

2963
02:29:57,920 --> 02:29:59,560
It was the best name.

2964
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,560
It really was.

2965
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:05,360
And anytime someone thinks it says fabulous, I think of that podcast to this day.

2966
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:07,600
It's really a shame it's not still around.

2967
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:09,840
I mean, none of those people play wow anymore.

2968
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,700
And I'll just I'll spill tea.

2969
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,720
Their third host was such a negative Nancy.

2970
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:14,720
I couldn't stand it.

2971
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:20,120
Like, don't do a show about a game if you're just going to shit on the game.

2972
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:22,960
But do not piss in my cornflakes.

2973
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:23,960
Piss in somebody else's.

2974
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:28,520
I loved hearing Alan and Slidekick talk about wow and all that.

2975
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,160
It's gone too soon.

2976
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:31,160
Pour one out.

2977
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:33,360
I see Alan's in the kitchen, but he has his earbuds in.

2978
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:34,520
So he's listening to something else.

2979
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:35,520
It's not this program.

2980
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,520
Hi, Alan.

2981
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:38,240
Oh, he heard that one.

2982
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,240
Hi.

2983
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:40,240
We're just talking about you.

2984
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:42,640
Alan, do you remember Fabulous Flames?

2985
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:46,280
Yeah, he just made this face.

2986
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:47,280
He made this face.

2987
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:48,280
So I'm going to try to read.

2988
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:49,280
Sorry, podcast.

2989
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:50,280
I'm going to do this back of the camera.

2990
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:52,280
He made this face like this.

2991
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,280
Yes.

2992
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:54,600
Alright.

2993
02:30:54,600 --> 02:31:00,280
Anyway, um, let's see.

2994
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:03,960
I think we might have touched on our last minute stories already, but I will ask Dark

2995
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:08,320
Soccer if there's anything else she wants to bring up here for last minute stories.

2996
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:15,120
Um, well, it's not really like a big news thing, but it's something I do want to warn

2997
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:17,960
my fellow DVD players.

2998
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:20,320
The disconnect penalty is back.

2999
02:31:20,360 --> 02:31:23,520
I noticed that on some streams I was watching.

3000
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,360
Yes, yes, for sure.

3001
02:31:25,360 --> 02:31:26,360
All right.

3002
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:27,360
Um, okay.

3003
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:28,880
Uh, that's it.

3004
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:31,800
We're going to wrap up, get some final thoughts, but first I'm going to tell you, thank you

3005
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:35,760
so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio or Listening Live and, uh, tuning into the

3006
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,200
show and supporting us.

3007
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,900
If you liked what you heard here on the show, please tell a friend or two, help us spread

3008
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:43,440
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3009
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:45,520
But if the gamers aren't here, we can't share their voices.

3010
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:48,920
Like we just had Rama on a minute ago to share his voice and we hope to get more of you in

3011
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:49,920
the coming weeks.

3012
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:53,280
So thank you so much to those of you that were here in chat tonight and of course everybody

3013
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:58,120
who downloads the show throughout the week on iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever

3014
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:01,720
it is you listen to podcasts on, thank you so much for, uh, putting Orange Launch Radio

3015
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:04,040
in your rotation and being a part of the show.

3016
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:11,560
Uh, if you feel so inclined, you can always, uh, shop our merch store, uh, over at vognetwork.com

3017
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:18,500
slash uh, shop if you'd like to do that and, um, I think that's, that's all I have to say

3018
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:19,540
for my cheap plugs.

3019
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:23,060
So, uh, thank you, SJ100Matt for sending that, uh, link out there.

3020
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:24,060
So thank you again.

3021
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:25,060
Uh, final thoughts.

3022
02:32:25,060 --> 02:32:27,180
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

3023
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:31,060
I want people to stay with me tonight while I play because it gets really lonely playing

3024
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:32,060
by myself.

3025
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:33,060
Pretty please?

3026
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:34,060
All right.

3027
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:38,820
I got to edit the show or it won't get done sadly.

3028
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:40,900
I try to try to kind of have it running on my phone though.

3029
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:41,900
Well that, that's fine.

3030
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:42,900
Rob, you get a pass.

3031
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:43,900
Okay.

3032
02:32:43,900 --> 02:32:44,900
Yeah.

3033
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:47,660
But, um, but, uh, I am going to go ahead and turn off my camera cause I have to set up

3034
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,700
the OBS cameras.

3035
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:50,220
So no worries.

3036
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:51,220
So take care.

3037
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:52,220
We'll see you next time.

3038
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:53,220
Dark Soccer.

3039
02:32:53,220 --> 02:33:00,000
And then my final thought for tonight is, um, I don't know, I'm, I'm, I hope this thing

3040
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,240
heals up cause there's an ingress thing I want to go to Wednesday and I'd like to actually

3041
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:04,980
be able to socialize with people.

3042
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:09,940
Um, except if I still have all these bandages on my neck, I don't know how, uh, easily possible

3043
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:10,940
that's going to be.

3044
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:13,620
Uh, so we'll just take it as it comes.

3045
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:18,020
Anyway, uh, thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3046
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:20,060
Uh, I hope you all have a wonderful week.

02:33:20,060 --> 02:33:22,460
Happy gaming, whatever it is you decide to play.

3048
