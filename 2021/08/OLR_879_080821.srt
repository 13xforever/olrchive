1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,420
If there's one downside to an unexpected and massive spike in success, it's that

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,420
when things go back to normal it can look worse by comparison.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,540
That quote this week applies to Nintendo whose 2021 looks quote unquote worse year over year

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,660
because Animal Crossing, the third biggest selling game last year has no equal for Nintendo

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,860
so far this year.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,100
A completely obvious quote and yet rarely considered when it matters.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,580
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki to bring you everything

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,580

32
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,620
crazy but he's he's he's kind of grown up to be a little gamer just like you right he plays a lot of

33
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,780
like Minecraft and all that stuff I mean you talk about that a little bit on the show he's doing all

34
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,660
the prickly roadblocks roblox all roadblocks yeah does he create in roblox because I know he was

35
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,820
going to um those coding classes um pre-covid he went he went well he he did actually go to

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,180
a summer camp not that long ago like I think sometime in July um to learn how to make levels

37
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,740
and uh worlds and roblox I don't think he does anything with it he just basically plays I don't

38
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,420
they play a lot of this thing called Brookhaven which is kind of like a roleplay game mm-hmm but

39
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,100
not like a traditional roleplay game it's like I'm gonna pretend to be a high school student you

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,260
know type of thing or um I don't know my son just my my younger son keeps talking about it all the

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,860
time he watches this guy um omg I guess who's on youtube that there's like lore in the game

42
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,540
about this agency or something I don't know so they they kind of go between that and there's

43
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,820
this other ninja game that they play it's kind of like a it's not a clicker game per se but it's

44
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:10,220
it's like that set up you know where you grind something and then you can you kind of prestige

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,780
or whatever and you get more you know bonuses towards earning in-game money and stuff like that

46
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:25,500
see I remember Becky's son was into this pirate 101 mmo for kids I that and that's different than

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,900
puzzle pirates which I think we all played at one point or another I actually didn't play puzzle

48
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,980
pirates oh you didn't I thought you did at one point nope okay I thought about it and never did

49
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,820
like I am with many a game it's it's interesting though to hear how like 11 year olds are are you

50
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,900
know exploring through things like um you know the pirate 101 or uh roblox or minecraft or whatever

51
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,940
because here comes uncle roberts back in my day I don't know about you guys but we had neo pets

52
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,060
and Gaia online we didn't even have that shit I'm talking about when like I was 11 and 12 we didn't

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,500
have any of that shit on Commodore 64 you know we had we had pen and paper and so we would draw

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,060
our little dungeons on the pen and paper complete with like the item store that you could shop at

55
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,660
beforehand and we would draw I know some of you kids did this too that like you draw out the thing

56
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,580
and like your little like here's where you start here's the final boss here's the pit of something

57
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,020
and whatever and then it's it's basically dnd without dice and like your own house rules it's

58
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,620
basically that that's that's what we did without roblox has we used to use the study lab though

59
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,820
this is when I was a senior in high school my friend Ashley and I would make up our own rpg

60
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,780
and then we would just spend an hour role playing um now I will say uh when I was around 13 in

61
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,500
junior high and I guess I would be like 12 we did play scorched earth on lunch break in the science

62
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,740
lab like the science teacher loved it he let us come in there and take over the computers like as

63
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,900
long as like he he would kind of like walk around and just make sure we weren't like looking at porn

64
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,980
or something or you know whatever but like when he saw that we were just nerds shooting each other

65
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,220
with tanks he was like all right these kids are fine these kids are gonna be okay and look at me

66
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:12,380
now look at you little did he know I'd actually love to see how that guy's doing he was he was

67
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,500
Mr Abe if you're out there give me a holler you never know you know what's funny is that after

68
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,780
I graduated high school I actually in the phone book looked up my french teacher to wish her a

69
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,500
pleasant Bastille day you know my my one of my favorite teachers ever was one of my math teachers

70
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,620
in junior high school and my mom ran into her at the mall right before it's probably about a year

71
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,340
before my mom passed she ran into her at the the mall out in Roseville and I guess they had like

72
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,900
they she recognized the teacher and they had a pleasant conversation and I remember right when

73
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,260
I graduated high school she had had a baby and my mom was like she had a teenage daughter with her

74
00:06:51,260 --> 00:07:03,020
and I was like that baby grew up well I stayed in contact with my favorite teacher after I

75
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,700
graduated and we were friends on Facebook and chatted for a while and she sadly passed away

76
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:16,940
a couple of years ago yeah that's hard to hear yeah but she was almost another mother to me

77
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,180
yeah and I bawled when I found out but she was an absolute angel of a human being

78
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,260
and was one of those teachers that truly cared about her students on a different level you know

79
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,380
what I mean mm-hmm I hear you like she invested well it was also the gifted classes but you know

80
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,860
so she didn't have like a whole lot of us at a time but she really invested a lot of effort into

81
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,380
us and and so hats off to the teachers out there in the OLR crowd hats off to you those of you that

82
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,180
are out there making a difference thank thank you for what you do unless you're mean to the kids

83
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,140
but I don't think any of you are I really don't unless you're my sixth grade algebra teacher where

84
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,140
you're kind of cool dude but you're also kind of a dick or my high school biology teacher who is

85
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,260
who is not a pleasant person but you know what we're not gonna let one bad egg ruin the entire

86
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,980
you know whatever whatever analogy I was going for though we don't let one ruin it for the the

87
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,020

143
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
on a stage and you're down below it's not that interesting and i think that's what many people

144
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,660
thought this was going to be in fortnite and i'm here to tell the other concerts that they've had

145
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,460
there have been like that i'm here to tell you something changed here i don't know if it's

146
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:51,100
because of of the power that ariana grande has the impact the uh the numbers the cultural iconery

147
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,020
of ariana grande or what it is but it was not that in fact i found the concert experience to

148
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,700
be kind of an artistic experience and it's something very interesting for video games

149
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,700
and that's why i wanted to bring it up so what happened the concert was only about 12 minutes

150
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,060
um obviously i can't show it to you here because some of the audio would get into dmca issues and

151
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,460
i don't even know the visuals might but so just and plus we're a podcast anyway i don't want the

152
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,860
folks listening on the podcast feed to feel left out so i would encourage you go look up you know

153
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,740
a video of what was going on with this thing and basically what happened there was a whole like um

154
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,580
it was like kind of like an experience type of thing your car so it's all run in the fortnite

155
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,380
engine but your characters get teleported to these scenes that kind of go with some of the

156
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,140
different songs that are playing like before ariana comes out there's one where you're kind of

157
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,540
like bouncing around on some different flowers you know in the scene or whatever and then there's

158
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,180
another one where you go into a mini game where you're like shooting planes and stuff like that

159
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,620
and you're like on the plane and then everybody kind of like crashes i don't know and you have

160
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,700
to like revive people and that's when ariana comes out and she she also is like kind of like revived

161
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:09,020
and she starts singing um yeah players are strapped into planes and then there was a whole sequence

162
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,940
where there was a what they're calling mc escher kind of like stairs and pillars where um she's

163
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,100
kind of slowly walking up the stairs and she has this big hammer and she's singing one of her

164
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:26,620
songs she's actually singing the duet she did with um mac miller who passed away um a few years ago

165
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,580
and obviously that was very you know tragic for for her um and a lot of people saw that as a

166
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,740
tribute to him like she was climbing up a stairway to like heaven or something to like i don't know

167
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,540
knock on the door or however you want to interpret that the point is this was a very she just went

168
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,220
from zeppelin to dylan this it was a very artistic thing and you know if we're going to continue this

169
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,980
conversation about video games or art i'm here to say i'm just as shocked as anyone else honestly

170
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,420
that fortnite and ariana grande brought us this very artistic kind of really neat thing this past

171
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,900
week i need to find this on youtube or something you really should it and it and again i stress

172
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,620
it has yes the ariana grande skin is in fortnite and you can go play fortnite with that this thing

173
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,420
was none of that this this had nothing to do with fortnite except for the fact that it was

174
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,580
running in the same engine and therefore we had a lot of the same emotes a lot of the same ways to

175
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:25,180
move around and things like that but it was not a you know one versus 100 type of thing so um

176
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,820
it's really interesting i i i'm curious did anybody in chat actually check this out or see it

177
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,540
and did you kind of take away the same impression i did that like this could be this this is a

178
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,620
really interesting direction for fortnite because i know we've heard in the past like within the

179
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,340
past couple months right like fortnite and i think a lot of this might have come with the epic and

180
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,940
apple thing or whatever whatever whatever we've heard a lot from epic the past few months but i

181
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,460
feel like epic has talked a lot about how they don't see themselves as a game as much as they

182
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:05,180
see themselves as like a pop culture or a pop and we we were all kind of sitting here going what

183
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,300
it's it's a fucking game it's fortnite like don't like you're not taking yourself like

184
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,940
just accept what you are fortnite and now that i've seen this i'm kind of like oh

185
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,900
i see where they might be trying to go with this like fortnite is the canvas upon which this event

186
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,340
was sort of drawn honestly so um let's see sg100 matt says i didn't and i kind of want to watch the

187
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,700
video for it now yeah check it out it was only like honestly when all said and done it was only

188
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,660
like 14 minutes start to finish like it's not a long concert in the traditional sense it really

189
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,140
felt more like an interactive music video quite honestly because i don't think she was performing

190
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,140
it live or anything like that it really just sounded like it was the studio recordings to

191
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,940
be honest um tiger claw on chat says fortnite is more like a game that's a service i think

192
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:02,140
yeah that's probably a big part of it as well um let's see uh tryna see uh up in chat as well

193
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:10,060
interesting sg100 matt says fortnite is more mtv than mtv this is like kind of revolutionary in

194
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,180
terms of music video type of sphere that's what i'm saying that's why this thing kind of took me

195
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,860
by surprise i wasn't expecting it i was expecting ariana grande up on the stage doing some twirls

196
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,580
singing you know maybe either a new recording or something of some of her greatest hits

197
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,540
and then you know but spend twenty dollars on my dlc thank you bye thank you next you know that's

198
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:38,780
that's it but it wasn't that at all um yeah let's see uh and yyr of course is bringing up the music

199
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,300
game related news here yes ariana grande is also related to the music games and ddr uh ariana

200
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,380
grande was in ddr except break free was cut from ddr last month after being in the game for five

201
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,700
years whoops the licensing ran out that's no fun now that uh now that the game is mandatory to be

202
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:03,580
online um bobby blackwolf in chat says i've seen some of these music video experiences in the past

203
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,020
but none have been as big as this the chain smokers did a psvr experience for one of their

204
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:16,780
new singles yeah i saw a psvr thing for i think it was utada hikaru uh they did something for

205
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,460
uh kingdom hearts it was like a live studio show where they were singing um one of the kingdom

206
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,940
heart songs and you could look at it in vr um and i've also seen the literal vr music videos like

207
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,500
i think it was bjork did a vr music video or it was like a youtube 360 like really close type of

208
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,620
thing so it's yeah there have been those experiences but still there was this this felt different than

209
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,100
any of that um is that it really just felt like it was an entire it kind of you know what it it

210
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,660
actually reminds me of i'm gonna throw it way back do you remember on the old school computers

211
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,860
especially the commodore 64 but i'm sure this was done a little bit on apple 2e's and stuff too but

212
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,820
especially the commodore 64 because of the sound chip and the particular unique sound and music

213
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:13,180
that that did do you remember the demo scene and the demos that would come out bobby i know you're

214
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,540
gonna light up with this i know that was that was your scene when you were younger that's what this

215
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:24,860
ariana thing reminded me of is that and those those um demo things would be like a like a song

216
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,500
might play and you would see like a it would like push the graphic chips to do something on the

217
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,780
screen and then like maybe a different part of the song it switches a little bit go look up like an

218
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,460
old school like happy holidays commodore 64 compilation or something to see like what

219
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,380
you know it's so show different scenes of the holidays what would play different like um

220
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,620
christmas carols and things like that uh bobby says really it was about the amiga for the demo

221
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,020
scene that's right the amiga really stepped that up even more and bobby points out of course the

222
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,300
pc demos yes that was still a thing even in the 90s and um i think that name is showing up black

223
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,420
on black yes it's jason hi it's our voiceover man jason saying demo scene is still very much alive

224
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,820
as niche as it ever was honest and i i hope nobody hates me for this comment because it's actually

225
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,620
meant to be a compliment the ariana grande concert felt like a mainstream demo scene project

226
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:27,900
honestly it's honestly what it felt like to me so um jason it might be the way things are set up

227
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,820
on my computer your name is black and it's just i'm on night mode over here so it's coming up on

228
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,060
a black background i wouldn't worry too much about it um let's see zen monkey 11 in chat says i go to

229
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,500
concerts in alt space vr they have holograms in there so you see the real artist in vr in

230
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,180
front of you not on a screen zara larson did a roblox mini concert the metaverse is real and

231
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,380
it's here i'm all for it saw the ariana concert inside of fortnite i try to experience them all

232
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:01,020
it's cool yeah now that i've seen this one like if another artist does one that i that i like or even

233
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,980
like kind of like like like for i i'm kind of into little nos x right now because i think i

234
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,180
i love how he's pushing people's buttons right now and the music videos and stuff you know it's like

235
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:20,140
fortnite is more playstation home than playstation home is you know because it could be like this is

236
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,020
like kind of you know you have this world that exists that you put stuff into it like these

237
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,300
different media pieces and stuff whereas if sony were smart they would bring that playstation home

238
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,540
but since they haven't um you have these types of venues now where artists can you can have

239
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:43,020
different crossovers with artists and properties and all sorts of licensing i didn't even think

240
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,780
about that but you're you're you're you're right on that um cia tabirian chat says i mean i know

241
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,900
there were some stand-up comedians who were doing comedy shows and animal crossing well yeah i mean

242
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,820
especially especially because of the nature of the pandemic and animal crossing really hitting at the

243
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:06,780
right time i mean the kk concerts are a staple of animal crossing now you know obviously i still

244
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,540
miss him though doing his thing in the um you know in the coffee shop because we need the coffee shop

245
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,580
back yes we do you put that side by side with the ariana thing and it looks a little sad but

246
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,900
i mean it's it's it's still it is what it is for that game and it was kind of like

247
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,580
it warped you out of the traditional world and had that credit sequence you know as basic as

248
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,820
it is it was still something kind of interesting and different um jason our voiceover guy is uh

249
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,100
continuing with a comment about way back in the day beastie boys did a live internet concert back

250
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:45,820
in the 90s i'm talking like real video era quality and it was just a single camera angle with audio

251
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,340
of course yeah yeah that's that's like a streamed concert type of thing and honestly again i think

252
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,940
that's what a lot of us expected from this but it really was different um you have low-key

253
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,580
playstations missing out from not rebooting home but at the same time playstations really trying

254
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,140
to push itself is like the place you want to be playing fortnite even though fortnite is available

255
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,340
literally everywhere else except you know that that little spat epic has going on right now but

256
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,500
we're gonna we're gonna overlook that it's available a variety of different places than

257
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,580
just in most places most places yes so um st100 matt says i don't think playstation home had

258
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,700
concerts but i feel like there was a watch a long or listen along communities i kind of remember

259
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,260
there was watch longs in the olr house in home but then sony updated the game where no media

260
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,460
could be played at home yeah there was a lot of potential in home that really went unrealized

261
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,820
like i feel like just when home was kind of like finding its rhythm and where it could belong and

262
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,100
really blossom somebody just pulled the plug and like on on like the development front it was like

263
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,740
no we're not spending another dime on trying to make this better or trying to establish some of

264
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,460
the copyright issues or things like that like i really think they just they really yanked that and

265
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:05,180
now fortnite even though fortnite doesn't really feel like home to me but i i i get that comparison

266
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,580
i get why you're saying that um zeba in chat says synth riders oh yeah that vr game you brought up

267
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,180
in the email has three experience songs that you are inside a vr version of the music video of the

268
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,140
artist much like in the background of ddr oh that sounds neat that sounds kind of interesting it's

269
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,580
different way to do it uh and bonds 006 says i would go back into home i i would absolutely

270
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,900
give home a second chance i'm really surprised they didn't bring it back with the vr i thought

271
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,460
for sure that was something they were gonna do was try to take on the vr chat second life type

272
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,100
of angle but for whatever reason they didn't so um interesting yeah as jonah matt says ps home was

273
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,940
both the butt end of jokes at its time and also way ahead of its time there's things like that

274
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:57,340
in gaming um that just one versus 100 on xbox i'll say that i'll say that until you pull the plug on

275
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,300
this show that thing was way ahead of its time hell even the things that preceded it and the

276
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:09,020
berkeley uh games online like acrophobia and stuff like that that was you know that was huge

277
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:15,180
anyway so we'll see what had any any artists that you would want to see in fortnite with an

278
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,180
interactive visual experience you know i have to ask this what artist do you want to see in

279
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,220
fortnite with an interactive visual experience i feel like i don't listen to a lot of like modern

280
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,300
music so i i i'm going back to what i said earlier like a little nos x because he's really pushing

281
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,780
the buttons with things right now i'd like to see somebody who's kind of known for reinventions

282
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:41,100
like maybe madonna i'd be very curious um and uh if it's in fortnite she wouldn't need her walker

283
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,500
just kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding come on all right anyway

284
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,980
uh oh gaga of course who who wouldn't who wouldn't go to a gaga concert even this even the straight

285
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,700
people would want to see a gaga concert in fortnite because she's a heck of a performer

286
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,380
that would be really great uh any any oh oh i like that answer sg100 matt says daft punk

287
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,540
but they're broken up and i feel like they did one over already well hell if they ever reunited

288
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,900
that would be a heck of a thing to do that's for sure any any thoughts on on a fortnite experience

289
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,260
dark soccer or loki yeah i have two widely different things okay go for it oh well good

290
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,300
okay go would be interesting because they do like their uh seamless videos and stuff it's pretty

291
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,620
interesting makes it a completely separate side of the spectrum death lock

292
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,100
all right i i'm all for a guar concert in fortnite let's see that happen

293
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:47,100
dark dark soccer how about you i want a gorillas one gorillas of course oh god the bands that are

294
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,220
kind of technically inclined to begin with that makes a lot of exactly that are animated to begin

295
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,300
with yeah yeah absolutely why i kind of you know why i say tech inclined because there's a lot of

296
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,380
tech that goes into the concerts and stuff like that that's a great answer um Hatsune Miku why not

297
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,900
also that i think has been done you're right i think that has been done uh bobby bobby blackwolf

298
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,140
says the tupac hologram in fortnite which was similar i think that could be dangerous

299
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:20,060
um orange right says a weirdo concert fuck yes oh you know weirdo would do it hell yes i love it

300
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,940
all right win-win all right let's move on since my co-host did not attend the concert in fortnite

301
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,100
but to be fair neither did i i watched it uh i watched a wrap-up summary just because i was

302
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,180
curious and everybody on social media was saying it was great and i was like i have to see what

303
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,500
was so great about it and then i watched it i was like oh this is not what i was expecting at all

304
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,620
so um we were playing video games and too busy not to go to virtual concerts so what kind of

305
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,300
video games have you been playing this week we'll start with dark sakura how was your gaming week

306
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,100
i played dead by daylight of course you did you played you were playing i beat

307
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,580
phantasian you were playing at one in the morning this morning dead by day well because my um

308
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:09,020
my stream time for uh i actually go live at midnight now after such this early sunday and uh

309
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:17,580
i mean i just play until like maybe 2 33 in the morning um i had some good people in last night

310
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,420
actually got a raid like right before i was about to sign off i don't know why happens it

311
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,980
i'm on my last game and people raid me and it's all good it's always happens to me too

312
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,180
so i played another round that i didn't do as great in but i made rank 13 last night which

313
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,780
for me is a big deal because i always feel like i completely suck at the game but i'm pretty okay

314
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:43,660
with pig so i like pig i think you it is you i was just gonna say you called it out on your stream

315
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,300
when i was watching it's it's it's the fact that you have to kind of use a trackball i think kind

316
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,900
of like you're not able to be as fluid as some in some motions or at least you're working up to that

317
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,500
still and i think once that kind of gets a little more and i think you're only your pig game i

318
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,180
watched last night games actually were way improved from what i'd seen back in the when

319
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,860
you first started so i mean i was whipping stuff but i was also super super tired when i was

320
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:20,380
playing but um i figured out my way of countering you know the upfront 360 and i don't know if you

321
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:28,300
noticed that i was doing this but i would chase get close and stop because at the point that i

322
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,500
know that 360 is about to happen they will just turn and run right into me because i stopped

323
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,300
that's like a nurse that teleports like they start their teleport and then as soon as the

324
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,380
survivor runs around they teleport into the ground so that they don't actually move forward

325
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,100
it's kind of a similar thing yeah i i did actually get the idea from watching lc

326
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:58,620
and our uh our everyone's favorite you know nurse one trick but uh i got the idea watching and then

327
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:06,940
i was thinking i can't turn that quickly with the trackball but why don't i just stop i've never

328
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,660
seen anyone do that except playing nurse so i was like why don't i just stop i think that's

329
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,140
clever i think the more you find those workarounds that are unexpected the more you're going to see

330
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,180
the rewards that come from that yeah no one expects you to stop like i actually got a

331
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:31,020
compliment on it from a jake player the other day um it was one of my uh offline games and

332
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,820
he was he was like you're the first killer i've ever seen just stop and let me run into you

333
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,940
and i was like well i have to use a thumb trackball because i have bad wrists we were

334
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,620
just chatting about it and he's like also are you a microsoft star like no i'm on stadia because i

335
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,340
play on a mac and so we got into a little discussion about it and like in that match

336
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:56,860
like he was like rake four and we started talking about it and he just flat out said hey i'm gonna

337
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:04,220
i'm gonna borrow this idea for my killer games there you go i was like cool i'm glad i'm glad

338
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,420
to be of service but um and i've actually started talking through like some of my thought processes

339
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:15,020
while i play and why i do the things that i do and talking it out and getting advice from people in

340
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:21,020
my chat really i think helped me do better and i've also had my builds look at looked at by

341
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:27,340
a few players that i trust so i've gotten some really good advice and i want to actually give

342
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:34,780
a thank you to to lc to hydro to nick and prince uh a few people out there who's given uh laurie

343
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:41,180
bird gave me really good advice on my builds nice and i'm also playing wordscapes because i'm a word

344
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:50,780
nerd a word nerd all right loki how was your gaming week or weeks as it is uh well it was

345
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:59,260
all minecraft um so it was i don't know it was a lot of just like kind of grinding to get stuff

346
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,660
done and um i was doing a lot of i was cutting some videos together so like i did a tutorial

347
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,540
video i think last week maybe it was this week i don't know everything's starting to blend together

348
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,220
um so i did tutorial video to try to drive some more views to my channel so i put that out and

349
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,540
and that was pretty successful because there was um it was all about timing because there was an

350
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,380
episode that bdubs had done on hermitcraft where he did a two in one like stone generator and i'm

351
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,340
like i bet i can make that three in one stone generator because um it should be pretty easy

352
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:38,220
to add uh basalt to it so i did i i put out a design that's based sort of like on his not

353
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,940
exactly the way he did it but like a similar looking design and added that in there so i was

354
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,180
trying to help you know promote myself that way so that it's it's got okay views i mean so it

355
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,340
you know it's working there and then i'm working on my latest episode um pretty soon so in that one

356
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:04,700
i built this because we have issues on our servers still with mob spawns it's an issue with the

357
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,780
software server runs it's not vanilla minecraft it's like paper which is like a sort of modded

358
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,340
server um it fixes some bugs it also introduces new bugs and so because of that there's a bug

359
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,500
with uh mobs spawning correctly so if i'm on the server by myself or i'm on the server with

360
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,700
somebody else and they're in another dimension for me there's no mobs spawning whatsoever in my

361
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:36,300
farm so it makes it really hard to run shops on our server and so i had to create a a cash for

362
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,140
gold store to get people to sell me gold so i can use it in my gold farm um and so that was

363
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:49,020
a fun build i made it look like a rundown you know strip mall store so um so that'll be my new video

364
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,460
and then um yeah so it's been just a lot of that a lot of this week just kind of um

365
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,300
i don't know i don't even know what i've been working on i think a lot of it's just been afk

366
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,500
in in the server oh and then also working on other projects for people on the server as well so

367
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,620
there's some other things um tied with that but i'm trying to get more on track to put out stuff

368
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:17,020
in a regular basis i mean i have been putting up videos about once a week but it's not my normal

369
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,340
smp let's play stuff it's been kind of you know here and there so still trying to get that down

370
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:29,660
faster but making progress all right well best of luck on the youtube front make sure make sure

371
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:36,060
y'all are following loki on youtube at loki olr on youtube yep all right uh my gaming week honestly

372
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,580
i've been playing mostly a lot of the same stuff i've been talking about in previous weeks on the

373
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,620
show uh myself i'm still you know uh moving along in dead by daylight i did a random stream on my

374
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,340
own channel on friday that was that was fun except uh jamie you've expressed this too like when when

375
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,060
the camera's on i have all bad games and then when the camera's off is when i have my good games

376
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:59,180
although i did i had my one trick bill game um because i had a daily that i had to like get an

377
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,460
item and escape as bill well bill was like level one so i ran i ran i was like screw it let's do

378
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:12,300
i ran a game with uh bill with one talent uh borrowed time and oh billiam i did it i i i

379
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,580
opened the exit door and escaped that was not the item and escape it was the exit door to scare i

380
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,500
opened the exit door and escaped so uh yeah and it was funny because when that happened it was

381
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,900
pod culture somebody started spamming that icon from your channel with the the bill with the slash

382
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,620
through it i'm like hey you mean the one that i'm doing right now yes in chat so yeah there's that

383
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:36,780
um i was playing some fun fast c14 last night uh yakuza like a dragon i kind of hit a wall

384
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,700
uh those of you that played the game i hit that three million yen wall you all know what i'm

385
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,900
talking about um and uh so it's it slowed me down a little bit but i am gonna try to uh pick that

386
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,620
up because i'm too close to finishing it and too invested in the story to not finish it um

387
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,420
i also just some random new stuff was showing up on game pass i was like oh i want to play that

388
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:02,300
again so for example luminous is on game pass now i love luminous i know it's so good it's the

389
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,220
remastered version of the original so it has shine in which is like you know the best one of the best

390
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,420
songs i've ever had in that game you mean the best song what well there was a holla back girl

391
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,740
and luminous too let's not get crazy all right here's the thing that pissed me off though you

392
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:23,500
know how you have to get to level 100 to um basically beat the normal i got to level 94

393
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:29,500
it took me an hour to get there and then i choked i was so mad but i'll just have to play it again

394
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,860
um katamari damashi reroll is also on game pass i downloaded it but i haven't played that yet so

395
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,260
that's all i can really say about that right now but here's the new thing i want to talk about that

396
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,140
i actually tried this week um that is kind of interesting so i out of the blue got a message

397
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:51,580
on my xbox inbox that said you're invited to test out the xcloud service at xbox.com slash play

398
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,340
so uh i did and i'm giving you that url because it's uh it's pretty one easy one to remember and

399
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,180
maybe you have it you don't know it so check it out um and so i went to um check it out and it's

400
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,100
based it is their cloud-based service it's basically their stadia okay but it's it's in

401
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:13,820
the xbox environment um and if you have game pass then you can just fire up any of the game pass

402
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,340
games on there otherwise you can fire up um things that i i think i think it might only be

403
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,260
game pass games but i can't remember if it's things that you own in the cloud but it's only

404
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:30,220
certain games that have the permission which i think mostly overlaps with um uh uh game pass

405
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,820
uh mike defton chat says uh welcome to the xcloud gang rob i barely use it i had to try it out i

406
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,020
wanted to see so the first game i played of course was no man's sky because i feel like that is a

407
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,140
good benchmark game for me a i've played a fucking lot of it b i've played it on pretty much every

408
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:55,020
platform no i i i'm not i've played it playstation 4 playstation vr xbox 360 xbox one xbox series i'm

409
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,780
sorry not the 360 what am i saying the xbox one the xbox series x uh steam i've played that game

410
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,540
a lot of different places um i played that on the invidious thing too so i played it on xcloud a

411
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:15,420
little bit um and it was i would say it was um it was fine but i think stadia might be a little more

412
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:21,500
responsive i think the technology might be a little bit crisper on stadia i don't know if

413
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:28,540
it's just that they've had more time to perfect it or whatever the case is um but um i it wasn't

414
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,580
bad by any means it's just i would notice the artifacting a little more and especially when i

415
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,820
was turning in these heavily graphical areas like my game save was on the um the anomaly which is a

416
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,740
pretty graphically intensive area i could notice like it did seem to lag a little bit so um but but

417
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,700
it wasn't like it didn't make the game unplayable by any means but i i think for that particular

418
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,940
game i would just continue to play my xbox series x version why wouldn't i but the other game i

419
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:04,460
played i played doom the 2016 reboot um and again i did notice some of the stuff with the artifacting

420
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,140
and maybe some of the colors weren't quite as vibrant but i did definitely notice it was

421
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:16,300
streaming 60 frames a second and it was smooth and especially a game like that doom which is

422
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,740
very fast pace like it actually went a little bit through the first level to kind of get a feel for

423
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,820
it and i was kind of like this does play really well for like a cloud-based thing so although i

424
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,700
would say in my evaluation this the stadia technology was a little bit ahead of where

425
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,700
xbox was at i still think it's really exciting it's not bad by any means and i think where this

426
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:45,020
is really going to shine is being able to test games before you spend like 80 gigs downloading

427
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,100
them because you know that doom reboot is like a 40 gig downloader maybe 50 i don't even more

428
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,580
well why not stream a little bit and sure streaming is going to take up bandwidth too

429
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,900
but streaming for 15 30 minutes is only going to be it's not going to be a like even a gig

430
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,180
you know to test the game a little bit out and see what you think about it and then make a decision

431
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,380
from there and i think it's also great for these things where it's like uh sometimes in the xbox

432
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,940
rewards it's like you need to get an achievement in one of these 10 games and i'm like i don't want

433
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,980
to download one of those 10 games now i could just do it through the cloud gaming so i'm really

434
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,700
excited too to see what happens when the cloud gaming hits the actual xbox series x i think

435
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,820
that will be very very interesting um as 100 matt says i also got that invite as well i look forward

436
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,540
to trying it out at some point yeah why not try it out you got it um especially if you have game

437
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,580
pass you just are going to have all those games already ready to try out so why not um i have not

438
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:45,500
tried it on my phone yet it is supposed to work in safari or um uh google chrome or whatever

439
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,860
depending on what what you got uh it but i just haven't tried it on my phone yet um let's see

440
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,180
uh jason and chad says 80 gigs ha call of duty has already eclipsed 200 call of duty was not

441
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,580
one of the games um grant that no i don't think grant that on five was in the cloud

442
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,460
no uh i don't i don't think so i thought i saw streaming yeah um paitlin hanumea says i got two

443
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,860
platinums in no man's sky one for playstation 4 and when i installed it on playstation 5 it gave

444
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,340
me a second yeah a lot of people are having that interesting over that flight simulator on there

445
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,140
no which surprise or at least i don't remember seeing it i don't want to definitively say that

446
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,500
i didn't notice it um i mean that would be worth it because that downloads probably yes it's a huge

447
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,820
download but i also think see flight simulator is one of those where i'm like i think it's better

448
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,900
if you download it because the 4k visuals are stunning and until they can uh get the cloud

449
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:48,140
gaming at 4k uh i think i think it's it's worth the download but that's me um yyr in chat says

450
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:53,260
omg rob you are a genius i've been downloading extra games just to finish those damn weekly class

451
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:59,740
quests launching them via xcloud is so much smarter thank you ego inflate thank you ego

452
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:06,380
plus plus you inflated rob's ego it's super effective thanks why we are good luck uh and

453
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:13,580
bobby says i think exactly um bobby blackwolf says i think flight simulator is coming later

454
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,340
because they're still upgrading x cloud xbox series x right now it's all on xbox one oh that's

455
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,980
a i forgot about that thank you oh i'm very curious to see what happens get the old fight

456
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:30,060
simulator then like the emulate that old ass one from like the pcs in 1988 we'll do flight

457
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,660
simulator one how about that i think that can that can work right i think i saw a skin in the store

458
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,900
where you could do or maybe that's just for the little computer on the plane i don't remember but

459
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:47,660
a flight sim and run flight sim in flight sims yeah that sounds fun why not i think the the

460
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,500
crazy thing about flight simulator the some of the shit in the store is why would i ever buy this

461
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:59,420
there's things where it's like download the improved uh airport in whatever city in germany

462
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:07,580
for fifteen dollars what i'm gonna say fifteen dollars on fucking airport dlc like i have to be

463
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,580
super serious about my flight sim to spend that kind of money i'm sure there's someone out there

464
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:18,300
that drops it hey you spent your money on whatever you want but for me i was like what the fuck that

465
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:25,820
is way too much money for something like that s2100 matt says zaku would get that dlc i don't

466
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,380
even i i need the man to speak for himself i don't even know zaku would get that dlc that's

467
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:37,820
like some of the planes for a couple extra bucks i get that an airport for that much money no

468
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,740
anyway that was my experience with xcloud i'm looking forward to seeing how it continues

469
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,500
can't wait to stream from my own xbox because apparently that will be a thing that's coming

470
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:54,780
in the future very exciting um and uh i i will say dead by daylight was a game i almost tested

471
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,660
um but i was kind of like if i'm gonna play dead by daylight on my pc why wouldn't i just play the

472
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,340
steam steam version that i already have on here but it is there all right well you know why i'm

473
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,660
playing on what i am because the steam one yeah yeah but um yeah yeah if they ever i really hope

474
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,060
they get that cross play working across more platforms that would be lovely we'll see all

475
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:21,100
right we're gonna get back into some more news and uh we'll start it off with oh i guess i should do

476
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:26,620
some quick housekeeping um right now as actually no i'm i'm confident saying this so there will

477
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:33,900
not be a show in one two three four weeks uh labor day weekend there will not be a show i will not be

478
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,500
here um right now my agenda has me going to dragon con i'm hearing rumors and rumblings that could be

479
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:45,740
uh maybe not a thing even if they do not end up having dragon con i'm still taking a vacation

480
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,060
um i've been working way too hard over the past year and a half i deserve a vacation i'm taking

481
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:56,540
a vacation uh i don't really want to live in the space of negativity so i'm not gonna list out my

482
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:01,340
different options of what i'm going to do if there isn't a con but i'm thinking about it and there's

483
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,500
lots of ideas right now so we will see but there will not be an olr that week because i'm not going

484
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:12,780
to be here uh one way or the other so that's that um all right otherwise let's move on we have so

485
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,380
but if there if there is a dragon con and you feel up to coming i i get it's a weird year let

486
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,460
me know if you're gonna be there i have a lot of panels be great to see you all right let's move

487
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,700
on we got a lot of news uh in fact we have this story um again this week but some important

488
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:35,420
developments on the activision blizzard front loki start us off yeah so blizzard president

489
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:44,940
j alan brack is stepping down um good no basically uh you know he was one of the two people that were

490
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:52,460
mentioned by name in the um allegations in the first place so it makes sense that he would do

491
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:59,100
that since you know there's probably going to be some uh stuff coming out about that so he is

492
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:08,860
stepping down he's being replaced by um jen o'neill and mike gabara and then also apparently along

493
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:14,620
with you know all of this kind of all these statements from the company that we're hearing

494
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:21,660
about how you know oh yeah we're addressing the you know the issues and stuff like that but

495
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,060
coming from the actual employees themselves and not leadership we're hearing that it's actually

496
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,620
not really happening the way that leadership is saying basically saying that um you know

497
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:42,380
there's no no no comment on paid transparency you ignore our calls to end mandatory arbitration you

498
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,540
didn't commit to adopting inclusive recruitment and hiring practices um so all these solutions

499
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,420
basically that you proposed you're not really addressing any of them or any of the solutions

500
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,660
that they propose so it doesn't sound like change is going to be coming anytime soon

501
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:04,460
um so we'll just have to see how this all plays out well for what it's worth and i i i want to

502
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,060
just start off by saying i completely agree and support that the employee demands need to be

503
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:15,980
listened to and they need to be responded to and that needs to happen however i think the first

504
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:23,660
thing that had to happen for any of this to happen is j alan brock had to go so the first the this

505
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,340
this was the first step it's a step but it's not the finish this not the finish of the last

506
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,180
of the story um we all know he had to go he knew he had to go i guess i don't they don't really

507
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:41,500
say if he opted into it or they they uh it doesn't really fucking matter honestly he's gone um and

508
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:48,140
that was the important first step um i think the selections of this the i guess successor temporary

509
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:56,060
successors is interesting uh mostly because uh mike was with xbox and i know we got a lot of

510
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:02,780
pr stuff from him out of xbox a lot of quotes because i i always would joke because mike deft

511
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,300
has a very very similar name and so i would always laugh like you know oh act deft at the time you're

512
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:15,820
in the news again you know talking about xbox um so it's i i the we know that he has a familiarity

513
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:22,620
certainly with the um pr stuff uh jen she come i think that is very interesting because she comes

514
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:31,180
from vicarious visions who blizzard just acquired not that long ago so that is very much a sign of

515
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:36,140
we're willing to take this culture in a different direction because she hasn't been a part of

516
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,820
blizzard's culture as long but i again i think that's a good thing um and obviously vicarious

517
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:47,500
visions have been doing a lot of things right um so i think i think it's interesting um i don't

518
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,500
i don't know if ultimately it will be one of them or maybe another outside party ends up coming in

519
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,620
to lead a ceo or what but i think it's an interesting um partnership so that's that's for

520
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:06,860
sure um sj100 matt chat says the svp of hr also left this week which also needed to happen yes

521
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:14,220
i'd heard about that as well uh yes considering hr all of this happened under hr's watch

522
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:23,100
absolutely that individual had to go as well so see you later um who's next uh what what

523
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,500
was her name we brought up last week fran town said i'm hoping i got that name oh she needs to

524
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:36,540
go she's i heard she resigned from that council so like i i don't know that's not resigning from

525
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,980
the company which i think is what we would like to see but we're seeing movement we're seeing

526
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:47,900
movement yeah oh thank you quest buster thank you francis towns and also stepped down from the abk

527
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,300
women's network but she's still in her executive position for now so we'll see what happens um in

528
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:01,420
the coming coming days she just needs to absolutely go i didn't know that either sj100 matt says she

529
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:10,460
deactivated her twitter too well she made some good less garbage on twitter ah so yeah um i i'm

530
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,620
really glad though we are talking about you know we're still kind of putting and i think for those

531
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:19,020
that um want to support what's happening and i think it's it's very interesting that i think

532
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:25,500
a lot of people have realized that like a boycott isn't really the path maybe for i mean at the end

533
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,700
of the day you need to do what's comfortable for you and if a boycott's what's comfortable for you

534
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,020
that's fine but i think there's a lot of people that realize there's a lot of great people at

535
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:39,180
abk that want to continue to support the you know those people the majority of the people who are

536
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:46,380
really great people um and uh i think the best thing we can all do is continue to uplift these

537
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:53,660
voices our retweets our reminders that hey just because j alan brack took the fall for a lot of

538
00:51:53,660 --> 00:52:00,380
this stuff doesn't mean that it's over because this poison was uh in a lot of places in the

539
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,380
culture and so a lot of these other things have to change so that this doesn't happen again we

540
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,500
have to continue to uplift that message need to pump their stomach and get rid of all the bile

541
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:20,540
yes absolutely so uh yeah um i suppose we'll see what happens in the coming weeks i

542
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,620
again don't think this is the last we're going to hear this this is three weeks in a row now

543
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,620
and i i think this is a story we're going to hear about honestly every week until at least

544
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:34,940
the end of the year so we'll see where this continues to go um anything else on that loki

545
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,700
did we get everything well i was gonna say you know it's good that we're talking about it with

546
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,460
you know activision and stuff but i would hope that we'd also not forget that ubisoft is also

547
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,420
covering up for these types of people as well so i need to put the pressure on everybody

548
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,180
and hey in the ea just because we're not talking about you right now don't think that you're out

549
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:00,780
of this either because i i'm willing to bet this culture is everywhere we have not forgotten 100

550
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,260
fair call out this culture is everywhere within the tech industry and i know i've said this before

551
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,660
on the show and i'll say it again every company should be evaluating these sorts of things right

552
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,860
now especially in the tech industry you know this this should be the wake-up call every company

553
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:21,500
needs to find this poison within its culture and as dark sakura said initiate emergency procedures

554
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:28,060
to get rid of the bile pump the stomach pump the stomach so yeah mike deft is saying riot

555
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:35,180
so many companies in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network absolutely so um yeah and a great

556
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:41,020
call out loki this is ubisoft is not off the hook just because the spotlight's on abk right now

557
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,260
and i think with a lot of these call outs and things you know especially if you if if we don't

558
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,340
see the management really deliver on these promises i think it's going to get us closer

559
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,580
and closer to where we all have thought the employees of the industry have needed to be

560
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,260
for a long time now which is a union or at least and like i said in last week's show

561
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:08,620
a legal support group is kind of like the first step in that capacity so all right anyhow let's

562
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:14,060
yeah sj100 matt says yeah i'm still surprised eve's at uh ease come on ubisoft still has a job

563
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:20,860
yeah me too i'll quite honestly so and bonds 006 says music industry film industry media all of

564
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,860
them absolutely but you know what the music industry and the film industry have at least

565
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:33,580
unions yeah there's that so anyway since loki brought up ea let's talk about ea but it's

566
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,420
completely different type of topic we're going to talk about boring financial reports but um

567
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,820
kind of something interesting because a lot of companies have been reporting financial results

568
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:47,260
this week and ea is certainly one of them as well um so obviously what we just talked about has not

569
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,540
been in the news for ea so hopefully internally they are looking at it um it certainly did not

570
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,700
come up on their earnings call at least to my knowledge uh if they said a quick sentence or

571
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,740
two about it it did not cross my radar but what they did talk about i know of was uh their

572
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:07,500
financial year and and and how things are holding up there so ceo andrew wilson of ea and the report

573
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,580
said it was a strong start to the fiscal year with our incredible teams delivering experiences

574
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:16,220
that continue to bring hundreds of millions of players together uh our expanding ea sports

575
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:23,420
portfolio uh apex legends battlefield 2042 and our leading live services were set to deliver

576
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:29,180
more great games and contents to players this year um what i think is interesting is when the cfo

577
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:36,860
blake yorgensen uh started to talk a little bit about f1 2021 which was codemasters first release

578
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,660
under ea because you know ea bought codemasters not that long ago so we had kind of the first

579
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:47,660
release it's and this is a quote from the cfo it's to the testament of an exceptional game

580
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,020
development team that was able to produce the right assets to produce the right marketing

581
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,580
materials to help us drive this business and the team's working together and you know what i think

582
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:00,860
we don't get enough credit for that ea is a bunch of people who really can work well together and

583
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:05,900
we do a great job of working with other parts of our company and when we bring in acquisitions we

584
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,100
work well with them i think the poster child is respawn and you look at what's happened with apex

585
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,500
legends this is a team effort and respawn has obviously driven the amazing development of apex

586
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,660
but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now it's coming up to almost

587
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:24,140
2 billion in business over two years that's unheard of in our industry and i'm not sure

588
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:30,140
we get enough credit for it well ea there's a reason why you don't often get credit for

589
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:41,980
acquisitions if i may pandemic visceral games maxis software westwood studios black box games

590
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:48,220
play fish mythic entertainment bullfrog what do all those studios have in common

591
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:58,460
ea bought and closed them so that is why ea you don't get a lot of credit when it comes to the

592
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,460
acquisitions and things like that in fact people are kind of wary of you when it comes to that

593
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,220
that is going to be a trust that's going to take you a long time to earn back congratulations on

594
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,820
the success of apex though respawn really did do a great job yes yeah clap hello let's celebrate

595
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:18,780
that yes apex is a great game what did ea do to do for that okay i guess they they put money to

596
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:25,020
advertise it a little bit more and maybe you know invest in a little bit fine you get you get you

597
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:31,340
get a gold piece of um glitter that is that's that's the new award here when you did something

598
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:37,260
so minuscule fine we'll acknowledge it congrats ea you get the gold piece of glitter for your success

599
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,220
you you did the bare minimum huzzah

600
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:48,300
thank you for doing what was expected of you but you know who gets the gold star

601
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:54,140
respawn studios sure you can have a gold star too dark but but respawn really gets the credit there

602
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,100
because again you know look at the stuff that ea still owns and i you know even if i want to be

603
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,340
you know i would say a smart ass but i'm really just speaking the truth when it comes to those

604
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,820
closed studios i would even say look at ea's partnership with clump companies like bioware

605
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:15,500
um i don't think that's been a great partnership no it hasn't massive Andromeda thinks that has

606
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:29,180
not been a great partnership in my opinion anyway it's it's been it's been how very uh bonds 006 and

607
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:36,540
chat says when i hear or cea i expect loot boxes yeah but i mean i guess that's part of where some

608
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,380
of their but essentially they didn't name star wars and any of that stuff in their financials

609
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,380
but i guess that's because it's only related to the news you know in the past few months

610
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,500
and what's really done well for them which of course you would expect you know with the

611
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:55,020
f1 2021 and so forth uh apex of course is ongoing sure they're gonna um have some announcements of

612
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,580
the things to say there but i just thought that uh that whole thing about you know we should be

613
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,500
celebrated more for what we're doing with acquisitions it's kind of like why don't you

614
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,220
why don't you pull over a little bit here on some of that those comments you know why don't you why

615
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:13,980
don't you give some of these studios the space they need such as bioware to really make uh

616
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:20,540
good games when they go on sale day one bug-free experiences then we'll say you're being a good

617
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:28,060
partner oh also it's not my job to pat you on the back for doing a job you know what i'm giving you

618
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,620
no credit for anything the only credit i'm giving you for is all the terrible things in this

619
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:38,540
industry that's what you can get credited for ea interesting because one of the worst companies in

620
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,940
the industry bobby blackwolf and chat says and that's where perception is everything ea games

621
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,500
for the past few years haven't had loot boxes yet nobody cares i thought fever still had them

622
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,460
because oh no no no no they they still do they still totally do they have the whole ultimate

623
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:58,540
team stuff which is loot boxes so yeah they they have had them they just haven't had them in some

624
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:05,660
games like uh like star wars and um trying to think some of the other ones that they had but

625
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:11,100
yeah they know the the thing is they make so much money from fifa ultimate team that they don't need

626
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,140
to put like loot boxes and everything they still have it in madden um and there's lots of things

627
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,540
that they kind of fifa just kind of pay for the rest of the company like pretty much at this

628
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:25,740
point like it's just really like if it wasn't profitable for the company i mean you wouldn't

629
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:31,020
have people farming this stuff in giant server warehouse you know with all these playstation

630
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,620
fours and stuff like that we just had that last week or the week before i remember that yeah

631
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:41,660
people thought it was bitcoin so like i mean obviously it's incredibly profitable for them

632
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:46,140
so like i'm sorry no you're not a little indie studio we're not going to pat you on the back

633
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:51,420
because you did a good job and like honestly like this last formula one game was probably developed

634
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:57,580
before he even acquired codemasters so you get no credit for that i'm sorry like just you get

635
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:04,780
nothing you lose good day sir uh stirlock in chat says fifa ultimate team is so bad there's a

636
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:10,060
literal black market no i'm not joking yeah the uh the playstation farm we just alluded to a

637
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:16,060
little bit ago uh as shown under matt says you get a participation award ea to pin on your fridge

638
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,220
now take your jukebox it goes even farther back to that remember when they your account got hacked

639
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:26,060
because of uh and got stolen and people bought you know fifa ultimate team stuff do i it it's

640
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:30,140
been it's been years yes i understand that but like this thing has been going on for a long

641
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:35,500
time like and these these are the guys that wanted you know online passes and stuff like that for

642
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,620
used games like ea is just an evil company i'm sorry i'm not going to ever forgive you for any

643
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:46,860
of this stuff you're an evil company and you're always going to be an evil company period you

644
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,780
know what though i'd rather these type of evils than the other evils that have been in the news

645
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:58,220
hate to say it but obviously in a perfect world you know what it's just different shades of the

646
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:06,140
rainbow okay of evil that's the rainbow of evil all right let's move on i had an x that i would

647
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:11,340
call the rainbow of evil but we won't go there all right let's move on and the rainbow of evil

648
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,020
dark soccer it's who i think it is you know which of course you know which which x it is

649
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,900
yeah all right moving on that was a choice i don't want to talk about it moving on

650
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:32,460
uh next story dark saga well something that probably comes as a surprise to nobody and has

651
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:40,460
less to do with uh companies actually being terrible is uh the intellivision amico the

652
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,780
the console that a lot of people have been like super excited mitigated about

653
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:53,500
well it's been delayed again um it was originally supposed to come out in october 2020

654
01:02:53,500 --> 01:03:00,300
and then it got pushed back to april 2021 and then fall 2021 and now uh this email went out

655
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:07,420
to those who pre-ordered and it said that it was delayed further with the pre-orders due to arrive

656
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:14,860
at the end of 2021 um i got that email yeah because you had yours pre-ordered i sure do

657
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:21,260
yeah it says uh and i'll just read a little bit of the content the team at intellivision has been

658
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:26,140
working tirelessly to bring amico our family focused entertainment system to eager households

659
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:32,060
around the world we've grown to a strong and stable company of more than 60 passionate team

660
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,620
members spanning three continents representing some of the industry's best talent all of us

661
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:43,980
are extremely excited to share amico with you and going on uh in spite of all these hurdles

662
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,860
hampering our ability to fill to fill all orders we are focused and determined to deliver pre-ordered

663
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,340
units by the end of the year this will all also allow us more time to optimize our operating

664
01:03:53,340 --> 01:04:02,700
system for future game development i'm i'm not mad about it so it's it is what it is it is what

665
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:07,020
it is and i'm gonna tell you why i'm not mad about it and i'm not and i because it's not a problem

666
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:12,460
unique to intellivision as a friendly reminder can you walk into target and buy a playstation 5

667
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:19,020
no no it's been almost a fucking year and you still can't walk into target and get playstation

668
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:24,620
5 you can't get an xbox series x either or an s you can't walk into target and buy the fucking

669
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:30,860
console um which is really unheard of in video game history almost a year out so i think that

670
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,980
shows you there's issues there's problems in the supply chain going on nobody can get a fucking

671
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,340
graphics card nobody can get a graphics card without pirating it right now so i'm sorry not

672
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:46,620
pirating getting really lucky yeah or yeah congrats like honestly buy a lotto ticket if

673
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,740
you got a new graphics card because you've got some real luck right now so like you can't look

674
01:04:51,740 --> 01:05:00,220
at this and say like oh this is an intellivision problem no it's an industry problem did intellivision

675
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:05,420
maybe set some of their goals a little bit loftier than they should have perhaps but at the

676
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,580
same time nobody could have predicted what was going to happen in 2020 and is still you know

677
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:15,740
happening as of now so again as much as we we could all dunk on tommy talarico for you know

678
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,660
sometimes the way his ego comes off and all that stuff i just don't think this is the appropriate

679
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:27,900
place to do that this this is just a symptom of a larger industry problem and that's that's what

680
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:35,740
it is period um uh bobby blackwolf says look at a new car lot same chip shortage is affecting them

681
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,140
i didn't even think about that but you're right all the chips that go in uh new cars i'm sure

682
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:46,620
that's pretty uh crazy uh digirama s says rob mid-tier graphic cards are available but they're

683
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:57,180
double retail prices in stores a 1660 super should not cost 379 4 59 retail um quest buster says

684
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:01,420
unless amico has the magic ability to build their own fab plants and supply chains they have the

685
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:06,540
same problems as everyone else yep dr tsuya says exactly everyone loves to kick tommy while he's

686
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:11,420
down but in this instance i don't think they're entirely at fault here no there's other places if

687
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:18,060
you want to dunk on tommy you can do it um i just i think there's other things in this industry that

688
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:24,460
are needing to be dunked on and i think the fact that tommy talarico hypes up his games look we

689
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:29,180
always have those kinds of people in the industry peter molanu was no different than this is no

690
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:35,340
different than this and there's other people hello remember uh no man's sky before and look y'all i

691
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:41,500
fucking stan no man's sky i love that game but was it the game that was hyped up when it came out

692
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,220
we all know the answer to that okay so there are carnival barkers in this industry fine

693
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:51,500
and i and i've said this on the show before and this is you know what i respect tommy talarico

694
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:58,620
i think he's a good guy i am very i met my spouse at video games live for the first time in person

695
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,380
there's a lot i'm personally thankful to tommy talarico for putting together and making happen

696
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,940
i still i can say that and still say but the best business advice i would give them give him is that

697
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:14,860
he should have more visible faces that represent the intellivision amico than just him there needs

698
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:20,220
to be more visible pr faces than just him um and i've said that on the show before and i'm saying

699
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:27,020
it again um because not everybody is buying what tommy's selling and ultimately that's going to be

700
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:33,500
what kicks the system in the butt if they're not careful um yyr says there are some real issues

701
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,780
with amico that go way beyond covet or manufacturing problems if you look at their

702
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,180
recent videos internet posts you see all kinds of red flags in progress videos of games that should

703
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:46,380
have been done ages ago a rocket's office filled with wastes of backers money and of course tommy

704
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:51,180
attacking anyone who dares to criticize them hence why i said there needs to be other pr people that

705
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:56,700
do some of this speaking as far as the other stuff goes well that the time to pay the piper is going

706
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:07,580
to be coming so yeah we'll see all right moving on let's talk about something else that's getting

707
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,900
a lot of hate mail in the industry this week we touched on this towards the end of last week's

708
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:18,940
show but we didn't really dig into it and this story kind of got bigger this week um and so

709
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:25,420
loki why don't you tell us about this yeah so this is it seems like we were also talking about this

710
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,860
like at the beginning of the pandemic as well or like somewhat into the pandemic but you know

711
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:36,780
niantic had removed some of the pokemon go safety measures um despite the fact that we're having

712
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:43,340
different variants of covet 19 popping up now so you know there is still the risk of transmission

713
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:51,340
of these new uh variants as well and so uh back in june apparently they had you know started to

714
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:58,780
roll back some of the double distance tweaks and um some of the other enhancements you know being

715
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:04,060
added to the game despite the fact that you know some people might not want to leave and also other

716
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:10,380
parts of the world are having resurgences um in their area um and because of that you know fans

717
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,020
of the game have been kind of you know trying to let them know hey we don't think this is a good

718
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:21,500
idea and i've even started like a change.org petition that's gotten over 130 000 signatures

719
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:30,140
and basically saying that the ink should extend this um these enhancements that they had in place

720
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:36,780
right now especially also you know there's you know disabled players as well that these

721
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,620
additional enhancements that they had allowed them to actually be able to enjoy the game more

722
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:49,100
um so yeah and then of course with that of course they uh fans were actually saying that

723
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:54,940
they're going to start boycotting the game um because of some of these issues and they're

724
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:03,180
boycott a free game well i mean yeah you you can do that i mean but like if they make money off

725
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:07,900
of people playing the game and buying the in-game purchases so if you boycott the game it does hurt

726
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:15,180
them in the wallet so that's all you can really do um but basically yeah so now you can announce

727
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:21,180
some more legendaries from sword and shield that are going to be coming to port uh pokemon go and

728
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:25,820
uh with those they're going to be part of this ultra unlock thing they have to do these challenges

729
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:34,140
to unlock it between august 20th and september 1st but apparently um they were saying that you know

730
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,700
because of you know some of these issues and stuff folks are just going to be kind of boycotting

731
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:46,300
the game um unless they you know come back to you know extending these features that they had so they

732
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:53,020
were trying to trend uh boycott niantic to show their displeasure with the game and i don't know

733
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,540
i haven't played pokemon go in a long time pack your bags because you're not going to like the

734
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,940
resolution they come up with so the question is going to be how important or shinies to you

735
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:09,900
i i'm i'm trying to be mean or rude but i do think there is a large percentage of people that

736
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:14,140
are signing these petitions and things like that and the number one reason why they're mad and they

737
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:19,580
want things reverted back is that they can no longer hump the pokey stop that was just outside

738
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:24,140
a range of their house anymore for gear all day long or that is absolutely not fair to the

739
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:31,740
disabled community that is but i did not say everybody i said most now the disabled but as

740
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,980
far as the disabled community go i i agree that there are issues there and things that that need

741
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:40,700
to be looked at but these are things that have kind of existed for the first four years of the

742
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:46,940
game as well i think they did a horrible job in communicating i said this last week as well is

743
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,580
that for them to say oh these changes are because of covid and then they say at the time but we're

744
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:55,900
going to keep them for the foreseeable future which implies there's no end date and then to

745
01:11:55,900 --> 01:12:01,100
revoke them when they did and by saying oh well you know now that covid is even though they kind

746
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,780
of didn't phrase it that way but they kind of insinuated because covid is winding down we're

747
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:10,220
gonna you know go put back all these changes that we made and i said this last week and i do agree

748
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:16,780
for with this part niantic did stupid with that like they shouldn't have done that but my honest

749
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:22,860
and i've said this a lot they're gonna put that 80 kilometer or that 80 kilometer that 80 feet

750
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:27,020
thing back you're not gonna like what they're gonna do because i'm i'm telling you right here

751
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:31,580
i know how this ends they're gonna put that in there but they're gonna put a cool down on pokey

752
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,900
stops like more than five minutes they're gonna do something similar to ingress where maybe you

753
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:42,220
can spin it four times and then that's it no more gear for like six hours or 12 hours um because

754
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:47,980
that's the thing that niantic is trying to stop are the people is that that i really truly believe

755
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:51,580
to be the majority of people signing this petition who are just upset that they can't

756
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:56,540
spend their desk portal and and so forth as far as and again i want to stress as far as the

757
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:01,180
disability issues yes i understand those concerns that's legitimate that's a different issue that

758
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:05,740
niantic has to look into that's an issue that's needed to be looked into for the last four years

759
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:15,100
it's nothing new now um let's see uh bonds 006 in chat says i am split on the radius debate of

760
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:22,460
the pokey stops um and that's it's other folks still uh pod culture says who me abuse a pokey

761
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:28,220
stop never look and i'm not saying like those players are doing anything wrong or bad or what

762
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:33,020
have you i'm just it is playing the game yeah they're just i get like and i'm not trying to be

763
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:39,500
mean again i promise i'm just giving you the reality check right um go ahead i was going to

764
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,420
say i've kind of looked at it the same way as the people who complain about no ed and dead by

765
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:51,500
daylight it's in the game it's a function if people use it it's okay it's a function of the

766
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:57,020
game so i don't get mad about it and niantic did botch the messaging on this they absolutely botch

767
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:01,500
the messaging on this and their reply to this community thing which i thought was very impressive

768
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,140
that all the community sites got together and demanded they give a response i thought niantic's

769
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:13,180
response to it was very like yikes but again i just don't think you're gonna like where they end

770
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,540
up on at the end of this um but i was gonna say i don't fault the people that were you know like

771
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,780
pod culture saying i was spinning a stop and all this stuff sure i benefited from it too are you

772
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:26,140
kidding when i would walk around and you know use my bluetooth of course i could hit stops that were

773
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:34,060
even further away but um nobody likes to be given something and then have it taken away

774
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:41,740
nobody likes that that's what this really boils down to um and as far as the whole the other

775
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,380
weird thing to me is this whole well number one the fact that they're introducing zassian and

776
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:52,620
zamzata and all this stuff and the the freaking gen 8 pokemon before they've even finished gen 6

777
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:58,220
have done nothing with gen 7 i mean it's just weird like i i can understand that they could

778
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:03,260
you know you sometimes have regions in pokemon that are a mix of other regions is it like this

779
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:08,700
new um uh uh pokemon legends our arceus game that's coming out is kind of like that where

780
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:13,260
it's like a mix or snap or things like that like but it's like it hasn't been in the pokemon go

781
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:19,100
lore until now so it feels a little weird but i don't i do not think this is some resp like them

782
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:23,820
putting gen 8 in the game suddenly the the some of the gaming media is trying to frame it like oh

783
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:28,380
this is a response to the protest and everything going on is niantic's now trying to sweeten the

784
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:35,020
pot y'all it takes a lot longer to prep the artwork the data and all this like this has

785
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:42,380
been in in the works well before they were making any of these changes so that no i don't no no no

786
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:47,420
i don't buy that and that that part kind of makes me roll my eyes when i see those headlines because

787
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:52,380
i'm like y'all don't understand clearly nobody out there is playing this game that's writing

788
01:15:52,380 --> 01:16:01,100
about it so anyway um so yeah i mean that's that's my take on it take her to leave it um am i gonna

789
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,820
stop playing the game probably not but i mean i just use it as something to kind of like

790
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:11,260
incentivize my walking i don't necessarily need to spend a ton of money on the game i don't think

791
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,580
niantic is really convincing me to spend money on the game outside of you know some of their events

792
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:22,140
are pretty cool um but that's you know that's it um the remote passes i guess are kind of neat too

793
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:27,420
but i'm able to get enough coins for that by doing the gym thing um sg100 matt says they emphasize

794
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,380
that the game is about exploring and walking they use this as justification of the 40 meter spin

795
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,580
radius thing which i get but doesn't the fact that remote rate passes kind of go against that

796
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,460
exploration of walking they're calling for no because it makes money and i i think that's a

797
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:49,340
fair call out is that again why their response was not great and having played niantic games

798
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:55,740
for a very long time and understanding that john hanky comes from a google maps background and that

799
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:59,180
is very much about like being out there and exploring especially with street view and things

800
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:04,140
like that like i get and especially when you look at that they're very if you look at niantic's very

801
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:12,060
first app what was niantic's very first app it was not ingress gotcha a lot of people say oh

802
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:16,540
yeah angry nope it was no it wasn't ingress but i don't remember what it was field tripper

803
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:21,100
was their first down and that was i don't think they supported anymore but that was that was

804
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:27,660
where the very very very original uh ingress uh portals came from was this game about kind of

805
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:33,740
you know starting that idea of these landmarks in your city to go exploring and all of that stuff

806
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:40,140
that's where that came from so like i get that that is niantic's mission and honestly for me

807
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:45,260
it's been very successful i've seen a lot of places i would never have gone to if it wasn't

808
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,980
for things like ingress i'm gonna specifically call out ingress pokemon go just kind of piggybacks

809
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:57,660
on my ingress experience to be quite honest um no that's absolutely accurate yeah so that part of it

810
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:03,580
i get um but i also at the same time can recognize what has to show in her mat is saying you can see

811
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,260
that obvious conflict there and i think that's what a lot of the community is starting to call

812
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:12,940
out is that but if you pay for it you can have this experience and i think you know again there's

813
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:19,900
talk about like poke you stop power ups and stuff like that that maybe could uh yeah um

814
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:25,980
pod culture and chat says field tripper a bunch of bored kids on a bus with tired adults

815
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,700
no no no not that kind of thing uh as joe and her mat says wasn't that where the memes of being

816
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:35,900
let off a cliff came from well i think also i've seen those memes about um the the pissed off

817
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:40,940
pokemon go player base and it's that meme of the the guys just happening with map quest back in

818
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,020
the day well it's the meme of those guys on the pirate ship and they're about to die or something

819
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:50,460
like that and the one says like uh i'm an angry pokemon go player and then it says ingress player

820
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:57,180
first time that whole thing uh because ingress has had its own share of issues over the years for

821
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:03,420
sure but i've never seen the player base quite well we had that transition to prime that a lot

822
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:08,060
of people straight up didn't like and a lot of people left the game as a result of it and i'm of

823
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:14,540
a minority opinion of sorts i think sometimes prime has made ingress better it took i don't

824
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:19,180
know i stopped playing ingress a while ago it didn't help it took a long time to get there

825
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:25,260
but it now it's made ingress better that first year i don't i can see why people were pissed

826
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,140
off absolutely but now ingress prime has made the game better but it just took like what three years

827
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:38,540
to get there so all right anyway let's move on uh oh let's talk about a different nintendo story

828
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,620
i mean technically pokemon go isn't really nintendo it's more of like a license type of thing

829
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:49,260
but let's talk about nintendo sales and nintendo financials so nintendo has published money their

830
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:56,460
most recent quarterly report and uh they have uh made a little less money this year uh in the three

831
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:01,420
months leading up to june 30th they had a operating profit of 119 billion yen that's

832
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:06,860
about 1.1 billion dollars that's a lot of fucking money um however it's not as much fucking money

833
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:15,100
as last year when they made 1.3 billion that's a 17.3 percent drop but i think we all was still

834
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:20,300
animal crossing the other year though exactly exactly i was like we can all see what the what

835
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,660
what what was happening last year that isn't happening as much nearly this year lockdowns

836
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:30,460
and animal crossing it was the perfect storm combination last year that worked out very well

837
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:35,980
for nintendo we don't like to look at companies profiting off the pandemic um but nintendo didn't

838
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:40,140
that was not nintendo's plan we're profiting off people having to be home it's less of the

839
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,700
pandemic you know and they didn't even know that there was going to be a shutdown the same month

840
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,300
they released animal crossing yes and as i was trying to get to that was not nintendo's plan

841
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:52,860
like nintendo didn't play it was just the perfect storm that happened that allowed allowed things

842
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:57,660
to get there um but yes they have not had an animal crossings this year quite frankly

843
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:02,860
i don't think they've really had a big game yet this year now i mean some may argue that oh

844
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:11,180
sure mario tennis and all that stuff yeah no um but when you look at later this year we've got

845
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:16,060
wario ware get it together zelda skyward sword will show up in the next um uh right because that

846
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:21,900
was a july release uh metroid dread is coming mario party superstars pokemon brilliant diamond

847
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,820
shining pearl so i mean there's a lot of good stuff to look forward to from nintendo and i

848
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:31,420
think the financials will be different um but at the same time if you're upset about 1.1 billion

849
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:40,460
dollars um stop that i'm upset about the 1.1 million dollars that no one's giving me right

850
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:48,860
i would take 1.1 dollars right now every little bit i could use a few more dollars than that

851
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:56,300
um yyr in chat says i thought the drop would be way more not because they're doing poorly now but

852
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,500
because they did so well last year yeah like i mean honestly the fact that they only fell 17

853
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:07,420
actually seems pretty good uh sia tabiri in chat says and animal crossing updates yes the game

854
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,460
could still use some of those as well i'm surprised they didn't do dlc i think they're

855
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:15,340
done with that though they did and they did one recently i covered it last week yeah that was that

856
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,780
was a tiny tiny little bump though we we need something major major uh like that mario thing

857
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:25,020
was pretty cool or something like that would be you know nice or the fucking cafe like you said

858
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:30,460
some more buildings from the other um iterations it was data mine that we were supposed to have

859
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:37,980
brewster yeah man if they announced that i would be immediately back into playing um the gyroids

860
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:43,980
i'm surprised was never a thing this is yeah they're kind of morbid though if you actually

861
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:51,340
know where they came from yeah but we don't have to talk about it um stirlock in chat says

862
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:55,100
i really need to get back into animal crossing i think there's a lot of people saying that

863
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,980
but animal crossing at the same time should give us something to come back to

864
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:09,260
right yeah yeah all right let's move on dark sakura well um here's the nintendo franchise

865
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:16,860
that i think uh we can agree is fairly epic and that's going into metroid so they released a

866
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:25,500
trailer um for metroid dread that brings up the chozo um it's it's a pretty short little

867
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:33,580
little trailer it's like you know 34 seconds but it brings up the chozo it you know shows their

868
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:41,500
their sort of hieroglyphics looking uh wall art i don't know what to call it like

869
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:51,580
it's very very egyptian like in nature um and so uh of course in the previous metroid games we

870
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:58,140
always had like a statue or a ghost or something written by one or the chozo

871
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:03,020
uh robot you know that did something on you go to the abandoned ship in super metroid

872
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:12,460
um what people aren't realizing is that there is a whole lot more lore already existing about

873
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:20,620
the chozo and if you look into samus uh into her uh history she was raised by the chozo

874
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:25,180
and actually had some of their dna bonded to her so that she could live on their planet

875
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:34,540
and so i'm actually hoping that we get a lot more throwback to uh her time with chozo you know

876
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:40,380
a lot more of her history with growing up among the chozo and where they all went and what happened

877
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:46,860
to them because you know they also made the metroids and where did that get them i'm really

878
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:52,140
looking forward to it i've always had fascination with the chozo in that series and you know me when

879
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:59,980
i get into a game i really get into the lore so i'm really excited about it and of course um

880
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:05,420
it'll be out october 8th for switch and we'll find out our answers there i reckon

881
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,980
yeah i mean samus is a pretty unique character you might say she's the chozo one

882
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:18,460
are you looking at how i'm staring at you right now no i'm not you should be i will be

883
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:25,100
episode from the archive so that pun dies tonight this is me staring at you in judgment

884
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:33,420
just carrying on the tradition of the 23rd maggots that's all all right you are a dad i guess

885
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:38,220
somebody has to bring the dad jokes to this show all right check out they call them dad jokes

886
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:45,580
because they don't want to call them bad jokes hi i did one too now that actually was pretty funny

887
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:56,380
all right moving on come on dad what's the next story yeah dad well uh let's talk about

888
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:05,020
duke nukem again um so apparently uh the embracer group has bought seven different studios including

889
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:12,460
3d realms so they had purchased um basically some of the publishers uh like uh gearbox

890
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:20,860
thq nordic and deep silver uh but now they've bought three realms ghost ship games um what else

891
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:32,300
uh forcefield easy trigger uh dixie uh dixie art and crazy labs so a lot of those i don't recognize

892
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:40,220
but i mean i definitely recognize 3d realms so don't know what that means necessarily in

893
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:47,340
the terms of new games i guess we'll have to wait and see i would like to see a keep well making if

894
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,620
they keep making duke nukem games at the um regular rate we'll find out in about 2030

895
01:26:54,780 --> 01:27:02,140
yes well there was like um there was a a new 3d like fps game that was done in the

896
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:09,980
build engine so you know definitely the same technology as uh duke nukem 3d but you know

897
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:14,540
pretty awesome polished game they had a lot of stuff with that that retro throwback game yeah

898
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:19,820
yeah yeah yeah so they have some of those i like to see more of those coming along i mean duke nukem

899
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:28,380
he's a hard character to kind of bring into this modern age of 2021 i mean just not necessarily

900
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:36,540
a character i could see a lot of folks liking nowadays um but i don't know more games like that

901
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,700
that would be fine i guess like actually now that i think of it you know there's some games

902
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:47,180
that came from the build era that are still kind of doing well so maybe who knows what was that

903
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:52,860
game forever was not good what was that retro that game now it's gonna bug me it it uh it had a like

904
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:58,540
a disagreement with a metal band it was very similar to um some metal band there was that one

905
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:02,140
but there's been there's been actually a few other ones oh i don't remember that was the one i was

906
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:07,660
thinking of yeah i know which one you're i don't remember the name but yeah i it's there was a

907
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:12,060
couple other ones that were also using the build engine that looked pretty awesome there's one i

908
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,700
just saw recently it's using the doom engine like the original doom engine but it's like it doesn't

909
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:22,460
look like it's running doom anymore i mean they've done so many tweaks to it but there's a lot of

910
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:27,340
these games i like that where they kind of take this old technology and really enhance it to with

911
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:33,340
the modern visuals but it's still you know the old school engines which is kind of cool

912
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:40,860
or just a mod just a really good mod which you know is a really good mod the the um you know

913
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:45,420
xbox and playstation and all those versions of the game like officially support mods now

914
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:51,260
thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you iron maiden but they changed the name to ion fury

915
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:55,980
yeah i knew it was some metal iron maiden yeah exactly iron maiden had an issue with it and

916
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:02,060
yeah so now it's ion fury yes thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you all right you get more

917
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:09,660
than just the glitter for doing that research for me all right let's move on let's talk about a game

918
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:14,540
that for some people gets a gold star for some people not so much it's pokemon unite which

919
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:19,660
i actually i played a little bit more of that this week but um i don't know i like playing the game

920
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:24,300
by myself isn't as fun like if i can hop on there with friends and stuff it's a little more fun

921
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,060
because we have something to talk about but playing with randos gets kind of old to me but

922
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:32,460
i i still as far as mopas go it still is probably one of my favorite ones i'll check it out when

923
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:37,500
it's on mobile phones as well i want to see how it plays on the phone um comparatively but pokemon

924
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:43,740
unite just got a big update so um there is a new update that really went in there and uh changed

925
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:47,260
some balance and maybe that's why i'm pissed because eldegoss kind of got hit with the nerf

926
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:53,500
bat and she can't heal as much as she did before um although i guess her uh special attack move

927
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:58,700
uh can do more so i don't know i guess there's a trade-off there but um like pretty much all the

928
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:02,860
other pokemon got some type of changes i i'd list them all off but it was just about everybody

929
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:07,580
uh so that here earlier this week and i believe it's also bringing a spectate mode to the game

930
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:11,500
although they did not enable that at first um i can't remember if that's in there now or if that's

931
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:17,980
still coming um but uh next month there is plans for the mobile release and there will be cross

932
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:23,020
platform play between of course the switch and smartphones um and if you log into your nintendo

933
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:28,220
account or your ptc that's pokemon trainer club account you can cross save data in progress which

934
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:32,620
would probably be a good idea i'm just curious how moving around is going to work on the mobile

935
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,940
phones but i guess if you just tapped on the screen where you want to go it might work out

936
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:41,500
um so interesting mike defton chat says i'm playing it right now well i hope you're i hope

937
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,260
you're doing well i hope you're winning who's your main mike deft that's what i want to know

938
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:49,420
because i was i will say the one thing i did do this week i i'm like an eldegoss main right i

939
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:54,940
played like 98 of my matches with eldegoss i bought snorlax and try to match with snorlax

940
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:00,060
because i i like snorlax as a pokemon and uh i thought the moves would be fun oh boy did i get

941
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:06,540
beat oh boy did i get beat i guess i need more practice okay nine tails i was looking at i was

942
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,860
looking at that's because it's a lowland nine tails slash volpix right i was looking at that

943
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:16,300
one because i like the whole like freeze mechanics and stuff um maybe i'll check that one out next

944
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:21,820
all right anyhow it's uh time for our next segment here at orange launch

945
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:26,140
radio which uh i would say needs no introduction but we actually have a special introduction

946
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:43,740
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

947
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:48,700
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week

948
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:57,100
but as we know in a 2021 twist once a month we get a flag that means fucking weird arcade game

949
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:02,940
and i believe that's what dark soccer has picked for us tonight right oh believe me we get the flag

950
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:08,940
so basically the game that i chose and on its own it doesn't necessarily seem like it should

951
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,220
be a flag until you actually see it played the game is final furlong which i have brought up

952
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:21,580
many many a time as the horsey humpin game it is a horse racing game developed by namco it came out

953
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:31,100
in arcades in 1997 um it is one of the only two games that run the namco system 22.5 gorgon

954
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:39,660
hardware which is a early revision of the namco system 23 hardware so basically in this game you

955
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:44,780
have three checks to choose from six and a half furlongs a one mile and a one and a half a mile

956
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:50,860
you have different horse classifications you have like a leader a front runner a mid runner

957
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:55,660
a strong finisher and two quote almighty runners who like to keep their position

958
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:02,060
you sit on a saddle as it were and you have this

959
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:10,780
i this thing it doesn't really look like a horse it's got like well it kind of kind of does but um

960
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:17,660
i've seen the ones where they don't exactly like look exactly it's just so weird they're just weird

961
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:24,460
okay they kind of look like horses but you have this bar you hold on to and the thing is is that

962
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:29,820
if you fit on it then you're supposed to ride it like it's a horse and you know move with it

963
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:35,020
and everything but i've seen people who are way too tall for this thing who just stand up and

964
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:43,820
push at it and people look like they're humping the horse just just what it's just it's fucked up

965
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:48,860
um we had one i don't know if they still have it because i haven't been there in ages but

966
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:54,780
roseville golf land had one no they had one i remember they had one at uh country club lanes

967
01:33:54,780 --> 01:34:00,380
for a while um but that's gone unfortunately roseville golf land had one that's tucked over

968
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,780
like along the same wall as the entrance that's where i remembered it being and then they replaced

969
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:12,220
it with derby's owner club long gone yeah it's been a while it's been a while years um and uh

970
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:20,140
uh basically though it did get a rating as one of the best games overall with the quote from

971
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:25,020
gerald lynch for tech radar saying the machine was brutal popping you a straight a giant plastic

972
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,300
horse you'd propel yourself forward by getting up your steed rocking maniacally forward and

973
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,660
backwards to speed the beast up best played with two players the marathon like events would last

974
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:41,740
so long you wouldn't be able to walk for a week um yeah that's what they say about humping sometimes

975
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:50,540
too just saying um at any rate there actually was a sequel to final for long um and that was

976
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:59,900
final for long too aptly named one we had actually yeah i'm pretty sure that that was it um and it

977
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:10,620
had like some more options it came out in 1999 um and it also was uh i want to say it also ran on

978
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:17,980
no it ran on system 23 it ran on system 23 so it did use the upgraded system um both of these

979
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:24,540
though i do believe could link up to four players playing so it was kind of neat it was just i mean

980
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:31,020
the thing that that again classifies this as swag for me is just how how it looks when you play it

981
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:39,660
yeah they look like less of them riding it more of them choking the horse violently yeah yeah

982
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:42,380
they're they're they're doing the hump with the horse but

983
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:48,060
they're they're getting their fictitious catherine the great on

984
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:58,140
but yeah that's that's the game final furlong all right there it is let me give my earbuds back in

985
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:04,060
there classic flag of the month final furlong and um i'm sorry i ran to the restroom so you

986
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:08,300
guys probably brought this up but we had that one locally at a country club right yes i also

987
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:12,700
brought out the one that they had at rvgl as well i don't remember i don't remember that one

988
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:20,860
and i had one for a hot minute fun all right yeah and honestly uh derby owners club was a much

989
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:26,140
better horsey game i'll be honest it was but but but not quite as much fun to watch as this one

990
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:33,340
i've injured myself on final furlong i wonder where all those derby owners club games have gone

991
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:39,100
i think the one from what i understand the one at rvgl is still there but i also haven't been

992
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:45,100
there in like two years no it's not i i'm pretty i want one the last time i was there which was

993
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:52,220
back in 2020 i'm pretty sure it was not there anymore i i usually walk around because if it

994
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:56,940
was there i would totally be playing it so i'm gonna kick dan's mustang out of the garage and

995
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:05,500
get a derby derby owners club kidding that's worthy really nice um i swear the last time i

996
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:10,140
was at a dave and busters i think the one of the great mall they still had this set up for it but

997
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:15,180
granted that was a few years ago at this point so i haven't checked on it lately that's a dnb

998
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:22,540
that has gone kind of downhill ever since they got rid of the uh battle tech thing oh yeah i

999
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:27,100
forgot that was battle tech in the day too now it made me nauseous as all hell but the battle tech

1000
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:31,500
pods were really fun well yeah those are the ones that bobby's talked a lot about those on his show

1001
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:37,340
because they still they still bring them to dragon con every year i used to play that back in was

1002
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:44,940
that they had it was i never was called now in the downtown plaza in sacramento it was like a

1003
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:54,060
bunch of uh bars fuck that's america live america live that is a throwback locally here that place

1004
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:57,820
that is that is now an arena well yeah yeah

1005
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:04,780
pod culture brings up the star wars pod it's kind of not the same thing though because you're not as

1006
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:13,900
immersed yeah this is like um it's very you know the battle tech had a very complicated system

1007
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:19,980
yeah but it was cool uh yyr says uh pretty sure all the dave and busters got rid of derby owners

1008
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:25,100
club by now well that's unfortunate but at the same time it probably wasn't bringing in the money

1009
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:29,580
and they probably wanted to put in you know i don't know whatever stupid machines make money

1010
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:35,420
i just remember the names we would name our our horses oh yeah all the silly names who come up

1011
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:41,500
because i still have a bunch of my cards um i haven't um been to a dave and busters a long

1012
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:45,820
time ever since round one was a thing i don't think i've been to a dave and busters since

1013
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:53,660
round one kind of started being a thing i went to dave and busters about a it had to have been like

1014
01:38:53,660 --> 01:39:01,180
in january or so because i met up uh last year because i met up with jd and we went to the one

1015
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:08,780
that's like way out closer to daily city oh yeah yeah way out there okay the ceremony yeah yeah

1016
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:13,420
yeah because that's where it was already at and so that's where alan lived when we first

1017
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:20,300
started dating was that area this was quite a quite a commute yeah yeah um uh i was gonna say

1018
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:25,020
that round one here locally in roseville still not open as far as i know unless it just happened in

1019
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:30,140
the past couple weeks but i don't think so and uh that's it's weird because round ones have been

1020
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:33,820
open i've been to the one in concord since the pandemic i was there just recently a few weeks

1021
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:38,140
ago before the the delta variant kicked up and all that stuff but still it's still like i'd

1022
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:42,220
they're not shutting businesses down again they're saying get vaccinated and wear a mask

1023
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:49,420
and you know most businesses are staying open um so uh um i've been around one recently so

1024
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,940
it's weird that the one in roseville still isn't open but i guess maybe they really just want to

1025
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:59,180
wait out the the quote-unquote worst of the pandemic behind they're just behind on getting

1026
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:05,100
it done because there's also the movie theater that's supposed to go above it or blow it yeah

1027
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,860
another industry that got hurt through all this pretty yeah it was like a

1028
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:11,660
cinema or something like that so it's

1029
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:19,260
yeah i i i look every time i'm at the mall and it's it's never open i'm like oh i wonder if some

1030
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:22,940
of these movie theaters are waiting for that um was it a warner brothers deal or that whole like

1031
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:27,660
hbo max thing they'd only promised that through 2021 so i wonder if some of these are waiting for

1032
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:33,740
that to be done before they open theaters new theaters again you know because i guess the whole

1033
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:38,860
like a simulcast deal has been hurting some of the box office intake ask ask garland johanson

1034
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:48,460
what she thinks of that and that whole thing so yeah yeah all right anyhow uh let's go ahead and

1035
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:52,940
travel around and check out some rapid fire news and quickly check out some other things going on

1036
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:58,700
in the industry we'll start with loki so curveball space program has officially announced that they're

1037
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:04,380
ceasing um development on the first game which i guess makes sense because they're putting out

1038
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:09,340
curveball space program too so it would have had to have stopped at some point but keep in mind

1039
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:14,540
though they've been developing the game for 10 years so a long time you know i i think that

1040
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:21,260
they're allowed to do that the last update uh was just released on august 3rd um and that was

1041
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:30,540
the one point 112.2 update which fixed over 90 bugs in the game so yeah i guess it's fine that

1042
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:36,140
they've stopped development on that since they got to move on at some point um and apparently

1043
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:42,060
pac-man 99 has been doing well uh despite the fact that it's not you know the the mario game

1044
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:48,380
and that has surpassed four million downloads on the nintendo switch um i attribute that to

1045
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:53,500
the lack of things that they're putting out as part of that nintendo online since we're not

1046
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:58,540
getting a lot of new games but you know hey people like their battle royale games and that's kind of

1047
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:05,100
cool um is this going to be a temporary game as well because like i don't know they haven't really

1048
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:09,100
said i don't know i don't think they undated it i don't think i just want still around right tetris

1049
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,420
one's still around and uh it was just that mario one for whatever reason they put an expiration

1050
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:21,900
date on it that's so stupid i don't get it it's just dumb um all right uh is dark soccer there

1051
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:26,220
as she turned off her cam so she might yeah she might have gone afk for a second so um i'll do

1052
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:31,740
a quick aside before we get to her story since she brought up pac-man um uh alan was just at costco

1053
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:36,620
like just now today like before the show and he said you're laughing because you know where this

1054
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:41,020
is going right were you know where this is going no i haven't been in costco but i already there's

1055
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:46,780
only one possible outcome because i could just be so he sent me this picture on our chat app that we

1056
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:55,660
use um oftentimes um that he saw at costco for i'm sorry i'm looking at the price here 369

1057
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:01,740
he found this i'm holding up my phone like you guys can see it he found this arcade one up machine

1058
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:09,500
that is super pac-man now i gotta say i love the fact that it's branded super pac-man because a

1059
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:14,540
lot of times these things are reskinned as oh hey alan funny you should walk in here this

1060
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:18,540
i'm talking about what you saw at costco here do you want to do you want to are you camera

1061
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:22,780
safe do you want to talk about no he showed he didn't want to come on and talk about it

1062
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:28,300
but he sent me a picture of it and he was like you know kind of not word for word but was kind

1063
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:33,820
of like you know you want it type of thing basically and i here here was my response my

1064
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:39,340
response says the minute we put the money down to buy that cabinet that's when the

1065
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:46,060
tron pre-orders are going to go up and we're going to be pissed so i i actually said no

1066
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:51,660
you saw that they finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game right yes i did see they

1067
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:57,340
finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game i don't know why they waited so long but like i

1068
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:02,140
don't either yeah um so the here's the thing and then we'll get back i see dark soccer's back so

1069
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:06,460
we'll get to her rapid fire stories as soon as i wrap up the story um the on the arcade one-up

1070
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:11,820
machine uh with the super pac-man i did again i love that it's super pac-man branding which maybe

1071
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:20,700
jamie wants to hear this i don't know uh sure at costco a 369 super pac-man branded arcade one-up

1072
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:28,460
with super pac-man pac-man pac-mania galaga galaxian dig dug and pac-land so it's seven games

1073
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:33,580
and those are like honestly i love me some super pac-man i like pac-mania i like pac-land i love

1074
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:42,140
dig dug so that's a pretty solid cabinet the only problem is if i i there's another cabinet they put

1075
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:48,300
out not recently that's not excuse me a little bit recently that's not at costco and it's the namco

1076
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:55,820
legacy machine and that machine has all of the same games but it's 4 49 it's it's almost like

1077
01:44:55,820 --> 01:45:04,300
80 more than costco but it's pac-man pac-land pac-man plus super pac-man pac and pal pac-mania

1078
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:14,220
galaxian galaga dig dug dig dug two mapi which is huge and rompers are in that machine so yeah i'm

1079
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:19,020
like oh the dig dug two even though that wasn't quite as good as the original uh because it's

1080
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:25,100
very different and um the uh mapi really make that cabinet but i love the fact that this one is is

1081
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:29,900
branded super pac-man now to answer the question in chat where somebody said why not somebody

1082
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:38,300
said why not both uh w04 said porque no los dos um the tron cabinet and the super pac-man eventually

1083
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:43,900
um some things are in the works that i haven't talked about yet um but i will very soon i promise

1084
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:50,380
and we'll be able to have a little more um space around where we live to have some more cabinets

1085
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:57,580
because we're making some changes um but right now i could i could squeeze in one more

1086
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:04,380
but you know again like i said the minute i buy the super pac-man cabinet that tron cabinet's

1087
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:09,260
gonna come out and then i'll be pissed because i won't have any space for the tron cabinet

1088
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:14,780
so bobby blackwolf in chat says wait for tron that's the plan because here's my thought tron

1089
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:18,700
could end up being a limited thing like maybe the burger time thing was and i don't know if

1090
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:23,820
i'll be able to get it forever pac-man you're gonna be able to get pac-man forever and it's

1091
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:28,300
not even so much pac-man as it is super pac-man for me but those games are always going to go

1092
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:33,340
hand in hand if there's a pac-man cabinet it's gonna have pac-man ms pac-man pack of

1093
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:40,940
pac-land it's gonna have the various pac-man games in it for sure so i will wait all right

1094
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:46,540
anyhow i won't wait any more to get some more rapid fire news dark sakura now that song is in

1095
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:51,900
my head i can't wait my new shoes oh i thought you were gonna the dawson's creek song no

1096
01:46:52,860 --> 01:47:00,860
um first of all no second of all i hate that song and third of all no and number four i hate that

1097
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:11,580
show so getting into some actually interesting stuff um there uh there's another mario game

1098
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:17,580
that has come out and sold for a shitload of money there is an unopened copy of super mario

1099
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:28,220
brothers again that um sold for 2 million um that topped the 1.56 million uh for a super mario 64

1100
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:38,140
this particular one by the wata scale is a 9.8 a plus rating which means it is in exceptional

1101
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:49,260
condition and cool i just i just don't understand what you know i i get that this is a very specific

1102
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,100
pressing of the game so even if you have like a super mario brothers cartridge lying around

1103
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:58,540
chances are this is not the two unless you again are extremely lucky and have you know lottery luck

1104
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:02,620
it's not the one that's going for 2 million in fact these things going for 2 million have the

1105
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:09,260
box instructions unopened but it's that very specific like sears tab top to the box it was

1106
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:19,740
sold for a very limited time only at sears so silly all right and then um now space invader's

1107
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:26,220
invincible collection is going to be on switch but it's gonna cost 60 bucks on august 17th

1108
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:33,340
too much uh huh i said too much money yeah that's pretty much what i'm going with um

1109
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:41,580
tito announced the collection um it is available for pre-order um but that that's quite a bit um

1110
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:51,820
it has 11 different versions of space invaders from the original 1978 uh to uh 2018 space

1111
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:59,100
invaders giga max 4se and has a free download of the 2017 mobile release arcanoid versus space

1112
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:10,060
invaders um but i mean it is kind of niche you know yeah i'm with sterlock who says that's one

1113
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:14,860
expensive tab the good news is these types of games tend to go on sale pretty quick so wait

1114
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:19,500
for like you know around the black friday time of year and i bet you this comes way down in prize

1115
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:29,020
yeah but i mean i i won't be spending it for that i mean if i was gonna get getting a physical copy

1116
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:37,020
maybe yeah but no i think this is interesting the stuff that yyr is talking about is still talking

1117
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,460
about that mario sale but i think this is interesting why we are in regards to the mario

1118
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:45,100
cartridge sale says this is basically just one company trying to drive up the prices i wouldn't

1119
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:50,460
be shocked if they sold it to themselves nothing about these last few weeks record-breaking mario

1120
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:55,580
game sales is legit it did seem to come out of nowhere didn't it when i've always been led to

1121
01:49:55,580 --> 01:50:00,940
believe that stadium events is supposed to be like that must have nes game where did this freaking

1122
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:06,780
like super mario brothers original box like 2 million cover i think stadium events was what

1123
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:12,140
like maybe 700 000 last time we talked it's just it's just we it is weird that this is all all of

1124
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:18,780
a sudden in it all right maybe i'm getting too much conspiracy theory but i think i think it

1125
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:23,660
just the timing is strange somebody else has suggested it's like pandemic driven

1126
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:29,500
collectible mania or something but i don't it's just weird all right what's not weird some new

1146
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:56,620
the week i hate to keep going back to this but you y'all are falling down the rabbit hole in

1147
01:52:56,620 --> 01:53:02,140
chat and i love it um sha100 matt again about the collectible thing says there is a backlog with

1148
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:07,500
collectible appraisals services where you ship your collectible for it to be graded due to the

1149
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:12,860
pandemic because of that prices have shot up on things and see i would never really thought of

1150
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:17,100
that but i didn't even realize that was the thing you could do but who would make who would mail in

1151
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:23,420
a two million two million dollar video game but i guess i guess it's possible but i can't i get

1152
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:27,500
but i also understand like that is like something that's driving everything up even if not this

1153
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:33,740
particular piece of merchandise went through that process so um fascinating i guess i need to watch

1154
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:38,940
more antiques road show because i have no idea how all this works when it comes to collectibles

1155
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:44,220
so who knows what i have a lot of shit in my house and who knows if any of it's worth anything

1156
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:51,900
maybe that's why i hang on to it all right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we

1157
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:55,900
get to the listener round table you may or may not have heard we are taking calls again so

1158
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:00,540
we'll check in on the green green room a little closer to the um listener round table in a little

1159
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:07,500
bit uh for now uh loki yeah so apparently we're hearing some more rumors about that

1160
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:13,740
new playstation vr2 and this is coming from a leak from a sony developer conference and

1161
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:20,700
apparently the leaker has been known to um have some reliable information so we'll go with that

1162
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:26,460
and um you know some of the things we've kind of already heard about before you know with

1163
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:31,660
you know the different uh you know field of view so like you know it's supposed to have

1164
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:36,860
110 degree field of view uh 10 it says up from 10 degrees from what it was before

1165
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:46,060
uh the resolution of 2000 by 2040 pixels per eye and apparently it's a little bit

1166
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:52,940
that is a little bit better than say the oculus quest 2 and then um you know of course there's

1167
01:54:52,940 --> 01:55:00,060
going to be you know a oled display on there and um you know of course better lighting you know

1168
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:04,540
color with that i want to hear more about the actual controllers but i don't think there's

1169
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:12,140
anything in there about that um but yeah so lots more um a little bit more information

1170
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:17,180
kind of piggybacking on some of the earlier rumors that we heard before but there's this

1171
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:25,900
whole video out now uh by this uh p psvr without parole um a youtuber that has uh some of the

1172
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:31,100
details about that so i don't know sounds interesting i'm excited they when they finally

1173
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,780
announce all the information and kind of how that's gonna work with especially backwards

1174
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:40,300
compatibility and stuff like that and whether there's a new you know uh until dawn rush from

1175
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:47,500
blood or rush of blood game because that's really gonna sell it for me um but yeah next year i guess

1176
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:52,380
we'll just have to wait until all those leaks come out hopefully you can walk into target and

1177
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:57,100
get a fucking playstation 5 oh yeah yeah gonna have to have a playstation 5 to run that on too

1178
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:02,540
i guess that's kind of important so um they can't figure out those chip shortages this vr is going

1179
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:10,460
to meet the same fate so this is true yes but um yeah and i'm sure i'll use it so much more than my

1180
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:18,700
current vr headset which has been in the box for a year or two i don't so i don't know well it just

1181
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:24,220
depends it just depends if the games are there that's the most important thing so yeah all right

1182
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:28,700
well one game i don't think we'll end up on psvr too because i think this is more of a microsoft

1183
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:35,580
thing is pubg but did you guys hear the name of pubg has officially changed this week the new

1184
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:40,860
acronym is pubgbg because the new game the new name of the game is pubg battlegrounds

1185
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:47,100
now atm machine yes it is like atm machine okay because think about let's let's think about what

1186
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:53,340
pubg meant player unknown battlegrounds so the name of the game is player unknown battlegrounds

1187
01:56:53,340 --> 01:57:01,420
battlegrounds that is yeah it's a game where that's like saying fight against each other

1188
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:07,420
and and it's that's like saying atm machine yes exactly i just said that

1189
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:17,100
i missed it so yes uh pubg battlegrounds here's why they're doing it so they want to expand the

1190
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:24,300
pubg brand through new experiences set in the universe so calling pubg battlegrounds that is

1191
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,380
going to be representative of the battleground game but there is a new game coming out called

1192
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:36,380
pubg new state it's a mobile title with a futuristic setting uh it is uh um i guess the

1193
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:40,460
creators of dead space made a game called the callisto protocol which is connected to this

1194
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:44,620
oh yeah i remember seeing the trailer for that at one of the just call it the player unknown

1195
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:47,100
universe or something like that like i mean pubg

1196
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:57,020
i don't know the only way that they can really do this now is really lean into that like we need to

1197
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:03,340
get you know you need to get someone saying yo dog i hear you like battlegrounds so we put

1198
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:07,260
battlegrounds in your battlegrounds so you can battlegrounds why your battlegrounds you know

1199
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:12,060
they need to really lean into that now uh bobby blackwolf also points out part of it is that

1200
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:15,820
player unknown has left the industry so they don't really want to use his name anymore so

1201
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:22,620
pubg has just kind of become a i guess you know perhaps you should have renamed your game a long

1202
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:26,860
time ago well wait i have okay i have a great idea here because i was going to say here's

1203
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:30,460
some even more exciting now if you want actually something to actually be excited about when it

1204
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:36,620
comes to pubg bg here it is there's an official collaboration coming between pubg battlegrounds

1205
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:43,660
and blackpink the korean pop band cool so yes uh you could it's a black there's a blackpink

1206
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:47,500
collaboration bundle there's like a new parachute and there's some other stuff as well so in my

1207
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:52,700
opinion why don't we just make this game blackpink battlegrounds because now there there's an

1208
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:59,340
unproblematic fave that we can all be excited about uh owning the franchise so that's my bp

1209
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:10,220
bp bg bp bg bg the future of gaming although is it you know what when it comes to the whole like

1210
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:15,260
we want to create a universe and other experiences you know think back to the start of the show

1211
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:20,540
and you know we all remember a day when it was pubg versus fortnight uh and you know look at

1212
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:24,620
what we just we spent i can't believe we talked for 15 minutes at the top of the show if not more

1213
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:28,620
about fortnight but we sure did because it deserved it it did something that kind of

1214
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:33,180
necessitated the discussion um and you know what if pubg is going to be mixing it up with

1215
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:37,660
different types of events and stuff i mean i don't think blackpink is doing a concert

1216
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:42,380
i think this is just some some branded you know costumes and stuff for the store but

1217
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:52,620
i for i for one welcome our bpg bg bg game um yyr in chat says blackpink versus ariana grande

1218
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:57,180
we can only hope that is the only way we can solve the fortnite pink worked with cardi b

1219
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:03,260
that's and a few other american artists yes and you know what let's let's not pit the

1220
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:08,060
women against each other let's let's let's just let's let's be fans of all the games

1221
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:12,460
how about that all right how about women uplifting women right that's right that's right

1222
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:19,340
all right uh w u w bg bg all right let's move on dark sakura

1223
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:32,460
so um oh i lost my place for a moment anyway uh our type final three has been announced

1224
02:00:33,580 --> 02:00:40,220
and it's a free update to our type final two like are they just like do they call them final the way

1225
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:45,580
that graphic designers call their projects final or share it's never final or final

1226
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:50,380
we all know that shara's had so much surgery she's practically immortal

1227
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:59,660
um either that or she's just gonna have uh um chad michaels fill in for her for the rest of

1228
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:09,180
her shows why not but anyway um granzella the developer is uh putting out the the update um

1229
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:16,620
there's on the kickstarters page for uh uh our type final two um they're saying that there's

1230
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:23,100
going to get be more dlc more ships um and over the rest of the summer there's going to be some

1231
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:28,700
improvements to the pc version and finally by the end of the year our type final three

1232
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:37,020
it'll be a free upgrade for those who already own our type final two and uh that it's only japanese

1233
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:45,420
only but there will be english subtitles later on so uh yeah at least they can count to three

1234
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:51,420
valve uh orange right in chat says i played through our type final two good game

1235
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:55,740
well now you'll have final three to play through as well exciting i love our type

1236
02:01:55,740 --> 02:02:02,700
but nothing is ever the first level music for the first our type um the hits keep coming in chat in

1237
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:10,860
regards to the pub gb g story uh yyr in chat says you're listening to olr radio okay let's have a

1238
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:17,580
chat do not refer to this show ever as olr radio um i don't want to speak for dark sakura but i

1239
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:21,260
have a pretty good feeling that if you do call this show olr radio if you look in the mirror

1240
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:26,300
and say olr radio three times dark sakura will reach out to the email and slap you silly so

1241
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:29,100
don't do that am i right it will happen

1242
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:39,900
um and then bobby blackwolf says rob roberts hey watch it so i hate to bring things down

1243
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:46,940
but but i just found out that an actress i really like died oh the marquee post story yeah i love

1244
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:53,660
night court okay no night court was great that is sad i had no idea she was um in in bad health but

1245
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:58,540
i guess she had been battling cancer for a little bit because um yeah she was still acting for quite

1246
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:04,620
some time she was uh the mom and something about mary yeah yeah so and she didn't she'd done other

1247
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:09,340
stuff here and there so yeah i actually saw john larroquette's post about it i don't mean to bring

1248
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:14,140
things down but oh my goodness no it's fine well it's also sad that like like we've lost several

1249
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:18,780
people from night court just in the past few years it feels like harry anderson died in 2018

1250
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:25,260
and charlie robinson died uh this year as well yeah yeah i i was like i thought we just lost

1251
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:30,540
somebody else from that show not that long ago so anyway that's all right sometimes sometimes i

1252
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:34,460
have a night court marathon sometimes the news breaks during the show i mean even though that

1253
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:37,820
technically was overnight but that's right sometimes we don't find out about them until

1254
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:43,660
we just hit that right tweet yeah all right um loki i feel like we alluded to this already in

1255
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:50,220
the show but uh why don't you make it official yeah so apparently grand theft auto 5 is leaving

1256
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:59,340
xbox game pass um you know it's not been on there for very long uh but yes there's gonna be some

1257
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:07,020
other um games coming as well though um so like this at least the early part of this month we've

1258
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:13,340
got a you know katamari democracy reroll as you mentioned uh skate and skate 3 were put on there

1259
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:21,900
as well uh this week art of rally and of course hades and then the stuff leaving um aside from

1260
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:31,820
grand theft auto we have uh dark siders genesis final fantasy 7 and uh don't starve and train

1261
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:38,540
sim world 2020 so yeah a lot of games leaving but there's been they've gotten a lot of like

1262
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:42,860
i just said like luminous and uh katamari were added recently so let's be honest if

1263
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:47,580
you haven't played grand theft auto 5 in the 10 years it's been out i mean like true

1264
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:54,540
true okay it's not even i played a little bit of five finally it hasn't been out for 10 years

1265
02:04:54,540 --> 02:05:01,020
but it's been out close almost it's a long time it's almost eligible for classic game of the week

1266
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:05,420
it is almost eligible for classic game of the week and we don't even have grand theft auto 6

1267
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:13,660
yet so what is going on all right sorry games well um a game that absolutely should be and by

1268
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:18,060
the way if you want to call into olr we're almost to that point of the show so um headed to the

1269
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:22,300
green room if you want to call into olr i see somebody in the public chat but i'm not sure if

1270
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:25,500
that is just left over because that was the same person that called in a bobby show so i'm not sure

1271
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:29,100
if that's where they just kind of ended up after the show but head over to the green room if you

1272
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:36,620
want to be in be in tonight's olr um while i get while we wait for that uh heading to this story

1273
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:39,740
which now this is a classic game i'm almost positive this had to have been the classic

1274
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:45,660
game of the week at some point if not dark cycle we need to remedy that at some point but um this

1275
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:49,420
game is absolutely something that's worthy of a classic and one that i wish would come back and

1276
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:55,500
i'm talking about marvel versus capcom 2 uh is a game that a lot of fans this week have just like

1277
02:05:55,500 --> 02:06:02,540
it seems like it's a very viral thing on twitter oh it has been now uh episode 789 according to

1278
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:08,540
our wiki whenever that was wow i'm not gonna say it's because of our show but i mean i did have it

1279
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:12,300
as my background video a couple weeks ago so i just you know want to take full credit for that

1280
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:17,900
and and everybody look at tonight's look gonna take you for a ride look at tonight's episode

1281
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:26,780
number 879 and dark soccer just said this was the classic game on 789 is that a coincidence

1282
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:35,740
there are no coincidences anyway marvel versus capcom was 388 well for some reason the credit

1283
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:42,060
for this particular uh recent charge to get this game re-released is a content creator maximilian

1284
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:48,220
dude um i i don't know the name myself but they must be more popular than us um they began a

1285
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:54,620
hashtag campaign called free mbc2 which apparently got a lot more steam than president kat did

1286
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:58,300
but um sorry one sec guys i just had an earpiece fall out

1287
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:08,220
okay that was extremely graceful all right um so this style he's grace

1288
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:13,180
he'll drop his earbuds in your face again and i'm just sitting here lamenting how are there

1289
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:18,300
all these people more popular than us while i'm a big klutz we'll have on air all right

1290
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:24,060
uh there's a free mbc2 hashtag to try to get support among folks who want to see this crossover

1291
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:30,780
head out now this these types of uh uh campaigns happen once in a while what makes this notable

1292
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:35,180
a similar thing to what made the president cat thing notable back in the day and that is the

1293
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:39,740
developer responded remember that remember when the developer responded to us during the president

1294
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:43,900
cat thing and i'm sure they were like what the fuck but that's not what they said i'm not a

1295
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:49,820
famous capcom responding so that's fine yes uh so in this case the studio head of digital eclipse

1296
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:56,780
mike mika actually said on twitter we made what i think was the last mbc2 release on console when

1297
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:04,620
we were known as backbone um let's see uh 16 by 9 and so forth i love the outpouring we'd swap

1298
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:10,860
in ggpo and do documentary and museum work we'd need to talk to disney and capcom to make it real

1299
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:16,860
we're game if they are hashtag free mbc2 and oh yeah disney is a player now because disney owns

1300
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:24,060
marvel so that would be very interesting um so yeah um and of course folks note that digital

1301
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:28,220
eclipse has worked a lot with this type of stuff they did the street fighter 30th anniversary

1302
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:32,780
collection they also did they also have worked with disney the disney afternoon collection

1303
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:41,180
and so forth um there was a playstation 3 and xbox 360 port of marvel vs capcom 2

1304
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:46,300
and that was pulled from online stores in 2013 because of the license that expired for the

1305
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:52,380
comic book characters so um yeah it'll be interesting to see if this can actually happen

1306
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:58,940
though i would love that i could i can stand behind this that's for sure but some folks are

1307
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:02,860
saying you know again we don't you know if you could re-release it we don't have to shell out

1308
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:08,300
a hundred dollars for a copy you know that was on the dreamcast or whatever or pirate it which

1309
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:14,860
is what a lot of people are doing i think at this point so interesting uh dr tsuya says ggpo is the

1310
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:20,220
online thing i believe some of capcom's older re-releases use it like i think dnd did yeah

1311
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:24,780
they're probably talking about updating some of that online stuff so yeah i would i would love

1312
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:29,180
that uh and quest buster filling me in because i'm very uncool and i don't know all the content

1313
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:33,820
creators telling me that maximillian dude is a massive fighting game aficionado and he breaks

1314
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:38,140
down info to make it appealing to people that may have never played a fighting game before all right

1315
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:44,940
well prop props to him he this this crossed our desk so um and you know obviously we don't catch

1316
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:53,180
everything so um congrats that's great uh dj rama s says i prefer capcom versus snk 2 over marvel

1317
02:09:53,180 --> 02:10:00,140
versus capcom 2 to which i say why not both everyone's entitled to a wrong opinion why not

1318
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:07,580
both let's have both in one release i think that would be great all right anyway i just i you know

1319
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:11,980
i don't even get you know talk about talking on fighting games to a level of people that don't

1320
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:17,260
usually get into fighting games i don't get into fighting games a lot but that is one that i love

1321
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:22,540
and i would instantly buy if it was re-released and you know not buggy or things like that so

1322
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:28,460
that's that's for sure uh some folks in chat uh bobby blackwell says tatsunoko versus capcom

1323
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:35,420
well that'd be pretty cool um and dj rama s says rival schools hell yeah to that now we need

1324
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:42,380
shooting to justice die got going as in the college years all right we're gonna go to the

1325
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:48,140
listener round table and we're gonna take some calls here on orange lounge radio uh we just

1326
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:51,980
recently brought this feature back and so it's still a little bit of an experiment in progress

1327
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:56,300
but if you want to give us a call head on over to the green room keep in mind i could pull you

1328
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:01,500
in here at any time so just be ready for that that's the one thing uh i've lost from before

1329
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,420
is the ability for people to hear when i've picked up the line and then acknowledge them they can't

1330
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:09,660
hear that anymore they're just boop they're on air so we'll see how that goes and we're gonna take

1331
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:15,740
this call right now and see how it goes um hello you are on orange launch radio who's this

1332
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,140
hey there's that hey act f it is great to see you how are you

1333
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:29,180
i'm doing pretty good um i just like some some of the things uh we're probably gonna talk about

1334
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:36,220
but yeah i'm thinking what's on your mind tonight um well basically i do want to talk about uh the

1335
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:40,540
niantic and pokemon go pull out all right have a great week we'll see you next time no i'm just

1336
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:45,660
kidding what what is your you you love pokemon go you play it a lot what's your take on this

1337
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:55,740
whole thing uh yeah basically as you'll probably know i i do like a lot of what is pokemon and

1338
02:11:55,740 --> 02:12:03,180
especially pokemon go i talk about it oh probably probably for every week uh if you see me on

1339
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:09,820
twitter i post a lot about it uh either getting chinese getting like perfect id

1340
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:14,460
pokemon playing go battle league me ugly begging you to join a remote raid

1341
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:24,220
sometimes yeah or open gifts stuff like that but yeah uh but basically i just want to

1342
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:32,780
add a little bit to at least a little bit little bit more of context to what's happening right now

1343
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:39,580
yeah well yeah and obviously you all take all talked about uh the covid bonuses and all that

1344
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:46,780
uh and especially the distance thing which it is it actually it is actually really useful

1345
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:51,740
and like dark sakura mentioned uh too it's it helps a lot of disabled people

1346
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:58,220
uh i i personally know some of the uh in the community that actually benefited but because

1347
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:03,820
of that because they are disabled or they don't they don't have like easy access to some of the

1348
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:11,180
polka stops so it actually helps them and at the end of the day it helps us all but aside that

1349
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:18,220
aside that it's pretty much in you've already said it it's the handling of all the things it's like

1350
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:26,380
yeah they responded they said they're they're they're listening or they're hearing us but at

1351
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:34,940
the same time the next day when the part uh part two of the ultra unlock starts and right now you

1352
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:43,260
can get a heracross from from raids it's just a regional it's a regional that it's all available

1353
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:49,980
in some places of florida and most of latin america not where i live because i live to way

1354
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:55,660
to up north of mexico but but still it's like okay it should be available in the wild it should

1355
02:13:55,660 --> 02:14:02,620
be uh for those who live in those regions it should be accessible for them and what did

1356
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:09,340
diane take went and do they took out the wild spawn of heracross they took out they took it

1357
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:15,180
out pretty much of out of the game and the only way you can get anywhere what is a heracross

1358
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:22,220
it's only through raids you only get one one raid per day one at least one free pass

1359
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:30,380
per day and you have to go to the gym uh so for anyone that oh yeah i live in central mexico i

1360
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:37,260
live in south america whatever oh i can uh a lot of people were excited they're excited because

1361
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:46,460
oh we're gonna we're gonna get a regional shine and niantic doing that and especially after what

1362
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:54,220
they did the day before is what is driven most people like really really out of the game and

1363
02:14:54,220 --> 02:15:03,020
the point of all this is communication if niantic where to communicate better what their what their

1364
02:15:03,020 --> 02:15:10,780
plans are if they actually like consider what the community wants and likes about the game

1365
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:19,500
we wouldn't have these problems it's like and and and i was one to defend niantic in the past and

1366
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:27,500
and there's evidence of that too i'm not gonna i'm gonna like hide it but it got to the point

1367
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:36,380
and especially this week that um that niantic is pretty much like at least they're showing us that

1368
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:41,820
they don't care they don't care about us they don't care about the player base the only they

1369
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:48,620
are they are only caring about getting the map you know in in my case yeah i'm gonna play the

1370
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:54,780
game because like i said the game is about the community the game is about us that we made the

1371
02:15:54,860 --> 02:16:05,020
game basically but i'm not gonna spend any money on it like i don't no no no remote passes no

1372
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:12,700
premium passes no incense nothing that is gonna come from my pocket if i get if i get like poke

1373
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:19,180
coins that stuff it's gonna come from the gyms if i remember to do so you know but i was just

1374
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:22,380
saying sorry but i'm glad you brought up the hair cross thing because you're right i'd forgotten

1375
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:25,580
about that and part of that is probably just because i'm spoiled because i don't live in that

1376
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:30,540
area where the hair across usually spawned so i forgot that this was the thing now if i remember

1377
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:35,740
right niantic and again i and and let me finish my thought here because uh i i do think niantic

1378
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:40,860
made a boo-boo on this but if i remember right there was a tech issue where if they had kept

1379
02:16:40,860 --> 02:16:45,500
niantic uh or if they kept hair across in the wild it would have that same shiny rate that

1380
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:50,620
was increased for the gyms so i think they increase it to like one in 64 in the gyms ends

1381
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:54,460
up being a shiny and if they did that in the wild it would put too many of the shiny hair

1382
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:58,940
crosses or whatever in the wild and so i think they're going to put it back after the gyms are

1383
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:03,660
done but it would be at that normal shiny rate of like one in 512 or something like that now

1384
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:09,900
that all being said and i've explained the the system limitation uh there's a very common line

1385
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:14,700
we've started to use on this show a lot in fact it's not maybe the golden rule of gaming where

1386
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:19,180
a system is only as good as the games that are on it but maybe it's the the silver rule of gaming

1387
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:25,100
culture and that is it's not the facts it's what's perceived and the fact is if the tech

1388
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:30,060
system is broken niantic and the tech system is preventing you from having the thing in spawn in

1389
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:35,260
raids at the same time it's in the then fix the fucking tech that's the problem because what's

1390
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:42,540
being perceived by folks like mike deft and many people around is is just that you're being shit

1391
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:48,460
greedy is is what's happening and so the tech side of that badly needs to be fixed quite

1392
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:54,140
honestly um can i tell you a weird anecdote though and it honestly has nothing to do with

1393
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:59,900
this but it was weird to me so you know that before all this covid shit started i was i was

1394
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:05,340
in that part of the world right i went to miami to take a cruise to some of the caribbean which is in

1395
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:11,180
that same you know uh a latitude area that like the parts of mexico where hair across spawns in

1396
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:18,540
is and i caught lots of regionals i caught corsola i caught the um cactus thing that is

1397
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:24,060
in that area in florida as well maractus yeah well maractus was the big one because that's

1398
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:29,420
that was the one that when i brought back like all the big pokemon players were in this area were

1399
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:33,900
like can i please trade you for a miraculous because that's the one you couldn't get anywhere

1400
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:39,020
else um and then uh and they're all gone now that's the one pokemon like all of them went

1401
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:44,380
that i caught anyway carne vine that's the one i was trying to think of that part of the world

1402
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:49,340
so i got all this i didn't catch a single hair across that entire time just a weird a weird

1403
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:54,140
antidote that has nothing to do with this but it so when i was hearing about this i was like well

1404
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:58,220
hair across didn't fucking spawn anyway like because i was like i didn't catch them when i

1405
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:03,980
was down there but apparently that is very much just like apparently they spawn everywhere and

1406
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:08,460
it might just depend on the time like maybe i just was there at a weird time the only way i had a

1407
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:13,580
hair across was from our pal jd because he was playing pokemon go at the time and he went to

1408
02:19:13,580 --> 02:19:17,500
florida on a family trip and he caught one and traded it to me so i had a hair across before

1409
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:22,700
this but now i'm like well i want a pink one but yeah of course i'm not i'm not affected by the

1410
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:30,700
whole um it but but another pokemon that spawns in raid right now is kangaskhan right and i'm

1411
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:35,500
hearing that australia which is the new zealand which is the region or no does new zealand have

1412
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:41,180
or they have just relicanth right they they i i think they have kangaskhan on new zealand too

1413
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:48,380
and obviously australia it's like the oceania oceania but either way i'm hearing that they did

1414
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:55,500
not pull the kangaskhan wild spawns in australia so that is just again just a weird fucking

1415
02:19:55,500 --> 02:20:01,820
perception too like okay but the kangaskhan are just gonna be everywhere in shiny but the hair

1416
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:09,420
across can't so i i mean i get it i get why people are like dude you guys suck and and that's not

1417
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:15,740
not only that there's precedent of them unlocking regional shinies before and keep it done in the

1418
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:25,180
wild so it's like it's it's not necessarily that they need to boost or they they want to keep it

1419
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:33,180
like fair quote-unquote for everyone it's no it's it's like there's nothing that should

1420
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:41,900
uh prevent them or like stop them to to release in the wild because again there's

1421
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:49,740
already a precedent we already have like taro's as you said kangaskhan barfetch and mr mine which

1422
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:56,140
are regionals uh on someplace of the world and when those were really shiny though they were

1423
02:20:56,140 --> 02:21:01,900
still spawning on the wild i i actually remember getting a wild taurus during that event in

1424
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:08,300
particular and getting the shiny because it wasn't the wild it was not only in eggs it was in the

1425
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:15,820
wild and it was i think full on it's what it was for once so even like something like hair across

1426
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:20,380
and i i understand what you're saying it's like understandable but at the same time

1427
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:27,340
they didn't that before they didn't do that before yeah so doing this right now it's like baffling

1428
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:33,500
and so many people are actually angry they're they're not putting anything in the game some

1429
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:39,100
up some many have happened too well but again it yeah it's i was just to say it is it is

1430
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:45,820
interesting sometimes to see where the player base will break and say you know what and i'm

1431
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:50,940
talking in mass where the player brace bait breaks off and says you know what fuck this i'm out

1432
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:57,020
because another game i'm thinking of that recently had this happen is world of warcraft and this is

1433
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:01,580
this was happening before any of the activision blizzard stuff for the past few weeks so let's

1434
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:07,580
try try to now as i'm saying this not that that is not part of that it is now for some people

1435
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:12,220
certainly but at the time people were still breaking off of world of warcraft in mass and it

1436
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:16,940
it seemed like it just seemed like the weirdest to from me who broke off world of warcraft eight

1437
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:21,980
years ago i was like now you're leaving world of warcraft like because they did something with

1438
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:27,980
sylvanas that was like i'm like the it's the story of the last few expansions has been pretty mad

1439
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:34,860
this is just weird that like now you're leaving okay but um now it's like with pokemon go it's

1440
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:41,180
like hair across that's the thing that sets you off okay interesting but i'm just i'm i don't i

1441
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:45,740
don't mean that in a negative or condescending way it's just it's interesting to me what sets

1442
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:52,140
off the player base in mass sometimes i think uh not only the hair across thing but it's like

1443
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:59,740
the snowball getting bigger and bigger and again coming this coming after niantics like

1444
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:08,140
like like really really bad response i i don't want to go way further into my words but it was

1445
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:14,940
a really bad response and even i and when when they put out the response they posted it i was

1446
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:20,540
at least they responded they did something better than nothing but after seeing the hair across thing

1447
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:29,420
is like yeah i cannot justify them anymore it's like i'm done with them but again it's like

1448
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:37,100
and and i was talking earlier this on my own um gff cast uh that i do not feel the like the

1449
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:43,500
tinesing fallacy or whatever it's called because i have so many good memories of the game and

1450
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:50,140
i have met so many awesome people through pokemon go it's like i have i have found so many communities

1451
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:55,580
even like in on twitch it's like there's so many good stuff i have from the game that i have

1452
02:23:56,140 --> 02:24:01,740
uh gotten from it it doesn't necessarily in the game so yeah i was i'll still play pokemon go

1453
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:09,260
i'll do like again go battle league i'll do raids whenever i can when when i do have like free

1454
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:17,020
passes all that stuff but again i'm i'm not like really in the mood to put any money into it like

1455
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:24,060
like uh sj 100 mad saying like uh the the community days the one dollar thing it's like

1456
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:30,300
yeah i'm not gonna buy that i always buy it even if it sucks but now it's like i'm not gonna buy it

1457
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:38,460
at all yeah so yeah it's like um and it's so it's like it's like it's a really easy fix it's not

1458
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:43,980
they're not necessarily talking about the game it's like gigantic just communicating to us like

1459
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:48,460
being a little bit more transparent if they're like expect and again that's returning to the

1460
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:55,020
heracross thing if they had said oh heracross is only gonna appear in raids at least we would know

1461
02:24:55,020 --> 02:25:02,060
it's like okay we we understand okay it's whatever we'll wait if if we want if we are in the region

1462
02:25:02,060 --> 02:25:09,020
and all that stuff but like being so secretive for something like that it's like no no this

1463
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:14,060
that's not how we play let me ask this question before we wrap it all up because um we're gonna

1464
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:19,180
play the hypothetical world where um and i love this hypothetical world because the hypothetical

1465
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:24,540
world where rob is right so let's play in this hypothetical world where rob is right that uh

1466
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:30,860
what i said ends up happening the the 80 meters comes back but you're gonna burn out pokey stops

1467
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:35,420
after four spins for a four hour period i don't know something like that so let's say they kind

1468
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:41,980
of do like a halfway type of uh thing is that gonna bring you back into the fold or have we

1469
02:25:42,060 --> 02:25:43,740
gone past the point of no return at this point

1470
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:55,740
it's like even if they actually do a radius thing like like even like if you say it's like it's

1471
02:25:55,740 --> 02:26:01,020
going to be done like oh a burnout after first things like they do in english it's like it's

1472
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:07,100
the same on english if they do that the same as ingress it's like okay it's a compromise

1473
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:13,980
but we i still need to see more from them it's like we still have so many problems in the game

1474
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:23,020
uh and and like again go battle league the lag the the bugs all that stuff it's like still present

1475
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:31,820
in the game yeah uh so many many stuff in terms of uh of cash grabbing like the raids like the eggs

1476
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:42,620
there's so many things that need to be addressed at least that until they do that i will i will

1477
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:49,260
invest in the game of fair but until then yeah that's that's like no go even if they do that

1478
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:55,740
it's like no we have to at least keep a little bit of pressure into address at least them addressing

1479
02:26:55,740 --> 02:27:00,540
all that you know what's really interesting and i i totally forgot to bring this up during my gaming

1480
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:05,340
week but i'll bring it up now on wednesday night i actually went to an ingress meetup and it was

1481
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:09,580
an official ingress meetup because you know there's a whole kind of separate team and group

1482
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:13,740
that's working on that and maybe you've even heard of this uh deafness some of it's probably you know

1483
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:17,580
crosses over and some stuff like oh well look what they're doing over on this side they have

1484
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:22,860
that whole van tour or the xm detection van which is the whole thing of the ingress lore so they

1485
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:26,940
have this van traveling around right now it was just in portland yesterday and i think it's in

1486
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:32,860
boise on tuesday and it was just here in sac on uh wednesday so i actually went downtown and it

1487
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:36,540
was there was about 75 people there because you know ingress doesn't have quite the fan base that

1488
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:41,660
pokemon go does but it has its own loyal fan base right and um you know they they did their welcome

1489
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:45,020
and everything it was and part of i think why they're doing this is they're actually kind of

1490
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:51,180
introducing like their new community manager for like ingress at niantic who's done um a good job

1491
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:55,180
so far i would say she had a really nice write-up about the event and she was really like engaging

1492
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:59,340
with people and you know so forth i thought she did a very good job with the event overall

1493
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:02,780
but i thought what was interesting is that when she was being introduced by the other guy

1494
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:07,980
he was like you know and uh you know let her know all your feedback that you have on ingress and

1495
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:12,300
you know all the other niantic stuff too if you have feedback on pokemon go or harry and you could

1496
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:18,380
just see her eyes kind of went like like shut up shut up don't no no i don't want to talk about

1497
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:28,380
the game because that was well it was she was at least uh but she uh i quit on friday yeah but

1498
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:33,980
the community matter for pokemon go actually quit yeah i heard that not the same person just to be

1499
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:38,860
clear but yes i heard that whole thing as well it's very interesting but i just a funny anecdote

1500
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:43,420
your story kind of or your your comment reminded me to tell about the whole like taking feedback

1501
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:46,620
like she's still kind of like you know smiling like sure i'll hear what you have to say because

1502
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:52,300
luckily it's only 75 people and most of them care primarily about ingress right but there's

1503
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:56,860
there's a hell of a lot of overlap there were plenty of people wearing pokemon go shirts

1504
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:01,740
and i certainly have my little pokeball because we do what i call dual wielding we're playing

1505
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:05,820
ingress on our phone and we're bluetooth catching on the pokeball we're dual wielding the games so

1506
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:10,700
there's a lot of us that do play both so it's just uh i thought that i thought that was interesting

1507
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:16,140
how she she kind of was like i i've opened because that was the same day as that letter

1508
02:29:16,140 --> 02:29:19,420
i think so i think she was very much like i want to talk about it i want to talk about it

1509
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:24,940
i'm not i don't have my bullet points they probably knew if it was wednesday and the on the

1510
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:32,780
letter thing was thursday they oh they probably knew because the letter was made by influencers

1511
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:38,300
who worked with niantic on pokemon go anyway it was brewing it was brewing it was definitely like

1512
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:44,940
you knew like people were pissed so anyway uh mike deft uh the rebranded act f mike deaf thank

02:30:54,380 --> 02:30:59,820
we might hear a similar topic but that's that's okay yes that's okay this is this is a good thing

1528
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:03,900
for people to know about so tell us uh what's what what would you like to talk about tonight

1529
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:07,260
so uh it all started with some reddit thread um

1530
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:23,420
a couple weeks ago i posted a thread on reddit uh asking if uh you know hearthstone could be

1531
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:30,540
modded to be accessible and i got just quite a bit of sorry i don't mean to cut you off but i

1532
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:34,300
want to make sure our listeners who don't already know know because you've called into the show

1533
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:39,500
before but admittedly in this covet age we haven't been taking a lot of phone calls for a bit so um i

1534
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:44,220
just want to make sure those that don't know know that you are a blind gamer and you've often called

1535
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:49,260
into the show kind of talking about um games that have like awesome accessibility things like the

1536
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:54,380
last of us part two and um you know so forth and games are not so great accessibility because i

1537
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:59,260
think these are good things for us to sort of keep in mind is that hey there's lots of people

1538
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:04,380
out there that would like to play games but sometimes can't and so this is with you and

1539
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:08,380
hearthstone so sorry i just want to make sure people have that background yeah yeah yep no

1540
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:15,820
problem um and you know the the thread got quite a bit of traction and a lot of people are like oh

1541
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:21,740
that would actually be really cool and then you know there were some people that were interested

1542
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:26,140
and and you know thoughtful and but there are a lot of people were just like i don't know how this

1543
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:33,180
could be done and some people were even like well this might be against blizzard tos you know to add

1544
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:42,940
keyboard support um i can tell you that that's not going to be a concern um for reasons i'll get into

1545
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:52,460
later but um so that you know i that thread goes on for like a day day and a half and kind of

1546
02:32:52,460 --> 02:33:01,100
fizzles out because you know reddit um and i didn't really you know think anything of it

1547
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:08,860
it's like yeah you know it would have been cool if something came of it um but then i got a couple

1548
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:16,940
that someone a couple people added me on reddit like look at this and uh turns out somebody had

1549
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:24,780
already been working behind the scenes in secret for i guess months like completely independent of

1550
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:35,900
my thread to make hearthstone uh accessible to blind people nice and uh it's you know it's pretty

1551
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:43,820
you know it's pretty basic right now i mean it's it works very very well like battling works

1552
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:51,180
flawlessly um what is lacking currently is uh selecting other modes and deck editing

1553
02:33:51,980 --> 02:33:56,060
and things like that but uh he wants to keep working on it and

1554
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:04,060
yeah so basically what this does is it interfaces with your screen reader and you have a lot of

1555
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:07,260
keyboard shortcuts to get to various parts of the field

1556
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:15,900
and uh sorry i think i interrupted you no you're fine you're fine i want to make sure you you get

1557
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:19,820
your piece out because i think it's important for people to know like you know kind of like

1558
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:26,140
how this makes the experience um accessible for you um yeah but one thing i want to kind of with

1559
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:30,860
the with the terms of service and the tos that whole thing i think the last thing blizzard needs

1560
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:35,580
right now is a case on their hands where they shut down a mod that is making a game more accessible

1561
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:40,620
um that is not the pr story blizzard needs right now so like um this this this will be in the clear

1562
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:49,980
yeah no absolutely yeah well plus plus um there is a known blizzard uh developer oh named nikki

1563
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:57,100
crenshaw uh who frequents a friend of mine uh super blind man uh he's a blind streamer

1564
02:34:58,060 --> 02:35:07,420
uh he streamed this on on friday when it came out and she happened to tune in and uh saw this and

1565
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:12,060
she was just over the moon and apparently she showed it around to the the office and people

1566
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:17,820
are just oh my gosh this is insane so that that those are those now that's good because

1567
02:35:17,820 --> 02:35:22,540
especially if she was you know one person is one person but if she was showing other people in the

1568
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:28,140
office now that's a conversation and that might lead to the whole well how did this guy do it

1569
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:32,540
maybe we should do this and blizzard does have a track record and from having covered world

1570
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:37,020
warcraft for years and years blizzard at least the old blizzard but i don't see why you know

1571
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:40,620
there's a lot of great people at blizzard still there's still yeah really good people at blizzard

1572
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:45,660
even if some of the execs are crappy people exactly um and that's why that's why i don't

1573
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:52,460
feel bad about playing this and and supporting because there's also rumors that diablo 2 is

1574
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:58,620
going to be accessible so you can absolutely do both but i was going to say yeah wow wow did have

1575
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:04,300
that track record of if a mod was really popular they like deadly boss mods was like almost like

1576
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:09,020
a must-have mod for raid boss encounters they ended up yeah they ended up like incorporating

1577
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:13,980
some of that into the main game so they they do look at the mods out there and the stuff that's

1578
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:19,980
really popular they do have a tendency to kind of so that could bode very well for this um but let

1579
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:25,820
me we're hoping we're hoping we uh we're hoping that like they decide i don't know if they're

1580
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:31,980
going to but it would be awesome if uh you know blizzard you know gets a hold of them like hey

1581
02:36:31,980 --> 02:36:39,180
let's uh let's talk let's talk about how this works um let me ask you this though before uh

1582
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:42,860
you know because uh we do have to wrap things up here pretty soon but i want to make sure uh i get

1583
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:48,060
your opinion you know accessibility issues aside now that you've had the chance to play hearthstone

1584
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:56,620
how do you like hearthstone as a game so good it's so good i just unlocked uh all the classes

1585
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:04,540
and uh still working on getting the initial levels you know up to 10 to get the core the core cards

1586
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:11,740
and uh i actually played a couple online matches even though so you can't i'm not gonna get into

1587
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:17,180
specifics but there's a way with your screen reader even though it's not supported in the mod

1588
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:23,580
itself to get there accessibly there's a way to do it where you can get to um online matches so

1589
02:37:23,580 --> 02:37:29,820
i've actually played a few uh online matches and so i'm kind of working on clawing my way out of

1590
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:37,660
apprentice which is the basically like the newbie ranks yeah um and you get more cards by by

1591
02:37:37,660 --> 02:37:42,620
completing that so you know if nothing else i hope blizzard doesn't just hear about that i'm

1592
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:47,900
so happy it's accessible but i hope blizzard hears that enthusiasm when you said it's so good

1593
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:52,380
i hope that is what's heard where it's like hey by implementing something like this officially

1594
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:56,780
you can make a lot of people say what you just said about hearthstone and i think that that

1595
02:37:56,780 --> 02:38:02,380
should be the most exciting getting it is getting like it's spread around now like a lot of the

1596
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:09,740
blind community is playing it and is super excited about it so um yeah i i'm looking

1597
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:14,460
forward i'm looking forward to deck building and uh packet opening because those are things that

1598
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:22,940
are not currently uh accessible yet but uh hopefully soon all right well sterlock i'm

1599
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:26,940
gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you i appreciate the update and uh what's

1600
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:30,700
going on there i think that's good stuff for people to know about and uh keep us posted on

1601
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:35,500
future um efforts for more games um to get those sorts of features i'd love to hear your take on

1602
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:42,540
it definitely all right take care of my friend yeah you too all right bye-bye all right and

1603
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:48,220
with that i think we are uh going to oh if i can find the right shot there there we go uh we're

1604
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:52,300
going to get into a few more segments here and then we're going to wrap up here uh let me get to

1605
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:55,740
last minute stories loki i don't know if you have anything tonight but do you have any last minute

1606
02:38:55,740 --> 02:39:02,140
stories i did have one thing so there was a deal that happened this week between uh trade parker

1607
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:09,020
and matt stone with viacom cvs regarding south park so they're gonna be bringing like 14 movies

1608
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:16,700
um several seasons and a video game um in the works apparently so we're getting another south

1609
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:21,660
park video game at some point so that's pretty awesome i'm not surprised those games have done

1610
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:28,380
pretty well but i've it is interesting how is it that these animated series are on forever like

1611
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:35,580
south simpsons has been on forever uh south park uh forever family guy feels like it's been on

1612
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:40,060
forever uh futurama has got to be getting good is is that show still on i think that's getting

1613
02:39:40,060 --> 02:39:45,100
canceled oh has it oh i feel like i'm still seeing it all the time so okay all right but still i feel

1614
02:39:45,100 --> 02:39:49,260
like like wow there's a lot of animated shows that go on for a very long time but you know why this

1615
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:53,900
one's interesting because when i first read it and you know insert whatever joke you want about

1616
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:57,500
south park being relevant all this stuff look it's just i i just want to talk about the deal itself

1617
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:03,740
the the whole fact that they they've commissioned 14 movies you know that whole thing is just a

1618
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:10,620
workaround right because hbo max through comedy central has the right to south park or no no

1619
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:15,260
because comedy central is part of viacom but hbo max or somehow has the deal for one way or another

1620
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:20,780
this is paramount plus or viacom leveraging their arm to get content for paramount plus

1621
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:24,620
so the shows are going to be on hbo max at least for a couple more years and now paramount plus

1622
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:28,860
is getting its own original content as well that's the part i think is fascinating about the deal

1623
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:34,300
how they kind of strong-armed their own content for paramount plus because yo drag race all-stars

1624
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:39,500
season six is going to be over in a few more weeks whenever they finish their game within a game so

1625
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:45,980
it's time for new original content i guess huh i guess yeah yeah for sure that's cool

1626
02:40:45,980 --> 02:40:51,260
yeah for sure um all right uh one other thing and yes thank you i'm glad you brought this up

1627
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:57,020
uh as joe and her to matt because i saw your uh post in our discord about it over at vog network

1628
02:40:57,020 --> 02:41:00,620
dot com slash discord if you want to join our discord and chat with us throughout the week

1629
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:06,060
um as joe and her matt says thoughts on the cookie clicker i said cookie clitter i almost did

1630
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:11,980
cookie clicker remaster and yes that is they are remastering cookie clicker

1631
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:17,900
and bringing it back i don't know how to feel about it i would rather see a clicker heroes

1632
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:21,900
remaster because the sequel wasn't that good the sequel wasn't as good as the first one

1633
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:29,660
so that's uh that's what it is pixel pakas just put rob in all caps i can't help it

1634
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:39,820
rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob all right i can bring that back you know what's that

1635
02:41:40,380 --> 02:41:46,860
i could bring that back you could you could um let's see uh there was a car or there was a

1636
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:52,060
question from no one special 77 earlier before we started in the phone calls here we go uh and i

1637
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:58,140
thought this was worth addressing real quick here in the spirit of the flag this week i'll ask this

1638
02:41:58,700 --> 02:42:05,260
what's the weirdest game you personally have played and he didn't specify arcade so we've

1639
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:09,180
been talking about the weird arcade games through dark soccer segment maybe the weird

1640
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:14,300
console games that you've played what are some what's the weirdest console game you've played

1641
02:42:14,300 --> 02:42:19,500
well the weirdest game i've played in the arcade isn't all that weird but uh probably prop cycle

1642
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:25,900
i love prop cycle i love it it's not it's not it's just an unusual game it's not like terrible

1643
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:31,260
not bad it's just fun i'll go one step further and say the prop cycle adams family that's what

1644
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:36,540
i was gonna say i was gonna say what the yeah the prop cycle adams family stop stealing a potential

1645
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:46,700
idea well you said it first you stole it from me so they have a prop cycle ab family game like you

1646
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:53,180
power you you have to run the prop cycle to power the machine isn't it like that oh that okay i

1647
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:56,620
thought it was like an actual prop cycle game where you like fly around through like the adams

1648
02:42:56,620 --> 02:43:01,100
family house or something like that i was like that sounds really cool why haven't i seen that

1649
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:04,540
but no that's that's different okay i'll talk about something not in the arcade you know what

1650
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:10,220
was a weird game nintendo dogs that game was a little weird i mean it was cute i'm not saying

1651
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:14,860
i'm not saying it wasn't cute i'm just saying it was happy petting sim and they didn't they didn't

1652
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:18,940
really take it as far as they should have in my opinion i'm surprised we never really got a true

1653
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:23,820
i know there was the nintendo dogs plus cats for the 3ds but i'm surprised we never got like a

1654
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:28,620
proper switch sequel and we just had all the knockoff stuff instead you know what else was

1655
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:33,740
connect the moles you know what are you not impressed by connect the moles here's another

1656
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:39,260
weird game the cooking mama game that mined bitcoin that's a weird game although that wasn't

1657
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:44,300
true but in in my brain my head canon is it was true cooking mama things like scribble knots

1658
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:50,460
oh that's a good one scribble knots is good there's a lot of scribble knots games man there's

1659
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:57,660
a all very strange oh magic pen gel that game yeah that legend at the apartment that loki and

1660
02:43:57,660 --> 02:44:06,300
i used to live in absolutely time to penis all right i mean and let's not even start about uh

1661
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:13,900
nobi nobi boy which i played a lot of ribbon so no nobi nobi boy man i rock those shirts i have

1662
02:44:13,900 --> 02:44:19,420
two nobi nobi boy shirts and i wear rock those every day i agree with sturlock tulip was an

1663
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:25,660
interesting game yeah it was also that dream simulator game that came out that i played very

1664
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:33,340

1696
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:34,220
came off of my neck today from the surgery a couple weeks ago and i'm happy to say and

1697
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:39,900
i'm turning around for the camera here on twitch i'm happy to say it looks pretty fucking normal

1698
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:43,660
back there there's just a very thin red light you probably can't even see it on the camera at this

1699
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:47,740
point there's just a very thin red line and probably what's going to be a pretty bitching

1700
02:47:47,740 --> 02:47:51,420
scar but it's really not much going on back there so that's pretty exciting

1701
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:58,380
and three in three more days i can get into pool again and submersion water so there's that all

1702
