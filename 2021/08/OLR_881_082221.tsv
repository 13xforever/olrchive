0	14240	25 years ago, years truly was downloading games via Zmodem, AOL channels, playing on
14240	16080	the Imagination Network somewhere around then too.
16080	20240	I played Doom, I played Duke Nukem 3D, but then the brown medieval trappings of Quake
20240	21300	called my name.
21300	24000	And now, 25 years later, I'm doing it all over again.
24000	25000	And you know what?
25000	26380	I am just fine with that.
26380	27380	Or at least I will do it this week.
27380	28960	It's been a busy weekend, okay?
28960	30360	This is the end of the game on my two playlists.
30360	33480	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
33480	36300	this anniversary and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show
36300	37300	where every gamer has a voice.
37300	38300	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
38300	46320	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46320	53640	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 881
53640	57380	of our show for this August the 22nd of 2021.
57380	61280	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm happy to be with you week after week here on Sunday
61280	65340	nights where we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
65340	70380	Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
70380	75420	And joining me as they do every week, except last week, but say hello to DarkSakra or Jamie
75420	76420	Summers.
76420	77420	Hi.
77420	78420	Hi.
78420	81460	I understand you haven't been feeling well, but I'm glad you're back.
81460	82460	Yeah.
82460	87660	I had an upper respiratory infection and now it's a sinus infection.
87660	96260	So I'm on some good antibiotics and hopefully I'll be back to normal in no time.
96260	98140	I feel a lot better than I did last week.
98140	99740	Well, two things with that.
99740	104520	Number one, at least it wasn't the big C and number two, your wig looks marvelous.
104520	107020	So it's a wig.
107020	108580	I bleached all this shit.
108580	109580	Sorry.
109580	110580	Kidding.
110580	111580	It's a wig.
111700	112700	I don't wear wigs.
112700	113700	Yes.
113700	114700	I understand.
114700	115700	All right.
115700	116700	Oh.
116700	117700	Oh, go ahead.
117700	118700	Nothing.
118700	119700	I'll bring it up during my game.
119700	120700	All right.
120700	124420	Uh, say hello to somebody else who only wears their natural hair on this program.
124420	126480	Say hello to type master Loki.
126480	127480	As little bit as I can.
127480	128480	I got a haircut.
128480	133240	That's the reason I understand what I have to tell me it's too long.
133240	134240	What little bit is left?
134240	135240	You have to work with.
135240	136980	I understand that struggle very well.
136980	138840	Well, no, no, it's not going away.
138840	140340	I'm making it go away.
141100	145100	I always buzz it so that I don't have to comb it.
145100	146100	Must be nice.
146100	147100	Can't relate.
147100	148100	Good thing.
148100	149100	I like hats.
149100	152060	I just, I'm just giving you crap.
152060	155040	What's what's the game playing behind you tonight, Loki, for those that are watching
155040	156040	live on Twitch?
156040	162140	Uh, one of the last greatest saints row games that there was saints row two, actually saints
162140	163140	row three.
163140	164140	Wasn't bad.
164140	165140	We don't talk about saints row four though.
165140	166140	Yeah.
166140	167140	Saints row three was a lot of fun.
167140	168260	Like I, again, I've said this before on the show.
168260	172520	I don't think I've ever laughed harder playing a video game than I did those opening moments
172520	173520	of saints row three.
173520	175780	Like, it's just so fucking funny.
175780	180460	Saints row three felt like the saints row that the writer's strike hit that like it
180460	186300	was pretty good, but then they made some really stupid decisions like story wise.
186300	190620	It's like, Hey, you know, that character that you're really liking is one of the best characters
190620	191620	in the game.
191620	192620	Yeah.
192620	193620	We're going to kill them off in the beginning of the game.
193620	194620	Isn't that fun?
194620	195620	Isn't that fun?
195620	197620	Don't you guys enjoy that?
197980	199540	Surprise.
199540	201500	So it's like the matrix online.
201500	202500	Everything is led up to this.
202500	208440	Then they retcon that bullshit into a new game and then like they try to retcon it again.
208440	211980	Now they're retconning the whole thing, which is I'm totally cool with.
211980	212980	All right.
212980	214860	But we'll get to that later in the show.
214860	219660	First off, we're going to start off with tonight's kickoff topic, which is actually a little
219660	222820	bit more of a serious topic because it's a serious problem that's happening all over
222820	227180	Twitch and we need to talk about these hate raids that are occurring on Twitch.
227740	231900	It is a show about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
231900	236540	And this is certainly, unfortunately, a part of what gaming cultures become because Twitch
236540	238580	is so prevalent in our culture.
238580	240780	And unfortunately, it's affecting people's lifestyles.
240780	244620	So this qualifies for discussion on tonight's show.
244620	247460	And let's just be real, these hate raids suck.
247460	254660	They've been occurring 99.99% on a marginalized communities channel.
254660	261620	Unfortunately, some of the fear about all of these new tags may be used to harass certain
261620	267220	individuals certainly seems to be the case as we see several black streamers are getting
267220	268500	targeted with this.
268500	271700	Several trans streamers are getting targeted with this.
271700	272700	Lots of folks across.
272700	273700	Friends of mine.
273700	274700	Yeah.
274700	275700	Oh yeah.
275700	283420	I was watching LC one night when this happened to him and he shut off the alerts as you usually
283420	287420	do and you know, all that stuff and you know, just try to play it off and acting normal,
287420	289620	but it's irritating, right?
289620	293900	Especially when, you know, sure, it's really easy to hit the button and stop this stuff
293900	294900	from happening.
294900	297980	I mean, heaven forbid it ever happened here at VoG network, but our policy, you know,
297980	300940	we have a plan if it were to happen here.
300940	305260	Number one is don't acknowledge it because that's what the folks want.
305260	308800	It is very easy for me to suddenly turn off the little bar at the bottom that shows everybody
308800	309900	who's following.
309900	313580	I think this is a good thing that ours is a little more subtle because we're recording
313580	314820	a podcast.
314820	315900	Most streamers don't do that.
315900	319360	They have little with a little name that comes up really big because they want to read it.
319360	323620	You know, thank you so and so for the follow, but the hate Raiders obviously exploit that
323620	328740	to try to get streamers to stay, say memes and you know, stupid jokes and things like
328740	331300	that, but we can turn that off relatively quickly.
331300	336180	And thankfully 90% of the time Bobby's here and he'll have this thing in sub mode in two
336180	341120	seconds and I'll have ads running in three seconds.
341120	346640	So you know, unfortunately for those that don't subscribe to VoG network here on Twitch,
346640	351020	you will be inconvenienced a little bit and I apologize for that, but you can, I'm sure
351020	355020	you all understand if we have to hit the panic button because something like that's happening,
355020	357980	we're going to hit the panic button and it may be a little inconvenient.
357980	362140	It's inconvenient for us too, but we're, our, our top priority is, you know, making this
362140	365280	show that we're doing here.
365280	371180	But isn't it weird that I'm having to discuss, here's our plan, here's our thing that we're
371180	375880	going to do when it's Twitch at their level.
375880	381720	They've sent some tweets that are like, we're listening, we know it's a problem, it's unacceptable,
381720	386200	but I mean, it's still happening and what is Twitch is like, well, we can't tell you
386200	391120	what we're doing because then the Raiders, you know, are constantly working to circumvent
391120	392120	that.
392120	397520	Let that to an extent, but it really looks like you aren't doing anything Twitch.
397520	406180	I mean, when people are continuing to get these raids, perhaps explain something that
406180	411240	you implemented that already got circumvented since it was already circumvented anyway.
411240	415840	You know, let people peek behind the curtain a little more because what I find fascinating
415840	419960	is that there's, you know, individual modders and people out there that are trying to help
419960	421640	the situation.
421640	425400	Somebody put together a script that would ban like all these usernames super fast and
425400	429060	things like that, which is, it helps.
429060	431160	But it's weird that Twitch isn't doing that.
431160	432800	Do you want to say something, Jamie?
432800	438280	Oh, I was going to say, Burban was talking about using that earlier today.
438280	442160	I was trying to get the link, but I had to hop out of his stream to come here.
442160	443160	Yeah, no, I understand.
443160	445160	Loki, what were you going to say?
445160	449000	I was going to say, I don't understand what it is that they're doing that they feel that
449000	450840	they can't discuss it.
450840	457520	If it's going to be that easily circumvented, if they mention it like, then that's obviously
457520	458760	not the approach to take.
458760	462520	If it's going to be that easily circumvented, I mean, I don't understand what the problem
462520	463520	is.
463520	467320	Well, and honestly, and I put this in a tweet and this is my honest to God feedback on this
467320	471520	whole thing is that Twitch, if you're serious about this, the easiest way you could counter
471520	476600	this today is disabled the ability to create a new account done.
476640	479960	And I know people are saying they're going, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of Twitch
479960	480960	money?
480960	482160	Yeah, they want money.
482160	483160	They want this growth.
483160	490120	Well, Twitch, clearly you can't handle the growth, Twitch, if you aren't able to deal
490120	491120	with this issue.
491120	496320	And I think an action like that, as drastic as it may seem, well, guess what?
496320	500240	Twitch needs to show they're doing something drastic about the issues.
500240	504680	Drastic times call for drastic measures, and I think they should disable the creation of
504680	506760	new accounts until they fix this.
506760	508640	All of you watching right now have an account.
508640	512740	And I would bet even the people listening on the podcast feed probably already have
512740	514000	an account.
514000	517320	Most people that are going to participate in Twitch already have an account.
517320	523040	Now sure, there are people that aged 18 every day and maybe want to get on Twitch for the
523040	524040	first time.
524040	528720	I understand a couple weeks of inconvenience is going to be worth it in the long run.
528720	532480	And it'll, it would, it would be Twitch showing they're serious about this and they're trying
532480	534240	to do something about this.
534240	535780	And that's, that's the hill.
535780	536960	Is this the hill over here?
536960	538200	Because I'll go die on it.
538200	540440	This is what Twitch should do right now.
540440	544000	Disable the ability to create a new account.
544000	548520	Or if you want to toss me the bare fucking minimum, you want to give me a little grass
548520	552280	on that hill, at least make it harder to make an account.
552280	555480	Because right now it's not hard to make an account on Twitch.
555480	559420	And that's what the bots are exploiting.
559420	561940	You know, or look at the accounts that are being made.
561940	567620	If they're making like, you know, John Doe, one, two, three, John Doe, one, two, four,
567620	569680	John Doe, one, two, five.
569680	574500	If those three accounts are made in like a five minute span, the system should be able
574500	578380	to detect that something's afoot and like stop that immediately.
578380	586300	So I'll tell you something that happened with my stream at midnight that I had.
586300	591700	Is I kept seeing this thing like lunar underscore this, lunar underscore that, lunar underscore
591700	592700	this.
592700	598460	And it would happen like maybe every 20 minutes or so.
598460	604940	And thankfully, Finara was in there last night to help me with the ban hammer, but I was,
604940	612080	I had to ban them like the moment that they would come in and my, my, my channel is follower
612080	617200	only right now for, for chat.
617200	618760	And that's, and that's the bummer.
618760	620840	That's what most people are having to do, which sucks.
620840	624320	And you know, I'm sitting here talking about, well, our plan is I'm going to hit this button
624320	627120	that's going to fuck over anyone who doesn't pay us money.
627120	628120	And I hate that.
628120	633860	I hate that situation that we're in, but I'm going to do it to silence the hate if I have
633860	635800	to.
635800	638560	And I imagine there's a lot of people out there for their communities.
638560	639560	They don't want to do this.
639560	643800	They don't want to lessen the amount of people, legitimate people that can participate with
643800	644800	their community.
644800	648840	But Twitch is putting us in this position and what's pissing a lot of people off about
648840	651880	it is that Twitch takes half our income.
651880	652880	Everybody knows that, right?
652880	655640	I say our income, like we're making a ton of money here at VoG network.
655640	656640	We're not.
656640	657640	We're pretty transparent.
657640	658640	We're tier one subs.
658640	659640	Yeah.
659640	660640	Yeah.
660640	664160	So tier one subs cost $5, right?
664160	669220	And the, the broadcaster gets $2 and 50 cents of that, that currency obviously varies from
669220	673700	country to country, but it's basically $5 or the equivalent and the broadcaster gets
673700	674700	half of it, two fifties.
674700	679620	That means Twitch is pocketing the other $2 and 50 cents for what?
679620	680620	The bandwidth.
680620	681620	Okay.
681620	685740	The, um, the brokerage of selling the ads, which, you know, we're going to come back
685740	687780	to that point in a minute and all this other stuff.
687780	688780	Okay.
688780	689780	I get that.
689780	695020	But part of that is also creating a safe and secure place because we're bringing our communities
695020	696020	here.
696020	699020	Y'all want us to bleed purple, right?
699020	704380	Well, it's also going a little bit beyond that too, because, um, people have had to
704380	712780	shut off, uh, uh, permanent discord invite links, um, which, um, I haven't, I had the
712780	718460	problem once and thankfully other people caught it and it was taken care of before I had to,
718460	720060	to deal with it too much.
720060	721060	And thank you everybody.
721060	722060	Thank you.
722060	725660	Actually, Mike Deft in chat who, who really was phenomenal and helping me, helping me
725660	726660	with that.
726660	731700	But they're going in and also finding those discord links and rating discord channels
731700	733700	as well.
733700	735980	Yup.
735980	739780	And uh, I'm not going to tell you specifically how the contingency plan works at VOG, but
739780	746060	we, we, we have a way to, uh, mix that up if we need to, you know, and, um, but it's
746060	747060	stupid.
747060	749860	Like we should, we shouldn't have to take these precautions in the first place.
749860	755820	Um, yeah, anyway, um, so what's being done about it, uh, from the user perspective?
755820	760700	Well, there's been calls for a day off Twitch basically, uh, and that's what it is.
760700	765940	Hashtag a day off Twitch, several streamers got together to say that they are going to
765940	770140	boycott Twitch on September 1st is the day of the big boycott.
770140	772580	Um, and, uh, that means don't watch it.
772580	773700	That means don't stream on it.
773700	777180	And I'll tell you, there's a lot extra convenient for me cause it's my anniversary.
777180	781380	Well, and you know, yeah, and for me, I'm going to be in the air on my way to dragon
781380	785580	con, so I wouldn't have really been able to participate anyway, but I'm still there in
785580	788780	spirit and actually go ahead.
788780	792740	I was going to say, I've, I've posted to take it a step further and turn off all of your
792740	797540	hosting, make your channel dead for the day.
797540	803220	I think that's a great idea, especially if you are hosting somebody and they are alive
803220	809600	on that day and should know better, you shouldn't be giving them the attention to for breaking
809600	810600	the boycott.
810600	817440	If a marginalized person who relies on Twitch for income wants to go live on September 1st
817440	822720	because they can't get by without it, I'm not going to judge that, but I'm not going
822720	823720	to judge that.
823720	830240	But I mean, most of the people that I have on my auto host, yeah, yeah, exactly.
830240	832080	Most people don't fall in that category.
832080	833080	Yeah.
833080	838240	Um, but I just, I kind of want to put the little parentheses like I, I fully support
838240	841680	the boycott parentheses, but I understand there are those who can't do it.
841680	848880	So, you know, and that whole thing, um, but, um, yeah, and, and actually something I suggested
848880	852120	on Twitter that, um, you know, I'm probably not the only person to think of this, but
852120	854720	I swear I thought of it all by myself and I'm going to pat myself on the back.
854720	856200	I think this is a great idea.
856200	861120	I think September 1st is a day you celebrate your community somewhere else, meaning don't
861120	862120	do Twitch.
862120	863120	Why not?
863120	867300	This is the day that you create a YouTube or this is the day that you make a podcast.
867300	870880	This is the day that you get on your discord in a private channel because discord lets
870880	872380	you stream in there too.
872380	873380	And you stream to your community.
873380	874380	Lots of us have TikToks.
874380	875380	What's that?
875380	876380	Lots of us have TikToks.
876380	877380	Yeah.
877380	878380	TikToks.
878380	881460	So we'll put like highlight reels and stuff up.
881460	888620	In my opinion, it's more powerful to show ways that you can support your community without
888620	892360	Twitch, I think sends a bigger message in my opinion.
892360	895540	But that of course leads to this other discussion where a lot of people are like, well, I'm
895540	899940	just going to leave Twitch and go somewhere else to which I'm going to say, where, where
899940	905460	like there are, and I'm sorry, there's no big competitor to Twitch right now.
905460	911160	YouTube I guess, but you know, and there's all these other up and coming companies I've
911160	913960	heard of things like what is that Altair, Altair?
913960	916460	I've heard of other places and don't get me wrong.
916460	918400	I'm rooting for these underdogs.
918400	920220	I'm rooting for them.
920220	925420	But here's the thing, Twitch makes it very easy to start making money.
925420	929020	So you know how I said earlier, half that money goes to them brokering ads and all that
929020	930020	stuff.
930020	931020	Yeah.
931020	933860	Twitch makes it very easy to start making money on Twitch and the fact that they're
933860	938140	owned by Amazon kind of helps because if nothing else, Amazon's always going to step in there
938140	941760	to show, you know, Billie Eilish or whatever the hell's going on on Amazon prime right
941760	942760	now.
942760	948800	So the reality is, and again, many people are relying on Twitch for either supplemental
948800	953640	income or income, or even just the folks that are like, it's kind of fun to get a check
953640	960080	for $100 even if it's twice a year, if that, you know, it's kind of fun to see that happen.
960080	964360	And so it makes people a little bit hesitant to just jump off and go somewhere else.
964360	971080	So like we have to really like before we just say we're going to go somewhere else where
971080	972960	like who's built up to that level yet?
972960	977760	I mean, maybe YouTube, but even YouTube, I think it's a lot harder to make money on YouTube,
977760	981240	but once you kind of get in there, you can probably make a lot more to be honest.
981840	986520	Just depending on what level creator you are, just once you get in there, you know, yeah,
986520	988120	however many years that'll take.
988120	989120	Right.
989120	995480	And so, you know, getting 50 followers and three viewers at a time, that isn't insurmountable.
995480	999600	That's very achievable for many people.
999600	1004140	YouTube wants what, is it 10,000 followers on your channel now?
1004140	1005140	It's a lot.
1005140	1012980	It's 1000 subscribers and I can't remember the watch hours is, but it's like, you know,
1012980	1018700	a large amount of watch hours, 50 followers, 1000 followers.
1018700	1021620	Who's got the easier bar to get in there and make money?
1021620	1023660	We don't even have 1000 followers here on volume.
1023660	1025460	I certainly don't have that on my personal channel.
1025460	1028820	And that's also assuming that everything goes fine with YouTube.
1028820	1035840	It's just like randomly, hey, today we deleted your channel, you know, for a reason.
1035840	1040880	Hey, today we disabled monetization from your channel because you're putting out too much
1040880	1046880	content that is, your content is not engaging enough or something like that.
1046880	1052440	Or you're recycling content, even though you're not, you know, it's just plagued with bots,
1052440	1054480	different types of bots.
1054480	1061720	But also, you know, you have the problems with these large platforms that they are to
1061720	1068200	the size now where they can't automate, they basically can't regulate themselves using
1068200	1069200	people.
1069200	1073920	They have to rely on bots to do everything and the bots are stupid.
1073920	1074920	I agree.
1074920	1077660	And that's part of my issue with YouTube is that, and I've said this before, YouTube is
1077660	1079580	not very creator friendly.
1079580	1081500	They always side with bots.
1081500	1083140	And I don't know how I feel about that.
1083140	1084140	I don't, I don't love that.
1084140	1089380	And also like, yeah, the DMCA process too and copyright claims is just absolutely stupid.
1089380	1094740	It's like you get claimed by somebody, you dispute the claim and instead of a third party
1094740	1100640	looking at it, it's, it's up to the person that filed the claim to decide, Hey, you know,
1100640	1102340	do I still think that the claim is fair?
1102340	1107900	And I mean, if it's done in bad faith, I mean, you're really the only way you could possibly,
1107900	1114900	you know, do anything about it is to, you know, file another claim or like a final counterclaim
1114900	1116400	or something like that and take them to court.
1116400	1117980	I don't know.
1117980	1119380	It's very risky.
1119380	1125820	And a lot of these companies will throw around their, their weight as a big company, Activision,
1125820	1131860	for example, where they will, you know, copyright claim videos talking about, you know, the
1131860	1136820	new call of duty and leaking information about it.
1136820	1139860	Sorry that you don't like the information being leaked about your game, but it's not
1139860	1140860	game footage.
1140860	1144420	So you can, you know, what can you do?
1144420	1148900	You can go fix your own problems within your company and stop taking up your lead.
1148900	1150540	It's like, what are they going to do?
1150540	1153860	I mean, you could fight them in court, but it's like their Activision with billions of
1153860	1157300	dollars and legal teams and you're Joe, nobody.
1157300	1158940	So what are you gonna do?
1158940	1162180	All right, let's go to our chat room because of course I do want to get you guys and your
1162180	1163520	thoughts here on the show as well.
1163520	1169120	So over twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, let's all go to mixer.
1169120	1173920	You know, I think that I get that that comment has said tongue firmly planted in cheek, but
1173920	1178960	it also goes to show that any of these platforms where anybody is making a significant amount
1178960	1182000	of monetization could go away at any time.
1182000	1186960	And I think of our friends over at black compat who used to have a show at vog network years
1186960	1188680	ago called the electric sisterhood.
1188680	1192960	If you're not following their, their new rebrand here on twitch black compat, I urge you to
1193880	1195000	because they're fabulous.
1195840	1199400	But my point is they were on mixer and they built up on mixer.
1199400	1202920	And I think Bobby, correct me if I'm wrong, I think they were mixer partner or whatever the
1202920	1208360	equivalent is over there, because I know like they are very in like with Microsoft and
1208360	1213240	Xbox. And I think at least one of them is an Xbox, Xbox VIP, if not both.
1214080	1216200	So, you know, I know there's a lot of love there.
1216200	1218560	So them being a mixer made a lot of sense.
1219340	1220720	And then one day mixer shut down.
1221000	1226920	And so they've had to rebuild over here on Twitch, which, you know, they've done a great
1226920	1230480	job, but it still sucks to have to build that up.
1230680	1233800	Thank you. Bobby says they were and only one is an MVP.
1233800	1236840	So sorry, I just I couldn't remember the terms and all that stuff.
1236840	1241760	But yes, I knew they were very engaged with the Xbox ecosystem.
1241760	1245480	So but yeah, I mean, you can all go away one day.
1246360	1252920	There's also just in Twitch in particular, this happened to one of my newer friends,
1254320	1257840	Fitness to Cosplay, I don't know if you've ever caught their channel.
1258840	1261280	That's a Twitter account that follows me.
1261360	1263080	I feel like I've seen that name before.
1263560	1265720	Yeah, really, really, really sweet person.
1266120	1276360	But at any rate, in trying to remove the the bots and all of the the, you know, various
1277400	1281280	raiders and things, they lost all of their followers.
1281280	1282720	They accidentally banned everybody.
1283320	1285600	Yeah, I've I've heard of this elsewhere, too.
1285600	1286920	Yeah. Yeah.
1286920	1290960	So but it's they're not the only one that this has happened to either.
1290960	1292560	I'm just going to throw that out there, too.
1292600	1293680	So this goes.
1295120	1302240	Broader than the consequence, I'd say the aftermath of it has been deeper.
1303800	1310640	So anyway, you know, I I'm participating, but I also am not actively participating on
1310640	1315080	September 1st, I'd love to create content on that day elsewhere, do like a stream in a
1315080	1319440	private discord or something, but unfortunately, I had already made plans for that day
1319440	1320840	and that's the day everybody decided.
1321840	1327560	So but I'm actively participating in spirit and I look forward to Twitch giving some more
1327560	1334040	details, maybe on that day as to what they're going to do about this and be, you know, a
1334040	1339480	little more than just we're listening, we're doing and just vague trees of some more
1339480	1342720	specifics. Honestly, I'm looking forward to that.
1342720	1347480	And my thoughts are with those folks that keep getting attacked with this bullshit.
1347480	1349760	Like it's just it's it's so stupid.
1349840	1352240	Like I just what is the point?
1352760	1357800	I don't even know what the I get, but I guess it's for the lols, as they say in some of the
1357800	1358920	darker parts of the Internet.
1360360	1362600	It's just silly. Nobody's laughing.
1363680	1368480	All right. Anyhow, let's let's go back to a little bit more pleasant of a topic and talk
1368480	1371560	about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1371800	1373200	And how is your gaming week?
1373200	1375160	So Darsakura, we'll go to you.
1375160	1376000	How is your gaming week?
1376680	1384240	Um, I, I played Dead by Daylight, Fantasian Part Two came out, so I played that on
1384240	1387680	Tuesday, but my game froze.
1388160	1390720	So I guess maybe there's some bugs to work out.
1390960	1395600	But I lost my entire first battle, which was a long and fucking annoying battle.
1395920	1402040	So I will be, I guess, starting it over again on this upcoming Tuesday.
1403000	1404200	We are starting over.
1405040	1412120	Uh, I have made a new character on Final Fantasy 14 on Midgar Samara, so still on
1412120	1412560	Aether.
1412920	1416600	I wanted to go on Gilgamesh, but there's no room.
1417640	1420080	So now I have three characters on the same server.
1420200	1420760	Go fig.
1421480	1424480	Um, I'm going to start off with a Thaumaturge this time.
1426040	1426840	A Dertmaturge?
1427800	1428520	A Dertmaturge.
1428720	1430600	Yeah, I'm playing a cat girl.
1431120	1439360	Um, and then, um, of course with Dead by Daylight, it, it took some money from me
1440200	1446040	because, and, um, I actually had wanted to put this in as a story, so I'll just go
1446040	1446880	ahead and say it now.
1447880	1454920	Um, the Dead by Daylight DLC is going away as, I'm not Dead by Daylight, but the
1454920	1458600	Stranger Things DLC is going away as of November 17th, 2021.
1458600	1460640	Dead by Daylight's closing finally.
1460640	1461160	Yay.
1461160	1461880	Good riddance.
1461880	1463440	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
1463440	1464720	I don't, I've met too many people.
1464720	1468560	And I think this is also coinciding with chapter 21, which is the Hellraiser
1468560	1470320	channel or channel chapter.
1471200	1473080	Um, and those pinhead mechanics.
1473080	1473800	Oh my God.
1473800	1474960	I've been watching people play.
1474960	1476600	I can't do the PTB on Stadia.
1476680	1479280	We got into it a little bit on last week's show, but we didn't have the
1479280	1480280	confirmation yet.
1480280	1482640	We just had that teaser video that made it very clear.
1482640	1483080	Pretty much.
1483120	1484120	Yeah, pretty much.
1484320	1486960	But, um, yeah, now that we've gotten to see, I can't believe we didn't put it on
1487000	1487760	show world, but okay.
1487800	1490440	Um, now that we got to see it, I must've known you'd bring it up.
1490880	1494280	Uh, now that we got to see it on Tuesday on the PTB, yeah, it looks
1494280	1495520	like a really fun mechanic.
1496000	1498800	We'll go back into that in just a second, but let me finish this point.
1499360	1505360	Um, and I actually have been for anyone who had this DLC on their wishlist.
1505360	1507240	I have been gifting it to people on Steam.
1508120	1514920	Um, but the, what this is going to do is it's going to remove the ability to buy
1514920	1523400	the characters of Demogorgon, Steve or Stoven, as we also call him, uh, and
1523400	1529560	broccoli, Nancy, I'm sorry, Nancy, um, in Dead by Daylight and the Hawkins level.
1529560	1535840	Now the Hawkins, uh, laboratory map is going to be completely removed.
1535880	1536640	It's going to be gone.
1536920	1537880	Bye-bye Hawkins.
1538760	1540840	Um, because technically nobody paid for that.
1541840	1544640	You can, you can play a match on Hawkins without buying a single
1544640	1545880	piece of Stranger Things DLC.
1545880	1547440	You're not paying for that technically.
1547560	1551920	Yeah, but, um, the characters are staying in the game.
1551960	1558720	Um, but right now, um, all of the characters themselves are available
1558720	1562160	at 50% off until November 17th.
1562920	1567600	Um, and all of their cosmetics are 50% off.
1567920	1571080	So, yeah, I, I bought everybody's cosmetics.
1571120	1574720	I don't play survivor, but now I can play broccoli and Nancy if I wanted to.
1576000	1577280	You know what broccoli Nancy is, right?
1577320	1577560	Oh yeah.
1577560	1577720	Yeah.
1577720	1580040	With the, with the particular hair with that hair.
1580600	1582440	Um, so, so yeah.
1582480	1585680	Um, and I actually got, sorry, just quickly on the stranger things
1585680	1587080	before we get off of that topic.
1587320	1593280	What is interesting about that is that, um, the stranger things three RPG game is
1593280	1596600	also coming off game pass on September 1st.
1596760	1598200	So yeah, it's a big license loss.
1598240	1598400	Yeah.
1598400	1601760	There's there's Netflix is doing something with the license and what a lot of people
1601760	1605040	are forecasting that something is ties into a story that came up a couple of
1605040	1608840	weeks ago on the show about how Netflix is getting into gaming on their own and
1608840	1609360	doing their own thing.
1609360	1614080	So the stranger things license would do a lot for their own type of
1614080	1615280	game and whatever they're doing.
1615640	1618320	I still don't understand why they had to pull it from dead by daylight.
1618320	1620960	Cause it's not like, you know, it's not like,
1621000	1625280	I know why they pulled it because, um, and it's exactly what behavior said.
1625480	1626520	The license ran out.
1627880	1631280	And so they didn't, but it isn't, you would think that the Halloween license
1631280	1635920	ran out by now, but they renew it, you know, so well, but Halloween also
1635920	1641360	doesn't have any other games except for a pinball table coming out.
1641560	1642080	True.
1642600	1649400	Um, and I can certainly see Netflix wanting to do some sort of brand
1649400	1650280	protection.
1650760	1655960	They want people to think when they think of a stranger things, video game,
1656040	1660600	anything having to do with the video game, they want to think of theirs.
1660640	1661760	It's controlling the market.
1661800	1662600	That's all it is.
1662600	1663840	It's controlling perception.
1663840	1665360	It's advertising end of story.
1665640	1669840	And there's probably things Netflix doesn't care for about Freddy getting to
1669840	1674320	put Steve on a hook and that the, the sort of, even though that's the things
1674320	1677880	the horror fans love and the fans of the game love is that it is all these, you
1677920	1681800	know, and, and I love the way you've described it, the characters aren't
1681800	1684240	leaving the game, but I was saying, I love the way you've described this on the
1684240	1687400	show before, and I use this with other people too, is that it's the, it's the
1687400	1690160	Marvel cinematic universe of horror and dead by daylight.
1690480	1694960	Um, and, um, it's, I call it the multiverse, the multiverse, whatever,
1694960	1699800	but yeah, which is actually the term because the Marvel cinematic universe
1699800	1701480	is part of the Marvel multiverse.
1701840	1702320	Got it.
1702800	1710080	So, and even like in the lore, if you read the observer's, uh, personal logs,
1710640	1716080	he talks about visiting various versions of Terra as he's calling earth.
1716640	1721360	And how the entity pulls from multiple realities and crap like that.
1721360	1725600	So, yeah, so it is a multiversal game at its core.
1728240	1731160	But, um, now I got into a talk.
1731160	1735800	I actually got to talk to one of my favorite, uh, YouTube folks, um,
1736360	1741720	luminous, who does those, uh, 3d, uh, dead by daylight parodies.
1742640	1744520	You know, the one where Meg has the weird voice.
1744800	1747280	No, I don't, I don't really watch these.
1747280	1748120	They're hilarious.
1748160	1749240	They're absolutely hilarious.
1749280	1752520	I'll link their, I'll link their channel in here, but we were talking a little
1752520	1755760	bit about, um, you know, I was like, I wonder if they're just going to reskin
1755760	1760160	the Hawkins map and maybe make it into the labyrinth and they were like, no,
1760160	1762080	it wouldn't be right if they did that.
1762080	1766480	And they probably wouldn't because something about asset usage or whatever.
1766960	1771040	Um, and I kind of now agree with that sentiment that I hope
1771040	1772680	that it doesn't happen.
1772760	1777880	You know, I want Hawkins to stay dead because I'm a killer main.
1778320	1785600	Um, and I would like to see them do maybe a new map to replace it based
1785600	1789400	off of the labyrinth and how razor, and I kind of see them doing something
1789400	1795520	like that, we haven't heard if the DLC is just the hell priest.
1795760	1799480	It probably is, you know, in the, in the, it better be cheap as
1799480	1800880	fuck if it's one character.
1801200	1804640	Yeah, it's, it'll probably be like, you know, I guess like how Bubba was.
1805280	1810080	Um, I saw an excellent, um, kind of proof of concept or whatever about
1810080	1815000	turning that Hawkins map into a recording studio for the tricksters lore.
1815040	1815440	Yeah.
1815560	1818720	Uh, and I really liked that because like all those little rooms upstairs
1818720	1819480	make a lot of sense.
1819480	1823360	The big lab could turn into like a padded wall type of studio.
1823480	1825360	You know, obviously it would take a lot of work, but I thought that
1825360	1826880	was a pretty clever rework.
1826920	1827080	Yeah.
1827080	1829320	The upstairs was all like offices.
1829520	1829840	Yeah.
1829840	1830120	Yeah.
1830160	1832480	But, but, you know, still make it make a lot of sense.
1832480	1832760	Yeah.
1833560	1835240	But I, but I agree.
1835240	1840320	I agree with, uh, luminous that, um, I don't think that it's going to be
1840320	1844840	reskinned and I think it might have to do something with asset ownage ownership,
1845480	1852320	but it could be that they might rework the general layout of it.
1852680	1855280	Like the bare bones of it into something else.
1855280	1859120	I mean, I would love for trickster to have, have his own map, you know,
1859120	1861000	trickster and Eugene to have their own map.
1861560	1863680	I would love to have the hell labyrinth.
1863960	1869840	We were also talking that it would be cool to have like DLC based off of like.
1870480	1874880	The classic vampire monster, because I mean, that's public domain.
1874880	1880040	You don't need the license like nose for not to, or, or Stoker license,
1880040	1882560	you know, cause I want to, I want a vampire killer.
1884000	1886200	Well, I was saying I would love to have just Castlevania.
1886200	1887760	They can tap on Konami again.
1887880	1889200	Oh, heck yeah.
1889400	1892880	But it wouldn't make sense to have your vampire killer with
1892880	1894320	no power to kill a vampire.
1894320	1897800	So, eh, but, um, but I was thinking.
1898120	1904280	It would be interesting to have, like, you have the classic vampire,
1904320	1909840	but they have the skin that's the Nosferatu style, you know, and then
1909840	1916600	they have like a, like maybe a Van Helsing, uh, or another vampire
1916760	1921680	hunter, like descendant who might not actually be a hunter, be the person
1921680	1927360	as a survivor and that we have like this Gothic castle, you know, cause
1927800	1929680	we gotta be down with our, our gothiness.
1929720	1931120	I'm tired of goth Kate.
1931240	1933440	Enya's castle and all her cats.
1934160	1938960	No, no, but like there's a lamentable lack of goth.
1939000	1944440	I mean, there is Kate's little goth outfit, which is kind of, and then
1944440	1950720	there's, uh, Jeff, uh, in his aging death metal guar fan boy outfit.
1951800	1954080	Or, or stay with me here.
1955280	1956320	Picture this.
1956640	1958680	Sicily works.
1958760	1960480	Nine, 16, 20.
1960480	1965920	And we have, and we have vampires that are running around and they're sparkling.
1966280	1968040	It's the skin of a killer Bella.
1968080	1968680	Okay.
1969800	1973080	My wife has been watching the, the, the Twilight series again.
1973080	1974920	And it's just so stupid.
1974920	1977880	I don't, I don't give a fuck if Twilight DLC came out, I
1977880	1979240	would buy it in a heartbeat.
1979480	1980760	I would buy it in a heartbeat.
1980760	1982160	It would be so stupid and awesome.
1983040	1983520	Anyway.
1983520	1985760	But yeah, but going, going back to all of that.
1985760	1994320	Yeah, I got all of the cosmetics and everything for, for stove and Nancy.
1994760	1999600	I even have that terrible Jonathan Byers skin, which we will, he will
1999600	2006360	never get the Quint, the Quentin facelift, sad face, the Quentin facelift, by the way.
2007240	2007720	Looks great.
2007720	2010120	I'm ace and woof.
2012880	2014320	And David has more chest hair now.
2014800	2017880	And I'm gay as hell and woof.
2018880	2022360	To this day, they nerfed the booty on pyramid head.
2022600	2023360	Just saying.
2024120	2024840	That was so funny.
2024840	2025000	That was a naturalist moment.
2025000	2026680	And you know, I can't call him pee head.
2026720	2030240	We can't really call him pee pee head anymore because there's
2030240	2032400	another pee pee head now cause pinhead.
2032400	2033320	Oh yeah.
2033600	2036240	Anyway, enough dead by daylight.
2038520	2041480	Oh, and I tried to get mass effect to run, um, through steam link.
2041560	2043160	Um, which is funny.
2043160	2050520	I actually got Gary's mod to run, um, through steam link because, uh, it's
2050520	2052400	32 bit on Mac, so it won't run.
2053000	2058920	Um, but I did steam link through my, uh, windows 10 arm through parallels.
2060320	2065720	And, um, I also got, um, source filmmaker to run.
2066080	2067960	I'm going to be playing around with that on a project.
2068880	2074680	And, um, I, I played around in a little hot to full boyfriend.
2076320	2076760	Excellent.
2076880	2079000	So I actually did have a gaming week.
2079400	2083120	I've been sick as balls, but I did get some fun stuff done.
2083320	2086520	Sometimes that's when I'm able to get my gaming in is when I I'm sick
2086520	2087480	and I can't really do anything.
2087480	2088760	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2088800	2092520	Who's who's got Nick related to in.
2093440	2094360	From Debbie delight.
2094520	2097040	Um, no Gottmik the drag queen.
2097120	2100640	I'm looking at, let's see a Tabiri said he had in Gottmik had that pinhead.
2100640	2101440	Look at the finale.
2102240	2102960	That's right.
2103000	2103400	That's right.
2103400	2103800	That's right.
2103800	2104120	That's right.
2104120	2104320	Yeah.
2104640	2105080	Okay.
2105320	2107320	So anyway, man, I love Gottmik.
2108240	2109920	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2110880	2114280	Um, so it was mostly Minecraft.
2114280	2117440	I've been playing a lot of that and working on things.
2117440	2119080	Still haven't put out a video yet.
2119400	2122120	Been way behind stuff took longer as usual.
2122200	2124320	Um, and also your honor.
2125720	2126200	Yeah.
2126200	2130040	So like I wanted to, like, I had content that I filmed earlier in the week and
2130040	2134040	then it just wouldn't work with the order of which I wanted to do things.
2134040	2136000	So I have to refilm all of it.
2136400	2137960	I was going to do that last night.
2137960	2140160	And then the cat decided that she wants to sit here and
2140160	2141480	scream at me the entire time.
2141640	2145080	She has like a sixth sense, even though she can't hear of when I'm
2145080	2148840	about to record something and just sits there just screaming and screaming.
2149680	2150520	So yeah, that's fine.
2150560	2154440	But I actually did play another game this week.
2154440	2154760	Yes.
2155080	2159640	So there was a demo that came out for WarioWare get it together.
2160040	2163280	And so I did check that out on the switch because I do
2163280	2165320	like me some WarioWare games.
2165680	2168120	And it's all right.
2168160	2170400	I guess the games are fun.
2170480	2176720	Um, the, the thing this time is, you know, they have the co-op, they have different
2176720	2178720	characters, which control differently.
2179120	2183600	So it can make it a little bit of a challenge when you're playing like a
2183600	2187560	certain micro game as one character versus another.
2187560	2189160	So it's a little bit different.
2189160	2192160	It's not just like, um, you know, having to do the same
2192160	2193360	motions over and over again.
2193840	2196040	Um, so you have to figure out kind of how to do the same
2196040	2197080	thing with different characters.
2197080	2201240	So that's kind of cool, but like at the same time, some of the characters
2201240	2204960	are really annoying that I didn't really like them, but they'll probably
2204960	2205920	check it out when it comes out.
2205920	2210680	But it seemed a lot harder to me because of that mechanic they had in there.
2211120	2211440	Okay.
2211440	2213880	But I totally forgot that came out.
2213920	2214600	I have to try it.
2215240	2215520	Yeah.
2215520	2216640	It's, it's, it's all right.
2216640	2217320	I mean, it's pretty good.
2217640	2220440	Um, as you play it more, you unlock more characters and stuff like
2220440	2221920	that and get to check those out.
2222200	2225400	Um, sounds like a pretty robust demo.
2226080	2226520	Yeah.
2226560	2226840	Yeah.
2226840	2228160	So definitely check that out.
2228200	2230480	And the game comes out like 10th or 10th.
2230480	2232840	So I'll, I'll probably pick it up anyways.
2232920	2234000	Um, I don't know.
2234000	2234520	Nice.
2235120	2235360	Yeah.
2235480	2235840	Nice.
2237200	2237480	All right.
2238280	2238680	All right.
2238720	2238960	Yeah.
2239040	2240960	Uh, then we'll talk a little bit about my gaming week.
2240960	2244160	First off, I want to make sure I plug, uh, the, the shirt that I'm wearing.
2244160	2245160	I'm sorry, podcast folks.
2245160	2248280	You can't see the shirt, but I am actually tonight on Twitch wearing,
2248480	2251360	uh, one of our new newer shirts in the, I shouldn't say new.
2251360	2253800	It's been there a couple of months, but newer shirts in the store.
2253840	2257120	Uh, the orange lounge radio shirt that is Sega inspired.
2257360	2258680	The dark Sakura put together.
2258680	2264200	So, um, I have this and I bought also the, um, the new VOG network logo, or I
2264200	2266440	shouldn't say new cause it's not going to replace this, but like that, that
2266600	2270280	eighties esque, uh, the jet set radio looking, I'm going to call it that the
2270280	2272440	jet set radio looking VOG network logo.
2272640	2273520	I got that too.
2273520	2275840	And both I, I got to wear to dragon con.
2276040	2280000	If you want to check out the shirt, um, all you have to do is head over to
2280000	2282440	our store of vognetwork.com slash shop.
2282920	2287960	Um, As far as my gaming week, um, thank you for linking that in chat, by the
2287960	2291440	way, uh, and pixel pocket says I have the Sega styled OLR shirt as a tank.
2291480	2292200	Oh, that's awesome.
2292200	2295960	I wish I had the body for a tank top, but I don't, uh, maybe someday.
2296240	2297600	Um, so you know what?
2297600	2299040	Everybody has a body for a tank.
2299120	2299560	Yes.
2299560	2299840	Yes.
2299840	2300240	That's true.
2300240	2304160	I shouldn't, but you know, I, I, I just prefer to have my
2304160	2305360	sleeves covered with this one.
2305480	2306520	I like the baseball Jersey.
2306520	2309080	Anyway, you don't get a lot of like baseball Jersey custom shirts.
2309200	2313000	So I kind of like the streamlabs apps that, um, Anyway, my game of the week,
2313040	2314720	I totally forgot about the warrior wear demo.
2314800	2319800	I forgot the Diablo to have that open beta and y'all know, I love Diablo.
2319800	2322960	Now granted all the other stuff that's been going on.
2323160	2325800	Maybe that's why it's been kind of out of my head, but I didn't even think
2325800	2329280	to try it, which by the way, just a reminder, uh, the blizzard employees
2329280	2333040	have still not been responded to on their, uh, call of action, what
2333040	2336800	they are looking at from, uh, their bosses and their, uh, higher ups.
2336800	2339160	Just, just a reminder that still is not resolved.
2339200	2342080	And I will be mentioning that every week here on this program.
2342160	2347880	Uh, as I remember to, um, until it is resolved actually, um, As far as other
2347880	2352400	games I've been playing this week, um, I was continuing on in Hades.
2352840	2358880	Uh, I actually finally beat Hades, so I got the boss down, but here's the thing.
2358880	2364440	Once you beat Hades, the game has just begun because there is, there's
2364440	2366280	much more behind the curve, but I love that game.
2366280	2367080	It's so good.
2367320	2370480	Um, but it is, you know, the thing that gets really frustrating about
2370480	2374320	it is that even though, yes, the builds are really cool, how like you kind
2374320	2375560	of have to make new ones every time.
2375840	2378800	I really wish there was something that would let me rerun a particular build.
2378800	2381360	I just had like a, like a limited use item or something.
2381360	2384480	It would just be, it'd just be really nice, uh, to be able to do that.
2384760	2385920	Um, but I still love Hades.
2386160	2389400	Also been playing Final Fantasy 14 by daylight.
2389760	2394480	Um, not a lot of new stuff, although I did play a little bit of Haven, which
2394480	2396240	was a game that was on Xbox game pass.
2396280	2398360	Um, and that was a very stylish kind of game.
2398520	2401000	I was doing that just to get an achievement for one of the,
2401000	2403320	um, uh, little Xbox reward things.
2404240	2406680	Um, and then I was also trying to do it in grounded.
2406680	2409520	I actually probably played a little bit more grounded, you know, that game.
2409720	2410520	That's basically honey.
2410520	2412560	I shrunk the kids, the game, but they can't call it that.
2412880	2414720	Um, where you actually play as kids that are in the back.
2414760	2416960	I didn't realize it was such a crafting heavy game.
2417240	2419480	Like it almost feels a bit Minecrafty to me.
2419600	2421120	Like what that game is all about.
2421120	2423240	So, um, it was neat though.
2423320	2427840	Um, I enjoyed what I was playing that, but unfortunately, um, it was, um.
2429080	2431440	It was really hard to get the achievements in that game.
2431480	2434160	They, they didn't really have any gimmies off the bat.
2434160	2437160	So, uh, yeah, I had to, I had to just do something.
2437160	2439640	It was going to be a little bit easier and then yes.
2439680	2443240	Um, SSU 100 Mountain Chat says, I keep getting distracted.
2443240	2445200	Quake came out this week and I had to play that.
2445440	2448320	Bobby Buckle says, I got to play Diablo two, but quake just came out.
2448400	2449800	I mean, what is this 1999?
2449800	2450080	Yeah.
2450360	2453080	Um, I also played a lot of that quake remaster.
2453120	2456280	I'll, I'll sit on my thoughts until we get to that story later in the show.
2456280	2458600	Cause I know it's coming up, but I did spend a bit of time on that
2458600	2460040	Quaker master and I will say.
2460840	2465440	If you got quake for free when Bethesda net was giving it away.
2465440	2466040	Do you remember that?
2466040	2469480	It was about, um, probably about, or was it even last year's quake con?
2469680	2470560	It might've been a year now.
2470560	2471760	It might've been last year's quake con.
2471960	2474400	They were giving away quake one, two, and three for free.
2474400	2475720	If you pick that up, guess what?
2475720	2476600	You got a free upgrade.
2477480	2481320	So, uh, I hope you all pick that up cause, uh, it was
2481320	2482320	definitely worth it this week.
2482920	2486240	Um, also really quickly, before we get into gaming news, I do want to
2486240	2487680	talk about dragon con a little bit.
2487680	2492560	So I'm going to be going to, um, dragon con on, uh, September.
2492600	2494680	I would say September 1st, but that's the day I fly out there.
2494680	2497520	The con itself starts the second and then runs through labor day.
2497720	2498120	Yes.
2498120	2499160	It's going to be a weird year.
2499160	2499440	Yes.
2499440	2501520	The Delta variant is very real and all this stuff.
2501640	2505160	Um, but I'm very happy that dragon con is taking a lot of precautions with it.
2505160	2507040	So masking is going to be mandatory, of course.
2507280	2508640	And they just announced this week.
2508680	2514600	You have to, they, they will be checking for vaccination or recent, like, uh, COVID
2514600	2516320	tests that is not like an over the cat.
2516320	2517920	There's very all sorts of parameters with it.
2518120	2521960	So basically, um, confirmation that you really don't have COVID.
2522240	2524960	Um, so I'm very happy for that.
2524960	2527120	So, uh, it's going to be half the attendance though.
2527400	2529600	Um, so I understand there's probably a lot of people who might sit
2529600	2530640	out this year and that's fine.
2530680	2531880	But if you are going to go.
2533080	2535000	I can finally tell you about the panels I'm going to be on.
2535040	2537680	I said, I wasn't going to announce them until they were in the Apple.
2537680	2538240	Guess what?
2538440	2541440	The app came out this week and all of my panels are in there.
2541440	2543360	So I'm going to quickly tell you what I'm doing at dragon con.
2543560	2546400	And I will also tell you which ones are streaming live.
2546720	2549880	Um, because for those that don't want to go, um, because of everything going
2549880	2552800	on in the world, um, you can still catch a lot of them live.
2553160	2559240	So, uh, first panel Friday, 1130 AM, these are all Eastern time video
2559600	2563480	didn't kill the radio star tips for doing an audio podcast on video
2563480	2564640	that will be streaming live.
2564920	2568120	Um, that's a panel Bobby and I pitched a couple of years ago that we've
2568120	2571640	done a few times now because we have this experience of taking this long
2571640	2573960	running audio show and moving it to Twitch.
2574240	2577280	And we kind of want to talk to other people that, um, are maybe looking
2577280	2581200	at doing something similar where they've been doing, uh, a lot of, uh,
2581240	2583960	audio stuff and they're going to make the move to video and we kind of
2583960	2586000	talk about some of the things we've learned from it and some of the
2586000	2587360	things we think are best practices.
2587600	2590840	Uh, yeah, and Bobby points out in chat, this is technically the VOG panel,
2590920	2591920	but we have guests on it.
2591920	2597080	It's not just Bobby and I, uh, I love this Friday at 1 PM on digital media.
2597080	2598400	This will also be streamed live.
2598560	2601600	I'm going to be on a panel called neighborhoods over numbers.
2601920	2605760	These are people that enjoy broadcasting because of the communities
2605760	2608880	and the people they meet and they don't care about numbers so much.
2609320	2612600	If ever there was a panel meant for me, and this wasn't even my pitch,
2612600	2613960	I don't think, was it Bobby?
2614480	2617080	I don't even remember which fucking panels we pitched.
2617400	2618440	I don't think we pitched this.
2618440	2619280	I think somebody else did.
2619280	2621240	And I was like, Oh, I wish I had thought of that.
2621240	2622280	I should be on that panel.
2622480	2625480	So, um, neighborhoods over numbers, that's Friday at one o'clock.
2625920	2632600	Um, then over on the gaming track Friday at two 30 head canons, welcome
2632720	2635720	how games create personalized stories.
2636120	2640440	And I thought, Oh gosh, I get into Loki and Jamie's head
2640440	2642360	cannon so much here on this program.
2642360	2644440	This would be a great panel for me to moderate.
2644680	2648440	So we're going to do a panel on head cannons and, uh, the personalized
2648440	2649520	stories you take away from the game.
2649720	2652040	And I think a lot of the recent dead by daylight combo is really going to
2652040	2654120	kind of help in that particular arena.
2654720	2658000	Um, the pros and cons about being on a network.
2658040	2660440	Uh, this is a very, they've done this on the digital media track.
2660440	2663800	A lot of times it's just about, should you network up with other
2663880	2667880	shows or, or, you know, other, um, you know, existing podcast networks or not.
2668080	2669960	So that'll be Friday at four o'clock.
2670000	2672120	I have a very, that's my fourth panel on Friday.
2672600	2673600	And, um, that's it.
2673640	2678080	I have four panels on Friday alone then on Sunday.
2678280	2680040	So I guess I have Saturday off.
2680040	2682400	I just realized I don't have a single panel on Saturday.
2682400	2682920	I really don't.
2682920	2683320	All right.
2683680	2687640	On Sunday, I have a panel called from inception to posting.
2687840	2689240	Let's get you published.
2689520	2693200	And this one is about, um, just the basic steps for how to
2693200	2694120	get your content out there.
2694520	2697880	So, um, I, I know a little bit about that, so we'll talk about that.
2698040	2699560	That is also going to be streaming live.
2699880	2702720	And then I have another panel called gender unlocked
2703000	2704920	character creation for everyone.
2705120	2711320	So that is Sunday at four o'clock where, uh, we'll talk about, uh, the character
2711320	2716240	creators with, uh, expanded gender expression and what games have done this
2716240	2717680	well and what games have missed the mark.
2717960	2720120	Now, Bobby, you're going to get a kick out of this.
2720640	2723880	Do you remember how you were saying you lost a panel?
2724640	2727720	I think I did too, because it's no longer in the app.
2728320	2731000	So unfortunately it looks like, ah, that's a bummer.
2731000	2733720	I was really looking forward to that one too, but unfortunately it's
2733720	2735080	no longer showing in the app.
2735080	2737280	So I guess I can't tell you about it.
2737400	2738160	Do you want to hear about it?
2738160	2738960	You want to know what the panel was?
2738960	2739840	I was really excited to do that.
2739840	2740080	Okay.
2740080	2740520	I'm gonna tell you.
2741280	2744160	So I was supposed to be doing, it's not, I maybe, maybe it's just.
2746480	2746760	Yeah.
2746760	2748000	May I, it's not there.
2748000	2751160	So I'm left to assume it is canceled at this point, but if it comes back,
2751160	2756120	I'll let you know, um, it was going to be a ZeniMax panel and it was the art of
2756120	2762160	ZeniMax, ZeniMax, of course, being the company behind, um, Skyrim, Fallout.
2762640	2763920	I was going to be one of the artists.
2763920	2766800	So I imagine that artist probably pulled out of the show, unfortunately.
2767040	2767560	But I get it.
2767720	2768440	It is what it is.
2768880	2770080	Uh, oh man.
2770080	2772120	I was looking forward to that one, but yeah, that was, that was probably
2772120	2774240	going to be my biggest, my biggest panel.
2774520	2775040	That's all right.
2775320	2775520	Yeah.
2775520	2776000	Too bad.
2777120	2777880	But I understand.
2777880	2781440	So, so Bobby, it wasn't just you that, uh, lost a panel.
2783560	2784160	It happens.
2784200	2784560	It happens.
2784600	2785000	All right.
2785480	2789080	Uh, but that's my lineup for, so six panels at Dragon Con that I'm going
2789080	2790800	to be doing, uh, but I'm really excited.
2790800	2795360	And you know, with these, uh, celebrities that are dropping out and things
2795360	2798760	changing around a little bit, I imagine there will be a panel that shows up
2798760	2802720	that I don't know about, so we'll, uh, get to that, uh, I'll let you know
2802720	2803880	as soon as I know more about that.
2804200	2804600	All right.
2804920	2808400	Uh, let's move on and get into some gaming news and stuff that's going
2808400	2810200	around on around the gaming world.
2810240	2812000	So Loki, we'll start with you.
2812000	2813720	Cause I know you're excited about this.
2814040	2815720	I am very excited.
2815720	2822880	So yes, us, the, uh, saints row, uh, social media team has been teasing
2823200	2825200	an announcement coming this week.
2825280	2831600	Um, so they put out a, just a, a piece of graffiti show and Waltz does
2831600	2836200	rebooting and basically saying that saints row is being rebooted.
2836560	2838440	Uh, we're going to find out about it.
2838600	2844200	Thanks to Jeff Keeley's opening night games, calm show, uh, which is going to
2844200	2850200	be coming out, I think Wednesday, if I remember correctly, Wednesday at 11 AM,
2850560	2857080	uh, Pacific time, 2 PM Eastern time, uh, August 25th, so definitely
2857080	2858720	going to be tuning into that.
2858800	2861560	I am super excited to see what's coming.
2861800	2863680	I don't care if it's garbage.
2864720	2868040	A little bit care that if it's garbage, I don't want it to be like, you know,
2868040	2873320	agents of mayhem garbage, but it's pretty hard to, you know, not
2873320	2876000	give me the buy that game day one.
2876280	2878560	Now that said, if it sucks, sure.
2878560	2881480	I'll complain about it, but I'm still going to buy it day one.
2881480	2884080	And I mean, so absolutely.
2884080	2884920	We'll be picking this up.
2884920	2886000	I picked up all the other ones.
2886000	2886480	Why not?
2886720	2890640	Um, so yeah, that, that is something that's coming and hopefully we get
2890640	2892200	some announcements of remasters as well.
2892200	2894360	I know three was remastered while ago.
2894760	2898480	Two was being kind of worked on by one person.
2898560	2902160	Um, I think it was the idle ninja still working on that.
2902560	2907320	Um, so I don't know if that's ever going to be remastered or, you know,
2907320	2910640	I think he was porting over stuff or like fixing some bugs and stuff.
2910640	2914920	Cause they finally got the source code back, but yeah, I I'm, I'm down.
2915120	2920720	I just hope it's as crazy as three, not as crazy as four, four little too goofy.
2921280	2924280	Also too derivative of like the goddamn matrix.
2924280	2925960	Like, yeah, I get it.
2925960	2929640	Matrix is cool and all, but like, do we really need to do matrix
2929640	2931720	references this late in the game?
2931840	2932880	Um, please don't.
2933320	2935680	So I am curious to see what they do with that.
2935680	2940880	Cause honestly, like, I don't know, the grand theft auto, like I just can't go
2940880	2942320	in the grand theft auto online anymore.
2942320	2944800	It's just like, not for me anymore.
2945560	2946800	I don't know what happened to that.
2946800	2947280	Serious.
2947280	2948800	Mike Defton chat says, I don't know.
2948800	2949560	What's more funny.
2949560	2952680	Loki's cam doing the thing it does, or Rob trying to contain his laughter.
2952680	2957320	I can't help it when Loki's camera does that camera one, camera two, camera one.
2957800	2961800	It's just really funny to me, especially because this is such a big story.
2961800	2963840	I know he's really excited about that.
2963920	2967560	His computer's just deciding to go, did you mean to use this camera instead?
2968560	2969640	It's like, we get the distance.
2970360	2971640	I think it's the software.
2971640	2975240	It's just this X split V cam software keeps switching it.
2975240	2979160	Like it loses connection to the, to the camera, which obviously it's.
2980520	2984920	It works all the other times when I'm doing stuff, but for some reason
2984920	2986880	it's like, yeah, can't do it.
2987440	2988040	I love that.
2988120	2988560	All right.
2988960	2989360	Whatever.
2989680	2990120	Anyway.
2990160	2994520	Uh, so what do you think it's going to be like a redoing of one of the games?
2994560	2997760	Or do you think it's like a reboot for the whole franchise in general?
2997800	3002600	So technically it could still be sort of in Canon because, so.
3003240	3007120	Get out of hell, which was the last Saints Row game that they put out, which
3007120	3012080	is basically just kind of taking the Saints Row three or four engine again,
3012080	3014520	and doing yet another game with that.
3014560	3018320	Again, it's basically the same sort of game play.
3018440	3018880	Oh yeah.
3018880	3021720	The hell had like three different endings that you could pick from.
3021720	3024880	One of them was like rebooting the whole franchise.
3024920	3028320	Like one of them actually had them as cops, which is weird, but, um,
3028360	3030160	hold up, hold up, hold up.
3030200	3033640	So they had an ending where you chose basically one of three paths and that
3033640	3035840	would like, so it's a rift on mass effect.
3038080	3038560	I think.
3038600	3038960	Yes.
3039000	3039320	Okay.
3039360	3043080	They're not fully the, the later games weren't full of original ideas.
3043080	3048280	Unfortunately, um, no, that's like some of the other games were like, they
3048280	3052280	started off like Saints Row was kind of like, I don't know if it was
3052280	3053920	trying to take itself seriously.
3054440	3058200	The first one took itself somewhat seriously and they did
3058200	3060040	like some goofy stuff in there.
3060360	3064360	Um, but still we're going for like a grand theft auto vibe, which is totally fine.
3064360	3068200	The two went a little bit more crazy and then they kind of did
3068200	3069400	their own unique things with it.
3069400	3073080	Like for example, they had like some mini games that were kind of unique,
3073080	3076760	like septic Avenger, where you sprayed poop on things that was hilarious.
3077120	3082440	Um, like the, the, uh, insurance fraud is always fun, you know, jumping
3082440	3085560	in front of cars, ragdolling and stuff like that, like that, that's fun.
3085960	3090000	And they even have like some fun, unique multiplayer, uh,
3090120	3091720	components to the game as well.
3092720	3097520	It was like the first game to have co-op gameplay throughout the storyline.
3097840	3101880	Like you couldn't do that in grand theft auto four, you could play the whole
3101880	3104400	storyline co-op and that's pretty awesome.
3104880	3108960	Um, it also supported system link, which back in the day, like when you're doing
3108960	3113680	land stuff, like that was absolutely fantastic grand theft auto four didn't
3113680	3117520	support that and you can't even play through the storyline co-op now in
3117520	3120760	grand theft auto five, I mean, granted now they have their own storyline and,
3120800	3124720	and grand theft auto online, but like you, it's still not something you could have
3124720	3129840	done and then three and four just kind of regurgitated the same stuff over and
3129840	3134880	over again, like they just basically took the same missions, didn't even really like
3134880	3139120	kind of get creative with the mini games so much, it was just like kind of, Ooh,
3139120	3140520	we're ripping off Tron now.
3140520	3142120	Ooh, we're ripping off the matrix.
3142120	3143600	Ooh, we're ripping off mass effect.
3143600	3148640	Like you could do a little bit, some nods and stuff and make it funny, but like,
3149040	3152960	come on, like, I don't know, you can do way better than that.
3153320	3156480	And so it just felt like kind of a rush job with some of these things.
3156520	3160840	And I know that saints are a four wasn't supposed to be like the way it is.
3160840	3162520	They had like the whole dominatrix thing.
3162520	3167560	And then I think they even did like deleted like DLCs type stuff with it as
3167560	3172520	well, but it was kind of a mess to be, to be honest, but like, I am very curious
3172520	3176080	to see what a modern day saints road would look like in a modern day engine
3176080	3178280	on next gen, you know, current gen.
3178760	3180040	Um, systems and stuff.
3180040	3181800	I really want to see what it looks like.
3181800	3184400	Cause it's been a long time since we had a saints road game.
3184400	3186120	It has been a little bit of the remasters.
3186200	3186680	Yeah.
3187080	3188240	Been a very long time.
3188240	3191360	So, um, I'm very excited.
3191400	3191600	Yeah.
3191600	3192920	I, I really can't wait.
3193560	3194000	All right.
3194480	3195160	Well, we'll see.
3195160	3199160	I just, just think next episode of OLR, we have a new saints road
3199160	3200200	game to talk about Loki.
3200200	3202920	So we'll get all the details of games com be good.
3203000	3206040	Especially if they do like a trailer in the trailer.
3206200	3206680	Oh God.
3206680	3208400	I hope they do a really good trailer for it.
3208400	3211760	Like they do a three with like a power in the background.
3211840	3214320	Oh, just chef's kiss.
3214320	3215280	Like perfect.
3215320	3215840	That was great.
3215840	3217560	And even the mission that was perfect.
3217720	3220520	Like, so saints road three gets so much stuff, right?
3220640	3223720	But then they just like, there's also a lot of stuff that they get wrong with that.
3223720	3226520	And I look, let's focus on what they do.
3226520	3226840	Right.
3226880	3227960	Let's let's go that way.
3227960	3228400	All right.
3229640	3230080	All right.
3230280	3233600	Let's move on and talk about another series that gets people really amped up.
3233640	3234600	That's Pokemon.
3235080	3239440	Pokemon had a, a kind of a special little direct of their own this week.
3239440	3242840	And we got some updates on brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.
3243320	3245920	We got to see a little bit more of what those games look like.
3245960	3249040	In fact, we also learned a little bit more about the grand underground.
3249040	3252160	So it almost sounds like there's kind of like a, it kind of since things
3252160	3255160	that sound a little bit like the wild area from the newer Pokemon games, but
3255160	3258000	kind of like this underground area in these games, that could be very interesting.
3258760	3263440	Also the super contest will come back as super contest shows and you can
3263440	3266360	socialize with other trainers in the union room and you get to
3266360	3269200	personalize your capsule decoration.
3269200	3269600	So.
3270320	3272080	Some of the features that'll be coming to that game.
3272280	3276920	Also Pokemon home compatibility, which isn't surprising, but that'll come in 2022.
3277320	3282160	Also a very special Nintendo switch light, Dialga and Palkia.
3282440	3286080	Those special editions will be coming on Friday, November 5th.
3287480	3292920	And yes, I saw that as Mike Deaf points out in chat, Pokemon contests equal
3292920	3294200	Pokemon rhythm game.
3294360	3294760	Yeah.
3294760	3297720	That's, uh, that's what I've, uh, I've heard.
3298080	3300560	Um, so I'm interested in that and checking that out.
3300560	3303880	I'm actually, I feel like I'm more excited about these than Shane is.
3303880	3307360	Cause I don't think Shane's a huge fan of gen four, uh, and he wasn't
3307400	3310760	really big on the reboot, uh, the early stuff, I think he was a little
3310760	3314000	more on board with the, uh, that was the impression I got from him after
3314000	3317080	this direct, but I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm gonna play it.
3317080	3318520	I'm gonna buy these games, bring them on.
3319320	3323600	Uh, now a game that I know Shane is very excited about, and I'm excited
3323600	3327880	about this one too, is Pokemon Legends Arceus, uh, and this is one where
3327880	3330920	it's also in the Sinnoh region, but it's way in the past, it's not
3330920	3333560	connected directly to any of the games.
3333840	3336840	Uh, and it has that mixed starter base, right?
3336840	3340640	Where you can, uh, be Rowlet, Cyndaquil or Oshawott, uh, which is
3340640	3342840	kind of neat that it mixes up the gens.
3342840	3346720	And we found out in this presentation, there are kind of some new Pokemon
3346720	3350480	in like that whole, you know how they do, like, there were Alolan
3350480	3352600	Pokemon and Galar Pokemon.
3352600	3355400	Well, now there's going to be, um, Suian.
3355440	3359040	Uh, so like Braver, Bravery, Braviary, uh, has one.
3359200	3361480	Growlithe has a very unique looking one too.
3361480	3364800	So there's going to be some newish Pokemon in this as well.
3365120	3368280	And then the other big announcement, uh, during the, uh, Pokemon direct
3368280	3370720	was that Pokemon Unite will come out.
3370720	3374280	Their MOBA will come out on mobile phones September 22nd.
3374720	3375840	So enjoy that.
3376160	3378680	And, uh, I guess there's some other little things too, if you want to
3378680	3383080	talk about Pokemon Go and how weird it is that Gen 8 Pokemon are suddenly
3383080	3386800	in the game when we did, we just skipped Gen 7 and went right to Gen 8.
3387280	3388320	Um, okay.
3390120	3392240	So, but not the starters, not the starters.
3392240	3395920	I guess, I guess it's not legit until the starters are there, but, uh, still,
3395920	3398080	it's still a little weird in that game right now, but okay.
3398600	3400240	Um, but there you go.
3400240	3401680	That was the Pokemon announcements.
3401760	3408040	So, uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog and network, um, E3 VL and
3408040	3413040	chat says disappointed it's the light edition and not regular switch or switch.
3413040	3413920	Oh, led.
3413920	3416000	Oh, good observation that it's not the switch.
3416000	3416640	Oh, led.
3416640	3417920	I didn't even think of that, but yeah.
3418120	3420440	So it's going to be a little bit of the older ones.
3420480	3422880	So that's, um, that's too bad.
3423880	3424400	All right.
3424800	3429040	Speaking of the switch, I was going to say like our switch is having issues now.
3429040	3432760	My, my doc, my, I had it, so I bought two docs.
3432760	3434000	I had a doc that came with it.
3434000	3437600	I bought another doc cause they originally I was playing on the switch
3437640	3442080	near my PC to stream from it or whatever to like do gameplay capture.
3442080	3443240	So I want a doc for that.
3443800	3445520	So I had a spare just sitting around.
3445520	3447680	So the first doc stopped charging the switch.
3448440	3449760	I put the second doc down.
3449800	3454320	Now it's starting to like the power light, certain of flash on it too.
3454320	3455680	So it's dying as well.
3455680	3459040	It's like, I don't know what it is when Nintendo hardware, at least
3459040	3463080	in this, the switch generation, but it's not to the standard that previous
3463080	3464560	generations have been, that's for sure.
3464800	3466880	Mine spin just normal.
3466880	3467800	I don't have that problem.
3467800	3468240	That's weird.
3468240	3471560	But I always, my switch is also also almost always sitting in that doc.
3471560	3472520	So interesting.
3473200	3473520	Yeah.
3473560	3476480	Me going to dragon con will be the first time in a while that that thing
3476480	3478000	is out of the doc for like a week.
3478360	3479720	So it's interesting.
3480560	3481080	All right.
3481400	3483640	Well, moving on, keep mine docs all the time.
3483640	3487760	So I, I, yeah, I'd say like 99% of the time my, uh, switch is docked.
3487760	3490600	So I'm, I'm kind of shocked to hear that this is something that can happen.
3490600	3493720	I can't imagine what would, what would happen if the doc stopped working?
3493720	3494680	I'd be so mad.
3495240	3495680	All right.
3496400	3498800	Uh, moving on dark soccer, you have something for us.
3499480	3499960	I do.
3499960	3502200	And by the way, I forgot to mention something about this wig.
3503000	3504480	This is for my Legion cosplay.
3505160	3505800	Oh, random.
3505800	3506000	Okay.
3506000	3506560	I didn't know that.
3506880	3507200	Yeah.
3507200	3511840	I'm going to be doing, uh, one of the Julie cosmetics.
3511840	3518720	So I've got the white mask on order and you know, anyway, so yeah, neat preview.
3519480	3520080	Anyway.
3520120	3526840	Um, uh, I, I almost hate saying the company's name because it just
3526840	3528880	leaves this bad taste in my mouth.
3528880	3538480	It's it's, uh, but Activision is going to be omitting its logo from, uh, well,
3538480	3539560	actually it already did it.
3539560	3545040	It left their logo out of a call of duty trailer and said it was a creative choice.
3545960	3553720	And I mean, it's almost a, a full omission of any reference to
3553720	3556120	Activision as being any part of it.
3556880	3563640	Um, it said it opened with call of duty presents instead of Activision presents.
3563680	3565920	No logo, nothing.
3565920	3570720	Um, the only mention of Activision is this is in the small print
3571080	3573200	that, but this actually legally required.
3573760	3580680	So, um, it also omitted its logo from the call of duty Vanguard pre-order page.
3581160	3585960	Um, and there was a request for comment that was put forward and all they
3585960	3588440	said was that it was a creative choice.
3589080	3592040	But I mean, really, we know what this shit's about.
3592120	3594680	We know exactly what this shit is about.
3596200	3599480	They're in the, trying to distance from the, uh, uh, stuff
3599480	3601320	that's in the media right now.
3602160	3603080	And you know what?
3603320	3604360	It's not going to work.
3604400	3608360	Everyone knows that Activision is behind call of duty.
3608880	3612040	Every Activision studio, literally every Activision
3612040	3613480	studio is behind call of duty.
3614360	3615080	Exactly.
3615560	3619280	So, I mean, they made their bed time to light.
3619320	3623520	Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says most casuals don't, well, we're here to educate.
3624080	3626720	Did you know Activision makes call of duty and it's that same company
3626720	3627680	that's all in the news right now.
3628360	3629880	So, all right.
3630760	3634600	Uh, let's move on to another big game doing interesting things.
3634600	3634920	Loki.
3634920	3635280	I don't know.
3635280	3638120	I don't think you're giving people enough credit, you know?
3640400	3640840	All right.
3641160	3641560	Loki.
3642440	3642800	Yeah.
3643280	3646000	So Epic Games is a big game.
3646000	3646360	Loki.
3647280	3647640	Yeah.
3648120	3653680	So Epic Games has announced their totally original brand new, um, game mode that's
3653680	3655920	coming to the Fortnite called imposters.
3656360	3660680	Uh, it's a 10 player, uh, mode where you, I know this is going
3660680	3662240	to sound completely unique.
3662440	3667400	Um, you are trying to attempt who is trying to sabotage your
3667400	3670280	team and vote the imposters out.
3672200	3674720	Yeah, they ripped off, uh, among us.
3674960	3678040	Well, what about those who would say that among us wasn't technically
3678040	3681280	exactly an original idea, but I would, I would say it kind of goes back.
3681280	3684360	Like, I almost feel like the thing that among us is based on is basically
3684360	3685640	public domain at this point.
3685680	3689640	Like it's one of those things where the, and I, I completely understand
3689640	3692960	there are technically like books and card decks and stuff for the
3692960	3695280	werewolf game, the mafia game.
3695480	3701160	But the fact that like, there are so many variations of this same, you know, imposter
3701160	3705680	vote them out type of game, um, I think just goes to show that, that, you know,
3705680	3711040	that format is everywhere in many, many different forms, but I think the way
3711040	3712600	that Epic has kind of implemented this.
3712600	3714680	A lot of people are noting is, is pretty shameless.
3714680	3721520	Like it is, it's, it's much more adjacent to among us than a simple imposter
3721520	3723800	clone game ought to be, if that makes sense.
3723960	3730160	It's very, it's very much like a quick kind of copy, you know, copy paste of it.
3730640	3731080	Sure.
3731080	3738160	It's in the, you know, aesthetics of, you know, Fortnite, but like, I mean,
3738160	3741520	even like look at Fortnite, Fortnite's derivative as well of like, you know,
3741520	3745000	the battle royale games, you know, basically just totally looked like,
3745000	3746400	you know, player unknown was doing.
3746440	3748680	Um, I don't know.
3748720	3751640	Like, I think it's just really, really shitty.
3751720	3757360	I'm considering that, you know, the one, of course, everyone wanted to know, well,
3757400	3759520	what do the developers of among us think?
3759600	3762160	And they basically said, listen, we didn't patent the mechanic.
3762680	3765080	Um, they don't think it leads to a healthy game industry.
3765080	3768880	Is it really hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?
3769480	3770080	So like,
3771400	3776840	So they didn't say we think it's shit, but they kind of alluded to it.
3776840	3777600	Well, I'm sorry.
3777600	3781360	This, this is somebody else coming in on, so Innersloth, yeah, they basically said,
3781360	3787240	you know, that they, you know, patent to those mechanics, but like, yeah,
3787360	3788440	there's other people.
3788480	3794520	Um, yeah, so basically that was a comment by the Marcus Bromander,
3794520	3797080	who was the co-founder of Innersloth.
3797600	3800720	Um, but yeah, I agree.
3800800	3804200	I think it is kind of dumb.
3804240	3810440	Also the map that they have in the game is very similar to the among us,
3810480	3812600	like the standard map in among us as well.
3812600	3814680	So it's like, come on you guys.
3814680	3818640	Like, can you make it a little less like that?
3818680	3820240	I mean, you're a big company.
3820240	3825640	It's like, can't you be satisfied with the money that you're making as it is with Fortnite?
3825680	3828360	Do you really need to go start knocking off other games?
3828760	3831840	Well, I guess they're kind of a little late to the party.
3831840	3835280	I feel like, I feel like among us kind of already peaked and no disrespect to those
3835280	3840080	developers who've had huge success and you know, all the deserved awards and recognition
3840080	3843320	stuff, but I also kind of feel like among us in pop culture kind of already peaked.
3843720	3846480	So I kind of feel like Epic is late to the party with this.
3847000	3849440	And quite frankly, they deserve it.
3849440	3850480	I just don't think it's going to take off, honestly.
3850480	3852840	Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't think it's going to take off very well.
3852840	3854520	I think people will see it for what it is.
3854520	3859240	Yeah, um, no, Ariana Grande was much more impactful to Epic than this will be.
3859520	3861680	Yeah, I think that that's something more interesting.
3861680	3863360	That's something unique that they're doing.
3863360	3869000	Yeah, but it's like, oh, hey, we're going to rip off, you know, someone's game mode or whatever.
3870320	3870960	That's fine.
3871000	3875280	You can you can do like the whole thing, because like hell, I mean, even when we were playing like
3875280	3879840	Q's are laser tag and stuff, they had a mode called spy that you had to figure out, you know,
3879840	3882720	who was the spy didn't vote anybody out or anything like that.
3882720	3884360	But it's it's similar to that.
3884360	3890480	They could have taken like the espionage type of thing and done something unique with it.
3890480	3895640	But instead, what they do, they just, hey, let's copy it among us and let's let's make it as
3896160	3898360	let's make it legally distinct.
3898560	3906480	Basically, as as as little as we need to do to make it distinct from among us, but keep it as close as possible.
3908120	3909520	I mean, let's let's have them.
3909520	3910000	Why not?
3910280	3915720	Hey, you know, why not at this point, let's just have them rip off like, you know, other games as well.
3916440	3918680	Where's our fall guys?
3918880	3923800	You know, where's the obstacle course things for, you know, Fortnite?
3924600	3925080	Why not?
3925080	3930280	Let's jump on that bandwagon to going to chat E3 VL and chat says it's like fappy birds.
3930280	3932280	I think you meant to say flappy birds, but we'll go with it.
3933640	3936720	Where is the fappy bird mode in Fortnite?
3936720	3937760	I think it's a good question.
3937760	3940040	I guess I guess that kind of came and went.
3941120	3945560	SSU 100 Matt in chat says the among us team is kind of that little engine that did.
3945680	3948920	And this stings a little more that a big company is copying them.
3949120	3951440	Also, the among us team is cute and super humble.
3951440	3952880	Yeah. And I think that's exactly that.
3952880	3967600	I think that's why a lot of people are coming to the table kind of basically going like, yo, fuck Epic in this story, especially when, you know, Tim Sweeney tries and fails time and time again to bring this BDE to the table that he just doesn't have, you know, when it comes to.
3967600	3991600	But Epic's the little guy taking on these other companies and it's like, you it almost kind of like, really, it really looks bad in the scope of like him trying to do that parody ad with Big Brother and all that stuff about we're taking on the big mean companies when it's like, the fuck are you doing to Inner Sloth right now, Tim Sweeney and company?
3992000	3996200	Like, I think that's why there's a lot of people in this scenario that it's like, it's very transparent what Epic is doing.
3996600	4002640	It's very shitty and fuck them with something hard and sandpapery, like, especially Tim Sweeney.
4003360	4007280	I loved ZZT, but, um, you know what?
4007280	4008120	That was a long time ago.
4009400	4010440	It was a long, long time ago.
4011360	4012480	You were a different person.
4012480	4013520	I was a different person.
4013520	4014360	You've changed.
4015800	4017400	Uh, what's that?
4018040	4019360	I said, oh, Rob.
4019360	4019840	Oh, me.
4020280	4023120	Uh, E3VL says Sony tried to copy Smash.
4023120	4024280	Didn't turn out that well.
4024400	4027120	Actually, some people really defend the shit out of that game.
4027120	4027720	And I get it.
4027840	4028400	I do.
4028920	4032600	Um, Tiger Claw in chat says, if you want a good game, you might as well copy from the best.
4032600	4033200	Am I right?
4033520	4035680	Um, that isn't instantly going to make it good though.
4035680	4039800	I mean, I get where your like tongue and cheek comment comes from, but like that isn't going to make it good.
4040120	4048840	But when games are a little bit derivative, um, some, and kind of do their own thing with it and bring new things to the table, I think they do very well.
4048880	4054880	For example, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do something real close to home for Tiger Claw because I know where his fandoms lie.
4055200	4058200	So let's talk about the Ninja Turtle arcade game by, by Konami.
4058360	4059840	Now that game is an excellent game.
4059880	4060680	Don't get me wrong.
4060880	4062280	And why is that an excellent game?
4062280	4069480	Because it took something like what you would see in a game like Final Fight by Capcom, which was huge in the genre at the time.
4069520	4072280	But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles did its own thing.
4072440	4076080	And it was that whole fact that you had the four characters that were all very distinctive.
4076240	4084120	And who remembers when you were knocking shit at the screen and how like the, the enemies would hit the screen and there was like the item use it.
4084120	4084880	But let's be real.
4084880	4087960	The format is very similar to Final Fight and other games before it.
4088000	4091640	I mean, Golden Axe, if you want, it was kind of a very similar type of thing.
4092080	4100640	So sometimes you take a template from the best, but you improve on it in your own way.
4101520	4107880	And that's why something like that is successful and where Fortnite could have been maybe a little more successful.
4107880	4113280	But again, I think they kind of they kind of they kind of hit the genre after it after it passed.
4113680	4114400	Yeah. Yeah.
4114440	4118200	Tiger Claw brings up, to be fair, Final Fight wouldn't have been around if it wasn't for Double Dragon.
4118200	4119680	You're you know what? You're right on that.
4119680	4121640	I just happen to think of Final Fight first.
4121640	4123480	But you're right. Double Dragon did it before.
4123960	4127960	But there were, you know, was was Golden Axe before Double Dragon?
4128960	4130720	I can't remember.
4132120	4137840	But I know that that fighting genre has has evolved quite a ways, you know, over the years.
4138040	4142240	So Double Dragon was eighty seven.
4143280	4148680	OK, that probably was the first one then, because I think Golden Axe was eighty eight or eighty.
4148720	4151440	I could be wrong, though. Golden Axe was eighty nine.
4151640	4152400	Oh, wow. OK.
4153240	4159000	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, we'll see how this Nickelodeon smash like fighting game goes.
4159280	4162320	Folks are hyped about it, even though it's a copy of Smash with their IPs.
4162320	4167360	Well, the the question is, will they do something different with it beyond just the characters?
4167360	4171680	Obviously, will they be able to do something different with it?
4171680	4173680	And will Lori Beth Denberg be playable?
4173680	4179520	Yes or no? She better be the announcer, if nothing like if Lori Beth Denberg is not the announcer of this game, I reject it.
4179520	4185360	Anyway, or or what was her name on guts?
4186240	4188880	The referee, she had like a Moira Moira.
4188920	4190480	That's it. She had like a New Zealand accent.
4190480	4193440	Yes, Moira Moira could also be the announcer.
4193440	4195200	And I didn't think she was from New Zealand.
4195200	4196360	I think she was British.
4196360	4197720	I thought she had a maybe.
4197720	4201040	Oh, well, anyway, she was she definitely had an accent of some sort.
4201040	4203440	I remember that. So. All right.
4204000	4206000	Anyhow, let's Moira Quirk.
4206400	4208320	Where was she from? You got the Wiki up?
4209160	4211680	I'm looking. She's from London.
4211920	4213720	OK. All right. She's English.
4213720	4216200	You got me. All right.
4216200	4219480	DJ Rama S in chat says, have you been listening to Lori Beth's podcast?
4219480	4223320	No, I haven't. And you brought that up before and I need to get on that.
4223320	4226200	So I will correct that soon. My bad.
4227680	4234080	All right, moving on, let's talk about an interesting history making moment overseas.
4234680	4239000	The Nintendo Switch has swept Japan's game sales chart,
4239280	4243400	meaning every entry in the top five is from switch.
4243400	4247640	Actually, it's every entry in the top 10 is on this.
4247640	4252160	Actually, it's every entry in the top 30.
4252160	4255880	And that's where I'm going to end is a Nintendo switch up 30.
4256360	4260800	The top 30 games are all on the Nintendo Switch in Japan right now.
4261000	4263120	And that is up against the PlayStation five.
4263160	4266840	That is up against the Xbox, Xbox in Japan. Come on.
4267680	4271040	But that hasn't happened in 33 years.
4271040	4275000	The last time that supposedly happened, November 1988,
4275000	4277280	when the Famicom had the top 30 games.
4277560	4280880	Now, keep in mind, Japan is not the US.
4280880	4282360	So there are some differences.
4282520	4285760	I think it's interesting that Minecraft is the top game in Japan right now.
4285760	4287760	I mean, I get it, but it's it's interesting.
4288440	4292200	But other games in the list are things like Skyward Sword, Mario Kart eight,
4292200	4296080	Monster Hunter, Taiko no Tatsujin, Dragon Quest.
4296080	4299200	Those are all the types of games you're seeing in the top 30 in Japan right now.
4299640	4302640	Also, something that's been pointed out about Japan
4302640	4306280	is that they are really in the peak of the pandemic right now.
4307560	4310040	Whereas, you know, I think a lot of I mean, you know,
4310040	4313280	with Delta or whatever, some could argue we're in a peak of the pandemic.
4313280	4318160	But I think here in the US, you saw like peak pandemic culture shifts
4318320	4322320	in like March, April, May, when it was first happening last year.
4322520	4324960	And Japan's kind of going through that now.
4325480	4330080	So some are saying that that's why the switch possibly is seeing a resurgence
4330080	4333360	because of, you know, it's it's portability and, you know, all of that.
4333360	4335800	So I think it's interesting.
4335800	4339080	Also, I kind of just think with the PlayStation five
4339760	4341520	being, you know, somewhat the newer system,
4341520	4344440	but there's not a ton of games on it right now. Yes, there's some.
4344640	4347640	I can see where it's probably slipped out of the top 30 for the moment.
4347920	4350640	You know, because there's just not a new triple A title
4350640	4354080	to really sell in Japan right now. So.
4355120	4357000	Anyway, some comments in chat.
4357000	4361120	Mike Deft says Taiko should be top 30 in US as well.
4361320	4362720	Maybe someday. Maybe you got it.
4362720	4365000	You got to just buy a lot more copies.
4365000	4368040	Dartetsuya says, Oh, yeah, I hear Monster Hunter is huge over there.
4368040	4370880	Dragon Quest, probably even more so. Yes, to both those things.
4372080	4376040	Monster Quest and Dragon, Dragon, Dragon Hunter, Monster Quest, Dragon Hunter.
4376040	4379400	Sure, whatever. Those games are huge in Japan.
4380240	4384000	So. All right. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
4385480	4389800	Whale. So
4390720	4393840	for fans of NetherRealm's fighting games,
4393840	4398280	of which there are many because let's face it, their fighting games are good.
4398640	4404720	But they're giving the priority to Mortal Combat 12 over Injustice three.
4405440	4406600	And it makes sense.
4406600	4411800	You know, Mortal Combat is the bigger name, I reckon, when it comes to.
4413000	4419480	To IPs. And it really would make sense to me that they would do that.
4423520	4426040	They know that it's going to make money, first of all,
4426840	4431080	and they know that they don't need
4432000	4435560	to focus on DC characters
4435560	4440000	when they've got their own entire roster of characters
4440480	4443320	that they can make the money off of. Right.
4443880	4446560	I find the whole thing to be an injustice, quite frankly,
4446560	4450200	because I like that fighting series. Really? Yes, really.
4450480	4454600	I would like to see an Injustice three, but I get it.
4454600	4455760	What is this all rooted in?
4455760	4457000	Was there a tweet or something?
4457000	4460120	Because some folks in chat are lighting up like, why did they confirm it in a
4460960	4464640	yeah, there was a
4466080	4469440	a giant bomb video
4469440	4472480	that gives a lot of hints to
4473400	4475840	another round focusing more on Mortal Combat 12.
4479040	4483840	And also, I don't know, it just seems likely anyway,
4483840	4487800	but I thought it was worth mentioning just because this also then might
4487800	4491760	give a little bit of credence to them working on the next games.
4492840	4495120	Johnny Woofay in our chat over at twitch.tv
4495120	4499600	slash VOG Network has some things to say, including even if the story is true,
4499600	4503360	you won't see a mainline Mortal Combat announced for at least four years.
4503600	4507600	NRS or NetherRealm Studios is an active development of a new title right now,
4507600	4509240	whatever that may be.
4509240	4511840	Going on to say 11 can be fun in small bursts,
4511840	4515480	but I got burned out really fast on it.
4516280	4518600	And something new, it would be exciting, too.
4518640	4521760	How about not a fighting game?
4521760	4526040	How about a game that's nothing but sassing each other in those intro scenes?
4526080	4528600	I mean, don't get me wrong, because honestly, that's why I care about it.
4529000	4529680	Don't get me wrong.
4529680	4533120	I love the fighting games that they produce,
4533120	4535920	but I think it might be really fun to see them do something else.
4536120	4538720	It's kind of like we need.
4538960	4542560	We need a spinoff that's called Text from Cassie Cage.
4543440	4545720	Johnny Woofay says The Grid, too.
4545720	4548400	Fuck, yeah. Why not?
4549680	4551880	Were you laughing or coughing or both?
4551880	4553440	I was coughing.
4556440	4559320	Yeah, so I'm interested to see whatever they come up with next.
4559320	4562520	I also can understand that they probably would not want to bring out
4562520	4566520	a Mortal Combat 12, certainly not this year or next probably next year, even.
4566520	4571920	But I don't know if I would say four years in my crystal ball.
4571920	4576720	I would say maybe 2023 for Mortal Combat 12,
4577120	4581680	because that'll be about the time that PlayStation 5 and Xbox
4581680	4584280	Series X are not seen as like new anymore.
4584520	4586160	They're going to be like the standard.
4586160	4589960	And so I think Mortal Combat 12 is probably going to build to that standard.
4590160	4594080	And certainly the graphics and all that stuff are going to push to that level.
4594080	4596920	And I think the frames you get out of it are going to be very powerful.
4596920	4599880	Here's here's the other problem coming out of it, too.
4600200	4602440	And now just between the two games
4602680	4606360	and just as hadn't had a release since 2017, and I think it's due.
4607040	4610120	But there's also the crap going on with AT&T
4610800	4615800	because AT&T owns WB Games that owns NetherRealm.
4616720	4620680	And AT&T put up its games division last year,
4621280	4625360	like had bids from EA take to Microsoft Blizzard.
4626200	4627320	There was no deal.
4627320	4632920	But, you know, that's a lot of properties to go with it.
4633360	4636120	So who knows if they're going to make another bid at it?
4638040	4640000	I don't know what we're going to see.
4640000	4641600	Well, time will tell.
4641600	4646920	So but until then, we get rumors and lines to read in between.
4647280	4650080	And it isn't just a Fleetwood Mac album. That's right.
4650840	4653480	All right. Moving on, Logie.
4654480	4658600	Yeah, so we've kind of talked a little bit about Epic Store
4658600	4662760	adding some other like apps and stuff to the store.
4662800	4665480	Remember, there was a whole thing with itch.io and that kind of thing.
4665760	4669000	Well, now they're actually adding self-publishing.
4669200	4672840	So you're going to be able to actually publish games onto the Epic Store
4673240	4677360	similar to how you can on the Steam platform.
4678440	4681800	Of course, with that, they don't want any pornography or illegal content,
4681800	4683360	hateful discriminatory stuff.
4683360	4686480	IP infringing things, you know, the normal type of thing.
4686480	4688520	But right now it is in beta.
4688520	4691200	I'm not sure what it's going to take to necessarily publish
4691200	4694600	something on the platform, but it is interesting to see them open that up,
4694600	4697400	especially when I think they were talking about how their platform
4697400	4701000	is going to be more curated over Steam.
4701000	4705040	But now it's going to be the same.
4706040	4709320	So the same yet with less features.
4709320	4713760	Have you guys been using the Epic Store at all?
4713760	4717160	Like, I even forget to go in there and claim my free game anymore.
4717840	4720480	I try to remember to claim my free games, but that's about it.
4720960	4723200	I claimed Yooka-Laylee.
4723200	4724760	Oh, I see. I think I missed that one.
4724760	4727280	Damn it. I think it's still on.
4727600	4729360	Is it? We have it on so many platforms.
4729360	4732400	Like I have it on I have it on Steam. I have it on Twitch.
4732400	4734000	Yeah, I think it's on Game Pass.
4734000	4735920	Yeah. And Game Pass.
4735920	4737760	Yeah, I mean, so it's like.
4737760	4739280	I don't know. It's no big deal.
4739280	4741560	I will say I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,
4741560	4745760	but I was still using the Xbox cloud as a way to kind of like sample games
4745760	4746560	without downloading them.
4746560	4750600	That's actually how I played Haven and just giving props to the Xbox cloud.
4750600	4754760	Like I enjoy it, just being able to pick up all these different games
4754760	4755320	and just play them.
4755320	4757480	And I imagine for Jamie, it's a very similar thing with Stadia
4757480	4760200	and the games that they include in their their bundle.
4760200	4764400	Like I've been very skeptical of cloud gaming, but I
4764400	4768080	I'm starting to really see how that ease of really just bringing up a game
4768080	4772520	and jumping right into it is really nice, even if it isn't quite
4772520	4775360	the same graphical fidelity I would get if I'd install the game.
4775360	4779120	But it's it's neat to see that technology kind of progressing.
4780120	4781880	Again, I don't know how long I would use it.
4781880	4784600	I certainly wouldn't play a game like FOM has 14 that I've spent
4784600	4786200	hours and hours and hours on that way.
4786200	4789120	But to dip in a quick game for 30 minutes or an hour, it's
4789120	4791440	it's been kind of useful. So I'll give it that.
4793000	4796120	All right. Moving on, let's talk about oh, let's talk about a game
4796120	4799000	I'd rather just not have to download and just play it through the cloud,
4799000	4801600	to be honest, which I guess a lot of people did on Stadia
4802480	4806600	was Cyberpunk 2077, which just got a new patch.
4807560	4809120	This is the biggest patch to date.
4809120	4813200	They're saying it's the third major update since the original launch in December.
4813880	4816600	Remember, remember Cyberpunk, everybody?
4816960	4820440	Remember that game came out and it was it was it had some problems.
4821320	4825840	Special. Yeah. So 1.3 is the new version now.
4825840	4828040	They're talking about streaming and memory management.
4828240	4831040	And now they're going to deliver some more things in it.
4831040	4834280	So free DLC like cosmetic, cosmetic,
4834280	4837240	cosmetic, excuse me, additions are included in this as well.
4837440	4840960	There's also an alternative look for Johnny Silverhand, if you want that.
4841560	4845520	And then lots and lots and lots of bug fixes, gameplay, UI,
4845520	4848920	quests, things of that nature, being able to reset
4848920	4853040	and reallocate perk points from the skill trees, all of that is available.
4853720	4857800	Now, if you want to turn to other parts of the Internet and other people,
4858040	4861040	amateurs, if you will, but I don't even know if I would say they're amateurs
4861040	4863120	because a lot of these people do it very well.
4863120	4867320	Professional modders at work putting their own spin on the game.
4867520	4871960	And apparently there is a very well-known cyberpunk modder named Scissors
4872280	4874760	one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one.
4874760	4876880	I love that name. Just so we're clear.
4878440	4881200	They released a gameplay rebalance mega mod.
4881200	4883320	It's available on Nexus mods.
4883320	4887520	And it you know, you check that out and it does a lot with the game.
4888240	4891240	The the removal of scaling is a big part of it.
4891520	4897360	So in the base game, V and the enemies gain stats as you level up.
4897560	4899800	In this mod, they stop doing that,
4900160	4903600	which is the way people some people prefer to play games.
4903880	4905040	I prefer it that way.
4905040	4907280	I don't like when the enemies level up when you do,
4907280	4910000	because there's something very satisfying about overpowering them.
4910480	4912720	But I guess that's a developer's artistic choice.
4912960	4915400	But I think I would like to use this mod if I played the game.
4915480	4917560	So that's that.
4917560	4919560	Check that out if you are so inclined.
4920240	4922760	Looking at some comments from chat.
4922760	4925720	Sj100Matt says, I haven't touched Cyberpunk this year.
4925720	4928680	Still have it, but waiting for the updates to fully pick it up again.
4928680	4931360	Well, this might be the update to draw your attention,
4931360	4934280	because it sounds like they have fixed an awful lot, that's for sure.
4934520	4936160	So all right.
4936200	4940200	And 5th Dream in chat points out a modder literally released this patch
4940200	4943640	like a week before Project Red suddenly announced the official patch.
4943800	4944320	Whoops.
4945480	4948640	Anyway, let's go to our next segment,
4948640	4954680	because I need to talk about some things that patching wasn't an option back then.
4954960	4956440	So you all know this segment.
4956440	4957080	Here we go.
4966160	4972160	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,
4972160	4976480	where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4976840	4979600	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4981120	4983200	And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Soccer?
4984040	4986080	I picked Arkanoid.
4987520	4991000	And I don't even know why I picked Arkanoid.
4991000	4993280	I was just like, man, what's something old?
4994040	4994800	It's cool.
4995760	5002480	Yeah, so Arkanoid came out in 1986 in July in Japan,
5003000	5007720	US in August 1986, Europe just 1986 sometime.
5008240	5012960	And it is a block breaker arcade game published by Taito.
5013840	5016480	In the US, it was published by Romstar,
5016680	5019760	who is not related to Homestar or Homsar.
5020520	5027200	So you play this paddle spacecraft called the VAUS.
5027760	5033720	And you basically have to clear out the blocks by basically bouncing a ball around.
5033720	5037640	It's like one person pong with ball with a well, I mean, there's balls.
5037680	5039720	There's always balls with blocks.
5041120	5044920	Some blocks are indestructible, some may require multiple hits,
5045760	5050560	but they are, it's kind of addictive and fun.
5051640	5057960	The designers from Taito, Fujita Akira and Tsuji no Hiroshi,
5059640	5064960	were expanding the concept put out by Atari's Breakout, which is very similar.
5067120	5071920	And it was a part of a contest inside of Taito
5072320	5076280	where two teams of designers would have to make a block breaker game
5076280	5078480	and see which one was superior to the other.
5079040	5083880	They also got inspiration from Tron with the games
5085040	5088080	for the games neon-ish aesthetic.
5088880	5092600	And so they designed the levels, they drew everything up.
5092600	5097800	They did like different power ups and different goodies like that.
5098800	5102760	And then they put out some play tests
5103280	5108480	and it was actually better than they expected it to be.
5108480	5111280	It went on to become a major success.
5111280	5117560	It became the highest grossing table arcade cabinet of 1987 in Japan.
5119200	5122520	And then there has just been so much more out of it.
5122520	5124840	So let's go ahead and dig in a little bit.
5125520	5128760	So I told you how you play it.
5128760	5132520	You get like different add-ons, you get different power ups,
5132520	5136280	different things that increase every new level,
5137320	5140800	the various variations, formations, flying enemy ships, you name it.
5142360	5145800	You can even expand the vase, add more balls.
5148080	5153480	Have a laser cannon or break directly into the next level, an extra vase.
5153480	5156320	But the gameplay is always the same.
5156320	5161000	The final stage was just 33 on most versions and 36 on the NES.
5162040	5166200	You fight the boss called DoH.
5167440	5170360	And once you reach that, you no longer have the option
5170360	5173640	to continue out of running out of lives, you play until you're dead.
5176240	5178520	It's always game over.
5178520	5183320	So apparently Tsuchino's,
5183760	5190360	I guess, game developer name was Onijist, O-N-I-J-I-S-T.
5191440	5194240	They were part of Taito's Yokohama Research Institute,
5194800	5198600	and they basically participated in the contest and out it came.
5200440	5204240	And Tsuchino was a big fan of Tron, so that's where a lot of that came in there.
5204240	5209880	Basically, the geometric enemies
5209880	5213800	and their power ups were actually hand drawn from 3D models
5214120	5217480	and converted into sprite art.
5217480	5220840	And then Okura Hisayoshi,
5220840	5223800	who is the founder of Taito's house band,
5224320	5226360	Izunata, did the game's music.
5227840	5230120	Really short development cycle.
5230120	5233320	It was described as murderous.
5235240	5239880	There have been many conversions of various versions.
5240280	5243360	We're talking about ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC,
5243360	5247560	Commodore 64, BBC Micro, MSX, Atari 8-bit, Apple II,
5247880	5252200	NES Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, IBM PC,
5252640	5255120	a Mac version in 1987,
5255880	5259960	a port for the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1989.
5260320	5263600	All the computer ports were done by Imagine.
5263600	5266240	The NES port came with a custom controller.
5268640	5273040	And it really became one of Taito's most profitable games.
5273040	5276800	It pulled money in hand over fist.
5278120	5283920	It was compared in an issue of computer and video games in December 1986,
5284800	5287720	where it was compared to Pong and Space Invaders
5288560	5291880	in regards to simplicity and addictiveness,
5292360	5297960	that it was also simple, colorful, fun, fast and addictive.
5300040	5303600	And it has won the Silver Award from Gamest,
5303600	5306760	Game of the Year from Compute Magazine, Best Arcade Translation.
5306760	5308680	I mean, just all kinds of different things.
5310760	5313880	As far as its legacy is concerned,
5313880	5317640	there were a number of direct and indirect sequels.
5318640	5321760	One of them was Tournament Arkanoid in 1987.
5321800	5323360	It came out in the U.S. by Romstar.
5325120	5329080	It was actually developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan,
5330600	5333000	but it added new levels.
5333000	5338960	There was Revenge of Dou, which is a true sequel with new gameplay mechanics.
5339440	5341320	Came out in arcades in 1987.
5341800	5346560	Arkanoid Dou It Again and Arkanoid Returns in 1997,
5346560	5349120	followed by Arkanoid DS in 2007.
5349520	5354880	Arkanoid Live was published on May 6, 2009 for Xbox Live Arcade.
5355720	5362040	WiiWare got Arkanoid Plus and there is Arkanoid for iOS,
5362840	5366080	which I have it on my phone. I love it.
5367880	5370160	It's one of my time sinks.
5370160	5373760	There is also a mashup called Arkanoid versus Space Invaders,
5373760	5376320	and it came out in 2017 for iOS and Android.
5377000	5381480	And that's it. Our game is Arkanoid.
5382280	5384280	One that I have a lot of memories of, too.
5384880	5387840	That special controller on the NES that I never had.
5388720	5390120	But it looked like a lot of fun.
5390120	5393880	Yeah, I like the one I'm watching right now is like the laser weapon
5393880	5396160	because it was over if I got the laser weapon.
5396200	5398120	Yeah, that's that's very much.
5398120	5400120	Sorry, it's probably causing those listening on podcast
5400120	5402240	like what is that pew pew pew noise I keep hearing?
5402240	5404600	That's because they picked up the laser weapon in the game
5404600	5407320	and they're just using that to really clear the board.
5407320	5408600	This person is actually pretty good.
5408600	5410040	Yeah, they're they're doing that.
5410040	5412320	It's I bet it's Tass.
5412320	5414160	It might be. I don't know. Yeah.
5414160	5416600	So hey, not bad. Yeah. Well, there it is.
5418200	5419840	Oh, man, they got the catch weapon now.
5419840	5422240	I freaking love the catch weapon.
5422240	5424360	I played a lot of that on the NES.
5424360	5427840	I keep forgetting just how long that game has really lived on.
5428040	5430160	I forgot about the Arkanoid versus Space Invaders thing.
5430160	5431880	I wanted to play that. It looked interesting.
5431880	5433800	So I just never got around to it.
5434760	5438560	All right. Let's one day one day sequel.
5439880	5441480	Let's do some rapid fire news.
5441480	5444320	Let's talk about some other headlines, but quickly, Loki.
5446240	5447680	It's happened.
5447680	5449760	I know this is going to come as a shock, but.
5450960	5453720	Skyrim is coming out.
5453720	5456040	Again, that's right.
5456600	5460640	The thesis announced that Skyrim, the anniversary edition.
5461360	5463160	See, they can do this every single year now.
5463880	5465000	Is coming out.
5465000	5469440	It's basically the remastered edition that they had before.
5469480	5473600	But now they're also including 500 Creator Club mods
5473920	5478160	and some other things, as well as support for next gen consoles.
5479120	5482040	That is going to be coming out November 11th.
5483200	5488080	This year, I don't even know what else they could do for newer consoles,
5488080	5490760	like I got to say, I played it'll look prettier.
5491120	5494760	It already looks pretty fucking good on series X, like just because they
5494760	5497480	enhanced it already for the one X when they released that.
5497480	5498480	And it looks really good.
5498480	5500160	So they're going to enhance it again.
5500160	5500760	All right.
5500760	5505080	The Creator Club content that they're putting a value on was all of.
5505080	5508160	I don't know if it now they had.
5508240	5512560	So these were the they're not mods there,
5512840	5515840	but were I don't remember what they're calling them. Not mods.
5516360	5518080	No, we're not charging for mods.
5518080	5520280	That's that's ridiculous. It's micro DLC.
5521280	5524720	So these are like little things that they put together.
5525160	5531040	But also, I can't think that all 500 of those are necessarily Bethesda's
5533200	5536040	micro DLCs or whatever they call them.
5536880	5540920	A lot of it is user made content as well that were actually mods.
5541160	5544480	There's probably something in the fine print that it's like if you put it here,
5544480	5548240	we can get it in a compilation someday and they're fucking all those people over.
5548240	5549800	I'm sure that's got to be part of it.
5549800	5552320	Absolutely. Please enjoy your free copy of the game.
5552320	5553800	You've already bought four times.
5553800	5557240	Yeah. Yeah. Just like was it Warcraft remastered?
5557280	5559720	Yeah. All the mods you make are ours.
5559720	5562120	Signed exhibition.
5563080	5567160	This is why. I'll probably play it, though.
5567720	5569680	I'll still play it.
5573120	5575960	I'm part of the problem and how.
5575960	5579800	So there's that.
5580000	5585680	And then speaking of older games coming back, as Robin mentioned,
5585880	5591640	you know, Quake has been remastered and it's out now on all sorts of platforms.
5591880	5592960	And it looks awesome.
5592960	5594240	And it's got four K.
5594240	5598720	It is awesome support in 120 FPS and all sorts of cool things.
5599080	5601960	Plus mods. You don't have to pay for it.
5601960	5605240	It plays fucking great on the series X,
5605240	5608920	except for the fact that you're with a controller, which now look,
5608920	5613760	I enjoy controller controllers a lot in some games, but like a shooter like Quake,
5613760	5616040	you really have to have keyboard mouse for, in my opinion.
5617120	5621080	So, yeah, I wish you could hook up a keyboard mouse to the light.
5621080	5623840	Well, I think you can hook one up, but I don't think a lot of games support it.
5624440	5626120	But maybe this one does.
5626120	5627760	But as I alluded to earlier in the show,
5627760	5631480	if you got that free quake that they gave away during the last Quake Con,
5632160	5634360	they upgraded it to this version free.
5634360	5636480	And so I did play a little bit of it on my PC.
5636720	5640600	And I don't get to play a lot of 4K games on my PC because it's not like
5640920	5643360	my graphics card can't quite handle it that well.
5643440	5645840	And good luck trying to get a graphics card these days.
5646920	5649320	So I just kind of stuck with what I have and
5650520	5651880	but on what I have, it runs.
5651880	5656520	Thankfully, Quake is an old ass game, so it runs smooth in 4K on my system.
5656520	5658920	I like it a lot. Very pretty.
5658920	5663000	So, D'Artesuya in chat says, I was shocked to learn about the free upgrade.
5663520	5666480	I heard Modern Vintage Gamer was the one that wrote the new Quake,
5666480	5669360	so I wonder if the Xbox One has keyboard mouse support.
5669360	5670360	That would be lovely.
5670360	5672800	But I haven't looked into it, to be quite honest.
5673320	5674800	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5675800	5680160	Well, we have something that makes me happy.
5680800	5685880	Cat Lateral Damage Remiowstered is going to launch on
5685880	5694360	September 15th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.
5694360	5698560	It better be on Mac as well, or else I will riot.
5699440	5703120	But anyway, you can collect treats.
5703120	5711000	You get the collect real cat photos and litter box mode, all that's there.
5711440	5713440	Different progression redesign.
5713440	5718440	But you find the cat treats as rewards for procedural mode.
5718440	5725440	And the PlayStation 5 version has some special features that use the capabilities of the console,
5725440	5729440	with 4K resolution, faster load times, increased render distance,
5729440	5732440	and support for activities and game presets.
5732440	5736440	And, of course, DualSense haptics.
5736440	5737440	So, yay.
5737880	5746880	And then the other is, absolutely, the moment that I saw it, I was at a loss.
5747880	5752880	Sonny Chiba died due to COVID complications.
5754880	5757880	And I had missed this news.
5758320	5761320	And I was absolutely floored.
5761320	5766320	I mean, I grew up watching, you know, a lot of Sonny Chiba movies.
5766320	5772320	And, you know, I just was, you know, he always played the tough guy or the bad guy
5772320	5776320	and the one who would just hit everyone, like, extra hard.
5776320	5779320	Like, I know there was one movie where he, like, punched,
5779320	5782320	like, his character punched him in the face.
5782760	5789760	That it sort of invented the x-ray view of the skull breaking that Mortal Kombat bit off of.
5791760	5800760	But, I mean, his stage name in Japan was Chiba Shinichi.
5800760	5803760	He was born Maeda Asada-ho.
5803760	5809760	And he studied under the same name as Chiba Shinichi.
5810200	5817200	And he studied under one of the great karate masters.
5817200	5819200	And he was a master himself.
5819200	5821200	He could do anything.
5821200	5829200	His nickname was, I mean, he actually didn't get to show any of his skills until 1973
5829200	5832200	where he was in the film Karate Kiba.
5833200	5835200	Of course, he was in Kill Bill.
5835200	5836200	He was in the...
5836200	5838200	This whole crowd knows him from Kill Bill.
5838640	5842640	The early years of OLR were heavily influenced by that movie.
5842640	5844640	We were quoting it left and right.
5844640	5846640	We had parody commercials based on that movie.
5846640	5850640	So, you know, we all saw that movie multiple times.
5851640	5852640	There's more.
5854640	5860640	But he did influence Tarantino films, especially with the 1993 film True Romance.
5861080	5870080	He also was in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift playing a Yakuza boss.
5873080	5879080	But he was doing a lot more in Japan.
5879080	5885080	And he actually had another movie in the works.
5885520	5890520	I mean, he basically...
5890520	5896520	His movies were the blueprints for a lot of our current hyper-violent martial arts movies.
5897520	5905520	One of his roles where he played Tsurugi Takuma, he ripped throats out with his bare hands.
5909520	5913520	And he could kill adversaries with a pencil.
5913960	5916960	I'm actually just reading through some of these other examples.
5916960	5918960	And I remember watching a lot of this, because like I said,
5918960	5922960	I watched a lot of the Sonny Chiba movies when I was a kid.
5922960	5925960	So, yeah.
5927960	5929960	It's a loss.
5929960	5934960	And shoot, at 82, still a pretty good-looking man.
5934960	5936960	Well, fuck COVID, that's for sure.
5936960	5939960	I actually didn't realize it was because of COVID complications.
5939960	5941960	And fuck anti-vaxxers.
5942400	5944400	And pod culture and chat says, get the fucking shot.
5944400	5949400	But I imagine it's not like we here in the States are in that situation
5949400	5952400	where it is very easy to get the shot at this point.
5952400	5955400	We couldn't have said this six months ago, but now it is very easy to get the shot.
5955400	5957400	You just go get it.
5957400	5961400	That I don't think is the case in every country right now.
5961400	5963400	I think we are unique in that circumstance.
5963400	5969400	In every state, even Alabama is being...
5969840	5972840	Alabama is defying national orders right now,
5972840	5975840	and they're not distributing the vaccines the way that they're supposed to.
5975840	5977840	It's absolutely ridiculous.
5977840	5979840	And pod culture and chat says, I was speaking to people in general.
5979840	5981840	Yeah, I get it.
5981840	5983840	That wasn't a drag you or a call out type of thing.
5983840	5986840	I'm just kind of reminding ourselves that not everywhere in the world
5986840	5988840	can get vaccinated right now.
5988840	5992840	So that is even more so why we should be doing it.
5992840	5997840	But the good news is, I heard they're giving the Pfizer shot at least,
5998280	6003280	the official OK on Monday, whatever it had to meet to get that official
6003280	6005280	will happen on Monday, it sounds like.
6005280	6010280	And from there, now they can enforce a mandate on the vaccine and all that stuff.
6010280	6013280	I'm sure Moderna won't be that far behind or J&J.
6013280	6015280	It's just those vaccines came out a little bit later.
6015280	6017280	So I think they have to be out on the market for so long.
6017280	6022280	So yeah, get your vaccine.
6022280	6024280	All right.
6024720	6030720	And the real scary part is now you're hearing about people like Reverend Jesse Jackson
6030720	6033720	and his wife were vaccinated and now they're still in the hospital.
6033720	6035720	Unfortunately, that can happen.
6035720	6037720	They're older.
6037720	6039720	They're in their 80s, if I'm not mistaken.
6039720	6041720	So it stinks.
6041720	6046720	But yeah, it's just even more so like if only the people around them would have been vaccinated.
6046720	6051720	But when you're a people person like the Reverend Jesse Jackson, you probably come in contact with a lot of unvaccinated folks.
6051720	6053720	So it's unfortunate.
6054160	6056160	All right.
6056160	6058160	Let's move on.
6058160	6063160	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things to play while you're at home isolating.
6063160	6065160	Starting in the U.S., Loki.
6065160	6067160	Yes.
6067160	6075160	So this week we have Aliens Fireteam Elite on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
6075160	6081160	We have King's Bounty 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6081160	6086160	Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 on PlayStation 5.
6086160	6093160	Murder Mystery Machine on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6093160	6100160	Psychonauts 2 on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6100160	6110160	Hotel Life Resort Simulator on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6110160	6112160	The Legend of Heroes.
6112160	6118160	Hajimari no Kizuki that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.
6118160	6123160	We've got Spelunky and Spelunky 2 coming on Nintendo Switch as well.
6123160	6128160	Baldo on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6128160	6131160	No More Heroes 3 on Nintendo Switch.
6131160	6139160	And we've got Tormented Souls on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
6139160	6141160	That's it.
6141160	6145160	All right. Well going over to Japan, we have a slightly bigger week now on the Switch.
6145160	6148160	We've had some slow weeks, but there's quite a few games out this week on Japan.
6148160	6151160	On the Nintendo Switch, King's Bounty 2 is out on the 24th.
6151160	6154160	And then when you go ahead to the 26th, you get even more.
6154160	6158160	Sukihime, A Piece of Blue Glass Moon in regular and limited edition.
6158160	6163160	Kamisama no Yuunakimi-e comes out as well in a regular and limited edition.
6163160	6169160	There's also a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Volume 1 from SNK that's out in Japan.
6169160	6171160	Yeah, I thought that might get your attention.
6171160	6172160	Oh, I heard about that, yeah.
6172160	6174160	Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.
6174160	6182160	Let's see, it's SNK Gal Fighters, Samurai Shodown 2, King of Fighters R2, The Last Blade Beyond the Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact,
6182160	6188160	SNK vs. Capcom, Metal Slug First and Second Mission, Dark Arms and Big Tournament Golf.
6188160	6192160	And they actually put like a pocket station type of thing on your phone.
6192160	6195160	Or sorry, not on your phone, on your Switch so you can kind of see.
6195160	6198160	And there's like different ones that you can put on there.
6198160	6203160	So this seems like something you might want to import Dark Sakura if they're not doing a release here locally.
6203160	6205160	Which I don't know if they would.
6205160	6208160	So anyway, that definitely has your name all over it.
6208160	6210160	Yeah, it does.
6210160	6212160	Even I cuddle with that.
6212160	6214160	Let's see, we also have The Legend of Heroes.
6214160	6217160	Hajimari no Kiseki comes out on the 26th as well.
6217160	6222160	And we finally get a release of Destroy All Humans.
6222160	6226160	And Alex Kidd in Miracle World Deluxe are also out this week.
6226160	6229160	Even though those are in English, they are still at least releasing.
6229160	6233160	On the Playstation 5, Hitman 3 is out of Japan.
6233160	6235160	That is an English version.
6235160	6238160	Along with that, Alex Kidd in Miracle World is out there as well.
6238160	6243160	And Override 2, Super Mech League, Ultraman Deluxe Edition.
6243160	6245160	Because of course, Ultraman.
6245160	6248160	Also out this week in Japan, Playstation 5.
6248160	6250160	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
6250160	6255160	We have on the 24th Aliens Fireteam Elite.
6255160	6259160	King's Bounty 2 as well.
6259160	6264160	Also on the 24th is Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2.
6264160	6271160	On the 27th we have Absalom End of Gods.
6272160	6274160	American Fugitive.
6274160	6276160	Tormented Souls.
6276160	6278160	And that's it for this week.
6278160	6279160	Alright.
6279160	6281160	Just a few more stories for you guys.
6281160	6283160	Then we're going to get to the listener round table.
6283160	6285160	I mean just a few.
6285160	6287160	I think we usually take about 5 or 6 stories.
6287160	6289160	But we only have 3 left.
6289160	6291160	It was a little bit of a slower news week, quite honestly.
6291160	6293160	I mean there were some big headlines we've already kind of touched on.
6293160	6297160	But overall, I feel like we're in a little bit of a lull right now in gaming.
6297160	6299160	And I don't know if that's the pandemic.
6299160	6301160	Is that the time of year coming up on Labor Day?
6301160	6302160	Or what?
6302160	6304160	Or all of the above, which is probably the real answer.
6304160	6307160	So anyway, a few more stories for you guys.
6307160	6309160	And we'll start it off with Loki.
6309160	6316160	Yeah, so we have another story regarding the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.
6316160	6318160	No, we're not talking about Activision this time.
6318160	6320160	We're talking about Riot Games.
6320160	6326160	So Riot Games had basically run afoul of DFEH's.
6326160	6337160	They had investigated them and apparently found that they were trying to bar individuals from filing complaints.
6337160	6341160	Or assisting in DFEH cases.
6341160	6348160	And basically also referring to the anti-retaliation, anti-interference provisions.
6349160	6356160	And based on this, they're still kind of causing issues and dragging their heels.
6356160	6367160	I believe what this stems from, if I remember correctly, is that they were supposed to, after investigating some of the discrimination and harassment and stuff that was going on in the company.
6367160	6382160	They were supposed to have been ordered to put out a communication to the employees regarding their rights as employees and how they can reach out if they've experienced any harassment and stuff like that.
6382160	6387160	But apparently they have not done that yet.
6388160	6399160	So the court ordered notice was to inform workers that they may freely cooperate, participate, and obtain potential relief if awarded in the DFEH's pending action.
6399160	6411160	And that Riot Games cannot retaliate or take any adverse action against them for speaking to them or participating in any pending action or obtaining potential relief in such actions.
6411160	6414160	So they haven't done that yet.
6414160	6420160	And this, I think, investigation began back in 2018, and they're still dragging their feet on it.
6420160	6422160	Hmm.
6422160	6426160	Kinsurian, that's just like a communication that they need to send out.
6426160	6428160	What's the holdup here, Riot Games?
6428160	6430160	You might want to click that send email button.
6430160	6433160	Yeah, you're just asking for trouble now.
6433160	6435160	Yeah, this is not a good look.
6435160	6439160	And yeah, like S2100matt in chat says, why delay it if you have nothing to hide, Riot?
6440160	6450160	Exactly. Yeah, so basically a court ordered Riot Games to produce, I guess, they were supposed to have put up this communication.
6450160	6458160	And they ordered Riot to produce, I guess, them back in January 2021.
6458160	6463160	However, they delayed production until April 2021.
6464160	6477160	And then apparently, the settlement separation agreements or whatever that they were providing had some language in it that, you know, DFEH was not happy with.
6477160	6482160	And so they were supposed to be correcting that, and they haven't done that yet.
6482160	6484160	So, hmm.
6484160	6487160	Guys, can't mess around with this stuff.
6487160	6499160	Well, you know, it's like we were talking about with the Activision Blizzard issues a couple of weeks ago that, reminder, are actually still ongoing because, and I already said this once, but I'll say it again, the Blizzard employee requests have gone unresponded to.
6499160	6508160	But when that was all first being talked about, we mentioned several times, you know, Blizzard and Activision are kind of the companies that the spotlight is shining on at the moment.
6508160	6510160	But this is an industry problem.
6510160	6517160	And, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of with Questbuster where it's like, oh, look, Riot Games is in trouble again. Surprised Pikachu phase.
6517160	6528160	So, unfortunately, and I hate to sound so, hmm, la-di-da, about this, because it's serious allegations, but it's also one of those things where it's like, it's not the first time we've heard this out of Riot.
6528160	6532160	So I don't think anybody's particularly surprised to hear this. It's extremely disappointing.
6532160	6540160	But on the other hand, it just goes to show this shittiness is in way too many places that are way too high up in the gaming industry, and it has to end, period.
6540160	6550160	But I'm at least happy to see that our government and the courts are doing what they need to do. It's taken a long time to get here.
6550160	6555160	But this is, again, one of those cases where when the companies can't fix themselves, I guess the government will have to do it.
6555160	6560160	So you might want to click that send email button because it sounds like you have people's attentions.
6560160	6570160	So, anyway, really quickly before I get into my next story, earlier I had mentioned I wonder what it is that's causing the slower Newsweek.
6570160	6578160	A couple people have some explanations there. Mike Def says, next week is going to be filled with news, though, I think. I would agree.
6578160	6585160	Bobby Blackwell says they're all prepping for PAX and Gamescom. Gamescom, yes, but who's going to PAX?
6586160	6594160	I'm not reading because obviously Bobby and I are going to Dragon Con. It's all the same at this point as it is going to PAX.
6594160	6600160	But I mean what companies are going to PAX at this point? I haven't heard of a lot of exhibitors there.
6600160	6605160	They're just now announcing the music guest. Okay, Bobby says he's joking about PAX.
6605160	6612160	But I'm not. What companies are going to PAX? What's going to happen there at this point?
6612160	6621160	So it's very interesting. All right. Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says a lot of exhibitors pulled out.
6621160	6628160	Well, if nothing else, y'all, I'm getting a nice week vacation in Atlanta coming up, getting the hell out of town.
6628160	6637160	It'll be nice. All right. Perhaps this will be a little more exciting, and that is EVO in 2022.
6637160	6642160	EVO is going to be returning to Las Vegas. It was announced this week in 2022.
6642160	6649160	EVO 2021, of course, was held online, but that was better than no EVO at all, which is what happened in 2020.
6649160	6658160	So they did EVO 2021 online, and at the conclusion of it, they announced that EVO will be back in Las Vegas August 5th through 7th, 2022.
6658160	6665160	Except they haven't said where yet, although most people are assuming it'll be at the Mandalay Bay Event Center, as it always has been.
6665160	6670160	But I mean, again, a lot could have changed in the past couple of years.
6670160	6677160	So, yeah, EVO 2022, it's also noted, will be the first in-person tournament since Sony bought them. Remember that?
6677160	6682160	Sony owns EVO now. So it'll be interesting to see what that looks like when it's in person.
6682160	6688160	You got to wonder if maybe some of those like PlayStation Experience, was that when it was PSX, the PlayStation Experience?
6688160	6694160	If some of those elements will come back to like, you know, an in-person type of event.
6694160	6698160	But we have literally a year until we find out what that really looks like.
6698160	6703160	But they have announced that they are going to be aiming for that in person, which, of course, they are.
6703160	6709160	I think we're all hopeful that this will be on its way out, and certainly in a year's time.
6709160	6715160	Oh, who is this that just sat down? That's not the same person that was there before. Hold on.
6715160	6716160	My shirt matches yours.
6716160	6718160	Oh, you changed your shirt. I love it.
6718160	6719160	Yeah, I changed my shirt.
6719160	6722160	And you changed your wig for the podcast listeners.
6722160	6723160	And my lipstick.
6723160	6724160	Also like me.
6724160	6732160	Honestly, this wig is a lot more comfortable, and I was starting to get a headache, so I switched out my wig.
6732160	6735160	Or as Stark Tetsuya says in chat, new wig, who dis?
6735160	6738160	Yeah, I do post that pretty often.
6738160	6745160	All right, well, Dark Sakura, you also tell us stories pretty often here on the show, and we got our last story tonight from you.
6745160	6752160	Yeah, so, well, it's dead, but not really.
6752160	6756160	So Toys R Us is back in the news.
6756160	6760160	Rise from your grave.
6760160	6763160	We have risen from the grave, yeah.
6763160	6769160	So now there's a partnership with Macy's.
6770160	6778160	There's an organization that's also called True Kids Brand that bought the rights to Toys R Us.
6778160	6787160	And then they partnered with a retailer called Beta, B-8-T-A, for small mall stores.
6787160	6792160	But it kind of shows a little bit.
6792160	6795160	There was one in Houston and one in Paramus.
6796160	6798160	And then it closed.
6801160	6813160	And actually, there were a bunch of sensors that would check the move and flow of people through to collect data and to see which display shoppers were most attracted to.
6813160	6820160	But they didn't clarify exactly how it was being created, how long it was being stored for, so a big data problem.
6820160	6827160	So after all of this, both locations closed, especially due to COVID-19.
6827160	6833160	And now, True Kids has been acquired by WHP Global.
6833160	6845160	And now they've done a partnership with Macy's to use their online presence to sell toys under the Toys R Us branding.
6845160	6854160	There is a site, it's not live yet, but Macy's dot com slash Toys R Us, all one word with no dashes.
6854160	6867160	And then on top of that, they're going to be doing shop and shops inside, kind of like when you go to, what is it, JCPenney and there's like a Sephora in there.
6867160	6871160	They're doing Toys R Us's like that inside of Macy's.
6871160	6882160	And they're hoping to increase their holiday sales, because the last time they did something like this was in 2018 when they had an agreement with FAO Schwartz.
6882160	6888160	Which, by the way, FAO Schwartz has stuff at Target now. That blew my mind. I just saw that this week.
6888160	6894160	I was at Target and they had like the keyboard from Big, we all remember that, right, that movie.
6894160	6897160	And there was other stuff like a magic set and things I guess FAO Schwartz was known for.
6897160	6902160	They were selling it at Target and I was like, oh, that's where that ended up.
6902160	6907160	I wonder where KB Toys is going to end up at the 99 cent store.
6907160	6910160	Mm hmm. Who knows?
6910160	6916160	All right. Johnny Woofay in chat says they turned our Toys R Us into a storage facility. Ah, sad face.
6916160	6923160	I haven't seen what the buildings around here changed into. If anything, they're probably, they're probably haunted.
6923160	6929160	Oh, Hobby Lobby. Gross. All right. Is that what the old birdcage one is?
6929160	6937160	Yes, it's a Hobby Lobby, which doesn't make any sense because like literally like right behind it is a Michaels. Why?
6937160	6939160	Anyway.
6939160	6941160	Hobby Lobby is the devil anyway.
6941160	6946160	As 200 Matt says, Dollar General. Yeah, just just what we need more of, dollar stores.
6946160	6951160	And actually Dollar General Rob predates Dollar Tree.
6951160	6954160	Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah, they're they're different.
6954160	6960160	Dejirama S points out the Toys R Us by me as a spirit Halloween. Oh, don't get me started on spirit Halloween.
6960160	6968160	I mean, I love the store, but it's we all know the meme of building has become a spirit store.
6968160	6973160	You know, it's silly. Bobby Blackwell says ours is a Burlington.
6973160	6977160	Ours is a Burlington coat factory. Oh, now that that's a store I like.
6977160	6984160	I like coats. Yeah, I like coats. I guess I've gotten some great coats at Burlington Coat Factory, so can't complain too much.
6984160	6988160	All right. Anyway, we're going to get into the listener roundtable.
6988160	6994160	If you would like to give us a call, join our discord, vog network dot com slash discord and hit up the green room channel.
6994160	6997160	And we'll take some calls if anybody wants to call.
6997160	7002160	We also use this opportunity to check in with our mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.
7002160	7007160	It's the place to send an email. I'm not sure we got any this week, but I'll look to dark soccer to confirm.
7007160	7011160	OK, there it is. We got Jack and shit.
7011160	7016160	Well, then you can also tell us in chat if there's something you'd like for us to talk about or what have you.
7016160	7020160	But now everybody's talking about spirit Halloween.
7020160	7027160	As 200 Matt says, the dead mall by me turned the now gone Saks Fifth Avenue into spirit Halloween.
7027160	7032160	Wow. Wow. When a Saks turns into one, what a crazy shit.
7032160	7037160	Well, I mean, I love spirit, but let's be real. It's a downgrade.
7037160	7042160	Interesting. Bobby Blackwell says it was originally going to be a hobby lobby, but that fell through.
7042160	7048160	So it's now a Burlington. Oh, interesting. Hobby Lobby is evil.
7048160	7053160	Tiger Cost says, you know, another store that's gone Sears, you know, another store that's gone.
7053160	7061160	Montgomery Ward. Sears last year was a spirit Halloween store.
7061160	7067160	What was it? Oh, wow. Yeah, it was. But now that whole side of the whole mall is dead pretty much.
7067160	7072160	I mean, like I was driving by it the other day and looking at it, it's just like there's no one there.
7072160	7077160	I think I went inside there and like half the mall is closed off. It's just it's.
7077160	7085160	Yeah, yikes. Because I think those those theaters are gone now.
7085160	7090160	Oh, man. The discount theaters. Yeah. Lord knows what you're stepping in on the floor.
7090160	7096160	The sign outside. Oh, God. Yeah. They saw the sign outside. But yeah, it's gone.
7096160	7101160	They should. Somebody should just write in the marquee jokes like coming soon. Spirit Halloween store.
7101160	7107160	People should do that. I don't understand. Anyway, we do have somebody waiting in the green room to come on the show,
7107160	7111160	so we'll get to it and bring them in, invite them to talk to us.
7111160	7117160	Hi there. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Pixel Pacas. Hey, Pixel Pacas.
7117160	7121160	It is great to have you on the show. How are you doing? I'm doing well.
7121160	7125160	Thanks. Loving the show as always. Well, thank you so much. Loving having you here.
7125160	7130160	What's on your mind? So I just wanted to bring up some news that it's kind of a big deal to me.
7130160	7137160	And some other folks might be interested as well. Sure. So in Banning, California, it's kind of just out there.
7137160	7144160	Yeah. I know about this. Yeah. The Museum of Pinball is closing.
7144160	7151160	Which is sad. I only got to go there once, though. Tons of pinball machines, also arcade machines.
7151160	7159160	But the owners, they announced they're closing it like maybe this month. Is that the one in the Bay Area or the one in the desert?
7159160	7164160	No, no. I thought it was the one in Alameda, Rob, when I told you. That one also closed.
7164160	7169160	Well, they're not permanently closed. That's the Pacific Pinball Museum, I think.
7169160	7174160	OK, so Banning's the one because I think there was a convention there. I was looking at it, looking into going.
7174160	7180160	And it's down in, like, Palm Springs. OK, so it is kind of the desert.
7180160	7184160	OK, sorry. Just had to get my geography straightened out. Sorry.
7184160	7191160	Yeah, it's huge. It was like 40,000 square feet or something. Yeah, it's a big place.
7191160	7197160	I regret never getting to go. There ain't a lot of there ain't a lot of shit to do in the desert.
7197160	7204160	I mean, again, you had to explain to me very, very thoroughly where Banning, California was in the first place.
7204160	7211160	Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing there except kind of an airport and a casino. But anyway, so they're closing.
7211160	7216160	I got to go once. It was really cool. I'm sad that they're closing, but I mean, they couldn't do anything during COVID.
7216160	7222160	Right. So I think that probably plays into it. They couldn't open. They couldn't do anything for over a year.
7222160	7228160	But now they're going to be auctioning off everything. Oh, over 1000 machines.
7228160	7235160	The auction's already open. Yeah, it's it's gonna be live, like starting September 10th.
7235160	7243160	But you can register now. You can look. You can preview everything now. You can bid in person or online.
7243160	7247160	I'm laughing because Alan's in the other room. And I started looking at it.
7247160	7252160	He can hear it because he hears the playback here in the studio. So he's he's in the other room.
7252160	7259160	I'm looking right at him going, baby Pac-Man, baby Pac-Man. I'm mouthing it. And he's like, no, we don't have the space.
7259160	7265160	No. But Rob, what? Baby Pac-Man, you can keep it at my house.
7265160	7271160	Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan. Rob can keep it at my house. Baby Pac-Man.
7271160	7279160	There you go. Oh, he said fine. He relented. OK, yeah. And it'll get to live at my house.
7279160	7283160	Now, we actually just switched out. We traded a temporary trade.
7283160	7290160	We have the Rick and Morty table right now. We traded our Metallica temporarily.
7290160	7295160	Nice. Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in to hear me scream baby Pac-Man in your face.
7295160	7299160	Is there is there a machine that you're looking at getting in throughout all this or what do you think?
7299160	7304160	I'm just looking at this point. You know, I would like a pinball machine. I don't have any at this point,
7304160	7312160	but I would like to kind of get started in that world of take of arcade and pinball machines taking over my life.
7312160	7316160	I'm ready. And your house? Yes, I'm ready.
7316160	7321160	Dark Soccer, you should be giving away a free toaster that'll run Doom.
7321160	7325160	Do you watch Jack Danger? I do.
7325160	7330160	Cool. And actually talk to him. Message him sometime because he's really good with advice.
7330160	7336160	Nice. Yeah. Sure. And there's a pin side. Good for him there.
7336160	7342160	But there's also I think it's like road you pin is another group, I think.
7342160	7348160	OK, I haven't heard of that one. I'll see if I can find it. But I think they're by Papa.
7348160	7354160	The like Pacific arcade pinball something. So Bobby Blackwell is asking in chat,
7354160	7359160	do they ship? Because I think he has a particular machine in mind. That's the thing.
7359160	7364160	I think I'm pretty sure. Oh, I could have sent the link to you. I think you have to manage that yourself.
7364160	7368160	They have some recommended shipping partners or whatever, but it's really up to you.
7368160	7372160	I think they'll give you a pallet, but you've got to figure out how you're going to take that. Get that to you.
7372160	7377160	Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, I think a pinball is not cheap.
7377160	7382160	It is. Yeah. Who wants to rent a U-Haul and go down to Palm Springs with me?
7382160	7386160	Dark Soccer, Loki. I'll do it. All right.
7386160	7390160	Rob, you know, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm supposed to be saving money.
7390160	7394160	You know what? You know, you have the insider info. I was saving money.
7394160	7398160	I know why. And Rob, what? What am I? But an enabler.
7398160	7402160	You should do it. You should do it. I'm really fun.
7402160	7407160	Rob, YOLO, YOLO. And then and then and then and then and then.
7407160	7412160	No, we could do we could do. Hey, Alan, Alan, YOLO.
7412160	7416160	I didn't realize that Street Fighter two pinball machine. That's pretty cool.
7416160	7420160	Yeah, it's not very good. It's a got live one, I think. Do they have that?
7420160	7424160	OK, so like in when Bobby was talking about Southern Fried Game Rex,
7424160	7428160	Southern Fried Game Room Expo on a show tonight, he was showing footage from the event.
7428160	7434160	And they actually had the big boy Mario Brothers pinball table, which you see far less
7434160	7438160	frequently than the little the more smaller one that was more for kids.
7438160	7443160	And that is that is what I almost feel like Bobby might want that slightly more than Dr.
7444160	7448160	No, probably not, because Mrs. Black Wolf is going to want the doctor who table.
7448160	7451160	So. But yeah, I think that that's up there on the list, too.
7451160	7457160	And I honestly I love that Mario Brothers table, too, because they have a circus full tear.
7457160	7462160	I might want to bid on that. Hmm. Hmm. They had a circus full tear.
7462160	7470160	All right. Well, I need to look and see if I actually I would love to have an Arabian Nights.
7470160	7473160	Because it's a Papa Duke. Do they have a baby? I haven't. I'm trying to do a show.
7473160	7478160	I can't look at the catalog. Do they have a baby? It doesn't have like a search thing on here either.
7478160	7484160	All right. There. Oh, no. Yeah, there's actually if you go in advance search, there's like a keyword search.
7484160	7489160	They might be able to do that. There's only 742 lot items. It's fine.
7489160	7495160	They're still adding more, though. Oh, OK. And Bobby Black Wolf says there is not a baby Pac-Man.
7495160	7504160	There is? No. Oh, damn. Well, I think there's also two lots, though, because it's two auctions.
7504160	7508160	I'm sure everybody's doing cartwheels hearing there isn't one after all.
7508160	7513160	That's all right. Bobby Black will just point out Lot 503 is Circus Voltaire.
7513160	7520160	So, yeah, it's probably not going to happen. We've got to do adult stuff.
7521160	7529160	What happened to enabling? Oh, yeah, but you don't have you don't have a Dan.
7529160	7535160	I can enable you. One ninety nine is a Max 2 machine. Really?
7535160	7540160	See, I really don't have the space for like an entire DDR machine. You on the other hand, Loki.
7540160	7547160	I don't think of that much space. We actually don't because of all the pinball and the Mustang in the garage.
7547160	7553160	And I mean, get this. We've got a Mustang. Come on. Drop.
7553160	7557160	This is Dan's first car. This is baby.
7557160	7561160	I know. I know it's a pain. And you know what? You know what the deal with that is, right?
7561160	7568160	Is that when Dan dies, I have to stuff his corpse into it, push it off a cliff and explode it midair.
7568160	7573160	I really don't know how to respond to that.
7573160	7582160	Little does he know I'm going to do like a paper craft Mustang and use that and then keep the real thing and put air conditioning in that sucker.
7582160	7590160	See, you need to be more specific. All right, Marcus, thank you for calling into the show and alerting us to the pinball sale,
7590160	7596160	which led to conversations about Dan's funeral, which are entirely premature.
7596160	7600160	But hey, that's the way things go here on Orange Launch Radio sometimes.
7600160	7605160	So, hey, anything else you want to shout out or get on out before we let you go?
7605160	7609160	No, I just wanted to share that because I figured it'd be of interest.
7609160	7614160	I still haven't figured out if I'm actually going, but if I am, you know, maybe I'll see if I can do anything to help you guys out.
7614160	7620160	Well, Marcus, you figured correctly. Thank you for being in the neighborhood tonight on Orange Launch Radio.
7620160	7625160	All right. Bye, my friend. Bye.
7625160	7630160	I hope he didn't mind that I called him by his display name on Discord out of reflex and not PixelPakas.
7630160	7634160	Oops. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go to our next call.
7634160	7637160	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7637160	7640160	It's the one and only DJ Ron Maness. How is everybody tonight?
7640160	7643160	Rama, so good to see you. Literally see you.
7643160	7646160	Oh, it's you.
7646160	7649160	I have to represent the old rules.
7649160	7651160	I missed you, Ron Chan.
7651160	7654160	Wait, there's a pinball machine called Gay Nineties.
7654160	7658160	Yes, there is a bar called the Gay Nineties in Minneapolis.
7658160	7665160	So usually when you hear the term gay nineties is referring to the eighteen nineties, which was like, yeah, it's referring to that.
7665160	7671160	It looks it. Yeah, it just looked weird. Like I was trying to figure out what the theme was supposed to be because they've got like, you know.
7671160	7674160	No, it's not. It's not referring to queerest folk on Showtime.
7674160	7679160	It's not referring to Will and Grace. What else was gay nineties? It's not referring to Frasier.
7679160	7682160	Let's be real. Everybody on that show is gay. It's not.
7682160	7684160	And I'm the cheerleader.
7684160	7686160	And I'm on comedy show. All right.
7686160	7690160	But you did not call in to talk about the gay nineties, Rama, Loki.
7690160	7693160	What did you call in to talk about tonight?
7693160	7696160	But I'm always here to listen to your amazing gay stories, Rob. You know that.
7696160	7700160	Well, thank you. Thank you. Ah, fair.
7700160	7703160	OK, a couple of quick stories. I'll be on my merry little way.
7703160	7709160	All right. So for the last few weeks, I've been playing this game called The Ascent, and it's a great cyberpunk ish game.
7709160	7713160	And, you know, you know, when you get into a game, you're really into the controller.
7713160	7717160	Then you're wondering, why is the controller not working the way it should?
7717160	7720160	So the trigger button started to stick on my Xbox.
7720160	7726160	So I get the WD-40 sprayed in there and it should be fine.
7726160	7736160	A couple of weeks later, start sticking again, and then I spray more WD-40 in the controller at two thirty in the morning when the only light that I have is off the TV.
7736160	7741160	Did not realize I shot so much WD-40 into it that the entire controller was just lagging like crazy.
7741160	7744160	So you made it extra slippery.
7744160	7746160	Yup.
7746160	7750160	So I'm like, I'll just order another Xbox one control off Amazon.
7750160	7754160	How hard can that be? Famous words.
7754160	7759160	I didn't expect to find them going as high as 80 to 100 dollars.
7759160	7760160	They're not.
7760160	7763160	Well, I didn't know there was a shortage going on or something.
7763160	7765160	The one or the Series X?
7765160	7769160	No, the Xbox one controller.
7769160	7773160	And I thought, well, Microsoft so long are making them, so they're making the series controller.
7773160	7776160	And I'm like, I'd rather have an Xbox one controller.
7776160	7781160	So if I happen to sell my Xbox one, I won't lose any value on it.
7781160	7783160	So I track one down.
7783160	7787160	I get I find a remanufactured one for sixty five dollars.
7787160	7790160	Perfect. A few days later, the mail shows up.
7790160	7796160	I grab the package. I open it up.
7796160	7799160	They send me an Xbox series controller instead.
7799160	7802160	What?
7802160	7806160	I'm just sitting here laughing like Kiyo Kusanagi from King of Fighters.
7806160	7808160	I'm like, are you serious right now?
7808160	7810160	But the series controller is really good.
7810160	7815160	I would imagine you would have gone full on Orochi if we were going to use that analogy.
7815160	7819160	I mean, to be perfectly honest, I'm just like, does it work?
7819160	7820160	Yeah, it works.
7820160	7822160	It's a controller, Rama.
7822160	7823160	Thank you.
7823160	7829160	I'm like, if I wanted a series controller, I would have just gone to Best Buy when I go out once a week and bought one.
7829160	7830160	Yeah.
7830160	7832160	So can you return it?
7832160	7838160	Yeah. Amazon is shipping me an official renewed Xbox one controller and it should arrive on Tuesday.
7838160	7839160	And it let me keep that one?
7839160	7841160	No, I've got to send that one back.
7841160	7842160	Ah, I was going to say.
7842160	7844160	Well, hey, it was a nice chance to sample it, at least.
7844160	7845160	Yeah.
7845160	7847160	I would say it's really nice.
7847160	7850160	But Jamie, you know, there are ways around certain things.
7850160	7851160	I'm not going to.
7851160	7854160	So, you know, there are ways around certain things.
7854160	7858160	Yes.
7858160	7860160	And another thing, and I'll be on my merry little way.
7860160	7861160	No problem.
7861160	7866160	You know how lately Hallmark has been doing a lot of retro gaming ornaments and stuff like that?
7866160	7867160	Oh, yeah.
7867160	7870160	I got the, uh, the NES, the NES.
7870160	7872160	I got a few of them.
7872160	7874160	This one has been very popular on Amazon.
7874160	7875160	The Super Nintendo one.
7875160	7877160	I have it.
7877160	7878160	Did you, did you hook it?
7878160	7880160	Did you put into batteries?
7880160	7881160	No.
7881160	7882160	So wait.
7882160	7884160	Wait, I think I have that one.
7884160	7886160	I didn't know it took batteries though.
7886160	7887160	Yeah.
7887160	7888160	This came out this year.
7888160	7889160	Oh, this year?
7889160	7891160	No, then I have, um, the last year, the NES.
7891160	7892160	Yeah.
7892160	7895160	This, this year for 2021, it's the Super NES.
7895160	7897160	I need to get it.
7897160	7899160	And it goes with three batteries.
7899160	7907160	And if you put it in, I hit the power button.
7907160	7909160	We're waiting to hear.
7909160	7910160	Does it make you hear it?
7910160	7913160	No, no sound isn't coming through for us.
7913160	7914160	Oh, damn.
7914160	7915160	You have to tell us what's it doing?
7915160	7919160	It's playing on the first level theme from Super Mario World.
7919160	7921160	Oh, that's adorable.
7921160	7924160	Complete with sound effects.
7924160	7930160	Or as Bobby Black Wolf in chat currently says, ordering that.
7930160	7931160	Good luck.
7931160	7935160	Because our fucking callers tonight are just enabling the shit out of all of us.
7935160	7936160	God damn.
7936160	7938160	I'm closing these lines back up.
7938160	7939160	No more phone calls.
7939160	7940160	No more phone calls.
7940160	7941160	I'm just kidding.
7941160	7942160	I heart you guys.
7942160	7944160	If you want one of these good luck.
7944160	7949160	Cause I've been following Wario 64 for about a week and a half trying to get one.
7949160	7952160	And when I got one on Amazon, it says it's secure.
7952160	7953160	You have it.
7953160	7955160	They'll say your order has been canceled.
7955160	7956160	I get another notification.
7956160	7958160	I go back and I order it.
7958160	7963160	I'm told we're going to hold your money until we get one and we'll charge you when it ships
7963160	7965160	and lo and behold.
7965160	7970160	Yeah, I am going to have to, I mean, am I just sweet?
7970160	7978160	I've actually been pretty lucky going to, uh, the, uh, the actual hallmark store near
7978160	7979160	my house.
7980160	7982160	So I might have a hallmark store out in Roseville.
7982160	7984160	That's not near your house, but I know that one.
7984160	7986160	Well, no, there's, there's one out here in EG.
7986160	7989160	Um, and I have to go to target tomorrow and it's right next door to target.
7989160	7993160	So good times shopping.
7993160	7996160	There is a hallmark store in New York city, right.
7996160	8001160	And report authority, but I'm like, I'm not going to spend two 75 to go there.
8001160	8005160	The risk that they don't have and spend another two 75 going home.
8005160	8009160	But there's, but they do, they've got like arcade machine, um, ornaments and a bunch
8009160	8011160	of different Mario and Luigi ones.
8011160	8015160	I got, uh, I think I got like the eight bit Luigi one before you got it.
8015160	8016160	Yeah.
8016160	8017160	Yep.
8017160	8020160	Bobby says, if you go onto hallmark.com, you can do curbside pickup and Bobby says
8020160	8023160	they have five and he can order one for curbside pickup near him.
8023160	8027160	So, um, that is another option you could do doing it now.
8027160	8029160	Log it in hacking the planet.
8029160	8033160	Um, before I let you go, I got something for you.
8033160	8037160	I want to know, um, out here, we were hearing, hearing about hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.
8037160	8038160	How you doing?
8038160	8041160	Is, did that affect you or was that more long Island?
8041160	8043160	Give me tropical storm honoree.
8043160	8044160	Yeah.
8044160	8046160	Oh, that was, that ended up being a big deal.
8046160	8047160	Yeah.
8047160	8054160	Just, just so you know, technically I live in long Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and
8054160	8056160	Suffolk County is basically long.
8056160	8057160	Okay.
8057160	8058160	Yeah.
8058160	8059160	Yeah.
8059160	8060160	I've, I've, I've been through that.
8060160	8061160	Holy crap.
8061160	8062160	Uh oh.
8062160	8066160	And there's a battleship one.
8066160	8067160	She's in the zone.
8067160	8068160	Here we fucking go.
8068160	8069160	No, no.
8069160	8073160	My transformers loving self is like, bitch.
8073160	8077160	That and even Dan's not going to protest that one to be honest.
8077160	8080160	So I have been seeing a lot of transformer stuff, Jamie.
8080160	8083160	I will start emailing you some of the stuff that I see.
8083160	8084160	Okay.
8084160	8086160	Well, you know, I'm not on Facebook anymore.
8086160	8088160	So that's why I said email.
8088160	8089160	Yeah.
8089160	8090160	Thank you.
8090160	8091160	You're welcome.
8091160	8092160	You're welcome.
8092160	8095160	I'm glad to see your internet's up and you're not under water.
8095160	8098160	Cause the news out here was making it sound pretty terrible.
8098160	8103160	That's because I'm in zone B, basically three zones.
8103160	8109160	You put in your address, A, B, or C if it's zone, a pack your shit and go zone B. You
8109160	8112160	might not have to pack, but just be careful.
8112160	8114160	Zone C you're good.
8114160	8119160	So was fire Island and zone a, cause I bet they were probably.
8120160	8123160	Remember you need a special bus to get over to fire.
8123160	8124160	Yeah.
8124160	8125160	They have one.
8125160	8128160	Do you want me to get one too?
8128160	8129160	Uh, yeah, sure.
8129160	8130160	For you.
8130160	8131160	Sure.
8131160	8132160	Actually they're only letting me get one.
8132160	8133160	Sorry.
8133160	8134160	That's all right.
8134160	8135160	I'll log in and look and see if the Roseville store has them.
8135160	8136160	All right.
8136160	8137160	Y'all happy?
8137160	8138160	Y'all happy?
8138160	8139160	You made a sale.
8139160	8140160	Y'all happy?
8140160	8141160	You made a sale.
8141160	8142160	Congrats.
8142160	8145160	That's all right.
8145160	8146160	All right.
8146160	8151160	Wrap it up before you, before you sell us some something else, anything else on your
8151160	8152160	mind tonight?
8152160	8153160	No, that's it.
8153160	8156160	I just didn't think this was going to turn into everybody buying stuff.
8156160	8157160	Yeah.
8157160	8158160	Yeah.
8158160	8159160	Yeah.
8159160	8160160	Happy holidays.
8160160	8161160	They're not letting me do the pickup.
8161160	8162160	All right.
8162160	8163160	Take care Rama.
8163160	8164160	All right.
8164160	8165160	Take care.
8165160	8166160	All right.
8166160	8169160	Listen to anime jam session Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.
8169160	8170160	All right.
8171160	8174160	Uh, I think that was all the, uh, the calls that we had there waiting to go.
8174160	8175160	Um, let's see.
8175160	8179160	Uh, Oh, as 200 Matt says, yeah, fire Island was evacuated.
8179160	8181160	I actually, I went there once.
8181160	8184160	Uh, I think it was like 2006.
8184160	8186160	Uh, don't get it twisted.
8186160	8191160	It wasn't anything scandalous that you said, like me and my lesbian friend took the ferry
8191160	8192160	out there.
8192160	8194160	He just to see what it was all about.
8194160	8199160	Cause we always hear about fire out, fire out and like nothing was that we saw a house
8199160	8203160	party going on and we walked to the beach and we were like, all right, it's cold.
8203160	8204160	Let's go back.
8204160	8205160	So that was my trip.
8205160	8209160	That was my exciting trip to fire Island way back in the day.
8209160	8211160	But I hope everybody's okay.
8211160	8212160	All right.
8212160	8214160	Um, I guess that's it.
8214160	8216160	We didn't get any, uh, emails tonight.
8216160	8218160	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
8218160	8221160	The listeners have had enough say tonight on our wallets.
8221160	8224160	So that's where every gamer has a voice.
8224160	8225160	Nope.
8225160	8226160	We're done.
8226160	8227160	We're done.
8227160	8228160	No.
8228160	8232160	Uh, Rama says you have to go to fire Island during June for obvious reasons.
8232160	8234160	Someday, one of these days, uh, I'll get back out there.
8234160	8235160	All right.
8235160	8239160	Oh, I didn't even check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories, but I
8239160	8240160	guess I should do that.
8240160	8241160	Loki.
8241160	8242160	Do you have any last minute stories?
8242160	8243160	Uh, no, but I was gonna mention a lot.
8243160	8245160	57 57 is a pair of hair paradise.
8245160	8246160	Second mix.
8246160	8251160	And of course lot Thursday, three 17.
8251160	8255160	It's ready for shipping to 50 inch monitors included Derby owners club.
8256160	8257160	Get out.
8257160	8260160	I don't have room for a doc at my house.
8260160	8262160	A Derby owner's club.
8262160	8264160	We need to just put in and have like the big warehouse.
8264160	8268160	That's nothing but like our own combined personal arcade.
8268160	8269160	That would be very cool.
8269160	8270160	Yeah.
8270160	8271160	Yeah.
8271160	8272160	Oh my gosh.
8272160	8273160	All right.

8307160	8308160	I really appreciate you.

8316160	8317160	too.
8317160	8318160	Uh, you can check that out.
8318160	8321160	Um, and maybe even more to come soon in the future.
8321160	8323160	So, um, that is about it.
8323160	8325160	Now we're going to get final thoughts.
8325160	8327160	Um, dark soccer, are you streaming tonight?
8327160	8328160	I am streaming tonight.
8328160	8330160	So we'll start with you.
8330160	8331160	All right.
8331160	8336160	Um, uh, pig is the best killer in dead by daylight.
8336160	8338160	And if you argue with me, you're wrong.
8338160	8339160	All right.
8339160	8340160	Uh, have a good one.
8340160	8341160	Enjoy.
8341160	8342160	Have a good stream.
8342160	8343160	I'm popping out now.
8343160	8344160	Yep.
8344160	8345160	Sounds good.
8345160	8346160	And, uh, let's see your final thought.
8346160	8347160	Loki.
8347160	8353160	Uh, my final thought is I'm going to try to work in some more games through out my week.
8353160	8355160	So I'm not just playing Minecraft all the time.
8355160	8356160	Good idea.
8356160	8358160	Although Minecraft is cool too as well.
8358160	8359160	Don't get me wrong.
8359160	8360160	Yeah.
8360160	8361160	I'm still playing that.
8361160	8362160	Yeah.
8362160	8365160	And, uh, my final thought is I I'm going to keep, keep sampling some games on that cloud
8366160	8367160	gaming Xbox stuff.
8367160	8368160	Cause it's pretty fun.
8368160	8370160	So, uh, and I need to play more 12 minutes.
8370160	8371160	I didn't even talk about that.
8371160	8373160	I started 12 minutes and I didn't get very far.
8373160	8375160	I got distracted and that was that.
8375160	8377160	So maybe next week we'll talk a little bit about that.
8377160	8379160	Lots of games to talk about.
8379160	8385160	Uh, we will be back next week and that will be our last show for a couple of weeks because,
8385160	8387160	uh, there is no show labor day weekend.
8387160	8390160	Uh, as, as has been the case for like seven years, ever since I started going to dragon
8390160	8393160	con, uh, there hasn't been a show labor day weekend.
8393160	8394160	So just keep that in mind.
8394160	8397160	We'll be back next week, but we'll, we'll not be here in two weeks.
8397160	8399160	So we hope to see you next week for an all new OLR.
8399160	8403160	And my apologies, I should have put this at the beginning of the show, but my apologies
8403160	8404160	to the podcast listeners.
8404160	8408160	Um, because the cast took forever to get up on the feed this last week.
8408160	8413160	Um, because the show had a major tech kick up and when that stuff happens, it just takes
8413160	8415160	me a lot longer to put together.
8415160	8416160	And I got really lazy.
8416160	8417160	Sorry guys.
8417160	8418160	But there's also a lot going on.
8418160	8419160	And then I had internet issues here.
8419160	8423160	I'm actually glad the internet held out tonight cause we were having internet issues and I
8423160	8425160	was a little worried we weren't even going to get to have a show tonight.
8425160	8428160	So thank you internet gods for holding out tonight.
8428160	8429160	I appreciate that.
8429160	8430160	All right, let's wrap it up.
8430160	8433160	We'll see you in seven days for an all new OLR.
8433160	8434160	Have a great week.
8434160	8435160	Happy gaming.
