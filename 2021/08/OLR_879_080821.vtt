WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.420
If there's one downside to an unexpected and massive spike in success, it's that

00:13.420 --> 00:16.420
when things go back to normal it can look worse by comparison.

00:16.420 --> 00:20.540
That quote this week applies to Nintendo whose 2021 looks quote unquote worse year over year

00:20.540 --> 00:24.660
because Animal Crossing, the third biggest selling game last year has no equal for Nintendo

00:24.660 --> 00:25.860
so far this year.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.100
A completely obvious quote and yet rarely considered when it matters.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.580
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki to bring you everything

00:32.580 --> 00:35.580

02:33.380 --> 02:41.580
all right uh well he wanted to go to lazy dog instead I was like this is much better but he

02:41.580 --> 02:50.300
had a good time all right good good all right um so uh I'm glad he's 11 now right he is yeah we did

02:50.300 --> 02:56.220
his actual like uh birthday party with his friends yesterday so oh my gosh time flies that's that's

02:56.220 --> 03:01.620
crazy but he's he's he's kind of grown up to be a little gamer just like you right he plays a lot of

03:01.620 --> 03:04.780
like Minecraft and all that stuff I mean you talk about that a little bit on the show he's doing all

03:04.780 --> 03:10.660
the prickly roadblocks roblox all roadblocks yeah does he create in roblox because I know he was

03:10.660 --> 03:15.820
going to um those coding classes um pre-covid he went he went well he he did actually go to

03:15.900 --> 03:23.180
a summer camp not that long ago like I think sometime in July um to learn how to make levels

03:23.180 --> 03:30.740
and uh worlds and roblox I don't think he does anything with it he just basically plays I don't

03:30.740 --> 03:35.420
they play a lot of this thing called Brookhaven which is kind of like a roleplay game mm-hmm but

03:35.420 --> 03:39.100
not like a traditional roleplay game it's like I'm gonna pretend to be a high school student you

03:39.100 --> 03:45.260
know type of thing or um I don't know my son just my my younger son keeps talking about it all the

03:45.260 --> 03:52.860
time he watches this guy um omg I guess who's on youtube that there's like lore in the game

03:53.660 --> 03:58.540
about this agency or something I don't know so they they kind of go between that and there's

03:58.540 --> 04:03.820
this other ninja game that they play it's kind of like a it's not a clicker game per se but it's

04:03.820 --> 04:10.220
it's like that set up you know where you grind something and then you can you kind of prestige

04:10.300 --> 04:16.780
or whatever and you get more you know bonuses towards earning in-game money and stuff like that

04:16.780 --> 04:25.500
see I remember Becky's son was into this pirate 101 mmo for kids I that and that's different than

04:25.500 --> 04:29.900
puzzle pirates which I think we all played at one point or another I actually didn't play puzzle

04:29.900 --> 04:33.980
pirates oh you didn't I thought you did at one point nope okay I thought about it and never did

04:34.620 --> 04:39.820
like I am with many a game it's it's interesting though to hear how like 11 year olds are are you

04:39.820 --> 04:45.900
know exploring through things like um you know the pirate 101 or uh roblox or minecraft or whatever

04:45.900 --> 04:52.940
because here comes uncle roberts back in my day I don't know about you guys but we had neo pets

04:52.940 --> 04:58.060
and Gaia online we didn't even have that shit I'm talking about when like I was 11 and 12 we didn't

04:58.060 --> 05:03.500
have any of that shit on Commodore 64 you know we had we had pen and paper and so we would draw

05:03.500 --> 05:08.060
our little dungeons on the pen and paper complete with like the item store that you could shop at

05:08.060 --> 05:13.660
beforehand and we would draw I know some of you kids did this too that like you draw out the thing

05:13.660 --> 05:17.580
and like your little like here's where you start here's the final boss here's the pit of something

05:17.580 --> 05:25.020
and whatever and then it's it's basically dnd without dice and like your own house rules it's

05:25.020 --> 05:30.620
basically that that's that's what we did without roblox has we used to use the study lab though

05:30.620 --> 05:35.820
this is when I was a senior in high school my friend Ashley and I would make up our own rpg

05:35.820 --> 05:42.780
and then we would just spend an hour role playing um now I will say uh when I was around 13 in

05:42.780 --> 05:47.500
junior high and I guess I would be like 12 we did play scorched earth on lunch break in the science

05:47.500 --> 05:51.740
lab like the science teacher loved it he let us come in there and take over the computers like as

05:51.740 --> 05:55.900
long as like he he would kind of like walk around and just make sure we weren't like looking at porn

05:55.900 --> 05:59.980
or something or you know whatever but like when he saw that we were just nerds shooting each other

05:59.980 --> 06:04.220
with tanks he was like all right these kids are fine these kids are gonna be okay and look at me

06:04.220 --> 06:12.380
now look at you little did he know I'd actually love to see how that guy's doing he was he was

06:12.940 --> 06:17.500
Mr Abe if you're out there give me a holler you never know you know what's funny is that after

06:17.500 --> 06:24.780
I graduated high school I actually in the phone book looked up my french teacher to wish her a

06:24.780 --> 06:31.500
pleasant Bastille day you know my my one of my favorite teachers ever was one of my math teachers

06:31.500 --> 06:36.620
in junior high school and my mom ran into her at the mall right before it's probably about a year

06:36.620 --> 06:41.340
before my mom passed she ran into her at the the mall out in Roseville and I guess they had like

06:41.340 --> 06:45.900
they she recognized the teacher and they had a pleasant conversation and I remember right when

06:45.900 --> 06:51.260
I graduated high school she had had a baby and my mom was like she had a teenage daughter with her

06:51.260 --> 07:03.020
and I was like that baby grew up well I stayed in contact with my favorite teacher after I

07:03.020 --> 07:08.700
graduated and we were friends on Facebook and chatted for a while and she sadly passed away

07:08.700 --> 07:16.940
a couple of years ago yeah that's hard to hear yeah but she was almost another mother to me

07:17.900 --> 07:25.180
yeah and I bawled when I found out but she was an absolute angel of a human being

07:25.820 --> 07:31.260
and was one of those teachers that truly cared about her students on a different level you know

07:31.260 --> 07:36.380
what I mean mm-hmm I hear you like she invested well it was also the gifted classes but you know

07:36.380 --> 07:40.860
so she didn't have like a whole lot of us at a time but she really invested a lot of effort into

07:40.860 --> 07:48.380
us and and so hats off to the teachers out there in the OLR crowd hats off to you those of you that

07:48.380 --> 07:53.180
are out there making a difference thank thank you for what you do unless you're mean to the kids

07:53.180 --> 07:58.140
but I don't think any of you are I really don't unless you're my sixth grade algebra teacher where

07:58.140 --> 08:02.140
you're kind of cool dude but you're also kind of a dick or my high school biology teacher who is

08:02.140 --> 08:07.260
who is not a pleasant person but you know what we're not gonna let one bad egg ruin the entire

08:07.260 --> 08:11.980
you know whatever whatever analogy I was going for though we don't let one ruin it for the the

08:11.980 --> 08:17.020
99 of the great ones the coach Milne was really cool he was my chemistry teacher and I'm friends

08:17.020 --> 08:23.260

all right um and literally nobody in chat is trying to jump in with an answer there

11:44.780 --> 11:49.580
although sia tabiri says the girl who played penny in hairspray live yes that is true

11:49.580 --> 11:55.900

11:55.900 --> 12:02.140
ding gold star you get a gold star for the correct answer because of fortnight yes okay so there's an

12:02.140 --> 12:07.260
ariana grande cross fortnight thing going on so you can actually yeah we talked about it on the

12:07.260 --> 12:11.820
show we did we did we talked about the skin on the show last week yes and how it's unfortunate

12:11.820 --> 12:18.300
that she doesn't say yeah every time that the pickaxe is used but there was an upcoming concert

12:18.300 --> 12:24.060
that was scheduled in fortnight right that is the news this week i wanted to talk about that concert

12:24.060 --> 12:30.300
in fortnight um i did not go in the actual game but thanks to the magic of everybody streaming

12:30.300 --> 12:34.380
everything on twitch now and youtube and things like that i was able to consume the content that

12:34.380 --> 12:42.140
way and i'm gonna tell you guys it was not what i expected whatsoever has anybody ever gone to a

12:42.140 --> 12:47.420
concert in a video game like i know fantasy star online has done them a couple times um i feel

12:47.420 --> 12:52.700
like other mmos like maybe uh like uh warcraft even did them but i feel like i went to a tour

12:52.700 --> 12:57.580
and chieftain thing in warcraft back in the day i'm talking back in ragnarok we used to harass like

12:57.580 --> 13:04.220
a a bard or the dancers yeah yeah oh yeah the mock concerts like in uh that that happened in

13:04.220 --> 13:10.460
ever quest that you're ragnarok every game that had bar now it's huge in final fantasy 14 yes

13:10.460 --> 13:14.940
and usually that involves a bunch of characters up on a stage and like everybody is kind of down

13:14.940 --> 13:20.940
below just kind of role-playing right in fact i was um i was actually playing 14 with um shane

13:20.940 --> 13:25.420
last night and i was telling him about this and how i thought it was very interesting and he was

13:25.420 --> 13:29.500
kind of like have you ever gone to the thing in fantasy star online because it's just they're up

13:29.500 --> 13:33.500
on a stage and you're down below it's not that interesting and i think that's what many people

13:33.500 --> 13:37.660
thought this was going to be in fortnite and i'm here to tell the other concerts that they've had

13:37.660 --> 13:42.460
there have been like that i'm here to tell you something changed here i don't know if it's

13:42.460 --> 13:51.100
because of of the power that ariana grande has the impact the uh the numbers the cultural iconery

13:51.100 --> 13:59.020
of ariana grande or what it is but it was not that in fact i found the concert experience to

13:59.020 --> 14:04.700
be kind of an artistic experience and it's something very interesting for video games

14:04.700 --> 14:10.700
and that's why i wanted to bring it up so what happened the concert was only about 12 minutes

14:10.700 --> 14:16.060
um obviously i can't show it to you here because some of the audio would get into dmca issues and

14:16.060 --> 14:20.460
i don't even know the visuals might but so just and plus we're a podcast anyway i don't want the

14:20.460 --> 14:24.860
folks listening on the podcast feed to feel left out so i would encourage you go look up you know

14:24.860 --> 14:29.740
a video of what was going on with this thing and basically what happened there was a whole like um

14:29.740 --> 14:33.580
it was like kind of like an experience type of thing your car so it's all run in the fortnite

14:33.580 --> 14:38.380
engine but your characters get teleported to these scenes that kind of go with some of the

14:38.380 --> 14:42.140
different songs that are playing like before ariana comes out there's one where you're kind of

14:42.140 --> 14:46.540
like bouncing around on some different flowers you know in the scene or whatever and then there's

14:46.540 --> 14:51.180
another one where you go into a mini game where you're like shooting planes and stuff like that

14:51.180 --> 14:56.620
and you're like on the plane and then everybody kind of like crashes i don't know and you have

14:56.620 --> 15:02.700
to like revive people and that's when ariana comes out and she she also is like kind of like revived

15:02.700 --> 15:09.020
and she starts singing um yeah players are strapped into planes and then there was a whole sequence

15:09.020 --> 15:14.940
where there was a what they're calling mc escher kind of like stairs and pillars where um she's

15:14.940 --> 15:19.100
kind of slowly walking up the stairs and she has this big hammer and she's singing one of her

15:19.100 --> 15:26.620
songs she's actually singing the duet she did with um mac miller who passed away um a few years ago

15:26.620 --> 15:31.580
and obviously that was very you know tragic for for her um and a lot of people saw that as a

15:31.580 --> 15:37.740
tribute to him like she was climbing up a stairway to like heaven or something to like i don't know

15:37.740 --> 15:42.540
knock on the door or however you want to interpret that the point is this was a very she just went

15:42.620 --> 15:48.220
from zeppelin to dylan this it was a very artistic thing and you know if we're going to continue this

15:48.220 --> 15:53.980
conversation about video games or art i'm here to say i'm just as shocked as anyone else honestly

15:53.980 --> 15:59.420
that fortnite and ariana grande brought us this very artistic kind of really neat thing this past

15:59.420 --> 16:03.900
week i need to find this on youtube or something you really should it and it and again i stress

16:03.900 --> 16:08.620
it has yes the ariana grande skin is in fortnite and you can go play fortnite with that this thing

16:09.340 --> 16:13.420
was none of that this this had nothing to do with fortnite except for the fact that it was

16:13.420 --> 16:17.580
running in the same engine and therefore we had a lot of the same emotes a lot of the same ways to

16:17.580 --> 16:25.180
move around and things like that but it was not a you know one versus 100 type of thing so um

16:26.060 --> 16:31.820
it's really interesting i i i'm curious did anybody in chat actually check this out or see it

16:31.820 --> 16:36.540
and did you kind of take away the same impression i did that like this could be this this is a

16:36.540 --> 16:42.620
really interesting direction for fortnite because i know we've heard in the past like within the

16:42.620 --> 16:47.340
past couple months right like fortnite and i think a lot of this might have come with the epic and

16:47.340 --> 16:52.940
apple thing or whatever whatever whatever we've heard a lot from epic the past few months but i

16:52.940 --> 16:58.460
feel like epic has talked a lot about how they don't see themselves as a game as much as they

16:58.460 --> 17:05.180
see themselves as like a pop culture or a pop and we we were all kind of sitting here going what

17:05.180 --> 17:10.300
it's it's a fucking game it's fortnite like don't like you're not taking yourself like

17:10.300 --> 17:14.940
just accept what you are fortnite and now that i've seen this i'm kind of like oh

17:16.220 --> 17:23.900
i see where they might be trying to go with this like fortnite is the canvas upon which this event

17:23.900 --> 17:31.340
was sort of drawn honestly so um let's see sg100 matt says i didn't and i kind of want to watch the

17:31.340 --> 17:34.700
video for it now yeah check it out it was only like honestly when all said and done it was only

17:34.700 --> 17:39.660
like 14 minutes start to finish like it's not a long concert in the traditional sense it really

17:39.660 --> 17:44.140
felt more like an interactive music video quite honestly because i don't think she was performing

17:44.140 --> 17:48.140
it live or anything like that it really just sounded like it was the studio recordings to

17:48.140 --> 17:54.940
be honest um tiger claw on chat says fortnite is more like a game that's a service i think

17:54.940 --> 18:02.140
yeah that's probably a big part of it as well um let's see uh tryna see uh up in chat as well

18:02.140 --> 18:10.060
interesting sg100 matt says fortnite is more mtv than mtv this is like kind of revolutionary in

18:10.060 --> 18:15.180
terms of music video type of sphere that's what i'm saying that's why this thing kind of took me

18:15.180 --> 18:20.860
by surprise i wasn't expecting it i was expecting ariana grande up on the stage doing some twirls

18:20.860 --> 18:25.580
singing you know maybe either a new recording or something of some of her greatest hits

18:25.580 --> 18:30.540
and then you know but spend twenty dollars on my dlc thank you bye thank you next you know that's

18:31.180 --> 18:38.780
that's it but it wasn't that at all um yeah let's see uh and yyr of course is bringing up the music

18:38.780 --> 18:44.300
game related news here yes ariana grande is also related to the music games and ddr uh ariana

18:44.300 --> 18:50.380
grande was in ddr except break free was cut from ddr last month after being in the game for five

18:50.380 --> 18:56.700
years whoops the licensing ran out that's no fun now that uh now that the game is mandatory to be

18:56.700 --> 19:03.580
online um bobby blackwolf in chat says i've seen some of these music video experiences in the past

19:03.580 --> 19:09.020
but none have been as big as this the chain smokers did a psvr experience for one of their

19:09.020 --> 19:16.780
new singles yeah i saw a psvr thing for i think it was utada hikaru uh they did something for

19:16.780 --> 19:22.460
uh kingdom hearts it was like a live studio show where they were singing um one of the kingdom

19:22.540 --> 19:28.940
heart songs and you could look at it in vr um and i've also seen the literal vr music videos like

19:28.940 --> 19:35.500
i think it was bjork did a vr music video or it was like a youtube 360 like really close type of

19:35.500 --> 19:42.620
thing so it's yeah there have been those experiences but still there was this this felt different than

19:42.620 --> 19:49.100
any of that um is that it really just felt like it was an entire it kind of you know what it it

19:49.100 --> 19:55.660
actually reminds me of i'm gonna throw it way back do you remember on the old school computers

19:55.660 --> 20:00.860
especially the commodore 64 but i'm sure this was done a little bit on apple 2e's and stuff too but

20:00.860 --> 20:05.820
especially the commodore 64 because of the sound chip and the particular unique sound and music

20:05.820 --> 20:13.180
that that did do you remember the demo scene and the demos that would come out bobby i know you're

20:13.180 --> 20:18.540
gonna light up with this i know that was that was your scene when you were younger that's what this

20:18.540 --> 20:24.860
ariana thing reminded me of is that and those those um demo things would be like a like a song

20:24.860 --> 20:29.500
might play and you would see like a it would like push the graphic chips to do something on the

20:29.500 --> 20:34.780
screen and then like maybe a different part of the song it switches a little bit go look up like an

20:34.780 --> 20:40.460
old school like happy holidays commodore 64 compilation or something to see like what

20:40.460 --> 20:44.380
you know it's so show different scenes of the holidays what would play different like um

20:45.340 --> 20:50.620
christmas carols and things like that uh bobby says really it was about the amiga for the demo

20:50.620 --> 20:55.020
scene that's right the amiga really stepped that up even more and bobby points out of course the

20:55.020 --> 21:00.300
pc demos yes that was still a thing even in the 90s and um i think that name is showing up black

21:00.300 --> 21:05.420
on black yes it's jason hi it's our voiceover man jason saying demo scene is still very much alive

21:05.420 --> 21:11.820
as niche as it ever was honest and i i hope nobody hates me for this comment because it's actually

21:11.820 --> 21:18.620
meant to be a compliment the ariana grande concert felt like a mainstream demo scene project

21:19.820 --> 21:27.900
honestly it's honestly what it felt like to me so um jason it might be the way things are set up

21:27.900 --> 21:31.820
on my computer your name is black and it's just i'm on night mode over here so it's coming up on

21:31.820 --> 21:38.060
a black background i wouldn't worry too much about it um let's see zen monkey 11 in chat says i go to

21:38.060 --> 21:43.500
concerts in alt space vr they have holograms in there so you see the real artist in vr in

21:43.500 --> 21:49.180
front of you not on a screen zara larson did a roblox mini concert the metaverse is real and

21:49.180 --> 21:54.380
it's here i'm all for it saw the ariana concert inside of fortnite i try to experience them all

21:54.380 --> 22:01.020
it's cool yeah now that i've seen this one like if another artist does one that i that i like or even

22:01.020 --> 22:07.980
like kind of like like like for i i'm kind of into little nos x right now because i think i

22:07.980 --> 22:13.180
i love how he's pushing people's buttons right now and the music videos and stuff you know it's like

22:13.180 --> 22:20.140
fortnite is more playstation home than playstation home is you know because it could be like this is

22:20.140 --> 22:25.020
like kind of you know you have this world that exists that you put stuff into it like these

22:25.020 --> 22:30.300
different media pieces and stuff whereas if sony were smart they would bring that playstation home

22:30.300 --> 22:36.540
but since they haven't um you have these types of venues now where artists can you can have

22:36.540 --> 22:43.020
different crossovers with artists and properties and all sorts of licensing i didn't even think

22:43.020 --> 22:48.780
about that but you're you're you're you're right on that um cia tabirian chat says i mean i know

22:48.780 --> 22:53.900
there were some stand-up comedians who were doing comedy shows and animal crossing well yeah i mean

22:53.900 --> 22:57.820
especially especially because of the nature of the pandemic and animal crossing really hitting at the

22:57.820 --> 23:06.780
right time i mean the kk concerts are a staple of animal crossing now you know obviously i still

23:06.780 --> 23:12.540
miss him though doing his thing in the um you know in the coffee shop because we need the coffee shop

23:12.540 --> 23:17.580
back yes we do you put that side by side with the ariana thing and it looks a little sad but

23:17.580 --> 23:21.900
i mean it's it's it's still it is what it is for that game and it was kind of like

23:22.540 --> 23:27.580
it warped you out of the traditional world and had that credit sequence you know as basic as

23:27.580 --> 23:33.820
it is it was still something kind of interesting and different um jason our voiceover guy is uh

23:33.820 --> 23:39.100
continuing with a comment about way back in the day beastie boys did a live internet concert back

23:39.100 --> 23:45.820
in the 90s i'm talking like real video era quality and it was just a single camera angle with audio

23:45.820 --> 23:51.340
of course yeah yeah that's that's like a streamed concert type of thing and honestly again i think

23:51.340 --> 23:58.940
that's what a lot of us expected from this but it really was different um you have low-key

23:58.940 --> 24:03.580
playstations missing out from not rebooting home but at the same time playstations really trying

24:03.580 --> 24:08.140
to push itself is like the place you want to be playing fortnite even though fortnite is available

24:08.780 --> 24:13.340
literally everywhere else except you know that that little spat epic has going on right now but

24:13.340 --> 24:17.500
we're gonna we're gonna overlook that it's available a variety of different places than

24:17.500 --> 24:23.580
just in most places most places yes so um st100 matt says i don't think playstation home had

24:23.580 --> 24:28.700
concerts but i feel like there was a watch a long or listen along communities i kind of remember

24:28.700 --> 24:33.260
there was watch longs in the olr house in home but then sony updated the game where no media

24:33.260 --> 24:38.460
could be played at home yeah there was a lot of potential in home that really went unrealized

24:38.460 --> 24:43.820
like i feel like just when home was kind of like finding its rhythm and where it could belong and

24:43.820 --> 24:49.100
really blossom somebody just pulled the plug and like on on like the development front it was like

24:49.100 --> 24:53.740
no we're not spending another dime on trying to make this better or trying to establish some of

24:53.740 --> 24:58.460
the copyright issues or things like that like i really think they just they really yanked that and

24:58.460 --> 25:05.180
now fortnite even though fortnite doesn't really feel like home to me but i i i get that comparison

25:05.180 --> 25:11.580
i get why you're saying that um zeba in chat says synth riders oh yeah that vr game you brought up

25:11.580 --> 25:17.180
in the email has three experience songs that you are inside a vr version of the music video of the

25:17.180 --> 25:22.140
artist much like in the background of ddr oh that sounds neat that sounds kind of interesting it's

25:22.140 --> 25:27.580
different way to do it uh and bonds 006 says i would go back into home i i would absolutely

25:27.580 --> 25:31.900
give home a second chance i'm really surprised they didn't bring it back with the vr i thought

25:31.900 --> 25:36.460
for sure that was something they were gonna do was try to take on the vr chat second life type

25:36.460 --> 25:43.100
of angle but for whatever reason they didn't so um interesting yeah as jonah matt says ps home was

25:43.100 --> 25:48.940
both the butt end of jokes at its time and also way ahead of its time there's things like that

25:48.940 --> 25:57.340
in gaming um that just one versus 100 on xbox i'll say that i'll say that until you pull the plug on

25:57.340 --> 26:02.300
this show that thing was way ahead of its time hell even the things that preceded it and the

26:02.300 --> 26:09.020
berkeley uh games online like acrophobia and stuff like that that was you know that was huge

26:09.020 --> 26:15.180
anyway so we'll see what had any any artists that you would want to see in fortnite with an

26:15.180 --> 26:19.180
interactive visual experience you know i have to ask this what artist do you want to see in

26:19.180 --> 26:24.220
fortnite with an interactive visual experience i feel like i don't listen to a lot of like modern

26:24.220 --> 26:30.300
music so i i i'm going back to what i said earlier like a little nos x because he's really pushing

26:30.300 --> 26:34.780
the buttons with things right now i'd like to see somebody who's kind of known for reinventions

26:34.780 --> 26:41.100
like maybe madonna i'd be very curious um and uh if it's in fortnite she wouldn't need her walker

26:41.100 --> 26:47.500
just kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding come on all right anyway

26:47.500 --> 26:53.980
uh oh gaga of course who who wouldn't who wouldn't go to a gaga concert even this even the straight

26:53.980 --> 26:58.700
people would want to see a gaga concert in fortnite because she's a heck of a performer

26:58.700 --> 27:04.380
that would be really great uh any any oh oh i like that answer sg100 matt says daft punk

27:04.380 --> 27:08.540
but they're broken up and i feel like they did one over already well hell if they ever reunited

27:09.100 --> 27:13.900
that would be a heck of a thing to do that's for sure any any thoughts on on a fortnite experience

27:13.900 --> 27:19.260
dark soccer or loki yeah i have two widely different things okay go for it oh well good

27:19.260 --> 27:24.300
okay go would be interesting because they do like their uh seamless videos and stuff it's pretty

27:24.380 --> 27:28.620
interesting makes it a completely separate side of the spectrum death lock

27:31.500 --> 27:37.100
all right i i'm all for a guar concert in fortnite let's see that happen

27:38.460 --> 27:47.100
dark dark soccer how about you i want a gorillas one gorillas of course oh god the bands that are

27:47.100 --> 27:52.220
kind of technically inclined to begin with that makes a lot of exactly that are animated to begin

27:52.220 --> 27:56.300
with yeah yeah absolutely why i kind of you know why i say tech inclined because there's a lot of

27:56.300 --> 28:02.380
tech that goes into the concerts and stuff like that that's a great answer um Hatsune Miku why not

28:02.380 --> 28:07.900
also that i think has been done you're right i think that has been done uh bobby bobby blackwolf

28:07.900 --> 28:12.140
says the tupac hologram in fortnite which was similar i think that could be dangerous

28:12.940 --> 28:20.060
um orange right says a weirdo concert fuck yes oh you know weirdo would do it hell yes i love it

28:20.780 --> 28:26.940
all right win-win all right let's move on since my co-host did not attend the concert in fortnite

28:26.940 --> 28:31.100
but to be fair neither did i i watched it uh i watched a wrap-up summary just because i was

28:31.100 --> 28:35.180
curious and everybody on social media was saying it was great and i was like i have to see what

28:35.180 --> 28:39.500
was so great about it and then i watched it i was like oh this is not what i was expecting at all

28:39.500 --> 28:44.620
so um we were playing video games and too busy not to go to virtual concerts so what kind of

28:44.620 --> 28:48.300
video games have you been playing this week we'll start with dark sakura how was your gaming week

28:48.940 --> 28:53.100
i played dead by daylight of course you did you played you were playing i beat

28:53.100 --> 28:59.580
phantasian you were playing at one in the morning this morning dead by day well because my um

29:00.460 --> 29:09.020
my stream time for uh i actually go live at midnight now after such this early sunday and uh

29:10.700 --> 29:17.580
i mean i just play until like maybe 2 33 in the morning um i had some good people in last night

29:17.580 --> 29:21.420
actually got a raid like right before i was about to sign off i don't know why happens it

29:21.420 --> 29:25.980
i'm on my last game and people raid me and it's all good it's always happens to me too

29:26.540 --> 29:31.180
so i played another round that i didn't do as great in but i made rank 13 last night which

29:31.180 --> 29:36.780
for me is a big deal because i always feel like i completely suck at the game but i'm pretty okay

29:36.780 --> 29:43.660
with pig so i like pig i think you it is you i was just gonna say you called it out on your stream

29:43.660 --> 29:48.300
when i was watching it's it's it's the fact that you have to kind of use a trackball i think kind

29:48.300 --> 29:53.900
of like you're not able to be as fluid as some in some motions or at least you're working up to that

29:53.900 --> 29:59.500
still and i think once that kind of gets a little more and i think you're only your pig game i

29:59.500 --> 30:05.180
watched last night games actually were way improved from what i'd seen back in the when

30:05.180 --> 30:10.860
you first started so i mean i was whipping stuff but i was also super super tired when i was

30:10.860 --> 30:20.380
playing but um i figured out my way of countering you know the upfront 360 and i don't know if you

30:20.380 --> 30:28.300
noticed that i was doing this but i would chase get close and stop because at the point that i

30:28.300 --> 30:33.500
know that 360 is about to happen they will just turn and run right into me because i stopped

30:35.420 --> 30:40.300
that's like a nurse that teleports like they start their teleport and then as soon as the

30:40.300 --> 30:44.380
survivor runs around they teleport into the ground so that they don't actually move forward

30:44.380 --> 30:49.100
it's kind of a similar thing yeah i i did actually get the idea from watching lc

30:50.300 --> 30:58.620
and our uh our everyone's favorite you know nurse one trick but uh i got the idea watching and then

30:58.620 --> 31:06.940
i was thinking i can't turn that quickly with the trackball but why don't i just stop i've never

31:06.940 --> 31:13.660
seen anyone do that except playing nurse so i was like why don't i just stop i think that's

31:13.660 --> 31:18.140
clever i think the more you find those workarounds that are unexpected the more you're going to see

31:18.140 --> 31:23.180
the rewards that come from that yeah no one expects you to stop like i actually got a

31:23.180 --> 31:31.020
compliment on it from a jake player the other day um it was one of my uh offline games and

31:31.020 --> 31:35.820
he was he was like you're the first killer i've ever seen just stop and let me run into you

31:37.100 --> 31:40.940
and i was like well i have to use a thumb trackball because i have bad wrists we were

31:40.940 --> 31:44.620
just chatting about it and he's like also are you a microsoft star like no i'm on stadia because i

31:44.620 --> 31:49.340
play on a mac and so we got into a little discussion about it and like in that match

31:49.340 --> 31:56.860
like he was like rake four and we started talking about it and he just flat out said hey i'm gonna

31:56.860 --> 32:04.220
i'm gonna borrow this idea for my killer games there you go i was like cool i'm glad i'm glad

32:04.220 --> 32:09.420
to be of service but um and i've actually started talking through like some of my thought processes

32:09.420 --> 32:15.020
while i play and why i do the things that i do and talking it out and getting advice from people in

32:15.020 --> 32:21.020
my chat really i think helped me do better and i've also had my builds look at looked at by

32:21.020 --> 32:27.340
a few players that i trust so i've gotten some really good advice and i want to actually give

32:27.340 --> 32:34.780
a thank you to to lc to hydro to nick and prince uh a few people out there who's given uh laurie

32:34.780 --> 32:41.180
bird gave me really good advice on my builds nice and i'm also playing wordscapes because i'm a word

32:41.180 --> 32:50.780
nerd a word nerd all right loki how was your gaming week or weeks as it is uh well it was

32:50.780 --> 32:59.260
all minecraft um so it was i don't know it was a lot of just like kind of grinding to get stuff

32:59.260 --> 33:05.660
done and um i was doing a lot of i was cutting some videos together so like i did a tutorial

33:05.660 --> 33:10.540
video i think last week maybe it was this week i don't know everything's starting to blend together

33:10.540 --> 33:16.220
um so i did tutorial video to try to drive some more views to my channel so i put that out and

33:16.220 --> 33:20.540
and that was pretty successful because there was um it was all about timing because there was an

33:20.540 --> 33:26.380
episode that bdubs had done on hermitcraft where he did a two in one like stone generator and i'm

33:26.380 --> 33:31.340
like i bet i can make that three in one stone generator because um it should be pretty easy

33:31.340 --> 33:38.220
to add uh basalt to it so i did i i put out a design that's based sort of like on his not

33:38.220 --> 33:44.940
exactly the way he did it but like a similar looking design and added that in there so i was

33:44.940 --> 33:51.180
trying to help you know promote myself that way so that it's it's got okay views i mean so it

33:51.180 --> 33:57.340
you know it's working there and then i'm working on my latest episode um pretty soon so in that one

33:57.340 --> 34:04.700
i built this because we have issues on our servers still with mob spawns it's an issue with the

34:04.700 --> 34:10.780
software server runs it's not vanilla minecraft it's like paper which is like a sort of modded

34:10.780 --> 34:17.340
server um it fixes some bugs it also introduces new bugs and so because of that there's a bug

34:17.340 --> 34:23.500
with uh mobs spawning correctly so if i'm on the server by myself or i'm on the server with

34:23.500 --> 34:28.700
somebody else and they're in another dimension for me there's no mobs spawning whatsoever in my

34:28.700 --> 34:36.300
farm so it makes it really hard to run shops on our server and so i had to create a a cash for

34:36.300 --> 34:42.140
gold store to get people to sell me gold so i can use it in my gold farm um and so that was

34:42.140 --> 34:49.020
a fun build i made it look like a rundown you know strip mall store so um so that'll be my new video

34:49.020 --> 34:54.460
and then um yeah so it's been just a lot of that a lot of this week just kind of um

34:56.220 --> 35:00.300
i don't know i don't even know what i've been working on i think a lot of it's just been afk

35:00.300 --> 35:05.500
in in the server oh and then also working on other projects for people on the server as well so

35:05.500 --> 35:10.620
there's some other things um tied with that but i'm trying to get more on track to put out stuff

35:10.620 --> 35:17.020
in a regular basis i mean i have been putting up videos about once a week but it's not my normal

35:17.020 --> 35:23.340
smp let's play stuff it's been kind of you know here and there so still trying to get that down

35:23.340 --> 35:29.660
faster but making progress all right well best of luck on the youtube front make sure make sure

35:29.660 --> 35:36.060
y'all are following loki on youtube at loki olr on youtube yep all right uh my gaming week honestly

35:36.060 --> 35:39.580
i've been playing mostly a lot of the same stuff i've been talking about in previous weeks on the

35:39.580 --> 35:44.620
show uh myself i'm still you know uh moving along in dead by daylight i did a random stream on my

35:44.620 --> 35:49.340
own channel on friday that was that was fun except uh jamie you've expressed this too like when when

35:49.340 --> 35:54.060
the camera's on i have all bad games and then when the camera's off is when i have my good games

35:54.060 --> 35:59.180
although i did i had my one trick bill game um because i had a daily that i had to like get an

35:59.180 --> 36:04.460
item and escape as bill well bill was like level one so i ran i ran i was like screw it let's do

36:04.460 --> 36:12.300
i ran a game with uh bill with one talent uh borrowed time and oh billiam i did it i i i

36:12.300 --> 36:15.580
opened the exit door and escaped that was not the item and escape it was the exit door to scare i

36:15.580 --> 36:19.500
opened the exit door and escaped so uh yeah and it was funny because when that happened it was

36:19.500 --> 36:23.900
pod culture somebody started spamming that icon from your channel with the the bill with the slash

36:23.900 --> 36:30.620
through it i'm like hey you mean the one that i'm doing right now yes in chat so yeah there's that

36:30.620 --> 36:36.780
um i was playing some fun fast c14 last night uh yakuza like a dragon i kind of hit a wall

36:36.780 --> 36:40.700
uh those of you that played the game i hit that three million yen wall you all know what i'm

36:40.700 --> 36:45.900
talking about um and uh so it's it slowed me down a little bit but i am gonna try to uh pick that

36:45.900 --> 36:50.620
up because i'm too close to finishing it and too invested in the story to not finish it um

36:50.860 --> 36:55.420
i also just some random new stuff was showing up on game pass i was like oh i want to play that

36:55.420 --> 37:02.300
again so for example luminous is on game pass now i love luminous i know it's so good it's the

37:02.300 --> 37:06.220
remastered version of the original so it has shine in which is like you know the best one of the best

37:06.220 --> 37:11.420
songs i've ever had in that game you mean the best song what well there was a holla back girl

37:11.420 --> 37:15.740
and luminous too let's not get crazy all right here's the thing that pissed me off though you

37:16.620 --> 37:23.500
know how you have to get to level 100 to um basically beat the normal i got to level 94

37:23.500 --> 37:29.500
it took me an hour to get there and then i choked i was so mad but i'll just have to play it again

37:29.500 --> 37:34.860
um katamari damashi reroll is also on game pass i downloaded it but i haven't played that yet so

37:34.860 --> 37:39.260
that's all i can really say about that right now but here's the new thing i want to talk about that

37:39.260 --> 37:44.140
i actually tried this week um that is kind of interesting so i out of the blue got a message

37:44.140 --> 37:51.580
on my xbox inbox that said you're invited to test out the xcloud service at xbox.com slash play

37:52.460 --> 37:57.340
so uh i did and i'm giving you that url because it's uh it's pretty one easy one to remember and

37:57.340 --> 38:03.180
maybe you have it you don't know it so check it out um and so i went to um check it out and it's

38:03.180 --> 38:07.100
based it is their cloud-based service it's basically their stadia okay but it's it's in

38:07.100 --> 38:13.820
the xbox environment um and if you have game pass then you can just fire up any of the game pass

38:13.820 --> 38:19.340
games on there otherwise you can fire up um things that i i think i think it might only be

38:19.340 --> 38:23.260
game pass games but i can't remember if it's things that you own in the cloud but it's only

38:23.260 --> 38:30.220
certain games that have the permission which i think mostly overlaps with um uh uh game pass

38:30.220 --> 38:35.820
uh mike defton chat says uh welcome to the xcloud gang rob i barely use it i had to try it out i

38:35.820 --> 38:41.020
wanted to see so the first game i played of course was no man's sky because i feel like that is a

38:41.020 --> 38:46.140
good benchmark game for me a i've played a fucking lot of it b i've played it on pretty much every

38:46.140 --> 38:55.020
platform no i i i'm not i've played it playstation 4 playstation vr xbox 360 xbox one xbox series i'm

38:55.020 --> 39:00.780
sorry not the 360 what am i saying the xbox one the xbox series x uh steam i've played that game

39:00.780 --> 39:06.540
a lot of different places um i played that on the invidious thing too so i played it on xcloud a

39:06.540 --> 39:15.420
little bit um and it was i would say it was um it was fine but i think stadia might be a little more

39:15.420 --> 39:21.500
responsive i think the technology might be a little bit crisper on stadia i don't know if

39:21.500 --> 39:28.540
it's just that they've had more time to perfect it or whatever the case is um but um i it wasn't

39:28.540 --> 39:33.580
bad by any means it's just i would notice the artifacting a little more and especially when i

39:33.580 --> 39:39.820
was turning in these heavily graphical areas like my game save was on the um the anomaly which is a

39:39.820 --> 39:45.740
pretty graphically intensive area i could notice like it did seem to lag a little bit so um but but

39:45.740 --> 39:50.700
it wasn't like it didn't make the game unplayable by any means but i i think for that particular

39:50.700 --> 39:56.940
game i would just continue to play my xbox series x version why wouldn't i but the other game i

39:56.940 --> 40:04.460
played i played doom the 2016 reboot um and again i did notice some of the stuff with the artifacting

40:04.460 --> 40:10.140
and maybe some of the colors weren't quite as vibrant but i did definitely notice it was

40:10.140 --> 40:16.300
streaming 60 frames a second and it was smooth and especially a game like that doom which is

40:16.300 --> 40:21.740
very fast pace like it actually went a little bit through the first level to kind of get a feel for

40:21.740 --> 40:27.820
it and i was kind of like this does play really well for like a cloud-based thing so although i

40:27.820 --> 40:32.700
would say in my evaluation this the stadia technology was a little bit ahead of where

40:32.700 --> 40:38.700
xbox was at i still think it's really exciting it's not bad by any means and i think where this

40:38.700 --> 40:45.020
is really going to shine is being able to test games before you spend like 80 gigs downloading

40:45.020 --> 40:51.100
them because you know that doom reboot is like a 40 gig downloader maybe 50 i don't even more

40:51.100 --> 40:55.580
well why not stream a little bit and sure streaming is going to take up bandwidth too

40:55.580 --> 40:59.900
but streaming for 15 30 minutes is only going to be it's not going to be a like even a gig

40:59.900 --> 41:03.180
you know to test the game a little bit out and see what you think about it and then make a decision

41:03.180 --> 41:08.380
from there and i think it's also great for these things where it's like uh sometimes in the xbox

41:08.380 --> 41:12.940
rewards it's like you need to get an achievement in one of these 10 games and i'm like i don't want

41:12.940 --> 41:17.980
to download one of those 10 games now i could just do it through the cloud gaming so i'm really

41:17.980 --> 41:22.700
excited too to see what happens when the cloud gaming hits the actual xbox series x i think

41:22.700 --> 41:29.820
that will be very very interesting um as 100 matt says i also got that invite as well i look forward

41:29.820 --> 41:34.540
to trying it out at some point yeah why not try it out you got it um especially if you have game

41:34.540 --> 41:39.580
pass you just are going to have all those games already ready to try out so why not um i have not

41:39.580 --> 41:45.500
tried it on my phone yet it is supposed to work in safari or um uh google chrome or whatever

41:45.580 --> 41:50.860
depending on what what you got uh it but i just haven't tried it on my phone yet um let's see

41:51.500 --> 41:57.180
uh jason and chad says 80 gigs ha call of duty has already eclipsed 200 call of duty was not

41:57.180 --> 42:01.580
one of the games um grant that no i don't think grant that on five was in the cloud

42:01.580 --> 42:08.460
no uh i don't i don't think so i thought i saw streaming yeah um paitlin hanumea says i got two

42:08.460 --> 42:12.860
platinums in no man's sky one for playstation 4 and when i installed it on playstation 5 it gave

42:12.860 --> 42:17.340
me a second yeah a lot of people are having that interesting over that flight simulator on there

42:17.900 --> 42:22.140
no which surprise or at least i don't remember seeing it i don't want to definitively say that

42:22.140 --> 42:27.500
i didn't notice it um i mean that would be worth it because that downloads probably yes it's a huge

42:27.500 --> 42:33.820
download but i also think see flight simulator is one of those where i'm like i think it's better

42:33.820 --> 42:39.900
if you download it because the 4k visuals are stunning and until they can uh get the cloud

42:39.900 --> 42:48.140
gaming at 4k uh i think i think it's it's worth the download but that's me um yyr in chat says

42:48.140 --> 42:53.260
omg rob you are a genius i've been downloading extra games just to finish those damn weekly class

42:53.980 --> 42:59.740
quests launching them via xcloud is so much smarter thank you ego inflate thank you ego

42:59.740 --> 43:06.380
plus plus you inflated rob's ego it's super effective thanks why we are good luck uh and

43:06.380 --> 43:13.580
bobby says i think exactly um bobby blackwolf says i think flight simulator is coming later

43:13.580 --> 43:19.340
because they're still upgrading x cloud xbox series x right now it's all on xbox one oh that's

43:19.340 --> 43:23.980
a i forgot about that thank you oh i'm very curious to see what happens get the old fight

43:23.980 --> 43:30.060
simulator then like the emulate that old ass one from like the pcs in 1988 we'll do flight

43:30.060 --> 43:35.660
simulator one how about that i think that can that can work right i think i saw a skin in the store

43:35.660 --> 43:39.900
where you could do or maybe that's just for the little computer on the plane i don't remember but

43:41.020 --> 43:47.660
a flight sim and run flight sim in flight sims yeah that sounds fun why not i think the the

43:47.660 --> 43:53.500
crazy thing about flight simulator the some of the shit in the store is why would i ever buy this

43:53.500 --> 43:59.420
there's things where it's like download the improved uh airport in whatever city in germany

43:59.420 --> 44:07.580
for fifteen dollars what i'm gonna say fifteen dollars on fucking airport dlc like i have to be

44:07.580 --> 44:11.580
super serious about my flight sim to spend that kind of money i'm sure there's someone out there

44:11.580 --> 44:18.300
that drops it hey you spent your money on whatever you want but for me i was like what the fuck that

44:18.300 --> 44:25.820
is way too much money for something like that s2100 matt says zaku would get that dlc i don't

44:25.900 --> 44:30.380
even i i need the man to speak for himself i don't even know zaku would get that dlc that's

44:30.380 --> 44:37.820
like some of the planes for a couple extra bucks i get that an airport for that much money no

44:38.700 --> 44:43.740
anyway that was my experience with xcloud i'm looking forward to seeing how it continues

44:43.740 --> 44:47.500
can't wait to stream from my own xbox because apparently that will be a thing that's coming

44:47.500 --> 44:54.780
in the future very exciting um and uh i i will say dead by daylight was a game i almost tested

44:54.780 --> 44:59.660
um but i was kind of like if i'm gonna play dead by daylight on my pc why wouldn't i just play the

44:59.660 --> 45:05.340
steam steam version that i already have on here but it is there all right well you know why i'm

45:05.340 --> 45:11.660
playing on what i am because the steam one yeah yeah but um yeah yeah if they ever i really hope

45:11.660 --> 45:16.060
they get that cross play working across more platforms that would be lovely we'll see all

45:16.060 --> 45:21.100
right we're gonna get back into some more news and uh we'll start it off with oh i guess i should do

45:21.100 --> 45:26.620
some quick housekeeping um right now as actually no i'm i'm confident saying this so there will

45:26.620 --> 45:33.900
not be a show in one two three four weeks uh labor day weekend there will not be a show i will not be

45:33.900 --> 45:39.500
here um right now my agenda has me going to dragon con i'm hearing rumors and rumblings that could be

45:39.500 --> 45:45.740
uh maybe not a thing even if they do not end up having dragon con i'm still taking a vacation

45:45.740 --> 45:50.060
um i've been working way too hard over the past year and a half i deserve a vacation i'm taking

45:50.060 --> 45:56.540
a vacation uh i don't really want to live in the space of negativity so i'm not gonna list out my

45:56.540 --> 46:01.340
different options of what i'm going to do if there isn't a con but i'm thinking about it and there's

46:01.340 --> 46:05.500
lots of ideas right now so we will see but there will not be an olr that week because i'm not going

46:05.500 --> 46:12.780
to be here uh one way or the other so that's that um all right otherwise let's move on we have so

46:12.780 --> 46:18.380
but if there if there is a dragon con and you feel up to coming i i get it's a weird year let

46:18.380 --> 46:22.460
me know if you're gonna be there i have a lot of panels be great to see you all right let's move

46:22.460 --> 46:28.700
on we got a lot of news uh in fact we have this story um again this week but some important

46:28.700 --> 46:35.420
developments on the activision blizzard front loki start us off yeah so blizzard president

46:35.420 --> 46:44.940
j alan brack is stepping down um good no basically uh you know he was one of the two people that were

46:44.940 --> 46:52.460
mentioned by name in the um allegations in the first place so it makes sense that he would do

46:52.460 --> 46:59.100
that since you know there's probably going to be some uh stuff coming out about that so he is

46:59.100 --> 47:08.860
stepping down he's being replaced by um jen o'neill and mike gabara and then also apparently along

47:08.860 --> 47:14.620
with you know all of this kind of all these statements from the company that we're hearing

47:14.620 --> 47:21.660
about how you know oh yeah we're addressing the you know the issues and stuff like that but

47:21.660 --> 47:26.060
coming from the actual employees themselves and not leadership we're hearing that it's actually

47:26.060 --> 47:32.620
not really happening the way that leadership is saying basically saying that um you know

47:33.580 --> 47:42.380
there's no no no comment on paid transparency you ignore our calls to end mandatory arbitration you

47:42.380 --> 47:48.540
didn't commit to adopting inclusive recruitment and hiring practices um so all these solutions

47:48.540 --> 47:53.420
basically that you proposed you're not really addressing any of them or any of the solutions

47:53.420 --> 47:57.660
that they propose so it doesn't sound like change is going to be coming anytime soon

47:58.300 --> 48:04.460
um so we'll just have to see how this all plays out well for what it's worth and i i i want to

48:04.460 --> 48:10.060
just start off by saying i completely agree and support that the employee demands need to be

48:10.060 --> 48:15.980
listened to and they need to be responded to and that needs to happen however i think the first

48:15.980 --> 48:23.660
thing that had to happen for any of this to happen is j alan brock had to go so the first the this

48:23.660 --> 48:29.340
this was the first step it's a step but it's not the finish this not the finish of the last

48:29.340 --> 48:35.180
of the story um we all know he had to go he knew he had to go i guess i don't they don't really

48:35.180 --> 48:41.500
say if he opted into it or they they uh it doesn't really fucking matter honestly he's gone um and

48:41.500 --> 48:48.140
that was the important first step um i think the selections of this the i guess successor temporary

48:48.140 --> 48:56.060
successors is interesting uh mostly because uh mike was with xbox and i know we got a lot of

48:56.060 --> 49:02.780
pr stuff from him out of xbox a lot of quotes because i i always would joke because mike deft

49:02.780 --> 49:08.300
has a very very similar name and so i would always laugh like you know oh act deft at the time you're

49:08.300 --> 49:15.820
in the news again you know talking about xbox um so it's i i the we know that he has a familiarity

49:15.900 --> 49:22.620
certainly with the um pr stuff uh jen she come i think that is very interesting because she comes

49:22.620 --> 49:31.180
from vicarious visions who blizzard just acquired not that long ago so that is very much a sign of

49:31.740 --> 49:36.140
we're willing to take this culture in a different direction because she hasn't been a part of

49:36.140 --> 49:41.820
blizzard's culture as long but i again i think that's a good thing um and obviously vicarious

49:41.820 --> 49:47.500
visions have been doing a lot of things right um so i think i think it's interesting um i don't

49:47.500 --> 49:53.500
i don't know if ultimately it will be one of them or maybe another outside party ends up coming in

49:53.500 --> 49:58.620
to lead a ceo or what but i think it's an interesting um partnership so that's that's for

49:58.620 --> 50:06.860
sure um sj100 matt chat says the svp of hr also left this week which also needed to happen yes

50:06.860 --> 50:14.220
i'd heard about that as well uh yes considering hr all of this happened under hr's watch

50:14.860 --> 50:23.100
absolutely that individual had to go as well so see you later um who's next uh what what

50:23.100 --> 50:27.500
was her name we brought up last week fran town said i'm hoping i got that name oh she needs to

50:27.500 --> 50:36.540
go she's i heard she resigned from that council so like i i don't know that's not resigning from

50:36.540 --> 50:41.980
the company which i think is what we would like to see but we're seeing movement we're seeing

50:41.980 --> 50:47.900
movement yeah oh thank you quest buster thank you francis towns and also stepped down from the abk

50:47.900 --> 50:54.300
women's network but she's still in her executive position for now so we'll see what happens um in

50:54.300 --> 51:01.420
the coming coming days she just needs to absolutely go i didn't know that either sj100 matt says she

51:01.420 --> 51:10.460
deactivated her twitter too well she made some good less garbage on twitter ah so yeah um i i'm

51:10.460 --> 51:14.620
really glad though we are talking about you know we're still kind of putting and i think for those

51:14.620 --> 51:19.020
that um want to support what's happening and i think it's it's very interesting that i think

51:19.020 --> 51:25.500
a lot of people have realized that like a boycott isn't really the path maybe for i mean at the end

51:25.500 --> 51:28.700
of the day you need to do what's comfortable for you and if a boycott's what's comfortable for you

51:28.700 --> 51:33.020
that's fine but i think there's a lot of people that realize there's a lot of great people at

51:33.020 --> 51:39.180
abk that want to continue to support the you know those people the majority of the people who are

51:39.180 --> 51:46.380
really great people um and uh i think the best thing we can all do is continue to uplift these

51:46.380 --> 51:53.660
voices our retweets our reminders that hey just because j alan brack took the fall for a lot of

51:53.660 --> 52:00.380
this stuff doesn't mean that it's over because this poison was uh in a lot of places in the

52:00.380 --> 52:06.380
culture and so a lot of these other things have to change so that this doesn't happen again we

52:06.380 --> 52:11.500
have to continue to uplift that message need to pump their stomach and get rid of all the bile

52:12.460 --> 52:20.540
yes absolutely so uh yeah um i suppose we'll see what happens in the coming weeks i

52:21.180 --> 52:24.620
again don't think this is the last we're going to hear this this is three weeks in a row now

52:24.620 --> 52:28.620
and i i think this is a story we're going to hear about honestly every week until at least

52:28.620 --> 52:34.940
the end of the year so we'll see where this continues to go um anything else on that loki

52:34.940 --> 52:38.700
did we get everything well i was gonna say you know it's good that we're talking about it with

52:38.700 --> 52:44.460
you know activision and stuff but i would hope that we'd also not forget that ubisoft is also

52:44.460 --> 52:49.420
covering up for these types of people as well so i need to put the pressure on everybody

52:49.420 --> 52:55.180
and hey in the ea just because we're not talking about you right now don't think that you're out

52:55.180 --> 53:00.780
of this either because i i'm willing to bet this culture is everywhere we have not forgotten 100

53:00.780 --> 53:05.260
fair call out this culture is everywhere within the tech industry and i know i've said this before

53:05.260 --> 53:09.660
on the show and i'll say it again every company should be evaluating these sorts of things right

53:09.660 --> 53:14.860
now especially in the tech industry you know this this should be the wake-up call every company

53:14.860 --> 53:21.500
needs to find this poison within its culture and as dark sakura said initiate emergency procedures

53:21.500 --> 53:28.060
to get rid of the bile pump the stomach pump the stomach so yeah mike deft is saying riot

53:28.060 --> 53:35.180
so many companies in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network absolutely so um yeah and a great

53:35.180 --> 53:41.020
call out loki this is ubisoft is not off the hook just because the spotlight's on abk right now

53:41.020 --> 53:45.260
and i think with a lot of these call outs and things you know especially if you if if we don't

53:45.260 --> 53:49.340
see the management really deliver on these promises i think it's going to get us closer

53:49.340 --> 53:53.580
and closer to where we all have thought the employees of the industry have needed to be

53:53.580 --> 53:59.260
for a long time now which is a union or at least and like i said in last week's show

53:59.260 --> 54:08.620
a legal support group is kind of like the first step in that capacity so all right anyhow let's

54:08.620 --> 54:14.060
yeah sj100 matt says yeah i'm still surprised eve's at uh ease come on ubisoft still has a job

54:14.060 --> 54:20.860
yeah me too i'll quite honestly so and bonds 006 says music industry film industry media all of

54:20.860 --> 54:24.860
them absolutely but you know what the music industry and the film industry have at least

54:24.860 --> 54:33.580
unions yeah there's that so anyway since loki brought up ea let's talk about ea but it's

54:33.580 --> 54:37.420
completely different type of topic we're going to talk about boring financial reports but um

54:38.140 --> 54:41.820
kind of something interesting because a lot of companies have been reporting financial results

54:41.820 --> 54:47.260
this week and ea is certainly one of them as well um so obviously what we just talked about has not

54:47.260 --> 54:52.540
been in the news for ea so hopefully internally they are looking at it um it certainly did not

54:52.540 --> 54:56.700
come up on their earnings call at least to my knowledge uh if they said a quick sentence or

54:56.700 --> 55:01.740
two about it it did not cross my radar but what they did talk about i know of was uh their

55:01.820 --> 55:07.500
financial year and and and how things are holding up there so ceo andrew wilson of ea and the report

55:07.500 --> 55:11.580
said it was a strong start to the fiscal year with our incredible teams delivering experiences

55:11.580 --> 55:16.220
that continue to bring hundreds of millions of players together uh our expanding ea sports

55:16.220 --> 55:23.420
portfolio uh apex legends battlefield 2042 and our leading live services were set to deliver

55:23.420 --> 55:29.180
more great games and contents to players this year um what i think is interesting is when the cfo

55:29.740 --> 55:36.860
blake yorgensen uh started to talk a little bit about f1 2021 which was codemasters first release

55:36.860 --> 55:41.660
under ea because you know ea bought codemasters not that long ago so we had kind of the first

55:41.660 --> 55:47.660
release it's and this is a quote from the cfo it's to the testament of an exceptional game

55:47.660 --> 55:51.020
development team that was able to produce the right assets to produce the right marketing

55:51.020 --> 55:55.580
materials to help us drive this business and the team's working together and you know what i think

55:55.580 --> 56:00.860
we don't get enough credit for that ea is a bunch of people who really can work well together and

56:00.860 --> 56:05.900
we do a great job of working with other parts of our company and when we bring in acquisitions we

56:05.900 --> 56:11.100
work well with them i think the poster child is respawn and you look at what's happened with apex

56:11.100 --> 56:15.500
legends this is a team effort and respawn has obviously driven the amazing development of apex

56:15.500 --> 56:19.660
but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now it's coming up to almost

56:19.660 --> 56:24.140
2 billion in business over two years that's unheard of in our industry and i'm not sure

56:24.140 --> 56:30.140
we get enough credit for it well ea there's a reason why you don't often get credit for

56:30.140 --> 56:41.980
acquisitions if i may pandemic visceral games maxis software westwood studios black box games

56:42.620 --> 56:48.220
play fish mythic entertainment bullfrog what do all those studios have in common

56:48.220 --> 56:58.460
ea bought and closed them so that is why ea you don't get a lot of credit when it comes to the

56:58.460 --> 57:02.460
acquisitions and things like that in fact people are kind of wary of you when it comes to that

57:02.460 --> 57:06.220
that is going to be a trust that's going to take you a long time to earn back congratulations on

57:06.220 --> 57:11.820
the success of apex though respawn really did do a great job yes yeah clap hello let's celebrate

57:11.820 --> 57:18.780
that yes apex is a great game what did ea do to do for that okay i guess they they put money to

57:18.780 --> 57:25.020
advertise it a little bit more and maybe you know invest in a little bit fine you get you get you

57:25.020 --> 57:31.340
get a gold piece of um glitter that is that's that's the new award here when you did something

57:31.340 --> 57:37.260
so minuscule fine we'll acknowledge it congrats ea you get the gold piece of glitter for your success

57:37.820 --> 57:40.220
you you did the bare minimum huzzah

57:42.940 --> 57:48.300
thank you for doing what was expected of you but you know who gets the gold star

57:48.300 --> 57:54.140
respawn studios sure you can have a gold star too dark but but respawn really gets the credit there

57:54.140 --> 57:59.100
because again you know look at the stuff that ea still owns and i you know even if i want to be

57:59.100 --> 58:03.340
you know i would say a smart ass but i'm really just speaking the truth when it comes to those

58:03.340 --> 58:07.820
closed studios i would even say look at ea's partnership with clump companies like bioware

58:09.260 --> 58:15.500
um i don't think that's been a great partnership no it hasn't massive Andromeda thinks that has

58:15.500 --> 58:29.180
not been a great partnership in my opinion anyway it's it's been it's been how very uh bonds 006 and

58:29.180 --> 58:36.540
chat says when i hear or cea i expect loot boxes yeah but i mean i guess that's part of where some

58:36.540 --> 58:40.380
of their but essentially they didn't name star wars and any of that stuff in their financials

58:40.380 --> 58:44.380
but i guess that's because it's only related to the news you know in the past few months

58:44.380 --> 58:47.500
and what's really done well for them which of course you would expect you know with the

58:48.220 --> 58:55.020
f1 2021 and so forth uh apex of course is ongoing sure they're gonna um have some announcements of

58:55.020 --> 58:59.580
the things to say there but i just thought that uh that whole thing about you know we should be

58:59.580 --> 59:03.500
celebrated more for what we're doing with acquisitions it's kind of like why don't you

59:03.500 --> 59:08.220
why don't you pull over a little bit here on some of that those comments you know why don't you why

59:08.220 --> 59:13.980
don't you give some of these studios the space they need such as bioware to really make uh

59:14.620 --> 59:20.540
good games when they go on sale day one bug-free experiences then we'll say you're being a good

59:20.540 --> 59:28.060
partner oh also it's not my job to pat you on the back for doing a job you know what i'm giving you

59:28.060 --> 59:32.620
no credit for anything the only credit i'm giving you for is all the terrible things in this

59:32.620 --> 59:38.540
industry that's what you can get credited for ea interesting because one of the worst companies in

59:38.540 --> 59:42.940
the industry bobby blackwolf and chat says and that's where perception is everything ea games

59:42.940 --> 59:47.500
for the past few years haven't had loot boxes yet nobody cares i thought fever still had them

59:47.500 --> 59:52.460
because oh no no no no they they still do they still totally do they have the whole ultimate

59:52.460 --> 59:58.540
team stuff which is loot boxes so yeah they they have had them they just haven't had them in some

59:58.540 --> 01:00:05.660
games like uh like star wars and um trying to think some of the other ones that they had but

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:11.100
yeah they know the the thing is they make so much money from fifa ultimate team that they don't need

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:16.140
to put like loot boxes and everything they still have it in madden um and there's lots of things

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.540
that they kind of fifa just kind of pay for the rest of the company like pretty much at this

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.740
point like it's just really like if it wasn't profitable for the company i mean you wouldn't

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:31.020
have people farming this stuff in giant server warehouse you know with all these playstation

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.620
fours and stuff like that we just had that last week or the week before i remember that yeah

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:41.660
people thought it was bitcoin so like i mean obviously it's incredibly profitable for them

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.140
so like i'm sorry no you're not a little indie studio we're not going to pat you on the back

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.420
because you did a good job and like honestly like this last formula one game was probably developed

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:57.580
before he even acquired codemasters so you get no credit for that i'm sorry like just you get

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:04.780
nothing you lose good day sir uh stirlock in chat says fifa ultimate team is so bad there's a

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:10.060
literal black market no i'm not joking yeah the uh the playstation farm we just alluded to a

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:16.060
little bit ago uh as shown under matt says you get a participation award ea to pin on your fridge

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.220
now take your jukebox it goes even farther back to that remember when they your account got hacked

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:26.060
because of uh and got stolen and people bought you know fifa ultimate team stuff do i it it's

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:30.140
been it's been years yes i understand that but like this thing has been going on for a long

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.500
time like and these these are the guys that wanted you know online passes and stuff like that for

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.620
used games like ea is just an evil company i'm sorry i'm not going to ever forgive you for any

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:46.860
of this stuff you're an evil company and you're always going to be an evil company period you

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:52.780
know what though i'd rather these type of evils than the other evils that have been in the news

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:58.220
hate to say it but obviously in a perfect world you know what it's just different shades of the

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:06.140
rainbow okay of evil that's the rainbow of evil all right let's move on i had an x that i would

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:11.340
call the rainbow of evil but we won't go there all right let's move on and the rainbow of evil

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:17.020
dark soccer it's who i think it is you know which of course you know which which x it is

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:23.900
yeah all right moving on that was a choice i don't want to talk about it moving on

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:32.460
uh next story dark saga well something that probably comes as a surprise to nobody and has

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:40.460
less to do with uh companies actually being terrible is uh the intellivision amico the

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:44.780
the console that a lot of people have been like super excited mitigated about

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:53.500
well it's been delayed again um it was originally supposed to come out in october 2020

01:02:53.500 --> 01:03:00.300
and then it got pushed back to april 2021 and then fall 2021 and now uh this email went out

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:07.420
to those who pre-ordered and it said that it was delayed further with the pre-orders due to arrive

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:14.860
at the end of 2021 um i got that email yeah because you had yours pre-ordered i sure do

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:21.260
yeah it says uh and i'll just read a little bit of the content the team at intellivision has been

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:26.140
working tirelessly to bring amico our family focused entertainment system to eager households

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:32.060
around the world we've grown to a strong and stable company of more than 60 passionate team

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.620
members spanning three continents representing some of the industry's best talent all of us

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:43.980
are extremely excited to share amico with you and going on uh in spite of all these hurdles

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.860
hampering our ability to fill to fill all orders we are focused and determined to deliver pre-ordered

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:53.340
units by the end of the year this will all also allow us more time to optimize our operating

01:03:53.340 --> 01:04:02.700
system for future game development i'm i'm not mad about it so it's it is what it is it is what

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.020
it is and i'm gonna tell you why i'm not mad about it and i'm not and i because it's not a problem

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:12.460
unique to intellivision as a friendly reminder can you walk into target and buy a playstation 5

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:19.020
no no it's been almost a fucking year and you still can't walk into target and get playstation

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:24.620
5 you can't get an xbox series x either or an s you can't walk into target and buy the fucking

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:30.860
console um which is really unheard of in video game history almost a year out so i think that

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:35.980
shows you there's issues there's problems in the supply chain going on nobody can get a fucking

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:41.340
graphics card nobody can get a graphics card without pirating it right now so i'm sorry not

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.620
pirating getting really lucky yeah or yeah congrats like honestly buy a lotto ticket if

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.740
you got a new graphics card because you've got some real luck right now so like you can't look

01:04:51.740 --> 01:05:00.220
at this and say like oh this is an intellivision problem no it's an industry problem did intellivision

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:05.420
maybe set some of their goals a little bit loftier than they should have perhaps but at the

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.580
same time nobody could have predicted what was going to happen in 2020 and is still you know

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:15.740
happening as of now so again as much as we we could all dunk on tommy talarico for you know

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.660
sometimes the way his ego comes off and all that stuff i just don't think this is the appropriate

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:27.900
place to do that this this is just a symptom of a larger industry problem and that's that's what

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:35.740
it is period um uh bobby blackwolf says look at a new car lot same chip shortage is affecting them

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.140
i didn't even think about that but you're right all the chips that go in uh new cars i'm sure

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:46.620
that's pretty uh crazy uh digirama s says rob mid-tier graphic cards are available but they're

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:57.180
double retail prices in stores a 1660 super should not cost 379 4 59 retail um quest buster says

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:01.420
unless amico has the magic ability to build their own fab plants and supply chains they have the

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.540
same problems as everyone else yep dr tsuya says exactly everyone loves to kick tommy while he's

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:11.420
down but in this instance i don't think they're entirely at fault here no there's other places if

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:18.060
you want to dunk on tommy you can do it um i just i think there's other things in this industry that

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:24.460
are needing to be dunked on and i think the fact that tommy talarico hypes up his games look we

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.180
always have those kinds of people in the industry peter molanu was no different than this is no

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:35.340
different than this and there's other people hello remember uh no man's sky before and look y'all i

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:41.500
fucking stan no man's sky i love that game but was it the game that was hyped up when it came out

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.220
we all know the answer to that okay so there are carnival barkers in this industry fine

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:51.500
and i and i've said this on the show before and this is you know what i respect tommy talarico

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:58.620
i think he's a good guy i am very i met my spouse at video games live for the first time in person

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.380
there's a lot i'm personally thankful to tommy talarico for putting together and making happen

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:08.940
i still i can say that and still say but the best business advice i would give them give him is that

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:14.860
he should have more visible faces that represent the intellivision amico than just him there needs

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:20.220
to be more visible pr faces than just him um and i've said that on the show before and i'm saying

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:27.020
it again um because not everybody is buying what tommy's selling and ultimately that's going to be

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:33.500
what kicks the system in the butt if they're not careful um yyr says there are some real issues

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.780
with amico that go way beyond covet or manufacturing problems if you look at their

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.180
recent videos internet posts you see all kinds of red flags in progress videos of games that should

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:46.380
have been done ages ago a rocket's office filled with wastes of backers money and of course tommy

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:51.180
attacking anyone who dares to criticize them hence why i said there needs to be other pr people that

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:56.700
do some of this speaking as far as the other stuff goes well that the time to pay the piper is going

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:07.580
to be coming so yeah we'll see all right moving on let's talk about something else that's getting

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:11.900
a lot of hate mail in the industry this week we touched on this towards the end of last week's

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.940
show but we didn't really dig into it and this story kind of got bigger this week um and so

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:25.420
loki why don't you tell us about this yeah so this is it seems like we were also talking about this

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.860
like at the beginning of the pandemic as well or like somewhat into the pandemic but you know

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:36.780
niantic had removed some of the pokemon go safety measures um despite the fact that we're having

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:43.340
different variants of covet 19 popping up now so you know there is still the risk of transmission

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:51.340
of these new uh variants as well and so uh back in june apparently they had you know started to

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:58.780
roll back some of the double distance tweaks and um some of the other enhancements you know being

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:04.060
added to the game despite the fact that you know some people might not want to leave and also other

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:10.380
parts of the world are having resurgences um in their area um and because of that you know fans

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:15.020
of the game have been kind of you know trying to let them know hey we don't think this is a good

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:21.500
idea and i've even started like a change.org petition that's gotten over 130 000 signatures

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:30.140
and basically saying that the ink should extend this um these enhancements that they had in place

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:36.780
right now especially also you know there's you know disabled players as well that these

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:40.620
additional enhancements that they had allowed them to actually be able to enjoy the game more

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:49.100
um so yeah and then of course with that of course they uh fans were actually saying that

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.940
they're going to start boycotting the game um because of some of these issues and they're

01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:03.180
boycott a free game well i mean yeah you you can do that i mean but like if they make money off

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.900
of people playing the game and buying the in-game purchases so if you boycott the game it does hurt

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:15.180
them in the wallet so that's all you can really do um but basically yeah so now you can announce

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:21.180
some more legendaries from sword and shield that are going to be coming to port uh pokemon go and

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.820
uh with those they're going to be part of this ultra unlock thing they have to do these challenges

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:34.140
to unlock it between august 20th and september 1st but apparently um they were saying that you know

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.700
because of you know some of these issues and stuff folks are just going to be kind of boycotting

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:46.300
the game um unless they you know come back to you know extending these features that they had so they

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:53.020
were trying to trend uh boycott niantic to show their displeasure with the game and i don't know

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:56.540
i haven't played pokemon go in a long time pack your bags because you're not going to like the

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.940
resolution they come up with so the question is going to be how important or shinies to you

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:09.900
i i'm i'm trying to be mean or rude but i do think there is a large percentage of people that

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.140
are signing these petitions and things like that and the number one reason why they're mad and they

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:19.580
want things reverted back is that they can no longer hump the pokey stop that was just outside

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:24.140
a range of their house anymore for gear all day long or that is absolutely not fair to the

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:31.740
disabled community that is but i did not say everybody i said most now the disabled but as

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.980
far as the disabled community go i i agree that there are issues there and things that that need

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.700
to be looked at but these are things that have kind of existed for the first four years of the

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:46.940
game as well i think they did a horrible job in communicating i said this last week as well is

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.580
that for them to say oh these changes are because of covid and then they say at the time but we're

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.900
going to keep them for the foreseeable future which implies there's no end date and then to

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:01.100
revoke them when they did and by saying oh well you know now that covid is even though they kind

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.780
of didn't phrase it that way but they kind of insinuated because covid is winding down we're

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:10.220
gonna you know go put back all these changes that we made and i said this last week and i do agree

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:16.780
for with this part niantic did stupid with that like they shouldn't have done that but my honest

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:22.860
and i've said this a lot they're gonna put that 80 kilometer or that 80 kilometer that 80 feet

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:27.020
thing back you're not gonna like what they're gonna do because i'm i'm telling you right here

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:31.580
i know how this ends they're gonna put that in there but they're gonna put a cool down on pokey

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.900
stops like more than five minutes they're gonna do something similar to ingress where maybe you

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:42.220
can spin it four times and then that's it no more gear for like six hours or 12 hours um because

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:47.980
that's the thing that niantic is trying to stop are the people is that that i really truly believe

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.580
to be the majority of people signing this petition who are just upset that they can't

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:56.540
spend their desk portal and and so forth as far as and again i want to stress as far as the

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.180
disability issues yes i understand those concerns that's legitimate that's a different issue that

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.740
niantic has to look into that's an issue that's needed to be looked into for the last four years

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:15.100
it's nothing new now um let's see uh bonds 006 in chat says i am split on the radius debate of

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:22.460
the pokey stops um and that's it's other folks still uh pod culture says who me abuse a pokey

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:28.220
stop never look and i'm not saying like those players are doing anything wrong or bad or what

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:33.020
have you i'm just it is playing the game yeah they're just i get like and i'm not trying to be

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:39.500
mean again i promise i'm just giving you the reality check right um go ahead i was going to

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.420
say i've kind of looked at it the same way as the people who complain about no ed and dead by

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:51.500
daylight it's in the game it's a function if people use it it's okay it's a function of the

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:57.020
game so i don't get mad about it and niantic did botch the messaging on this they absolutely botch

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:01.500
the messaging on this and their reply to this community thing which i thought was very impressive

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:06.140
that all the community sites got together and demanded they give a response i thought niantic's

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:13.180
response to it was very like yikes but again i just don't think you're gonna like where they end

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:18.540
up on at the end of this um but i was gonna say i don't fault the people that were you know like

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:22.780
pod culture saying i was spinning a stop and all this stuff sure i benefited from it too are you

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.140
kidding when i would walk around and you know use my bluetooth of course i could hit stops that were

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:34.060
even further away but um nobody likes to be given something and then have it taken away

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:41.740
nobody likes that that's what this really boils down to um and as far as the whole the other

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.380
weird thing to me is this whole well number one the fact that they're introducing zassian and

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:52.620
zamzata and all this stuff and the the freaking gen 8 pokemon before they've even finished gen 6

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:58.220
have done nothing with gen 7 i mean it's just weird like i i can understand that they could

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:03.260
you know you sometimes have regions in pokemon that are a mix of other regions is it like this

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.700
new um uh uh pokemon legends our arceus game that's coming out is kind of like that where

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:13.260
it's like a mix or snap or things like that like but it's like it hasn't been in the pokemon go

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:19.100
lore until now so it feels a little weird but i don't i do not think this is some resp like them

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:23.820
putting gen 8 in the game suddenly the the some of the gaming media is trying to frame it like oh

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.380
this is a response to the protest and everything going on is niantic's now trying to sweeten the

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:35.020
pot y'all it takes a lot longer to prep the artwork the data and all this like this has

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:42.380
been in in the works well before they were making any of these changes so that no i don't no no no

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:47.420
i don't buy that and that that part kind of makes me roll my eyes when i see those headlines because

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:52.380
i'm like y'all don't understand clearly nobody out there is playing this game that's writing

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:01.100
about it so anyway um so yeah i mean that's that's my take on it take her to leave it um am i gonna

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.820
stop playing the game probably not but i mean i just use it as something to kind of like

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:11.260
incentivize my walking i don't necessarily need to spend a ton of money on the game i don't think

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:15.580
niantic is really convincing me to spend money on the game outside of you know some of their events

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:22.140
are pretty cool um but that's you know that's it um the remote passes i guess are kind of neat too

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:27.420
but i'm able to get enough coins for that by doing the gym thing um sg100 matt says they emphasize

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:32.380
that the game is about exploring and walking they use this as justification of the 40 meter spin

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.580
radius thing which i get but doesn't the fact that remote rate passes kind of go against that

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:42.460
exploration of walking they're calling for no because it makes money and i i think that's a

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:49.340
fair call out is that again why their response was not great and having played niantic games

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:55.740
for a very long time and understanding that john hanky comes from a google maps background and that

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.180
is very much about like being out there and exploring especially with street view and things

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:04.140
like that like i get and especially when you look at that they're very if you look at niantic's very

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:12.060
first app what was niantic's very first app it was not ingress gotcha a lot of people say oh

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:16.540
yeah angry nope it was no it wasn't ingress but i don't remember what it was field tripper

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:21.100
was their first down and that was i don't think they supported anymore but that was that was

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:27.660
where the very very very original uh ingress uh portals came from was this game about kind of

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:33.740
you know starting that idea of these landmarks in your city to go exploring and all of that stuff

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:40.140
that's where that came from so like i get that that is niantic's mission and honestly for me

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:45.260
it's been very successful i've seen a lot of places i would never have gone to if it wasn't

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:49.980
for things like ingress i'm gonna specifically call out ingress pokemon go just kind of piggybacks

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:57.660
on my ingress experience to be quite honest um no that's absolutely accurate yeah so that part of it

01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:03.580
i get um but i also at the same time can recognize what has to show in her mat is saying you can see

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.260
that obvious conflict there and i think that's what a lot of the community is starting to call

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:12.940
out is that but if you pay for it you can have this experience and i think you know again there's

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:19.900
talk about like poke you stop power ups and stuff like that that maybe could uh yeah um

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:25.980
pod culture and chat says field tripper a bunch of bored kids on a bus with tired adults

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.700
no no no not that kind of thing uh as joe and her mat says wasn't that where the memes of being

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:35.900
let off a cliff came from well i think also i've seen those memes about um the the pissed off

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.940
pokemon go player base and it's that meme of the the guys just happening with map quest back in

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.020
the day well it's the meme of those guys on the pirate ship and they're about to die or something

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:50.460
like that and the one says like uh i'm an angry pokemon go player and then it says ingress player

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:57.180
first time that whole thing uh because ingress has had its own share of issues over the years for

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:03.420
sure but i've never seen the player base quite well we had that transition to prime that a lot

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:08.060
of people straight up didn't like and a lot of people left the game as a result of it and i'm of

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:14.540
a minority opinion of sorts i think sometimes prime has made ingress better it took i don't

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:19.180
know i stopped playing ingress a while ago it didn't help it took a long time to get there

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:25.260
but it now it's made ingress better that first year i don't i can see why people were pissed

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:30.140
off absolutely but now ingress prime has made the game better but it just took like what three years

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:38.540
to get there so all right anyway let's move on uh oh let's talk about a different nintendo story

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.620
i mean technically pokemon go isn't really nintendo it's more of like a license type of thing

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:49.260
but let's talk about nintendo sales and nintendo financials so nintendo has published money their

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:56.460
most recent quarterly report and uh they have uh made a little less money this year uh in the three

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:01.420
months leading up to june 30th they had a operating profit of 119 billion yen that's

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.860
about 1.1 billion dollars that's a lot of fucking money um however it's not as much fucking money

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:15.100
as last year when they made 1.3 billion that's a 17.3 percent drop but i think we all was still

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:20.300
animal crossing the other year though exactly exactly i was like we can all see what the what

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:25.660
what what was happening last year that isn't happening as much nearly this year lockdowns

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:30.460
and animal crossing it was the perfect storm combination last year that worked out very well

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:35.980
for nintendo we don't like to look at companies profiting off the pandemic um but nintendo didn't

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.140
that was not nintendo's plan we're profiting off people having to be home it's less of the

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.700
pandemic you know and they didn't even know that there was going to be a shutdown the same month

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.300
they released animal crossing yes and as i was trying to get to that was not nintendo's plan

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.860
like nintendo didn't play it was just the perfect storm that happened that allowed allowed things

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:57.660
to get there um but yes they have not had an animal crossings this year quite frankly

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.860
i don't think they've really had a big game yet this year now i mean some may argue that oh

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:11.180
sure mario tennis and all that stuff yeah no um but when you look at later this year we've got

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.060
wario ware get it together zelda skyward sword will show up in the next um uh right because that

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:21.900
was a july release uh metroid dread is coming mario party superstars pokemon brilliant diamond

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.820
shining pearl so i mean there's a lot of good stuff to look forward to from nintendo and i

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:31.420
think the financials will be different um but at the same time if you're upset about 1.1 billion

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:40.460
dollars um stop that i'm upset about the 1.1 million dollars that no one's giving me right

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:48.860
i would take 1.1 dollars right now every little bit i could use a few more dollars than that

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:56.300
um yyr in chat says i thought the drop would be way more not because they're doing poorly now but

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.500
because they did so well last year yeah like i mean honestly the fact that they only fell 17

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.420
actually seems pretty good uh sia tabiri in chat says and animal crossing updates yes the game

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.460
could still use some of those as well i'm surprised they didn't do dlc i think they're

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:15.340
done with that though they did and they did one recently i covered it last week yeah that was that

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:20.780
was a tiny tiny little bump though we we need something major major uh like that mario thing

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:25.020
was pretty cool or something like that would be you know nice or the fucking cafe like you said

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:30.460
some more buildings from the other um iterations it was data mine that we were supposed to have

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:37.980
brewster yeah man if they announced that i would be immediately back into playing um the gyroids

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:43.980
i'm surprised was never a thing this is yeah they're kind of morbid though if you actually

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:51.340
know where they came from yeah but we don't have to talk about it um stirlock in chat says

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.100
i really need to get back into animal crossing i think there's a lot of people saying that

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.980
but animal crossing at the same time should give us something to come back to

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:09.260
right yeah yeah all right let's move on dark sakura well um here's the nintendo franchise

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:16.860
that i think uh we can agree is fairly epic and that's going into metroid so they released a

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:25.500
trailer um for metroid dread that brings up the chozo um it's it's a pretty short little

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:33.580
little trailer it's like you know 34 seconds but it brings up the chozo it you know shows their

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:41.500
their sort of hieroglyphics looking uh wall art i don't know what to call it like

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:51.580
it's very very egyptian like in nature um and so uh of course in the previous metroid games we

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:58.140
always had like a statue or a ghost or something written by one or the chozo

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:03.020
uh robot you know that did something on you go to the abandoned ship in super metroid

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:12.460
um what people aren't realizing is that there is a whole lot more lore already existing about

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:20.620
the chozo and if you look into samus uh into her uh history she was raised by the chozo

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:25.180
and actually had some of their dna bonded to her so that she could live on their planet

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:34.540
and so i'm actually hoping that we get a lot more throwback to uh her time with chozo you know

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:40.380
a lot more of her history with growing up among the chozo and where they all went and what happened

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:46.860
to them because you know they also made the metroids and where did that get them i'm really

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:52.140
looking forward to it i've always had fascination with the chozo in that series and you know me when

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:59.980
i get into a game i really get into the lore so i'm really excited about it and of course um

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:05.420
it'll be out october 8th for switch and we'll find out our answers there i reckon

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.980
yeah i mean samus is a pretty unique character you might say she's the chozo one

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.460
are you looking at how i'm staring at you right now no i'm not you should be i will be

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:25.100
episode from the archive so that pun dies tonight this is me staring at you in judgment

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:33.420
just carrying on the tradition of the 23rd maggots that's all all right you are a dad i guess

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:38.220
somebody has to bring the dad jokes to this show all right check out they call them dad jokes

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:45.580
because they don't want to call them bad jokes hi i did one too now that actually was pretty funny

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:56.380
all right moving on come on dad what's the next story yeah dad well uh let's talk about

01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:05.020
duke nukem again um so apparently uh the embracer group has bought seven different studios including

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:12.460
3d realms so they had purchased um basically some of the publishers uh like uh gearbox

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:20.860
thq nordic and deep silver uh but now they've bought three realms ghost ship games um what else

01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:32.300
uh forcefield easy trigger uh dixie uh dixie art and crazy labs so a lot of those i don't recognize

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:40.220
but i mean i definitely recognize 3d realms so don't know what that means necessarily in

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:47.340
the terms of new games i guess we'll have to wait and see i would like to see a keep well making if

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.620
they keep making duke nukem games at the um regular rate we'll find out in about 2030

01:26:54.780 --> 01:27:02.140
yes well there was like um there was a a new 3d like fps game that was done in the

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:09.980
build engine so you know definitely the same technology as uh duke nukem 3d but you know

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.540
pretty awesome polished game they had a lot of stuff with that that retro throwback game yeah

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:19.820
yeah yeah yeah so they have some of those i like to see more of those coming along i mean duke nukem

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:28.380
he's a hard character to kind of bring into this modern age of 2021 i mean just not necessarily

01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:36.540
a character i could see a lot of folks liking nowadays um but i don't know more games like that

01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.700
that would be fine i guess like actually now that i think of it you know there's some games

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:47.180
that came from the build era that are still kind of doing well so maybe who knows what was that

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:52.860
game forever was not good what was that retro that game now it's gonna bug me it it uh it had a like

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:58.540
a disagreement with a metal band it was very similar to um some metal band there was that one

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:02.140
but there's been there's been actually a few other ones oh i don't remember that was the one i was

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:07.660
thinking of yeah i know which one you're i don't remember the name but yeah i it's there was a

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.060
couple other ones that were also using the build engine that looked pretty awesome there's one i

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:16.700
just saw recently it's using the doom engine like the original doom engine but it's like it doesn't

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:22.460
look like it's running doom anymore i mean they've done so many tweaks to it but there's a lot of

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:27.340
these games i like that where they kind of take this old technology and really enhance it to with

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:33.340
the modern visuals but it's still you know the old school engines which is kind of cool

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:40.860
or just a mod just a really good mod which you know is a really good mod the the um you know

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:45.420
xbox and playstation and all those versions of the game like officially support mods now

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:51.260
thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you iron maiden but they changed the name to ion fury

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.980
yeah i knew it was some metal iron maiden yeah exactly iron maiden had an issue with it and

01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:02.060
yeah so now it's ion fury yes thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you all right you get more

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:09.660
than just the glitter for doing that research for me all right let's move on let's talk about a game

01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:14.540
that for some people gets a gold star for some people not so much it's pokemon unite which

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:19.660
i actually i played a little bit more of that this week but um i don't know i like playing the game

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.300
by myself isn't as fun like if i can hop on there with friends and stuff it's a little more fun

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.060
because we have something to talk about but playing with randos gets kind of old to me but

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:32.460
i i still as far as mopas go it still is probably one of my favorite ones i'll check it out when

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.500
it's on mobile phones as well i want to see how it plays on the phone um comparatively but pokemon

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:43.740
unite just got a big update so um there is a new update that really went in there and uh changed

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.260
some balance and maybe that's why i'm pissed because eldegoss kind of got hit with the nerf

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:53.500
bat and she can't heal as much as she did before um although i guess her uh special attack move

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:58.700
uh can do more so i don't know i guess there's a trade-off there but um like pretty much all the

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.860
other pokemon got some type of changes i i'd list them all off but it was just about everybody

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:07.580
uh so that here earlier this week and i believe it's also bringing a spectate mode to the game

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.500
although they did not enable that at first um i can't remember if that's in there now or if that's

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.980
still coming um but uh next month there is plans for the mobile release and there will be cross

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:23.020
platform play between of course the switch and smartphones um and if you log into your nintendo

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:28.220
account or your ptc that's pokemon trainer club account you can cross save data in progress which

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.620
would probably be a good idea i'm just curious how moving around is going to work on the mobile

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:36.940
phones but i guess if you just tapped on the screen where you want to go it might work out

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.500
um so interesting mike defton chat says i'm playing it right now well i hope you're i hope

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.260
you're doing well i hope you're winning who's your main mike deft that's what i want to know

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:49.420
because i was i will say the one thing i did do this week i i'm like an eldegoss main right i

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:54.940
played like 98 of my matches with eldegoss i bought snorlax and try to match with snorlax

01:30:54.940 --> 01:31:00.060
because i i like snorlax as a pokemon and uh i thought the moves would be fun oh boy did i get

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:06.540
beat oh boy did i get beat i guess i need more practice okay nine tails i was looking at i was

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.860
looking at that's because it's a lowland nine tails slash volpix right i was looking at that

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:16.300
one because i like the whole like freeze mechanics and stuff um maybe i'll check that one out next

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.820
all right anyhow it's uh time for our next segment here at orange launch

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:26.140
radio which uh i would say needs no introduction but we actually have a special introduction

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:43.740
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:48.700
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:57.100
but as we know in a 2021 twist once a month we get a flag that means fucking weird arcade game

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:02.940
and i believe that's what dark soccer has picked for us tonight right oh believe me we get the flag

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:08.940
so basically the game that i chose and on its own it doesn't necessarily seem like it should

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:14.220
be a flag until you actually see it played the game is final furlong which i have brought up

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:21.580
many many a time as the horsey humpin game it is a horse racing game developed by namco it came out

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:31.100
in arcades in 1997 um it is one of the only two games that run the namco system 22.5 gorgon

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:39.660
hardware which is a early revision of the namco system 23 hardware so basically in this game you

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:44.780
have three checks to choose from six and a half furlongs a one mile and a one and a half a mile

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:50.860
you have different horse classifications you have like a leader a front runner a mid runner

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.660
a strong finisher and two quote almighty runners who like to keep their position

01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:02.060
you sit on a saddle as it were and you have this

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:10.780
i this thing it doesn't really look like a horse it's got like well it kind of kind of does but um

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:17.660
i've seen the ones where they don't exactly like look exactly it's just so weird they're just weird

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:24.460
okay they kind of look like horses but you have this bar you hold on to and the thing is is that

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:29.820
if you fit on it then you're supposed to ride it like it's a horse and you know move with it

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:35.020
and everything but i've seen people who are way too tall for this thing who just stand up and

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:43.820
push at it and people look like they're humping the horse just just what it's just it's fucked up

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:48.860
um we had one i don't know if they still have it because i haven't been there in ages but

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:54.780
roseville golf land had one no they had one i remember they had one at uh country club lanes

01:33:54.780 --> 01:34:00.380
for a while um but that's gone unfortunately roseville golf land had one that's tucked over

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:04.780
like along the same wall as the entrance that's where i remembered it being and then they replaced

01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:12.220
it with derby's owner club long gone yeah it's been a while it's been a while years um and uh

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:20.140
uh basically though it did get a rating as one of the best games overall with the quote from

01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:25.020
gerald lynch for tech radar saying the machine was brutal popping you a straight a giant plastic

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:30.300
horse you'd propel yourself forward by getting up your steed rocking maniacally forward and

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.660
backwards to speed the beast up best played with two players the marathon like events would last

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:41.740
so long you wouldn't be able to walk for a week um yeah that's what they say about humping sometimes

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:50.540
too just saying um at any rate there actually was a sequel to final for long um and that was

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:59.900
final for long too aptly named one we had actually yeah i'm pretty sure that that was it um and it

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:10.620
had like some more options it came out in 1999 um and it also was uh i want to say it also ran on

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:17.980
no it ran on system 23 it ran on system 23 so it did use the upgraded system um both of these

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:24.540
though i do believe could link up to four players playing so it was kind of neat it was just i mean

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:31.020
the thing that that again classifies this as swag for me is just how how it looks when you play it

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:39.660
yeah they look like less of them riding it more of them choking the horse violently yeah yeah

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.380
they're they're they're doing the hump with the horse but

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:48.060
they're they're getting their fictitious catherine the great on

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:58.140
but yeah that's that's the game final furlong all right there it is let me give my earbuds back in

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:04.060
there classic flag of the month final furlong and um i'm sorry i ran to the restroom so you

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:08.300
guys probably brought this up but we had that one locally at a country club right yes i also

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.700
brought out the one that they had at rvgl as well i don't remember i don't remember that one

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:20.860
and i had one for a hot minute fun all right yeah and honestly uh derby owners club was a much

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:26.140
better horsey game i'll be honest it was but but but not quite as much fun to watch as this one

01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:33.340
i've injured myself on final furlong i wonder where all those derby owners club games have gone

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:39.100
i think the one from what i understand the one at rvgl is still there but i also haven't been

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:45.100
there in like two years no it's not i i'm pretty i want one the last time i was there which was

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:52.220
back in 2020 i'm pretty sure it was not there anymore i i usually walk around because if it

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.940
was there i would totally be playing it so i'm gonna kick dan's mustang out of the garage and

01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:05.500
get a derby derby owners club kidding that's worthy really nice um i swear the last time i

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:10.140
was at a dave and busters i think the one of the great mall they still had this set up for it but

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.180
granted that was a few years ago at this point so i haven't checked on it lately that's a dnb

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:22.540
that has gone kind of downhill ever since they got rid of the uh battle tech thing oh yeah i

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:27.100
forgot that was battle tech in the day too now it made me nauseous as all hell but the battle tech

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:31.500
pods were really fun well yeah those are the ones that bobby's talked a lot about those on his show

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:37.340
because they still they still bring them to dragon con every year i used to play that back in was

01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:44.940
that they had it was i never was called now in the downtown plaza in sacramento it was like a

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:54.060
bunch of uh bars fuck that's america live america live that is a throwback locally here that place

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.820
that is that is now an arena well yeah yeah

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:04.780
pod culture brings up the star wars pod it's kind of not the same thing though because you're not as

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:13.900
immersed yeah this is like um it's very you know the battle tech had a very complicated system

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:19.980
yeah but it was cool uh yyr says uh pretty sure all the dave and busters got rid of derby owners

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:25.100
club by now well that's unfortunate but at the same time it probably wasn't bringing in the money

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:29.580
and they probably wanted to put in you know i don't know whatever stupid machines make money

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:35.420
i just remember the names we would name our our horses oh yeah all the silly names who come up

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:41.500
because i still have a bunch of my cards um i haven't um been to a dave and busters a long

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.820
time ever since round one was a thing i don't think i've been to a dave and busters since

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:53.660
round one kind of started being a thing i went to dave and busters about a it had to have been like

01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:01.180
in january or so because i met up uh last year because i met up with jd and we went to the one

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:08.780
that's like way out closer to daily city oh yeah yeah way out there okay the ceremony yeah yeah

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:13.420
yeah because that's where it was already at and so that's where alan lived when we first

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:20.300
started dating was that area this was quite a quite a commute yeah yeah um uh i was gonna say

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:25.020
that round one here locally in roseville still not open as far as i know unless it just happened in

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:30.140
the past couple weeks but i don't think so and uh that's it's weird because round ones have been

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:33.820
open i've been to the one in concord since the pandemic i was there just recently a few weeks

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.140
ago before the the delta variant kicked up and all that stuff but still it's still like i'd

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:42.220
they're not shutting businesses down again they're saying get vaccinated and wear a mask

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:49.420
and you know most businesses are staying open um so uh um i've been around one recently so

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:52.940
it's weird that the one in roseville still isn't open but i guess maybe they really just want to

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:59.180
wait out the the quote-unquote worst of the pandemic behind they're just behind on getting

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:05.100
it done because there's also the movie theater that's supposed to go above it or blow it yeah

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.860
another industry that got hurt through all this pretty yeah it was like a

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.660
cinema or something like that so it's

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:19.260
yeah i i i look every time i'm at the mall and it's it's never open i'm like oh i wonder if some

01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.940
of these movie theaters are waiting for that um was it a warner brothers deal or that whole like

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:27.660
hbo max thing they'd only promised that through 2021 so i wonder if some of these are waiting for

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:33.740
that to be done before they open theaters new theaters again you know because i guess the whole

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.860
like a simulcast deal has been hurting some of the box office intake ask ask garland johanson

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:48.460
what she thinks of that and that whole thing so yeah yeah all right anyhow uh let's go ahead and

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:52.940
travel around and check out some rapid fire news and quickly check out some other things going on

01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:58.700
in the industry we'll start with loki so curveball space program has officially announced that they're

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:04.380
ceasing um development on the first game which i guess makes sense because they're putting out

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:09.340
curveball space program too so it would have had to have stopped at some point but keep in mind

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:14.540
though they've been developing the game for 10 years so a long time you know i i think that

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:21.260
they're allowed to do that the last update uh was just released on august 3rd um and that was

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:30.540
the one point 112.2 update which fixed over 90 bugs in the game so yeah i guess it's fine that

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:36.140
they've stopped development on that since they got to move on at some point um and apparently

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:42.060
pac-man 99 has been doing well uh despite the fact that it's not you know the the mario game

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:48.380
and that has surpassed four million downloads on the nintendo switch um i attribute that to

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:53.500
the lack of things that they're putting out as part of that nintendo online since we're not

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:58.540
getting a lot of new games but you know hey people like their battle royale games and that's kind of

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:05.100
cool um is this going to be a temporary game as well because like i don't know they haven't really

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:09.100
said i don't know i don't think they undated it i don't think i just want still around right tetris

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.420
one's still around and uh it was just that mario one for whatever reason they put an expiration

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:21.900
date on it that's so stupid i don't get it it's just dumb um all right uh is dark soccer there

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:26.220
as she turned off her cam so she might yeah she might have gone afk for a second so um i'll do

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:31.740
a quick aside before we get to her story since she brought up pac-man um uh alan was just at costco

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.620
like just now today like before the show and he said you're laughing because you know where this

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:41.020
is going right were you know where this is going no i haven't been in costco but i already there's

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.780
only one possible outcome because i could just be so he sent me this picture on our chat app that we

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:55.660
use um oftentimes um that he saw at costco for i'm sorry i'm looking at the price here 369

01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:01.740
he found this i'm holding up my phone like you guys can see it he found this arcade one up machine

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:09.500
that is super pac-man now i gotta say i love the fact that it's branded super pac-man because a

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:14.540
lot of times these things are reskinned as oh hey alan funny you should walk in here this

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.540
i'm talking about what you saw at costco here do you want to do you want to are you camera

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:22.780
safe do you want to talk about no he showed he didn't want to come on and talk about it

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:28.300
but he sent me a picture of it and he was like you know kind of not word for word but was kind

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:33.820
of like you know you want it type of thing basically and i here here was my response my

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:39.340
response says the minute we put the money down to buy that cabinet that's when the

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:46.060
tron pre-orders are going to go up and we're going to be pissed so i i actually said no

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:51.660
you saw that they finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game right yes i did see they

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:57.340
finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game i don't know why they waited so long but like i

01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:02.140
don't either yeah um so the here's the thing and then we'll get back i see dark soccer's back so

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:06.460
we'll get to her rapid fire stories as soon as i wrap up the story um the on the arcade one-up

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:11.820
machine uh with the super pac-man i did again i love that it's super pac-man branding which maybe

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:20.700
jamie wants to hear this i don't know uh sure at costco a 369 super pac-man branded arcade one-up

01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:28.460
with super pac-man pac-man pac-mania galaga galaxian dig dug and pac-land so it's seven games

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:33.580
and those are like honestly i love me some super pac-man i like pac-mania i like pac-land i love

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:42.140
dig dug so that's a pretty solid cabinet the only problem is if i i there's another cabinet they put

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:48.300
out not recently that's not excuse me a little bit recently that's not at costco and it's the namco

01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:55.820
legacy machine and that machine has all of the same games but it's 4 49 it's it's almost like

01:44:55.820 --> 01:45:04.300
80 more than costco but it's pac-man pac-land pac-man plus super pac-man pac and pal pac-mania

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:14.220
galaxian galaga dig dug dig dug two mapi which is huge and rompers are in that machine so yeah i'm

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:19.020
like oh the dig dug two even though that wasn't quite as good as the original uh because it's

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:25.100
very different and um the uh mapi really make that cabinet but i love the fact that this one is is

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:29.900
branded super pac-man now to answer the question in chat where somebody said why not somebody

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:38.300
said why not both uh w04 said porque no los dos um the tron cabinet and the super pac-man eventually

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:43.900
um some things are in the works that i haven't talked about yet um but i will very soon i promise

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:50.380
and we'll be able to have a little more um space around where we live to have some more cabinets

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:57.580
because we're making some changes um but right now i could i could squeeze in one more

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:04.380
but you know again like i said the minute i buy the super pac-man cabinet that tron cabinet's

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:09.260
gonna come out and then i'll be pissed because i won't have any space for the tron cabinet

01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:14.780
so bobby blackwolf in chat says wait for tron that's the plan because here's my thought tron

01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:18.700
could end up being a limited thing like maybe the burger time thing was and i don't know if

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:23.820
i'll be able to get it forever pac-man you're gonna be able to get pac-man forever and it's

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:28.300
not even so much pac-man as it is super pac-man for me but those games are always going to go

01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:33.340
hand in hand if there's a pac-man cabinet it's gonna have pac-man ms pac-man pack of

01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:40.940
pac-land it's gonna have the various pac-man games in it for sure so i will wait all right

01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:46.540
anyhow i won't wait any more to get some more rapid fire news dark sakura now that song is in

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:51.900
my head i can't wait my new shoes oh i thought you were gonna the dawson's creek song no

01:46:52.860 --> 01:47:00.860
um first of all no second of all i hate that song and third of all no and number four i hate that

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:11.580
show so getting into some actually interesting stuff um there uh there's another mario game

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:17.580
that has come out and sold for a shitload of money there is an unopened copy of super mario

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:28.220
brothers again that um sold for 2 million um that topped the 1.56 million uh for a super mario 64

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:38.140
this particular one by the wata scale is a 9.8 a plus rating which means it is in exceptional

01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:49.260
condition and cool i just i just don't understand what you know i i get that this is a very specific

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:53.100
pressing of the game so even if you have like a super mario brothers cartridge lying around

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:58.540
chances are this is not the two unless you again are extremely lucky and have you know lottery luck

01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:02.620
it's not the one that's going for 2 million in fact these things going for 2 million have the

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:09.260
box instructions unopened but it's that very specific like sears tab top to the box it was

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:19.740
sold for a very limited time only at sears so silly all right and then um now space invader's

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:26.220
invincible collection is going to be on switch but it's gonna cost 60 bucks on august 17th

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:33.340
too much uh huh i said too much money yeah that's pretty much what i'm going with um

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:41.580
tito announced the collection um it is available for pre-order um but that that's quite a bit um

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:51.820
it has 11 different versions of space invaders from the original 1978 uh to uh 2018 space

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:59.100
invaders giga max 4se and has a free download of the 2017 mobile release arcanoid versus space

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:10.060
invaders um but i mean it is kind of niche you know yeah i'm with sterlock who says that's one

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:14.860
expensive tab the good news is these types of games tend to go on sale pretty quick so wait

01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.500
for like you know around the black friday time of year and i bet you this comes way down in prize

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:29.020
yeah but i mean i i won't be spending it for that i mean if i was gonna get getting a physical copy

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:37.020
maybe yeah but no i think this is interesting the stuff that yyr is talking about is still talking

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.460
about that mario sale but i think this is interesting why we are in regards to the mario

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:45.100
cartridge sale says this is basically just one company trying to drive up the prices i wouldn't

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.460
be shocked if they sold it to themselves nothing about these last few weeks record-breaking mario

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:55.580
game sales is legit it did seem to come out of nowhere didn't it when i've always been led to

01:49:55.580 --> 01:50:00.940
believe that stadium events is supposed to be like that must have nes game where did this freaking

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:06.780
like super mario brothers original box like 2 million cover i think stadium events was what

01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:12.140
like maybe 700 000 last time we talked it's just it's just we it is weird that this is all all of

01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:18.780
a sudden in it all right maybe i'm getting too much conspiracy theory but i think i think it

01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:23.660
just the timing is strange somebody else has suggested it's like pandemic driven

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:29.500
collectible mania or something but i don't it's just weird all right what's not weird some new

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:33.020

01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:56.620
the week i hate to keep going back to this but you y'all are falling down the rabbit hole in

01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:02.140
chat and i love it um sha100 matt again about the collectible thing says there is a backlog with

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:07.500
collectible appraisals services where you ship your collectible for it to be graded due to the

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.860
pandemic because of that prices have shot up on things and see i would never really thought of

01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:17.100
that but i didn't even realize that was the thing you could do but who would make who would mail in

01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:23.420
a two million two million dollar video game but i guess i guess it's possible but i can't i get

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:27.500
but i also understand like that is like something that's driving everything up even if not this

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:33.740
particular piece of merchandise went through that process so um fascinating i guess i need to watch

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:38.940
more antiques road show because i have no idea how all this works when it comes to collectibles

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:44.220
so who knows what i have a lot of shit in my house and who knows if any of it's worth anything

01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:51.900
maybe that's why i hang on to it all right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.900
get to the listener round table you may or may not have heard we are taking calls again so

01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:00.540
we'll check in on the green green room a little closer to the um listener round table in a little

01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:07.500
bit uh for now uh loki yeah so apparently we're hearing some more rumors about that

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:13.740
new playstation vr2 and this is coming from a leak from a sony developer conference and

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:20.700
apparently the leaker has been known to um have some reliable information so we'll go with that

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:26.460
and um you know some of the things we've kind of already heard about before you know with

01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:31.660
you know the different uh you know field of view so like you know it's supposed to have

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:36.860
110 degree field of view uh 10 it says up from 10 degrees from what it was before

01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:46.060
uh the resolution of 2000 by 2040 pixels per eye and apparently it's a little bit

01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:52.940
that is a little bit better than say the oculus quest 2 and then um you know of course there's

01:54:52.940 --> 01:55:00.060
going to be you know a oled display on there and um you know of course better lighting you know

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:04.540
color with that i want to hear more about the actual controllers but i don't think there's

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:12.140
anything in there about that um but yeah so lots more um a little bit more information

01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:17.180
kind of piggybacking on some of the earlier rumors that we heard before but there's this

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:25.900
whole video out now uh by this uh p psvr without parole um a youtuber that has uh some of the

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:31.100
details about that so i don't know sounds interesting i'm excited they when they finally

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.780
announce all the information and kind of how that's gonna work with especially backwards

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:40.300
compatibility and stuff like that and whether there's a new you know uh until dawn rush from

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:47.500
blood or rush of blood game because that's really gonna sell it for me um but yeah next year i guess

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:52.380
we'll just have to wait until all those leaks come out hopefully you can walk into target and

01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.100
get a fucking playstation 5 oh yeah yeah gonna have to have a playstation 5 to run that on too

01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:02.540
i guess that's kind of important so um they can't figure out those chip shortages this vr is going

01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:10.460
to meet the same fate so this is true yes but um yeah and i'm sure i'll use it so much more than my

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:18.700
current vr headset which has been in the box for a year or two i don't so i don't know well it just

01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:24.220
depends it just depends if the games are there that's the most important thing so yeah all right

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:28.700
well one game i don't think we'll end up on psvr too because i think this is more of a microsoft

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:35.580
thing is pubg but did you guys hear the name of pubg has officially changed this week the new

01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:40.860
acronym is pubgbg because the new game the new name of the game is pubg battlegrounds

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:47.100
now atm machine yes it is like atm machine okay because think about let's let's think about what

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:53.340
pubg meant player unknown battlegrounds so the name of the game is player unknown battlegrounds

01:56:53.340 --> 01:57:01.420
battlegrounds that is yeah it's a game where that's like saying fight against each other

01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:07.420
and and it's that's like saying atm machine yes exactly i just said that

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:17.100
i missed it so yes uh pubg battlegrounds here's why they're doing it so they want to expand the

01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:24.300
pubg brand through new experiences set in the universe so calling pubg battlegrounds that is

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.380
going to be representative of the battleground game but there is a new game coming out called

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:36.380
pubg new state it's a mobile title with a futuristic setting uh it is uh um i guess the

01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:40.460
creators of dead space made a game called the callisto protocol which is connected to this

01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:44.620
oh yeah i remember seeing the trailer for that at one of the just call it the player unknown

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:47.100
universe or something like that like i mean pubg

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:57.020
i don't know the only way that they can really do this now is really lean into that like we need to

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:03.340
get you know you need to get someone saying yo dog i hear you like battlegrounds so we put

01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.260
battlegrounds in your battlegrounds so you can battlegrounds why your battlegrounds you know

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:12.060
they need to really lean into that now uh bobby blackwolf also points out part of it is that

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:15.820
player unknown has left the industry so they don't really want to use his name anymore so

01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:22.620
pubg has just kind of become a i guess you know perhaps you should have renamed your game a long

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:26.860
time ago well wait i have okay i have a great idea here because i was going to say here's

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:30.460
some even more exciting now if you want actually something to actually be excited about when it

01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:36.620
comes to pubg bg here it is there's an official collaboration coming between pubg battlegrounds

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:43.660
and blackpink the korean pop band cool so yes uh you could it's a black there's a blackpink

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:47.500
collaboration bundle there's like a new parachute and there's some other stuff as well so in my

01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:52.700
opinion why don't we just make this game blackpink battlegrounds because now there there's an

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:59.340
unproblematic fave that we can all be excited about uh owning the franchise so that's my bp

01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:10.220
bp bg bp bg bg the future of gaming although is it you know what when it comes to the whole like

01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:15.260
we want to create a universe and other experiences you know think back to the start of the show

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:20.540
and you know we all remember a day when it was pubg versus fortnight uh and you know look at

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:24.620
what we just we spent i can't believe we talked for 15 minutes at the top of the show if not more

01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:28.620
about fortnight but we sure did because it deserved it it did something that kind of

01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:33.180
necessitated the discussion um and you know what if pubg is going to be mixing it up with

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:37.660
different types of events and stuff i mean i don't think blackpink is doing a concert

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:42.380
i think this is just some some branded you know costumes and stuff for the store but

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:52.620
i for i for one welcome our bpg bg bg game um yyr in chat says blackpink versus ariana grande

01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:57.180
we can only hope that is the only way we can solve the fortnite pink worked with cardi b

01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:03.260
that's and a few other american artists yes and you know what let's let's not pit the

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:08.060
women against each other let's let's let's just let's let's be fans of all the games

02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:12.460
how about that all right how about women uplifting women right that's right that's right

02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:19.340
all right uh w u w bg bg all right let's move on dark sakura

02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:32.460
so um oh i lost my place for a moment anyway uh our type final three has been announced

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:40.220
and it's a free update to our type final two like are they just like do they call them final the way

02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:45.580
that graphic designers call their projects final or share it's never final or final

02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:50.380
we all know that shara's had so much surgery she's practically immortal

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:59.660
um either that or she's just gonna have uh um chad michaels fill in for her for the rest of

02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:09.180
her shows why not but anyway um granzella the developer is uh putting out the the update um

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:16.620
there's on the kickstarters page for uh uh our type final two um they're saying that there's

02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:23.100
going to get be more dlc more ships um and over the rest of the summer there's going to be some

02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:28.700
improvements to the pc version and finally by the end of the year our type final three

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:37.020
it'll be a free upgrade for those who already own our type final two and uh that it's only japanese

02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:45.420
only but there will be english subtitles later on so uh yeah at least they can count to three

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:51.420
valve uh orange right in chat says i played through our type final two good game

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.740
well now you'll have final three to play through as well exciting i love our type

02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:02.700
but nothing is ever the first level music for the first our type um the hits keep coming in chat in

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:10.860
regards to the pub gb g story uh yyr in chat says you're listening to olr radio okay let's have a

02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:17.580
chat do not refer to this show ever as olr radio um i don't want to speak for dark sakura but i

02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:21.260
have a pretty good feeling that if you do call this show olr radio if you look in the mirror

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:26.300
and say olr radio three times dark sakura will reach out to the email and slap you silly so

02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.100
don't do that am i right it will happen

02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:39.900
um and then bobby blackwolf says rob roberts hey watch it so i hate to bring things down

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:46.940
but but i just found out that an actress i really like died oh the marquee post story yeah i love

02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:53.660
night court okay no night court was great that is sad i had no idea she was um in in bad health but

02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:58.540
i guess she had been battling cancer for a little bit because um yeah she was still acting for quite

02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:04.620
some time she was uh the mom and something about mary yeah yeah so and she didn't she'd done other

02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:09.340
stuff here and there so yeah i actually saw john larroquette's post about it i don't mean to bring

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:14.140
things down but oh my goodness no it's fine well it's also sad that like like we've lost several

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:18.780
people from night court just in the past few years it feels like harry anderson died in 2018

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:25.260
and charlie robinson died uh this year as well yeah yeah i i was like i thought we just lost

02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:30.540
somebody else from that show not that long ago so anyway that's all right sometimes sometimes i

02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:34.460
have a night court marathon sometimes the news breaks during the show i mean even though that

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:37.820
technically was overnight but that's right sometimes we don't find out about them until

02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:43.660
we just hit that right tweet yeah all right um loki i feel like we alluded to this already in

02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:50.220
the show but uh why don't you make it official yeah so apparently grand theft auto 5 is leaving

02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:59.340
xbox game pass um you know it's not been on there for very long uh but yes there's gonna be some

02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:07.020
other um games coming as well though um so like this at least the early part of this month we've

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:13.340
got a you know katamari democracy reroll as you mentioned uh skate and skate 3 were put on there

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:21.900
as well uh this week art of rally and of course hades and then the stuff leaving um aside from

02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:31.820
grand theft auto we have uh dark siders genesis final fantasy 7 and uh don't starve and train

02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:38.540
sim world 2020 so yeah a lot of games leaving but there's been they've gotten a lot of like

02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:42.860
i just said like luminous and uh katamari were added recently so let's be honest if

02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:47.580
you haven't played grand theft auto 5 in the 10 years it's been out i mean like true

02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:54.540
true okay it's not even i played a little bit of five finally it hasn't been out for 10 years

02:04:54.540 --> 02:05:01.020
but it's been out close almost it's a long time it's almost eligible for classic game of the week

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:05.420
it is almost eligible for classic game of the week and we don't even have grand theft auto 6

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:13.660
yet so what is going on all right sorry games well um a game that absolutely should be and by

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:18.060
the way if you want to call into olr we're almost to that point of the show so um headed to the

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:22.300
green room if you want to call into olr i see somebody in the public chat but i'm not sure if

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:25.500
that is just left over because that was the same person that called in a bobby show so i'm not sure

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.100
if that's where they just kind of ended up after the show but head over to the green room if you

02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:36.620
want to be in be in tonight's olr um while i get while we wait for that uh heading to this story

02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:39.740
which now this is a classic game i'm almost positive this had to have been the classic

02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:45.660
game of the week at some point if not dark cycle we need to remedy that at some point but um this

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:49.420
game is absolutely something that's worthy of a classic and one that i wish would come back and

02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:55.500
i'm talking about marvel versus capcom 2 uh is a game that a lot of fans this week have just like

02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:02.540
it seems like it's a very viral thing on twitter oh it has been now uh episode 789 according to

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:08.540
our wiki whenever that was wow i'm not gonna say it's because of our show but i mean i did have it

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:12.300
as my background video a couple weeks ago so i just you know want to take full credit for that

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:17.900
and and everybody look at tonight's look gonna take you for a ride look at tonight's episode

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:26.780
number 879 and dark soccer just said this was the classic game on 789 is that a coincidence

02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:35.740
there are no coincidences anyway marvel versus capcom was 388 well for some reason the credit

02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:42.060
for this particular uh recent charge to get this game re-released is a content creator maximilian

02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:48.220
dude um i i don't know the name myself but they must be more popular than us um they began a

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:54.620
hashtag campaign called free mbc2 which apparently got a lot more steam than president kat did

02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:58.300
but um sorry one sec guys i just had an earpiece fall out

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:08.220
okay that was extremely graceful all right um so this style he's grace

02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:13.180
he'll drop his earbuds in your face again and i'm just sitting here lamenting how are there

02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:18.300
all these people more popular than us while i'm a big klutz we'll have on air all right

02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:24.060
uh there's a free mbc2 hashtag to try to get support among folks who want to see this crossover

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:30.780
head out now this these types of uh uh campaigns happen once in a while what makes this notable

02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:35.180
a similar thing to what made the president cat thing notable back in the day and that is the

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:39.740
developer responded remember that remember when the developer responded to us during the president

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:43.900
cat thing and i'm sure they were like what the fuck but that's not what they said i'm not a

02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:49.820
famous capcom responding so that's fine yes uh so in this case the studio head of digital eclipse

02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:56.780
mike mika actually said on twitter we made what i think was the last mbc2 release on console when

02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:04.620
we were known as backbone um let's see uh 16 by 9 and so forth i love the outpouring we'd swap

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:10.860
in ggpo and do documentary and museum work we'd need to talk to disney and capcom to make it real

02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:16.860
we're game if they are hashtag free mbc2 and oh yeah disney is a player now because disney owns

02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:24.060
marvel so that would be very interesting um so yeah um and of course folks note that digital

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:28.220
eclipse has worked a lot with this type of stuff they did the street fighter 30th anniversary

02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:32.780
collection they also did they also have worked with disney the disney afternoon collection

02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:41.180
and so forth um there was a playstation 3 and xbox 360 port of marvel vs capcom 2

02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:46.300
and that was pulled from online stores in 2013 because of the license that expired for the

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:52.380
comic book characters so um yeah it'll be interesting to see if this can actually happen

02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:58.940
though i would love that i could i can stand behind this that's for sure but some folks are

02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:02.860
saying you know again we don't you know if you could re-release it we don't have to shell out

02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:08.300
a hundred dollars for a copy you know that was on the dreamcast or whatever or pirate it which

02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:14.860
is what a lot of people are doing i think at this point so interesting uh dr tsuya says ggpo is the

02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:20.220
online thing i believe some of capcom's older re-releases use it like i think dnd did yeah

02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:24.780
they're probably talking about updating some of that online stuff so yeah i would i would love

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:29.180
that uh and quest buster filling me in because i'm very uncool and i don't know all the content

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:33.820
creators telling me that maximillian dude is a massive fighting game aficionado and he breaks

02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:38.140
down info to make it appealing to people that may have never played a fighting game before all right

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:44.940
well prop props to him he this this crossed our desk so um and you know obviously we don't catch

02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:53.180
everything so um congrats that's great uh dj rama s says i prefer capcom versus snk 2 over marvel

02:09:53.180 --> 02:10:00.140
versus capcom 2 to which i say why not both everyone's entitled to a wrong opinion why not

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:07.580
both let's have both in one release i think that would be great all right anyway i just i you know

02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:11.980
i don't even get you know talk about talking on fighting games to a level of people that don't

02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:17.260
usually get into fighting games i don't get into fighting games a lot but that is one that i love

02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:22.540
and i would instantly buy if it was re-released and you know not buggy or things like that so

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:28.460
that's that's for sure uh some folks in chat uh bobby blackwell says tatsunoko versus capcom

02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:35.420
well that'd be pretty cool um and dj rama s says rival schools hell yeah to that now we need

02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:42.380
shooting to justice die got going as in the college years all right we're gonna go to the

02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:48.140
listener round table and we're gonna take some calls here on orange lounge radio uh we just

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.980
recently brought this feature back and so it's still a little bit of an experiment in progress

02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:56.300
but if you want to give us a call head on over to the green room keep in mind i could pull you

02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:01.500
in here at any time so just be ready for that that's the one thing uh i've lost from before

02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:05.420
is the ability for people to hear when i've picked up the line and then acknowledge them they can't

02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.660
hear that anymore they're just boop they're on air so we'll see how that goes and we're gonna take

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:15.740
this call right now and see how it goes um hello you are on orange launch radio who's this

02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:20.140
hey there's that hey act f it is great to see you how are you

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:29.180
i'm doing pretty good um i just like some some of the things uh we're probably gonna talk about

02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:36.220
but yeah i'm thinking what's on your mind tonight um well basically i do want to talk about uh the

02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:40.540
niantic and pokemon go pull out all right have a great week we'll see you next time no i'm just

02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:45.660
kidding what what is your you you love pokemon go you play it a lot what's your take on this

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:55.740
whole thing uh yeah basically as you'll probably know i i do like a lot of what is pokemon and

02:11:55.740 --> 02:12:03.180
especially pokemon go i talk about it oh probably probably for every week uh if you see me on

02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:09.820
twitter i post a lot about it uh either getting chinese getting like perfect id

02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:14.460
pokemon playing go battle league me ugly begging you to join a remote raid

02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:24.220
sometimes yeah or open gifts stuff like that but yeah uh but basically i just want to

02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:32.780
add a little bit to at least a little bit little bit more of context to what's happening right now

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:39.580
yeah well yeah and obviously you all take all talked about uh the covid bonuses and all that

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:46.780
uh and especially the distance thing which it is it actually it is actually really useful

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:51.740
and like dark sakura mentioned uh too it's it helps a lot of disabled people

02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:58.220
uh i i personally know some of the uh in the community that actually benefited but because

02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:03.820
of that because they are disabled or they don't they don't have like easy access to some of the

02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:11.180
polka stops so it actually helps them and at the end of the day it helps us all but aside that

02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:18.220
aside that it's pretty much in you've already said it it's the handling of all the things it's like

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:26.380
yeah they responded they said they're they're they're listening or they're hearing us but at

02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:34.940
the same time the next day when the part uh part two of the ultra unlock starts and right now you

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:43.260
can get a heracross from from raids it's just a regional it's a regional that it's all available

02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:49.980
in some places of florida and most of latin america not where i live because i live to way

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:55.660
to up north of mexico but but still it's like okay it should be available in the wild it should

02:13:55.660 --> 02:14:02.620
be uh for those who live in those regions it should be accessible for them and what did

02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:09.340
diane take went and do they took out the wild spawn of heracross they took out they took it

02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:15.180
out pretty much of out of the game and the only way you can get anywhere what is a heracross

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:22.220
it's only through raids you only get one one raid per day one at least one free pass

02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:30.380
per day and you have to go to the gym uh so for anyone that oh yeah i live in central mexico i

02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:37.260
live in south america whatever oh i can uh a lot of people were excited they're excited because

02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:46.460
oh we're gonna we're gonna get a regional shine and niantic doing that and especially after what

02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:54.220
they did the day before is what is driven most people like really really out of the game and

02:14:54.220 --> 02:15:03.020
the point of all this is communication if niantic where to communicate better what their what their

02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:10.780
plans are if they actually like consider what the community wants and likes about the game

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:19.500
we wouldn't have these problems it's like and and and i was one to defend niantic in the past and

02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:27.500
and there's evidence of that too i'm not gonna i'm gonna like hide it but it got to the point

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:36.380
and especially this week that um that niantic is pretty much like at least they're showing us that

02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.820
they don't care they don't care about us they don't care about the player base the only they

02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:48.620
are they are only caring about getting the map you know in in my case yeah i'm gonna play the

02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:54.780
game because like i said the game is about the community the game is about us that we made the

02:15:54.860 --> 02:16:05.020
game basically but i'm not gonna spend any money on it like i don't no no no remote passes no

02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:12.700
premium passes no incense nothing that is gonna come from my pocket if i get if i get like poke

02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:19.180
coins that stuff it's gonna come from the gyms if i remember to do so you know but i was just

02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:22.380
saying sorry but i'm glad you brought up the hair cross thing because you're right i'd forgotten

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:25.580
about that and part of that is probably just because i'm spoiled because i don't live in that

02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:30.540
area where the hair across usually spawned so i forgot that this was the thing now if i remember

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:35.740
right niantic and again i and and let me finish my thought here because uh i i do think niantic

02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:40.860
made a boo-boo on this but if i remember right there was a tech issue where if they had kept

02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:45.500
niantic uh or if they kept hair across in the wild it would have that same shiny rate that

02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:50.620
was increased for the gyms so i think they increase it to like one in 64 in the gyms ends

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:54.460
up being a shiny and if they did that in the wild it would put too many of the shiny hair

02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:58.940
crosses or whatever in the wild and so i think they're going to put it back after the gyms are

02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:03.660
done but it would be at that normal shiny rate of like one in 512 or something like that now

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:09.900
that all being said and i've explained the the system limitation uh there's a very common line

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:14.700
we've started to use on this show a lot in fact it's not maybe the golden rule of gaming where

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:19.180
a system is only as good as the games that are on it but maybe it's the the silver rule of gaming

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:25.100
culture and that is it's not the facts it's what's perceived and the fact is if the tech

02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:30.060
system is broken niantic and the tech system is preventing you from having the thing in spawn in

02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:35.260
raids at the same time it's in the then fix the fucking tech that's the problem because what's

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:42.540
being perceived by folks like mike deft and many people around is is just that you're being shit

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:48.460
greedy is is what's happening and so the tech side of that badly needs to be fixed quite

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:54.140
honestly um can i tell you a weird anecdote though and it honestly has nothing to do with

02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:59.900
this but it was weird to me so you know that before all this covid shit started i was i was

02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:05.340
in that part of the world right i went to miami to take a cruise to some of the caribbean which is in

02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:11.180
that same you know uh a latitude area that like the parts of mexico where hair across spawns in

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:18.540
is and i caught lots of regionals i caught corsola i caught the um cactus thing that is

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:24.060
in that area in florida as well maractus yeah well maractus was the big one because that's

02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:29.420
that was the one that when i brought back like all the big pokemon players were in this area were

02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:33.900
like can i please trade you for a miraculous because that's the one you couldn't get anywhere

02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:39.020
else um and then uh and they're all gone now that's the one pokemon like all of them went

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:44.380
that i caught anyway carne vine that's the one i was trying to think of that part of the world

02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:49.340
so i got all this i didn't catch a single hair across that entire time just a weird a weird

02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:54.140
antidote that has nothing to do with this but it so when i was hearing about this i was like well

02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:58.220
hair across didn't fucking spawn anyway like because i was like i didn't catch them when i

02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:03.980
was down there but apparently that is very much just like apparently they spawn everywhere and

02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:08.460
it might just depend on the time like maybe i just was there at a weird time the only way i had a

02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:13.580
hair across was from our pal jd because he was playing pokemon go at the time and he went to

02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:17.500
florida on a family trip and he caught one and traded it to me so i had a hair across before

02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.700
this but now i'm like well i want a pink one but yeah of course i'm not i'm not affected by the

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:30.700
whole um it but but another pokemon that spawns in raid right now is kangaskhan right and i'm

02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:35.500
hearing that australia which is the new zealand which is the region or no does new zealand have

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:41.180
or they have just relicanth right they they i i think they have kangaskhan on new zealand too

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:48.380
and obviously australia it's like the oceania oceania but either way i'm hearing that they did

02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:55.500
not pull the kangaskhan wild spawns in australia so that is just again just a weird fucking

02:19:55.500 --> 02:20:01.820
perception too like okay but the kangaskhan are just gonna be everywhere in shiny but the hair

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:09.420
across can't so i i mean i get it i get why people are like dude you guys suck and and that's not

02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:15.740
not only that there's precedent of them unlocking regional shinies before and keep it done in the

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:25.180
wild so it's like it's it's not necessarily that they need to boost or they they want to keep it

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:33.180
like fair quote-unquote for everyone it's no it's it's like there's nothing that should

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:41.900
uh prevent them or like stop them to to release in the wild because again there's

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:49.740
already a precedent we already have like taro's as you said kangaskhan barfetch and mr mine which

02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:56.140
are regionals uh on someplace of the world and when those were really shiny though they were

02:20:56.140 --> 02:21:01.900
still spawning on the wild i i actually remember getting a wild taurus during that event in

02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:08.300
particular and getting the shiny because it wasn't the wild it was not only in eggs it was in the

02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:15.820
wild and it was i think full on it's what it was for once so even like something like hair across

02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:20.380
and i i understand what you're saying it's like understandable but at the same time

02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:27.340
they didn't that before they didn't do that before yeah so doing this right now it's like baffling

02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:33.500
and so many people are actually angry they're they're not putting anything in the game some

02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:39.100
up some many have happened too well but again it yeah it's i was just to say it is it is

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:45.820
interesting sometimes to see where the player base will break and say you know what and i'm

02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:50.940
talking in mass where the player brace bait breaks off and says you know what fuck this i'm out

02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:57.020
because another game i'm thinking of that recently had this happen is world of warcraft and this is

02:21:57.020 --> 02:22:01.580
this was happening before any of the activision blizzard stuff for the past few weeks so let's

02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:07.580
try try to now as i'm saying this not that that is not part of that it is now for some people

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:12.220
certainly but at the time people were still breaking off of world of warcraft in mass and it

02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:16.940
it seemed like it just seemed like the weirdest to from me who broke off world of warcraft eight

02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:21.980
years ago i was like now you're leaving world of warcraft like because they did something with

02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:27.980
sylvanas that was like i'm like the it's the story of the last few expansions has been pretty mad

02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:34.860
this is just weird that like now you're leaving okay but um now it's like with pokemon go it's

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:41.180
like hair across that's the thing that sets you off okay interesting but i'm just i'm i don't i

02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:45.740
don't mean that in a negative or condescending way it's just it's interesting to me what sets

02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:52.140
off the player base in mass sometimes i think uh not only the hair across thing but it's like

02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:59.740
the snowball getting bigger and bigger and again coming this coming after niantics like

02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:08.140
like like really really bad response i i don't want to go way further into my words but it was

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:14.940
a really bad response and even i and when when they put out the response they posted it i was

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:20.540
at least they responded they did something better than nothing but after seeing the hair across thing

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:29.420
is like yeah i cannot justify them anymore it's like i'm done with them but again it's like

02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:37.100
and and i was talking earlier this on my own um gff cast uh that i do not feel the like the

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:43.500
tinesing fallacy or whatever it's called because i have so many good memories of the game and

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:50.140
i have met so many awesome people through pokemon go it's like i have i have found so many communities

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:55.580
even like in on twitch it's like there's so many good stuff i have from the game that i have

02:23:56.140 --> 02:24:01.740
uh gotten from it it doesn't necessarily in the game so yeah i was i'll still play pokemon go

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:09.260
i'll do like again go battle league i'll do raids whenever i can when when i do have like free

02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:17.020
passes all that stuff but again i'm i'm not like really in the mood to put any money into it like

02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:24.060
like uh sj 100 mad saying like uh the the community days the one dollar thing it's like

02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:30.300
yeah i'm not gonna buy that i always buy it even if it sucks but now it's like i'm not gonna buy it

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:38.460
at all yeah so yeah it's like um and it's so it's like it's like it's a really easy fix it's not

02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:43.980
they're not necessarily talking about the game it's like gigantic just communicating to us like

02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:48.460
being a little bit more transparent if they're like expect and again that's returning to the

02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:55.020
heracross thing if they had said oh heracross is only gonna appear in raids at least we would know

02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:02.060
it's like okay we we understand okay it's whatever we'll wait if if we want if we are in the region

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:09.020
and all that stuff but like being so secretive for something like that it's like no no this

02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:14.060
that's not how we play let me ask this question before we wrap it all up because um we're gonna

02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:19.180
play the hypothetical world where um and i love this hypothetical world because the hypothetical

02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:24.540
world where rob is right so let's play in this hypothetical world where rob is right that uh

02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:30.860
what i said ends up happening the the 80 meters comes back but you're gonna burn out pokey stops

02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:35.420
after four spins for a four hour period i don't know something like that so let's say they kind

02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:41.980
of do like a halfway type of uh thing is that gonna bring you back into the fold or have we

02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:43.740
gone past the point of no return at this point

02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:55.740
it's like even if they actually do a radius thing like like even like if you say it's like it's

02:25:55.740 --> 02:26:01.020
going to be done like oh a burnout after first things like they do in english it's like it's

02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:07.100
the same on english if they do that the same as ingress it's like okay it's a compromise

02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:13.980
but we i still need to see more from them it's like we still have so many problems in the game

02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:23.020
uh and and like again go battle league the lag the the bugs all that stuff it's like still present

02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:31.820
in the game yeah uh so many many stuff in terms of uh of cash grabbing like the raids like the eggs

02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:42.620
there's so many things that need to be addressed at least that until they do that i will i will

02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:49.260
invest in the game of fair but until then yeah that's that's like no go even if they do that

02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:55.740
it's like no we have to at least keep a little bit of pressure into address at least them addressing

02:26:55.740 --> 02:27:00.540
all that you know what's really interesting and i i totally forgot to bring this up during my gaming

02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:05.340
week but i'll bring it up now on wednesday night i actually went to an ingress meetup and it was

02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:09.580
an official ingress meetup because you know there's a whole kind of separate team and group

02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:13.740
that's working on that and maybe you've even heard of this uh deafness some of it's probably you know

02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:17.580
crosses over and some stuff like oh well look what they're doing over on this side they have

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:22.860
that whole van tour or the xm detection van which is the whole thing of the ingress lore so they

02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:26.940
have this van traveling around right now it was just in portland yesterday and i think it's in

02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:32.860
boise on tuesday and it was just here in sac on uh wednesday so i actually went downtown and it

02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:36.540
was there was about 75 people there because you know ingress doesn't have quite the fan base that

02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:41.660
pokemon go does but it has its own loyal fan base right and um you know they they did their welcome

02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:45.020
and everything it was and part of i think why they're doing this is they're actually kind of

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:51.180
introducing like their new community manager for like ingress at niantic who's done um a good job

02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:55.180
so far i would say she had a really nice write-up about the event and she was really like engaging

02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:59.340
with people and you know so forth i thought she did a very good job with the event overall

02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.780
but i thought what was interesting is that when she was being introduced by the other guy

02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:07.980
he was like you know and uh you know let her know all your feedback that you have on ingress and

02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:12.300
you know all the other niantic stuff too if you have feedback on pokemon go or harry and you could

02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:18.380
just see her eyes kind of went like like shut up shut up don't no no i don't want to talk about

02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:28.380
the game because that was well it was she was at least uh but she uh i quit on friday yeah but

02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:33.980
the community matter for pokemon go actually quit yeah i heard that not the same person just to be

02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:38.860
clear but yes i heard that whole thing as well it's very interesting but i just a funny anecdote

02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:43.420
your story kind of or your your comment reminded me to tell about the whole like taking feedback

02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:46.620
like she's still kind of like you know smiling like sure i'll hear what you have to say because

02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:52.300
luckily it's only 75 people and most of them care primarily about ingress right but there's

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:56.860
there's a hell of a lot of overlap there were plenty of people wearing pokemon go shirts

02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:01.740
and i certainly have my little pokeball because we do what i call dual wielding we're playing

02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:05.820
ingress on our phone and we're bluetooth catching on the pokeball we're dual wielding the games so

02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:10.700
there's a lot of us that do play both so it's just uh i thought that i thought that was interesting

02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:16.140
how she she kind of was like i i've opened because that was the same day as that letter

02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:19.420
i think so i think she was very much like i want to talk about it i want to talk about it

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:24.940
i'm not i don't have my bullet points they probably knew if it was wednesday and the on the

02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:32.780
letter thing was thursday they oh they probably knew because the letter was made by influencers

02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:38.300
who worked with niantic on pokemon go anyway it was brewing it was brewing it was definitely like

02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:44.940
you knew like people were pissed so anyway uh mike deft uh the rebranded act f mike deaf thank

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:49.340

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:20.540
i tried to drag deft out of the chat and i ended up dragging the studio out of the chat

oh whoops for the record rob we don't have any emails oh yes i was gonna acknowledge there are

02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:31.820

02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:50.220
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's sterlock hey sterlock it is good to hear from you

02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:54.380
so i have a funny feeling because i know you called into bobby's show tonight i have a feeling

02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:59.820
we might hear a similar topic but that's that's okay yes that's okay this is this is a good thing

02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:03.900
for people to know about so tell us uh what's what what would you like to talk about tonight

02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:07.260
so uh it all started with some reddit thread um

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:23.420
a couple weeks ago i posted a thread on reddit uh asking if uh you know hearthstone could be

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:30.540
modded to be accessible and i got just quite a bit of sorry i don't mean to cut you off but i

02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:34.300
want to make sure our listeners who don't already know know because you've called into the show

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:39.500
before but admittedly in this covet age we haven't been taking a lot of phone calls for a bit so um i

02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:44.220
just want to make sure those that don't know know that you are a blind gamer and you've often called

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:49.260
into the show kind of talking about um games that have like awesome accessibility things like the

02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:54.380
last of us part two and um you know so forth and games are not so great accessibility because i

02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:59.260
think these are good things for us to sort of keep in mind is that hey there's lots of people

02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:04.380
out there that would like to play games but sometimes can't and so this is with you and

02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:08.380
hearthstone so sorry i just want to make sure people have that background yeah yeah yep no

02:32:08.380 --> 02:32:15.820
problem um and you know the the thread got quite a bit of traction and a lot of people are like oh

02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:21.740
that would actually be really cool and then you know there were some people that were interested

02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:26.140
and and you know thoughtful and but there are a lot of people were just like i don't know how this

02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:33.180
could be done and some people were even like well this might be against blizzard tos you know to add

02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:42.940
keyboard support um i can tell you that that's not going to be a concern um for reasons i'll get into

02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:52.460
later but um so that you know i that thread goes on for like a day day and a half and kind of

02:32:52.460 --> 02:33:01.100
fizzles out because you know reddit um and i didn't really you know think anything of it

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:08.860
it's like yeah you know it would have been cool if something came of it um but then i got a couple

02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:16.940
that someone a couple people added me on reddit like look at this and uh turns out somebody had

02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:24.780
already been working behind the scenes in secret for i guess months like completely independent of

02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:35.900
my thread to make hearthstone uh accessible to blind people nice and uh it's you know it's pretty

02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:43.820
you know it's pretty basic right now i mean it's it works very very well like battling works

02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:51.180
flawlessly um what is lacking currently is uh selecting other modes and deck editing

02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:56.060
and things like that but uh he wants to keep working on it and

02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:04.060
yeah so basically what this does is it interfaces with your screen reader and you have a lot of

02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:07.260
keyboard shortcuts to get to various parts of the field

02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:15.900
and uh sorry i think i interrupted you no you're fine you're fine i want to make sure you you get

02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:19.820
your piece out because i think it's important for people to know like you know kind of like

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:26.140
how this makes the experience um accessible for you um yeah but one thing i want to kind of with

02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:30.860
the with the terms of service and the tos that whole thing i think the last thing blizzard needs

02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:35.580
right now is a case on their hands where they shut down a mod that is making a game more accessible

02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:40.620
um that is not the pr story blizzard needs right now so like um this this this will be in the clear

02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:49.980
yeah no absolutely yeah well plus plus um there is a known blizzard uh developer oh named nikki

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:57.100
crenshaw uh who frequents a friend of mine uh super blind man uh he's a blind streamer

02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:07.420
uh he streamed this on on friday when it came out and she happened to tune in and uh saw this and

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:12.060
she was just over the moon and apparently she showed it around to the the office and people

02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:17.820
are just oh my gosh this is insane so that that those are those now that's good because

02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:22.540
especially if she was you know one person is one person but if she was showing other people in the

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:28.140
office now that's a conversation and that might lead to the whole well how did this guy do it

02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:32.540
maybe we should do this and blizzard does have a track record and from having covered world

02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:37.020
warcraft for years and years blizzard at least the old blizzard but i don't see why you know

02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:40.620
there's a lot of great people at blizzard still there's still yeah really good people at blizzard

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:45.660
even if some of the execs are crappy people exactly um and that's why that's why i don't

02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:52.460
feel bad about playing this and and supporting because there's also rumors that diablo 2 is

02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:58.620
going to be accessible so you can absolutely do both but i was going to say yeah wow wow did have

02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:04.300
that track record of if a mod was really popular they like deadly boss mods was like almost like

02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:09.020
a must-have mod for raid boss encounters they ended up yeah they ended up like incorporating

02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:13.980
some of that into the main game so they they do look at the mods out there and the stuff that's

02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:19.980
really popular they do have a tendency to kind of so that could bode very well for this um but let

02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:25.820
me we're hoping we're hoping we uh we're hoping that like they decide i don't know if they're

02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:31.980
going to but it would be awesome if uh you know blizzard you know gets a hold of them like hey

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:39.180
let's uh let's talk let's talk about how this works um let me ask you this though before uh

02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:42.860
you know because uh we do have to wrap things up here pretty soon but i want to make sure uh i get

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:48.060
your opinion you know accessibility issues aside now that you've had the chance to play hearthstone

02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:56.620
how do you like hearthstone as a game so good it's so good i just unlocked uh all the classes

02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:04.540
and uh still working on getting the initial levels you know up to 10 to get the core the core cards

02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:11.740
and uh i actually played a couple online matches even though so you can't i'm not gonna get into

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:17.180
specifics but there's a way with your screen reader even though it's not supported in the mod

02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:23.580
itself to get there accessibly there's a way to do it where you can get to um online matches so

02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:29.820
i've actually played a few uh online matches and so i'm kind of working on clawing my way out of

02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:37.660
apprentice which is the basically like the newbie ranks yeah um and you get more cards by by

02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:42.620
completing that so you know if nothing else i hope blizzard doesn't just hear about that i'm

02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:47.900
so happy it's accessible but i hope blizzard hears that enthusiasm when you said it's so good

02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:52.380
i hope that is what's heard where it's like hey by implementing something like this officially

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:56.780
you can make a lot of people say what you just said about hearthstone and i think that that

02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:02.380
should be the most exciting getting it is getting like it's spread around now like a lot of the

02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:09.740
blind community is playing it and is super excited about it so um yeah i i'm looking

02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:14.460
forward i'm looking forward to deck building and uh packet opening because those are things that

02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:22.940
are not currently uh accessible yet but uh hopefully soon all right well sterlock i'm

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:26.940
gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you i appreciate the update and uh what's

02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:30.700
going on there i think that's good stuff for people to know about and uh keep us posted on

02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:35.500
future um efforts for more games um to get those sorts of features i'd love to hear your take on

02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:42.540
it definitely all right take care of my friend yeah you too all right bye-bye all right and

02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:48.220
with that i think we are uh going to oh if i can find the right shot there there we go uh we're

02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:52.300
going to get into a few more segments here and then we're going to wrap up here uh let me get to

02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:55.740
last minute stories loki i don't know if you have anything tonight but do you have any last minute

02:38:55.740 --> 02:39:02.140
stories i did have one thing so there was a deal that happened this week between uh trade parker

02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:09.020
and matt stone with viacom cvs regarding south park so they're gonna be bringing like 14 movies

02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:16.700
um several seasons and a video game um in the works apparently so we're getting another south

02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:21.660
park video game at some point so that's pretty awesome i'm not surprised those games have done

02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:28.380
pretty well but i've it is interesting how is it that these animated series are on forever like

02:39:29.100 --> 02:39:35.580
south simpsons has been on forever uh south park uh forever family guy feels like it's been on

02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:40.060
forever uh futurama has got to be getting good is is that show still on i think that's getting

02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:45.100
canceled oh has it oh i feel like i'm still seeing it all the time so okay all right but still i feel

02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:49.260
like like wow there's a lot of animated shows that go on for a very long time but you know why this

02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:53.900
one's interesting because when i first read it and you know insert whatever joke you want about

02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:57.500
south park being relevant all this stuff look it's just i i just want to talk about the deal itself

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.740
the the whole fact that they they've commissioned 14 movies you know that whole thing is just a

02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:10.620
workaround right because hbo max through comedy central has the right to south park or no no

02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:15.260
because comedy central is part of viacom but hbo max or somehow has the deal for one way or another

02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:20.780
this is paramount plus or viacom leveraging their arm to get content for paramount plus

02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:24.620
so the shows are going to be on hbo max at least for a couple more years and now paramount plus

02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:28.860
is getting its own original content as well that's the part i think is fascinating about the deal

02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:34.300
how they kind of strong-armed their own content for paramount plus because yo drag race all-stars

02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:39.500
season six is going to be over in a few more weeks whenever they finish their game within a game so

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:45.980
it's time for new original content i guess huh i guess yeah yeah for sure that's cool

02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:51.260
yeah for sure um all right uh one other thing and yes thank you i'm glad you brought this up

02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:57.020

dot com slash discord if you want to join our discord and chat with us throughout the week

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:06.060
um as joe and her matt says thoughts on the cookie clicker i said cookie clitter i almost did

02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:11.980
cookie clicker remaster and yes that is they are remastering cookie clicker

02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:17.900
and bringing it back i don't know how to feel about it i would rather see a clicker heroes

02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:21.900
remaster because the sequel wasn't that good the sequel wasn't as good as the first one

02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:29.660
so that's uh that's what it is pixel pakas just put rob in all caps i can't help it

02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:39.820
rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob all right i can bring that back you know what's that

02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:46.860
i could bring that back you could you could um let's see uh there was a car or there was a

02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:52.060
question from no one special 77 earlier before we started in the phone calls here we go uh and i

02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:58.140
thought this was worth addressing real quick here in the spirit of the flag this week i'll ask this

02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:05.260
what's the weirdest game you personally have played and he didn't specify arcade so we've

02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:09.180
been talking about the weird arcade games through dark soccer segment maybe the weird

02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:14.300
console games that you've played what are some what's the weirdest console game you've played

02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:19.500
well the weirdest game i've played in the arcade isn't all that weird but uh probably prop cycle

02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:25.900
i love prop cycle i love it it's not it's not it's just an unusual game it's not like terrible

02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:31.260
not bad it's just fun i'll go one step further and say the prop cycle adams family that's what

02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:36.540
i was gonna say i was gonna say what the yeah the prop cycle adams family stop stealing a potential

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:46.700
idea well you said it first you stole it from me so they have a prop cycle ab family game like you

02:42:46.700 --> 02:42:53.180
power you you have to run the prop cycle to power the machine isn't it like that oh that okay i

02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:56.620
thought it was like an actual prop cycle game where you like fly around through like the adams

02:42:56.620 --> 02:43:01.100
family house or something like that i was like that sounds really cool why haven't i seen that

02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:04.540
but no that's that's different okay i'll talk about something not in the arcade you know what

02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:10.220
was a weird game nintendo dogs that game was a little weird i mean it was cute i'm not saying

02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:14.860
i'm not saying it wasn't cute i'm just saying it was happy petting sim and they didn't they didn't

02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:18.940
really take it as far as they should have in my opinion i'm surprised we never really got a true

02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:23.820
i know there was the nintendo dogs plus cats for the 3ds but i'm surprised we never got like a

02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:28.620
proper switch sequel and we just had all the knockoff stuff instead you know what else was

02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:33.740
connect the moles you know what are you not impressed by connect the moles here's another

02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:39.260
weird game the cooking mama game that mined bitcoin that's a weird game although that wasn't

02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:44.300
true but in in my brain my head canon is it was true cooking mama things like scribble knots

02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:50.460
oh that's a good one scribble knots is good there's a lot of scribble knots games man there's

02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:57.660
a all very strange oh magic pen gel that game yeah that legend at the apartment that loki and

02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:06.300
i used to live in absolutely time to penis all right i mean and let's not even start about uh

02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:25.660
interesting game yeah it was also that dream simulator game that came out that i played very

02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:33.340

02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:34.220
came off of my neck today from the surgery a couple weeks ago and i'm happy to say and

02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:39.900
i'm turning around for the camera here on twitch i'm happy to say it looks pretty fucking normal

02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:43.660
back there there's just a very thin red light you probably can't even see it on the camera at this

02:47:43.660 --> 02:47:47.740
point there's just a very thin red line and probably what's going to be a pretty bitching

02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:51.420
scar but it's really not much going on back there so that's pretty exciting

02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:58.380
and three in three more days i can get into pool again and submersion water so there's that all

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:03.020
