WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
You kids and your fancy M2 SSDs and your PlayStation 5s and your always on wireless

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
connections.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.720
Back in my day we had to run a cable from the kitchen to the living room, wait 30 seconds

00:19.720 --> 00:25.200
for a modem to dial, prevent anyone from being able to use the phone and suffer the consequences

00:25.200 --> 00:26.760
if someone tried to.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.560
And we liked it!

00:28.560 --> 00:30.240
This is your Old Man Yells at Cloud Update.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.440
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:33.440 --> 00:37.640
this millennium's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.640 --> 00:45.320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.320 --> 00:47.480
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.480 --> 00:54.460
It is another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 878 for this

00:54.460 --> 00:57.100
August the 1st of 2021.

00:57.100 --> 01:03.700
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you as always with my co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura

01:03.700 --> 01:04.700
or Jamie Summers.

01:04.700 --> 01:05.700
Oh, hi.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.700
Hello, how are you?

01:06.700 --> 01:07.700
Um, okay.

01:07.700 --> 01:15.380
It's been a busy, busy day, I was woken up by the sounds of the neighbors running power

01:15.380 --> 01:16.380
tools.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.380
Delightful.

01:17.380 --> 01:22.900
Oh boy, you gotta love power tools, love to hate them that is.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.700
I wanted to use the power tools on somebody's head.

01:26.700 --> 01:33.020
I have to go right to our chat room tonight because She-Hulk 10 is in there in chat and

01:33.020 --> 01:37.460
we love seeing She-Hulk every week, but with this comment that I actually didn't realize

01:37.460 --> 01:43.700
saying woohoo, MTV is 40 and that's right, that would be right.

01:43.700 --> 01:48.500
Not that I questioned She-Hulk's trivia, but I had that realization of like, oh my gosh,

01:48.500 --> 01:52.580
that's right because MTV started 1981, August 1st.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.980
And I watched it when it aired.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.940
I don't think we had it on our cable.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.220
We had cable at the time.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.220
Yeah.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.940
Like, uh, and they were doing like some deal where you got MTV like with your package.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.260
I barely remember this.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.780
Mind you, I was like five.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.500
Yes, I would have been three.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.340
So maybe I just am too young to remember it.

02:13.340 --> 02:23.300
But I remember my, my uncle, I think turning it on to see what it was and watching the

02:23.300 --> 02:29.340
first music video that they played, which, of course, was video killed the radio star.

02:29.340 --> 02:35.700
So what are we going to have have now Internet TV killed video?

02:35.700 --> 02:39.380
I think somebody made that song like Internet killed the video star.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.500
I think that was a thing.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.120
It might have been a parody or something.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.460
Maybe one of those songs that we used to play on the old network.

02:44.460 --> 02:47.700
But one of those songs they always attribute to Weird Al that he didn't do.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.700
Yeah.

02:48.700 --> 02:49.700
Yes.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.700
Yes.

02:50.700 --> 02:51.700
Like a mislabeled Napster file.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.700
Yes.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.460
Oh, he still jokes about that, apparently.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.740
Yes, exactly.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.740
But yeah.

02:58.740 --> 02:59.740
I now I distinctly.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.600
Why shouldn't why wouldn't they celebrate this with with they should celebrate this

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
with Al TV?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.660
Yes, they should.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.220
I remember Al TV.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.020
I distinctly remember that special.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.660
I think my dad thought he was funny and I thought he was funny, too.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.780
And I but I definitely remember that video.

03:16.780 --> 03:22.540
I remember seeing that video on MTV, that video killed the radio star because, I mean,

03:22.540 --> 03:27.380
in the very beginning of MTV, the first few weeks, there were only like nine music videos

03:27.380 --> 03:28.380
at all.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.780
It wasn't until much later that, you know, it caught fire that all these other record

03:32.780 --> 03:37.900
labels started doing more videos.

03:37.900 --> 03:43.060
I always remember Martha Quinn and Kennedy later on.

03:43.060 --> 03:44.060
Oh, yeah.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.060
I remember Kennedy.

03:45.060 --> 03:48.420
I talked to Kennedy once on a radio thing.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.420
Years and years and years.

03:49.420 --> 03:50.420
I was in high school.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.820
I used to religiously watch remote control.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.820
Oh, yeah.

03:53.820 --> 03:54.820
That was awesome.

03:54.820 --> 03:55.820
That was my jam.

03:55.820 --> 03:56.820
Yeah.

03:56.820 --> 04:04.780
And then, you know, it's what gave us liquid television, which was something I still kind

04:04.780 --> 04:05.780
of miss.

04:05.780 --> 04:10.460
There was another show that was on very briefly called The Idiot Box, and it had Alex Winter

04:10.460 --> 04:11.460
as the host.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.460
OK.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.700
And I think they they only aired like all of two episodes.

04:14.700 --> 04:19.820
But at the time, I was kind of a fan girl of Alex Winter.

04:19.820 --> 04:20.820
So I watched it.

04:20.820 --> 04:21.820
I mean, I thought it was pretty funny.

04:21.820 --> 04:29.340
But there's also another show that I think turned into the kids in the hall.

04:29.340 --> 04:30.340
The kids.

04:30.340 --> 04:33.500
I don't think because the whole started on MTV, but you might be thinking of the state

04:33.500 --> 04:34.500
because the state.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
That's what I'm thinking of the state.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
Yeah.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
The state has a different group.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.700
But a lot of those people went on to Reno 911.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.260
A lot of the same people are.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.660
I just remember the guy whose catchphrase is I want to stick my balls in it and he'd

04:46.660 --> 04:48.940
carry around his little balls.

04:49.060 --> 04:54.100
OK, believe it or not, we are a video game podcast, but the chat room is lighting up

04:54.100 --> 04:55.380
about MTV memories.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.380
So you know what?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
I'll indulge it.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.460
And to be remote control had an NES game that was awesome.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.100
And I loved it because I also love that show.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.900
That was my lifelong dream was to be the game show host of that show.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.500
It might still be.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
So fifth dream in our.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.700
I remember Colin Quinn on that show, too.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
Yes.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.580
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

05:15.580 --> 05:19.500
at the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network right after the Bobby

05:19.500 --> 05:20.820
Blackwell show.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.140
And you guys can chat along with our show, which fifth dream is saying some of those

05:24.140 --> 05:30.380
weird channel services like Pluto TV has a 24 hour pop up video station.

05:30.380 --> 05:34.620
Now pop up video, of course, is VH1 thing, but very closely related by MTV.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.260
But yeah, it's all it's all MTV.

05:36.260 --> 05:37.820
And I thought that was all part of Paramount.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.960
All the MTV shows are on Paramount Plus now.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.620
So I'm kind of surprised it's on Pluto.

05:41.620 --> 05:46.420
But actually, now now that I'm saying it out loud, I think Pluto is also a Viacom thing.

05:46.420 --> 05:47.860
It's just a very different thing.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.680
But this that Pluto TV app is on your PlayStation.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.100
It's on your Xbox.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.700
It's it's one of the this is a weird niche thing now.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.700
There's like three of them.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.980
These free TV apps.

05:59.980 --> 06:05.620
It's like old like it's basically commercially supported old ass movies like Netflix.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.860
So you don't have to pay a monthly fee for it.

06:07.860 --> 06:11.160
Or they also have like live TV.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.160
And they have very niche TV stations.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.440
Like there was one station on there that played nothing but RuPaul's Drag Race all day long.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.360
Just Drag Race, Marathon 24.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.840
I think they finally pulled it.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.080
I don't know why, but they did.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.680
But there was a Survivor one, too.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.680
And there's all sorts.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.680
There's an uncensored Hell's Kitchen, I think is on that same one.

06:28.680 --> 06:35.760
So anyway, there's also getting me to sit down and watch TV, which it doesn't happen

06:35.760 --> 06:38.520
unless it's Drag Race or Jessica Jones.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.520
Yeah.

06:39.520 --> 06:43.760
I think there's something to be said about turning on the TV and having that background

06:43.760 --> 06:47.040
noise while you're folding laundry or whatever it is.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.520
You know, sometimes you don't know what YouTube's for.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
Yeah.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
I think a lot.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.400
You know, but I think these like Pluto TV and the etc.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.200
I can't remember the names of the other ones.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.280
To be might be another one.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
I can't remember.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.280
Sorry, guys.

06:58.280 --> 07:03.040
That that kind of can also fill that with extremely niche things, kind of like how YouTube

07:03.040 --> 07:04.040
can do.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.760
You're absolutely right with that.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.260
And Pod Culture saying Pluto had a Doctor Who channel, the next generation.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.260
You're right.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.100
I think there's like a Star Trek channel on there.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.100
Absolutely.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
Yes.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.340
And the old school Nickelodeon channel is on one of those.

07:16.340 --> 07:19.940
As long as that showed the tomorrow people, I'd be interested.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.940
It might.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.940
It might.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.940
Look it up.

07:22.940 --> 07:23.940
Look it up.

07:23.940 --> 07:24.940
I want to see what else was.

07:24.940 --> 07:28.780
What if there was like old British sci fi, like it played like Blake seven or something?

07:28.780 --> 07:31.400
Honestly, it probably exists somewhere.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.540
It might not be on that same app, but I bet that of course, that's a niche that somebody

07:35.540 --> 07:38.240
you know who to ask our friends over British invaders.

07:38.240 --> 07:44.480
They would know he could send our pals over their email about that.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.240
Bobby Black Wolf speaking of an event where I sometimes see our friends, at least one

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
of our friends from British invaders.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.520
Bobby Black Wolf says our Dragon Con panel is called Video Didn't Kill the Podcast Star.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
So that's right.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
There's there's a panel.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.560
We're doing it again this year.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.720
We've done it at least one other year, maybe two.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.720
It's kind of about our transition from doing a long running podcast to the video format.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.720
So you're right.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.160
That name is kind of a little play on that as well.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.020
So it's pretty, pretty fun.

08:13.020 --> 08:17.840
So anyway, I should also mention, because you might be wondering, not joining us tonight

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
is Tech Master Loki.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.040
You might be like, where's Loki go?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.900
He just he had a family obligation.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.900
It happens sometimes.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.720
So he's just not here tonight, but he'll be back next week.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.380
So it happens.

08:28.380 --> 08:30.440
Sometimes we get to take a night off.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.480
So Loki, Loki has the night off, but he'll be back next week.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.160
So it's just dark Sakura and I feeling the love.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.800
So tonight's the night.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.560
It's just going to be the Dead by Daylight show.

08:39.560 --> 08:43.680
You already I'm still working on that, too.

08:43.680 --> 08:46.880
I need a co-host, maybe.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.280
Maybe we'll indulge a little bit tonight, because without Matt here, we kind of have

08:50.280 --> 08:54.400
a shorter list of stories that and I think it just kind of generally was.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.680
There's some big things you talk about, but the whole scope of things was a bit of a slower

08:58.680 --> 08:59.680
news week.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.540
And I think that's just, you know, summer still being in full swing and all of that

09:02.540 --> 09:03.540
stuff happening.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.540
What's that?

09:04.540 --> 09:05.540
Yeah.

09:05.900 --> 09:06.900
That's just how it is.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.900
Yes.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.900
Just how it is right now.

09:08.900 --> 09:09.900
Let's see.

09:09.900 --> 09:14.140
Bobby Black Wolf with a very good point saying, thanks to data caps, I'll never have a streaming

09:14.140 --> 09:16.940
channel on that I wasn't actively watching.

09:16.940 --> 09:17.940
That's a very good point.

09:17.940 --> 09:23.080
I don't watch a lot of the streaming stuff, but I'll watch it here and there.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.060
But Twitch is a lot of my background stuff, too.

09:26.060 --> 09:31.300
Like I'll put on a streamer that I like and I found a lot in the last few months ever

09:31.300 --> 09:36.060
since Alan got me into freaking Dead by Daylight, you know, and I kind of found that whole

09:36.060 --> 09:37.380
community in dark soccer.

09:37.380 --> 09:41.340
I know this hits home for you, too, is it's like there's I don't know how I got so deep

09:41.340 --> 09:42.340
with these people.

09:42.340 --> 09:46.420
It's just endless amounts of content out there with all of that.

09:46.420 --> 09:52.400
So well, and it's like now it's it's like, you know, I never, ever expected that when

09:52.400 --> 09:57.540
I go into one of the the bigger guys chat rooms that I'd get, oh, hi, welcome in.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.460
I'm glad that you made it to me.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.460
Yeah.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.500
I'm like, are we friends?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.020
This is great.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.020
Are we friends?

10:05.020 --> 10:08.660
Which is interesting, Jamie, because to pretty much, you know, a lot of people that are here

10:08.660 --> 10:13.400
on Sunday night, you you are a rock star and have been for many, many, many years.

10:13.400 --> 10:18.180
So to be to be acknowledged by you for a lot of people here.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.260
And I'm not trying to I'm not trying to completely gaslight you here, but I think this is like

10:21.260 --> 10:26.940
one of those like, you know, in these parts, I when Senpai notices them, there's a lot

10:26.940 --> 10:28.200
of people that are very happy.

10:28.200 --> 10:32.820
So it's just it's it's neat that there are other I notice all of you chatters.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.280
So Senpai noticed you.

10:34.280 --> 10:39.200
Yeah, I actually it's funny, I'm I'm working on and this is just like a little aside.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.200
I'm working on some bit redeems for my channel.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.560
You know, like cheap stuff, right?

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
And one of them is Senpai notice me.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.560
That's cute.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.560
I like that.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.200
I like I like the release.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.700
I'm having like I don't stream a lot, a lot on my personal channel.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.140
You know, I keep saying I need to do it more, but it's hard when Alan and I are sharing

10:59.140 --> 11:02.780
that space and especially in the summer when it gets really hot.

11:02.780 --> 11:06.220
But I think about those types of things and what to do for those regimes.

11:06.220 --> 11:10.660
And I do like the streamers that have these really cute, like short little things that

11:10.660 --> 11:14.460
they do, like one streamer that I watch a lot, does a little thing where he'll just

11:14.460 --> 11:15.800
go boop and that's it.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.380
That's like basically what you're doing.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.380
And there's that's Nick.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.380
Nick.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.380
Yeah.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.380
There's another one that'll get up.

11:22.380 --> 11:27.060
Yesterday, one that Alan watches a lot, that'll just get up and hug like to stand up and do

11:27.060 --> 11:28.060
a hug.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.060
I like that.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.060
That's cute.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.300
There's some Laurie Bird does the vocoder singing.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.580
Oh, that's cute.

11:34.580 --> 11:35.580
That is really cute.

11:35.580 --> 11:42.380
But but no, I've I you know, I've learned a lot actually just in playing Dead by Daylight

11:42.380 --> 11:46.780
and about the stream set ups and everything from just watching other people and talking

11:46.780 --> 11:47.780
to them.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.140
I'm still behind on quite a few things because I game on a Mac.

11:51.140 --> 11:54.340
You know, they're like, I can't run like chat bot.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.940
I have to run cloud bot, you know, and I figure some stuff out.

11:56.940 --> 11:58.980
I can't do some of the games.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.980
And slabs is garbage.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.460
Slobs, I'm sorry.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.820
Well, by garbage, I mean, it doesn't see my stadia window.

12:06.820 --> 12:15.140
And I do most of my gaming through stadia, which because of you, because I think it was

12:15.140 --> 12:21.340
you that that suggested that I start putting stadia in my tags when I go live.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.580
I have met other stadia Dead by Daylight players.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.260
I am no longer alone in the world.

12:27.260 --> 12:28.260
Thank you.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.260
Thank you.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.260
Thank you.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.260
Yes, that was me.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.260
I know.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.500
I remember suggesting that because I said you have it.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.060
You're a special snowflake in the stadia thing.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.060
And I wasn't.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.060
But I will say this.

12:39.060 --> 12:41.820
I didn't think it would be other Dead by Daylight state.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.420
I thought it would just be stadia enthusiasts.

12:44.420 --> 12:48.100
There were a couple that were just stadia, but a couple were also dead by daylight.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.100
Huh?

12:49.100 --> 12:50.100
Well, there you go.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.100
Yeah.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.140
So other people are familiar with Miss Debbie.

12:53.140 --> 13:01.300
I do find that I have good luck with the growth of my channel when I try not to stream one

13:01.300 --> 13:02.300
thing.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.340
Like, I don't get a lot of new followers when I play Final Fantasy 14 because I always play

13:05.340 --> 13:06.900
Final Fantasy 14.

13:06.900 --> 13:11.460
But like, one of the best nights I got a lot of new followers was when I did No Man's Sky

13:11.460 --> 13:13.140
out of the blue for the first time.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.780
I got people that watch a lot of No Man's Sky where it's like, oh, this is a new name.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.420
Who is this doing this?

13:18.420 --> 13:24.060
And I know this happens to Alan started playing his music games on Monday nights.

13:24.060 --> 13:27.100
And he gets a lot like that spin rhythm.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.540
He just randomly started playing on stage apparently has a rabid fan community behind

13:30.540 --> 13:31.540
it.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.220
Because when he streams that game, he gets all these new people that show up that will

13:34.220 --> 13:37.640
that are looking for that game particularly and all the mods behind it and everything.

13:37.640 --> 13:45.400
So it is it is interesting how I find that mixing that up does kind of let you get seen

13:45.400 --> 13:47.920
by more people because your keywords change.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.920
Right.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.800
So when when I beat Fantasian because I'm getting close to that.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
Oh, I bet.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.960
I need to think of something new for for Tuesday fantasy zone.

13:56.960 --> 14:03.160
So maybe I'll do Hataful Boyfriend again, or maybe I'll find something else who knows

14:03.160 --> 14:04.720
you want my suggestions.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.920
Do you want my honest suggestion live on air, even though, you know, you didn't ask for

14:08.920 --> 14:09.920
it?

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
Sure.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.440
We to me, Dark Soccer and chat room, feel free to agree, disagree.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.800
To me, Dark Soccer, you're the queen of retro gaming.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.960
It's one of the huge things that like you bring to the show, your knowledge, your depth,

14:20.960 --> 14:26.520
your fandom for these sometimes downright obscure things that not the rest of us really

14:26.520 --> 14:27.760
like know a lot about.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.480
Like I am surprised you don't stream more retro.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.860
I realize the setup.

14:31.860 --> 14:33.940
You don't have the right capture stuff for that setup.

14:33.940 --> 14:38.140
But I would almost say just cheat and use emulators because emulate it.

14:38.140 --> 14:39.140
Yeah.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.460
Chances are you own it.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.020
So you're not really breaking the rules.

14:43.020 --> 14:48.180
Like I might I might try to dig up, see if there's a version of Magic Engine that runs

14:48.180 --> 14:54.540
and play through one of those translated like Rondo of Blood or something.

14:54.540 --> 14:55.540
Yeah.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.540
I think that would be fun.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.540
Yeah.

14:58.540 --> 15:03.780
Of course, it's just going to be me playing as Maria with her terrible singing.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.620
But there's a lot of people that are probably never even seen it.

15:06.620 --> 15:10.980
So you know, there was a Castlevania collection, though it had it on there.

15:10.980 --> 15:11.980
Oh, that's right.

15:11.980 --> 15:12.980
That's right.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.980
Yeah.

15:13.980 --> 15:18.980
So although I actually do kind of want to play, I've also been thinking about maybe

15:18.980 --> 15:22.180
playing Jackie Crush.

15:22.180 --> 15:26.820
Which is in the Devil's Crush family.

15:26.820 --> 15:29.100
It was a SNES one that came out.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.700
Wow.

15:31.700 --> 15:32.700
That would be awesome.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.700
Yeah.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.700
Mike Defton Chats is at this point.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.700
I don't think most people will care if you use emulators.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.700
No.

15:36.700 --> 15:41.340
And especially if it's like the stepping stone to, you know, going, OK, there is interest

15:41.340 --> 15:42.340
in this.

15:42.340 --> 15:46.200
And now maybe I will make that investment in whatever capture card I need to hook up

15:46.200 --> 15:48.400
the old Saturn or whatever it is.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.860
I think that, you know, might be might be a way to do it.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.700
So that'd be great if I can do Saturn emulation on my Mac.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.700
That would be awesome.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.700
Yeah.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.580
Food for thought.

15:57.580 --> 15:58.580
All right.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.660
We're we're several minutes into the show and we haven't even gotten to the kickoff

16:00.660 --> 16:01.660
topic.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.860
But that's that's what happens when Loki isn't here to mediate us.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.340
We will just talk about whatever we want.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.900
I just picture his flat stare while we're jabbering and who am I?

16:09.900 --> 16:10.900
Who am I kidding?

16:10.900 --> 16:15.620
He's he's going to get off topic just as much so that's part of the charm here at Orange

16:15.620 --> 16:16.620
Lounge Radio.

16:16.620 --> 16:17.620
It is what it is.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.620
All right.

16:18.620 --> 16:19.900
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.380
Actually, we kind of have a you know, this is eight hundred and seventy eight episodes

16:23.380 --> 16:24.660
Orange Lounge Radio.

16:24.660 --> 16:28.140
We've been doing the format with the kickoff topic at least as long as we've been on Twitch,

16:28.140 --> 16:29.220
if not longer.

16:29.220 --> 16:32.900
This doesn't happen a lot where the same thing needs to be talked about at the top of the

16:32.900 --> 16:36.660
show two weeks in a row sometimes, but not a lot.

16:36.660 --> 16:41.340
We're in that position tonight because this is a very important shift in the industry

16:41.340 --> 16:42.340
that's happening right now.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.380
This is a very important reckoning for the industry.

16:45.380 --> 16:50.660
And you notice I'm not saying one company, I'm saying the industry that I is playing

16:50.660 --> 16:53.080
out through one company right now.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.240
But Dark Soccer, if you don't mind, I will let you take it from here.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.560
Oh, yeah.

16:57.560 --> 17:08.840
So on this past Wednesday, hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees walked out and this was

17:08.840 --> 17:18.960
after the lawsuit and Blizzard's rather dismissive release on terms.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.780
You know, they're oh, we're sorry, but blah, blah, blah.

17:21.780 --> 17:26.000
You don't say I'm sorry, but you say I'm sorry and don't do the shit again.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.500
So at any rate, there was a walk out where they rallied in front of the Blizzard headquarters

17:34.500 --> 17:41.980
in Irvine to protest their response to the discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit.

17:41.980 --> 17:47.460
It was attended by more than 350 people.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.120
There were some signs out.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.580
One of them said nerf male privilege.

17:52.580 --> 17:57.720
Another one said unaccountable corporate bureaucrats are driving the best employees out of Activision

17:57.720 --> 17:59.360
Blizzard.

17:59.360 --> 18:05.500
The walkout started at 10 a.m. Pacific and ended at 2 p.m.

18:05.500 --> 18:12.080
Also other companies were supporting the employees and actually sent food trucks out and catered

18:12.080 --> 18:13.340
and brought porta potties.

18:13.340 --> 18:15.980
Oh, I hadn't heard of that.

18:15.980 --> 18:16.980
Interesting.

18:17.500 --> 18:26.780
People were driving by and honking in support and there were people that spoke out about

18:26.780 --> 18:39.080
it, but they wanted an anonymity for fear of retribution from the company.

18:39.080 --> 18:45.940
And then, of course, on social media, there was, of course, a call to not cross the virtual

18:45.940 --> 18:48.880
picket line by playing their games.

18:48.880 --> 18:54.800
That's including Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty.

18:54.800 --> 19:01.940
And honestly, I don't think I have played an Activision Blizzard game since the deal

19:01.940 --> 19:08.580
with the Chinese gamer with the free Hong Kong.

19:08.580 --> 19:15.040
But yeah, I am completely with this kind of behavior, I don't care how much you love a

19:15.040 --> 19:22.700
game, you know, this is something this gross behavior.

19:22.700 --> 19:30.380
I mean, they say that boycotts don't really do a lot, but I think the walkout will do

19:30.380 --> 19:31.820
quite a bit.

19:31.820 --> 19:40.140
And I do think that people making an active and vocal choice not to put their money into

19:40.140 --> 19:48.860
the company, while it may not be financially effective, I think it will be effective in

19:48.860 --> 19:49.860
terms of commentary.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.360
Does that make sense?

19:51.360 --> 19:52.360
Yes.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.360
And I think the good thing about the walkout, especially too, was something we were talking

19:56.360 --> 20:04.040
about last week about how this is not a every Blizzard and Activision employee problem.

20:04.040 --> 20:08.920
In fact, there are a lot of fantastic people working for Activision Blizzard who are sick

20:08.920 --> 20:10.520
and tired of this crap as well.

20:10.520 --> 20:15.960
And I think that walkout really sort of personified that, and I think helped a lot of people out

20:15.960 --> 20:21.280
there who maybe hadn't gotten to that point yet really see that this is not an issue of

20:21.280 --> 20:23.220
all the employees at Activision Blizzard.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.180
This is a management issue.

20:25.180 --> 20:30.520
I'm going to make a more extreme comparison though, and there were a lot of people that

20:30.520 --> 20:36.720
didn't vote in the 2016 election, were they good people?

20:36.720 --> 20:38.720
Because they partly enabled you-know-who.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.720
Debatable.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.940
But that my point stands.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.660
Every scenario is different, right?

20:46.660 --> 20:49.640
There are good people that do nothing.

20:49.640 --> 20:56.240
I'm glad they're doing something now that they feel empowered to do it, but there needs

20:56.240 --> 21:03.600
to be a degree of fearlessness when it comes to confronting any sort of abusive and oppressive

21:03.600 --> 21:04.600
behavior.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
Right.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.320
At some point it becomes damn the consequences.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.320
Right.

21:09.320 --> 21:13.280
But and I think that's where you kind of see the industry sort of inching closer and closer

21:13.280 --> 21:19.920
to probably some type of unionization or at least maybe like some type of like representation

21:19.920 --> 21:24.520
where there's like a legal defense sort of thing for the you know, because you just said

21:24.520 --> 21:29.320
it a minute ago is that there were some people speaking out with anonymity because they feared

21:29.320 --> 21:30.400
repercussions.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.620
So that whole thing is still a very valid threat looming for a lot of people.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.520
And we all know that shouldn't exist.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.440
That shouldn't in a perfect world that shouldn't exist.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.280
Unfortunately, you know, some people really still feel it does.

21:43.280 --> 21:47.220
So at least there needs to be that banding of employees.

21:47.220 --> 21:51.920
You know, I think it ought to just be a union, but at least let's take those baby steps in

21:51.920 --> 21:58.300
that direction of some type of like legal defense, a wall together that, you know, we

21:58.300 --> 22:02.660
are able to speak out when we see these things without repercussion.

22:02.660 --> 22:07.560
And maybe, sorry, real quick, maybe that's something that we go to our government.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.500
And I harped on this a lot last week where we applaud the government making these changes

22:11.500 --> 22:14.140
in the right direction and taking this action that they took.

22:14.140 --> 22:15.140
Sorry, Jamie, go ahead.

22:15.140 --> 22:23.020
Well, I was saying that that there were Ubisoft employees also who decided to step up in light

22:23.020 --> 22:24.800
of this.

22:24.800 --> 22:31.240
And there was an open letter in solidarity with Activision Blizzard employees, and they

22:31.240 --> 22:35.580
sent it to their CEO, Yves Guillemot.

22:35.580 --> 22:40.300
It is clear from the frequency of these reports that there is a widespread and deeply ingrained

22:40.300 --> 22:43.400
culture of abusive behavior within the industry.

22:43.400 --> 22:47.800
It should no longer be a surprise to anyone, employees, executives, journalists or fans

22:47.800 --> 22:51.040
that these heinous acts are going on.

22:51.040 --> 22:59.280
And it called for the employees of Ubisoft, Blizzard, other leaders in the industry to

22:59.280 --> 23:04.780
get together and, quote, agreed to a set of rules and processes for handling reports of

23:04.780 --> 23:05.780
these offenses.

23:05.780 --> 23:06.780
Bingo.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.300
The company shouldn't be doing this.

23:08.300 --> 23:12.520
This is going to require a bigger touch.

23:12.520 --> 23:20.440
And then there was another another employee of Blizzard, Sabrina Brogan, who informed

23:20.440 --> 23:26.560
the Activision Blizzard King Women's Network that she was going to step down as the network's

23:26.560 --> 23:35.360
Europe, Middle East and Africa lead after seeing this email from.

23:35.360 --> 23:40.200
Let's see, from their chief complaint from Blizzard's chief compliance officer, Francis

23:40.200 --> 23:41.200
Townsend.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.040
Oh, we got to talk about her.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.040
She got to go.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.000
She's got to go.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.620
Where the lawsuit was called a distorted and untrue picture of our company.

23:52.620 --> 23:59.120
And and the reason why Sabrina stepped down is because Townsend is also the executive

23:59.120 --> 24:01.720
sponsor for the Women's Network.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.880
And so she resigned.

24:04.880 --> 24:11.440
She means Brogan resigned and and she put out the message saying, I am ashamed I am

24:11.440 --> 24:14.520
working for this company.

24:14.520 --> 24:19.560
Fran Townsend, by the way, if you look at her Twitter account at Fran Townsend made

24:19.560 --> 24:22.200
a tweet on July 30th.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.960
So this was not an old thing dug up to use against her now.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.680
July 30th of this year.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.100
So two days ago.

24:31.100 --> 24:36.280
She tags two people and puts and the problem with whistleblowing by the Atlantic and links

24:36.280 --> 24:41.280
to an article titled The New Moral Code of America's Elite.

24:41.280 --> 24:50.240
So she tweets an article about the problem with whistleblowers.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.680
She's she needs to and this is this is odd.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
She's corporate garbage.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.160
Because I should be saying we need to uplift.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.520
We need to uplift women.

24:59.520 --> 25:04.560
We need to, you know, have more women in these types of positions and so forth.

25:04.560 --> 25:08.180
But unfortunately, gang, not this one.

25:08.180 --> 25:12.780
My tweet to her was you are the problem.

25:12.780 --> 25:17.860
Bobby Blackwell points out, if you can look at her Twitter account, she's blocking everyone,

25:17.860 --> 25:20.100
including her fellow co-workers.

25:20.100 --> 25:26.600
She needs to pack her boxes and leave, as a lot of people do at Activision Blizzard

25:26.600 --> 25:28.140
in the management district.

25:28.140 --> 25:35.140
Honestly, I'm surprised that people aren't actually actively reporting her account.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.140
Anyway.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.140
Yeah.

25:37.180 --> 25:41.260
Some folks in chat, she says, yeah, she has to go.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.260
Terrible lady.

25:42.260 --> 25:43.260
Yeah.

25:43.260 --> 25:48.380
And it's I think it's an example of you can still, you know, actively be working against

25:48.380 --> 25:54.060
the, you know, group that you're a part of that you're supposed to be uplifting.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.060
Yeah.

25:55.060 --> 26:00.020
As you heard, Matt says she also sent that company wide email shaming people for whistleblowing.

26:00.020 --> 26:04.300
Even Bobby Kotick criticized her stance.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.140
Bobby Kotick replied to this whole thing.

26:06.140 --> 26:09.300
It took him a few days.

26:09.300 --> 26:13.020
I don't want to compliment it, but I will say this.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.920
At least he outlined some steps.

26:15.920 --> 26:21.100
I'm not sure they were the right steps overall, especially when you consider some of the companies

26:21.100 --> 26:22.500
they're saying they're working with.

26:22.500 --> 26:26.340
So again, I'm going to be very careful how much of a gold star I'm going to get.

26:26.340 --> 26:33.840
I'm giving one gold piece of glitter for at least this actually says, here are some actionable

26:33.840 --> 26:38.520
steps we're going to take, which is more than you might have taken down that post.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.520
No.

26:39.520 --> 26:45.160
Well, I'm looking at it right now on my phone, unless she did it between the time the show

26:45.160 --> 26:48.160
started and now, which is certainly possible because I'm sure she's getting a lot of shit

26:48.160 --> 26:49.160
for it.

26:49.160 --> 26:57.480
Um, I will screenshot that bad boy and I'm going to send it to my friend, Dark Sakura.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
And I'm going to do that one more time.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
I just blocked her.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
Okay.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.080
Now you'll never find it.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.080
All right.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.320
There you go.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.320
Well, you sent me a screenshot.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.320
So that's different.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
You're right.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
I did.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
Um, screenshots are forever.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.320
Yeah.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.880
Oh, what a, yeah, I'm going to say it.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
What a cunt.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
Seriously.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.880
All right.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.880
We'll just leave it at that.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.880
Anyway.

27:21.880 --> 27:25.880
Um, anything else you want to mention or, or chat wants to mention about this, uh, ongoing

27:25.880 --> 27:26.880
story?

27:27.680 --> 27:38.440
Um, well, I was looking at just some of the stuff about, uh, codex, um, letter and I like,

27:38.440 --> 27:45.200
I like this, um, uh, quote, uh, from, it says, while we are pleased to see that our collective

27:45.200 --> 27:49.740
voices have convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications, this response

27:49.740 --> 27:53.880
fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.880
That's the crux of it.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.880
Yeah.

27:55.880 --> 27:58.080
Um, that, that's why I gave a gold piece of glitter.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
Yeah.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.000
Just one tiny little gold, gold thing.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.960
Um, but there are other parts of it such as, and as chat points out, uh, Mike Deaf saying

28:05.960 --> 28:09.480
granted Bobby Kotick also brought the anti-union firm to activists.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.800
That's why I'm going to refrain from getting a gold star or anything further.

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
Yeah.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.800
Um, but one piece of gold glitter, I mean, Hey, you know what?

28:16.800 --> 28:22.040
He gets a star drawn in a gold jelly ink on cardboard.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.040
You know what?

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
You know what they say?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.120
A broken clock is right twice a day.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.520
And I think in some of these scenarios, it's like, okay, congrats.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
Yay.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
You did it.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.520
You were right today.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
Congrats.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.520
Thanks, captain obvious.

28:33.520 --> 28:36.420
You should at least call that out because you know.

28:36.420 --> 28:43.720
What we need, and I, I, I understand some of my audience, right?

28:43.720 --> 28:47.660
We need fewer male voices in the industry.

28:47.660 --> 28:54.600
We need the men to stop talking about it and listen to the women talk about it.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.080
I would agree in the sense of that, all the decision makers should not be men.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.080
Period.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.720
Uh, and we need, we mean, we have need more diversity in management period.

29:04.720 --> 29:12.040
Well, I'm just saying though, that instead of spotlighting, you know, these men in upper

29:12.040 --> 29:20.160
management who, I mean, I would grant that many of them are probably just saying what

29:20.160 --> 29:24.720
needs to be heard to stay, you know, profitable.

29:24.720 --> 29:31.920
I'm going to say it, but I think that we need to hear more of the people that's experienced

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
it.

29:32.920 --> 29:38.360
We need to hear from the women who have been fired or abused.

29:38.360 --> 29:44.380
We need to hear their voices and need to listen to them.

29:44.380 --> 29:47.840
Critical myth and chat says these companies need a flush of upper management at the very

29:47.840 --> 29:48.840
least.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.640
We need to be flushed down the toilet.

29:50.640 --> 29:57.760
That's my, it's weird to say, but my hope is that that, that storms are coming.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.440
Oh, it is that.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.960
That's my hope.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.680
Not that any, not that any of this is good news.

30:04.680 --> 30:09.020
I mean, if we look at the Activision Blizzard and the complaints, a woman died like that's

30:09.020 --> 30:12.160
a woman died because of it's even worse.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.040
She apparently took her life.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
Yeah.

30:15.240 --> 30:24.720
So there's, there's no good news here, but if there's something that you can go, maybe

30:24.720 --> 30:27.920
change will happen this time.

30:27.920 --> 30:36.320
Well, and then there was that whole post about, um, uh, on the verge about the Cosby suite.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.320
Oh yeah.

30:37.320 --> 30:44.280
That's so, Oh, that when I just seeing the picture.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.840
So I'm going to tell you something about autism.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.840
Okay.

30:49.840 --> 30:53.960
Sometimes it's possible to feel so much emotion that all of them shut off.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.740
I don't get like that very, very often.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.120
I was like that.

30:58.120 --> 31:08.800
I could not feel anything and I couldn't talk for a while because it angered and frustrated

31:08.800 --> 31:12.780
me so much that my, my feelings just shut completely down.

31:12.780 --> 31:13.780
I shut down.

31:14.020 --> 31:15.020
That's how mad I got.

31:15.020 --> 31:18.980
Somebody else in chat, I'm sorry, I forgot who said, I couldn't even finish the article

31:18.980 --> 31:19.980
said that in chat.

31:19.980 --> 31:20.980
Yeah.

31:20.980 --> 31:25.980
So I, I, I think there's a lot of people, um, definitely feeling some sort of way from

31:25.980 --> 31:26.980
that article.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
It was, it was gross.

31:27.980 --> 31:30.260
Um, it's absolutely disgusting.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.780
And all of those faces in there.

31:31.780 --> 31:37.380
I want every last one of those people identified and made public.

31:37.380 --> 31:38.940
I think that's already happened.

31:38.940 --> 31:39.940
Uh, for sure.

31:39.940 --> 31:44.460
Now because, uh, Oh yes, because one of them works at riot now, one of them was ghost crawler

31:44.460 --> 31:48.620
and he's at riot now and had to put out this whole letter that he sent to his riot folks

31:48.620 --> 31:52.540
saying, Hey, this article came out and I want to apologize for this and kind of like kind

31:52.540 --> 31:53.540
of set his stance.

31:53.540 --> 31:57.100
But it's one of those things where it's like, apologize cause he got caught.

31:57.100 --> 32:01.020
It's just one of those things where it's like, you know, even if it is from 2013 or whatever

32:01.020 --> 32:05.260
eight years ago or something, there's just not a lot that can be said to justify it.

32:05.260 --> 32:09.060
Like I, and here's the thing, and I, I just, just to put it out there.

32:09.060 --> 32:14.980
I have, I have heard the whole, well, that picture was from 2013 and the Bill Cosby stuff

32:14.980 --> 32:21.140
didn't come out till 2015 but I think to go that route sort of misses the overarching

32:21.140 --> 32:22.140
point.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.460
And let's go back to that lawsuit.

32:23.460 --> 32:26.100
We're going to go back to that lawsuit.

32:26.100 --> 32:29.700
Why did Activision Blizzard get slapped on the wrist by the state in the first place?

32:29.700 --> 32:33.460
It was that frat boy culture.

32:33.460 --> 32:40.540
And what do I see when I hear about the luxury suite where all the male employees go to drink

32:40.540 --> 32:42.100
once BlizzCon is over?

32:42.100 --> 32:43.140
What is that?

32:43.140 --> 32:45.100
No matter what it's called.

32:45.100 --> 32:46.940
That's frat boy culture.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.980
That absolutely is.

32:48.980 --> 32:58.740
Well, and SSJ 100 Matt basically does make a point.

32:58.740 --> 33:04.380
Many female voices like, okay, so Jade Raymond gets spotlight constantly, but many female

33:04.380 --> 33:07.140
voices like her get death threats and harass so much.

33:07.140 --> 33:08.660
It's a culture problem that needs to be fixed.

33:08.660 --> 33:14.300
I don't know how to fix it other than giving more to uplift those voices and hold people

33:14.300 --> 33:15.300
accountable.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.500
And that's exactly it.

33:16.500 --> 33:24.660
But the thing is, is that if enough, if enough people raise their voice, if enough people

33:24.660 --> 33:27.620
step out, they can't stop all of us.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.500
That's 100% it.

33:30.500 --> 33:34.100
And this is what you, because I don't think anybody here does that garbage.

33:34.100 --> 33:38.380
If you do, all I have to say is that you're in the wrong place or you need to change your

33:38.380 --> 33:41.700
behavior immediately, period.

33:41.700 --> 33:47.140
But I think what we all can do, all of us here at OLR, VoG, all of us decent people

33:47.140 --> 33:53.060
in the gaming industry of which there are more of us than the other side, trust.

33:53.060 --> 33:59.700
What we have to do, even though it is uncomfortable sometimes, we have to stop giving our passive

33:59.700 --> 34:06.180
approval to those sorts of comments directed at Jade Raymond and women, et cetera, by saying

34:06.180 --> 34:08.220
nothing.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.460
Speak up and call out.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.760
You have to speak up.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.240
You have to call out.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.300
Exactly it.

34:14.300 --> 34:18.740
And I'm not saying sit down and shut up just because they are a woman.

34:18.740 --> 34:24.820
You are able to be critical of women when they do, you know, such as what's her name

34:24.820 --> 34:25.820
that I just said?

34:25.820 --> 34:26.820
I get fired.

34:26.820 --> 34:27.820
Fran Townsend.

34:27.820 --> 34:28.820
OK.

34:28.820 --> 34:29.980
When there is a.

34:29.980 --> 34:36.680
But notice, I'm not sitting here going, you know, F that B, even though I kind of feel

34:36.680 --> 34:37.680
that way.

34:37.680 --> 34:38.680
But you know what I mean?

34:38.680 --> 34:39.680
I said it.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.680
I know.

34:40.680 --> 34:44.060
But there's there's more substance behind it.

34:44.060 --> 34:47.180
You have a reason to be able to say that.

34:47.180 --> 34:54.980
That is not just she's a woman and therefore she should be in the kitchen and baby, whatever,

34:54.980 --> 34:55.980
all that.

34:55.980 --> 34:56.980
All the bullshit.

34:56.980 --> 34:57.980
What she needs to do is be in a dungeon.

34:57.980 --> 34:58.980
Just say it.

34:58.980 --> 35:00.860
And not even the fun kind.

35:00.860 --> 35:01.860
Anyhow.

35:01.860 --> 35:02.860
Yeah.

35:02.860 --> 35:07.620
My Deft in Chat says everything about that room is horrible.

35:07.620 --> 35:08.620
Talking about the Cosby Street.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.620
Sorry.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.620
Go ahead.

35:10.620 --> 35:13.500
But but I mean, maybe we should make this a campaign.

35:13.500 --> 35:18.420
You know, the the speak up and call out.

35:18.420 --> 35:24.440
Maybe that should be like a campaign or something that that we start and spread around.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.600
We make it a thing.

35:25.600 --> 35:31.660
I think if every one of us goes out, you know, even the people listening right now, the people

35:31.660 --> 35:39.180
listening to the the recording afterwards to the podcast, if everyone just stops and

35:39.180 --> 35:43.460
calls for it, you know, the word could spread, you know, call for it.

35:43.460 --> 35:44.980
Ask other people to call for it.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.320
Step up, you know, step up to it.

35:47.320 --> 35:50.700
It nothing changes until you make it change.

35:50.700 --> 35:51.700
Right.

35:51.700 --> 35:56.700
And if you sit there on your ass, go, oh, I agree her and don't do shit.

35:56.700 --> 35:57.700
Guess what you get for it?

35:57.700 --> 35:58.700
You get shit.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.700
Yeah, nothing.

35:59.700 --> 36:02.980
If you don't change, you're always going to get the same result.

36:02.980 --> 36:10.380
And that's this is this is a theme you're hearing amongst lots of things the past couple

36:10.380 --> 36:15.320
of years, because it is that it's that whole talk about we need the folks in the position

36:15.320 --> 36:18.340
of privilege to be able to speak out.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.340
Right.

36:19.340 --> 36:24.440
So for it to use and to use an analogy to talk about something directly where this applies

36:24.440 --> 36:25.960
in another place.

36:25.960 --> 36:31.480
So when we talk about Black Lives Matter, right, then if I believe that Black Lives

36:31.480 --> 36:37.620
Matter and I do and I want to, you know, support, you know, all of the my my friends that are

36:37.620 --> 36:45.140
black and everything, then I need to when I hear two white people telling a black joke,

36:45.140 --> 36:50.060
I have to step up, which thank God I haven't heard that in a long time, a long time.

36:50.060 --> 36:55.260
But, you know, in my life, years and years ago, especially in the high school days, those

36:55.260 --> 36:58.020
are the types of shitty things I would hear sometimes.

36:58.020 --> 37:02.620
And so I have to be able to speak up and say, that's not funny.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.420
Like, did you have you looked at the calendar?

37:05.420 --> 37:06.420
It's 2021.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.420
Yeah, right.

37:07.660 --> 37:11.300
Why did you think that it was OK to say that joke in front of me?

37:11.300 --> 37:17.980
And if I'm not able to have that uncomfortable conversation, nothing's going to change.

37:17.980 --> 37:19.340
And that's it.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.340
And it's the same thing.

37:20.340 --> 37:24.140
It's the same thing with with LGBT, et cetera.

37:24.140 --> 37:28.420
If I'm sure there are people that have told gay jokes about me behind my back and my true

37:28.420 --> 37:31.420
friends are the ones that stick up and say, don't do that.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.420
Mm hmm.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.420
Oh, sorry.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.420
Go ahead.

37:36.420 --> 37:43.860
I'm actually I'm actually making my post about it right now so that, you know, I can hopefully

37:43.860 --> 37:44.860
get it started.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.300
I really think that we need to have more more said about it.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.300
So, yeah.

37:48.300 --> 37:52.540
As Joan Hunter Matt in chat says, did you see there was that other story about the pregnant

37:52.540 --> 37:57.260
women woman who management refused to give her time to see the doctor when she was having

37:57.260 --> 37:58.260
complications?

37:58.260 --> 38:02.940
I forgot what Activision Blizzard's response was to it, but it made my blood boil.

38:03.460 --> 38:08.980
Well, those are the types of issues where that's why the state is getting involved with

38:08.980 --> 38:14.460
a lawsuit now, because that type of stuff is straight up against the law.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.340
And that's why you're seeing that being leveraged.

38:16.340 --> 38:23.740
So so unfortunately, correct me if I'm wrong, but the Cosby suite and all that stuff.

38:23.740 --> 38:26.500
I mean, we can look at it and go, that's pretty fucked up.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.940
But there's nothing the state of California can really do about it.

38:28.940 --> 38:34.740
They're not breaking the law, per se, unless something illegal goes on in that suite.

38:34.740 --> 38:37.500
They're not breaking the law.

38:37.500 --> 38:41.060
This, as Joan Hunter Matt pointed out, that was breaking the law.

38:41.060 --> 38:43.060
That's discrimination against somebody because they're pregnant.

38:43.060 --> 38:47.020
And that is very much that's certainly against the law in California, if not at the federal

38:47.020 --> 38:50.960
level, which I'm pretty sure it is.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.540
That's basically a form of sexual harassment, long story short.

38:54.540 --> 39:00.900
So that is why Activision Blizzard is in trouble with the state of California.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.140
It's now among other things.

39:03.140 --> 39:08.540
Please don't get me wrong, but it's just these other things that are now kind of playing

39:08.540 --> 39:14.700
into it alongside of that, that's, you know, making it making it a moment of reckoning

39:14.700 --> 39:19.500
for the whole industry, for sure.

39:19.500 --> 39:23.420
Sia Tabiri in chat says a few months ago, someone I knew in high school messaged me

39:23.580 --> 39:26.980
and told me he was always amazed at how well I dealt with stuff in high school.

39:26.980 --> 39:31.100
And apparently I'd blocked out a lot or I was not aware of a lot of bullying, harassment,

39:31.100 --> 39:35.120
bad stuff that went on behind my back.

39:35.120 --> 39:39.540
I don't know if this is like too raw for me to get into on a video game podcast, but all

39:39.540 --> 39:44.660
I can say is that, like, I really feel that comment because there are definitely a lot

39:44.660 --> 39:50.840
of parts of high school, especially junior high school, that I straight up have blocked

39:50.840 --> 39:52.420
out, blacked out.

39:52.420 --> 39:58.700
Like I look back on certain memories I can and I actually think some of that plays into

39:58.700 --> 40:04.460
the memory issues I have ongoing today because I have that's how PTSD works, Rob.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.060
Well, then guess what?

40:06.060 --> 40:10.340
I mean, we're not going to diagnose those sorts of things on the show, but I can tell

40:10.340 --> 40:12.060
you this is someone who has PTSD.

40:12.060 --> 40:16.780
If you want to if you want to go that direction, then perhaps.

40:16.780 --> 40:20.780
But all I can say is that, you know, that type of stuff and the associated traumas and

40:20.780 --> 40:27.540
stuff left me to this place where now I barely I have a hard time remembering a lot of things,

40:27.540 --> 40:30.420
and I think some of that plays into it for sure, absolutely.

40:30.420 --> 40:37.820
Now, the good news is video games were oftentimes my escape from all of that, to be quite honest,

40:37.820 --> 40:44.580
because video games were an awesome story, video games where I could escape a lot of

40:44.580 --> 40:52.180
that and get into a world where, you know, I wasn't being threatened with violence and

40:52.180 --> 40:53.180
called names.

40:53.180 --> 40:59.220
But anyway, we won't get into that.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.180
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, yeah, I've blocked out a lot of high school as well.

41:02.180 --> 41:05.280
I remember the worst things, but not a lot of stuff in between.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.740
It's interesting because I always get asked, are you going to go to your high school reunion?

41:07.740 --> 41:14.380
And I'm always like, I can think of nothing in this world I want to do less.

41:14.380 --> 41:19.820
My high school, honestly, once I stopped giving a shit and punch that one girl in the

41:19.820 --> 41:22.640
nose, no one gave me a problem anymore.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.900
I've blocked out most of my home life.

41:26.900 --> 41:35.920
And it was for being a woman or, you know, a girl at the time that dared to speak up,

41:35.920 --> 41:47.120
to call her stepdad a sexist asshole, to question everything, to be weird.

41:47.120 --> 41:51.200
You know, I got it more at home than I did at school.

41:51.200 --> 41:57.760
And that is, I'm not going to go into a lot of that because it really is, a lot of it

41:57.760 --> 42:04.540
is super personal, but you need, I, we really need to make, and this is actually going back

42:04.540 --> 42:05.860
to the Activision Blizzard thing.

42:05.860 --> 42:11.940
We need to make safe spaces for people so that they can speak up and not just to speak

42:11.940 --> 42:15.140
up, but to have a fucking break.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.940
I think we need to recognize there's a lot of people who very clearly have been through

42:17.940 --> 42:21.940
some trauma in the gaming industry and they need that type of space.

42:21.940 --> 42:22.940
Absolutely.

42:22.940 --> 42:23.940
100%.

42:23.940 --> 42:24.940
Yeah.

42:24.940 --> 42:29.720
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I go back to my high school reunion to get all the apologies.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.500
You know, it's, I get, I get that comment.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.500
I do.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.420
Um, from my perspective, I'm just kind of like, I, it's, it's, it's weird.

42:38.420 --> 42:46.140
I literally do not care about a lot of those people and I'm, I mean, I just, and there

42:46.140 --> 42:48.020
are some people from high school that are very cool.

42:48.020 --> 42:49.780
I keep in touch with on Facebook and stuff like that.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.980
I don't want to make it sound like every single person in high school was Dick.

42:51.980 --> 42:54.940
No, there was a lot of them, but like, it's hard to explain.

42:54.940 --> 42:58.360
Like I, like as far as like the people who bullied me and stuff, do I, do I want to go

42:58.360 --> 43:02.220
and like a big Romy and Michelle high school reunion sort of thing and show them all up

43:02.220 --> 43:03.220
and all that?

43:03.220 --> 43:07.860
No, I, it's, it's, I, I don't, I don't know what easy way to put it.

43:07.860 --> 43:10.060
I don't care if those people are dead.

43:10.060 --> 43:12.800
I don't care if those people are millionaires.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.020
I don't exist in your universe.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.300
They don't exist to me.

43:16.300 --> 43:17.300
Exactly.

43:17.300 --> 43:22.720
I have had to block them out and cut them out like little like dolls or something.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.940
I do not care about these people.

43:24.940 --> 43:26.100
Yeah.

43:26.100 --> 43:34.420
I followed a few on Facebook, but I was like, your lives are boring.

43:34.420 --> 43:36.660
You're boring.

43:36.660 --> 43:43.620
You said you had all of this, just all of these, you know, dreams that you had and career

43:43.620 --> 43:44.820
stuff that you wanted to do.

43:44.820 --> 43:47.500
And I'm talking mostly about the girls I knew.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.500
Right.

43:48.500 --> 43:54.700
And you know, and I'm not putting this down as, as a choice, mind you, but like they got

43:54.700 --> 43:59.780
married young and had lots of kids and now they're Christian mom.

43:59.780 --> 44:03.540
And I'm like, you're fucking boring.

44:03.540 --> 44:12.700
You stopped defining your life by your terms and did it by the terms of other people.

44:12.700 --> 44:17.140
And yeah, that's where I think we're getting off topic.

44:17.140 --> 44:18.140
It's fine.

44:18.140 --> 44:19.140
It's fine.

44:19.140 --> 44:24.140
Uh, there's, there's a lot of, see, see what these stories bring out though.

44:24.580 --> 44:25.580
It is.

44:25.580 --> 44:26.580
It is a lot to unpack.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.940
And I think that's why there's a lot of people reacting to this, you know, and maybe they're

44:29.940 --> 44:33.740
not even involved with it directly, but it's kind of like, um, you were saying in our chat

44:33.740 --> 44:37.100
person was saying, I see stuff like that Cosby suite thing.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.260
And I just, I don't know what you want to call it.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.260
I disassociate.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.140
I, everybody responds different ways to it.

44:43.140 --> 44:47.180
I just, I'm, I just, I flow it out of my body.

44:47.180 --> 44:48.180
I can't see it.

44:48.180 --> 44:49.180
Yeah.

44:49.180 --> 44:50.180
It stops existing.

44:50.180 --> 44:51.180
Yep.

44:51.180 --> 44:52.180
Anyway.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.820
That's kind of what happened when my emotions shut down.

44:54.820 --> 45:00.620
I had to basically wipe it before I could think or feel again.

45:00.620 --> 45:01.620
Okay.

45:01.620 --> 45:04.440
Anyway, let's go on to happier topics.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
Video games.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.620
They're great and escapism.

45:07.620 --> 45:10.340
And because of them, we all met each other.

45:10.340 --> 45:13.660
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

45:13.660 --> 45:14.660
this week.

45:14.660 --> 45:18.040
And I I've been playing a lot, uh, but I'll start with you, Darzaga.

45:18.040 --> 45:21.820
I killed a bunch of people in Dead by Daylight.

45:22.460 --> 45:28.340
I don't know what it has been, but it's either complete fail with the shittiest of survivors,

45:28.340 --> 45:36.240
like and by shitty, I mean just like salty little tryhards or it's been really engaging

45:36.240 --> 45:41.460
matches that have been fun to play and, and that I've won.

45:41.460 --> 45:43.140
And Rob, a miracle happened.

45:43.140 --> 45:45.140
You got a four K.

45:45.140 --> 45:47.740
No, I've gotten several four Ks since my first one.

45:47.740 --> 45:48.740
I stopped counting them.

45:48.740 --> 45:51.180
I don't know what else to shock up there with Dead by Daylight.

45:51.420 --> 45:54.420
The miracle is a three K on Haddonfield.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.420
Oh, okay.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.420
Okay.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.420
With pig.

45:57.420 --> 45:58.420
All right.

45:58.420 --> 45:59.420
Had three K.

45:59.420 --> 46:00.420
Yeah.

46:00.420 --> 46:04.220
And I'll tell you the one who won was a David named bear and he wasn't shirtless.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.220
So his name didn't fit him.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.220
Anyway.

46:07.220 --> 46:10.380
Um, you have to have shirtless David.

46:10.380 --> 46:11.380
I'm sorry.

46:11.380 --> 46:12.380
That's just what you have to do.

46:12.380 --> 46:17.260
Um, I also have played Mandalorian finally.

46:17.260 --> 46:19.640
Um, it's pretty fun.

46:19.640 --> 46:25.600
It's got a shaker motor in it and ours shakes a lot, but I kind of don't hate it.

46:25.600 --> 46:29.440
Um, uh, the, the modes in it are really fun.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.040
Um, it's got great sound.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
I, I, I'm going to put this out here.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.560
I do not care for Grogu.

46:36.560 --> 46:41.960
I'm tired of seeing Grogu every fucking where, and I hate that there's a big fucking massive

46:41.960 --> 46:44.200
one in my game.

46:44.200 --> 46:48.360
They could have just like made a little one in the little pod somewhere and not have this

46:48.360 --> 46:50.640
big thing staring at me.

46:50.640 --> 46:51.640
I'm sorry.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.640
He looks like a booger.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.480
Are you going to open up the cabinet and put a little paper bag over his face?

46:55.480 --> 47:02.120
Am I on it, but he's not as, he doesn't offend me as much as the head in fun house.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.120
Okay.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.120
Oh yeah.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.120
Oh yeah.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.120
That thing is scary.

47:06.120 --> 47:07.120
Yeah.

47:07.120 --> 47:13.740
I, I, I'm, I'm perfectly fine with the skull and no fear because uh, that was a Steve Ritchie

47:13.740 --> 47:14.740
doing its voice.

47:14.740 --> 47:15.740
That was fine.

47:16.140 --> 47:23.420
I, I, but I love when I'm playing of listening to the music and Bobby makes a good point.

47:23.420 --> 47:28.540
Um, he doesn't move and I love that.

47:28.540 --> 47:29.540
So you know he's not going in there.

47:29.540 --> 47:33.900
All right, Brad, his name is not fucking baby Yoda and that pisses me off more than the

47:33.900 --> 47:37.220
character's existence.

47:37.220 --> 47:38.220
Just saying.

47:38.220 --> 47:40.460
It's not even fucking funny.

47:40.460 --> 47:41.700
So yeah, I played that.

47:41.940 --> 47:49.020
What I love is that the, the overall theme song plays and the sound effects and the videos

47:49.020 --> 47:55.420
that play, they go quite well with, um, the various modes in the game.

47:55.420 --> 48:01.180
You know, I, I absolutely, I absolutely love it.

48:01.180 --> 48:05.340
I'm glad that we traded, uh, monster bash for it.

48:05.340 --> 48:07.740
Um, I didn't care for monster bash that much.

48:07.780 --> 48:13.500
You know, the kind of, you know, B movie monster theme never really just sat with me.

48:13.500 --> 48:21.500
Um, but, uh, oh yeah, Bobby, it was probably me, uh, you know, from 3000 miles away with

48:21.500 --> 48:22.500
my mind.

48:22.500 --> 48:23.500
It's wild.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.420
The spotlight that shines on the child fell out of my cab.

48:25.420 --> 48:27.500
Now I see it was dark soccer is doing.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.780
Which also means star soccer.

48:28.780 --> 48:32.340
You can remove it without ruining the game.

48:32.340 --> 48:37.380
Um, uh, it is wild to me that you and Bobby have the same pinball machine now.

48:37.380 --> 48:38.500
It's just, I don't know why.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.020
And mine just happened.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.020
Yeah.

48:41.020 --> 48:44.100
He was talking about it on his show tonight and was showing a B roll of putting it together

48:44.100 --> 48:45.100
and all this.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.380
Well, you know, as much as you'd like put together one of those things, but kind of

48:47.380 --> 48:49.180
like showing the ins and outs of it, it was, it was neat.

48:49.180 --> 48:54.940
I certainly encourages his, uh, uh, archive broadcast to you guys to check out the machine

48:54.940 --> 48:55.940
and putting it all together.

48:55.940 --> 49:00.380
Um, yeah, I have the forest and I do, it's interesting to me that you guys have the same

49:00.380 --> 49:01.380
thing.

49:01.380 --> 49:02.380
It's just wild.

49:02.380 --> 49:07.900
Um, also I put up a Tik TOK earlier, just, you know, of after my game, just, you know,

49:07.900 --> 49:11.700
basically showing in general what it looks like in my garage.

49:11.700 --> 49:14.460
Um, and I'm going to go ahead and bring this up.

49:14.460 --> 49:19.060
So since I'm doing GISH this month, the grave international scavenger hunt, uh, actually

49:19.060 --> 49:24.540
this week, one of our challenges is to have a Mandalorian crossing guard.

49:24.540 --> 49:28.540
And I was just thinking of putting a big stop sign on top of my pinball and submitting that

49:28.540 --> 49:29.540
as a joke.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.980
There you go.

49:30.980 --> 49:40.380
I don't know if it'd count, but yeah, um, but yeah, it's, it's really, it's really fun.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.820
It was, it was worth it.

49:41.820 --> 49:46.580
I mean, we weren't going to buy it at first and since the trade happened, we're just completely

49:46.580 --> 49:47.580
down for it.

49:47.580 --> 49:50.580
And yeah, so we have a, we have the pro edition.

49:50.580 --> 49:51.580
Cool.

49:51.580 --> 49:58.100
One day, I'll have a pinball machine one day, but I'm also still playing word scapes because

49:58.100 --> 50:03.880
I'm, I'm addicted to, to words and spelling and all of that stuff.

50:03.880 --> 50:13.060
And of course, Fantasian, um, I finally got my, my guys, uh, my team, I'm playing with,

50:13.060 --> 50:14.660
with the guy team right now.

50:14.660 --> 50:23.620
So they're all leveled and, um, I beat the intermediary boss who you think is the main

50:23.620 --> 50:25.740
bad guy that isn't.

50:25.740 --> 50:30.660
I've been calling him robot Vincent because he kind of has like that style of Vincent

50:30.660 --> 50:32.180
from final fantasy seven.

50:32.180 --> 50:33.180
Okay.

50:33.180 --> 50:36.940
Um, actually I've been calling him Vomson too, cause his name is Vom.

50:36.940 --> 50:45.300
Um, but yeah, I, I've had a great time, uh, with that game and I'm getting on to a bit

50:45.300 --> 50:48.180
further on to the end of the, of the game.

50:48.180 --> 50:53.180
And so I'm again, trying to think of what I'm going to do when Fantasian is over.

50:53.820 --> 50:55.780
Um, but there's going to be a Fantasian too.

50:55.780 --> 50:59.620
So I'm looking forward to that eventually coming out on Apple arcade.

50:59.620 --> 51:00.620
Nice.

51:00.620 --> 51:01.620
Yeah.

51:01.620 --> 51:03.620
All right, Rob, I think you would enjoy it.

51:03.620 --> 51:04.620
It's really fun.

51:04.620 --> 51:06.620
I need to play it at some point.

51:06.620 --> 51:10.120
Um, it's pretty, there's a lot of games I'm juggling.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
That's all I'll get.

51:11.120 --> 51:16.240
Well, like the general fighting and navigating through the game is pretty easy, but those

51:16.240 --> 51:20.540
boss battles, they require some planning.

51:20.540 --> 51:21.540
That's all I'll say about it.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.540
Fair enough.

51:22.900 --> 51:23.900
All right.

51:23.900 --> 51:24.900
Anything else to share?

51:24.900 --> 51:25.900
Um, yeah.

51:25.900 --> 51:26.900
All right.

51:26.900 --> 51:31.780
Um, so for my gaming week, I had a lot of time to play games this week cause, um, and

51:31.780 --> 51:35.700
I think I talked about this on last week's show, but I had a surgery on Wednesday.

51:35.700 --> 51:38.700
So, um, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.

51:38.700 --> 51:44.300
And um, I guess, I guess I could, it's, it's, my neck was worked on, so I had that bump

51:44.300 --> 51:48.020
on my neck to remove and just, uh, I'm going to give a content warning.

51:48.020 --> 51:50.480
I am going to turn around and show it it's bandaged.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.980
It shouldn't look too bad, um, but just if that's a woozy thing for you, just avert your

51:53.980 --> 51:54.980
eyes for a moment.

51:54.980 --> 51:57.640
I'll tell you when I'm facing front again, but I'm going to turn around so you can see

51:57.640 --> 52:01.160
it here and, um, you can see it's, it's pretty large.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.840
Um, hold on, sorry.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.320
And I apologize to the podcast listeners cause you can't see this part, but I'm going to

52:06.320 --> 52:09.080
quickly have a moment of silence while I turn around and show you that.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.760
Um, I'll talk.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.560
So Rob has turned around.

52:13.560 --> 52:21.320
He's got a big gauze of about maybe two inches, uh, in, uh, width on the back of his neck.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.560
Maybe about one inch in height.

52:23.560 --> 52:26.120
Um, and I turned and I turned back around.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
It's safe now.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.440
I was giving the, the play by play.

52:28.440 --> 52:29.440
I know.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.440
I know.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.440
I know.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.440
Just for the folks who have read it.

52:32.440 --> 52:33.440
But honestly it's not, it's not gross.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.440
I mean, it's a bandage.

52:34.440 --> 52:35.440
Yeah.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.000
So you can't really see under the bandage right now.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.040
So I'm sure it's still Healey.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.000
There's at least 10 stitches in there.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.520
Cause I asked how many stitches did you do?

52:41.520 --> 52:45.760
And he kind of chuckled and he went at least 10, I will say this.

52:45.760 --> 52:51.840
It was not a pleasant experience, but honestly, like I, I, it was interesting as we talk about

52:51.840 --> 52:58.000
all these like traumas and things, I definitely like for like two hours after the surgery,

52:58.000 --> 53:03.040
I felt completely, I just can't believe I was awake for it because just the whole fact

53:03.040 --> 53:11.800
that I could like feel what, what was happening and like when I, yeah, I, I, in fact even

53:11.800 --> 53:14.320
trying to describe it now is, is causing me in some sort of way.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.620
So I'm like, it just, it was a lot, it was very intense.

53:17.620 --> 53:22.240
And so, um, I, I was just like in shock for like two hours after, uh, thankfully a lot

53:22.240 --> 53:23.240
of that settled down.

53:23.240 --> 53:29.960
Um, but I just like just having yourself literally opened up on the table while you're awake.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.720
Did you tell people what exactly it was that was removed?

53:32.720 --> 53:33.720
Oh yeah.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.720
I had a lipoma.

53:34.720 --> 53:35.720
Um, yeah.

53:35.720 --> 53:41.280
So if anyone watches Dr Pimple Popper, it was that I watched lots of lipomas coming

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
out of people.

53:42.280 --> 53:46.400
I, and see, I can't watch that stuff and especially not my mom's addicted to.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.920
They actually asked me after they were like, do you want to see it?

53:48.920 --> 53:51.960
And I, I, I thought for a second, I, I think that was just me.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.120
I said, no, I don't want to see it.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.040
So I'll never know what it looked like.

53:56.040 --> 53:57.560
And I'll tell you this, Rob.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
Yeah.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.480
Your eyes actually don't look that gross.

54:00.480 --> 54:05.880
Um, I looked at before I had the surgery when I was looking at the information about it.

54:05.880 --> 54:11.040
So I did see like what it is, but I, they're like chunky pudding.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.040
Yeah.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.040
I didn't want to see it after that.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.040
So anyway.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.040
Yeah.

54:15.040 --> 54:18.800
Um, but the good news is, sorry, I mean, look, here I am.

54:18.800 --> 54:19.800
I'm doing the show.

54:19.800 --> 54:20.800
I'm back to normal.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.800
I feel it back there.

54:21.800 --> 54:25.920
Um, that's why if you see me touching my neck a lot during the show, it's at that part where

54:25.920 --> 54:28.000
it's getting a little itchy in that area.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.080
So I just kind of have to like softly kind of like, I'm itching it, but I'm not really

54:31.080 --> 54:32.400
itching it type of thing.

54:32.400 --> 54:36.560
So, uh, because it's going to be, I think they said 10 days before the bandages kind

54:36.560 --> 54:39.400
of come off naturally and the dissolving stitches and all that.

54:39.400 --> 54:44.900
Um, so Rob, I'll offer you a suggestion because I've had many a surgery in places that get

54:44.900 --> 54:45.900
really itchy.

54:45.900 --> 54:46.900
Yeah.

54:46.900 --> 54:54.560
Um, I have this lotion, um, now it's not cheap, but I have the CeraVe version, but they'll

54:54.560 --> 54:57.900
often call it like Sarna or something.

54:57.900 --> 54:59.900
And it's really good for just like stopping an itch.

54:59.900 --> 55:03.860
But I also was using lidocaine spray, like the, what you spray on the sunburn.

55:03.860 --> 55:06.340
That is apparently the anesthesia they use too is lidocaine.

55:06.340 --> 55:07.340
Oh yeah.

55:07.340 --> 55:08.340
They use lidocaine.

55:08.340 --> 55:09.740
They just use a much stronger version of it.

55:09.740 --> 55:15.980
But I mean, if you like get the cheapo lidocaine, you know, uh, sun spray stuff, like just get

55:15.980 --> 55:19.860
one that's like, you know, unscented, plain lidocaine, like the thing is something like

55:19.860 --> 55:22.220
4% lidocaine in solution.

55:22.220 --> 55:26.860
But that'll help quite a bit with, with the itchiness and it won't, it won't really hurt

55:26.860 --> 55:27.860
your stitches.

55:27.860 --> 55:31.180
I actually think I have some of that aloe vera with lidocaine stuff.

55:31.180 --> 55:32.940
Um, you want just lidocaine.

55:32.940 --> 55:34.340
You don't want to put the aloe in it.

55:34.340 --> 55:35.340
Okay.

55:35.340 --> 55:36.340
I guess that's good to know.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.340
Cause I would have went to that.

55:37.340 --> 55:38.340
Trust me.

55:38.340 --> 55:41.940
I popped a stitch once.

55:41.940 --> 55:42.940
It wasn't bad.

55:42.940 --> 55:48.100
I just put like liquid bandage on it and it, cause they had used a skin glue for me, but

55:48.100 --> 55:49.100
it wasn't bad.

55:49.100 --> 55:55.940
I, I don't know what they used because I swear I felt him tying knots, but they use a dissolving

55:55.940 --> 55:59.620
stitch and usually cover it with, um, what's it called?

55:59.620 --> 56:00.620
Skin bond.

56:00.620 --> 56:02.780
I think that's basically liquid stitches.

56:02.780 --> 56:03.780
That's what's going on back here.

56:03.780 --> 56:04.780
Yeah.

56:04.780 --> 56:05.780
Yeah.

56:05.780 --> 56:08.860
So anyway, so it's just a much stronger version of the liquid bandage.

56:08.860 --> 56:09.860
Yeah.

56:09.860 --> 56:10.860
Anyway.

56:10.860 --> 56:11.860
Sorry.

56:11.860 --> 56:13.820
I don't mean to talk about the surgery all night, but, but just, it was seven centimeters

56:13.820 --> 56:17.820
big is how long the, cause the nice thing about my insurance, you can go on and look

56:17.820 --> 56:18.820
at all the posts.

56:18.820 --> 56:22.180
I can go read the post-op notes that I did do because that's just reading.

56:22.180 --> 56:23.180
There's no pictures.

56:23.180 --> 56:24.180
We're through the same place, right?

56:24.180 --> 56:25.180
Yeah.

56:25.420 --> 56:26.420
Yeah.

56:26.420 --> 56:27.420
So I love that.

56:27.420 --> 56:28.420
I absolutely love that.

56:28.420 --> 56:29.420
Isn't it fascinating?

56:29.420 --> 56:30.420
Well, yeah.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.820
And I, you know, I used to work in healthcare on the administrative side of it and I would

56:32.820 --> 56:34.940
see those types of notes all the time.

56:34.940 --> 56:37.300
So it's kind of interesting to read them now when they're about you.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.300
Yeah.

56:38.300 --> 56:41.300
So anyway, enough of that.

56:41.300 --> 56:42.300
All right.

56:42.300 --> 56:48.220
Um, but I, because of all that, I, I mean, I was still kind of working, but, um, kind

56:48.220 --> 56:49.400
of some short days.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.280
So I was playing a lot of video games, just kind of relax and recuperate.

56:52.280 --> 56:57.000
So the game that was really taken up the most of my time that I was playing was Yakuza

56:57.000 --> 57:00.200
Like a Dragon, which I've talked about previous weeks on this show.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.040
I am all the way up to goofy.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.040
What's that?

57:03.040 --> 57:04.040
That game is goofy.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
It is.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
It is.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.040
But it's so, it's so fun.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.980
Uh, I'm up to chapter 11 now in that game.

57:08.980 --> 57:11.660
So just to give you some, cause I think the last time I talked about it, I was like chapter

57:11.660 --> 57:12.660
four or five.

57:12.660 --> 57:14.360
I'm going to chapter 11 now in the game.

57:14.360 --> 57:20.460
Um, and a lot has happened and I just, I'll say I, I am, the story is so good.

57:20.460 --> 57:22.420
Like it's like, it's like I'm watching a Netflix show.

57:22.420 --> 57:23.420
It really is.

57:23.420 --> 57:28.220
Uh, all these chapters could be episodes of a Netflix show and I'm at the point now where

57:28.220 --> 57:35.760
finally little hints that are dropped in the earlier parts of the story are coming back.

57:35.760 --> 57:41.220
But I love how Yakuza remind you just enough.

57:41.220 --> 57:45.340
Like it will, it will like, like let's say they're talking about an obscure, I shouldn't

57:45.340 --> 57:49.620
say obscure, but let's say a character that was around in chapters one and two suddenly

57:49.620 --> 57:52.180
comes back in chapter 10 or 11.

57:52.180 --> 57:55.980
You will get like a little flashback where like you get a little photo on the screen

57:55.980 --> 58:00.280
that shows you that moment from chapter one or two so you can go, Oh yeah, that, you know,

58:00.280 --> 58:03.780
and for me who has a bad memory to begin with, I need a lot of that stuff and it's really

58:03.780 --> 58:08.060
good for me to be able to kind of keep along with the story and they do it just enough

58:08.060 --> 58:10.220
so they're not like hitting you over the head with it.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.900
Um, which I think is great.

58:11.900 --> 58:16.100
So yeah, the way they, the way they story tell it, um, is really good.

58:17.060 --> 58:19.940
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Hey Rob, you should play Yakuza like a dragon.

58:19.940 --> 58:23.740
I can't believe nobody out there would tell me to play this series.

58:23.740 --> 58:29.780
Why, why, why would, why would none of you out there say, play Yakuza, play literally

58:29.780 --> 58:31.980
any of those games, play them.

58:31.980 --> 58:33.460
No, nobody would do that for me.

58:33.460 --> 58:34.860
I can't believe it.

58:34.860 --> 58:39.940
Anyway, I hope you all hear my tongue in cheek cause many of you have said to play this series

58:39.940 --> 58:40.940
over the years.

58:40.940 --> 58:43.140
I finally did it and I'm loving it.

58:43.140 --> 58:47.900
My one little complaint about the game is that I'm getting to the point where battles

58:47.900 --> 58:49.900
are feeling very grindy.

58:49.900 --> 58:50.900
I get it.

58:50.900 --> 58:55.660
It's a JRPG battles are supposed to be grindy, but because the animations are so over the

58:55.660 --> 59:01.660
top, because I don't always want to let the computer control things because it's not the

59:01.660 --> 59:04.780
smartest AI they'll use up my good items.

59:04.780 --> 59:10.580
If I'm not careful, um, I have to kind of sit there and it gets, it gets a little repetitive.

59:10.660 --> 59:14.380
Um, especially because I just got to a point, I don't want to spoil anything.

59:14.380 --> 59:17.300
I'll just say the difficulty just went up like a lot.

59:17.300 --> 59:22.020
Um, and I was, I wasn't ready for it, so I'm having to go back and kind of like grind stuff

59:22.020 --> 59:25.540
and that part is not very, um, exciting.

59:25.540 --> 59:32.500
Um, but I imagine not, yeah, but the story is so good, it's compelling me enough to push

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
through.

59:33.500 --> 59:37.940
Um, but I haven't, I like a game like that, but sometimes you have to suffer for your

59:37.940 --> 59:38.940
enjoyment.

59:38.980 --> 59:43.620
And like, it's, it's also interesting because the main story is very serious and then all

59:43.620 --> 59:49.420
the sub quests are where all the sophomoric potty humor stuff shows up.

59:49.420 --> 59:53.420
Um, like the, the, the guys dressing up as babies and those sorts, that's all the side

59:53.420 --> 59:54.420
quest stuff.

59:54.420 --> 59:58.620
So it's, it's interesting how you literally have comic relief for side quests.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.660
Uh, it's just, it's interesting to me.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.660
So, um, so anyway, yes, I recommend the game.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.660
It's on game pass.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.700
That's how I finally was like, all right, shut up everybody.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.380
Cause it's not going to cost me anything outside of what I'm already paying.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.960
So that's how I finally did it.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.780
And now I'm like, all right, day one for the seat.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.460
That's how game pass getcha because now I'm like, all right, day one for the sequel.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.460
I'm getting it.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460
Absolutely.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.380
Cause the sequel is going to be, uh, going to be fire.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:29.060
I know that anyway, um, other games I've been playing this week cause it hasn't just been

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.060
about that.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.660
I've also been playing dead by daylight.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.660
Here's the weird thing.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:40.500
I played on PC and I played on Xbox because I needed to get achievements and I was like,

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.580
Oh, my rank on dead by daylight fell all the way back to 20.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:50.340
This is the best time to do adept achievements because you get match made with all the other

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.960
baby players.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:57.220
And since I'm on consoles, but I do not have to feel bad one bit if somebody's on the hook

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.260
and I just opened the door and let myself out.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260
I don't care.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.180
Like, you know what?

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.180
Sorry that happened to you.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:11.160
I was in a match though, where there was a baby nurse killer and the other three were

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:17.700
very clearly a Swift and it was me and these three kept flashlighting the hell out of this

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.700
nurse.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.100
But because they were doing that, they weren't doing any gens.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.720
So I'm running from gen to gen and doing it.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720
And you know what?

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.560
Two of them died because all they were doing was hook trading.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.460
And then one of them got hooked and I was like, you know what?

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.400
When you do clownery, the clown come back to bite.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.420
And I left like, if you didn't want that clownery, do a gen.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.060
So I played dead by daylight.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.820
And then I also played, of course, Final Fantasy 14.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.820
I've been playing a lot of that.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:46.780
And then another brand new ish game that I played this week.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:52.580
I played flight simulator, Microsoft flight simulator just came out for the Xbox.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:57.340
So the Xbox Series X version and Series S version of the game just came out.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:02.060
Although I dabbled a little bit on PC, I think I said after I played the PC, I can't

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:07.940
wait for the Xbox version because it's going to dumb it down for controllers to a level

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.620
where I'll be able to play it better.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.460
And I have mixed feedback on that.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.060
They didn't actually really dumb it down.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.700
There's still, they packed a lot of stuff into the controller.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.740
So much so that like, I kind of have a hard time without the on-screen instructions and

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.780
stuff to like, still like, you know, do a smooth takeoff and all of that.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.420
But it's very easy to have the AI takeover.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.060
And there's a very rich tutorial in the game.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.940
And there's a really cool little mode where you can just go in and there's some certain

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.900
pre-selected areas and pre-selected flights.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.940
And it's just, okay, it's going to plop you in San Francisco.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.540
The plane is already in the air and go.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540
Now you're taking over the plane.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.300
You can just explore San Francisco.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.700
And that's some of the coolest stuff that's in the game.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.700
I keep saying game.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.260
There's not really a game here.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:06.980
I mean, you can kind of make your own game such as I'm going to fly in real time from

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.760
my house to this airport that's a hundred miles away or even further.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.240
And I'm going to do a real time flight.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.780
There's not really a game.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:20.960
I mean, I guess the lessons kind of make up a game because the later lessons actually

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
have you do that.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.200
It has you do flights from start to finish.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.860
So I guess that's the game.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.640
But I think we can all kind of identify that is a little weak.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.480
However, it doesn't matter with a game like this.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.280
I really think a lot of this is just like that experience of being able to explore the

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.980
world.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.980
And it's beautiful.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.400
Like the graphics in this game are incredible.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.080
It is 4K and it looks great.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.220
The very first thing I did in this game was I flew an airplane out of SAC Executive, not

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.480
the international airport, but the executive because it's a little closer.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.860
And I flew over my house because I wanted to see it.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.920
And it was really cool, a cool thing to experience.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:13.220
And yeah, I feel like if you're the type of person that can sit on Google Earth and look

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:19.200
at places far away and go, ooh, or if you like to do like Street View or if you've ever

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.240
played Geo Guesser and you're into that, I feel like Flight Simulator is going to be

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.220
your jam because that's that's what it is.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.960
It's just putting a new spin on Google Earth, I guess, except it's Bing Earth and making

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.420
it beautiful.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.120
It's it's great.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.920
Looking in chat, as Joan Hunter-Matt says, Flight Simulator is so pretty and easier on

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920
the controller.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.160
It's still tough because you have to be very precise with your movements.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.040
Yes, you can't just pull down on the thumb stick to tilt the plane up.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040
No, no, no.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.400
You have to gently, gently push down a little bit to get the right amount of movement.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.760
So it does challenge some of the conventional video game ways of thinking, that's for sure.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.680
Bobby Black Wolf says, I stalled trying to fly over Everest.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.040
I crashed into the Yosemite because I was flying around Yosemite because one of the

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040
flights is Half Dome.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.540
You can just start right there.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.640
And it said that there were like animals on the ground.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.720
I was trying to get close to the ground because I wanted to see the animals and I crashed

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720
the plane.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.680
I'm only laughing because I think I would do that, too.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680
You know what, though?

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.760
I will say it does it in a tasteful way when you crash the plane.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.080
The music in the game is really good.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.920
The music soundtrack in the game is very, very good.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.240
I feel like I'm on Soren at the Disneyland ride.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.240
I feel like I'm on Soren when I play Flight Simulator.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:44.220
But if you crash, there's no explosion or anything graphic.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.660
It just instantly goes to black and you hear this little like, like a drum beat that goes

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.980
doo, doo, doo, doo.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.980
And it instantly goes to black and just goes, you have sustained critical damage and have

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.240
broken your plane.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:01.820
And then the music instantly goes sad because you crashed the plane.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:08.420
So it's very tastefully and artistically done, actually, I will say, because, you know, there's

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.820
people out there that are going to be like, oh, I'm going to just, you know, try to crash

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:16.120
into the airport and see what happens.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120
Nothing happened.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.120
Nothing happened.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120
It's artistic.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.120
It's artistic.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120
This will happen.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120
It's done very artfully.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120
So, yeah.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.580
As she says, I did enjoy just flying around places I've lived or been to.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.580
Yeah.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.580
I flew around my own town.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.980
I did the San Francisco thing.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.940
I flew Vegas at night.

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.060
I thought that would be a fun flight to do.

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:39.820
I flew down because I took one of the little like prop planes practically and flew down

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.680
the strip of Vegas at night.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.440
And I thought that was a lot of fun.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.520
Bobby will be proud of me.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.680
I did Atlanta.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.400
I did a flight at a Hartsfield Jackson and tried to find the Dragon Con hotels and did

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.400
that.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.920
So that was fun, too.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.160
And Bobby says, I flew to my college and landed in the state.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160
Oh, I did Disneyland.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.420
I tweeted that one.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:06.520
So I flew out of John Wayne Airport and tried to find Disneyland, which actually wasn't

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.960
as easy as it sounds because it isn't.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.560
It does label a lot of points of interest, but probably due to licensing or whatever,

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.840
they don't have Disneyland as a point of interest.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.300
You can find the town of Anaheim.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.760
But as we all know, even though Disneyland is in the town of Anaheim, there's a lot more.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.200
So I had to kind of find it.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.040
I kind of had to go, OK, there's the freeway.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.360
You just have to go down five.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.020
Yeah, but which of these freeways is five?

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.200
It takes you a minute to kind of find that, right?

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.560
And then I was like, OK, I found it.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.680
And there's a lot of trees, which because I would have thought, oh, you just look for

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.680
the Matterhorn and that's how you find Disneyland because that's what you do when you're in

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.680
the car, right?

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.760
You find the Matterhorn.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.040
But when you're up in the air that high, the Matterhorn doesn't really stick out because

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.400
you're really high up.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.400
So anyway.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.400
Yeah.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400
Yeah.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.320
S.J. 100 Matt says, I flew around New York City and that was a lot of fun, although I

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.840
noticed they didn't include the Freedom Tower.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.600
I did notice the imagery is a couple of years old.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.200
So to use a local example, sorry, but for Dark Soccer's benefit, I found you can actually

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.800
fly out of a grass field in Clarksburg.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.360
I thought that was kind of cool.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
So I did.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.160
Yeah, I did a flight from there to like downtown.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.680
But I noticed as I was flying up five, I was like, OK, there's the Sacramento Tower and

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.640
that, oh, the Delta Shores isn't there.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.940
So the whole Delta Shores isn't there.

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.120
It's just an empty.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.200
It looks like it's been like like a lot that's being prepped for something.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.720
But that's all that's there.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.720
And the early days.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.800
That's a big shopping complex here locally in the area that's been open.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.200
It's been around probably two, three years at this point, but it's not in the imagery.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.160
So it is a little bit dated.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.120
But I did find you can go into the DLC and there's all sorts of like free stuff.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.720
I guess they're user mods.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.120
And there was some U.S. update thing that was like four gigs that said it would update

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.760
like 40 airports and certain landmarks.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.240
So I downloaded that.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.660
So I wonder if there isn't like other stuff that might update the OK.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.660
Bobby Lockwood says the U.S. world update is from Microsoft.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.680
So I did grab that for what it's worth.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.040
And Bobby says the satellite imagery is old.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.780
The Georgia Dome is there and the Mercedes Benz Stadium is still dirt and Turner Field

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.560
is still the baseball stadium and Truist Park is woodland.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.080
That means nothing to me.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.060
But for those of you local in that area, it gives you an idea.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.060
But that's OK.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:35.140
I don't mind that the imagery is slightly old because it's it's enough close enough.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:43.340
So, yeah, I just again, if you are a Google Earth or geoguessr or I'm exploring a town

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.440
in street view because it's fun type of thing, like it's a very specific type of nerdom.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.340
And I am very much into that flight simulator is absolutely for you.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.780
But I do think there's some people that are going to go, wow, I just downloaded 100 gig

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780
game.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.720
That's not even a game.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.320
I hate to say flight simulator is probably not for you, but I think it's still worth

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320
checking out.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.440
Just just if you want an impressive piece of graphical thing for your Xbox Series X,

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440
do it.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440
No.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
All right.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440
All right.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440
Well, I can't do it.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.800
Well, no, not not yet.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800
Some days.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:23.120
Well, yeah, you don't even really have because you're doing everything on Mac.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.360
But I'm almost positive this will be on Microsoft Cloud.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:34.840
So in the future, you could maybe maybe Stadia might do something that be nice.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.020
It's a Microsoft first party title.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.020
So they'll probably.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.020
I'm not going to.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.020
Yeah, I get anything.

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.020
And you too.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.020
I get it.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.020
All right.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.240
OK, so that's it for my gaming week.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.960
Oh, I guess I should get in just a couple of quick housekeeping things and then we'll

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960
get into the news that's going on tonight.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.820
So just a couple of quick things.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:57.000
So the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is coming up and it's the weekend of August 20th.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.240
If I remember correctly, that is in the Atlanta metro area.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.520
Vogue Network is sponsoring that.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.800
And Bobby Black Wolf will be there.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.720
I will not be, unfortunately.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.960
So if you're in the area and you feel OK to do that because I realize this is a weird

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.000
year and all that stuff.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.080
So everybody has to make their own choice of that.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.640
So we're going to do we're going to do a low pressure ad this time.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.180
I'm just going to let you know it's a thing that's happening.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.240
If you'd like to go, great.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.720
And you can check out their website for all the updated health policies and things of

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.800
that nature so you can see if it's something you would be interested in.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.200
Another convention also in the Atlanta area that we will be at, I will be at as well as

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.280
Bobby Black Wolf is Dragon Con.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.960
Dragon Con is coming up over Labor Day weekend.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.080
And the policies for that did come out today.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.480
And so I am very relieved to see that they will be mandating masks for everybody, regardless

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.680
of vaccination status.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.520
And they did cap the attendance at half, basically, of what they had in prior years.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.240
So I'm so glad I didn't bother.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.260
I understand, you know, everybody's got to make their own call.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.680
But for me, I'm ready.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.040
So and I'm going to be doing six panels throughout the weekend.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.880
So it's going to be a different year, but that's part of the uniqueness of it, I think.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.400
So, yeah, I haven't traveled in a long time.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.080
So it'll be it'll be nice to do that.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.520
So that'll be over Labor Day weekend.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.960
So if you happen to be going, please say hi.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.760
If you need six feet of space, I completely understand.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.880
All right.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880
That's it.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.740
I guess we can get into some gaming news now.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.740
So let's do it.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.740
All right.

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.740
All right.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.280
I'm going to start off tonight and I will talk about the PlayStation 5 system software

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280
update.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.140
So there is a new beta version of PlayStation 5 system software.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.640
And the big thing about this software updated is actually expanding SSD support.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.720
So if you're in the PlayStation 5 beta program, so they actually have like a beta interface

01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:02.520
program, this new software beta 2.0-04 is .0000, that is rolling out to folks.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.720
And this is where you're going to be able to use your own M.2 SSD into the PlayStation

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.600
5 expansion slot.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.880
And you can use it for additional storage, which, you know, a lot of people have been

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.480
complaining about PlayStation 5 and Xbox, quite frankly, is that there's not enough

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.640
storage for all these games now that there are 100 gigs like Flight Simulator, right?

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.580
We need more storage.

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:30.040
So excuse me, this PlayStation update is going to address that a little bit.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.320
However, there are some specifics to this.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.600
You can't just use any drive.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.720
I would direct you to PlayStation's website to read a little more on this because I can

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.620
say it, but I don't, you know, for example, you have to use a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDS with a

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.240
capacity of 250 gigabyte minimum and four terabyte maximum.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.960
Okay, maybe you caught all that, but I bet you didn't.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:59.160
So you want to probably go look up the specs before you buy a drive to use with this.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.440
And of course, you want to make, don't, don't, don't plug one of these in with the power

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440
on.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.740
Turn, turn the power off, then do it.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.840
Some other updates, 3D audio through the TV speakers.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.200
And then there's also some in the home screen for games.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:20.400
If you have different platform versions of the same game installed, they appear separately

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.180
on your home screen.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.240
So different versions of a game are easier to spot.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.200
An icon will show you if it's PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.160
That should help with some of the issues where people were saying, I was launching the wrong

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160
version of the game.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.880
I was trying to play No Man's Sky and it kept launching the PS4 version of the game, which

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.400
is great if I want to do VR, but otherwise I don't need it.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.580
So they're separating that out a little bit.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.060
And there's some other features as well, you know, some trophy things and so forth.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.920
So check that out.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.720
If you're in the beta program, if you're not in the beta program, then good news.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.020
Other people are testing that for you and you will get that update very soon.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.180
It sounds like, I would guess probably in a month or so.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.100
So check that out when it comes out.

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:08.820
Sadly, I don't have a PlayStation 5 just yet, but that might be something that I get in

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.820
a few more months.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:14.140
I was thinking maybe this holiday, but it might, thanks to this upcoming story Dark

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:19.700
Sakura is about to bring us, now I'm like, maybe I could just wait till spring next year.

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.700
We'll see.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.180
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:29.520
So a lot of people have been looking forward to Horizon Forbidden West as supposed to be

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.900
coming out on PS5.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:35.860
Well, they're going to have to keep looking forward to it because it has been delayed

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.220
until first quarter 2022.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:46.560
Before it was actually set to be a holiday release, I said that it's just part of a number

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:52.400
of delays that have been completely across the industry, including a few other games

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.380
like God of War.

01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:02.900
They're saying that it's due to COVID-19 causing production challenges, having developers work

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:12.940
from home, but also that it's just been bumping the games for just completely other reasons

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.940
as well.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.260
So they're still working on it.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.600
They're just behind.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:24.440
I feel like we need a little card that we flip to here on the show, the little B roll

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.420
or whatever with a picture of Miyamoto that says that little quote, the bad game is bad

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.340
forever and nobody will forget that you delayed a good game.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:39.700
I feel like this needs to be on standby because, you know, apply it in this particular case.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:45.100
But I mean, also at the same time, like I get it, not only has the COVID pandemic made

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:49.580
making games that were a very collaborative thing before a little bit harder, but I think

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.260
probably what's also coming into play here is that most folks reasonably thought once

01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:03.100
vaccines were available, the pandemic would start to subside.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.700
Now I'm just going to leave it at that.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.980
You all can fill in the blank.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.580
We all know, but that is not what happened.

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.160
And we all know why that didn't happen.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.780
And we're just going to leave it at that for now.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.940
And my point is that I bet a lot of these project plans that kind of thought about how

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:26.860
are we going to get the game done by Christmas or, you know, the holiday and all this stuff?

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.580
How are we going to get the game done by then?

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.580
Probably involved.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:35.460
Well, the good news is we'll be back in the office in June and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.460
Yeah.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.460
Cue the clown.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.940
Cue the clown car music.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:42.620
We thought we thought.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620
You know what?

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.620
Hmm.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:45.620
They might.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:50.920
We were supposed to go back to our offices next month and they've delayed us to an unspecified

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.260
time.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.720
So we, I'm not surprised.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.360
We were going to have the office open optionally on Monday.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.440
Some people are like, like male staff and stuff like that.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.400
Some people have to be there and have been here that there that whole time.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.280
But it's a very minimal staff that's very spread out massed as you can imagine.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.240
They were going to open it up to others who wanted to go in.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.440
Like I, I, I, that's what we're like.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440
Yeah.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440
They were going to do that on Monday.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.880
They've actually said no, we're not even going to give that option.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.920
They've now scaled it back to, you can make an appointment to go get your shit that you

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.160
haven't been able to get since March of 2020.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.480
And that's about all we're going to do right now.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:40.040
And with no specification of when it'll be even just be open to like, I want to, I just

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.560
want to not be at home for a day.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.920
Like I want to go into the, of which there's a lot of people in that category right now,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.400
but not going to happen tomorrow.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400
So yeah.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:59.400
Um, honestly, I think everyone was thinking way too, uh, too, what's the word I'm thinking

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.080
of optimistically?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.760
I think, I think with these, um, Delta variant stuff, yeah, it's going to get, it's going

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:13.200
to get, uh, for the people who didn't get vaccinated, uh, or can I feel, I feel bad

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.320
for the people that can't, because there are a very small set of very small set of people

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.880
that due to other ongoing treatments or certain immunocompositions comp, compromises, can't

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.760
get immunized.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.200
And I feel really bad for those people.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200
Really bad.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200
Yeah.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.600
So, um, anyway, Pele Hanumea in chat says, uh, don't wait a hundred hours in the PS Valhalla

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:41.480
PS five Valhalla, still OMG on how beautiful in 4k on my QLED and really fast load times.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.800
So for what it's worth, I do have Xbox series X.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.240
So most of those cross-platform things, um, I I'm, I'm just playing on series X.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.200
Um, however, I do realize Sony has their own games.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.120
I need to play at some point, including the one dark soccer just mentioned this story

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.640
says, okay, you have a little bit longer and absolutely by the time final fantasy 16 is

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.880
out, you know, I'm going to have, I will, I will not miss final fantasy 16 period.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:14.560
I I'm at the point where, you know, thanks to the pandemic and us not taking vacations,

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:20.200
I will probably take two or three days of vacation when final fantasy 16 comes out because

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200
I'm an adult.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.760
I'm an adult.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200
Exactly.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800
All right.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.920
Pod culture and chat says Delta is rough, but what the fuck is Epsilon going to be like?

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.600
They're already up to iota iota iota is where they're up to.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.240
Actually, um, some of the variants of concerns have different concerns other than

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.240
they're more transmissible.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.720
So we haven't heard about them as much because they're more isolated to certain parts of

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.720
the globe.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.080
But the good news is vaccines have proven some sort of effectiveness, certainly keeping

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.880
you out of the hospital on all of them, unless you're like over the age of 80, uh, or have

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.240
other, you know, like I said, the immunocompromised and those issues going on, uh, that, that,

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:11.440
uh, it is even then it's a very, very, very, very, very small amount and the media does

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.880
kind of fixate too much on that small amount, um, that are vaccinated and still have those

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.360
types of problems because the vast majority of vaccinated people not having problems.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
Yeah.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360
Yeah.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:30.640
Even so though, and it's officially out that you can be vaccinated and you can still get

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640
it.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640
Yep.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:40.880
So I'm just like, uh, yeah, um, no, I'm going to remain a hermit.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880
Let's see.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.080
Uh, looking at the other chat, uh, pod culture and chat says, I hear a kitty.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080
Is it Smush or Midna?

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080
It's Smush.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080
Sorry.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.080
I don't know what he's on about.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:54.840
Midna's voice is quite a bit different too, so, um, daddy took, other daddy took a Costco

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840
trip today.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.840
So Smush is probably seeing something that came back from Costco and it's probably going

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.840
crazy about it.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.400
So there is that, um, all right, well, let's move on.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.280
Uh, I brought up Final Fantasy.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.280
So let's talk about Final Fantasy 14.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280
This is interesting.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:17.240
I, I, I, I learned some things this week because of this story, y'all know, I love Final Fantasy

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240
14.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.240
I play too much of it and I'm really, I'm really excited for the next expansion.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.780
Endwalker is going to be coming out and Endwalker is going to be bringing two new jobs to it.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:33.240
The Sage class and the Reaper class and Final Fantasy 14 kind of has these iconic job, literally

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.040
iconic job icons that go with the different classes in the game.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.800
In fact, some people, some people go so far as to get these tattooed on themselves.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.520
Um, but a lot of people have them like with bumper stickers on their car or patches on

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.280
their backpack and that sort of thing.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.920
These icons that represent the job classes that they play.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:56.520
Well, if you started to make some of the, that gear for, um, Endwalker, you're going

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.720
to have to change it a little bit because it turns out they have changed the Sage icon,

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.220
uh, for Final Fantasy 14.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:07.300
But it's very interesting the why behind this.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:12.640
They actually went so far, Naoki Yoshida, uh, being they in this case, actually wrote

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.780
a, uh, another letter, uh, which he's been doing a lot lately, um, addressing like, you

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.340
know, cause I just talked about this last week, the increased player base in the game.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.220
He kind of wrote a letter about that and the challenges they were having.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:30.060
Um, he wrote another letter, uh, about the slight change in the icon for the Sage class.

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:36.060
Um, so they have changed it a little bit so that now some of the, so the Sage uses this

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:40.980
weapon that's kind of like, um, like these little darts that fly through the air sort

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980
of thing.

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.620
And the way it was represented were these four little darts, excuse me, with little

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.700
holes in the top of them.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:56.100
But the way they were put together was actually making some folks a little bit anxious because

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.280
of tripe, trypophobia.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:05.500
I think it's called where trypophobia is basically if you see clusters of holes.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.700
So things like, and again, I apologize if I'm talking about things that are going to

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.740
give you the heebie jeebies, but please understand I'm trying to be educational.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:17.100
Like I got this week, things like honeycombs, right?

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:24.100
That can give people the heebie jeebies because they it's, it's that the holes together.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.700
And I actually never even really knew that this was a thing.

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:31.900
So but, but because I also tweeted about it and I actually got a response where somebody,

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.700
I think a couple of them actually, where somebody was like, yeah, this is me.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.420
And you know, I'm glad, I'm glad he did this.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:44.140
So and they, he changed, they changed, oh he, the team changed the icon.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.260
So now they're not all like lined up.

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:50.100
They're kind of like tilted in a little bit and the holes in three of them are filled

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.100
in.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.100
So they just, they look a little, it looks a little different now.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.500
I think it's a very subtle change, but you know, there were the trolls that came out

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.180
and said, the old one looked better.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:07.820
You know, the old, I already had stuff made up for the old one, whatever, get over it.

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.140
You could live in your special little snowflake cloud and all that stuff.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.140
Congratulations.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.460
You know, no one cares.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.460
It's that Jurassic Park meme where, look, look at this guy.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.460
Look, nobody cares.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.620
But you know, the old no one cur.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.620
Yeah.

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.780
But you know, she, and again, distress.

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:26.540
I'm saying that to the people that are like the old one was better.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:30.260
I'm not saying that to the people that had, which I never realized was the thing.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:32.900
And now I learned, I was like, oh, okay, well that's neat.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:39.380
You know, Final Fantasy XIV has really made a name for itself in how accessible it is.

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.960
It's won awards for its accessibility.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.860
And when you see Yoshi P write a letter like this, explaining what they, basically saying

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.660
this aversion, in the letter, this aversion is known as trypophobia and those who have

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:55.740
it feel disgust and fear when they see clusters of small holes or bumps.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:04.180
Like having a producer of a game explain that it's like, okay, you get what, to tie

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:07.900
this to the Activision Blizzard thing a little bit, I'm sorry, but I have to, and I'm not

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.340
pitting XIV against wow.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:12.140
That's not what I'm doing.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:16.780
However, what did I say with that whole thing and other things like it?

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:22.840
The culture is defined by the management, right?

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.840
And you hear about what's going on that we all talked about at the beginning of the show

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.540
and gross, disgusting, et cetera, and all this.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.280
But then you look at Naoki Yoshida and you got to say, now here's a man who deserves

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.680
a gold star.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.880
Here's a man who doesn't just get one piece of glitter.

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.040
Here's a man who gets the whole star because he acknowledges it.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.160
He explains it.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.860
And he says, you know what, we need to, sorry.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860
You know what?

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860
It was brought to my attention.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.760
I think we can change this without like changing the meaning behind it, all this stuff and,

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.880
and make, you know, make this a little better for some people.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.600
And he walks that fucking walk.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.840
And you know what?

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.000
His game is reaping the benefits now.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.680
And I say, well deserved.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.520
And I don't just say that as a fanboy of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:14.200
I say that as a Naoki Yoshida is a great person.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.200
Let's see.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.240
Dejirama S in chat says certain forms of trypophobia get me, so I'm lucky.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.720
I just didn't know this was a thing.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.160
That Tigerclaw points out even strawberries can cause it.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160
Yeah.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160
I saw that in some of the articles.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160
Yup.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160
Yup.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160
Yup.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.160
Fifth Dream says Yoshi P is just a wholesome dude.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
Pod culture brings that.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160
And you know what?

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160
Somebody in Discord had said this too.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.420
I don't know if it's Tigerclaw or what, but was talking about the Xbox Series X.

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:40.900
And if you look at the top of a Series X, it has all those holes in it.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.080
It's for ventilation.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.480
I get the logic behind it, but some sites were running an article about how the Xbox

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:53.640
Series X was causing some people issues because of its design.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.400
And it's the same thing that's playing into that, which is very interesting.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.180
Very, very, very, very interesting.

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.180
So yeah.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.340
And SG100 Matt says it's great when devs listen to their communities and are transparent

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.340
about it.

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.340
Yeah.

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:10.980
So, you know, and he's not, it's not like he's changing the entire game.

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:16.080
He's just, he's changing a thing where he's like, this is an easy fix to like not give

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.000
certain people anxiety and we can still have the same artistic vision.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.200
I'm just going to change it.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.200
Cool.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.000
That's like, that's a great attitude.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.360
We need more of that anyway.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.840
So anyway, a big gold star, a golden hug for you, Yoshida.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:35.840
You're a good person.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.840
All right.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840
For sure.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.400
That's another reason why I will, I will, I will plunk down that money day one for Final

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.800
Fantasy 16 with him on the team.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.920
How can it be bad?

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.440
Famous last words, but you know what, even, even if it's a bad game, I'll still, which

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.440
I doubt it will be, but even if it's a, even if it's on the lower end of Final Fantasy

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.000
games or whatever, I will still say, you know what?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.560
I supported a great team.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.800
All right.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800
Indeed.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800
Let's move on.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800
Dark Sakura.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.720
So how about boring financial stuff?

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720
My favorite.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.720
Right.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.160
But this is actually very notable.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:28.040
Basically the video game industry has taken a really big amount of business in the terms

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.560
of mergers and acquisitions.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.840
Basically record investment ratings in the second quarter.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:41.680
So this is going on the, well, the numbers, just to put it this way.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:50.840
There is a $18.2 billion in mergers and acquisitions and 7.4 billion in investments.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:59.280
So because the market has been so strong in the wake of the pandemic that, you know, and

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.000
we're seeing the results, we're seeing these companies do buyouts, we're seeing, you know,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
like one of them, there was an iron source and plays studios.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:20.560
There was a EA purchasing a glue mobile, gearbox being acquired, you know, and just so many

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560
things going on.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:30.800
We're hearing more and more like the biggest one was Epic games doing a $1 billion late

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800
stage.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:38.680
I mean, of course this is, Epic has also been in other issues going on that could affect

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:44.160
them financially that I'm not supposed to talk about.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:49.280
But I mean, we're seeing more and more of this happening.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:57.420
And now what I wonder is that how the recent executive order is going to affect further

01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.800
mergers and acquisitions.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.700
I mean, I'm glad to see the investment happen.

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:08.840
I'm glad to see, you know, I'm glad to see the industry grow, but I don't want it to

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.240
grow at the expense of a fair competition, right?

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.920
You know, if we're gonna have to live in a capitalist society, you may as well cut out

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920
the monopoly.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920
Absolutely.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920
Makes sense.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.920
Yeah.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.200
And you know, what's interesting is that we see a lot of like up and coming, you know,

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.160
It's interesting because I feel like every time there's a merger, there's people that

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.800
inevitably leave the company because of the merger and then start up their own studio.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:41.400
And then it's a weird game that's played in the gaming industry is in like these new studios

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:46.720
start to come up and some of them end up getting bought, but not all of them do, you know?

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:51.520
And I think about a lot of developers, you know, again, thinking of the big story this

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.680
week about how probably there were a lot of people that left those companies because of

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.680
those cultures.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.520
And I'm not just picking on the one we were talking about earlier, but a lot of the AAA

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.100
companies and started their own studios and why we have like some really cool companies

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:11.480
out there that, you know, like I think of like super giant games and a game like Hades

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.760
and just like everything that kind of came out of that game and everything is like, I

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.520
don't know if that studio in particular was started by like disgruntled former employees

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.520
to it.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:25.600
But it's nice to hear about like these smaller studios kind of coming up and doing taking

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.040
a different approach to games that oftentimes pays off very, very well.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.040
Yeah.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:35.160
But you know that the cycle is going to continue, you know, eventually they're going to be popular.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:41.040
They're going to get bought, you know, it's a big cycle that needs to be be broken.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:47.300
And I'm really curious to see what happens with the with this executive order.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:52.280
I want to see that when everything is going into place, I want to see what these results

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.280
are.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:33:02.320
I really think that we're going to start having a bigger sort of thinking of not necessarily

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:09.520
that they're all affected as much, but I want to see there be maybe a little bit more equilibrium

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.520
in the industry.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.520
I gotcha.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.520
I gotcha.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.800
So even though you say, hey, woo, video game investment, I think this is something where

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.880
it's like, oh, this this this trickles down to the types of games that end up getting

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.200
made.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.200
So right.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.200
Big news.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:30.200
Not necessarily trickle down financially because no, not that, but, you know, screw

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.200
you, Reagan.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.200
All right.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200
Moving on.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.880
Let's let's talk about kitties.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.720
Let's talk about a game about kitties.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.720
Yay.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.540
Kitties are the best.

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:41.540
Maybe that's why Mr. Smoosh came.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:42.540
Oh, he left.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.540
I just looked over to where he was sitting.

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:44.540
He left.

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:45.540
Never mind.

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:46.880
He didn't come in for the cat story.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.780
But one game that I don't know about you, but it definitely caught my attention when

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.160
it was shown at one of these advertised a while back.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.760
It was it was at the early PlayStation five showcase.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.160
I want to say it was actually their announcement showcase.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.320
They showed this game called Stray, which was all we really knew at the time is it's

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.840
a game about cats.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.740
And that's kind of all we still know.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.920
It's a cat simulator.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.920
It's called Stray.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:15.520
But we know when it's coming out, it is coming out in early 2022 and it's going to be coming

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.960
out for the PC and it's going to be coming out for the PlayStation.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.720
And if you want to see more about the game, a gameplay walkthrough just came out this

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.720
week.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:29.080
So that is actually something you can look at to get a little more sense about what the

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.720
game really is and so forth.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.720
So sorry, I brought it up.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.080
I want to see a little bit of it on this computer over here.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:41.460
But you do play as a cat who ends up getting injured and separated from his family.

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:47.280
So you use your physical abilities to navigate the environment and solve puzzles partway

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.400
through the adventure.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:54.200
You meet a drone and then they that drone will let you converse with other robots in

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.080
the city and interact with objects in the environment.

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.520
So that's kind of interesting.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.520
You can.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.240
You can also do fun cat things, scratch furniture, which we all knock shit off.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.240
It has to.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.080
You can interact with vending machines.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.440
You can rub up against the legs of robots that you meet.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.520
Nothing yet about knocking shit over.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.720
But how can how can that not be involved?

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.440
Yeah, there's got to be asshole cat mode.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.440
There's got to be.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.200
Well, don't forget, there's that game on itch.io that was actually it's not called Asshole

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200
Cat, is it?

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.920
But basically, that's what you are a cat and you play an asshole cat.

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.080
There was cat lateral damage.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.080
That's it.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.080
Cat lateral damage.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.080
That's it.

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.080
Yeah.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.080
Like it's not called Asshole Cat.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.080
You know what I'm mixing it up with?

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.600
I'm mixing it up with Untitled Goose Game, because the reason that is called Untitled

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.600
Goose Game is because that game was called Asshole Goose or something like that in the

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.600
beginning.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600
Yeah.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600
And they obviously cannot release a game on intended.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.920
Like, you can't release a game called Pixel Shits.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.800
So it's called Pixel Poops will get asshole goose became Untitled Goose Game.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:04.320
So anyway, the goose is a big dick.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.520
The fifth dream came up with that.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.760
We have cat lateral damage for knocking shit over.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760
Yes.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.440
And Matt says there is some platforming stuff where you have to knock things over.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440
Good.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.440
Good.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.160
Pod Culture brings up President Stray, the game.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.360
You know what?

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.720
This is as good as this is as good as it's going to get for President Cat.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.720
I'll take it.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.720
You know what?

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:25.720
President Cat.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.000
That news is so 2008, I'll say it.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.080
At least we're now in the year in the year 2021, we're finally getting a fucking cat

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.080
game.

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.080
I'm excited.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.080
All right.

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.080
Good lord.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400
I'm excited about Stray.

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.400
All right.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.400
Yeah.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.080
Let's get let's let's get into a time where not all games are about cats with our next

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.080
segment.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.560
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.560
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:11.040
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.760
And what did you pick for us this week, Arsaka?

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:20.200
I picked an arcade game called Lucky and Wild.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.520
I have talked about.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.920
We always talk about this game.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.360
How has this not been a classic game?

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.360
All right.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:29.920
I went to look and I was like, you know, we brought this game up before, but have we actually

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920
done it?

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920
And yeah.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.240
So it's time.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.120
It is time.

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:43.600
So Lucky and Wild is a first person racing slash shooter game that was released by Namco

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.640
in 1993, ran on the Namco System 2 hardware.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:57.200
And it's a throwback to you remember the movie Tango and Cash?

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.200
I do.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.200
Just to give you a heads up, I'm going AFK a quick second bio break.

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.200
OK.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.920
So it has quite a, you know, it also pulls a little bit from Starsky and Hutch as well.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:18.360
So the the way the first person, the first player is called Lucky, who's this debonair

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:25.860
guy in a business suit who was named after who was modeled after Starsky and Tango.

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:31.480
And he asked to drive the car, accelerate, you know, basically do all that and shoot

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.880
with a light gun.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.480
The second character is called Wild, who is kind of like a surfer guy with the long hair.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.920
And he's modeled after Hutch and Cash.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.000
And he shoots with just a second light gun.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.720
So he doesn't have he doesn't have to drive.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.960
I mean, lazy, lazy butthole.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:56.960
Anyway, you have to help the two of them catch six suspects by the names of Jerky, Gambit,

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.440
Juliora, Heel, Bear and Big Cigar himself.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.400
So you go through the stages.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.540
You have to fire at enemy cars, destroy their henchmen as well as the cars, stop the projectiles

01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.880
that are fired at you, the usual for a shooting game.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:20.200
When you catch up to the suspect, you have to continuously fire until its energy is depleted

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.440
and then you will capture the suspect and get a reward.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:30.960
If the the timer runs out, the suspect will escape and you'll see the text got away appearing

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:32.740
on the screen.

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:39.940
So after each stage, Lucky and Wild drive to the pink cat's garage to get their car

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:47.600
repaired and they'll be entertained by young women wearing cattails and ears.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.840
Yeah.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.480
So yeah, sexism in the industry.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:59.040
Anyway, so there are a few different ways that you can play the game.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:02.260
So one player can drive and another one can shoot.

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:12.320
One player can drive with someone else on the gun and someone else on the other gun.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:15.560
One player can drive with another one manning both guns.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.880
One player driving.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:20.840
You've got all kinds of like different ways that you can do this or you can have somebody

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:25.800
doing both of the guns while driving.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:32.440
Although Namco has never actually put out, though, an official that lets the three people

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.480
play simultaneously, but people would do it and I've seen it happen.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:45.760
So it was created by Konoe Itaka, who joined Namco in 1991.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.920
His first project was Tank Force, which was a sequel to Tank Battalion.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.320
He also worked on the original Point Blank and Time Crisis.

01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:01.520
So when he noticed that the arcades had a lot of young couples playing, he wanted to

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.200
make a machine that young couples could play.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.740
He also noticed that buddy cop movies in Japan were becoming more popular, like movies like

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.240
Chips and Police Story.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.680
And so he made the game.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.360
I mean, the title in Japan is called Joe and Paunch, as it was inspired by chips.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.520
That always makes me think of Space Ghost Coast to Coast with Moltar.

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.320
Cool chips.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.280
That was always funny.

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:40.520
Anyway, he also got some ideas from Sega's Railchase, which was, you know, had the motion

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.120
based seat that reacted to your actions in the game, like shaking over the rocky roads

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.780
and stuff like that.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:52.020
And so Lucky and Wild originally had that kind of shape in there, but Namco really wanted

01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:57.200
to have the light guns with the single shot and the trigger and everything.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:04.780
So eventually there became like this big consensus reached in.

01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.460
This is what came out.

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:14.340
It was released in Japan in April 1993 and in May in North America.

01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:24.140
So there it was it borrowed from other other things.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:29.980
So it had like the American Tuning Car Company brand was in the Ridge Racer games, although

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:33.380
it belonged to the muscle cars.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:39.740
The Lucky and Wild protagonists appeared in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX with one person driving

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.460
in the second being the gunner.

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.460
Really?

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.460
Yeah.

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.580
Wow.

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:45.580
I didn't know that.

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.820
How did I miss that?

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:53.660
And in the interactive video series Bear Stearns Bravo, the Bear Stearns CEO Jackie Dalton

01:42:53.660 --> 01:43:00.860
refers to the regulators Franco and Henry by the name of Lucky and Wild.

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:06.140
So Game Machine states that this was the third most popular arcade game in May of 1993 in

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.420
Japan.

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.540
Replay states that it was the fourth most popular deluxe arcade game at the time and

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:17.420
Play Meter listed it as the twenty fifth most popular arcade game at the time.

01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:27.540
So it goes along from a different, you know, different places that they'll argue against

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.540
it.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:33.540
But at any rate, Lucky and Wild, Lucky and Wild.

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.540
That's it.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.540
That's the tweet.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.180
I just love that, like, especially as far as Namco is concerned, like there must have

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:44.180
been some type of meeting where it's like, OK, do we make another racing game or do we

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.860
make another time crisis shooting game?

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.860
And it's all hell.

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:51.100
We're going to make both.

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.660
Why not both at the same time?

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.580
And here we have Lucky and Wild.

01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:07.500
I'm trying to actually think of how to say that in Japanese and let me see, but I still

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.620
see these cabinets around today once in a while.

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.680
It's a fun game.

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.680
It's silly.

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.680
In a good way.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.140
All right.

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:25.040
So I would I think it's no real whole day when I oh, was that the translation for why

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.040
not?

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:27.040
Why not?

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.040
Yeah.

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.040
Yeah.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040
Yeah.

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.040
Perfect.

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040
All right.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.040
There it is.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.040
Your classic game of the week.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.040
Lucky and Wild for the record.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.480
Namco just did predate time crisis.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.440
Oh, oh, well, still.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.440
OK, fine.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.440
Then point blank.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.440
All right.

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:48.120
Which actually might have predated that to know I have to double check time crisis now.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:49.120
Yeah.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.120
All right.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120
Anyhow.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.360
Well, don't don't get too far into the double checking because we're going to move on.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.360
Yeah.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.360
Time crisis was nineteen ninety five.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.360
All right.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.360
My bad.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.360
My bad.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.360
But Namco had other shooters that existed prior to that.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360
I know point blank for sure.

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.960
But anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other stories going

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.320
on in the industry.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320
So I will start.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.720
I have a story about the Tokyo Olympics.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.360
And last week we were kind of talking about a lot of those video game songs that were

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.900
used in the opening ceremony.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.760
And there was a lot of question about, well, what about Nintendo?

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.800
Where was Nintendo?

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:24.360
Because the warp pipe showed up in the handoff at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.320
You know, where was the Nintendo presence at the Tokyo Olympics?

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.040
And some folks were theorizing, you know, they probably pulled out because there's a

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.720
lot of people in Japan that kind of think the Olympics is bullshit right now.

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720
Yeah.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.640
So they probably pulled out.

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.440
And as it turns out, yeah, that's pretty much what happened.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.440
But this is as report.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.800
So, you know, we don't have it from Nintendo themselves.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.560
But this was reported by a Japanese publication, Bunshun.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.440
And I don't know, like, are we talking about a National Enquirer?

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.440
I'm sorry, Bunshun.

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.680
I don't know if we're talking about like a National Enquirer type of publication or we're

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.080
talking about something a little more respectable.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.960
But there were they are reporting there were last minute changes.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.560
Apparently the event was going to have the Legend of Zelda theme, the Mario suite, Kirby

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:09.560
Superstar Medley.

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:11.280
Oh, sorry, Mike Deft.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.760
The Pokemon opening.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:17.120
And also, apparently, Lady Gaga was going to do a gag.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.120
Now, she wasn't going to be there.

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:25.800
But Lady Gaga was going to like go down into a pipe, a warp pipe in like recorded footage.

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:29.720
And Japanese comedian Naomi Wanton be was going to come out.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.760
Watanabe.

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:35.840
Sorry, Watanabe was going to come out of the pipe as like probably like a Gaga impersonator

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.600
or something like that.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:43.280
But sadly, the ideas were thrown away because of the controversial statements by the company.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:46.920
You know, they had all the questions, the issues with all those shitty things that were

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.960
said beforehand.

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.600
That's why Nintendo pulled out, basically.

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:55.040
So I do have to explain a little bit of something about Shukan Bunshun.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.080
OK.

01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:07.520
Is that this magazine has been credited with bringing down a minister and a politician.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.960
And it nearly broke up one of Japan's biggest boy bands.

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:19.800
So basically, the magazine does exposes and investigative reporting and typically has

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.200
a lot of clashes with Japanese government.

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.200
Interesting.

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.200
OK.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.280
This isn't a tabloid.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.440
This is like an expose magazine.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.440
Interesting.

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.440
OK.

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440
All right.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440
Good to know.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.440
Yeah.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.800
So it's it's it's a little more Teen Vogue and a little less National Enquire basically

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.800
or TMZ.

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.800
Perez.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.800
Yeah.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.800
Yeah.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.800
OK.

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.800
All right.

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.800
In other rap.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:48.800
Maybe a little more Al Jazeera.

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.800
Fine.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:50.800
All right.

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.480
Hey, there's a lot of great stuff that Teen Vogue's done in the past few years.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480
All right.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.480
Oh no.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480
Teen Vogue is amazing.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.760
Anyway, what else is amazing?

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.440
The Simpsons arcade game is a great game from years ago.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.200
In fact, oh my God, is that it's 30 years old.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.020
It sure is as a 30 year old game.

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.560
And we had all those rumors going into E3.

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.560
In fact, they weren't just rumors.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.480
We had a fucking trailer that leaked and still yet no announcement at E3 about the Simpsons

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.480
arcade one up machine.

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.120
Well, guess what?

01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.200
We will never know what caused the delay.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.480
Nobody's saying anything.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:29.400
All we know is that arcade one up officially announced the Simpsons arcade retro cabinet

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.620
and it's going to have authentic artwork and relatively easy assembly.

01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:37.000
You can start preordering the machine on August 16th.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.040
We don't know how much the machine is going to cost, but just so you know, Turtles in

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:46.140
Time is six hundred and fifty dollars and that is a pretty similar sort of thing.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.540
And there's only going to be one game with this, with the Simpsons, because a lot of

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.100
those cabinets have multiple games in them.

01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:53.100
Not this one.

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:57.780
So, but I will say if there's any cabinet that people remember from their childhood

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.340
that they might, it might be this one.

01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:04.980
Anyway, I am crossing my fingers and toes that this means that Tron cabinet isn't far

01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:05.980
behind.

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:06.980
But you know what?

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:08.380
I'm not going to hold my breath either.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:12.740
Oh, Orange Wright says, I heard this also has Simpsons bowling.

01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:14.380
It has a track ball.

01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:15.380
Interesting.

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:18.260
But yeah, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what happened to the bowling game.

01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:20.940
I didn't see the trackball on the new picture.

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:21.940
Hmm.

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:26.060
I wonder if something is there about why it got delayed.

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.060
I don't know.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.060
I don't know.

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.060
Just maybe it's an add on you have to pay for.

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:32.260
Well, but then you have to pay for that trackball too, which would be weird to install.

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.260
That's what I'm talking about.

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:36.260
You have to pay for like a trackball edition or something.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.260
Yeah.

01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:38.260
Yeah.

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.720
So Bobby Blackwell is saying the rumor is the Simpsons bowling is the license that got

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.900
revoked and that was an eleventh hour revoked.

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:47.300
So that might, we might be starting to put together why did this suddenly not get announced

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.300
at E3?

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.300
Aha.

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.300
But we don't have it.

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.840
We don't have a definitive answer on that.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.300
We just, we just sort of are reading tea leaves there.

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:58.540
Anyhow moving on Dark Sakura.

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:01.220
So finally updates for Animal Crossing.

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.860
So maybe I'll check on my village.

01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:08.420
The updates, well, it says the update is supposed to happen July 29th.

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.700
So I missed that.

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.540
And that there were going to be more updates later in 2021.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.300
So hopefully they'll be good.

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.540
I mean, it's the fireworks and the seasonal items.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:22.500
So I don't know if it's going to be worth me playing again.

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:30.540
And then Hot Wheels Unleashed is going to have some pop culture cars in it.

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:37.500
So among those is going to be the Turtles party wagon from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:42.900
Apparently Snoopy, I guess on the, on the doghouse, you know, the Red Baron.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:43.900
Yeah.

01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.900
Yeah.

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:45.900
Yeah.

01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:46.900
The Red Baron.

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:47.900
Yeah.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:48.900
A kit from Knight Rider.

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:49.900
The DeLorean from Back to the Future.

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:50.900
The Batmobile.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:54.700
I don't know which Batmobile, but there is something in there that honestly is more exciting

01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:56.700
than all of that to me, Rob.

01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:57.700
Hmm.

01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:58.700
A Fiat 500.

01:50:58.700 --> 01:50:59.700
Well, there you go.

01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:01.580
Cause I drive one.

01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:08.000
Every time I see a Hot Wheel Fiat, I buy it for myself the same way.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.100
Every time I see any kind of Mustang, I buy it for Danny.

01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.540
He's got so many Hot Wheel Mustangs.

01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:14.540
It's not even funny.

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.540
Nice.

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.540
Yeah.

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:17.540
All right.

01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:21.580
Now, if we could only get like the Hot Wheels pinball would be set.

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:24.980
Sia Tabiri bringing us what else is with that Animal Crossing update.

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:30.140
You can now get Boba tea and cotton candy in the drawings during fireworks events in

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:31.700
Animal Crossing New Horizons.

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:32.700
Well, that's cute.

01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:33.700
Well, crap.

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:34.700
I better play.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.700
All right.

01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:40.700
Hey, there's, there's something to do instead of Fantation one night or whatever you were

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:41.700
thinking.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:42.700
Animal Crossing journey.

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.700
All right.

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:44.700
Hmm.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:45.700
Anyway.

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:46.700
That one's even harder to get my stuff set up for.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:47.700
All right.

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:48.700
All right.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.380
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.100
out soon near you.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.140
Um, I, uh, Loki's not here tonight.

01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.680
I will try to do the U S dates here.

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:02.960
So I'm on August 2nd age of empires three definitive edition is coming out for windows.

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:06.260
I kind of think that's probably the temple release this week because I don't see a lot

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:10.940
of big, big stuff this week, although for windows and stadia, we do have grime is coming

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.940
out on the second.

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:17.360
Uh, we also have in sound mind coming out for windows, switch, PS five, Xbox series

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:18.360
X.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.560
That is a horror game, uh, from, we create stuff.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:25.280
Uh, and then we have the falconeer warrior edition on switch PlayStation four and PlayStation

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.280
five.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.500
That is a, um, air combat type of game.

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.000
So, uh, that, that's it for releases in the U S this week.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.240
Um, let me, let me get in my plane and fly over to Japan real quick and get some of the

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.520
releases over there.

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:41.640
Um, on August 5th on the Nintendo switch, we have the legend of heroes trails of cold

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.020
steel too.

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:46.080
We also have that falconeer game is out on the switch this week.

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.280
Um, and that's it on the switch.

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.940
Let me check the PlayStation four and the PlayStation five PlayStation five is getting

01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.960
the falconeer as well.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:55.960
So that is out.

01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.540
There's also a special guilty gears.

01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:02.060
There's not a guilty your game, but like a fighting stick coming out if peripherals are

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.060
of interest to you.

01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:06.780
Uh, and then the falconeer, that appears to be the big release in Japan because that is

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.660
also on the PlayStation four this week.

01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:13.300
But you can also get dirt five, uh, in Japan getting its release, uh, for Japanese audiences

01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.260
on the PlayStation four this week.

01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.480
How about the UK dark Sakura?

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:22.300
Just a handful on, um, uh, third August we have spirit fair.

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:27.740
On the sixth that we have blue fire and Zenjin, I reckon that's how it's said.

01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:30.260
And on the seventh we have seven days to die.

01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.260
How appropriate.

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.260
All right.

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.260
That's it.

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:34.260
All right.

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.180
Kind of a slower week, but understandable.

01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:40.000
We'll probably get a little more as we get into labor day and all that.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.520
So let's get back into just a few stories here, uh, and then we'll get to a listener

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.520
round table.

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:48.740
I know I saw at least one email before the show tonight and then, um, we'll see, we'll

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.740
see if there's any calls.

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:50.740
Why not?

01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.660
Um, or any questions you guys might have in chat.

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.240
And then of course, uh, I might pull a few stories from our discord, although I kind

01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.240
of pulled some to fill out tonight's show role, but, uh, I do encourage you guys to

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:04.080
join our discord and, uh, continue the conversation throughout the week, especially now that they

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.640
have threads.

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:09.000
Like w you know, what's funny is that when we first made the switch to discord, I kind

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
of joked with Bobby.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.840
I said, discord kind of replaced our forums on VOG network.

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.120
Cause you know, that got overrun with spammers.

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:17.840
We haven't used those forums in a long time.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.540
They, they honestly just shouldn't even really be there except for the fact that, um, we

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:25.280
dark, we post our story stuff.

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:26.280
That's it.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:27.280
OLR has a secret forum.

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.280
We're still using it.

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.620
Um, but yeah, and I think some of that actually powers, I just email you.

01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.620
I know.

01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.620
I know.

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.620
Um, yeah.

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:36.620
Yeah.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.620
Yeah.

01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:38.620
Yeah.

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.160
Although it probably would be better if you could get back on the forums.

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.020
It's all in one place, but it's all right.

01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:45.420
Honestly, we should just kind of all move it, but we can talk about that later.

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:48.380
Cause I kind of think we should just have a special discord channel.

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:49.940
Let's move to slack.

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.380
Well, why not discord?

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:52.420
We already have one set up.

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:53.420
It's the same thing.

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.420
I guess.

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.420
All right.

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.460
Um, any Hey, uh, DJ Rama S says one note.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.860
It's what we have at anime jam session.

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:00.860
Actually.

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.860
I love one note at work.

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.860
I never thought about using it for my personal stuff, but I use it at work all the time.

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:05.860
I'm on a Mac.

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.860
Mac has Microsoft stuff.

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:08.860
Yeah.

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:11.020
I don't want to have to pay for one note.

01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:12.020
All right.

01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.660
If it, if it's going to make me pay for it.

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:14.660
All right.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:21.020
Uh, let's talk about, uh, this story and, uh, it is, this was getting a lot of traction

01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:27.500
on social media this week and it has to do with, uh, a new series reported for Netflix,

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:32.340
a live action Pokemon series for Netflix.

01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:37.440
This is not necessarily from the minds behind detective Pikachu, cause that's where a lot

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.220
of people's heads win at first, which I thought detective Pikachu was cute.

01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:45.180
Like, and I was like, if there's a live action thing behind that, I kind of would be into

01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:46.180
it.

01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.180
I think.

01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:48.500
However, this is coming from Lucifer's.

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.700
So the people behind Lucifer, Joe Henderson, we don't know a lot else.

01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:55.260
Uh, this is a report that came from variety.

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:59.780
Variety is a, I guess the expose, but of Hollywood.

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:04.060
So they run a lot like variety and deadline are kind of the big names in Hollywood, uh,

01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.340
that talk about what's going on in the industry.

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:10.760
There variety is reporting that the live action Pokemon series is in the works at Netflix

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.400
with Joe Henderson from Lucifer on deck as writer and executive producer.

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.400
That's it.

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.400
It's in its early days.

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.820
We don't know the plot.

01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:21.040
Is it the, is it detective Pikachu?

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.680
Is it the anime series?

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.920
Is it a new story?

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:24.920
I don't know.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.040
It's in its early stages.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:27.040
Nobody knows.

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:30.720
A lot of people are jumping to conclusions, but we don't know.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:37.720
Um, however, variety is saying that the Netflix show, according to sources, would be a live

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:43.800
action series akin to the detective Pikachu film with Ryan Reynolds and justice Smith.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.560
But I don't see when I hear that, I don't hear it's in the same universe or it's the

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.560
same thing.

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.820
I hear this is not an anime.

01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:56.120
This is not a cartoon because Netflix has been doing a lot of animes and cartoons.

01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:59.980
So I think some people could have inferred that, Oh, they're just, you know, gonna make

01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:02.620
their own movie or their own series or whatever.

01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.680
And that's not actually what's happening here.

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:06.640
So all right.

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:14.100
Um, anyhow, um, we don't know a lot else, so we have not heard a single person cast.

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:16.160
We haven't seen a single frame of footage.

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:20.560
I kind of think I'm, you know what, why not?

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.680
Like how bad could it be?

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.800
Famous last words.

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.320
I'm willing to give it a try.

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.640
At least let's see a trailer.

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.560
I again, I liked detective Pikachu.

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:33.840
I think a lot of that rest on Ryan and Ryan Ryan Reynolds, but I like, I haven't seen

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.680
it and I want to, you should, I liked the way conceptually they put Pokemon in the real

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:41.940
world as if it was just a thing that was always around.

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.600
I thought it was really cute.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.600
So we'll see.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:50.320
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says the live action Pokemon series is a gateway to the smash brothers

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.320
movie universe.

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.160
Hey, Hey, I'll take it.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.120
Um, SSJ 100.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:00.520
Matt says with the success of detective Pikachu, I'm sure they fast tracked anything Pokemon

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.520
related.

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.520
Well, sure.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:05.720
Things like Pokemon go, which I didn't get into that at the top of the show.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.400
We're going to need some extra cause we need some extra stories.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.440
We're going to have some extra stories in a little bit.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:15.440
Um, we did have a hint of it and then a fifth dream in chat says it's a whole show with

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440
only Bidoof.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.440
Oh, my dream.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.440
My dream.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.440
The Bidoof show.

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.440
I will.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:24.760
It's a, it's actually just a chat talk show with Bidoof, but, but, but, but you also need

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:31.240
like the, uh, like, you know how like at the end of He-Man they would have like the lesson.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.280
You need that presented by a medkip.

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:34.280
I love it.

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.280
All right.

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.320
Uh, so anyway, uh, we'll, we'll hear more about that probably in a year.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.920
If that, when somebody gets cast for this, I think once you start to hear what the cast

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.480
is, then you might know like what the story is.

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.200
So like if they cast an Ash Ketchum, then we know they're probably going around the

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:54.560
anime, but if they don't, then they're probably doing their own thing.

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.100
So we'll see.

01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:02.220
If they do a Satoshi, then they're saying, we're going to do this the right way there,

01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:08.680
but I have the, I have a feeling this is going to be very, uh, North America based, but maybe

01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:09.680
I'm wrong.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.680
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:11.980
That could be interesting too.

01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.240
We'll see.

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.240
We don't know.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.240
All right.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.580
Um, how about, how about we do our extra stories now we're going to, we're going to break the

01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:23.040
rules a little bit and insert two stories that are not in the sidebar.

01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.740
So Dark Soccer, you just texted me something you wanted to talk about.

01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.740
So why don't you go for it?

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.940
Cause I think it's funny.

01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:28.940
I did.

01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:33.260
I was poking at my Twitter for just a second and I saw that Ariana Grande was trending

01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:36.300
and I'm like, what the hell is she done now?

01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:45.620
Um, and it looks like that she is partnered with a Fortnite for a rift tour concert series.

01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:51.980
Um, the series is scheduled for August six through eight with five show times over three

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:53.180
days.

01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:58.820
So it's a musical experience they say with a special playlist and a playable character

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.060
that was inspired by Ariana.

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:05.500
Um, the character actually looks really cute and you're like wearing like this sort of

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:09.260
sparkly metallic holographic ish kind of thing.

02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:13.340
And of course with her signature, like purple topknot, it is very purple.

02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:20.660
Um, I'll just go ahead and read what exactly, um, this says, uh, Fortnite user, uh, apparently

02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:25.620
they can schedule their showtime in Fortnite and then coordinate with their friends.

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:33.020
You go to rift tour.com for it and then, uh, she will be added to the games icon series

02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:37.900
and then you get the items, uh, that are available from the item shop from her, including the

02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:44.300
outfit and this like yellow piggy backpack called piggy smalls back bling and it's inspired

02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:48.620
by her, her real life piglet pet for the record.

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:51.780
Don't forget a piglet as a pet, they will get big.

02:00:51.780 --> 02:01:03.140
Um, and so, uh, this is a supposed to blow away Travis Scott's, uh, thing where they,

02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:08.380
uh, basically broke the record for biggest live audience in Fortnite.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:14.500
Um, so I don't know, it looks interesting that the trailer looks interesting.

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:19.780
Um, it's not enough to ever make me desire to want to play Fortnite, like in the least.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.220
Not my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.

02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:25.820
I said my gay ass is going to be playing Fortnite.

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:33.940
All right, well you do you, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing, but I'll be there.

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.940
Nothing but the best for our queen.

02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:38.140
All right.

02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:43.940
You know, she has one song that I like only because it kind of grew on me because they'd

02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:46.700
play it at Badlands every fucking time I was there.

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.760
I like, okay, Into You is like a quintessential like gay song.

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.760
That's a gay anthem.

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:52.880
I love that song.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:58.500
It was, uh, um, No Tears Left to Cry, but I also really liked the video for it.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.420
I liked the cinematography in the video.

02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:01.420
Yes, that was good too.

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:05.220
I really liked Thank U, Next that spoofed all the nineties films.

02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:06.900
I thought it was so cute.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:10.740
The video for that was great and I actually liked the message of the song, but I don't

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:11.740
like the song.

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.740
Fair.

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.620
And then there was a song in DDR that just recently got pulled because the license expired.

02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:20.420
It was, um, it wasn't Into You, but it was something else from that album.

02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:21.420
Help Me, Bamani fans.

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:22.540
What was the song of hers?

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.900
It was the sci-fi video where she was shooting the aliens and stuff.

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.820
I can't remember the name of the song, her brother's in it too, but, but, uh, I can't

02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.540
remember the name of the song.

02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.540
Bad Gay.

02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:34.540
Help.

02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:35.540
That's okay.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.820
I don't know what song is at all.

02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:44.140
Are there, are there any, see it to be somebody in chat who knows their music help.

02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:45.140
They break free.

02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:46.140
That's it.

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:47.140
That's it.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:48.140
How can I forget that song?

02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:49.140
It's such a good song too.

02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:52.140
This is the part where I break free.

02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:53.140
All right.

02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.500
Anyway, that's, that's, that's it.

02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.500
I'm never doing that again.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.940
If you could see, if you see me looking at my, my cam right now, I'm looking at you,

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:01.940
Rob.

02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:04.260
I see you through the internet and I'm judging you.

02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:05.260
Stop it.

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.260
All right.

02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.260
I feel awkward.

02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:09.660
All right.

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:10.940
Now my story.

02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:12.620
So let's talk about this.

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:17.720
So a lot of people dunking on Niantic today on Twitter, uh, because of Pokemon Go, which

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:19.720
is still going.

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:24.420
But as it is August 1st, you may or may not recall Niantic said they were going to be

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:29.240
reverting some changes that they had made due to COVID and all this, they were going

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.100
to be reverting some of that on August 1st.

02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:36.060
And a lot of people are pissed off that they made good on that promise today.

02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:42.300
And the big one is you can no longer spin pokey stops or gyms that are 80 meters away.

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:48.060
The radius is back down to what it used to be 40, which is very similar to what, um,

02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:51.900
uh, the, the, uh, range is always been an ingress.

02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:52.900
Sure.

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:56.940
Lower it when we have new variants, you know, out and people are stupid.

02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.940
Exactly.

02:03:57.940 --> 02:03:59.500
You saw the Lollapalooza thing, right?

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.500
Exactly.

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:01.500
Well, I'm sorry.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:02.500
Massive spreader event.

02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:06.140
Vaccinations were required to get into Lollapalooza too, though.

02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:11.540
Um, people, but anyway, um, the, uh, Oh, what was I gonna say with all that?

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:15.740
The, um, interface game?

02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:16.740
Yes.

02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:17.740
Radius?

02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:18.740
Yes.

02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:19.740
The, the, Oh yeah.

02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:23.620
So, um, a lot of that was in response to COVID and all that.

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.620
Um, but I, here's the problem.

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.820
Here's the problem.

02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:31.020
I think that change was never really about COVID.

02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:32.420
It really wasn't.

02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:37.740
Um, I think they made certain concessions so that people would keep playing the game

02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:41.860
and so that they wouldn't complete, like obviously the remote rating was put in and all of that

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:42.860
stuff.

02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:47.980
But, um, 40 meters is still a pretty, I just, I'm going to preface this, I'm not defending

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:55.380
what Niantic did, but I think the error is not, it's, it's, it's how they did it.

02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.720
So they doubled the distance.

02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:58.540
They said, because of COVID we're doing this.

02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:03.160
And then they said, this is a change that's probably, that's going to be permanent, basically.

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.480
They went back on that.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:07.140
That's the first mistake they made.

02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:12.620
The second mistake they made was when they went back on it, they put, they, they used

02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:15.420
COVID as an excuse.

02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:18.780
That I think is the biggest problem they made.

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:23.700
They're they didn't, they never scaled it up, in my opinion, due to COVID to begin with.

02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:29.380
And for them to now say, well, because COVID is, you know, uh, you know, we, we, we have

02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:35.280
a different standards now, rules now, whatever, uh, we're going to take this part away.

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:41.040
And I think they're using COVID as a crutch and an excuse for something that was generating

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.040
revenue.

02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:44.620
And that was people buying Pokeballs and things like that.

02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:50.620
So, uh, that's the tacky part to me is that they never should have scapegoated it as a

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:52.260
COVID thing to begin with.

02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:55.300
And they certainly shouldn't be doing that now.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:57.660
And it's pissing off a lot of fans.

02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:58.660
It's just rude.

02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:01.380
I just don't, I don't think fans are going to stop playing the game.

02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:02.540
I really don't.

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:07.540
Um, I even saw the guy from Serebii and I'm not, you know, I'm just saying big names in

02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:14.180
the Pokemon industry are, you know, in fandom are going out and saying this is fucked up.

02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:18.180
So hopefully Niantic, it kind of pressures them into changing it back or what have you.

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:23.540
But it's only gonna happen if people stop spending money.

02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.540
That's the only way.

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:29.820
I was considering playing it again and now I'm absolutely not going to.

02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.260
So we'll, I mean, it's Sunday, so we'll see what happens come tomorrow after all this

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.980
negative press today.

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:40.520
But I also wrote a tweet that I'm surprised more people didn't see because I want to point

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.900
out something else.

02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:54.060
I got an email today at 1 30 in the afternoon from Ingress, one of Niantic's other games.

02:06:54.060 --> 02:07:00.660
And it says, August virtual first Saturday, August first Saturday at home, Saturday, August

02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.700
7th, 2021 join our first Saturday, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:09.820
Isn't that interesting that another Niantic game completely recognizes that things are

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:15.820
still virtual and things are still done this, you know, in a different way because COVID

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.820
is not a hundred percent gone.

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.820
Hmm.

02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:22.860
Yeah, it's not going to be gone at all.

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:28.640
Yet Pokemon Go goes and says, oh, we're going to scale these things back or whatever.

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.420
You know that that's the problem.

02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:36.620
Pokemon Go using COVID as a scapegoat to do this now is incorrect.

02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:41.460
Mike Deft in chat says, pissing off is pretty tame.

02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.280
Mike Deft says the whole player base is all sorts of mad.

02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:47.260
Even influencers who work with Niantic are getting ignored.

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:48.260
Hmm.

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:52.620
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, there is apparently something that data miners found saying there

02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:57.220
will be a way to power up Pokestops, which people are theorizing that means when you

02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:00.620
power up a stop, you get more items and wider range.

02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:01.620
Wow.

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.380
Sounds like a moneymaker to me.

02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:07.340
Sounds like when they increased this range and said, it'll be permanent.

02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:11.360
Somebody said, why didn't we charge for that?

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:20.140
It just comes off as really tacky on the heels of that report from days ago that talked about

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:25.140
how Niantic made a ton of money off Pokemon Go Fest.

02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.140
Yike.

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.140
Hmm.

02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:32.400
DJ Rama S says, maybe Pokemon Go is on a different team from Ingress and both teams aren't talking

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:34.360
to each other about COVID issues and support.

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.920
Oh, probably, but it's still not a good look.

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.320
Remember, remember we got one of those.

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.600
I need a card for this too.

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.860
Remember, it's not about the news.

02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.320
It's not about the truth behind.

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.360
It's about what is perceived by the folks.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.600
Or to quote Eddie Izzard, it's like 75% of it is how you sound.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.760
10% of it is what you say and 5% is what you mean, I think.

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:01.760
Yes.

02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:03.120
Exactly.

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.760
All right, let's move on back to the stories.

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:10.480
We had show rolled, but I both those things were big things we needed to get out.

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:12.200
I think they're even bigger in the last minute stories.

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:13.200
So.

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:14.200
All right.

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:15.200
I have no tears left to cry.

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:16.200
Thank you.

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.200
Why don't we break?

02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.200
We vibing.

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:21.760
Let's break free from this segment and go to our next story.

02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:31.920
So there is now I'm going into some kind of like obscure kind of local news for where

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.000
is this Wilmington?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.080
I don't know what Wilmington it is, but it's a Wilmington.

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.240
But I wanted to bring it up because I think it's a really cool thing and I think we need

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.160
more of this happening.

02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:48.720
So there is a video game lounge in Wilmington called Retroscape.

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.480
I'll have to look up more about that.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:58.560
But basically what they are doing is that they have a video game summer day camp for

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.160
kids throughout all of July.

02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.840
And their goal is to get these kids acquainted with the classics.

02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:11.880
So sort of like video game history lab.

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:20.520
So they go in and they give them a presentation about the decade, you know, of gaming.

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:25.680
And so they did the 70s, 80s, 90s, and then they did the aughts and then go over the console

02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:30.960
wars and then what was popular and then they do trivia and then they have the kids play

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.320
those games.

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:35.720
So it's pretty cool.

02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:42.480
It's a way of bringing the younger generation in touch with the origins of what they enjoy

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.160
today.

02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:48.240
Yeah.

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.920
And I still don't know what Wilmington this is.

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.400
Delaware?

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:58.320
Uh, uh, North Carolina.

02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.880
Oh, okay.

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:00.880
Okay.

02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:01.880
Yeah.

02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:04.440
So there you go.

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:05.440
That's pretty cool.

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:06.440
Yeah.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:09.440
I think more people would have been excited to go to summer camp if video games were involved.

02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:10.440
Same.

02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:13.320
I only had Bible camp.

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.320
Yeah.

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.320
Me too.

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.320
When I was younger.

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:17.320
Yeah.

02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.320
Yeah.

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.320
Not quite the same.

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:20.640
Well, they would do, I think I want to say maybe we did play video games when they would

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.760
do like their lock-in stuff or whatever.

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.120
I want to say, because not us.

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:26.120
Yeah.

02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:27.120
Which is interesting.

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:28.400
It was singing Jesus songs.

02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:33.400
I want to say Atari 2600 games then were not very controversial.

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.680
All that stuff didn't come up till years later.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680
This was Alabama though.

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:39.040
We didn't have any of that.

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.040
They wouldn't pay for it.

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:45.680
They thought it was all the devil and we would make dioramas out of toilet paper rolls and

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.200
boxes and cotton, um, cotton balls.

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.200
Yay for cotton.

02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.200
Jesus.

02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:56.400
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says it's Wilmington, North Carolina and actually links to retro

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.400
Wilmington.com.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.400
Cool.

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.660
But DJ Rama S brings up, I had computer camp.

02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:03.360
It was kind of a, I do remember computer camp being a thing.

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:04.880
When I was younger.

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:05.880
We didn't have that either.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.600
Yeah, I wasn't, I never really, maybe I did go, I did like a summer school thing that

02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:10.600
involved computer.

02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:13.880
That was probably the closest I got to it, but all right.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:14.880
Anyway.

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:15.880
All right.

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:16.880
One more story before the round table.

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:19.360
And it is about, uh, I was a kid.

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:24.840
We had to go into the swamp and catch some mud, mud bugs and wrestle a gator.

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.280
We liked it.

02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:29.000
This last story is about Dr. Mario.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.400
Also a classic from the NES days.

02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:36.200
And maybe you were playing the, uh, more modern Dr. Mario world game.

02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:38.200
Uh, I played it for a hot minute.

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:39.200
Yeah.

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.200
Well guess what?

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.200
You're not gonna be playing it anymore.

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:46.920
Uh, at least as of October 31st, because Dr. Mario world's game servers will be going down.

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.720
Womp, womp.

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:54.480
Oh, so that is a, it, uh, apparently they're going to keep parts of the game on a site

02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.000
called Dr. Mario world memories.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.120
What the fuck consolation is that?

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.440
I just want Dr. Mario.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.760
I mean, screw all that.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:09.080
Uh, anyway, uh, it just goes to show a lot of Nintendo's mobile stuff has not been doing

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.280
as well as they thought because that game was only two years old.

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.280
Um, so it isn't exactly an old game at this point.

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.640
So, uh, Oh wow.

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:19.160
Did your own mess as I play it for 10 minutes a day, give or take.

02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:20.480
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.200
I'm sure there's clones of plenty out there though.

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.840
So I guess you'll have to find a decent one of those or something or, uh, have the switch

02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:29.840
version.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.840
I don't know.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:31.840
All right.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.360
Anyway, let's get into the listener round table.

02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:40.800
We're going to get your chats, your comments in chat, uh, and, uh, the mailbag at participate

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.520
at orange launch radio.com.

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:45.720
If you want to call into the show, we can probably take one or two of those as well.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.480
Just head over to our green room in discord, vog network.com slash discord.

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:55.880
Um, excuse me, but for now, let's go to the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.400
dark soccer.

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:02.900
We have one and it's long, but it's um, Hey, Hey, OLR right around the last team sale.

02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:05.940
My husband decided to buy an Oculus quest too.

02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:09.860
When I heard that he got it, I immediately went on steam and bought Moss beat saber, super

02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:14.600
hot VR and Skyrim VR of those beat saber is the only one I'm interested in.

02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:17.080
I love watching people play beat saber.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.820
Now let me first give you some background.

02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:19.820
Like Bobby black Wolf.

02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:21.200
I have a lazy eye.

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:25.880
I had surgery to correct it when I was very young, so you don't see my left eye go out.

02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:30.040
However, the surgery caused me to slightly see double for most of my life.

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:33.400
My glasses actually have prisons in there to help correct my vision growing up.

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:38.320
I never had any issues with seeing 3d or so I thought it wasn't until about four years

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.000
ago after I did vision therapy, I found out that I was missing a huge part of what 3d

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
is.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.040
Before the therapy, I always thought that 3d was just things coming at you.

02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.320
I never knew you could also see objects going in like a hallway or a room.

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.760
So this therapy opened up a whole new world for me.

02:14:54.760 --> 02:15:01.440
Anyway, I played VR games at magfest, but those games weren't that visually intensive.

02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:04.640
There is something about the Ikyulys quest two that makes it feel different.

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.480
Maybe it's the no wires thing, the better resolution, or maybe I wasn't playing the

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:10.800
right game when I was at magfest.

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:14.080
I was so intimidated when I first put on the quest two headset.

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.800
I mean, before you even get into a game, you're on this white room that seems to go on forever.

02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.120
After having the vision therapy, seeing something like this is very intense for me.

02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:28.880
It still is for me at times, I have to take a deep breath to calm down and that is when

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:31.160
I'm not even in a game yet.

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:33.920
So getting to the games, I have only played a couple so far.

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:37.860
Moss is so fascinating to me, especially when I can see down the hallways and objects moving

02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:39.420
in the background.

02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:43.260
When the mouse quill looks up at you, it's just the cutest thing.

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:47.600
Before I even start a page, I find myself just looking around for a couple of minutes

02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:49.280
just to take all of it in.

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.000
I cannot wait for the sequel.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.120
I also have been playing a lot of Beat Saber.

02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:57.160
I love how I can be very active and have a lot of fun at the same time.

02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.340
I really haven't gotten into superhot VR or Skyrim VR yet.

02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:04.240
You're probably thinking I probably should have emailed this to Bobby since he covers

02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.080
a lot of VR stuff.

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:11.720
Let me get to one of the reasons why I decided to email this to OLR.

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:16.600
Just the other day, my husband just bought a game called Synth Riders on the iCula store.

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:19.840
This is a rhythm game very similar to Beat Saber.

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.160
If you've never heard of this game, I really think all of you would love it.

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.340
So slashing with sabers, you punch these colored spheres.

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:33.060
There are also these holds that are very similar to the hold lines in DDR.

02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:38.580
When you hold down with one foot while you use your other foot to hit the arrows.

02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:41.720
In Synth Riders, you hold your arm.

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:42.720
I lost my place.

02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:46.260
You hold up your arm and follow this curvy line with one hand and you use your other

02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:49.600
hand to follow another line or hit the spheres.

02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:54.520
You do this while you are listening to a mostly 80s-style synthwave music in a Tron-looking

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:55.520
world.

02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:59.800
At one point, I thought I was in a slow-space mountain ride.

02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.620
This game is wild.

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:03.680
You thought that Beat Saber was a workout.

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:06.080
Synth Riders is on a whole other level.

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:07.740
My body hurts after I am done.

02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:11.480
The music is so good that it makes me literally dance.

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:15.300
The best part of this game is that custom songs are standard.

02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:16.840
You don't have to mod the game at all.

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.760
You just drop in some files in your headset and the song appears in the song list.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.660
I highly recommend this game if you love rhythm games and want to become more physically active.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:30.420
Synth Riders is also available on Steam and is coming to PSVR August 10th.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:33.680
Since you have had less emails lately, I am hoping to write it more.

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:39.600
I am planning on my next email to be about an old PC game that was based on a popular

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.800
candy.

02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:43.920
I don't believe this game was ever talked about on OLR.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:44.920
Please look forward to it.

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:45.760
Thanks, Ziba.

02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:48.600
I love it.

02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:49.600
Thanks for the email, Ziba.

02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:50.720
And thanks for the game recommendation.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.860
I thought I might have played this game once, but no, I'm confusing it with something else.

02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:56.360
So I'm going to have to look into this.

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.460
I'm not going to do VR, so have fun.

02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:02.680
I haven't played VR in a while.

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:04.680
The bummer is I don't have PC VR.

02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.680
I have PlayStation.

02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:11.220
So if it's not on PlayStation, I probably won't get around to it unless I do get to

02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:15.140
spend a day with Bobby Black Wolf outside of Dragon Con when I go on my trip.

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:19.580
So maybe he'll fire up the PC at Black Wolf Manor and I can check this game out.

02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:22.580
So I'll have to file that away in my brain to do that.

02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:23.580
Check that out.

02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:26.900
So because, you know, I'm going to want to play that Mandalorian pinball table, but I

02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:30.440
could come over to Jamie's house and play it there, get it out of my system.

02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:34.500
So we'll play it, play over here and then play Bobby's because we have two different

02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:35.500
versions.

02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:36.500
Ooh.

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.500
And that would be fun to say I've played both.

02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:43.960
Well, I mean, I played multiple of I mean, well, and I think next year they're going

02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.760
to go back to doing Golden State pinball expo.

02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.760
Oh, uh huh.

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.760
I hope so.

02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:52.760
But yeah, you're welcome to come over.

02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:54.080
We need to we need to hang.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.080
Yeah, it'll be fun.

02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:56.080
It'll be good.

02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:57.080
All right.

02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:58.080
Thank you for the email, Ziba.

02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.080
Appreciate it.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:03.620
I was glad to hear about the experience, too, as even though you kind of joke that maybe

02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:06.920
you should have sent it to Bobby because your experience was similar to him.

02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.740
We welcome those emails as well, of course.

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:13.580
And yeah, I was definitely I'm always interested to hear.

02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:16.900
These gaming stories from other people's perspectives, because it's like the trypophobia

02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:17.940
stuff we talked about this week.

02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.740
I would have never known, you know, unless something kind of came up about it and somebody

02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:22.740
brought it to my attention.

02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:23.740
You know what I mean?

02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:25.180
So I think it's neat.

02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:26.180
All right.

02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:27.820
We're going to take a call.

02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:30.900
And so I have to do a little magic behind the scenes to make this work.

02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:34.540
And let's go to our green room and we're going to bring in the caller.

02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.420
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:37.420
Who's this?

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:40.020
Oh, it's the one and only DJ Ron mess.

02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:41.020
How is everybody doing?

02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:44.460
It is so good to actually see you, Rama.

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.460
How are you doing, Rama?

02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.460
I'm great.

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:50.620
I can tell that y'all got your gifts finally.

02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:51.620
Yes.

02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:54.540
I just saw Jamie held held hers up.

02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.540
And I sent you a picture of Mr. Smoosh with the patch.

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:57.940
I don't have it here next to me.

02:19:57.940 --> 02:19:58.940
But yeah.

02:19:58.940 --> 02:19:59.940
Right.

02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:00.940
And I have mine right here.

02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:03.540
So not as Oh, you got more than one.

02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:07.460
They sent me an extra one purely by accident.

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:11.140
When you pay for it, you're allowed to keep the extras, I think.

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:12.140
So it's awesome.

02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:13.140
I love it.

02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:14.140
Right.

02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:17.340
Well, it's like I said, it's glow in the dark.

02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:19.660
I got to try that part out, actually, to us.

02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:22.020
So to what do we owe this fabulous phone call tonight?

02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:27.580
Well, I want to talk about something real quick from last week's show up and something

02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:33.340
that had mentioned and I agree with what she said, but at the same time, I'm kind of hesitant

02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:34.340
about it.

02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.820
It's about unionizing the whole gaming industry.

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:38.180
Okay.

02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:42.820
I agree, you know, that the gaming industry should be unionized.

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:49.500
But my issue is that some unions can be so powerful that it can screw over, you know,

02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:55.580
the everyday person, you know, and sometimes that union can also screw over to people that

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.940
put money into it because I used to be a union guy working in a supermarket.

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:04.340
And yes, the union will take care of you as any problems, any issues, take it to your

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:05.340
shop steward.

02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:08.300
I was like that for the two weeks I worked at a grocery store.

02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:09.300
Mm hmm.

02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:11.620
So they will take care of you.

02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:17.440
I remember something had happened and they investigated and they looked at me like, well,

02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.020
we can't help you.

02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:20.520
Here is your last day.

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:21.520
Here is your paycheck.

02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:25.260
And I'm just like, this incident was not even my fault.

02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:27.140
So how am I getting the blame?

02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:29.740
Oh, because I was on shift when it happened.

02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:33.400
So that's some bullshit.

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:36.960
You bring up a good point, though, is that we talk about, you know, union, it does have

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:42.280
to be the right union and it has to be done in a way where it's for the employees.

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:47.240
That's also kind of why I and again, I do support the unionization of the industry,

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.960
but I'm also at the mindset where I'm like, it's not going to happen overnight.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.040
It's not going to happen tomorrow.

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.520
That is going to be a years long process.

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.400
And also unions need to be smaller, I think.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:58.400
Right.

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:03.520
And that's kind of why I'm like, we at least need these types of like legal defense funds

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:10.080
or things that at least bring the people together as a bridge to that as the first step to kind

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:15.160
of getting there, I think is is my my a little bit more, I think, I think realistic.

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:18.560
I see realistic approach, but I kind of think that's where that's where it's coming from

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.560
for me.

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:21.000
No, I totally get that.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.500
And I remember, you know, like if I'm not mistaken in the United States, there's less

02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:30.500
than 10 Starbucks locations that are unionized and like three or four of them are in New

02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:33.860
York City.

02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:40.780
And like one of the big unions out here is a TWU 100 that handles the bus drivers and

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:41.780
subway.

02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:46.060
And when they went on strike, basically that brought New York City to its knees because

02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:47.780
how are you going to get somewhere?

02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:48.780
You know.

02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:49.780
Mm hmm.

02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:52.940
And that's also the power of that union.

02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:53.940
That's true.

02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:54.940
Right.

02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:56.420
They had a New York cripple for about a week.

02:22:56.420 --> 02:22:58.820
They went back to the table.

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:04.220
Contracts were hammered out by I do what you have to do that everybody else in the union

02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:10.180
gets their fair share, but at the same time, try not to, you know, put the screws to somebody,

02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:12.460
you know.

02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:18.180
Who is I even remotely related to it, and I can say this much if a gaming company is

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:23.020
under a union and let's say, you know, they're at the table negotiating and there's issues

02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:24.540
with the contract.

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:26.180
This company goes on strike.

02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:31.560
The most that will happen is a bunch of games will not be released for a lot of us.

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:36.460
It's not a big deal because we have backlogs of we're used to it.

02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:37.460
Yeah.

02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:38.460
Basically.

02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:41.820
And for some, you got some who will be screaming and crying because they've been waiting for

02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:43.140
this game for so long.

02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:44.140
They want it now.

02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:49.140
And I'm like, look, I can wait another three weeks.

02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:50.140
Exactly.

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:51.140
Exactly.

02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:59.420
Like, like when Cyberpunk got delayed, I'm like, well, I got more time to be delayed

02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:00.420
longer.

02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:01.420
Yeah.

02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:04.340
I'm waiting for that game to drop to 19 before I pick it up.

02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:09.180
So it just it does surprise me, especially when we're constantly making comparisons of

02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:13.440
the gaming industry to Hollywood and that, you know, that other artistic industry.

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:18.320
And you look at Hollywood, there's unions up the wazoo that can bring that industry

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:19.320
to its knees.

02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:20.320
Hello.

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:24.520
Do you remember the Writers Guild strike that pretty much killed the TV show Heroes?

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.380
That was pretty good.

02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:30.160
And then the Writers Guild strike kind of, you know, that all happened.

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:31.160
And but I understand.

02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:34.800
I'm not saying I'm just saying that people remember it because of those types of things

02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:35.800
that happen.

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:38.960
SAG-AFTRA, of course, is a huge one.

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.500
Directors Guild, you know, you name it like there's unions for it in the Hollywood space.

02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:48.280
So it is weird to me that in the gaming space, which is quite frankly, a very similar industry,

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.280
we don't have shit.

02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:51.280
Yeah.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.320
And like, I know I have friends that are in SAG-AFTRA and it's interesting, like, if they're

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.320
since they're voice actors.

02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.320
We have some mutual friends.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:00.480
Yep, definitely.

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:06.320
Some of them have to go under alternate names to do non-union stuff, you know, so it's kind

02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:07.320
of crazy.

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:10.320
So, yeah.

02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:13.780
Another comment here from Mr. Chio 100 Matt, I think some industries need more representation

02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:16.680
from, say, a union rep than other industries.

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.280
Gaming has gotten to the point where it needs it.

02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:22.120
Folks are being taken advantage of hours and night, rights wise, excuse me.

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.720
If it means that some games take longer to make, then I'm all for it.

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:28.060
At least the folks behind the game aren't sleeping under their desk working 60 hours

02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:29.060
a week.

02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:30.060
Preach.

02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:32.800
And I agree, nobody should be working that long.

02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:33.800
I mean, hell.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.800
It's unhealthy.

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:37.560
I work in IT.

02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:40.400
You would think that it's normal nine to five.

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:45.760
Sometimes we are there till late, you know, and thankfully most places I've worked at

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.480
managers have come like, well, here's a voucher for food or here's this, here's that.

02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:54.720
And I know people who have worked longer hours than I have who do on-sites and they don't

02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:57.480
even get that type of stuff, you know?

02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:05.160
And thankfully with the IT I do, I'm glad that I'm doing what I do and not what you

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:09.400
do, even though people.

02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:12.520
The funny thing is I love what I do.

02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:13.520
Yeah.

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:14.520
And I love what I do.

02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:15.760
I'm like, I'm used to it.

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:25.200
I'm like, I've had VIPs, VPs, SVPs, yelling at me over something that's not my fault.

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.200
Fix it.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:31.400
Next thing you know, my manager's thanking me on, a long letter like this, thanking me

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:32.400
for the work that I did.

02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.760
I'm just like, just doing my job.

02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.520
I like what Finara says, IT industry.

02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:38.560
You don't see the sun.

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.720
You go in when it's dark and you get out when it's dark.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:43.640
That sounds like one of my jobs.

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:48.200
Once we worked and we had the window covered up and a sign on the door that says, you must

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.040
call the help desk if you need anything.

02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:53.160
About once in, we were told to take the sign down.

02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:58.080
Well, at least we could see the light of the outside windows, you know?

02:26:58.080 --> 02:26:59.080
Yeah.

02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:01.880
Well, and then when you do what I do, it's like, I don't need to call the help desk.

02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.520
I do this for a living.

02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:06.000
And then you have to call the help desk.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.760
I have been there working at another company.

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.760
Well, we can't fix it here.

02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:15.600
We have to call retail IT to have them remote in, reboot it, and then we take it from there.

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:20.800
It's just funny when you work, and I can't say where I work, I would get in a lot of

02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:27.320
trouble, but like when you have your own IT group for what you do, and then you also have

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:28.840
to work with engineers.

02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:30.920
I completely understand.

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:36.200
Since I no longer work for a company, I worked for about a year at Microsoft, so I completely

02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.200
understand.

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.160
All right.

02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:45.760
Well, now this is turning into IT venting session, which is okay, but yeah.

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.760
I'm sure both of us have stories.

02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:49.760
Right?

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.760
Yeah.

02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:53.760
Don't make me get the pitos.

02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:59.480
Rama, before I wrap up, do you want to give us a cheap plug for Anime Jam Session, please

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:00.480
do?

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:01.480
Sure, definitely.

02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:05.600
Check us out at Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays at 9.30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Tuesday

02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:10.120
nights, and this week we'll be talking about what happened at Eddie Magic.

02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:12.800
The lines were up to two to three hours to get in.

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:17.020
People were painting due to heat stroke.

02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:18.440
People were bringing water.

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:22.960
They had a special section for people who are waiting for the EMT.

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:30.200
It looked like, imagine walking in the AX three years ago with what's going on right

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:31.200
now.

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.080
That's how it looked inside.

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.080
Oh.

02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.120
Did I ever tell you about Sacramento Pride 2019?

02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:39.120
No.

02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:47.960
They were overcrowded, actually a lot of the EMTs were being pulled away, and people were

02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:51.160
having heat stroke left and right, but people were trying to stay to see Lizzo.

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:53.200
I was like, that was the Lizzo concert, wasn't it?

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.200
That was a Lizzo concert.

02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:58.360
That was way too big of a name for that venue.

02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:04.760
But yeah, you've got to have, you have to anticipate the worst case scenario, especially

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.760
at an anime con.

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.760
I mean, please.

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:07.760
Yeah.

02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:12.200
I think this is like their first year, so of course mistakes will happen, but this is

02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:13.200
like-

02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:15.600
This is mistakes that could really hurt people.

02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:16.600
Exactly.

02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:17.600
Exactly.

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.600
All right.

02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:20.560
Well, tune in on Tuesday night for more.

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:25.760
Rama, so happy to have you here as one of our first callers here in this revitalized

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.440
call-in segment here on OLR.

02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:28.520
I like your shirt.

02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:29.920
Big hearts for you as well.

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.920
All right.

02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:31.920
Here's mine.

02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.240
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:36.240
Love it.

02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:37.240
All right, my friend.

02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.240
We'll see you next time.

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.240
All right.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.240
Thanks for being here.

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.240
Take care, buddy.

02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:42.240
Stay fabulous.

02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:43.240
You too.

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.240
All right.

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.240
Bye.

02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:46.240
All right.

02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:52.120
You know what that made me remember is Slidekick's old podcast, Fabulous Flames.

02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:53.680
Oh, my husband was on that podcast.

02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:54.680
Fabulous Flames.

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:55.680
That's right.

02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:56.680
Oh, that's right.

02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:57.920
It was the best.

02:29:57.920 --> 02:29:59.560
It was the best name.

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:00.560
It really was.

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:05.360
And anytime someone thinks it says fabulous, I think of that podcast to this day.

02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.600
It's really a shame it's not still around.

02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:09.840
I mean, none of those people play wow anymore.

02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.700
And I'll just I'll spill tea.

02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:13.720
Their third host was such a negative Nancy.

02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:14.720
I couldn't stand it.

02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.120
Like, don't do a show about a game if you're just going to shit on the game.

02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:22.960
But do not piss in my cornflakes.

02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:23.960
Piss in somebody else's.

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:28.520
I loved hearing Alan and Slidekick talk about wow and all that.

02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:30.160
It's gone too soon.

02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:31.160
Pour one out.

02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:33.360
I see Alan's in the kitchen, but he has his earbuds in.

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:34.520
So he's listening to something else.

02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:35.520
It's not this program.

02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:36.520
Hi, Alan.

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:38.240
Oh, he heard that one.

02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:39.240
Hi.

02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:40.240
We're just talking about you.

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:42.640
Alan, do you remember Fabulous Flames?

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:46.280
Yeah, he just made this face.

02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:47.280
He made this face.

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:48.280
So I'm going to try to read.

02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:49.280
Sorry, podcast.

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:50.280
I'm going to do this back of the camera.

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.280
He made this face like this.

02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:53.280
Yes.

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:54.600
Alright.

02:30:54.600 --> 02:31:00.280
Anyway, um, let's see.

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:03.960
I think we might have touched on our last minute stories already, but I will ask Dark

02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:08.320
Soccer if there's anything else she wants to bring up here for last minute stories.

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:15.120
Um, well, it's not really like a big news thing, but it's something I do want to warn

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:17.960
my fellow DVD players.

02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:20.320
The disconnect penalty is back.

02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:23.520
I noticed that on some streams I was watching.

02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.360
Yes, yes, for sure.

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:26.360
All right.

02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:27.360
Um, okay.

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:28.880
Uh, that's it.

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:31.800
We're going to wrap up, get some final thoughts, but first I'm going to tell you, thank you

02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:35.760
so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio or Listening Live and, uh, tuning into the

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.200
show and supporting us.

02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:40.900
If you liked what you heard here on the show, please tell a friend or two, help us spread

02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:43.440
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:45.520
But if the gamers aren't here, we can't share their voices.

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:48.920
Like we just had Rama on a minute ago to share his voice and we hope to get more of you in

02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:49.920
the coming weeks.

02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:53.280
So thank you so much to those of you that were here in chat tonight and of course everybody

02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:58.120
who downloads the show throughout the week on iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, whatever

02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:01.720
it is you listen to podcasts on, thank you so much for, uh, putting Orange Launch Radio

02:32:01.720 --> 02:32:04.040
in your rotation and being a part of the show.

02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:11.560
Uh, if you feel so inclined, you can always, uh, shop our merch store, uh, over at vognetwork.com

02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:18.500
slash uh, shop if you'd like to do that and, um, I think that's, that's all I have to say

02:32:18.540 --> 02:32:19.540
for my cheap plugs.

02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:23.060
So, uh, thank you, SJ100Matt for sending that, uh, link out there.

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:24.060
So thank you again.

02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:25.060
Uh, final thoughts.

02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:27.180
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:31.060
I want people to stay with me tonight while I play because it gets really lonely playing

02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:32.060
by myself.

02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:33.060
Pretty please?

02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:34.060
All right.

02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:38.820
I got to edit the show or it won't get done sadly.

02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:40.900
I try to try to kind of have it running on my phone though.

02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:41.900
Well that, that's fine.

02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:42.900
Rob, you get a pass.

02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:43.900
Okay.

02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:44.900
Yeah.

02:32:44.900 --> 02:32:47.660
But, um, but, uh, I am going to go ahead and turn off my camera cause I have to set up

02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:48.700
the OBS cameras.

02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:50.220
So no worries.

02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:51.220
So take care.

02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.220
We'll see you next time.

02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:53.220
Dark Soccer.

02:32:53.220 --> 02:33:00.000
And then my final thought for tonight is, um, I don't know, I'm, I'm, I hope this thing

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.240
heals up cause there's an ingress thing I want to go to Wednesday and I'd like to actually

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.980
be able to socialize with people.

02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:09.940
Um, except if I still have all these bandages on my neck, I don't know how, uh, easily possible

02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:10.940
that's going to be.

02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.620
Uh, so we'll just take it as it comes.

02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:18.020
Anyway, uh, thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

Happy gaming, whatever it is you decide to play.

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:23.460
