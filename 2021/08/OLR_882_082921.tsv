0	13820	Gamescom's presentation has come and gone and I keep seeing comments about a resounding
13820	17800	meh, which I think is awfully ironic but maybe this is just my Aunt or Grandpa Simpson coming
17800	22160	out yet again. Meanwhile, I'll be over here waiting to play another horror game involving
22160	27920	a camera so I can ramp up my personal paranoia all over again. Horror games done right.
27920	30840	This is one of many headlines you expected to hear and now it's time for your hosts Rob
30840	33800	Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to go into detail about this and the rest of the week's
33800	36680	gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36680	46720	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
46720	54040	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode
54040	61760	number 882 of our show for this August the 29th of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and let's
61760	66040	talk about video games. We're going to talk about some video games with my co-hosts. Say
66040	69760	hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi.
69760	73520	Hi. You're looking great. I love your new hair that you have.
73520	76800	Oh yeah, let me. Hold on, hold on. I have to do it.
76800	81880	While you do it. Which folks can see if they... Yes, she's shaking out her hair. Sorry. Which
81880	88320	folks can see if they watch live over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network or VOG Network.
88320	92520	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
92520	96680	But we know it's a podcast. We try not to rely too much on the visuals, but I had to
96680	101440	comment on DarkSakura's red lovely hair she's got going on there. So kudos.
101440	104480	It's a gradient. Kudos to your barber, whoever they may be.
104480	109720	Well, thank you. My, my, my friend Hillary is awesome. She does great work. She is worth
109720	117440	every penny I pay. But this was a long time coming. Cause you remember when I went black?
117440	121480	I do. Of course. Yeah. Well, we let it grow and we let it grow and
121480	126000	we let it grow just for the sake of being able to do a red to black gradient.
126000	130120	Oh, clever. Some advanced planning. I like that. We do.
130120	132880	There are pictures of me blonde and y'all will never see them.
132880	138760	We do have our live chat room that gives us some comments here. Pod Culture mentions Sassy
138760	146360	do. So, uh, yeah, I think, uh, I think, uh, this is a very clearly you could be in a shampoo
146360	150640	commercial if you wanted, but anyway, well, it's just expensive styling products.
150640	156600	All right. Also say hello to tech master Loki with the short, short hair that, uh, isn't
156600	161320	gradient or styled, but that's okay. Hi lucky. It doesn't have to be too short. That's okay.
161320	165400	You don't have to hide yours under a hat. Like I do. Cause mine's, mine's a little out
165400	169680	of control right now. Cause, uh, it's about time to shave the hide yours either. I don't.
169680	173800	And actually I've done a few shows here at OLR without a hat, but here's the thing, uh,
173800	178440	with dragon con coming up this week, I'm actually waiting until like the last minute to give
178440	182520	myself a fresh buzz and then I'll go out to, uh, dragon con.
182520	188240	Le Bald. So, uh, uh, those that, those that I will see there this year, you have that
188240	192760	to look forward to so under the hat, but I will still have plenty of hats at dragon con.
192760	197600	Uh, Loki, what is the game playing behind you tonight on Twitch? You usually run a little
197600	203360	video game behind you there on the green screen. It's a shadow run on the SNES. Oh, it sure
203360	206520	is. It took me a minute to recognize it. And the minute you said it, I'm like, it sure
206520	210360	is shadow because my head's in the way. So you can't really see it. Yeah. Yeah. But I
210360	214000	can see enough now that I make out the character and there was a screen just before that. I
214000	218360	gotcha. That's a classic. That's a good one. Um, I was playing games today too. We will
218360	222240	get into our gaming weeks here after we do the kickoff topic, but I have to quickly mention
222240	227720	I ran into the studio not long before showtime. So I was a little better than I was expecting,
227720	233480	but I went to an ingress event this morning in San Francisco. So, uh, my buddy is that
233480	237320	who sometimes listens to the show who also plays the game. Uh, we got in a car here at
237320	241600	nine AM, drove out to San Francisco. We actually got there. Traffic, the traffic gods were
241600	245800	very good today. We parked at about 10 45, which is kind of unheard of for a trip to
245800	249720	San Francisco to only really actually be an hour and a half. And then, uh, we, we did
249720	253120	what's called a mission day, did a bunch of missions around there and they did this
253120	256840	thing called a van event where you like hack the van basically. Uh, and then we got in
256840	260600	the car and came back and, uh, the traffic gods were a little meaner on the way home,
260600	264840	but I still made pretty good time home. So, uh, hacking a van, isn't that like hot wiring?
264840	268700	I, I, something like that. It's hacking the planet. No, I, I, is it one of those free
268700	274720	candy vans that I've heard about? Yes. Except it ties into the lore of ingress, but I don't
274720	278680	play video games for lore. Well, that's not true. Sometimes I really get into the lore.
278680	281800	Like a lot of the final fantasy games, there's many video games where I'm just like, I don't
281800	285520	care about the lore. I just want to play the game. And ingress is one of them. So the,
285520	290680	the van is something about detecting XM. I don't know, it plays with the story somehow.
290680	295000	So being able to, because it travels or it's a moving portal. So let me, let me, cause
295000	299800	I know hardly anyone plays ingress. So let me, um, let me give the analogy to Pokemon
299800	306600	go. Imagine if a Poke stop moved from city to city. That's, that's basically what the
306600	311960	van kind of is. Uh, which I guess actually the van has shown up as a temporary, uh, pokey
311960	315360	stop sometimes. Cause there are people will post it to Reddit going, what the hell is
315360	321840	this as a pokey stops. It's kind of funny. It's the government spying on you. It's fine.
321840	327560	That's right. Take this Pikachu in return. Here's all your, where you take all your privacy,
327560	331800	which is, which is honestly true. Uh, all right. We're just going to Pikachu at your
331800	340680	network package. How would you like to buy all of these Pokemon products now? Let's get
340680	344920	into the gaming news of the week. We're going to start off with our kickoff topic tonight
344920	348560	that has to do a games com because there was a quite a bit of information that came out
348560	353600	of, came out of games com about what to expect at this coming year, uh, including X-Box did
353600	358920	their own event. And then we had the opening light, opening light, opening night live event
358920	362960	from Jeff Keeley, you know, who does the game awards and has done, you know, uh, did
362960	367240	that E3 summer game Fest. So I feel like he does three or four of these types of big to
367240	370360	do press conference. I keep calling press conferences, but they're really like media
370360	375760	events, media spectacles, um, every year. And I I'm going to get just right into it
375760	382760	Loki cause I need the details because I saw the tweets. So opening night live, we talked
382760	388840	about this last week on OLR. We knew there was going to be a saints row reboot, uh, that
388840	392960	was going to be announced at this. It was, it was like way past rumor status to where
392960	397400	they were tweeting like teaser images and stuff. So they actually showed us a little
397400	402200	glimpse of what the next saints row game looks like. And saints row, I know is one of your
402200	406240	very favorite series, Loki, although you kind of, you kind of like the saints row two era
406240	407240	of the game.
407240	412560	Well, I still liked, I liked saints row. Okay. So like saints row as a game, let's just,
412560	418220	let's imagine. So they did announce the saints row reboot, which is just being so tell us
418220	420260	your thoughts, Loki on this reboot.
420260	424800	I'm good. I'm getting there. Okay. So they have the reboot that they announced it's coming
424800	432480	out February 25th, um, next year and it takes place in this new city called Santo Aliso,
432480	438300	which is kind of like, think of like a Vegas type of thing. And so it's a little bit more
438300	444620	of like that kind of, uh, type of environment or maybe like, um, Arizona, new Mexico, that
444620	452100	type of thing. Um, and so they, they showed it off like, and here's, here's a good indicator
452100	458740	of how I thought it was. So I saw the trailer and to myself before I even knew it was saints
458740	464140	row, I'm like, I really hope this isn't saints row. I really hope this isn't saints row.
464140	470980	And then I saw, you know, I forget to call it. Um, I saw the purple, I saw the symbols
470980	477900	and like, Oh God, it's, it is saints row. Isn't it? So here's the problem. So saints
477900	484820	row had a really great cast of characters that really kind of drove this series. Like
484820	493240	I always talk about like Johnny Gat in the game, like very awesome character. Um, and
493240	499580	you know, even just like Julius and like all really characters, you know, given to life
499580	507860	by like really big name stars, these characters were as generic as possibly it could be like,
507860	512620	and this is granted, this is not a gameplay trailer they showed. This is like a cinematic
512620	517500	trailer, I guess. But even, but even like with cinematic trailers, like in the past
517500	522380	with like saints row three and stuff, it had been really awesome. Like just really like
522380	526260	nailing home. This is the vibe of the game. Like this is going to be really cool. All
526260	531620	this, the only vibe I got from this is like, this is the most generic game I've ever seen.
531620	536100	Can I jump to the punchline here, Loki though? And that you're going to buy it anyway though,
536100	542820	right? I we'll see, but here's the thing. Okay. We'll see. So like probably I will buy
542820	546020	it, but like, here's the, here's the problem. And like, and don't get me wrong. Like I'm
546020	553380	sure the game is a good game, but what they showed does not convey anything about the
553380	558780	series. So for example, like one of the things that the, the voice actress or the actress
558780	565780	that was in the, the presentation basically said, I'm the new boss in this game. Not exactly.
565780	570380	Okay. Cause they do still have the character customization. She's basically playing the
570380	577940	female voice actress for the role. They, they usually have a male role as well, but it wasn't
577940	582340	conveyed at all. So right there, like people thought immediately, Oh, so there's no customization
582340	587580	anymore. And just, you know, what's up with that. And then, you know, it wasn't conveyed
587580	592540	also with the co-op the like co-op in the game. So there's a whole lot of details that
592540	598240	they didn't really talk about in gameplay that they showed was just so minimal and yeah,
598240	603060	the game looks like saints row when you play it, but also they talking about like, Oh,
603060	607020	let's bring it back a little bit less ridiculous and more realistic. Oh, but there's going
607020	614520	to be flying motorcycles and VTOLs and stuff like that. That's just Saints Row 3 again,
614520	618360	they're making Saints Row 3 again, but except this time they've taken out all of the good
618360	623520	characters in the game and they have these like knockoffs. It's like, it's like if Epic
623520	627380	games were copying Saints Row for Fortnite and these are the characters that they came
627380	633020	out with. Like we have Kevin now who is like the new Johnny Gat basically kind of taking
633020	641480	on that role like this crazy, you know, Daredevil type of guy. You've got the, the Pierce stand
641480	647300	in with Dion. I think I don't remember his name, but who cares? It's like, it's basically
647300	651860	like the hot new game is coming from Nintendo. It's super Mark O brothers and it's coming
651860	656620	out and they're like, Oh, and then this person, they're the driver. It's like, but you're
656620	661220	playing the game as your care is the boss and you're driving the car. Like, why do I
661220	667940	need a driver? I don't need a driver. I'm like, who cares? Like it's just, I don't know.
667940	671940	It just really didn't sell me on it. Like if you want to sell me on it, like in you
671940	677860	bringing it back, like rebooting the franchise, here's my expectation was like, okay, reboot
677860	682580	the franchise, but like with the same cast of characters in there and just do something
682580	687740	different with it. Like for example, if I'm going to reboot Tomb Raider as they did, and
687740	693940	I didn't put Laura Croft in there, people would be throwing a fit about it. You know,
693940	698300	this game, this is, uh, this is Tomb Raider with Mary craft is actually, uh, the star
698300	703300	of this, uh, new Tomb Raider game. Or if it were, if it were, if I reboot, like, you know,
703300	707820	street fighter and I took out all of the characters that you liked in it, but it's still street
707820	713660	fighter. You're still actually, actually data East did that and called it fighting street.
713660	723460	That's a very famous court case. That is street. There's another thing about that because
723460	729180	that was actually a release of street fighter for turbo graphics, I think. Oh, right. But
729180	731900	wasn't that the whole, wasn't that the whole, is somebody completely ripped them out of
731900	736460	fighting? No. Yeah. That's art of fighting. No fighting street was the data East thing.
736460	742060	Anyway, allow me to history. Okay. That was it. Here's where I start to get concerned
742060	746460	and, and I'm going to, I have to find the quotes because the quote, okay, here's where
746460	753460	I get concerned. So chief creative officer, Jim Boone was interviewed talking about saints
753460	759740	row and their, their inspiration for the game. Now, remember saints row was a game that was
759740	765860	basically gangsters. There was drug dealing. There was Robbie and convenience stores. There
765860	772200	was pimping. There was drug running. There was gun running, stealing cars, all the fun
772200	778540	things you look forward to video games. So here, here's the new saints row. It is broadly
778540	787260	a contemporary millennial power fantasy. These disinfected millennials turn to crime, for
787260	791460	instance, put food on their table, feel part of the community and pay off their student
791460	794980	loans. That is not saints row. I don't know. I don't know about you guys, but I've had
794980	797700	a few millennial power fantasies in my day.
797700	802380	I don't know. I would, I would have turned to, to crime to pay off my student loans.
802380	804140	They were pretty expensive.
804140	808640	It is not saints for growth. Like this is just ridiculous. And the characters that they
808640	814540	show, I swear to God, it's like, it's like clout chasing, Tik TOK fantasy game. I mean,
814540	819200	that's what it is. It's just, it's stupid. And I get it that it's supposed to be like
819200	824260	a saints row game, but it really is not. It's like, you're trying to reboot. You're trying
824300	828940	to create another game and you're throwing the saints row label on it. Like you killed
828940	832880	the franchise. You basically killed the franchise rebooting. It's not going to help at this
832880	838540	point, like best of luck to you. And here's the thing. The game could be pretty good and
838540	842820	there may be are very engaging characters in it. I did not get that from the trailer.
842820	847580	I certainly didn't give that from their comments by the current, the creative leads, which
847580	853180	has been concerned. So the messaging could be bad. The messaging is terrible. It's, it's
853300	862220	you can't do worse than that. Like, and this is a company that had, um, uncle Busey, you
862220	867940	know, promoting saints, which was fantastic. Gary Busey promoting saints real too hilarious.
868220	873460	But like, I just, he is, he's crazy. And that, that was the whole point. It was like, he's
873460	879020	talking about weapons and stuff and it was great. And that's, you can do stuff, you can
879020	884820	dial it back in a way. Like if you want to make it like, I get it, like maybe pimping in a game
884820	891700	that comes out in 2021 is not PC enough for the mainstream audience nowadays. That's fine. Take
891700	898020	that out. Okay. Whatever. You know, but like going back to even saints row, the third, they didn't
898020	903740	have drug dealing in it. It was dealing your merch, which was stupid to begin with. But like, I
903740	907900	get the point, like they were just trying to do the same mini game, but like, Oh, we're making it
907900	912620	even more rated G or something for everybody. They're covering their asses. Well, whatever.
912620	918300	It's a, it's a mature rated game. They don't have to like it. They don't do that in grand theft auto,
918300	923500	like take the chances, take the risk. Well, but if that was the case, hot coffee would have still
923500	928220	been in the game in grand theft auto days. There are certain things that they don't want to cross
928220	933420	because they don't want to end up on the NBC nightly news. But that's just, it just wasn't
933500	940540	the time. Here's the problem. It is a very American thing. This country has a bigger
940540	947980	problem with sex than it does with violence. Just saying. Yeah. And I get the, I get the idea. They
947980	953340	have to dial it back because like, where do you go from ripping off the matrix and the, you know,
953340	959340	the head of the saints is the president and you know, you've gone into space and stuff of like,
959340	963900	that doesn't make any sense anymore. Like what game is that? Even like it may be a fun game,
963900	968940	but it sounds, it is, it's a parody of a parody. Um, and I get it. You have to dial it back. I
968940	974220	think, like I said, you know, I'm a big fan of Saints Row 2. I thought that that kind of took
975020	979500	what Saints Row had originally established and took it to the next level. Like there was
979500	983740	ridiculous stuff in there that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Like there was a mini game where
983740	988860	you set yourself on fire and drove around on an ATV. Cool. That's that's ridiculous. That's a
988940	993980	little bit extreme. You could rip out and you can rip out signposts and fire hydrants and stuff like
993980	999740	that in like fight people with that. Like that's ridiculous. I did that yesterday, but that's also
999740	1004460	a little bit more grounded in reality. Like I, I, I hear them saying that, Oh yes, we're going to
1004460	1009740	make this game, you know, we're going to dial it back and stuff. And it's like, but once again,
1009740	1015100	they have the same, almost the same factions that they did is Saints Row the third. It's like the
1015100	1020300	remaking Saints Row the third. We've got, we've got this one faction that, you know, Oh, they're
1020300	1024940	kind of cyber technology. Okay. Well that's like in Saints Row the third. Oh, we have this other
1024940	1029420	faction, you know, they're more of like muscle and stuff like that. Okay. Like the luchadors.
1029420	1034300	Um, and then, Oh yeah. And then we've got this, you know, kind of security company. Oh, you mean
1034300	1039740	like in Saints Row the third, they're literally remaking Saints Row the third again for the fourth
1039740	1044620	time. Like, all right. I got, I got to get some comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash
1044620	1049100	vog network. Uh, we had a comment about the gameplay. I wanted to read here. She Hulk 10
1049100	1055420	in our chat says the actual gameplay part looked last gen Xbox three 60 era graphics. That's why
1055420	1059420	they chopped it up with video cut scenes. They only showed like four seconds of gameplay, right?
1059420	1065180	They did only show like a few seconds of gameplay. They've also done early. They know they also had,
1065180	1069500	they showed some more like in another, they've been doing these clips where like they had some,
1069500	1074140	I literally thought like I saw videos coming out and I thought that it was going to be an
1074140	1079260	apology video for such a terrible like trailer that they did, but no, instead it was just more
1079260	1083340	than doubling down on that. And they did show a little bit more gameplay footage than that, but
1083340	1086940	it looks like Saints Row. I mean, that's what it is. It looks like Saints Row, but the problem is
1086940	1092540	like, like the, yeah, the gameplay could be solid, but the care you need characters and like, yeah,
1092540	1097660	I get it. Maybe Kevin is a really cool character. I didn't get that from it. It just felt ridiculous.
1097660	1103180	It felt, it felt stupid. He does, the characters lacked charisma. Like,
1103180	1108540	whereas in the first game, like this nerve and talent, you, you really like, you know,
1110300	1114380	kind of like really get attached to these characters and like just their storylines.
1114380	1119980	They have depth to them, but like these characters meant nothing to me. And if it's like, Oh, these,
1119980	1123260	they're, they're college students and they have student loans and stuff like that. Like,
1124220	1129020	I'm sorry that like, what is this? Like, it's like, it's a millennial power fantasy.
1129580	1133980	It's like, it's so stupid. It's like, is this what they really think gangsters are nowadays?
1133980	1138540	It's just like people like, well, we're going to go. And even that trailer was stupid. It's
1138540	1145100	just like, Oh yeah, we're starting a criminal enterprise. Like, it's just like, it's stupid.
1145100	1151020	All right, grandpa, let's get you to bed. No, I get it. I get, I get, I understand the concerns.
1151020	1156380	A lot of the community, a lot of the community, here's the only reason I will, I will take a
1156380	1163980	chance on this game is because idle Ninja, who we'll get to about later, said that, listen,
1163980	1168700	like he had contributed to like, you know, feedback and stuff for it and said that the
1168700	1173740	game that they're making looks really positive and looks like a pretty solid game. So I will
1174540	1180060	give it a chance based on that. But so far, the marketing has been absolutely terrible.
1180060	1183500	And if this is the direction that they're going, it's just going to not be good.
1183500	1188620	There's been a lot of games where the marketing wasn't very good, but the game ended up being a
1188620	1193180	little bit better than that. I mean, honestly, like my brain, the first place my brain goes
1193180	1201020	is the entire Sony PlayStation 3 unveiling concert unveiling event, right? I mean, all this talk
1201020	1206060	about Ridge Racer and giant enemy crabs. I mean, all that stuff. I mean, I don't think that
1206060	1212380	particular game was notable, but all that stuff ended up out, out shadowing all the games
1212380	1217820	themselves. It's more, that's more of an awkward and out of touch versus like, this is just in,
1217820	1221580	this has been the contention for a while now. Like people have been asking for certain things
1221580	1227580	like Saints Row the Third. Once again, they made, I don't know if they don't, if Volition knows how
1227580	1231900	to craft a good story is I think the problem because like in Saints Row the Third, they're
1231900	1236220	like, yeah, we're going to, we're going to kill off one of the fan's favorite characters because
1236220	1240220	Ooh, you didn't see that twist coming. Like that was the reasoning for behind it. Like,
1240220	1244700	Oh, it will have some emotional impact. Yeah. People getting mad at you for doing that.
1244700	1249180	Like, and then they, then they like try to retcon it in the next game. They're all this kidding. He,
1249180	1256540	he got abducted by aliens. He didn't really die. It's like, come on. Like it is, it's just really
1256540	1260780	stupid. And I think that they don't know how to craft a story and I get it there. There is
1261660	1265660	a, you know, I don't want to dog on the developers here, but like, dude, look at the stuff that you're
1265660	1269740	putting out. Like, look at how like the people you're talking heads are putting out this kind
1269740	1273420	of stuff. Like what am I supposed to think at this point? Like, I get it. I don't have to buy
1273420	1279100	your game, but I don't know. I I'm very skeptical that this is going to be good at this point. It'll
1279100	1284380	be solid gameplay, but. DJ Rama S in chat says, I think we need to wait until more info on the
1284380	1289580	game comes out. Well, I mean, perhaps there's somewhat negative reception. I mean, of course,
1289580	1294220	we're just, I mean, in, in this bubble, we're just hearing from Loki, but I do feel like on the
1294220	1299820	wider, like social media and stuff, I don't feel like that trailer landed as big as people hoped
1299820	1305180	it would. And I think maybe I know Loki, you weren't as into the over the top comedy, but I
1305180	1313580	think that being completely missing was kind of damaging. I, and I think he goes, yeah, what's
1313580	1319420	what's considered over the top, like the, the space alien thing. And like, I'll read this
1319420	1324700	comment bonds. Double 06 says Epic game store gave away saints row, third remaster. That is true.
1324700	1328620	And the first question my girlfriend asked after seeing the trailer, do we still get the
1328620	1335260	penetrator? So that, that is, I think what people are talking about. Yeah. You won't get that
1335260	1340860	because that is too offensive nowadays. I know many millennials that have a giant purple dildo
1340860	1346700	bad as their power fantasy. So they sold it. I mean, people have that. It's just like,
1347500	1352220	yeah, that unfortunately nowadays people are going to take offense to it. And so they're not going to
1352220	1357820	put it in their game. Like I am fine with that. Who cares? The weapon was stupid. It was just like,
1357820	1362780	he, he looked at what we did. Like, you know, there's other things that they could do that
1362780	1371340	the saints row games have a really like, they really like to dive into this crazy BDSM
1371340	1375980	scene that they have in, in a lot of them. So there's a lot of like these weird
1376620	1383260	missions revolving around that kind of stuff. So I, are they going to still do that? Who knows?
1383260	1387500	I, I, I'm not even getting into like the details with that stuff. Like I don't care about weapons
1387500	1392300	and stuff right now. I'm more considering like, who are the characters? Who's the story about here?
1393180	1397820	And so far, I'm not liking what I'm seeing. All right. They're not interesting. All right.
1397820	1402460	Enough saints row. We've gone 20 minutes about saints row. Let's talk about some of the other
1402460	1407820	stuff at games com. So Loki, what were some of the other things we saw I guess in the opening
1407820	1413340	night or the Xbox or wherever you want to start? Yeah, sure. So starting off with like the Xbox
1413340	1420540	stuff more games, you know, we saw a new trailer for dying light two, which looks pretty awesome.
1420540	1427580	And that's supposed to be coming out here pretty soon. 7th of December. We've also got some more
1427580	1435660	footage of Microsoft flight simulator, which looks pretty cool. There is going to be, I guess,
1435660	1442460	some deal to bring a lot of the humble games to Xbox game pass on day one. So if you don't
1442460	1447900	remember humble is now also a publisher of games. So some of those indie games will be coming as
1447900	1456140	well. Let's see more stuff about games past ultimate and cloud gaming on Xbox consoles is
1456140	1463980	holiday. So that's pretty awesome that you've been able to do that. We had some DLC announced
1463980	1472220	for wasteland three, the holy detonation. It's more sea of thieves stuff. The mayhem ship they
1472220	1482140	had. So those are kind of cool stated decay to homecoming straight blade, lots of different stuff.
1482140	1489260	But yeah, I think I didn't get to see this, but I know that they ended with Forza horizon five,
1489260	1495740	which looks amazing. So definitely want to check that out eventually. So yeah. Yeah. Sadly,
1495740	1498940	I couldn't watch either one of these. I really just had to see the highlight reel just because
1498940	1503900	the timing was right in the middle of the workday, which, you know, it's it games com is a Europe
1503900	1507740	centered event. So yes, the time zones work out that it's a little earlier in the day for us.
1507740	1513500	But yeah, sadly, I kind of had to hear about this stuff after the fact, but I need to go back and
1513500	1517820	watch that Forza horizon five extra footage because apparently it shows the intro of the game,
1518940	1523820	which Forza horizon four had such a good one. Yeah, it's just it'll be interesting to see how
1523820	1533420	they top it. Yeah. And then let's see. So with the games com live, they're opening night stuff.
1533980	1538860	So aside from Saints Row, they showed off a trailer for Midnight Sons, which apparently
1538860	1548220	is that new strategy RPG from the folks that make Xcom. So that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I have some
1548220	1553900	people very excited about that. I've checked that out, too. Yeah. So that looked interesting. They
1553900	1559420	showed a trailer for Call of Duty Vanguard, the single player campaign for that. And that's coming
1559420	1565180	out November 5th. Looked like Call of Duty looked pretty cinematic. So pretty awesome.
1566300	1572380	Show off some new trailer for Halo Infinite. They had one for like the multiplayer as well.
1574140	1578940	We had this cool indie game called Cult of the Lamb that's coming from Devolver Digital.
1581180	1588380	Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. Yay. That's got a bunch of like characters, including Morgana.
1589420	1596380	And what else? They showed off a trailer for Lego Star Wars, the Skywalker Saga, which has now
1596380	1601180	been pushed back even more. So I think that's coming out next year now. The Outlast Trials,
1601180	1608700	in case you haven't played enough of the Outlast series. What else we get?
1608700	1612940	In case you didn't poop your pants enough playing the first two Outlast games. Here you go. Here's
1612940	1618300	a new one. Yeah, they have another trailer for Far Cry 6, which is coming out in this October.
1619420	1623580	Trailer for New World, which is coming out at the end of September. Age of Empires 4,
1625100	1632380	Valheim Hearth and Home, which I'm not sure if that's oh, that's an update that they're doing
1632380	1639020	with some balancing changes. Sifu, which is that kind of stylized martial arts game.
1639660	1645980	Death Stranding Director's Cut, which looks weird. What was all that weird side stuff they had in it?
1646060	1651180	They had a Mario Kart game type of thing in it. It's shenanigans.
1651180	1653980	We're just going to put all of the game into the game.
1653980	1659980	It is, but I'm not going to lie. I'm kind of into it. And I do want to get it whenever I get a
1659980	1664700	PlayStation 5. But I think I'll kind of wait for the newness to wear off a little bit so that it
1664700	1670780	maybe goes on sale a bit. But yeah, I have to admit all this extra stuff in Death Stranding,
1670780	1676780	some of it is so absurd. I kind of have to see it just because the game itself was so
1677740	1682540	such a unique mood. I don't want to use any negative terms because I actually really enjoyed
1682540	1687180	the game, but it was very unique for a video game. And so the fact that they're adding kind
1687180	1694220	of these silly tropes into it is fascinating to me. Then they have this other game called Dokke V,
1694220	1699260	which is almost like a, not necessarily like a Pokemon game, but it's a monster catching game.
1700780	1706220	Where you catch like a Dokke V, they say, where you exist with these monsters. But it's like,
1707420	1710620	kind of looks better than like Pokemon. Pokemon the hardcore.
1711420	1715180	It's like Pokemon, but it looks pretty awesome. Like, I don't know.
1715180	1722300	Yeah, I'm curious to hear more about it. So they have that. And I think that was pretty
1722300	1728140	much everything. Yeah. I mean, there was a lot. I mean, that opening night live was like a two
1728140	1732460	hour long thing. It was a long presentation, but you know, lots of good updates in there,
1732460	1737420	especially considering the bulk of what is coming out the rest of the year. We know about at this
1737420	1741260	point, you know, there's not going to be really any more holiday surprises. There may be a little
1741260	1743900	thing here or there, but there's not going to be any big surprises at this point. Well, they
1743900	1748380	can always, I mean, Nintendo does their own thing whenever they want to. But even then I wouldn't
1748380	1754620	set the bar too high for a Nintendo surprise. Oh gosh. My, my bar with Nintendo is incredibly low.
1754620	1759820	I would say like a Nintendo surprise would be Tetris 99 type of thing, you know, and I'm not
1759820	1766460	saying literally that, but you know, something in that caliber, like Pac-Man 99 kind of ended
1766460	1772060	up being so, or whatever it's called. There I'm not, well, maybe there will be another 99 game,
1772060	1775020	who knows, but I would think something in that kind of vein is where to, you know,
1775020	1779900	aim appropriately when it comes to big surprise for the holiday. Orange Ride in Chat says,
1779900	1783340	I'm sure people will still believe Nintendo is going to bring the great pumpkin.
1784620	1790540	Possibly. Yeah. A lot of people on Twitter and social media set the bar too high when it comes
1790540	1802940	to Nintendo. So probably. Oh, comment from Tiger Claw, who I know watches all things Ninja Turtles
1802940	1808220	very carefully. Is a big week for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as April was announced in Shredder's
1808220	1814060	Revenge. Yes. That, I did see a little bit on that, you know, it's, it's basically a throwback
1814060	1818060	to the old Ninja Turtles arcade game, right? Though the Ninja Turtles game, everybody loved,
1818060	1825260	right? And now they're, you know, kind of the, the Shredder's Revenge is very much that,
1825260	1831020	but, you know, for, for 2021 and now April is actually playable in it, which is kind of neat.
1832620	1836140	The fact that she kind of beats people with their microphones kind of fun. I've wanted to do the
1836140	1844300	same thing several times. So pretty fun. All right. Yeah. Let's talk about some things we
1844300	1848380	have been playing this week, not just the stuff we're looking forward to. Let's get into a segment
1848380	1851900	called how was your gaming week and what are the types of games you've been playing this week?
1851900	1858380	Dr. Sakura, we'll start with you. I did finally get my start back on Final Fantasy 14.
1860220	1863340	They put me right back on the same server my other two characters were on,
1864140	1869580	even though I tried something different. So whatever. And of course I played Dead
1869580	1876380	by Daylight. Apparently, and now this was actually a build that was suggested to me
1876380	1883980	and we did some modifications to it. Apparently my resident Pigou build is loved.
1885740	1891100	I was watching when you had Nick and Prince play your build on his stream. That was fun. Yeah.
1892060	1897420	Isn't it evil? It is just the whole concept of, yeah. Anyway, I don't want to,
1897420	1899980	we talk about too much Dead by Daylight on the show. I'm not going to get it.
1902380	1910300	Bourbon played it today. Oh, okay. And we switched out a corrupt intervention for Lethal Pursuer.
1911820	1917180	And it was pretty vicious. So I'm going to have to take that and incorporate it into the official
1917180	1922780	resident Pigou. All right. So anyway, and if anyone who's playing wants to know what resident
1922780	1927180	Pigou is, let me know. But it's called that because it relies on playing the Raccoon Police
1927180	1932860	Department, AKA RuPaul's Drag Station. Or just watch Dark Soccer's stream on Twitch.
1934860	1941420	I've been trying to get a number two rule set and have it or a tamper timer. No luck.
1942380	1948780	So I'm going back to leveling Pyramid Daddy with his nerfed butt.
1952700	1957820	Does he have any less power now that his butt's flatter? No, it's a graphical thing.
1957820	1962460	Freddy. Yeah, Freddy's power got nerfed in it, but it's not that bad. It's not that bad. It's not
1962460	1967820	that bad. No, a lot of people just start playing him randomly and I'm like, okay, more Freddy for
1967820	1972460	me. I'm still playing. I'm still playing it exactly the same way. I was playing pre-nerf,
1972460	1977820	so it's no big, you know. It's gonna be really awkward if they ever add Five Nights at Freddy's
1977820	1982300	characters with Freddy. It's just gonna be confusing. Well, we're technically going to have
1982300	1989260	two pee pee heads because there's Pinhead coming in now. Yeah. But he's cool. Oh my God. I can't
1989260	1994060	wait for it to go live and to see if they fix the problems that there were during PTB. Yeah,
1994460	1998300	I will say I hope Pinhead is in the game around the time I get back from Dragon Con. I don't know
1998300	2002060	how much longer it's going to take to- You opened the box and I came.
2002060	2007420	Yeah, that's the first, well, I guess Trickster had it, but that's the first killer that has,
2008060	2014380	you know, such menacing sentences. Trickster's vocals are very like, you know, ha ha ha ha ha.
2015100	2018540	They got a Korean voice actor for him. Yeah, he has little things, but-
2019100	2024780	Keep in mind, Adiris had lines. Oh, that's right.
2024780	2027260	They weren't in English. That's right. No, you're right.
2027260	2034700	But she spoke, it wasn't actually Babylonian. It's like one of the other derivative languages
2034700	2041740	though of that timeframe. I want to say it was like, I'll look it up later, but it was,
2041740	2045340	it was a derivative. Yeah, anyway, they did research into her, which I thought was really
2045340	2055900	cool. But from that too, I was also playing word skates because I love my word games and
2058300	2066940	I actually got Gardic on stream for me to try to incorporate later. So we'll see if that happens.
2066940	2071100	It's so much fun though. I love it. So I have to, you know, get my tablet stuff together.
2071100	2077260	All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week. My gaming week. Oh, yeah.
2078140	2085660	We did a pinball trade, so we now have a Rick and Morty as a temporary. Dan traded Metallica
2085660	2091660	temporarily for us to have the Rick and Morty in our garage. So you want to come play it.
2091660	2098620	I kind of do, because I don't know the Rick and Morty table at all. So I was going to play it the
2098620	2102140	other day, but you know, I've been getting over this Sinus infection. I'm mostly over it now.
2102140	2108940	Yeah. So my gaming week, I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight. I did a stream
2108940	2114620	one night this week randomly, and that was a lot of fun. And I've also been playing like,
2114620	2118780	just a lot of the like stuff I've talked about on the show before, you know, Final Fantasy 14,
2118780	2122460	but then I also kind of dipped into some other stuff. I randomly started playing No Man's Sky
2122460	2127180	and I got an achievement that I hadn't unlocked yet. I was trying to basically get back to the
2127180	2132540	center of the galaxy again, or no, I was trying to finish the Atlas storyline, which I thought
2132540	2138220	would trigger the center of the galaxy story again, because I thought you also kind of did
2138220	2142860	the same thing, but it didn't play out the way I thought it would. You kind of just get an item
2142860	2147340	that instantly like shows you where tons of black holes are. So that's kind of fun. I mean, spoiler
2147340	2151420	alert, but not really. No Man's Sky is a five-year-old game at this point. I think part
2151420	2156700	of me is also just anticipating that new patch. And I think I do want a platinum No Man's Sky,
2157340	2161340	but I'm playing on Xbox. It's not really platinum, but you know what I mean? The hardest achievement
2161340	2166140	is going to be that permadeath one because permadeath mode isn't just, you know, permadeath,
2166140	2173180	but it's like a higher, like the resources cost more, things drain faster. Like it's going to be
2173180	2178540	a rough grind to get that one, but I kind of want to try it. So we'll see, but I'm really awaiting
2178540	2182300	whatever the, you know, there's been, we talked about on a previous episode, there's been teases
2182540	2189820	of another, you know, big content patch for that game. And I'm hoping another seasonal event will
2189820	2193900	come with that sort of like the Mass Effect thing, but it doesn't have to be a tie in with
2193900	2197740	anything else. Like I enjoyed the first event for what it was. So I'm hoping there's another
2197740	2201980	one that comes in pretty soon in that game. That would be fun. And then I played Katamari Damacy
2201980	2207180	Reroll because that is on Game Pass now. So if you have Xbox, Microsoft, whatever you can play
2207180	2211660	Katamari Damacy Reroll and that game is still, that's the game is still a joy all these years
2211660	2215100	later. Cause if you think about it, that's based off the original Katamari game, which was out
2216140	2222460	around the time this show started a long time ago. So it's, it's a delight to play again and
2222460	2227900	just experience that that's for sure. So that was pretty much my gaming week. So let's move on.
2229340	2233260	I will mention quickly before we get into the rest of the news from this week,
2233260	2238620	just some quick housekeeping things. There will not be a live show or a podcast next week,
2238620	2241340	which is very, you know, if you've been listening to the show for a while,
2241340	2246060	it's kind of been that way over Labor Day weekend because I'm going to be out of town.
2246060	2249740	I'm going to be at Dragon Con. I hope I get to meet a lot of people at Dragon Con,
2249740	2253900	but at the same time, it's going to be a very different kind of year where I'm really focusing
2253900	2260540	on panels and not so much parties, just because obviously with all the stuff going on out there,
2261100	2264220	I want to take things a little bit cautiously, although I was very,
2264220	2270060	very happy to hear in the past week, week and a half, Dragon Con kind of made the same move
2270060	2275580	that PAX ended up making. And that is they will be mandating. You have to have either the vaccine
2275580	2282060	or a negative test in the last 72 hours, whatever. So that's on top of the mask mandate. So that's
2282060	2286940	makes me feel a lot better, but I'm going to, I'm going to really enjoy the panels. I am on
2287580	2291980	six different panels this year. I gave an overview of those last week, so I'm not going to detail all
2291980	2296220	six of them again tonight. I'll just point you over at my Twitter, twitter.com slash Mr. Rob
2296220	2301020	Roberts, that's MR Rob Roberts. And all of my panels are listed there in the pin post. I made
2301020	2306300	it my pin post for now. I will point out three of those panels are online. So if you are doing
2306300	2312380	virtual Dragon Con this year, which many people are, you can check out those three, three of those
2312380	2316620	six panels I'm going to be doing are going to be streamed online. So I hope to see some of you guys
2316620	2322860	there. Two of them are on Friday. I have, it's, I have like eight hours of panels on Friday.
2323660	2328540	Which is, I mean, no, no, I overstated that, but it's, it's a lot. It's an hour and a half,
2329180	2333340	no, an hour panel and then a half hour break. So it's six hours of panels because it's four
2333340	2337660	back to back to back, but it'll be fine. I love doing panels. It's my favorite part of the show.
2337660	2342860	So I'm very excited to do that and hopefully meet some people at Dragon Con this year,
2343740	2351420	either virtually or in person. Okay. That's it for that. We will see you in two weeks
2352140	2357020	live. So we will not be here next week. I imagine Dark Sakura will be here on Sunday
2357020	2361580	streaming probably, but I don't know. I don't want to, maybe she'll go out and enjoy. I don't know.
2361580	2365980	Maybe you'll go out and enjoy the night. I don't know. Maybe I'll do a marathon. Yeah,
2365980	2370380	there you go. Bobby won't be here either that night for obvious reasons. He does the same
2370380	2375100	thing that I'm doing. So Sunday night is going to be open. So there you go.
2376780	2382780	Also, although I don't think any of our regulars are in the area, I do just want to acknowledge
2382780	2388380	that, that hurricane that's happening in Louisiana right now and the surrounding area. I just, you
2388380	2393420	know, want to say, I hope everybody is safe and got out of the path of that storm and was able
2393420	2399580	to evacuate and definitely sending my thoughts to those that are affected by that. Cause that does
2399580	2404540	not sound like a lot of fun right now. So, um, yeah, just, uh, wanted to acknowledge that and
2404540	2411180	hope that all of our listener fam is, uh, in a drier place right now. Okay. Uh, let's get into
2411180	2416780	some other gaming news. Loki. We'll start with you. Starting that news with what I played this
2416780	2422620	week. Uh, did I skip you completely? I sure did. I'm sorry, Loki. What did you play? It's just,
2422620	2425980	it's just Minecraft. I know I was gonna say, what did you play anything besides Minecraft?
2426780	2431340	Uh, you have your own Christian Minecraft server now. I don't have my own Christian
2431340	2435820	Minecraft server. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to skip you, Logan. Oh, that's all good. Um,
2435820	2440620	no, I was mainly Minecraft. So like I meant to put out a video this week and then I realized
2440620	2445340	that we have our road contest thing, which is technically it was due like yesterday, but
2445980	2450380	you know, the people there are judging it. They're on vacation, so it's fine. So I've been like
2451020	2458540	working in that for a long time. So yeah, still feeling the pressure to put out a video and I
2458540	2464700	have a lot of content for that. Just had priorities. So, um, anyways, so one thing I
2464700	2470620	definitely would have seen going to be playing this week is the fan made Metroid prime 2d project.
2471260	2479900	And, um, you know, it was this awesome work by a team, uh, SCU that released the demo for prime
2479900	2485420	2d. It was a side scrolling remake of Metroid prime that they've been working on it for 15
2485420	2489340	years. You already know the punchline to this. It's a Nintendo game. So of course,
2489340	2496300	Nintendo was going to put an end to that and they did. They, um, cease and desisted it and it's
2496300	2506460	buh-bye. Um, so yeah, so they put out a, um, a post in Reddit saying, hello, dedicated fans.
2506460	2511900	It's an announcement that you've been dreading. We have been asked by certain games related company
2511900	2518380	to discontinue our work on prime 2d in its current form. We have removed the demo download and
2518380	2522540	soundtrack MP3 download. We are currently in dialogue with that company in terms of
2523340	2529260	they're not going to undo it. I mean, come on. Um, so yeah, this is what happens when you talk
2529260	2533660	about your game before your games. I just have to make it. And I know you're really excited about it.
2533660	2539580	You really want to share, you know, the work you got to understand they're going to C and D that
2539580	2545740	so fast that it's just, I mean, come on, you've been working out for 15 years now or planning,
2545740	2552300	I'm sorry, planning for 15 years on it. You kind of knew what was going to happen.
2552620	2557900	I mean, they've only done it to everything. You, you have to do what they call in the music
2557900	2563580	industry, a Beyonce, if you might remember Beyonce just dropped an album with no warning,
2563580	2568700	no lead up, no hype, no nothing. Um, she was really, I don't know. She was the first artist
2568700	2573020	ever to do it. She's certainly the first that I think of. And, you know, certainly the digital
2573020	2577340	era, I think kind of changed a lot of the rules. Um, you know, you just, just put it out there
2577340	2582860	and it's done. And so I think, uh, that's what a lot of these fan projects that are in questionable
2582860	2587660	territory have to do if they want to actually see a release is they just have to Beyonce it,
2587660	2593740	uh, and just drop it. Um, not, and again, I get that it's a legal gray area and especially with
2593740	2599820	a Metroid game coming out next month, Nintendo is going to protect their trademarks and they,
2599820	2605340	they do this aggressively. This should not be a surprise to anybody. Does it suck? Yes. But at
2605340	2611820	the same time, should it surprise you? Absolutely not. Um, we can only hope for at this point that
2611820	2617660	they will be able to redo some of the sprites and some of the things to make it, uh, you know,
2617660	2627100	matroid supper matroid. And you want to contrast this with what like Sega is doing. Sega just had
2627100	2632060	a fan game festival for Sonic. So they were showing off a ton of fan games that were made
2632060	2636220	with that. Just different companies, different, you know, philosophies about it, but like
2637020	2640060	Kano wish Nintendo would just take the Sega philosophy, you know,
2641100	2647740	Sega does what intend don't. And that's not finally allowing fan games to exist. Yeah.
2649500	2653900	All right. Um, let's move on. This is, this next story has had a lot of people talking this week,
2653900	2658620	especially on social media. Um, you know, and just a couple of weeks on ago on the show,
2658620	2664300	we were talking about the Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite and how, um, it was very unique and it
2664300	2670460	really had people thinking about Fortnite as an artistic platform and as, you know, oh, maybe for,
2670460	2674300	you know, and, and if you've looked in some of the things that, you know, Epic and they've all
2674300	2679020	said about Fortnite in the past is that they want Fortnite to be this, you know, not just
2679660	2685820	their battle royale game, but they want it to be basically a pop culture, you know, puddle. Um,
2685820	2690620	so that makes this, this interest, this latest development from this week, very fascinating.
2690620	2698540	Um, and that is that time magazine helped craft an interactive exhibit called March through time.
2698540	2707340	It is a, uh, uh, interactive experience all about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Uh, and, uh, I have not,
2707340	2711660	I don't have Fortnite even installed on my computer, so I haven't been able to experience
2711660	2719100	it myself. Um, but I am told that you will, uh, transport to DC 1963, which is a re-imagined
2719100	2724380	version of the nation's Capitol that allows you to visit, um, exhibits that are kind of like a
2724380	2729900	virtual museum. Uh, they actually kind of explain what Dr. King's speech is all about, uh, talks
2729900	2735180	about the, the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. Uh, and I believe you can actually, um,
2735740	2742460	uh, hear the entire I have a dream speech in there. Um, and you earn a special spray that you
2742460	2747100	can use in your Fortnite matches from going through the experience, perhaps to entice people
2747100	2754060	to go to it. Um, and this has gotten a lot of feedback because there's been a lot of things
2754060	2760860	from like what to, hey, Fortnite's trying to do a good thing and, and bring education to the
2761740	2769500	children, to these very interesting pictures of, let's say the Xenomorph from Alien, who is a
2769500	2776300	playable character in Fortnite walking around Washington, DC, 1963 with Rick from Rick and
2776300	2782220	Morty. Um, and this experience has already had some issues too, is that they had to disable emotes,
2782220	2789660	uh, from outside, I guess the experience brings eight unique emotes. Um, so you can use those
2789660	2794700	unique ones in the experience, but you can't bring the outside ones in anymore because people
2794700	2800460	were doing things that were inappropriate. And it's a lot of the, um, optics that are causing
2800460	2806780	some people to take issue with, like, for example, the loading screen will give you a tip for how to
2806780	2812940	play Fortnite Battle Royale, which might involve like how to properly use the gun, which is a
2812940	2819420	little bit tasteless when you consider the end of the story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's
2819420	2825260	pretty tasteless. So some of those optics don't play out too well. Um, I don't know. I, I don't
2825260	2831260	know. I, I feel like I want to experience it for myself before I really form an opinion, but I do
2831260	2837740	kind of feel like it's extremely well-intentioned. It's, and I saw a very, I saw a very interesting
2837740	2841500	comment that I thought is worth repeating, and I'm very sorry. I don't know who said the comment.
2841500	2846780	It's one of those things I picked up on Twitch, or I'm sorry, not Twitch, Twitter, the other TW,
2846780	2852940	um, on, and somebody had said, you know what? If they're gonna not teach critical race theory
2852940	2857660	in schools and people have to learn about critical, you know, that type of stuff through Fortnite,
2857660	2863340	that's wild, but I'm glad they're doing it type of thing. And it did kind of stop and give me pause.
2863340	2866940	I was like, cause you know, I'd seen a lot of the negative blowback on the experience,
2866940	2871740	but when I saw that comment, I was like, fuck, this person has a point. When you consider what
2871740	2878540	Fortnite's target audience really is, which is kids around Loki's age. I don't know if it's
2878540	2881660	really a bad thing that they get to- I hope kids are not my age.
2881660	2886780	Sorry, sorry. You know what I mean? The kids that are Loki's kids age.
2887340	2895580	Hey, fellow kids. Um, I actually, I kind of like, you know what? I, I think it's pretty well
2895580	2903580	intact. I think, I think there's a lot of like optic issues and like learning curve types of
2903580	2910780	things that maybe this isn't where I would have started and maybe learned about some of those
2910780	2917100	things by maybe, but at the same time, again, it's, it's hard to be upset about it, but I do
2917100	2922460	think there's a lot of feedback that Epic and the Fortnite team could certainly hear about it.
2922460	2926780	I don't know. What do you guys think? I don't know. Has anybody played it at all or what do
2926780	2934700	you think? Well, I don't play Fortnite. No. But I think honestly, though, well-intentioned is a very
2934700	2939740	apt description for something like this. And I think it could be positive, especially given,
2939740	2950940	again, that we've got these states that are rolling back education about such an important
2950940	2958700	part of American history. But I think that, that it's not enough, that it's just one focus.
2959900	2970220	Um, I, it, it will, it will be, I think, helpful and bring some attention, but I think that we
2970220	2979740	need broader education out there and accurate representation. Um, not black and white photos,
2979740	2983900	but photos that were taken in color in the sixties, because it wasn't that long ago.
2984700	2989980	Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says apparently kids have reactive really positively towards this and
2989980	2994940	they have actually shocked their gamer parents. And that is a good point. I think is that it can
2994940	3002860	start a conversation that I think is a good conversation to have. Um, and I don't know what
3002860	3007500	else to say. I think, I think, I think there are, again, there's, there's many good things about
3007500	3012700	this. I just think that the putting it in Fortnite and it's almost like you're, you're,
3012700	3017020	you're kind of like jumping like five steps ahead to this thing that it's like, this is,
3017020	3021660	this is very good. This is very important and we're glad it's here now, but maybe there would
3021660	3027420	have been some learning steps along the way before we got here, but it's, it's hard to look at this
3027420	3034380	and go. It's terrible. I think it's, it's just, I think so many of us were unprepared for Fortnite
3034380	3043660	to bring this. So it's interesting. Um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat. I wanted to say
3043660	3048860	here, um, DJ Rama S in chat says, got to educate these youngins one way or another.
3049420	3056620	Uh, Mike Deft in chat says, it's like, it's a nice gesture, but this ain't it chief. Um, yeah. Uh,
3056620	3061340	and then, uh, move, moves on to a reply to Bobby saying, if the end of all of this is positive,
3061340	3066620	then I'm all for it. Even if I don't agree with how it's done entirely. Um, Quest Buster brings
3066620	3073820	up an interesting kind of like, um, analogy, I guess, uh, is, uh, with Ubisoft's, uh, relatively
3073820	3078780	recent Assassin's Creed titles have tried to do with their history walkthroughs of ancient Egypt
3078780	3084220	and Greece, that they can use games to at least spark a sense of discovery instead of simply being
3084220	3090540	games. Excuse me. You know, I thought of that too, actually. And I thought about also a game like
3090540	3097100	civilization and how much I learned from really loving that game when I was in high school.
3097100	3101340	And even though that wasn't an edutainment game, it wasn't the Oregon trail. It wasn't
3101340	3106940	Carmen San Diego. I certainly learned a lot about some of the natural wonders of the world or the,
3106940	3110140	you know, manmade ones as well. Some of the wonders of the world, if you will,
3110140	3113900	through that game, you learn about leaders of the world and their different styles,
3113900	3118860	except they kind of messed up Gandhi. And if you know civilization, you, you get the joke there.
3118860	3127100	If you don't look it up, uh, Gandhi was, he was problematic. Yes. Um, but anyway, there was,
3127100	3134620	there was, um, anyway, there's a lot I learned from playing civilization, um, that, uh, I,
3134620	3139820	I wouldn't have gotten if not the fact that I really enjoyed the game. So it's, I don't know.
3141820	3146780	I, uh, I, I was tempted to download Fortnite just to check this out. It's just one of those things
3146780	3153260	where I don't have the bandwidth to download a 60 gig game right now. Um, but I, I really should
3153260	3156940	have sat down and watched at least a YouTube or somebody playing through it on Twitch. I'd like
3156940	3163820	to sort of see it for myself, um, to get more out of it. Um, but I, again, I think it's a very,
3163820	3168940	I think it's going to start a bigger conversation. Um, and I think this whole idea of educating
3168940	3174380	people through video games is generally a great direction for the industry. And I think we just
3174380	3179100	have to figure out what's the magic formula to really make that work so that we don't have,
3179100	3184140	you know, offensive emotes coming from the, the xenomorph and the aliens, you know,
3184140	3188700	trying to look through the exhibit or what have you. So. I don't think it's necessarily that it
3188700	3194540	was like offensive in the sense that the emotes were offensive. I think it's more of like,
3194540	3199340	you know, maybe we shouldn't be like doing the Carlton while Martin Luther King's giving his
3199340	3204860	speech. I think it was more of that, like, this is not the time for that. Right. Um,
3206860	3213100	our man with the voiceovers VX chase next V in chat says learning through concepts is one thing
3213100	3217820	learning through interactive concepts is another. And yes, I agree with that. I think, and again,
3217820	3220860	you know, kind of going back to what Bobby is saying is that this is, this is starting
3220860	3227260	conversations. I th I think this is a good thing. We just have to figure out how do, how do we
3227260	3232140	make sure it's right and that we don't have people doing the Carlton, you know, when people,
3232140	3236380	you know, and, and those sorts of things. Cause unfortunately on the internet, things are going
3236380	3241740	to, maybe this should have been something that was like explored as a single player or in a party
3241740	3246700	with friends only type of thing. Um, I don't know. I, I'm not, I'm not saying definitively that
3246700	3249980	should have been it. I'm just saying maybe there's some other things we have to kind of figure out
3249980	3255660	about how to get all that to work. So anyway, I'm sure we will hear more on this and other
3255660	3262700	similar things as Fortnite dips into the, um, the edge, the education for the children as well.
3262700	3268140	I'm also curious, Loki, if your kid, maybe your kids are a little bit too young, but well, I don't
3268140	3273020	know. I don't know, but I'd be curious to see if they end up in this and what they get out of it.
3273020	3278940	I'd be very curious about that. Oh, they don't play Fortnite. So I thought they did. Oh, it's
3278940	3285020	Roblox. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless, unless they're, they're doing a Martin Luther King thing and
3285020	3291420	wacky wizards or in, uh, Brookhaven, I don't think it's going to happen. Well, it'll be
3291420	3295820	interesting to see what the industry kind of looks at this and does. And I honestly, I mean,
3295820	3299660	let's be real. Fortnite has ripped off from everything else. Let's just, let's just spill
3299660	3305740	the tea. Everything in Fortnite was ripped off of someone else. And honestly what Questbuster was
3305740	3310220	explaining about that Assassin's Creed. Hmm. Where do you think, where do you think they may have
3310220	3318620	gotten the inspiration? I'm allegedly, supposedly, maybe hypothesis planning is completely
3318620	3323260	historically accurate nowadays, you know, with its Pegasus and Norths gods and all that stuff.
3323260	3327500	Well, but they, they do have those educational modes that, you know, bring a little more to it,
3327500	3333580	not the actual game part anyway. All right. Does it talk about the, uh, the harboring of sex
3333580	3337580	abusers and Ubisoft as well? Is that part of the education I'm also going to be getting from this?
3337580	3342780	You know, I think they omitted that part. Uh, that's, that's something they got to rely on the,
3342780	3348700	the community to remind people of is that there are still many problems with the industry. Uh,
3348700	3353020	but I think we come to some of those a little later in the show. So I will, uh, get to that
3353020	3359260	later. Uh, in the meantime, how about a nice, how about a nice story that takes Orange Lounge Radio
3359260	3364540	back to its roots? Let's go to Dark Sakura for its next story. These roots are kind of grown out,
3364540	3369660	aren't they? A little bit. These roots give me a heart attack these days, but I think it's neat.
3370380	3381660	Oh, Rob. Um, so, well, long gone are the days of Mr. Spanky and Betty. Um, there is a new
3381660	3390460	dance dance revolution, uh, PC coming out. Um, and I'm actually looking at the tweet here,
3391260	3397100	uh, that came out with this one and hold on, let me, let me see if I can take a better look
3397100	3405500	at the tweet. Uh, notice of the version of dance dance revolution, second open alpha test
3405500	3412540	for a limited time will be holding the it's it's translated as Konaste,
3413660	3419180	um, version of dance, dance revolution, second open alpha test. Please take this opportunity
3419180	3427020	to try it. Um, from what I can at least tell from what the tweet says it is in Japanese and I'm
3427020	3436300	kind of half reading it. Um, Oh, good. They translated it. Uh, anyway. Um, so Konami has
3436300	3444940	ended the alpha test for, uh, DDR V five, I guess it is an HTML five browser version of DDR and
3445020	3450860	renewed the game with a second open alpha test. Uh, so DDR, uh, dancers revolution PC for the
3450860	3457580	Konami amusement game station. So that's Konaste. That's where that came from. Also known as EA
3457580	3464620	cloud or maybe alpha, I guess. Um, but it's going to run from August 24th, 2021 through September
3464620	3473340	six, 2021. Um, it is very similar to the arcade version, DDR a 20 plus, and I was surprised
3473340	3478780	because I didn't even realize there was a plus version of that game. Yep. There is. It only has
3478780	3485260	a few songs in it and, um, no safe feature. Um, but the dance pad is up on Konami style and
3485260	3490860	dance pad look nice. I gotta say they look very different now, but in true Konami style fashion,
3490860	3494140	though, you, they have to get a thousand pre-orders in order to actually make it.
3494140	3500860	As I was saying, I may have already, uh, told the husband I'm pre-ordering one. Oh, good for you.
3501500	3514220	Um, the price of it right now is 17,380 yen. So roughly about 170 bucks really isn't that
3514220	3519020	bad considering, um, is it a hard pad or is it, I mean, it looked like one of those like
3519020	3523660	cheapy soft pads. I mean, I don't know. It looked like it might be the foamy kind.
3523660	3534380	That's kind of, hold on a second. I was to say it might be the price might make more sense if it's
3534380	3539980	one of the foamy type of things. Like, uh, you remember towards, I want to say the end of when
3539980	3543660	we were all playing DDR, but it was around that time they had, I think red octane or one of those
3543660	3553500	companies put out foam, uh, some comments to chat, uh, Jason in chat says EA cloud is EMU's cloud.
3554220	3557980	Orange, right. It says the pad is way overpriced. If it's a regular soft mat. I agree.
3557980	3563260	Darted says it has a free mode, but it locks you to pre DDR stuff. Maybe they don't want you to
3563260	3569500	play all the arcade stuff for free. Um, you know, and that's also in like, this coming out also
3569500	3574540	doesn't surprise me when we've had a B-Mania 2DX we've had a, you know, we've had other
3574540	3580940	Bimani games that Konami has looked at putting on PC anyway. Sorry. So I have, I have more USB
3580940	3585180	connection, Bluetooth, low energy compatible, no compatible service at this time, body weight
3585180	3594220	approx a size 983 millimeters by 840 millimeters body weight, 1.4 kilogram USB cable, not included
3594220	3601820	corresponding service PC version, connoisse, dance dance revolution, uh, has a music pack comes with
3601820	3609260	it. Uh, purchase benefits will be reserved to their Konami ID. So there's a lot to your Konami
3609260	3616700	ID. Um, bonus songs will look like also be going through Konami ID, um, number of units,
3616700	3623260	a thousand units order acceptance period, August 24th through September 6th. Just reading the,
3623980	3632860	I just ran it through, um, a translator. Nice. I'll, I'll wait, you know, until they crack it
3632860	3639660	to allow me to play whatever songs I want and it will happen immediately. So true. I can't wait.
3640860	3649100	Um, so as far as other, uh, things to go with this system requirements are, um, uh, Windows 10 64
3649100	3655660	bit, um, at least 2.8 gigahertz processor recommended Intel core I five or higher AMD
3655980	3664700	eight at 3.5 gigahertz or higher, uh, 40 gigabytes of hard drive space of recommended
3664700	3671420	Ram eight gigabytes, uh, video Ram one gigabyte or higher. I mean, that makes sense if it's going
3671420	3679740	to be playing music and graphics, I mean, you'll, you'll need it. So, um, direct X nine, uh, C or
3679740	3686620	higher stereo on board sound recommended resolution 1280 by seven 20 at 60 kilohertz.
3687580	3691100	The arcade hardware. I mean, that's basically kind of what they're talking about there,
3691100	3695180	because that's, I think what the arcade machines run and they run on PCs anyway.
3695980	3699660	Are you saying they just repurpose the arcade software for a home version? You've got,
3699660	3706940	well, I finished the story. All right. All right. Okay. Um, so the songs that are included right
3706940	3713260	now is make it better. Keep on moving, drop the bomb higher, broken my heart. Oh,
3713260	3724220	Polteri comes back exotic ethnic destiny. Xenon Astra gazer, uh, digital love Helios level up
3725020	3734220	hyper bomb in the past splash gold. And one more thing, hold on. Cause I have to translate it.
3737260	3741820	I don't read that much kanji. Um, one way ticket to space.
3749500	3758780	So looking at the product page, it is a soft mat and it's wireless Bluetooth though as well,
3758780	3765740	but for a soft mat, no, no, no, no, no $100. Even if it's wireless, I don't care if it's
3766380	3771580	like there's toys, they're wireless. Like it doesn't cost $100 to put a Bluetooth module
3771580	3778940	into their thing that that is vastly overpriced. Um, although like I do show them folding it up,
3778940	3785980	like you can fold it down, but like maybe there's maybe technology has advanced further than the
3785980	3794460	soft pads of lore. Um, but I, I don't know. Like it just, it looks cheap. Definitely not
3794460	3799340	something I'd buy for a hundred dollars. All right. But I definitely want to check
3799340	3804380	out the game at some point. That's for sure. Yeah. All right. Check out the game.
3804380	3809100	Yeah. Anything else on to report on DDR PC Darsagra? Apparently not.
3809820	3812540	All right. Let's move on to our next story. Loki.
3813580	3818220	Yeah. So halo infinite was something that they also were talking about during, um,
3818220	3825180	games com the opening night live. So they talked, well, first the release date for halo infinite
3825180	3830060	leaked out and then it was confirmed to be true. So it is going to be coming out December 8th.
3830700	3838300	And, uh, along with that, they're going to be having some brand new, uh, um, limited edition
3838300	3843980	consoles and whatnot. So they're going to have a, an Xbox series X that's going to launch, um,
3844780	3852060	on November 15th. And then, um, looks like we also have the elite series two controller,
3852060	3856620	which launches November 15th. Maybe I was wrong on that date. I think that was, was it November
3856620	3861660	15th for the game actually? Yeah. November 15th for the game as well. Um, I'm saying why I think
3861660	3867500	December 8th, that's weird. Um, anyways, so those are going to be coming. I like the controller,
3867500	3873100	the leak controller, not buying it for $200, but it looks nice. I mean, and that, uh, the series
3873100	3879020	X looks nice. Um, I, I like the con I like the controller with that console. I would buy that
3879020	3888780	separately. Um, but I already have an Xbox series X, so scan it, I guess. I don't know. Um,
3890300	3895420	oh yeah, no, I'm sorry. So yeah, the console's coming out November 15th game is coming out
3895420	3901820	December 8th. I knew I didn't forget that. Um, the limited edition Xbox series X,
3901820	3908780	550 bucks. And then the elite series controller, $200 vastly overpriced if you ask me, but
3911020	3915900	I mean, it's, it's, it's a controller. It looks the master chief.
3916860	3920860	And this, the system is so, so good looking. I really want one.
3921420	3927340	Yeah, the system looks nice. Um, yeah. And then they didn't really show too much. They
3927340	3935420	have like a cinematic trailer for like, um, I guess the multiplayer. I don't really know
3935420	3939580	what exactly was, that was all about. It kind of didn't make any sense to me, but,
3940780	3945180	you know, glad to know that there's that it's coming soon, the release of that.
3945180	3950300	And they were able to get their act together pretty fast, but yeah, we'll have to wait and
3950300	3954380	see. I'm sure we'll hear more about it as soon as we get closer to that date.
3954380	3960060	E3 VL in chat says, uh, over twitch.tv slash vog network says I heard launch content for the game.
3960060	3964300	Isn't that great? Yeah. It seems like they're going to really be kind of adding a lot to it
3964300	3969420	as it goes. The co-op is not going to be there at launch, which is kind of weird.
3969420	3973100	Which would usually be very obnoxious. Um, and I think the folks that are paying the
3973100	3978060	full $60 price tag may have some reservations with that, but we also have to remember Microsoft
3978060	3982940	is really all in on game pass at this point. And I think, you know, if they can still get a lot of
3982940	3987260	people to check the game out on game pass in a way that's still a win for them. And I think there will
3987260	3991020	be a lot of people that will check out, even if it's just kind of like partial halo, I'll be one
3991020	3998700	of them. I enjoy halo enough to check out on game pass. Um, whatever, whatever parts of the game are
3998700	4004620	there, uh, the day that it launches. So it's just interesting to kind of think about. Yeah,
4004620	4008700	the whole game's not really there, but when you think about Microsoft's overall strategy,
4008700	4013420	is it that surprising? I mean, I think we all know the development of the game plays that we have
4013420	4018540	right now. Yeah. Cause like every game nowadays has a roadmap for it. I mean, it's becoming more
4018540	4025980	acceptable, unfortunately. Um, but I mean, I kind of, I trust that Microsoft will put out a decent
4025980	4029740	game. I mean, they, they kind of know what they're doing three for three knows what they're doing
4029740	4036540	with, um, these games. So we'll have to wait and see. All right. I'm not getting a day one anyways.
4036540	4040780	So, I mean, I guess I can play it on games pass. So in a sense that we'll be getting a day one,
4040780	4046700	but yeah. All right. Well, moving on to our next story. So, um, on a prior episode of the show,
4046700	4050620	dark soccer and I were bantering a little bit about the, um, stranger things content being
4050620	4055660	removed from dead by daylight, uh, in November. And, uh, certainly a lot of speculation as to
4055660	4061180	the reasons why it was going away led to the fact that, Oh, Netflix is doing, we know that Netflix
4061180	4065740	is planning their own, uh, gaming service and stranger things probably ties into that. And then
4065740	4071740	there was even more fuel on the fire. Uh, when I had noticed that on games pass, uh, the stranger
4071740	4078700	things three RPG was set to leave the service on September 1st. And as it turns out, there is
4078700	4083820	something going on with stranger things and Netflix gaming. Um, and a lot of it went down
4083820	4088620	in Poland, uh, believe it or not because that is Netflix is basically their testing region for
4088620	4095100	this. So what happened in Poland? Um, well, starting this week, uh, Netflix members in Poland
4095100	4101420	are able to try Netflix mobile gaming. Um, it's only on Android, uh, for their test for whatever
4101420	4109100	reason. Um, and there's two games for it. Stranger things, 1984 and stranger things three, uh,
4109100	4112780	stranger things three, of course, is that RPG. I think if I remember right, stranger things,
4112780	4121660	1984 is a not great puzzle game. Um, but it's, it's, uh, it's part of the stranger things,
4121660	4125740	you know, licenses or whatever. So these are the two games that are a part of the test.
4125740	4130780	So if you're a Netflix member in Poland, you can check these out on your Android device as part of
4130780	4136620	the membership. Uh, Netflix did say, uh, it's still very, very early days and we will be working
4136620	4141660	hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app
4141660	4147100	purchases approach to gaming. Interesting that they also emphasize those points. Um,
4148220	4154300	just as the infrastructure to do that. So, you know, well, we'll brag about it as a positive
4154300	4159500	justice and FYI, you do not stream these games through the cloud. That's not what this does.
4159500	4165020	And this probably is may explain why it isn't currently testing on the Apple side of things.
4165020	4169180	I would guess I don't, I don't, I can only really speculate there. It's not through cloud gaming.
4169180	4174620	What you do when you installed now, uh, you go to the Google play store cause it's Android and
4174620	4179340	you download the game on the device. Uh, you can also download the game directly from the play
4179340	4184540	store, but you have to use your Netflix login as your credentials. So you can then play the games
4184540	4190300	through the Netflix app or their own dedicated app. Hmm. Now they, now Netflix does say an iOS
4190300	4195820	test is coming. So that is, you know, they're not leaving it out. Uh, and then, um, yeah. So,
4195820	4200220	but then we don't know exactly how that will work. Uh, yet if it downloads to the app store,
4200220	4206540	what we'll find out more when the test gets there. Um, but Netflix is using stranger things as part
4206540	4212460	of their gaming service test. So not, um, a terrible, terrible, big surprise when we talk
4212460	4218380	about some of the content shifting around. I still don't think they needed to do it. Um,
4219020	4223580	like you kind of said earlier, Sonic shows up in all these fan things and,
4223580	4227580	you know, it's Mario and Sonic at the Olympics. And I don't think it hurts
4227580	4232780	sales or brand identity that move or that movie still did very, very well when it came out.
4232780	4238380	So, um, I'm not sure I see the logic as to why they need to remove stranger things from dead
4238380	4243980	by daylight, other than. They just don't want to, it's not worth it to them or whatever. It's,
4243980	4247260	it's a little weird, but I guess they're within their rights.
4247260	4250700	Well, they're, they're also not really that like sought out of, you know, to,
4251340	4255260	I'm not like seeking it out to play. And they're also available. Like I think
4255260	4259020	some of that's already on like the steam storefront or Epic games and stuff like that.
4259020	4264540	So it's, it's other places like, I'm not gonna be like, Oh my God, it's gone from games path.
4264540	4269900	I better go check this out in Netflix. No one's thinking that at all. So whatever,
4269900	4275580	not these games, but it'll be interesting if Netflix comes up with originals and who knows,
4275580	4281260	maybe they have their own dead by daylight clone kind of game. We'll say, uh, uh, we'll say, um,
4281260	4287820	lopsided four V one kind of game that maybe we'll use the, then it'll make more sense to me why they
4287820	4292700	wanted to pull back from dead by daylight. Even though, again, if you bought those characters,
4292700	4296460	you keep those care, you're going to still see those characters in dead by daylight.
4296460	4300700	I wonder if they'll be like for the record, it's just stranger things stuff.
4300700	4307340	What's that Jamie? For the record. I think that the DLC cosmetics are the vector cosmetics
4307340	4314460	are going off sale before like a few days before the whole thing actually is gone.
4314460	4322300	Yep. Um, as to show 100, Matt, why you can. SSU 100, Matt, with a good perspective here saying
4322300	4327900	Netflix survived by taking a chance on streaming and making their own content. That is true.
4327900	4332380	Um, you know, Netflix really started the ball with making their own stuff. Like when
4332380	4336220	orange is the new black, I think was one of the first shows that I can remember being a Netflix
4336220	4340940	original. And there was a huge fucking deal when that came out that, and, uh, the one that
4340940	4346220	unfortunately had Kevin Spacey and that whole mess tank, that whole show, that was another early
4346220	4349420	Netflix original camera. What the fuck the show was called. Somebody in shadow will remember,
4349420	4353500	I'm sure, but those were like some early, early Netflix originals and the quality of those shows
4353500	4357340	was so good. At least the early seasons of orange is new black was pretty good. I don't know about
4357340	4362860	the later ones, but you know, it drew people into the streaming service house of cards. Thank you.
4362860	4368220	That was the other one I was trying to think of with the Kevin Spacey. All right. Um, and then,
4368220	4371580	then they like wrote them out of the very last season or something like that. I remember that
4371580	4377260	was a, a whole thing. So, um, yeah. And then, uh, as 200, Matt says just to test venture with one
4377260	4384220	of their own IPS. So it's nothing to lose. I think it'll go beyond their own IPS eventually. Um,
4384220	4389900	but we'll, we'll stay tuned for that. So, and pod culture says orange is the new black had
4389900	4394380	capable group from Voyager. Yes. That was a reason reason why I watched it actually is that I love
4394380	4398780	Kate Mulgrew and she plays a very different type of character in that show. So, uh, yeah.
4399660	4404620	And then I, I grew to like a lot of the other characters, except the main character hated her,
4405180	4408460	but everybody else was great, but I hated the main character in that show.
4409420	4413500	I don't even remember her name, but I hated her. All right. Well, she's not great in,
4413500	4418460	um, the Handmaid's Tale either, but you know, she in that show too. Well, I don't have a
4418460	4423340	problem with the actor. So I just had a problem with the character. Yeah. All right. All right.
4423340	4427980	My depth and chat says we all did Rob Robert. Okay. They, I'm glad to know I wasn't alone. All
4427980	4436700	right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, dark Sakura. Uh, what do we have next? Um, a move that's
4437500	4444780	honestly, I think just a gesture, but, um, for people who enjoy Overwatch,
4444780	4452140	there is a change coming by renaming the character McCree, who is named after, uh, the,
4452140	4458380	one of the developers who was let go from the company with all of the sexual harassment claims
4458380	4466380	going on. Um, it's a nice gesture, but that's all it is, is a gesture. It doesn't address.
4466460	4471180	I mean, yeah. Remove them. I say remove all references. That's great. That that's good.
4471980	4483020	But yeah, but they, uh, we're also planning on doing, um, a new narrative, uh, in Overwatch
4483020	4488460	in September, but because that character was involved in it, they're delaying it for later
4488460	4496300	in the year. And in the interim are doing a new FFA map, but I'm going to read the direct quote
4496300	4502780	from the development team. Sure. Um, we built the Overwatch universe around the idea of inclusivity
4502780	4509420	equity and the hope, uh, and hope are the building blocks of a better future. We continue to discuss
4509420	4513660	how we best live up to our values and to demonstrate our commitment to creating a game
4513660	4518940	world that reflects them. We believe it's necessary to change the name of the hero currently
4518940	4522700	known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for.
4523340	4528220	And if fortunately the name that they chose was Cosby, the cowboy, and it's just not working out,
4528220	4534220	top it, delete your account. Stop it. They need to call him. Uh, I look like Wolverine, but not
4534220	4541500	really. I think I saw some name that was the Yee-Haw McGraw or something like that. Like just
4541500	4549020	give them a real over the top name. All right. Um, Mike Defton chat says, yeah, another nice
4549900	4554380	gesture, but at the same time, it's like, how does this fix things? And I definitely,
4554380	4559500	um, see that side of it. Um, because I just want to remind everybody it has been one month
4559500	4564220	now since the employees made demands of the leadership at Activision Blizzard King,
4564220	4570620	sometimes known as ABK. And those demands have still gone unheard from by the way,
4570620	4576220	Francis Townsend still employed at ABK for some reason, not sure what that reason is,
4576460	4581020	but that is, uh, something that should be noted has been one month and that those, uh, demands
4581020	4586060	have not been responded to. So they're pulling it. They're pulling a new Orleans. What do you
4586060	4595980	mean by that? Little bitty patches on those, uh, levees, but the storm hits and they break.
4595980	4602300	That may not be the best time to reference with what's going on. No, actually I did it on purpose
4603180	4610460	because I know those situations very well. I grew up in that general area and I'm very
4610460	4616860	pissed at new Orleans for not still having done the proper repairs on it. So I stand by my
4616860	4623500	statement. All right. Um, that's 200 Matt and chat says kind of like, Hey, I know we've been
4623500	4628380	shitty lately, but here is a semi warm cookie. It may or may not have chocolate chips might be
4628380	4637580	oatmeal. Oh, it might be raisins. I hate that. We are getting rid of the chocolate chips that,
4637580	4642220	uh, you know, the folks who are allergic to chocolate, uh, unfortunately we're replacing
4642220	4648780	them with raisins. Oh boy. All right. Uh, anyway, um, let's go in right into the next story because
4648780	4655980	it kind of ties into all of this. Right. Loki. Yeah, unfortunately. Um, so as we know, the,
4655980	4662940	um, California has been, you know, investigating Activision Blizzard for their, um, terrible work
4663740	4670380	place environment. And unfortunately there's also some more to that now. Um, so now we're
4670380	4680140	getting allegations that, um, Activision Blizzard is shredding documents that were requested by,
4680140	4690220	um, the DFEH though. I don't know. That's, that's not good that we're hearing about that.
4690780	4698220	Um, yeah, basically that Activision Blizzard hasn't been cooperative, um, that they have
4699020	4704060	cited their, um, non-disclosure agreements and the requirements that employees must speak with
4704060	4709500	the company before contacting the state department. Um, there, um, of course, uh,
4709500	4718380	Wilmar Hale, who is, you know, busting unions and, um, other, uh, examples of lack of cooperation,
4718380	4723340	but yeah, the shredding documents tooth is also our shredding abuse evidence.
4725100	4731740	And, you know, basically, you know, it's not a good look for them, but of course,
4731820	4736220	Activision comes out and they're saying that, listen, we've done a lot. You know, we've,
4736220	4741100	we've, we've made several high-level personnel changes. We're revamping hiring and recruiting
4741100	4747420	practices and requiring diverse interview panels, greater transparency on pay equality
4747980	4754860	and clear boundaries on workspace behavior with a zero tolerance approach to harassment of their
4754860	4758780	actions that diminish or marginalized. So in other words, they may be saying
4758780	4762620	words, but it's not like an oral fart. That is exactly what I was going to say
4762620	4769180	is that their lips are moving, but all we hear is great minds think like us.
4771820	4778700	So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, this it's typical corporate, you know,
4778700	4783340	it sounds like that they're being as accountable about this as Ubisoft is.
4783340	4790060	So, um, meanwhile, SSJ 100 Matt is continuing the cookie company story going now it's like,
4790060	4794540	while you enjoy that cookie, pay no attention to the man shredding documents behind the curtains.
4797820	4801900	Pay no attention to the guy replacing your chocolate chips with raisins.
4803740	4809020	Evil fucking things. And I mean, both. I don't, I don't hate raisins,
4809420	4815100	but they ain't craisins, which are far superior. So I just want to make that clear.
4815100	4822220	I have a lot of love for craisins. Rob, what, what the cookie of choice is peanut butter,
4822220	4827340	which is fine. No, dark chocolate chip craisin oatmeal cookies.
4828620	4831020	Why would you put all of those things in a cookie together?
4831740	4837820	Because they're amazing. Okay, I don't know. See, I like I guess I guess chocolate and
4838460	4842460	craisin would go together. Okay. But at the same time, when you say the best cookie is,
4842460	4846300	I'm just going to say, Oh, peanut butter, like all those things.
4847180	4851660	They're Samoas. Oh yeah, Samoas are really good too. And snickerdoodles.
4851660	4854060	One last thing, one last thing on the cookie tangent.
4854060	4858060	Okay. One last cookie tangent. When I make black sesame cookies,
4858060	4861500	you have to have one. They're like little goth peanut butter cookies.
4861500	4863500	You gave them to me once. They're really good. I did?
4863500	4867420	Yeah. You brought them over. It was back when OLR. We were still doing it here and you,
4867740	4870940	brought them over one night. They're great. Yeah. My little goth cookies.
4870940	4877020	Yes. That turn my tongue black. Yeah. Those are awesome. I'll make them again.
4877020	4886140	All right. Awesome. Okay. Let's move on completely different topic. Although it does tie into some
4886140	4890860	activism things going on online. You might remember last week on the show, we talked
4890860	4895020	a little bit about the day off of Twitch. That's going to be happening on September 1st.
4895020	4899580	So a little reminder for folks that that is happening on September 1st. And many of your
4899580	4904860	favorite streamers will be participating, but at the same time, there are other streamers that
4905500	4911020	maybe cannot take the day off, whether it's due to their finances or the fact that they have a
4911020	4915500	contractual agreement with some company to play the game on that day. So I think everybody needs
4915500	4920300	to make their own decision and let other people make the decisions that are best for them.
4920860	4926540	Um, however, it is. So what's that? I said agreed. Oh yes. Um, however,
4927500	4933260	with that, um, you know, when we were talking about all that, I talked about how there really
4933260	4939900	isn't going to be pressure on Twitch until there is a competitor to Twitch. Now I'm not about to
4939900	4946220	talk about a competitor to Twitch directly, but this is fucking fascinating to me. So here it is
4946940	4955500	Streamlabs, who a lot of streamers use to, interestingly enough, do things that Twitch
4955500	4963020	can't do, right? So Streamlabs kind of adds things to the stream that Twitch doesn't natively do.
4964380	4971900	Well Streamlabs is also going to now be allowing streamers a way to make money, um, that is monthly
4971900	4978380	tipping. So it's a subscription, if you will, through Streamlabs. So yeah, I got an email
4978380	4985340	about that cause I already have, um, the direct ship, uh, tip jar. Yeah. Yeah. So now it's a way
4985340	4993820	for streamers to set up a subscription service and creators get 100% after PayPal takes their fees.
4993820	5000060	So it's going to be a lot different than the 50 50, um, down for this now, but here, here's the
5000060	5004380	thing. Uh, so, so the Streamlabs creator subscription, that's going to probably be more
5004380	5010540	appealing to people than Twitch's built-in service, but you should be aware. Remember
5010540	5017100	when you do the Twitch subs, you lose the ads and all that stuff. Streamlabs can't interface with
5017100	5021980	that. So if you're selling subs through this, Twitch is not going to treat these people like
5021980	5026140	Twitch subscribers because they're not Twitch subscribers. So any of those benefits that come
5026140	5031420	with a Twitch subscription, such as ad-free viewing or extra emotes or emotes at all,
5031420	5035260	um, that's not going to be available through this. So there is going to be a trade-off there. So I
5035260	5039180	just, I need to make that clear because I feel like that's an easy misconception when people
5039180	5043260	are reading about this and going, Oh, Streamlabs is competing with Twitch. Well, they're competing
5043260	5047900	on that amount of the money you get front, but they can't compete on that technical front because
5047980	5057180	Streamlabs isn't directly a Twitch competitor yet. That's me inserting that word. I have nothing
5057180	5062780	further to go off of, but I can't help but wonder. If Slots was worth actually freaking using,
5062780	5070220	then maybe. I can't help but wonder. Nah, I don't think so. They don't have the infrastructure for
5070220	5074380	it, but, um, it is cool that they're doing that. It sounds to me, it's almost like an
5074380	5081660	alternative to Patreon versus like, say, um, you know, what you would get with Twitch.
5082460	5088300	It's still something though that like they could basically try to, you know, say, Hey, you want to,
5088300	5091980	you know, contribute instead of like Patreon or something like that, you can do that through this
5091980	5096700	Streamlabs thing. And then it'll be all integrated within Twitch or something like that. Um, which is
5096700	5101900	kind of cool, I guess. Now, Tigerclaw brings up, um, in chat, there are many places to stream to
5101900	5106060	other than Twitch. Using a service like Restream, it gives you tons of places you can stream to
5106060	5110940	other than Twitch. True. There are two problems with that. Number one, when you are a Twitch
5110940	5115260	affiliate and you do decide to make money off Twitch, you're actually violating the terms with
5115260	5121420	Twitch to automatically Restream your content because you do, uh, say in that fine print that
5121420	5126380	and I, I a hundred percent realize people are not playing by the rules. They're doing that at their
5126380	5133100	own risk of peril. Okay. But like, for example, we don't simulcast to YouTube because it's part
5133100	5139180	of the agreement that we're on Twitch for a 24 hour period. And then we can, you know, if we
5139180	5142700	wanted to put a clip of the show on YouTube or whatever, we could do that. Um, I was also,
5142700	5147740	some of us are eventually trying to make partner. Yeah. So we absolutely don't want to ruin that.
5147740	5152940	I was also reminded when I talked about that there are no competitors to Twitch on last week's show,
5152940	5158940	I was reminded offline that Facebook gaming exists and I'm going to stand by what I
5158940	5165020	originally said on last week's show. There are no competitors to Twitch. Facebook gaming,
5165020	5171100	as far as I'm concerned is a non-factor and watch, I may have to eat my words in five years,
5171100	5176060	but if you allow Facebook to take over the gaming space, you people are fucking fools.
5176060	5181180	I said it, I said it, you know what? I know you're not supposed to say it,
5181820	5188460	but I cannot stand Facebook getting into this gaming space and all of these other things.
5189020	5196780	They can't keep misinformation and bullshit off their platform. I do not want that in the gaming
5196780	5203900	space. Period. So Facebook gaming, as far as I'm concerned is an illegitimate competitor.
5203900	5207580	It is not going to get a seat at the big kids table in my eyes.
5207580	5211180	If you disagree with me, that's fine. And I'm sorry to those that work very hard to
5211180	5216460	establish their Facebook gaming channels. I personally think you made a poor business decision.
5220780	5225740	So video games, they're lovely, aren't they? Yeah. I have a few.
5225740	5236780	Anyway. Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the people who got lured in by Facebook
5236780	5240780	gaming in the beginning served the length of their contract and went right back to Twitch.
5242060	5247340	Mike Deff says Facebook gaming is big in other countries though. Well, you know what? Friendster
5247340	5252060	was big in other countries for a very long time. And that's no, look, that's no disrespect. I'm not
5252060	5256780	trying to disrespect that, but I'm just saying, you know, people will gravitate towards one space
5256780	5260060	and my thoughts when it comes to Facebook gaming is still the same. I don't care what country
5260060	5265500	you're in. Facebook has no business getting in that space. Yeah. Mike Deff says so many
5265500	5271260	people in Mexico don't know what Twitch is and that, but that's on Twitch to some extent there.
5271260	5276380	Yeah. Bobby Black Wolf points out live journal is still big in Russia. I have a huge spot in my
5276380	5280780	heart for live journal. I met my husband on live journal. I met Dark Soccer and Loki pretty much
5280780	5285180	on live. Even if we didn't meet, I may not have met them on live journal, but our friendship was
5285180	5289100	strengthened by live journal, I think is a nice way to put it. You know, in the community that
5289100	5293500	was there. Do I give a shit about live journal in its current form? Absolutely not. Although,
5293500	5296380	oh no, they didn't. It's fun to look at once in a great while. They got some good gifts.
5297100	5304380	So that's it, you know? Yeah. And Bobby Black Wolf brings up that story about there's apparently
5304380	5309740	a new young adult novel about a kid trying to find out who her mom is by finding her dad's
5309740	5316780	live journal. Wow. And usually, usually I read these tips after the show, but I have to
5316780	5323020	acknowledge She-Hulk 10 donating 100 biddies. Thank you very much. But it's the comment for me
5323020	5329980	where it says Pornhub gaming would be fun. Honestly, She-Hulk honestly, honestly,
5330940	5333820	I'm very surprised they haven't tried to enter the space.
5333820	5342940	Hmm. Maybe not directly, but Pornhub's got its subsidiaries and Loki, you just said, you know,
5344140	5348220	the stream labs can't get into the space because they don't have the infrastructure for it. Well,
5348940	5354940	Streamlabs, meet Pornhub. Pornhub, meet Streamlabs. Now kiss.
5357660	5358460	Yeah, I can see that.
5358460	5366620	Streamhub. Perfect. Thank you, Orange Right. Streamhub, Pornlabs. Probably not. I think
5366620	5371340	Orange Right might have the better name there, PodCulture, for what they're trying to put on
5371340	5379340	this space. But yeah. Anyway. Bobby Black Wolf points out there's already a triple X game
5379340	5383180	streaming site, or at least there was. Yeah, again, a lot. And I'm well aware there are
5383180	5387500	other competitors out there too, and I don't mean to shit on any of them, except for one that I've
5387500	5393420	already named. But some of these other ones that are like the up and comers, that's just,
5393420	5398460	they're up and comers. And I stress this on last week's show, I don't want to repeat myself too
5398460	5404860	much, but just the whole fact that they don't have that path to make money easily laid out the way
5404860	5410060	that Amazon backed Twitch has right now, which is why people are still, when people just say,
5410060	5414380	we'll go to a different platform. People are like, no, this is our platform. This is where
5414380	5418300	we've established our community. This is where I'm going to fight to make work, which is what
5418300	5422460	Dark Soccer is also referencing there. In spite of all this, I'm going to make partner on this
5422460	5429420	website, and we're going to work with what we've got. Yeah, VG Realness in chat says,
5429420	5433900	Pornhub has the infrastructure to take out YouTube and Twitch, and they're sleeping on it.
5433900	5442460	I 100% agree, VG Realness, and I'm wondering what it's going to take for them to get into that world.
5442460	5448460	Probably the whole content management stuff, because right now they don't have good
5448460	5453260	relationships, I think, with their payment processors because the whole issue with the
5455340	5460940	stolen content and all that stuff. So if they can't manage that in just the platforms that
5460940	5469580	they have now, then why add to that? Plus they own several, they own so many streaming sites
5469580	5476060	outside of just the Pornhub stuff. They pretty much own the whole thing,
5476060	5481820	like all of the streaming services. It's ridiculous. Like RedTube, is that them too?
5483660	5489980	There's one that's shutting down at the end of the month or next month that is very similar,
5489980	5494620	but it must not be part of Pornhub if it's closing. It's XXX something.
5494620	5499580	They've got the RedTube, Tube8, Thumbzilla, they have so many.
5499580	5501020	I'm sorry, did you say Tube8?
5502220	5503500	Yeah, Tube8.
5503500	5505980	Okay. All right.
5505980	5509180	It's like six different sites, so it's just ridiculous.
5510060	5514460	Interesting. All right. Enough talk about Pornhub, but I couldn't help but talk about
5514460	5519740	that with the streamers. So anyway, I didn't get to this, but I will say Streamlabs,
5520300	5527500	also keep in mind the tipping can be integrated into OBS, and OBS allows you to go to YouTube,
5528060	5532060	if you want, Facebook, TikTok. I didn't even know you could stream to TikTok.
5532060	5536780	Yeah, there's actually a guy I watch who does Minecraft. He does live streaming from TikTok
5536780	5538220	and Twitch simultaneously.
5538220	5545820	Well, maybe TikTok is I in this space too. I don't know. Anyway, Streamlabs lets creators
5545820	5551180	decide what they're basically selling with their subscription and set the price point on that.
5551180	5555420	There's also going to be leaderboards, badges, and all that fun stuff there. But again,
5555420	5559180	I can't stress this enough. It is outside of Twitch, so it's not going to disable some of
5559180	5563020	those things that Twitch does with their subscriptions. So keep that in mind when
5563020	5564540	you're weighing all these different options.
5564540	5569420	Well, I mean, they were talking about putting ads on people that subscribe to the channels too,
5569420	5573980	haven't they? So who knows what's outside of Twitch at this point?
5574700	5580620	Well, they better not until they fix some of the bullshit that Dark Sakura can speak to firsthand,
5580620	5583420	because I know you had to deal with that bullshit in this past week.
5583420	5592700	So until they fix that shit, that's like still actively happening. I really would not do things
5592700	5598860	to make people further teeter on the edge of leaving this site. So, all right.
5598860	5607740	Anyhow, let's go back to a simpler time when we didn't stream games in our next segment.
5618620	5624140	Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a
5624140	5628780	classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5632700	5643420	I picked Picross DS. It is a puzzle game that was developed by Jupiter and published by
5643420	5652380	Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is the second Picross game to be released. The first one
5652380	5661420	was Mario's Picross, but it failed outside of Japan. There were a bunch more Picross games
5661420	5673180	in Japan, but this one apparently did a bit better. So basically you have different
5673260	5683420	nonogram logic puzzles. With this is that you have to mark each square as full or empty,
5683420	5688700	and it eventually reveals what the picture is. You can also create your own puzzles,
5688700	5693420	send them to other people, download some classic puzzles, speed competitions using the Nintendo
5693420	5702860	Wi-Fi connection. Or you also have a daily and online challenge mode where you receive a hint
5702940	5708380	that reveals one randomly selected row and column. It doesn't affect your player time,
5709340	5714380	and three different kinds of background music can be selected except in classic puzzle mode
5714380	5718540	and the unlockable extra 11 extra puzzles. Or you can turn the music off.
5719180	5724220	So you do have different modes. And by the way, the only one I could find without someone talking
5724220	5737180	over it was a speedrun. But anyway, in normal mode, you get told to mark a square that should
5737180	5744620	be unmarked. If your first mistake happens, you get a penalty of two minutes. The second,
5744620	5748860	four, and each of the following mistake, eight minutes. You can choose from an easy mode that's
5748860	5760620	five by five or 10 by 10 puzzles. It can go up to 25 by 20. So you have all kinds of just different
5760620	5767820	things that you do. So you have different timed mini games. You can also unlock one called catch
5767820	5772700	where one by one squares float around the grid and you have to tap them to clear the mode or sketch
5772700	5775980	where the top screen displays a picture and you have to copy it on the bottom screen.
5776620	5781340	And then there's also hit where you hit squares and make them disappeared once you have a certain
5781340	5789500	number tap mode is cleared. Your music choices are jazz, reggae, and bossa nova. You also have
5789500	5793820	free mode. If you're not told when you make a mistake, they just get harder and harder to
5793820	5798540	complete. You also have the mini games, but they're more difficult in free mode.
5799100	5803980	And then in free mode, you get rock house and ambient for your music choices.
5806060	5816540	So the game actually, with this one, it got a reading of 9.4 out of 10 by one reviewer. And it
5816540	5826700	was basically ranked fairly high for a P-Cross game to be released since Mario's P-Cross.
5826700	5833980	Mario's P-Cross, it did get some pretty favorable reviews, but this one topped it.
5835420	5841180	And so, I just picked a little game. It's something that maybe not a lot of people
5841180	5848140	have a lot of experience in that maybe it's something unique and different.
5849340	5853740	What's that game that Bobby had talked about before, Murder by Numbers or something?
5853740	5860220	But that's kind of like this too. It's a P-Cross game.
5862620	5865260	And me personally, I'm not the biggest fan of P-Cross,
5865980	5872300	but it is a fun little time sink from time to time. Much better than a Minesweeper.
5874060	5878220	There you go. Now, one thing I will say about the P-Cross,
5879020	5882940	because you mentioned it kind of in the beginning and you just brought it up again as Mario P-Cross,
5883580	5889020	that is one of the games that's on the Nintendo Switch library. They added it a little later.
5889020	5895340	It wasn't in the initial set. So people might not realize it's there, but if you want to sample a
5895340	5900780	P-Cross game, that's a great place to start. Because obviously the DS games are a little
5900780	5905660	harder to play now just because they don't really sell them for the Switch or anything.
5906780	5910300	I mean, you can find a used copy at your local Game Flop or whatever, but
5911260	5915420	I still think Mario P-Cross is worth a look. It's still quite good.
5917100	5921500	Well, at any rate, there were other versions. Of course, Mario's P-Cross came out before that.
5922140	5929580	Afterwards, Nintendo and HAL Laboratory did P-Cross 3D. There's also Essential Sudoku DS,
5929580	5935420	which has, I guess, a P-Cross mode and P-Cross E, which is Jupiter's other follow-up for Nintendo
5935500	5947260	3DS. But basically, P-Cross is based off of the concept of nonograms, which are logic puzzles
5947260	5952220	that require you fill in the right things based on numbers. Yep. So you can actually find nonograms
5952220	5960700	in those penny press puzzle magazines and things like that. Yeah. So there you go. There it is,
5960700	5966620	your classic game of the week, P-Cross DS on the Nintendo DS. Great, great shout out.
5966620	5971820	Bobby Blackall pointing out, I got into it, meaning P-Cross, with the Pokemon P-Cross
5971820	5976300	free-to-play game on 3DS. Yeah. Yeah. I think that might've been the first one I played too.
5976300	5981500	There was a Zelda one as well, I remember, that was really good. So check that out. I don't know
5981500	5984780	if that one was free. I can't remember. Bobby Blackall also points out there's a billion
5984780	5989500	nonogram apps out there. Absolutely. They're not called P-Cross, but they might be called
5989580	5995340	Picture-Cross or something like that. So there's other ones. So very cool. All right. Great pick.
5996700	5999900	I got to talk about this. So ready for a food tangent, everybody?
5999900	6005980	So I had no idea that these were things that existed, but you know that grandpa Matt or
6005980	6009740	captain Matt, depending on if you listen to Hoard House or Starboard Power Coupling when
6009740	6013900	those shows were around, for those of you that know him, he likes to send me all the pumpkin
6013900	6019340	shit in the entire world. I was wondering if that happened yet. Well, okay. So here's what happened.
6019340	6025980	I ordered some more masks for Dragon Con because I wanted to refresh my collection a little bit.
6025980	6031500	So I ordered some more mass at Amazon. A certain package got here first and I opened it and I was,
6031500	6039180	what the hell is this? And it was a bag of pumpkin pie Kit Kats is what showed up. And it is part of
6040620	6047980	grandpa Matt's pumpkin thing he does. The pumpkin spice lattes are back and they are fabulous as
6047980	6053660	always. However, with as much shit as I get for liking pumpkin and being called basic and all
6053660	6060380	that stuff, I want to point out, they also rolled out an apple drink, that apple macchiato. I told
6060380	6066300	you this was coming out. It's pretty fucking good. That's what I hear, except I hate caramel. Is the
6066300	6070300	caramel flavor strong? Just order it without it. Cause I think it's the drizzle they put on top.
6071260	6079580	Yeah. Like I was told to try the apple syrup in a chai. Yes. And I think they do a frat with it
6079580	6083260	as well. And I haven't, I haven't tried either that, but yeah, the apple is a standalone syrup.
6083260	6088620	So I'm probably going to be giving that a go tomorrow. Well, I normally do my pink drink
6088620	6092140	cause it's one of the things that doesn't make me sick. Oh yeah. I like the pink drinks too,
6092700	6100620	but I, I really want to try the apple in a, in a chai. So Renee Yasiner chat, hi,
6100620	6105660	it's so good to see you. Uh, says, uh, pumpkin pie and then I'm a slut for their apple drinks.
6105660	6110780	I mean, same TBH, like with as much shit as I get for the pumpkin thing, I will do a lot for
6110780	6118780	an apple drink as well. They are quite tasty. So say that. I am not finding a pumpkin spice, uh,
6118780	6124540	Reese's on a, you probably need to give it a few more weeks. It is still early in the pumpkin
6124540	6129980	season. I am used to the pumpkin spice latte coming out the day I leave for dragon con. So
6129980	6134140	I feel like it was a whole week early this year than usual, but yeah. So anyway, I'm going to
6134140	6138460	enjoy one of these pumpkin pie kit cats, which are quite tasty. You know what they taste like
6138460	6144620	pumpkin pie. Um, and it's good cause the, the wafer kind of kit cats. I love had those before.
6144620	6148300	They're good. Japanese ones are better. Pod culture says there's an apple mountain
6148300	6152380	dew coming out. That sounds like it might be pretty tasty. Anyway. Yeah. I've had the,
6152380	6157740	I've had the pumpkin pie ones before and I honestly truly believe that the Japanese,
6157740	6164380	a couple of Joe ones were a lot better. There's some great flavors in Japan. I'm excited that
6164380	6171180	we're finally getting some of that shit in the U S and it only took like 50 flavors of Oreos
6171180	6176700	for other companies to catch on that like, Hey, people like wacky zany flavors. So there was
6176700	6183180	another flavor that's out that I think that you would like Rob banana caramel. I love banana.
6183980	6190220	Heck yeah. They do have a banana like us when they're doing in the U S but one of the current
6190220	6194860	Japanese flavors is banana caramel. And if I find it, I'll get you some. Yeah. A pod culture says
6194860	6198540	there was a key lime kit cat. That was awesome. Yeah. The key that that was something that was
6198540	6204220	around. Those are pretty good. There's a mint one. There was, um, some other flavor. I kind
6204220	6210220	of dig the duos. Yeah. The mint and the mocha ones. Yeah. Anyway. All right. Enough food. Yeah. I
6210220	6215180	know back to video games, but Hey, you know what? I snack on a lot of Kit Kat bars. Well, I mean,
6215180	6219580	well not, not too many, but enough. Oh, I'm playing video games. So let's travel around
6219580	6223660	the world and quickly talk about some other things going on in the gaming world. Uh, Loki,
6223660	6229820	we'll start with you. Loki. I think you're muted, which will explain why I heard you say
6229820	6234140	not a thing about Kit Kats, which is unfortunate, but that's all right. I don't really like Kit Kat.
6234140	6240460	They're okay. Yes. Yeah. So, um, we talked a little bit about April and Neil coming to
6240460	6246220	the new Ninja turtles game. Um, but she's also going to be coming to another game,
6246380	6253580	Nickelodeon all-star brawl. So we have April Neil coming to that game as well as a fighting game
6253580	6260620	character and then cat dog also coming to that game as well. It's a really shaping up to be a
6260620	6266060	pretty awesome game. So now I'm not hearing Lori Beth Denberg, but, or moose from, you can't do
6266060	6270300	that on television. I'm not hearing these Nickelodeon things yet, but it's still time.
6270300	6276060	There's still time. Yeah. So I never really watched cat dog, but like,
6276060	6279260	it is cool to see all these other characters coming to the game. So
6281500	6286540	I mean, let's keep you coming. I want to hear about all the characters and DLC and all this
6286540	6293660	fun stuff. And then along with that, uh, the Lego star Wars Skywalker saga was something that they
6293660	6299180	were showing off during games com and it is coming out next year. Now sometime in, uh, spring
6299180	6304700	of 2022 is when they announced that they had a new trailer for that. Um, you know, it looks cool. I'm
6304700	6308860	not, I never really played the Lego star Wars games. It was more of the Lego Marvel stuff, but
6309660	6317900	I have to check it out. All right. Dark soccer. What do you have for us? Um, there is a final
6317900	6325500	fantasy four pixel remaster, uh, coming out for, uh, computers and for mobile. Um,
6326220	6332300	on it looks like September 8th, it looks pretty cool. I definitely, uh, I'm considering that one
6332300	6340060	because I love it. I love, and then I'm sorry. I love four. I hate that font in the remasters,
6340060	6344860	but I might just have to suck it up and deal with it. I did hear through the grapevine just random
6344860	6349260	that you spoonie barred is still intact in the final fantasy four, uh, pixel remaster,
6349260	6357100	which is the most important part of the game. It must be. So at any rate, um, also horizon
6357100	6363980	forbidden West has been officially delayed until 2022. Uh, the date they are listing now is
6363980	6369900	February 18th. There are starting orders for it though. So there's that. Nice. What's their,
6369900	6374380	their game then coming out this fall? Like what Sony got other than the horizon?
6374380	6381260	I don't think there is one flatulence. Uh, I, I think they're relying on third party and just
6381980	6386620	the, you know, the system did very well last year. Um, I mean, with as many of them as you
6386620	6390700	could find. Um, so I kind of think they're just trying to ride that wave until, uh,
6391420	6396380	I mean, if you want to be technical final fantasy 14 and Walker is a PlayStation five title,
6396380	6400140	and that's something that Xbox doesn't have, but of course it's on PC as we all know,
6401180	6407180	but technically that is a holiday title. So that's all I got. All right. Well,
6407180	6411500	I guess that's fine. There's no systems to be had. So, you know, why,
6411500	6418460	why bother putting out games to sell the system? All right. Uh, and some of the folks in chat are,
6418460	6423260	um, giving me tips on my font issue with final fantasy, uh, the pixel remasters,
6423260	6427980	my fifth dream says it's easily moddable and dark Tetsuya says you can swap the font for the
6427980	6432460	one in the Japanese language version. It's much better now. That's I'm, I'm interested in that.
6432460	6437580	So I'll have to look up how to do that. I think I will finally, you know, suck it up and buy at
6437580	6441420	least the first game just to see what they're like and then make a decision from there. If,
6441420	6445260	if it's going to be worth it for the really the holy Trinity of four or five and six, let's be
6445260	6449980	real. Um, two and three are okay, but they're not four or five and six. Let's be honest. All right.
6450540	6454940	Um, okay. I think that was it for rapid fire news. So let's travel around the world and check
6454940	6460540	out some release dates, things coming a little sooner than, uh, well, I guess not that much
6460540	6465180	sooner than the final fantasy four pixel remaster sooner than the final fantasy six pixel remaster.
6465180	6471580	What's coming out next week. So we got a game called lake. That's going to be on PC and Xbox
6471580	6480140	one, uh, bravely default two on PC, uh, demon gaze extra on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.
6480860	6486620	We have a Kataria fables on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
6486620	6493900	Xbox one and Xbox series X, WRC 10 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one,
6493900	6501580	Xbox series X, big rumble boxing, creed champions on PC, Nintendo switch,
6501580	6508060	PlayStation four and Xbox one. Uh, we have the medium coming out on PlayStation five
6509180	6515180	and that's it. I didn't realize the medium wasn't staying an Xbox exclusive. I thought that was a
6515180	6520460	exclusive. I guess I was wrong. It's not. All right. So I guess it was, or it was one of those
6520460	6525020	limited windows or something. All right. Uh, traveling to Japan, uh, checking out the Nintendo
6525020	6529820	switch this week, demon gaze extra in a regular and limited edition is out in Japan this week on
6529820	6536300	the Nintendo switch as is port Royal four, uh, and then big rubble boxing creed champions is out there
6536300	6541020	as well. Uh, and that is pretty much all the releases on the switch. However, peaking at the
6541020	6547660	PlayStation five, uh, we have that same port Royal four game is out there as well. And sadly, we
6547660	6552060	don't really start to pick up releases. I'll just read this one for September 9th. Cause this is
6552060	6556380	kind of a big deal. Tales of arise is out on the PlayStation five. And I kind of think that's the
6556380	6561420	big tent pole release, but that'll be in the week that we're off. So, um, that is something to look
6561420	6566460	forward to for sure. Uh, dark soccer. How about the UK? I'm going to do the two weeks worth.
6566460	6575020	Sure. So we have, um, on the 31st forgotten city, uh, we have rustler and we have Kiwi,
6575660	6581740	I guess that's how it's pronounced. Um, and then it's K E Y W E which it looks like they're little
6581740	6589580	Kiwi birds. So, um, then in September on the second, we have WRC 10, we have Arashi castles
6589580	6598780	of sin, the medium, Kitaria fables, Rico London, um, monster harvest. And then on the seventh,
6598780	6603980	we have bus simulator, 21 Chernobyl light on the 10th, also on the 10th.
6603980	6610140	Why are you aware? Get it together. Big rumble boxing, creed championships, family trainer,
6610780	6619580	NBA two K 22 tales of arise. And that's, uh, that's it. Um, Loki, since Jamie and I did it,
6619580	6623260	did you want to circle back to the U S and talk about, um, the week that we're off? Cause I get,
6623260	6627260	I think that tales of rise of Wario aware in that week, those are pretty big releases.
6627900	6632220	Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, for the week of the seventh, we've got, uh, Chernobyl, but,
6632220	6639980	or yeah, Chernobyl light on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, fist forged in shadow torch,
6639980	6646620	uh, that is on PC PlayStation born PlayStation five sonic colors, ultimate on PC,
6646620	6652300	Nintendo switch PlayStation born Xbox one, uh, the art full escape on PC,
6652380	6659980	Xbox one and Xbox series X toy soldiers, HD on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one
6660620	6665900	life is strange. True colors on PC and, uh, PlayStation four PlayStation five,
6665900	6672860	Xbox one, Xbox series X and stadia. We have a Lawson random that's on PC,
6672860	6680540	Nintendo switch PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, NBA two K 22 on PC,
6680540	6686620	Nintendo switch PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, uh, tales of
6686620	6693020	rise on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X. And last but not least,
6693020	6697420	why are you aware? Get it together on Nintendo switch. All right. I'm glad we covered that
6697420	6701340	week. Cause that's a huge week. I forget the week after labor day tends to always be a big
6701340	6705580	week for some reason. So it's kind of like the kickoff of the holiday season. It's as weird as
6705580	6709660	it is to say that I really feel like that first week of September is when you really start to see
6709660	6714460	the releases start to amp up a little bit towards, um, black Friday. It's basically like between
6714460	6718860	labor day and black Friday are all your big game releases of the year. Well, not all, but a good,
6718860	6723580	probably 75%. Well, it's like the start of the fourth quarter stuff. So yeah, that too, that too.
6723580	6728940	So, all right. Uh, there you go for the world release dates. Let's get back into some other
6728940	6734060	gaming news and then we're going to get to, uh, the listener round table, which, uh, remember we
6734060	6738540	are taking calls on discord again, so you can join our green room over at vog network.com slash
6738540	6743580	discord, if you want to call into the show tonight. Um, but you also, um, can, uh, speak
6743580	6747900	up in our chat room and then we'll see if we have any emails this week over at participate
6747900	6755740	at orange launch radio.com. But first more news Loki. Yeah. So South Korea is abolishing their,
6755740	6763100	uh, gaming shutdown law. So the shutdown law banned children under the age of 16 years old
6763100	6769580	from playing video games between, uh, 12 midnight and 6.00 AM in the morning, I guess, to help them
6769580	6775820	in school or something like that. Um, and apparently companies could be fined if they allowed,
6775820	6781180	uh, players to be able to do that. They were fitting that age range. So now they are going
6781180	6786380	to be getting rid of that and says for use games are often important, leisurely activities and
6786380	6791740	communication channel. I hope that the preventative measures can respect the rights of the youth
6792300	6799340	and encourage a healthy home education. So, um, they're going to basically allow them to be
6799340	6804620	protected through a choice system, which allows parents and their legal guardians to be able to,
6804620	6810380	uh, permit and regulate the number of hours. So putting in the power or giving it to the, uh,
6810380	6815740	families to regulate that, which makes sense. I mean, if you have like, you know, kids, maybe they
6815740	6818860	stay up late on the weekends, they'll play that. I don't know if this is necessarily just during
6818860	6823340	the week or if it's just every single day, but yeah, at least it's going away. So that
6823340	6828540	makes it a lot easier for software companies as well. Yeah. I was like, I might know one adult
6828540	6835180	in here who is playing no man's sky at 1 AM on Saturday morning. I mean, I'm an adult,
6835180	6840380	I'll do what I want. Um, but I, I also, I wonder if there's maybe some pandemic stuff that plays
6840380	6843660	into that. I mean, I know these are younger kids, we're talking about like 16 and under,
6843660	6847100	but I wonder if there's something about the whole, like, you know what they're staying indoors,
6847100	6851100	playing video games, that's where we need kids to be right now. So I wonder if there's some of that
6851100	6858540	playing into it too. Possibly. Um, well, speaking of pandemic related things or things that we tried
6858540	6865580	to, uh, blame or, um, I guess pin on the pandemic, I want to go back to the Pokemon go controversy.
6865580	6870220	So we talked a couple of weeks ago on the show about the, uh, controversy around the change of,
6870220	6874860	uh, taking the stop, uh, radius spinning. So basically the radius that you have to be standing
6874860	6879420	from a stop in order to be able to spin it, you may recall they increased that to 80 meters at
6879420	6883740	the start of the pandemic. And a few weeks ago, they lowered that back to 40 meters, which
6883740	6889260	basically pissed off a lot of the fans of the game that had gotten used to the 80 meter, 80 meter
6889260	6895580	radius. Well, um, I'm going to admit this surprised me. Um, it came out this week in a tweet. Pokemon
6895580	6901100	go app said, uh, in a tweet trainers were looking forward to sharing our plans as a result of the
6901100	6904540	task force on September 1st. Remember that they're going to, uh, they, they put together
6904540	6909980	that task force of YouTubers and influencers to talk about all this stuff. Uh, but they continue
6909980	6915740	in the tweet, but one thing does not have to wait from now on 80 meters will be the base interaction
6915740	6922780	radius for pokey stops and gyms globally. So they did take that radius back to 80 meters. Uh, and I
6922780	6929740	I'm assuming the crowd rejoiced, uh, on that end of things. Um, I'm sort of waiting for the other
6929740	6934460	shoe to drop because they're still waiting. Like they're still saying we're going to announce the
6934460	6940060	rest of the task force on September 1st. So I'm sort of waiting for that. And the radius is back
6940060	6947100	to 80 meters, but we still got to make money off this game. You have to buy an 80 meter pass in
6947100	6951500	order to know, cause they've already implemented it back in the game. So there's no 80 meter pass
6951500	6956300	or anything like that, but I'm, I'm still waiting for the, but if you spin it more than five times
6956300	6963340	in an hour, congrats, all you're going to get are purple potions. Please enjoy them purple potions
6963340	6968860	and, um, the banana thing. That's Nanab berries. That was a useless one. Yeah. That's all you're
6968860	6974860	going to get from those stops. Um, still waiting to see what that is. Uh, going to our chat because
6974860	6979500	I know two of our big Pokemon pals are in chat. S200. Matt says, I still don't believe this will
6979500	6985180	be forever. Niantic really wanted to keep the 40 meter thing. I apparently they got talked into it.
6985420	6991100	I actually feel like this 80 meter is going to stick, but there might be, I still think there's
6991100	6996380	another side to the coin, but we'll see. Uh, Mike Defton chat says, yay for the radius increase,
6996380	7002620	but we definitely need to say, see what they say on September 1st. Yes. Let's wait for the other.
7002620	7007660	Let's keep the confetti cannons. Just store it away. You can ready them, but don't pull the
7007660	7013740	trigger on the confetti cannons until we hear what else is changing about the game. Because we are,
7013740	7017820	it already was data mined that we're going to do this stuff with like powering up pokey stops and
7017820	7023900	things like that. I'm just, what is, what is, what is the other half of this? I'm waiting to see.
7023900	7029180	We'll see. We'll see. All right. But I knew our Pokemon Go fans in the house would appreciate
7029180	7033820	that. By the way, how many of you have been rating the new, uh, uh, Zacian and Zamzenta,
7033820	7039660	the Galar region, the Pokemon sword and shield legendaries is so weird to see in Pokemon Go
7039660	7044460	already. But, uh, I picked up one Zacian. I wish I'd done more. I didn't do enough of
7044460	7048460	those raids because hello, you could transfer them to your sword and shield game through
7048460	7055020	Pokemon home. Like the easiest way to get those legendaries. Gosh. So yeah. Um, I have a couple
7055020	7059420	Zamzatas for now though, or if I'm even saying that right, I'm probably not, I'm probably missing
7059420	7066860	an N or something, but anyway, uh, it's just weird. Uh, Mike Defton chat says, uh, I did my
7066860	7072700	Pokedex registry and that's it. Uh, bonds 006 says Zamazenta. I got two of each. So there you
7072700	7078700	go. Pod culture says I need one. So yeah, it's, uh, try to look for those raids in your area.
7078700	7083100	See if there's a, here's, I guess where I'll recommend Facebook. See if you have a local
7083100	7087820	Pokemon Go Facebook group in your area. You probably do. And there's probably a discord
7087820	7091900	server for it too. And there's a lot of people that do raid organizing in those places. So it's
7091980	7094940	probably the best way to find. And even if not, you can probably find like,
7095740	7100140	even though Sacramento as a whole, you know, there's like a million people in the region.
7100140	7104940	Sacramento as a whole uses discord with Pokemon Go community, but like the locals here like to
7104940	7109180	use group me for some weird, it's like the worst of the messaging apps. I don't know why they like
7109180	7115180	it, but they do. So, uh, that's where the locals are to look for raids. But I use, um, there's
7115180	7120300	actually a network of Ingress players that also play Pokemon that use telegram to coordinate the
7120300	7125020	remote raids. And that's what I use. That's how I got all those, uh, things that I have is, uh,
7125020	7131260	using telegram looking for raids. So, uh, as Joe and her map points out pokey Raider. That's right.
7131260	7135500	They've built all separate apps and websites for the remote raid stuff too. I always forget about
7135500	7139900	that. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Moving on dark soccer. Let's get to this story, which I think is
7139900	7149820	kind of neat. So, um, EA has, um, patented accessibility options that are free for all
7149820	7157980	developers and publishers to use in their game, um, in their games. Um, so these various patents,
7157980	7164540	um, as they've been shared are contextually aware communication systems and video games,
7164540	7171420	um, which includes apex legends, uh, ping system, uh, systems and methods for automated
7171420	7176620	image processing with images with similar luminosities. So those are for color vision
7176620	7184700	deficiencies, uh, constant ratio detection and rendering system that allows, um, the system to
7184700	7191580	automatically detect and update subpart contrast regions again for visibility and personalized
7191580	7199100	real-time audio generation based on user physiological response. So basically, um, this
7199100	7209020	wasn't developed by EA yet. It's just been patented. Um, but it would, uh, basically give,
7209020	7220300	uh, clues based on how a player would hear. So they're, uh, really wanting to improve, uh,
7221020	7229020	the ability of disabled people. I reckon to be able to play games and enjoy them as much
7229020	7234540	as an abled person. Well, I think, you know, and I agree with our Tetsuya in our chat room.
7234540	7239500	I know EA has done some scummy stuff in the past, but I can appreciate this. Yes, this is,
7239500	7245660	you know, these types. Why patent it though, if they're not going to, I don't understand.
7245660	7249660	They're making it available for other people. They may have it in development,
7250380	7255740	but they want to have the patent down first. I guess they may have been worried. That's normal.
7255740	7259980	Yeah. They may have worried someone else would patent it too, when they do want to include it
7259980	7264620	in their own games. And they're trying to do that good guy, EA thing, especially. I mean,
7265260	7270460	I don't want to think this is the case, but I worry it may be, especially when their biggest
7270460	7278540	peers in the industry right now, EA, I'm sorry, Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft, like EA has kind
7278540	7283900	of not been in that conversation. And I think that's where they prefer to be. Um,
7284300	7289900	so I think these sort of public interests, doing a good thing, sorts of things are very good for
7289900	7295260	EA right now. And they know it. Um, so again, I want to believe it's not tied to that and it
7295260	7301980	is completely separate and independent and just, you know, good guy, EA. Um, I, I don't know that
7301980	7306300	I a hundred percent put faith that there isn't some interesting timing going on with all this.
7307100	7316380	Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's, it's a might suss yo. Yeah. Sus, I think is a good way to put
7316380	7322700	it. Um, regardless, let's try to focus on the end result, which is good thing. So, you know,
7322700	7328780	sus or not the end result is a good thing. So, all right. Um, let's move on. Loki,
7328780	7334700	let's go back to saints row, but, um, for good reason, uh, this is, I know this is very upsetting
7334700	7340700	for many people in the community. Yes. So unfortunately, like right after we got the
7340700	7347260	announcement of the super lackluster or scenes for a reboot trailer, um, we also got the
7347260	7353420	announcement of one of the champions of saints row two, and it's basically a community developer
7353420	7359660	that's been working on saints row two for the longest time with gentlemen of the row. He,
7359660	7367580	he went by the name idle ninja. Well, his real name was Mike Watson. And while he was champions
7367580	7374060	saints row and everything, he, um, a while back actually announced that he was battling stage
7374060	7381260	four cancer. And unfortunately he succumbed to that cancer around the same time as the
7381260	7388620	announcement of the saints row reboot. Uh, he was actually solely working on saints row two and
7388620	7394300	trying to, um, bring that game back to a playable state. Cause you may, I don't know if you knew,
7394300	7400060	but the PC version of saints row two was horribly rushed and broken, like completely broken.
7400060	7406140	Pretty sure you've bitched about it on this show. Yeah. So apparently, you know, he, he was able to,
7406140	7411980	uh, work on that game and actually was able to recover the source code for the game to be able
7411980	7416540	to actually, you know, do a lot of things for it. And so now there's lots of different mods for it
7416540	7420860	and lots of patches, you know, the gentleman of the row was something that he had put out
7420860	7426860	and, uh, worked on for a long time that made the game actually playable. And unfortunately now,
7427900	7432540	you know, it's like kind of one of the last, you know, people that was really kind of behind the
7432540	7438620	whole saints row series and kind of leading in the right direction. But, you know, it's unfortunate
7438620	7443740	they had to pass away. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to hear that for, um, his family and, you know,
7443740	7450700	all the community that, uh, appreciated his contributions, um, to the game. So, um, yeah,
7450700	7457820	that's, uh, it's unfortunate. So, all right. Yeah. Well, to try to end things on a bit of a lighter
7457820	7464060	positive note tonight, um, I thought we could take this on as our last, um, uh, slight slated story
7464060	7470060	tonight, and that is a good old fashioned, make you feel old story. And you can probably read it
7470060	7474060	right there on the sidebar. Oh, but if in the podcast, no, you can't read it. So let me tell
7474060	7479900	you and inform you and give you your, your old moment. You ready? How old were you when the super
7479900	7488380	Nintendo came out? Because add 30 to it and it's your age. Now the super Nintendo turned 30 years
7488380	7495580	old this week. Uh, the super Nintendo, of course, uh, launched back in 1991,
7496540	7500780	if you can believe it. And I don't think it launched with a lot of games at the start. I know,
7500780	7507740	um, uh, Oh, by the way, and I should point out the super Famicom came out in November, 1990,
7507740	7513420	the U S launch was, uh, uh, in the last weekend of August, right before all the kids go back to
7513420	7523820	school, uh, in 1991. And I believe the launch games were pilot wings, F zero and Mario world.
7524460	7529020	And that was it, even though, even though some of the early trailers and some of the, you know,
7529020	7537900	like, um, I didn't realize this, did you know, Paul Rudd, the ageless man behind Ant-Man and,
7537900	7543820	uh, clueless the movie, you know, from, from very different decades, did you know Paul Rudd was in
7543820	7549420	that super early super Nintendo trailer? I didn't know that until I forgot it, I guess until this
7549420	7553180	week. But in that first super Nintendo, you know, they show a little bit of pilot wings. They show
7553180	7558140	a bit of Mario world, but they also show early footage from Zelda and some football game. I
7558140	7564540	think, uh, um, not, not the big football game, uh, super high impact. I think it did. Maybe it was,
7564540	7568780	I don't know. But anyway, um, they, they actually say in the trailer, these games are not out yet,
7568780	7574380	but the other ones, you know, work as pilot wings was a launch game. Um, I will say one of my
7574380	7579420	earliest memories of, of the super Nintendo. Um, I played it at a friend's house and I remember
7579420	7586940	playing pilot wings and I was just blown away by the use of 3d. Cause remember guys, it was the
7586940	7593180	early nineties. We didn't have like mode seven and what that gave us, which all mode seven is,
7593180	7599980	is basically the 3d manipulation of a sprite. If you look at a pilot wing stage, it's a bunch of
7599980	7605580	sprites strung together, but the way they rotate it and make it look, they make it look like a
7605580	7610140	fucking like actual, like that was the most like real life thing you'd seen at that point. That
7610140	7615020	was incredible experiencing that for the first time. And, uh, in case you forgot many people
7615020	7622780	remember, um, the, uh, airplane stuff and pilot wings in the skydiving, but don't forget pilot
7622780	7628620	wings in the later stages had that fun as hell rocket pack thing. You remember that there was
7628620	7633820	something they had the rocket pack. That was so awesome to play. Uh, and it wasn't really any of
7633820	7638220	the previous. So I think, I think that was it. I think it was the plane, the skydiving, the rocket
7638220	7643180	pack. And I think there was one other thing that showed up in some of the levels, but yeah. Uh,
7643180	7648380	and then quest Buster says I was playing F zero F zero was also an incredible use of mode seven.
7648380	7652620	If you think about it, those stages, all they are, are just a bunch of sprites together,
7652620	7661180	like lie down in a 3d form and it was incredible. So, um, yeah. Uh, those were really impressive
7661180	7665580	launch games and y'all know I stand F zero and I really wish they would release another F zero
7665580	7672220	game. Although I feel like Mario karts all we're going to get. Um, but, uh, those were some strong
7672220	7678300	launch games that did the Nintendo thing very well at showing off what the system could do.
7678300	7683740	And then Mario world of course, was just a rock fucking solid Mario game that showed off a lot
7683740	7688700	of cool stuff. It didn't show it off to the extent that pilot wings and F zero did. But, you know,
7688700	7693180	I think many people still remember that very first stage where the bullet that's like eight
7693180	7699580	times the size of Mario starts flying at you. And of course, Yoshi, right? Is that so, um,
7700460	7705900	and honestly that Mario game was so fucking good. Many people consider that the best Mario game.
7705900	7712620	Um, usually it's a tight race between Mario three, Mario world and Mario 64. And I think
7712620	7717660	a lot of it depends on your age and what Mario game you have memories with, but I digress. Um,
7719180	7722620	yes. Tiger class says another thing about pilot wings. When you make it far enough,
7722620	7726620	there was a level where you fly a helicopter, I think, and you were bombing some targets.
7727180	7732540	Yes. That was like a surprise twist, like way late in the game. Like you have to get all the
7732540	7737660	way to like stage seven or eight. You're right. You're right. Oh, Bobby Blackwell says no love
7737660	7743180	for Gradius three or SIM city where though that's right. SIM city was a launch title.
7743180	7747820	No, I have a lot of love for SIM city. Gradius three was good too. I didn't really honestly play
7747820	7753580	that one a lot when it launched, but that's right. SIM city was Nintendo's take on a rock
7753580	7759100	solid PC title. And that was where they had Dr. Right. Right. Based off will right. And you could
7759100	7764700	get the Bowser stat. No, it was Bowser instead of Godzilla. It was a Mario statue. It was a very,
7764700	7770300	it's it's honestly, I think it's the best port of SIM city, uh, next to the CD rom with SIM
7770300	7774700	city action news, which we've parodied on this show before. Uh, it's probably the second best
7774700	7780380	SIM city game. That's true. Uh, quest buster and chat says great music and Gradius three,
7780380	7785980	uh, sacred Jade says I still have SIM city for the SNES. I I'll stand it. Uh, and that's,
7785980	7791420	you know what it is. That version of the game has things no other versions of SIM city have.
7792460	7796140	So based on that Nintendo touch, so that is something to consider.
7796860	7801740	Um, yeah, ultra man on the SNES points out tiger claws, right? So there's,
7801740	7807180	it's just 30 years of memories on the super Nintendo. It was a good time. And honestly,
7807180	7811820	I don't know about you guys. I really think super Nintendo was just the best system they
7811820	7816060	ever put out. I th I still think the super Nintendo holds up stronger than even like the
7816060	7822300	PlayStation four or the X-Box. I just think the super Nintendo was it. And maybe that's my age
7822300	7829420	talking. I don't know. And maybe the turbo graphics in Japan, not in the U S so I don't
7829420	7834860	know. Or maybe it's just because my love for super, super Metroid is that deep, but y'all
7834860	7840620	that are going to respond with chrono trigger. Guess what? That was super Nintendo too.
7840620	7846540	So how many consoles can say they have both chrono trigger and super Metroid? I mean,
7847100	7852300	the galaxy is at peace when you consider both of those things were on the super Nintendo.
7853340	7858540	Um, let's see. Ooh. All right. Uh, let's see. Yeah. I still have that little bit of a cough.
7858540	7864380	Sorry. That's okay. Um, Bobby Blackwell, the chat says the chess master was the first SNES game
7864380	7871020	release, not on launch day. Really? I didn't realize that. Um, let's see. Uh, and Bobby
7871020	7875020	Blackwell says super Nintendo is my favorite console and I won't read his other comment.
7875020	7880940	He can go post that on Facebook gaming, uh, w four. He just sees dog in super Metroid.
7880940	7887180	Uh, w four says blockbuster with a bucket of popcorn specials. Oh yeah. Talking about renting
7887180	7892060	super Nintendo games. Hell yeah. When you go rent the super Nintendo games of blockbuster or
7892060	7895820	Hollywood video or whatever, and then yeah, you can get your bucket of popcorn and you know,
7895820	7902700	$4 candy. Absolutely. Ooh, quest buster with another great early title. Act raiser is another
7902700	7907260	great game that I'm a huge fan of. I stayed up all night playing that one. And you know what?
7907260	7913100	I can't think of a lot of things like Actraiser in gaming, maybe I guess, but see, I can think
7913100	7918220	of things that are like the SIM part of Actraiser, but the way that Actraiser really blended those
7918220	7923500	things together, I can't think of anything like that. Um, I know I've talked about it on the show
7923500	7928140	before, but, um, the game that I got, so I didn't get my super Nintendo on launch day. I think I
7928140	7933420	ended up getting it that holiday or maybe the next year, but my parents had no idea what game to get
7933420	7938140	me. So it came with super Mario world. And they said that the person at the counter at Montgomery
7938140	7941980	ward, where they got the super Nintendo, I think that was it or some of that recommended
7942620	7949980	that they get Draken, which was a PC game that they had ported to super Nintendo.
7950620	7957020	Um, it was okay. It did the, it did the 3d thing in an RPG environment, but I will say this,
7957580	7964300	the sequel dragons view is great. That was one of those blockbuster games. I read it because I was
7964300	7969660	like, eh, the first game was okay. I didn't love it. I did beat it eventually, but dragons view
7969660	7974620	two is fucking great because it does more like side scroll or action stuff. It kind of does the
7974620	7980700	act, act, razor thing a little bit actually. So there is that. All right. Uh, let's get to the
7980700	7984540	listener round table. So if you guys want to give us a call, you can head on over to the green room
7984540	7989980	over at vog network.com slash discord. Um, or we can do some emails, although I'm not sure we have
7989980	7996780	any tonight, but I'll ask over at, um, uh, participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Do we
7996780	8003260	have any emails tonight? Dark soccer. No, no. Just some spam. All right. Well, I don't want
8003260	8008140	spam. Send, send the spam back. Um, if you would like to send us an email in a future week,
8008140	8013500	participate at orange laundry.com is the place to do it. Uh, I didn't see anyone in the green room
8013500	8018860	either. Let me check in. Well, actually I will also open it up, uh, for folks in chat. Uh,
8018860	8022140	folks in chat are still talking about super Nintendo memories. Let me ask you guys,
8022140	8025580	I mentioned that like Mario world and Dracken were kind of like my first
8025580	8028620	super Nintendo games. What about you guys? What were like some of the first early super
8028620	8033500	Nintendo memories? Although dark soccer, you were, were you a Genesis household? I can't remember
8033500	8038460	how this went. I was a super Nintendo house. Okay. Dan had the Genesis. What were, Oh,
8038460	8044620	you were, you are the lucky kid on the block. Uh, I mean, after he and I got together long past
8044620	8049180	when I was a child. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, what were your, what were your early super Nintendo
8049180	8058940	memories? Um, playing home alone with my brothers, uh, kicking them out of actually
8058940	8063580	putting the super Nintendo in my bedroom and kicking them out so I can play legend of Zelda.
8065020	8071900	Um, lots of turn taking in super Mario world and trying to figure out blastress with the super
8071900	8079260	scope. We had a super scope. That's awesome. Yeah. Loki, what about you?
8081180	8086060	Um, I mean, I don't know. I had, there was privilege with my ex.
8087660	8092220	I had roadrunners death Valley rally. Cause that was the game I picked for some reason.
8092220	8097740	I think probably cause that was the only game that the store had with, cause I had sold my,
8097740	8105180	uh, Coleco vision and Nintendo to get a super Nintendo. And so I got, I think roadrunners
8105180	8109500	death Valley rally. And then I don't remember any other games I got, but I had a lot of friends.
8109500	8116700	I borrowed games from, so that's fine. Um, but yeah, probably that game. And then like,
8116700	8124460	you know, uh, link to the past and final fantasy six, you know, three, I guess. Um,
8125420	8130220	but yeah, those are probably the games I remember. Oh God, when final fantasy two came out, you know,
8130220	8136620	here in the U S uh, number four was number two in the U S um, uh, when that game came out, I,
8136620	8141660	I remember asking for that for Christmas and I got it and I know it was not a cheap game. Um,
8141660	8147180	and, uh, I played that so many hours I lost in that game. That game was incredible.
8147180	8151500	And then of course, when three came out, I lost a lot of hours in that one too. That's for sure.
8151500	8155260	But then I think like, God, the super Nintendo was the system that brought us street fighter.
8155260	8159020	Remember they released street fighter on the super Nintendo. And it really was
8159020	8164220	like for us at the time, it really was arcade perfect. Even though of course you go back
8164220	8167900	through another lens now and you kind of look at it and you go, eh, it did have its issues. Like
8167900	8173100	it wasn't quite as, as crisp as the arcade, but it was, it was, it was damn good. Yeah,
8173100	8179340	it was damn good. Um, we got it. What passed as arcade perfect back in the day, you know,
8179340	8184140	with like, you know, some of the stuff that was on earlier systems, I think that it was
8184140	8188220	acceptable, um, for that. And especially that in like moral combat or something.
8188220	8191980	I was just about to bring up mortal combat, which came out on good old mortal Monday,
8191980	8195340	because video games didn't seem to have a regular release day back in the day.
8195340	8199980	Mortal combat was also on the super Nintendo. Now I, I think a lot of people notice it did
8199980	8206060	move a little slug sluggish more, but the graphics were very good. Like it looked a
8206060	8211420	lot like the arcade version, except, Oh yeah, that whole issue with the sweat versus the blood.
8211420	8216140	And that was a huge deal back in the day was that, wow, this is arcade perfect. Except for one thing,
8218140	8222780	the thing that most of us associate mortal combat with, but that was, you know, that was the big
8222780	8227260	thing going on. Yeah, that's true. Then tiger claw points out when the original Mortal combat
8227260	8230700	came out on the super Nintendo, the first one wasn't perfect, but when they released mortal
8230700	8235100	combat two on the super Nintendo, this was the first time they had blood showing on the super
8235100	8240220	Nintendo. That's right. I keep forgetting mortal combat two came out on the super Nintendo, but
8240220	8245980	yeah, that was a really good, uh, translation of that game too. And yeah, I had the vote because
8245980	8253260	at that point, now you had the ratings were established. The ESRB was established.
8253260	8257900	So Nintendo was willing to put out those games now because they had those warning labels on them
8257900	8263740	and kind of that general system that was in the U S so yeah, mortal combat two had all that blood.
8263740	8269180	So, um, that was a pretty big deal. Mortal combat three then moved on to PlayStation. Um, I don't
8269180	8272220	think that ever came out on super Nintendo. Cause I think they kind of upped the, uh,
8273020	8277180	although I don't think the graphics were that much better than two, but I guess, I guess maybe the
8277180	8281260	stages when you like, cause moral combat three was when you could like knock somebody down under the
8281260	8285500	ground or up through the ceiling or whatever, things like that. So it kind of, um, did stuff
8285500	8290700	there. Oh, did it. Okay. Sorry. Sacred Jade said mortal combat three did come out for super Nintendo.
8290700	8295260	I guess I only remember it on PlayStation. So, all right. I see. I forgot about that one.
8296540	8301580	Interesting. But then mortal combat four went 3d. I know that one was a super Nintendo,
8301580	8307580	uh, Bobby Blackwolf and chap pointed out that a Frogger was the last release on the super Nintendo
8307580	8312620	and my brain went, Oh, they must've because that PlayStation Frogger was very popular
8312620	8315900	when it came out, they must've done a port for that for super Nintendo. Actually. No,
8315900	8322620	it turns out I, it was just a different type of Frogger game actually. So interesting.
8323900	8330380	All right. Um, let's go to any last minute stories that Loki might have tonight.
8331100	8336460	I don't have any. Oh, all right. We covered everything. Huh? All right. Let me see. Uh,
8336460	8340860	I'm going to go to our discord over at vog network.com slash discord. And I just want to
8340860	8345020	check in real quick because you guys post a lot of good stories throughout the week in the orange
8345020	8349820	lounge radio channel. So, Oh God, I saw this earlier today and this cracked me up. And maybe
8349820	8356940	you'd like this to Loki, uh, dungeon Buster posted in our discord, the no Skyrim mod.
8357580	8362300	And it does just what the name suggests. It stops you from playing Skyrim. When you
8362300	8371260	boot it up to start a new game, it simply won't let you know what a stupid idea, but I love it.
8371500	8378060	Okay. That's the mod for dark Sakura. No Skyrim. It's a, it's a mod called no Skyrim.
8378060	8382300	And that's exactly what the mod does is exactly that. When you try to start a new game of Skyrim,
8382300	8388620	it won't let you. Okay. How about I've never actually played through a whole game of Skyrim.
8390220	8394940	You should, you should try this one. Nobody has true. It's a very long game. Um,
8394940	8401020	time do I have for that? I've got, um, yeah. All right.
8401100	8407100	Um, let's see some other, uh, of stories that have been posted. Oh, I thought this was interesting.
8407100	8413900	Um, 13 X forever, um, posted a tweet, uh, that, uh, good old games updated five old
8413900	8419660	ask Konami titles on PC. But this also is a reminder. Some of these games reported to PC
8419660	8424540	and you may have forgot, including the Castlevania and Contra collection. I used to play that on
8424540	8429100	game tap just to not age myself too much, but maybe a little bit, uh, metal gear solid and
8429100	8434700	metal gear solid two silent hill for the room. I forgot that got a PC port, but it did.
8434700	8442300	And the original metal gear. I forgot that is based off the MSX version, not the Nintendo.
8442300	8446220	They actually translated the MSX version. So I didn't even realize that was something I could
8446220	8451740	buy. So I might get that. So yeah, they patched all those titles this week. Why? Because they
8451740	8457020	wanted to support modern controllers. So all of these games now support like PlayStation
8457020	8462220	controllers and Xbox one game pads and stuff. And the key bindings are a little different and
8462220	8467660	things like that. I thought that was really, uh, neat, uh, that those games, it was a good
8467660	8472540	reminder, like, Hey, if you want to play like the actual original metal gear, even though we
8472540	8478220	associate the NES version, a lot of times with that, uh, you can check that out on, um, uh,
8478220	8481180	that version of the game, which will now work with your current controller.
8481180	8488780	Um, awesome. Awesome. I think that I'll leave it at that for now. A lot of these other things you
8488780	8492060	guys posted, we did cover on the show at some point, but I thank you guys for bringing those
8492060	8497180	to our attention in discord anyway. And I think with that, we are towards the end of the show.
8497180	8500460	Um, so I'll go around and get final thoughts in just a moment, but first,
8500460	8504300	as always, I want to thank you guys for downloading orange lounge radio and participating
8504300	8508140	with the show, whether you did that live, you were downloading the video live as we were doing it,
8508220	8512460	or if you, uh, listen to us on the podcast feed later in the week, I really want to thank you for,
8512460	8516460	um, making orange launch radio part of your week. Um, I said at the top of the show,
8516460	8520300	I'll just remind everybody again, we will not be here next week over the labor day weekend. Um,
8520300	8524620	since I will be out of town and I think a lot of people have their own plans going on anyway. Um,
8525740	8529420	dark soccer will be streaming though. If you want to, if you want to still hang with, um,
8529420	8536380	somebody it's, it's the night for Debbie delight. All right. And, uh, I, I hope to, uh, come back
8536380	8540140	in a couple of weeks and talk a lot about some of the awesome things I heard at dragon con and
8540140	8544620	some of the panels hope to meet a lot of great people there. Um, if you enjoyed what you heard
8544620	8548300	here at orange launch radio, please help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show,
8548300	8552220	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put
8552220	8558300	out on air, what can we do? Um, so please help us spread the word. I'm an auto host for VOG network
8558300	8563900	here at Twitch goes a very long way. So thank you for everybody that does that. Um, you don't have
8563980	8568700	to, but if you want to, you can check out our shop, vog at network.com slash shop, and you can
8568700	8572860	pick up some, uh, good looking clothes for yourself to wear to conventions or wherever you like the
8572860	8577180	grocery shopping, wherever you want to take it, uh, such as, and I'm, I'm surprised nobody pointed
8577180	8582700	this out yet, but I will point out, I am wearing the Vaught. Well, dark soccer and Loki haven't
8582700	8586140	pointed it out because they can't actually see me unless they're watching the Twitch feedback.
8586140	8593580	Um, we have, okay. So I am wearing that new VOG network logo logo design. That's a little
8593580	8597980	bit like jet set radio or eighties ask, uh, the dark soccer put together a couple of months ago.
8597980	8601980	So I am wearing that new and you can check that out over at vog network.com slash shop. If you
8601980	8606700	want to, uh, after the show, I have to put this right back in the wash. So I have it ready for
8606700	8612540	Wednesday when I leave, uh, cause I want to wear this. I actually have like four VOG shirts for
8612540	8617740	the five days of dragon con, I guess Monday, I'm going to just wear normal clothes, I guess. So,
8617740	8622620	uh, yeah, there it is over at vog network.com slash shop. If you want to, uh, check out this
8622620	8625500	shirt that I'm wearing on the Twitch feed or for the podcast folks, you want to see what I'm
8625500	8630060	talking about. It's over there on the shop. Let's check that out. Yeah. There's all different styles
8630060	8635900	of the shirt. I like the baseball Jersey, even though the long sleeves aren't always awesome
8635900	8640300	for California. I will say it will be late in a couple of months when we're finally past the
8640300	8646540	summer. And I went to San Francisco today and this shirt was perfect because it's still easy breezy
8646540	8652300	in San Francisco. So there's that for sure. All right. Um, now we can get final thoughts
8652300	8656540	and dark soccer. I know you're going to head off to start, uh, the murder party. So, uh, what,
8656540	8661420	uh, is your final thought for us tonight? Um, don't be a dick.
8662780	8668300	Good call. I appreciate that. All right. Have a good one. Bye. Uh, let's see. My final thought
8668300	8676540	for tonight is, um, I just, I'm really looking forward to getting out of the house for the first
8676620	8683180	time since March and going on a trip. So, um, you know, obviously, uh, you know,
8683180	8688220	with the Delta variant and everything, I can't say I'm not a hundred percent nerve free,
8688220	8692780	but I appreciate that there are lots of people, including the convention taking precautions.
8693420	8699180	Um, and, um, I think that everything's going to be just fine. Um, but if you haven't been vaccinated
8699180	8706060	yet, uh, please do that. Uh, as you probably heard the Pfizer vaccine got the full FDA approval.
8706060	8710940	So if you were holding out on that, um, there, it went that there's your excuse. Uh, I still,
8710940	8715820	I still, it blows my mind how people are like, I don't want to take an experimental vaccine,
8715820	8720300	but I'll inject myself with animal drugs that haven't been proven to be used. I do not
8720300	8724940	understand that logic whatsoever on the animals. I understand I'm going to have political
8724940	8729580	differences with people. Um, but I would think those political differences would come down to
8729580	8734380	like, should the governor be recalled? And in my opinion, no, he shouldn't. And don't forget to
8734380	8738780	vote, but that's my opinion. And people are going to disagree with me there. At least I can
8738780	8744220	understand that disagreement a little more than I understand how the governor ticked people off
8744220	8750140	that one. I get a little more than I'm not going to take a vaccine. I'm going to inject myself
8750140	8755340	with a cow drug that I just, I don't get. So I don't, I don't know. I don't know when that
8755340	8762860	shit became political or why. Well, I, I do, but it should never have gotten that way. All right.
8762860	8766140	Anyway. Um, Loki, let's go to you last but not least in your final thought.
8766860	8772460	I played laser tag today. I'm surprised that the place isn't closed down yet. And they,
8772460	8779100	they actually, within the two years time that they had to fix all this stuff, they, um, did hardly
8779100	8785020	anything. So what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Uh, and Bobby does point out,
8785020	8788940	you did leave the house, Ida. Yeah. We missed a show. Cause I went out to Idaho one point. Yeah.
8789500	8794140	For me, that felt a lot different though. Cause I was going to like my friend's house. It's just my
8794140	8798780	friend's house was 10 hours away. I wasn't hanging out in like a big, big crowd of people, but I get
8798780	8804060	it fair point for a point. Uh, that's why. And somebody did get COVID after that trip.
8804060	8809820	So it might not be, it wasn't me, but it might not be the best comparison. Uh, entire call in
8809820	8815740	the chat says, uh, and don't forget to take a shower before going to the con. I take a shower
8816300	8822780	every morning, even during a convention. Thank you very much. I feel gross and sweaty if I don't
8822780	8827660	take a fricking shower in the morning. So I just, I can't, I can't live my con life like that.
8827660	8835100	Also. Uh, you all know by now that, uh, we, we, we splurge on a suite at dragon con. We,
8835100	8838700	we spend the extra money. It's don't worry. It's not the money we spend our own money,
8838700	8845180	Bobby black Wolf and myself on getting a suite at dragon con. And the reason why we do it is
8845180	8850780	so that it's like, we're not cramped in a room with four or five people. I've done that. I
8850780	8856460	know many of you still do that, but it's nice to just have space and just be like, I'm going to
8856460	8860780	just, you know, there's, there's not six people I'm trying to fight for the shower with. I can
8860780	8866220	do that. You know, it's, it's, it's very easy. Uh, and so we like doing the cons that way,
8866220	8871340	but if you didn't know, we were actually grandfathered into that suite by, uh, the
8871340	8877660	incredible Travis Donovan, formerly of understation live, um, who was a legacy
8877660	8883820	room holder at the Hyatt. And basically he kind of ended up transferring that cause he stopped
8883820	8887020	going to dragon con for a couple of years. He kind of transferred that to me. And that's where
8887020	8891580	the VOG network suite, uh, comes from. Yes. And Bobby Blackwell says your subs and bits do not
8891580	8896060	pay for the suite. Yes. I want to make that very clear. That is not what it is. Uh, legal fees and
