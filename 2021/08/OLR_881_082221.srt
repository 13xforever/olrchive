1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
25 years ago, years truly was downloading games via Zmodem, AOL channels, playing on

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,080
the Imagination Network somewhere around then too.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
I played Doom, I played Duke Nukem 3D, but then the brown medieval trappings of Quake

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,300
called my name.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
And now, 25 years later, I'm doing it all over again.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you know what?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,380
I am just fine with that.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,380
Or at least I will do it this week.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,960
It's been a busy weekend, okay?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,360
This is the end of the game on my two playlists.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,480
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,300
this anniversary and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,300
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:46,320
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 881

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,380
of our show for this August the 22nd of 2021.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,280
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm happy to be with you week after week here on Sunday

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,340
nights where we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,380
Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,420
And joining me as they do every week, except last week, but say hello to DarkSakra or Jamie

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
Summers.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,420
Hi.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Hi.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,460
I understand you haven't been feeling well, but I'm glad you're back.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Yeah.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,660
I had an upper respiratory infection and now it's a sinus infection.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:36,260
So I'm on some good antibiotics and hopefully I'll be back to normal in no time.

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,140
I feel a lot better than I did last week.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,740
Well, two things with that.

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,520
Number one, at least it wasn't the big C and number two, your wig looks marvelous.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,020
So it's a wig.

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,580
I bleached all this shit.

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Sorry.

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
Kidding.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
It's a wig.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
I don't wear wigs.

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Yes.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
I understand.

40
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
All right.

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,700
Oh.

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Oh, go ahead.

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Nothing.

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,700
I'll bring it up during my game.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
All right.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,420
Uh, say hello to somebody else who only wears their natural hair on this program.

47
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,480
Say hello to type master Loki.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
As little bit as I can.

49
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
I got a haircut.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,240
That's the reason I understand what I have to tell me it's too long.

51
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
What little bit is left?

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
You have to work with.

53
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,980
I understand that struggle very well.

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,840
Well, no, no, it's not going away.

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm making it go away.

56
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,100
I always buzz it so that I don't have to comb it.

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Must be nice.

58
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Can't relate.

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,100
Good thing.

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
I like hats.

61
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,060
I just, I'm just giving you crap.

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,040
What's what's the game playing behind you tonight, Loki, for those that are watching

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
live on Twitch?

64
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,140
Uh, one of the last greatest saints row games that there was saints row two, actually saints

65
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
row three.

66
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Wasn't bad.

67
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
We don't talk about saints row four though.

68
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
Yeah.

69
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Saints row three was a lot of fun.

70
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,260
Like I, again, I've said this before on the show.

71
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,520
I don't think I've ever laughed harder playing a video game than I did those opening moments

72
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
of saints row three.

73
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,780
Like, it's just so fucking funny.

74
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,460
Saints row three felt like the saints row that the writer's strike hit that like it

75
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,300
was pretty good, but then they made some really stupid decisions like story wise.

76
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,620
It's like, Hey, you know, that character that you're really liking is one of the best characters

77
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
in the game.

78
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Yeah.

79
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,620
We're going to kill them off in the beginning of the game.

80
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
Isn't that fun?

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Isn't that fun?

82
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,620
Don't you guys enjoy that?

83
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,540
Surprise.

84
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,500
So it's like the matrix online.

85
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Everything is led up to this.

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,440
Then they retcon that bullshit into a new game and then like they try to retcon it again.

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,980
Now they're retconning the whole thing, which is I'm totally cool with.

88
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
All right.

89
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,860
But we'll get to that later in the show.

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,660
First off, we're going to start off with tonight's kickoff topic, which is actually a little

91
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,820
bit more of a serious topic because it's a serious problem that's happening all over

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,180
Twitch and we need to talk about these hate raids that are occurring on Twitch.

93
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,900
It is a show about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,540
And this is certainly, unfortunately, a part of what gaming cultures become because Twitch

95
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,580
is so prevalent in our culture.

96
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,780
And unfortunately, it's affecting people's lifestyles.

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,620
So this qualifies for discussion on tonight's show.

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,460
And let's just be real, these hate raids suck.

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:14,660
They've been occurring 99.99% on a marginalized communities channel.

100
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,620
Unfortunately, some of the fear about all of these new tags may be used to harass certain

101
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,220
individuals certainly seems to be the case as we see several black streamers are getting

102
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,500
targeted with this.

103
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,700
Several trans streamers are getting targeted with this.

104
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Lots of folks across.

105
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Friends of mine.

106
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah.

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Oh yeah.

108
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:43,420
I was watching LC one night when this happened to him and he shut off the alerts as you usually

109
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,420
do and you know, all that stuff and you know, just try to play it off and acting normal,

110
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,620
but it's irritating, right?

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,900
Especially when, you know, sure, it's really easy to hit the button and stop this stuff

112
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
from happening.

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,980
I mean, heaven forbid it ever happened here at VoG network, but our policy, you know,

114
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,940
we have a plan if it were to happen here.

115
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,260
Number one is don't acknowledge it because that's what the folks want.

116
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,800
It is very easy for me to suddenly turn off the little bar at the bottom that shows everybody

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,900
who's following.

118
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,580
I think this is a good thing that ours is a little more subtle because we're recording

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,820
a podcast.

120
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,900
Most streamers don't do that.

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,360
They have little with a little name that comes up really big because they want to read it.

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,620
You know, thank you so and so for the follow, but the hate Raiders obviously exploit that

123
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,740
to try to get streamers to stay, say memes and you know, stupid jokes and things like

124
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,300
that, but we can turn that off relatively quickly.

125
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,180
And thankfully 90% of the time Bobby's here and he'll have this thing in sub mode in two

126
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,120
seconds and I'll have ads running in three seconds.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,640
So you know, unfortunately for those that don't subscribe to VoG network here on Twitch,

128
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,020
you will be inconvenienced a little bit and I apologize for that, but you can, I'm sure

129
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,020
you all understand if we have to hit the panic button because something like that's happening,

130
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,980
we're going to hit the panic button and it may be a little inconvenient.

131
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,140
It's inconvenient for us too, but we're, our, our top priority is, you know, making this

132
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,280
show that we're doing here.

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,180
But isn't it weird that I'm having to discuss, here's our plan, here's our thing that we're

134
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,880
going to do when it's Twitch at their level.

135
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,720
They've sent some tweets that are like, we're listening, we know it's a problem, it's unacceptable,

136
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,200
but I mean, it's still happening and what is Twitch is like, well, we can't tell you

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,120
what we're doing because then the Raiders, you know, are constantly working to circumvent

138
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
that.

139
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,520
Let that to an extent, but it really looks like you aren't doing anything Twitch.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:46,180
I mean, when people are continuing to get these raids, perhaps explain something that

141
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,240
you implemented that already got circumvented since it was already circumvented anyway.

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,840
You know, let people peek behind the curtain a little more because what I find fascinating

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,960
is that there's, you know, individual modders and people out there that are trying to help

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,640
the situation.

145
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,400
Somebody put together a script that would ban like all these usernames super fast and

146
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,060
things like that, which is, it helps.

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,160
But it's weird that Twitch isn't doing that.

148
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,800
Do you want to say something, Jamie?

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,280
Oh, I was going to say, Burban was talking about using that earlier today.

150
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,160
I was trying to get the link, but I had to hop out of his stream to come here.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Yeah, no, I understand.

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Loki, what were you going to say?

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,000
I was going to say, I don't understand what it is that they're doing that they feel that

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,840
they can't discuss it.

155
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,520
If it's going to be that easily circumvented, if they mention it like, then that's obviously

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,760
not the approach to take.

157
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,520
If it's going to be that easily circumvented, I mean, I don't understand what the problem

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
is.

159
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Well, and honestly, and I put this in a tweet and this is my honest to God feedback on this

160
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,520
whole thing is that Twitch, if you're serious about this, the easiest way you could counter

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,600
this today is disabled the ability to create a new account done.

162
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,960
And I know people are saying they're going, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of Twitch

163
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
money?

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
Yeah, they want money.

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
They want this growth.

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,120
Well, Twitch, clearly you can't handle the growth, Twitch, if you aren't able to deal

167
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
with this issue.

168
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,320
And I think an action like that, as drastic as it may seem, well, guess what?

169
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Twitch needs to show they're doing something drastic about the issues.

170
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Drastic times call for drastic measures, and I think they should disable the creation of

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,760
new accounts until they fix this.

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
All of you watching right now have an account.

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,740
And I would bet even the people listening on the podcast feed probably already have

174
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,000
an account.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,320
Most people that are going to participate in Twitch already have an account.

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,040
Now sure, there are people that aged 18 every day and maybe want to get on Twitch for the

177
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
first time.

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,720
I understand a couple weeks of inconvenience is going to be worth it in the long run.

179
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
And it'll, it would, it would be Twitch showing they're serious about this and they're trying

180
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
to do something about this.

181
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,780
And that's, that's the hill.

182
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,960
Is this the hill over here?

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
Because I'll go die on it.

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
This is what Twitch should do right now.

185
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,000
Disable the ability to create a new account.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,520
Or if you want to toss me the bare fucking minimum, you want to give me a little grass

187
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,280
on that hill, at least make it harder to make an account.

188
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Because right now it's not hard to make an account on Twitch.

189
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,420
And that's what the bots are exploiting.

190
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,940
You know, or look at the accounts that are being made.

191
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,620
If they're making like, you know, John Doe, one, two, three, John Doe, one, two, four,

192
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,680
John Doe, one, two, five.

193
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,500
If those three accounts are made in like a five minute span, the system should be able

194
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,380
to detect that something's afoot and like stop that immediately.

195
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:46,300
So I'll tell you something that happened with my stream at midnight that I had.

196
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,700
Is I kept seeing this thing like lunar underscore this, lunar underscore that, lunar underscore

197
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
this.

198
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,460
And it would happen like maybe every 20 minutes or so.

199
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,940
And thankfully, Finara was in there last night to help me with the ban hammer, but I was,

200
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:12,080
I had to ban them like the moment that they would come in and my, my, my channel is follower

201
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,200
only right now for, for chat.

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
And that's, and that's the bummer.

203
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,840
That's what most people are having to do, which sucks.

204
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,320
And you know, I'm sitting here talking about, well, our plan is I'm going to hit this button

205
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,120
that's going to fuck over anyone who doesn't pay us money.

206
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
And I hate that.

207
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,860
I hate that situation that we're in, but I'm going to do it to silence the hate if I have

208
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,800
to.

209
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,560
And I imagine there's a lot of people out there for their communities.

210
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
They don't want to do this.

211
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,800
They don't want to lessen the amount of people, legitimate people that can participate with

212
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
their community.

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,840
But Twitch is putting us in this position and what's pissing a lot of people off about

214
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,880
it is that Twitch takes half our income.

215
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Everybody knows that, right?

216
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,640
I say our income, like we're making a ton of money here at VoG network.

217
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
We're not.

218
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
We're pretty transparent.

219
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
We're tier one subs.

220
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Yeah.

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Yeah.

222
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
So tier one subs cost $5, right?

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,220
And the, the broadcaster gets $2 and 50 cents of that, that currency obviously varies from

224
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,700
country to country, but it's basically $5 or the equivalent and the broadcaster gets

225
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
half of it, two fifties.

226
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,620
That means Twitch is pocketing the other $2 and 50 cents for what?

227
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
The bandwidth.

228
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
Okay.

229
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,740
The, um, the brokerage of selling the ads, which, you know, we're going to come back

230
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,780
to that point in a minute and all this other stuff.

231
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Okay.

232
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
I get that.

233
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,020
But part of that is also creating a safe and secure place because we're bringing our communities

234
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
here.

235
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
Y'all want us to bleed purple, right?

236
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, it's also going a little bit beyond that too, because, um, people have had to

237
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:52,780
shut off, uh, uh, permanent discord invite links, um, which, um, I haven't, I had the

238
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,460
problem once and thankfully other people caught it and it was taken care of before I had to,

239
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,060
to deal with it too much.

240
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
And thank you everybody.

241
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
Thank you.

242
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,660
Actually, Mike Deft in chat who, who really was phenomenal and helping me, helping me

243
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
with that.

244
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,700
But they're going in and also finding those discord links and rating discord channels

245
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
as well.

246
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,980
Yup.

247
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,780
And uh, I'm not going to tell you specifically how the contingency plan works at VOG, but

248
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:26,060
we, we, we have a way to, uh, mix that up if we need to, you know, and, um, but it's

249
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
stupid.

250
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,860
Like we should, we shouldn't have to take these precautions in the first place.

251
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,820
Um, yeah, anyway, um, so what's being done about it, uh, from the user perspective?

252
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,700
Well, there's been calls for a day off Twitch basically, uh, and that's what it is.

253
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,940
Hashtag a day off Twitch, several streamers got together to say that they are going to

254
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,140
boycott Twitch on September 1st is the day of the big boycott.

255
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,580
Um, and, uh, that means don't watch it.

256
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
That means don't stream on it.

257
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,180
And I'll tell you, there's a lot extra convenient for me cause it's my anniversary.

258
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,380
Well, and you know, yeah, and for me, I'm going to be in the air on my way to dragon

259
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,580
con, so I wouldn't have really been able to participate anyway, but I'm still there in

260
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,780
spirit and actually go ahead.

261
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,740
I was going to say, I've, I've posted to take it a step further and turn off all of your

262
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,540
hosting, make your channel dead for the day.

263
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,220
I think that's a great idea, especially if you are hosting somebody and they are alive

264
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,600
on that day and should know better, you shouldn't be giving them the attention to for breaking

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
the boycott.

266
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,440
If a marginalized person who relies on Twitch for income wants to go live on September 1st

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,720
because they can't get by without it, I'm not going to judge that, but I'm not going

268
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
to judge that.

269
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,240
But I mean, most of the people that I have on my auto host, yeah, yeah, exactly.

270
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Most people don't fall in that category.

271
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Yeah.

272
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,240
Um, but I just, I kind of want to put the little parentheses like I, I fully support

273
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
the boycott parentheses, but I understand there are those who can't do it.

274
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,880
So, you know, and that whole thing, um, but, um, yeah, and, and actually something I suggested

275
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,120
on Twitter that, um, you know, I'm probably not the only person to think of this, but

276
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,720
I swear I thought of it all by myself and I'm going to pat myself on the back.

277
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,200
I think this is a great idea.

278
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,120
I think September 1st is a day you celebrate your community somewhere else, meaning don't

279
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
do Twitch.

280
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Why not?

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,300
This is the day that you create a YouTube or this is the day that you make a podcast.

282
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,880
This is the day that you get on your discord in a private channel because discord lets

283
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,380
you stream in there too.

284
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
And you stream to your community.

285
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
Lots of us have TikToks.

286
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
What's that?

287
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Lots of us have TikToks.

288
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Yeah.

289
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,380
TikToks.

290
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,460
So we'll put like highlight reels and stuff up.

291
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,620
In my opinion, it's more powerful to show ways that you can support your community without

292
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,360
Twitch, I think sends a bigger message in my opinion.

293
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,540
But that of course leads to this other discussion where a lot of people are like, well, I'm

294
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,940
just going to leave Twitch and go somewhere else to which I'm going to say, where, where

295
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,460
like there are, and I'm sorry, there's no big competitor to Twitch right now.

296
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,160
YouTube I guess, but you know, and there's all these other up and coming companies I've

297
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,960
heard of things like what is that Altair, Altair?

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,460
I've heard of other places and don't get me wrong.

299
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm rooting for these underdogs.

300
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,220
I'm rooting for them.

301
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,420
But here's the thing, Twitch makes it very easy to start making money.

302
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,020
So you know how I said earlier, half that money goes to them brokering ads and all that

303
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
stuff.

304
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Yeah.

305
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,860
Twitch makes it very easy to start making money on Twitch and the fact that they're

306
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,140
owned by Amazon kind of helps because if nothing else, Amazon's always going to step in there

307
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,760
to show, you know, Billie Eilish or whatever the hell's going on on Amazon prime right

308
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
now.

309
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,800
So the reality is, and again, many people are relying on Twitch for either supplemental

310
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,640
income or income, or even just the folks that are like, it's kind of fun to get a check

311
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,080
for $100 even if it's twice a year, if that, you know, it's kind of fun to see that happen.

312
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,360
And so it makes people a little bit hesitant to just jump off and go somewhere else.

313
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,080
So like we have to really like before we just say we're going to go somewhere else where

314
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,960
like who's built up to that level yet?

315
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,760
I mean, maybe YouTube, but even YouTube, I think it's a lot harder to make money on YouTube,

316
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,240
but once you kind of get in there, you can probably make a lot more to be honest.

317
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,520
Just depending on what level creator you are, just once you get in there, you know, yeah,

318
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,120
however many years that'll take.

319
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Right.

320
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,480
And so, you know, getting 50 followers and three viewers at a time, that isn't insurmountable.

321
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,600
That's very achievable for many people.

322
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,140
YouTube wants what, is it 10,000 followers on your channel now?

323
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
It's a lot.

324
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,980
It's 1000 subscribers and I can't remember the watch hours is, but it's like, you know,

325
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,700
a large amount of watch hours, 50 followers, 1000 followers.

326
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,620
Who's got the easier bar to get in there and make money?

327
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,660
We don't even have 1000 followers here on volume.

328
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,460
I certainly don't have that on my personal channel.

329
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,820
And that's also assuming that everything goes fine with YouTube.

330
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:15,840
It's just like randomly, hey, today we deleted your channel, you know, for a reason.

331
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,880
Hey, today we disabled monetization from your channel because you're putting out too much

332
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
content that is, your content is not engaging enough or something like that.

333
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,440
Or you're recycling content, even though you're not, you know, it's just plagued with bots,

334
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,480
different types of bots.

335
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,720
But also, you know, you have the problems with these large platforms that they are to

336
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,200
the size now where they can't automate, they basically can't regulate themselves using

337
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
people.

338
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,920
They have to rely on bots to do everything and the bots are stupid.

339
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
I agree.

340
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,660
And that's part of my issue with YouTube is that, and I've said this before, YouTube is

341
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,580
not very creator friendly.

342
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,500
They always side with bots.

343
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,140
And I don't know how I feel about that.

344
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
I don't, I don't love that.

345
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,380
And also like, yeah, the DMCA process too and copyright claims is just absolutely stupid.

346
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,740
It's like you get claimed by somebody, you dispute the claim and instead of a third party

347
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,640
looking at it, it's, it's up to the person that filed the claim to decide, Hey, you know,

348
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,340
do I still think that the claim is fair?

349
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,900
And I mean, if it's done in bad faith, I mean, you're really the only way you could possibly,

350
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,900
you know, do anything about it is to, you know, file another claim or like a final counterclaim

351
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,400
or something like that and take them to court.

352
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,980
I don't know.

353
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,380
It's very risky.

354
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,820
And a lot of these companies will throw around their, their weight as a big company, Activision,

355
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,860
for example, where they will, you know, copyright claim videos talking about, you know, the

356
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,820
new call of duty and leaking information about it.

357
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,860
Sorry that you don't like the information being leaked about your game, but it's not

358
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
game footage.

359
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,420
So you can, you know, what can you do?

360
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,900
You can go fix your own problems within your company and stop taking up your lead.

361
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,540
It's like, what are they going to do?

362
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,860
I mean, you could fight them in court, but it's like their Activision with billions of

363
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,300
dollars and legal teams and you're Joe, nobody.

364
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,940
So what are you gonna do?

365
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,180
All right, let's go to our chat room because of course I do want to get you guys and your

366
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,520
thoughts here on the show as well.

367
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,120
So over twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, let's all go to mixer.

368
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,920
You know, I think that I get that that comment has said tongue firmly planted in cheek, but

369
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,960
it also goes to show that any of these platforms where anybody is making a significant amount

370
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
of monetization could go away at any time.

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,960
And I think of our friends over at black compat who used to have a show at vog network years

372
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,680
ago called the electric sisterhood.

373
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,960
If you're not following their, their new rebrand here on twitch black compat, I urge you to

374
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
because they're fabulous.

375
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,400
But my point is they were on mixer and they built up on mixer.

376
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,920
And I think Bobby, correct me if I'm wrong, I think they were mixer partner or whatever the

377
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,360
equivalent is over there, because I know like they are very in like with Microsoft and

378
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,240
Xbox. And I think at least one of them is an Xbox, Xbox VIP, if not both.

379
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,200
So, you know, I know there's a lot of love there.

380
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,560
So them being a mixer made a lot of sense.

381
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,720
And then one day mixer shut down.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,920
And so they've had to rebuild over here on Twitch, which, you know, they've done a great

383
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,480
job, but it still sucks to have to build that up.

384
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,800
Thank you. Bobby says they were and only one is an MVP.

385
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,840
So sorry, I just I couldn't remember the terms and all that stuff.

386
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,760
But yes, I knew they were very engaged with the Xbox ecosystem.

387
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,480
So but yeah, I mean, you can all go away one day.

388
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,920
There's also just in Twitch in particular, this happened to one of my newer friends,

389
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,840
Fitness to Cosplay, I don't know if you've ever caught their channel.

390
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,280
That's a Twitter account that follows me.

391
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,080
I feel like I've seen that name before.

392
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah, really, really, really sweet person.

393
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:16,360
But at any rate, in trying to remove the the bots and all of the the, you know, various

394
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,280
raiders and things, they lost all of their followers.

395
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
They accidentally banned everybody.

396
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,600
Yeah, I've I've heard of this elsewhere, too.

397
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,960
So but it's they're not the only one that this has happened to either.

399
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm just going to throw that out there, too.

400
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,680
So this goes.

401
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,240
Broader than the consequence, I'd say the aftermath of it has been deeper.

402
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,640
So anyway, you know, I I'm participating, but I also am not actively participating on

403
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,080
September 1st, I'd love to create content on that day elsewhere, do like a stream in a

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,440
private discord or something, but unfortunately, I had already made plans for that day

405
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,840
and that's the day everybody decided.

406
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,560
So but I'm actively participating in spirit and I look forward to Twitch giving some more

407
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,040
details, maybe on that day as to what they're going to do about this and be, you know, a

408
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,480
little more than just we're listening, we're doing and just vague trees of some more

409
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,720
specifics. Honestly, I'm looking forward to that.

410
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,480
And my thoughts are with those folks that keep getting attacked with this bullshit.

411
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,760
Like it's just it's it's so stupid.

412
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
Like I just what is the point?

413
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,800
I don't even know what the I get, but I guess it's for the lols, as they say in some of the

414
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
darker parts of the Internet.

415
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,600
It's just silly. Nobody's laughing.

416
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,480
All right. Anyhow, let's let's go back to a little bit more pleasant of a topic and talk

417
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,560
about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

418
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
And how is your gaming week?

419
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,160
So Darsakura, we'll go to you.

420
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,000
How is your gaming week?

421
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,240
Um, I, I played Dead by Daylight, Fantasian Part Two came out, so I played that on

422
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,680
Tuesday, but my game froze.

423
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,720
So I guess maybe there's some bugs to work out.

424
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,600
But I lost my entire first battle, which was a long and fucking annoying battle.

425
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,040
So I will be, I guess, starting it over again on this upcoming Tuesday.

426
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
We are starting over.

427
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:32,120
Uh, I have made a new character on Final Fantasy 14 on Midgar Samara, so still on

428
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,560
Aether.

429
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,600
I wanted to go on Gilgamesh, but there's no room.

430
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,080
So now I have three characters on the same server.

431
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,760
Go fig.

432
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Um, I'm going to start off with a Thaumaturge this time.

433
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,840
A Dertmaturge?

434
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,520
A Dertmaturge.

435
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,600
Yeah, I'm playing a cat girl.

436
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:59,360
Um, and then, um, of course with Dead by Daylight, it, it took some money from me

437
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,040
because, and, um, I actually had wanted to put this in as a story, so I'll just go

438
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,880
ahead and say it now.

439
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,920
Um, the Dead by Daylight DLC is going away as, I'm not Dead by Daylight, but the

440
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,600
Stranger Things DLC is going away as of November 17th, 2021.

441
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,640
Dead by Daylight's closing finally.

442
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,160
Yay.

443
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,880
Good riddance.

444
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

445
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
I don't, I've met too many people.

446
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,560
And I think this is also coinciding with chapter 21, which is the Hellraiser

447
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,320
channel or channel chapter.

448
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,080
Um, and those pinhead mechanics.

449
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,800
Oh my God.

450
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,960
I've been watching people play.

451
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,600
I can't do the PTB on Stadia.

452
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
We got into it a little bit on last week's show, but we didn't have the

453
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
confirmation yet.

454
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,640
We just had that teaser video that made it very clear.

455
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,080
Pretty much.

456
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Yeah, pretty much.

457
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
But, um, yeah, now that we've gotten to see, I can't believe we didn't put it on

458
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,760
show world, but okay.

459
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,440
Um, now that we got to see it, I must've known you'd bring it up.

460
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,280
Uh, now that we got to see it on Tuesday on the PTB, yeah, it looks

461
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,520
like a really fun mechanic.

462
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,800
We'll go back into that in just a second, but let me finish this point.

463
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Um, and I actually have been for anyone who had this DLC on their wishlist.

464
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,240
I have been gifting it to people on Steam.

465
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,920
Um, but the, what this is going to do is it's going to remove the ability to buy

466
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:23,400
the characters of Demogorgon, Steve or Stoven, as we also call him, uh, and

467
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,560
broccoli, Nancy, I'm sorry, Nancy, um, in Dead by Daylight and the Hawkins level.

468
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,840
Now the Hawkins, uh, laboratory map is going to be completely removed.

469
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,640
It's going to be gone.

470
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,880
Bye-bye Hawkins.

471
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,840
Um, because technically nobody paid for that.

472
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
You can, you can play a match on Hawkins without buying a single

473
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,880
piece of Stranger Things DLC.

474
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,440
You're not paying for that technically.

475
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,920
Yeah, but, um, the characters are staying in the game.

476
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,720
Um, but right now, um, all of the characters themselves are available

477
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,160
at 50% off until November 17th.

478
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,600
Um, and all of their cosmetics are 50% off.

479
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,080
So, yeah, I, I bought everybody's cosmetics.

480
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,720
I don't play survivor, but now I can play broccoli and Nancy if I wanted to.

481
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,280
You know what broccoli Nancy is, right?

482
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,560
Oh yeah.

483
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,720
Yeah.

484
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,040
With the, with the particular hair with that hair.

485
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,440
Um, so, so yeah.

486
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,680
Um, and I actually got, sorry, just quickly on the stranger things

487
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,080
before we get off of that topic.

488
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,280
What is interesting about that is that, um, the stranger things three RPG game is

489
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,600
also coming off game pass on September 1st.

490
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,200
So yeah, it's a big license loss.

491
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah.

492
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
There's there's Netflix is doing something with the license and what a lot of people

493
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,040
are forecasting that something is ties into a story that came up a couple of

494
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,840
weeks ago on the show about how Netflix is getting into gaming on their own and

495
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,360
doing their own thing.

496
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,080
So the stranger things license would do a lot for their own type of

497
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,280
game and whatever they're doing.

498
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,320
I still don't understand why they had to pull it from dead by daylight.

499
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
Cause it's not like, you know, it's not like,

500
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,280
I know why they pulled it because, um, and it's exactly what behavior said.

501
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,520
The license ran out.

502
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,280
And so they didn't, but it isn't, you would think that the Halloween license

503
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,920
ran out by now, but they renew it, you know, so well, but Halloween also

504
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,360
doesn't have any other games except for a pinball table coming out.

505
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,080
True.

506
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,400
Um, and I can certainly see Netflix wanting to do some sort of brand

507
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,280
protection.

508
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,960
They want people to think when they think of a stranger things, video game,

509
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,600
anything having to do with the video game, they want to think of theirs.

510
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
It's controlling the market.

511
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
That's all it is.

512
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,840
It's controlling perception.

513
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
It's advertising end of story.

514
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,840
And there's probably things Netflix doesn't care for about Freddy getting to

515
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,320
put Steve on a hook and that the, the sort of, even though that's the things

516
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,880
the horror fans love and the fans of the game love is that it is all these, you

517
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,800
know, and, and I love the way you've described it, the characters aren't

518
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,240
leaving the game, but I was saying, I love the way you've described this on the

519
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,400
show before, and I use this with other people too, is that it's the, it's the

520
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,160
Marvel cinematic universe of horror and dead by daylight.

521
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
Um, and, um, it's, I call it the multiverse, the multiverse, whatever,

522
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,800
but yeah, which is actually the term because the Marvel cinematic universe

523
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,480
is part of the Marvel multiverse.

524
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,320
Got it.

525
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:30,080
So, and even like in the lore, if you read the observer's, uh, personal logs,

526
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,080
he talks about visiting various versions of Terra as he's calling earth.

527
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,360
And how the entity pulls from multiple realities and crap like that.

528
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,600
So, yeah, so it is a multiversal game at its core.

529
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,160
But, um, now I got into a talk.

530
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,800
I actually got to talk to one of my favorite, uh, YouTube folks, um,

531
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,720
luminous, who does those, uh, 3d, uh, dead by daylight parodies.

532
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
You know, the one where Meg has the weird voice.

533
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,280
No, I don't, I don't really watch these.

534
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
They're hilarious.

535
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
They're absolutely hilarious.

536
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,520
I'll link their, I'll link their channel in here, but we were talking a little

537
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,760
bit about, um, you know, I was like, I wonder if they're just going to reskin

538
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,160
the Hawkins map and maybe make it into the labyrinth and they were like, no,

539
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,080
it wouldn't be right if they did that.

540
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,480
And they probably wouldn't because something about asset usage or whatever.

541
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,040
Um, and I kind of now agree with that sentiment that I hope

542
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,680
that it doesn't happen.

543
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,880
You know, I want Hawkins to stay dead because I'm a killer main.

544
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Um, and I would like to see them do maybe a new map to replace it based

545
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,400
off of the labyrinth and how razor, and I kind of see them doing something

546
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,520
like that, we haven't heard if the DLC is just the hell priest.

547
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,480
It probably is, you know, in the, in the, it better be cheap as

548
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,880
fuck if it's one character.

549
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah, it's, it'll probably be like, you know, I guess like how Bubba was.

550
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Um, I saw an excellent, um, kind of proof of concept or whatever about

551
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,000
turning that Hawkins map into a recording studio for the tricksters lore.

552
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,440
Yeah.

553
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,720
Uh, and I really liked that because like all those little rooms upstairs

554
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,480
make a lot of sense.

555
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,360
The big lab could turn into like a padded wall type of studio.

556
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,360
You know, obviously it would take a lot of work, but I thought that

557
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
was a pretty clever rework.

558
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,080
Yeah.

559
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,320
The upstairs was all like offices.

560
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,840
Yeah.

561
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,120
Yeah.

562
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,480
But, but, you know, still make it make a lot of sense.

563
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,760
Yeah.

564
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,240
But I, but I agree.

565
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,320
I agree with, uh, luminous that, um, I don't think that it's going to be

566
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,840
reskinned and I think it might have to do something with asset ownage ownership,

567
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,320
but it could be that they might rework the general layout of it.

568
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,280
Like the bare bones of it into something else.

569
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,120
I mean, I would love for trickster to have, have his own map, you know,

570
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,000
trickster and Eugene to have their own map.

571
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,680
I would love to have the hell labyrinth.

572
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,840
We were also talking that it would be cool to have like DLC based off of like.

573
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,880
The classic vampire monster, because I mean, that's public domain.

574
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,040
You don't need the license like nose for not to, or, or Stoker license,

575
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,560
you know, cause I want to, I want a vampire killer.

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,200
Well, I was saying I would love to have just Castlevania.

577
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,760
They can tap on Konami again.

578
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,200
Oh, heck yeah.

579
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,880
But it wouldn't make sense to have your vampire killer with

580
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,320
no power to kill a vampire.

581
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,800
So, eh, but, um, but I was thinking.

582
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:44,280
It would be interesting to have, like, you have the classic vampire,

583
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,840
but they have the skin that's the Nosferatu style, you know, and then

584
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,600
they have like a, like maybe a Van Helsing, uh, or another vampire

585
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,680
hunter, like descendant who might not actually be a hunter, be the person

586
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,360
as a survivor and that we have like this Gothic castle, you know, cause

587
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,680
we gotta be down with our, our gothiness.

588
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm tired of goth Kate.

589
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,440
Enya's castle and all her cats.

590
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,960
No, no, but like there's a lamentable lack of goth.

591
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,440
I mean, there is Kate's little goth outfit, which is kind of, and then

592
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,720
there's, uh, Jeff, uh, in his aging death metal guar fan boy outfit.

593
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,080
Or, or stay with me here.

594
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,320
Picture this.

595
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,680
Sicily works.

596
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,480
Nine, 16, 20.

597
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,920
And we have, and we have vampires that are running around and they're sparkling.

598
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,040
It's the skin of a killer Bella.

599
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,680
Okay.

600
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,080
My wife has been watching the, the, the Twilight series again.

601
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,920
And it's just so stupid.

602
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,880
I don't, I don't give a fuck if Twilight DLC came out, I

603
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,240
would buy it in a heartbeat.

604
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,760
I would buy it in a heartbeat.

605
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,160
It would be so stupid and awesome.

606
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,520
Anyway.

607
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,760
But yeah, but going, going back to all of that.

608
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah, I got all of the cosmetics and everything for, for stove and Nancy.

609
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,600
I even have that terrible Jonathan Byers skin, which we will, he will

610
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,360
never get the Quint, the Quentin facelift, sad face, the Quentin facelift, by the way.

611
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,720
Looks great.

612
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm ace and woof.

613
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
And David has more chest hair now.

614
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,880
And I'm gay as hell and woof.

615
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,360
To this day, they nerfed the booty on pyramid head.

616
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,360
Just saying.

617
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,840
That was so funny.

618
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,000
That was a naturalist moment.

619
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,680
And you know, I can't call him pee head.

620
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,240
We can't really call him pee pee head anymore because there's

621
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,400
another pee pee head now cause pinhead.

622
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,320
Oh yeah.

623
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
Anyway, enough dead by daylight.

624
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,480
Oh, and I tried to get mass effect to run, um, through steam link.

625
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,160
Um, which is funny.

626
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:10,520
I actually got Gary's mod to run, um, through steam link because, uh, it's

627
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,400
32 bit on Mac, so it won't run.

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,920
Um, but I did steam link through my, uh, windows 10 arm through parallels.

629
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,720
And, um, I also got, um, source filmmaker to run.

630
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm going to be playing around with that on a project.

631
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,680
And, um, I, I played around in a little hot to full boyfriend.

632
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,760
Excellent.

633
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,000
So I actually did have a gaming week.

634
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,120
I've been sick as balls, but I did get some fun stuff done.

635
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,520
Sometimes that's when I'm able to get my gaming in is when I I'm sick

636
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,480
and I can't really do anything.

637
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

638
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,520
Who's who's got Nick related to in.

639
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,360
From Debbie delight.

640
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,040
Um, no Gottmik the drag queen.

641
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm looking at, let's see a Tabiri said he had in Gottmik had that pinhead.

642
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Look at the finale.

643
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,960
That's right.

644
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,400
That's right.

645
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,800
That's right.

646
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,120
That's right.

647
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,320
Yeah.

648
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,080
Okay.

649
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
So anyway, man, I love Gottmik.

650
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

651
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,280
Um, so it was mostly Minecraft.

652
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,440
I've been playing a lot of that and working on things.

653
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,080
Still haven't put out a video yet.

654
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,120
Been way behind stuff took longer as usual.

655
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,320
Um, and also your honor.

656
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,200
Yeah.

657
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,040
So like I wanted to, like, I had content that I filmed earlier in the week and

658
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,040
then it just wouldn't work with the order of which I wanted to do things.

659
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,000
So I have to refilm all of it.

660
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
I was going to do that last night.

661
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,160
And then the cat decided that she wants to sit here and

662
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,480
scream at me the entire time.

663
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,080
She has like a sixth sense, even though she can't hear of when I'm

664
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,840
about to record something and just sits there just screaming and screaming.

665
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,520
So yeah, that's fine.

666
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,440
But I actually did play another game this week.

667
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,760
Yes.

668
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,640
So there was a demo that came out for WarioWare get it together.

669
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,280
And so I did check that out on the switch because I do

670
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,320
like me some WarioWare games.

671
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,120
And it's all right.

672
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,400
I guess the games are fun.

673
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,720
Um, the, the thing this time is, you know, they have the co-op, they have different

674
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
characters, which control differently.

675
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,600
So it can make it a little bit of a challenge when you're playing like a

676
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,560
certain micro game as one character versus another.

677
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,160
So it's a little bit different.

678
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,160
It's not just like, um, you know, having to do the same

679
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
motions over and over again.

680
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,040
Um, so you have to figure out kind of how to do the same

681
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,080
thing with different characters.

682
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,240
So that's kind of cool, but like at the same time, some of the characters

683
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,960
are really annoying that I didn't really like them, but they'll probably

684
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,920
check it out when it comes out.

685
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,680
But it seemed a lot harder to me because of that mechanic they had in there.

686
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,440
Okay.

687
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,880
But I totally forgot that came out.

688
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,600
I have to try it.

689
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah.

690
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,640
It's, it's, it's all right.

691
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,320
I mean, it's pretty good.

692
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,440
Um, as you play it more, you unlock more characters and stuff like

693
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,920
that and get to check those out.

694
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Um, sounds like a pretty robust demo.

695
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,520
Yeah.

696
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:06,840
Yeah.

697
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,160
So definitely check that out.

698
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,480
And the game comes out like 10th or 10th.

699
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,840
So I'll, I'll probably pick it up anyways.

700
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,000
Um, I don't know.

701
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,520
Nice.

702
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah.

703
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,840
Nice.

704
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,480
All right.

705
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,680
All right.

706
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Yeah.

707
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960
Uh, then we'll talk a little bit about my gaming week.

708
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,160
First off, I want to make sure I plug, uh, the, the shirt that I'm wearing.

709
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I'm sorry, podcast folks.

710
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,280
You can't see the shirt, but I am actually tonight on Twitch wearing,

711
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,360
uh, one of our new newer shirts in the, I shouldn't say new.

712
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,800
It's been there a couple of months, but newer shirts in the store.

713
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,120
Uh, the orange lounge radio shirt that is Sega inspired.

714
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,680
The dark Sakura put together.

715
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,200
So, um, I have this and I bought also the, um, the new VOG network logo, or I

716
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,440
shouldn't say new cause it's not going to replace this, but like that, that

717
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,280
eighties esque, uh, the jet set radio looking, I'm going to call it that the

718
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,440
jet set radio looking VOG network logo.

719
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,520
I got that too.

720
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,840
And both I, I got to wear to dragon con.

721
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,000
If you want to check out the shirt, um, all you have to do is head over to

722
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,440
our store of vognetwork.com slash shop.

723
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,960
Um, As far as my gaming week, um, thank you for linking that in chat, by the

724
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,440
way, uh, and pixel pocket says I have the Sega styled OLR shirt as a tank.

725
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,200
Oh, that's awesome.

726
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,960
I wish I had the body for a tank top, but I don't, uh, maybe someday.

727
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,600
Um, so you know what?

728
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,040
Everybody has a body for a tank.

729
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,560
Yes.

730
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:19,840
Yes.

731
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,240
That's true.

732
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,160
I shouldn't, but you know, I, I, I just prefer to have my

733
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
sleeves covered with this one.

734
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,520
I like the baseball Jersey.

735
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,080
Anyway, you don't get a lot of like baseball Jersey custom shirts.

736
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,000
So I kind of like the streamlabs apps that, um, Anyway, my game of the week,

737
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
I totally forgot about the warrior wear demo.

738
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
I forgot the Diablo to have that open beta and y'all know, I love Diablo.

739
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,960
Now granted all the other stuff that's been going on.

740
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,800
Maybe that's why it's been kind of out of my head, but I didn't even think

741
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,280
to try it, which by the way, just a reminder, uh, the blizzard employees

742
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,040
have still not been responded to on their, uh, call of action, what

743
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,800
they are looking at from, uh, their bosses and their, uh, higher ups.

744
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,160
Just, just a reminder that still is not resolved.

745
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,080
And I will be mentioning that every week here on this program.

746
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,880
Uh, as I remember to, um, until it is resolved actually, um, As far as other

747
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,400
games I've been playing this week, um, I was continuing on in Hades.

748
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,880
Uh, I actually finally beat Hades, so I got the boss down, but here's the thing.

749
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,440
Once you beat Hades, the game has just begun because there is, there's

750
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,280
much more behind the curve, but I love that game.

751
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,080
It's so good.

752
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,480
Um, but it is, you know, the thing that gets really frustrating about

753
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,320
it is that even though, yes, the builds are really cool, how like you kind

754
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,560
of have to make new ones every time.

755
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,800
I really wish there was something that would let me rerun a particular build.

756
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,360
I just had like a, like a limited use item or something.

757
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,480
It would just be, it'd just be really nice, uh, to be able to do that.

758
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,920
Um, but I still love Hades.

759
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,400
Also been playing Final Fantasy 14 by daylight.

760
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,480
Um, not a lot of new stuff, although I did play a little bit of Haven, which

761
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,240
was a game that was on Xbox game pass.

762
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,360
Um, and that was a very stylish kind of game.

763
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,000
I was doing that just to get an achievement for one of the,

764
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,320
um, uh, little Xbox reward things.

765
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,680
Um, and then I was also trying to do it in grounded.

766
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,520
I actually probably played a little bit more grounded, you know, that game.

767
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
That's basically honey.

768
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,560
I shrunk the kids, the game, but they can't call it that.

769
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Um, where you actually play as kids that are in the back.

770
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,960
I didn't realize it was such a crafting heavy game.

771
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,480
Like it almost feels a bit Minecrafty to me.

772
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,120
Like what that game is all about.

773
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,240
So, um, it was neat though.

774
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,840
Um, I enjoyed what I was playing that, but unfortunately, um, it was, um.

775
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,440
It was really hard to get the achievements in that game.

776
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,160
They, they didn't really have any gimmies off the bat.

777
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
So, uh, yeah, I had to, I had to just do something.

778
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,640
It was going to be a little bit easier and then yes.

779
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,240
Um, SSU 100 Mountain Chat says, I keep getting distracted.

780
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,200
Quake came out this week and I had to play that.

781
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,320
Bobby Buckle says, I got to play Diablo two, but quake just came out.

782
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
I mean, what is this 1999?

783
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,080
Yeah.

784
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,080
Um, I also played a lot of that quake remaster.

785
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,280
I'll, I'll sit on my thoughts until we get to that story later in the show.

786
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,600
Cause I know it's coming up, but I did spend a bit of time on that

787
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,040
Quaker master and I will say.

788
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,440
If you got quake for free when Bethesda net was giving it away.

789
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,040
Do you remember that?

790
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,480
It was about, um, probably about, or was it even last year's quake con?

791
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,560
It might've been a year now.

792
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,760
It might've been last year's quake con.

793
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,400
They were giving away quake one, two, and three for free.

794
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,720
If you pick that up, guess what?

795
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,600
You got a free upgrade.

796
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,320
So, uh, I hope you all pick that up cause, uh, it was

797
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
definitely worth it this week.

798
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,240
Um, also really quickly, before we get into gaming news, I do want to

799
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
talk about dragon con a little bit.

800
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,560
So I'm going to be going to, um, dragon con on, uh, September.

801
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,680
I would say September 1st, but that's the day I fly out there.

802
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,520
The con itself starts the second and then runs through labor day.

803
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,120
Yes.

804
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,160
It's going to be a weird year.

805
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,440
Yes.

806
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,520
The Delta variant is very real and all this stuff.

807
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,160
Um, but I'm very happy that dragon con is taking a lot of precautions with it.

808
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,040
So masking is going to be mandatory, of course.

809
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,640
And they just announced this week.

810
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,600
You have to, they, they will be checking for vaccination or recent, like, uh, COVID

811
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,320
tests that is not like an over the cat.

812
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
There's very all sorts of parameters with it.

813
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,960
So basically, um, confirmation that you really don't have COVID.

814
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,960
Um, so I'm very happy for that.

815
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,120
So, uh, it's going to be half the attendance though.

816
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,600
Um, so I understand there's probably a lot of people who might sit

817
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,640
out this year and that's fine.

818
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,880
But if you are going to go.

819
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,000
I can finally tell you about the panels I'm going to be on.

820
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
I said, I wasn't going to announce them until they were in the Apple.

821
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,240
Guess what?

822
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,440
The app came out this week and all of my panels are in there.

823
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,360
So I'm going to quickly tell you what I'm doing at dragon con.

824
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,400
And I will also tell you which ones are streaming live.

825
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,880
Um, because for those that don't want to go, um, because of everything going

826
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,800
on in the world, um, you can still catch a lot of them live.

827
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,240
So, uh, first panel Friday, 1130 AM, these are all Eastern time video

828
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,480
didn't kill the radio star tips for doing an audio podcast on video

829
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,640
that will be streaming live.

830
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,120
Um, that's a panel Bobby and I pitched a couple of years ago that we've

831
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,640
done a few times now because we have this experience of taking this long

832
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,960
running audio show and moving it to Twitch.

833
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,280
And we kind of want to talk to other people that, um, are maybe looking

834
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,200
at doing something similar where they've been doing, uh, a lot of, uh,

835
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,960
audio stuff and they're going to make the move to video and we kind of

836
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,000
talk about some of the things we've learned from it and some of the

837
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,360
things we think are best practices.

838
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,840
Uh, yeah, and Bobby points out in chat, this is technically the VOG panel,

839
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
but we have guests on it.

840
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,080
It's not just Bobby and I, uh, I love this Friday at 1 PM on digital media.

841
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,400
This will also be streamed live.

842
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm going to be on a panel called neighborhoods over numbers.

843
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,760
These are people that enjoy broadcasting because of the communities

844
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,880
and the people they meet and they don't care about numbers so much.

845
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,600
If ever there was a panel meant for me, and this wasn't even my pitch,

846
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,960
I don't think, was it Bobby?

847
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,080
I don't even remember which fucking panels we pitched.

848
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,440
I don't think we pitched this.

849
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,280
I think somebody else did.

850
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,240
And I was like, Oh, I wish I had thought of that.

851
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,280
I should be on that panel.

852
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,480
So, um, neighborhoods over numbers, that's Friday at one o'clock.

853
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,600
Um, then over on the gaming track Friday at two 30 head canons, welcome

854
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,720
how games create personalized stories.

855
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,440
And I thought, Oh gosh, I get into Loki and Jamie's head

856
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,360
cannon so much here on this program.

857
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,440
This would be a great panel for me to moderate.

858
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,440
So we're going to do a panel on head cannons and, uh, the personalized

859
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,520
stories you take away from the game.

860
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,040
And I think a lot of the recent dead by daylight combo is really going to

861
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,120
kind of help in that particular arena.

862
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,000
Um, the pros and cons about being on a network.

863
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Uh, this is a very, they've done this on the digital media track.

864
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,800
A lot of times it's just about, should you network up with other

865
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,880
shows or, or, you know, other, um, you know, existing podcast networks or not.

866
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,960
So that'll be Friday at four o'clock.

867
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,120
I have a very, that's my fourth panel on Friday.

868
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
And, um, that's it.

869
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,080
I have four panels on Friday alone then on Sunday.

870
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,040
So I guess I have Saturday off.

871
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,400
I just realized I don't have a single panel on Saturday.

872
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,920
I really don't.

873
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,320
All right.

874
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,640
On Sunday, I have a panel called from inception to posting.

875
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,240
Let's get you published.

876
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,200
And this one is about, um, just the basic steps for how to

877
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,120
get your content out there.

878
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,880
So, um, I, I know a little bit about that, so we'll talk about that.

879
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,560
That is also going to be streaming live.

880
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,720
And then I have another panel called gender unlocked

881
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,920
character creation for everyone.

882
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:11,320
So that is Sunday at four o'clock where, uh, we'll talk about, uh, the character

883
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,240
creators with, uh, expanded gender expression and what games have done this

884
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,680
well and what games have missed the mark.

885
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,120
Now, Bobby, you're going to get a kick out of this.

886
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,880
Do you remember how you were saying you lost a panel?

887
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,720
I think I did too, because it's no longer in the app.

888
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,000
So unfortunately it looks like, ah, that's a bummer.

889
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,720
I was really looking forward to that one too, but unfortunately it's

890
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,080
no longer showing in the app.

891
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,280
So I guess I can't tell you about it.

892
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,160
Do you want to hear about it?

893
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,960
You want to know what the panel was?

894
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,840
I was really excited to do that.

895
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,080
Okay.

896
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm gonna tell you.

897
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,160
So I was supposed to be doing, it's not, I maybe, maybe it's just.

898
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:46,760
Yeah.

899
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,000
May I, it's not there.

900
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,160
So I'm left to assume it is canceled at this point, but if it comes back,

901
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,120
I'll let you know, um, it was going to be a ZeniMax panel and it was the art of

902
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,160
ZeniMax, ZeniMax, of course, being the company behind, um, Skyrim, Fallout.

903
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,920
I was going to be one of the artists.

904
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,800
So I imagine that artist probably pulled out of the show, unfortunately.

905
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,560
But I get it.

906
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,440
It is what it is.

907
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
Uh, oh man.

908
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,120
I was looking forward to that one, but yeah, that was, that was probably

909
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,240
going to be my biggest, my biggest panel.

910
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,040
That's all right.

911
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,520
Yeah.

912
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,000
Too bad.

913
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,880
But I understand.

914
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,440
So, so Bobby, it wasn't just you that, uh, lost a panel.

915
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,160
It happens.

916
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,560
It happens.

917
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,000
All right.

918
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,080
Uh, but that's my lineup for, so six panels at Dragon Con that I'm going

919
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,800
to be doing, uh, but I'm really excited.

920
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,360
And you know, with these, uh, celebrities that are dropping out and things

921
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,760
changing around a little bit, I imagine there will be a panel that shows up

922
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,720
that I don't know about, so we'll, uh, get to that, uh, I'll let you know

923
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,880
as soon as I know more about that.

924
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:44,600
All right.

925
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,400
Uh, let's move on and get into some gaming news and stuff that's going

926
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,200
around on around the gaming world.

927
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,000
So Loki, we'll start with you.

928
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,720
Cause I know you're excited about this.

929
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,720
I am very excited.

930
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:02,880
So yes, us, the, uh, saints row, uh, social media team has been teasing

931
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
an announcement coming this week.

932
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,600
Um, so they put out a, just a, a piece of graffiti show and Waltz does

933
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,200
rebooting and basically saying that saints row is being rebooted.

934
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,440
Uh, we're going to find out about it.

935
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,200
Thanks to Jeff Keeley's opening night games, calm show, uh, which is going to

936
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:30,200
be coming out, I think Wednesday, if I remember correctly, Wednesday at 11 AM,

937
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:37,080
uh, Pacific time, 2 PM Eastern time, uh, August 25th, so definitely

938
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,720
going to be tuning into that.

939
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,560
I am super excited to see what's coming.

940
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,680
I don't care if it's garbage.

941
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,040
A little bit care that if it's garbage, I don't want it to be like, you know,

942
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,320
agents of mayhem garbage, but it's pretty hard to, you know, not

943
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,000
give me the buy that game day one.

944
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,560
Now that said, if it sucks, sure.

945
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,480
I'll complain about it, but I'm still going to buy it day one.

946
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,080
And I mean, so absolutely.

947
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,920
We'll be picking this up.

948
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,000
I picked up all the other ones.

949
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,480
Why not?

950
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,640
Um, so yeah, that, that is something that's coming and hopefully we get

951
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,200
some announcements of remasters as well.

952
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,360
I know three was remastered while ago.

953
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,480
Two was being kind of worked on by one person.

954
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,160
Um, I think it was the idle ninja still working on that.

955
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,320
Um, so I don't know if that's ever going to be remastered or, you know,

956
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,640
I think he was porting over stuff or like fixing some bugs and stuff.

957
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,920
Cause they finally got the source code back, but yeah, I I'm, I'm down.

958
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,720
I just hope it's as crazy as three, not as crazy as four, four little too goofy.

959
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,280
Also too derivative of like the goddamn matrix.

960
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,960
Like, yeah, I get it.

961
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,640
Matrix is cool and all, but like, do we really need to do matrix

962
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,720
references this late in the game?

963
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,880
Um, please don't.

964
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,680
So I am curious to see what they do with that.

965
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,880
Cause honestly, like, I don't know, the grand theft auto, like I just can't go

966
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,320
in the grand theft auto online anymore.

967
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,800
It's just like, not for me anymore.

968
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,800
I don't know what happened to that.

969
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,280
Serious.

970
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,800
Mike Defton chat says, I don't know.

971
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,560
What's more funny.

972
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,680
Loki's cam doing the thing it does, or Rob trying to contain his laughter.

973
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,320
I can't help it when Loki's camera does that camera one, camera two, camera one.

974
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,800
It's just really funny to me, especially because this is such a big story.

975
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,840
I know he's really excited about that.

976
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,560
His computer's just deciding to go, did you mean to use this camera instead?

977
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,640
It's like, we get the distance.

978
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,640
I think it's the software.

979
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,240
It's just this X split V cam software keeps switching it.

980
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,160
Like it loses connection to the, to the camera, which obviously it's.

981
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,920
It works all the other times when I'm doing stuff, but for some reason

982
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,880
it's like, yeah, can't do it.

983
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,040
I love that.

984
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,560
All right.

985
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,360
Whatever.

986
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,120
Anyway.

987
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,520
Uh, so what do you think it's going to be like a redoing of one of the games?

988
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,760
Or do you think it's like a reboot for the whole franchise in general?

989
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,600
So technically it could still be sort of in Canon because, so.

990
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,120
Get out of hell, which was the last Saints Row game that they put out, which

991
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,080
is basically just kind of taking the Saints Row three or four engine again,

992
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,520
and doing yet another game with that.

993
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,320
Again, it's basically the same sort of game play.

994
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,880
Oh yeah.

995
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,720
The hell had like three different endings that you could pick from.

996
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,880
One of them was like rebooting the whole franchise.

997
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,320
Like one of them actually had them as cops, which is weird, but, um,

998
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,160
hold up, hold up, hold up.

999
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,640
So they had an ending where you chose basically one of three paths and that

1000
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,840
would like, so it's a rift on mass effect.

1001
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,560
I think.

1002
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:38,960
Yes.

1003
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,320
Okay.

1004
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,080
They're not fully the, the later games weren't full of original ideas.

1005
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,280
Unfortunately, um, no, that's like some of the other games were like, they

1006
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,280
started off like Saints Row was kind of like, I don't know if it was

1007
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,920
trying to take itself seriously.

1008
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,200
The first one took itself somewhat seriously and they did

1009
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,040
like some goofy stuff in there.

1010
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Um, but still we're going for like a grand theft auto vibe, which is totally fine.

1011
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,200
The two went a little bit more crazy and then they kind of did

1012
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,400
their own unique things with it.

1013
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,080
Like for example, they had like some mini games that were kind of unique,

1014
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,760
like septic Avenger, where you sprayed poop on things that was hilarious.

1015
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,440
Um, like the, the, uh, insurance fraud is always fun, you know, jumping

1016
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,560
in front of cars, ragdolling and stuff like that, like that, that's fun.

1017
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,000
And they even have like some fun, unique multiplayer, uh,

1018
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,720
components to the game as well.

1019
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,520
It was like the first game to have co-op gameplay throughout the storyline.

1020
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,880
Like you couldn't do that in grand theft auto four, you could play the whole

1021
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,400
storyline co-op and that's pretty awesome.

1022
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,960
Um, it also supported system link, which back in the day, like when you're doing

1023
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,680
land stuff, like that was absolutely fantastic grand theft auto four didn't

1024
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,520
support that and you can't even play through the storyline co-op now in

1025
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,760
grand theft auto five, I mean, granted now they have their own storyline and,

1026
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,720
and grand theft auto online, but like you, it's still not something you could have

1027
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,840
done and then three and four just kind of regurgitated the same stuff over and

1028
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,880
over again, like they just basically took the same missions, didn't even really like

1029
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,120
kind of get creative with the mini games so much, it was just like kind of, Ooh,

1030
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,520
we're ripping off Tron now.

1031
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,120
Ooh, we're ripping off the matrix.

1032
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,600
Ooh, we're ripping off mass effect.

1033
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,640
Like you could do a little bit, some nods and stuff and make it funny, but like,

1034
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,960
come on, like, I don't know, you can do way better than that.

1035
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,480
And so it just felt like kind of a rush job with some of these things.

1036
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,840
And I know that saints are a four wasn't supposed to be like the way it is.

1037
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,520
They had like the whole dominatrix thing.

1038
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,560
And then I think they even did like deleted like DLCs type stuff with it as

1039
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,520
well, but it was kind of a mess to be, to be honest, but like, I am very curious

1040
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,080
to see what a modern day saints road would look like in a modern day engine

1041
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,280
on next gen, you know, current gen.

1042
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,040
Um, systems and stuff.

1043
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,800
I really want to see what it looks like.

1044
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,400
Cause it's been a long time since we had a saints road game.

1045
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,120
It has been a little bit of the remasters.

1046
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,680
Yeah.

1047
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,240
Been a very long time.

1048
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,360
So, um, I'm very excited.

1049
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Yeah.

1050
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,920
I, I really can't wait.

1051
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,000
All right.

1052
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,160
Well, we'll see.

1053
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,160
I just, just think next episode of OLR, we have a new saints road

1054
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,200
game to talk about Loki.

1055
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,920
So we'll get all the details of games com be good.

1056
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,040
Especially if they do like a trailer in the trailer.

1057
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,680
Oh God.

1058
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,400
I hope they do a really good trailer for it.

1059
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,760
Like they do a three with like a power in the background.

1060
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,320
Oh, just chef's kiss.

1061
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,280
Like perfect.

1062
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,840
That was great.

1063
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,560
And even the mission that was perfect.

1064
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,520
Like, so saints road three gets so much stuff, right?

1065
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,720
But then they just like, there's also a lot of stuff that they get wrong with that.

1066
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,520
And I look, let's focus on what they do.

1067
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:46,840
Right.

1068
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,960
Let's let's go that way.

1069
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,400
All right.

1070
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,080
All right.

1071
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,600
Let's move on and talk about another series that gets people really amped up.

1072
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,600
That's Pokemon.

1073
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,440
Pokemon had a, a kind of a special little direct of their own this week.

1074
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,840
And we got some updates on brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.

1075
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,920
We got to see a little bit more of what those games look like.

1076
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,040
In fact, we also learned a little bit more about the grand underground.

1077
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,160
So it almost sounds like there's kind of like a, it kind of since things

1078
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,160
that sound a little bit like the wild area from the newer Pokemon games, but

1079
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,000
kind of like this underground area in these games, that could be very interesting.

1080
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,440
Also the super contest will come back as super contest shows and you can

1081
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,360
socialize with other trainers in the union room and you get to

1082
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,200
personalize your capsule decoration.

1083
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:29,600
So.

1084
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,080
Some of the features that'll be coming to that game.

1085
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,920
Also Pokemon home compatibility, which isn't surprising, but that'll come in 2022.

1086
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,160
Also a very special Nintendo switch light, Dialga and Palkia.

1087
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,080
Those special editions will be coming on Friday, November 5th.

1088
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,920
And yes, I saw that as Mike Deaf points out in chat, Pokemon contests equal

1089
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,200
Pokemon rhythm game.

1090
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,760
Yeah.

1091
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,720
That's, uh, that's what I've, uh, I've heard.

1092
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,560
Um, so I'm interested in that and checking that out.

1093
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,880
I'm actually, I feel like I'm more excited about these than Shane is.

1094
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,360
Cause I don't think Shane's a huge fan of gen four, uh, and he wasn't

1095
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,760
really big on the reboot, uh, the early stuff, I think he was a little

1096
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,000
more on board with the, uh, that was the impression I got from him after

1097
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,080
this direct, but I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm gonna play it.

1098
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,520
I'm gonna buy these games, bring them on.

1099
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,600
Uh, now a game that I know Shane is very excited about, and I'm excited

1100
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,880
about this one too, is Pokemon Legends Arceus, uh, and this is one where

1101
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,920
it's also in the Sinnoh region, but it's way in the past, it's not

1102
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,560
connected directly to any of the games.

1103
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Uh, and it has that mixed starter base, right?

1104
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,640
Where you can, uh, be Rowlet, Cyndaquil or Oshawott, uh, which is

1105
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,840
kind of neat that it mixes up the gens.

1106
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,720
And we found out in this presentation, there are kind of some new Pokemon

1107
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,480
in like that whole, you know how they do, like, there were Alolan

1108
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,600
Pokemon and Galar Pokemon.

1109
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,400
Well, now there's going to be, um, Suian.

1110
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,040
Uh, so like Braver, Bravery, Braviary, uh, has one.

1111
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,480
Growlithe has a very unique looking one too.

1112
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,800
So there's going to be some newish Pokemon in this as well.

1113
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,280
And then the other big announcement, uh, during the, uh, Pokemon direct

1114
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,720
was that Pokemon Unite will come out.

1115
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,280
Their MOBA will come out on mobile phones September 22nd.

1116
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,840
So enjoy that.

1117
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,680
And, uh, I guess there's some other little things too, if you want to

1118
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,080
talk about Pokemon Go and how weird it is that Gen 8 Pokemon are suddenly

1119
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,800
in the game when we did, we just skipped Gen 7 and went right to Gen 8.

1120
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,320
Um, okay.

1121
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,240
So, but not the starters, not the starters.

1122
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,920
I guess, I guess it's not legit until the starters are there, but, uh, still,

1123
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,080
it's still a little weird in that game right now, but okay.

1124
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,240
Um, but there you go.

1125
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,680
That was the Pokemon announcements.

1126
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:48,040
So, uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog and network, um, E3 VL and

1127
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,040
chat says disappointed it's the light edition and not regular switch or switch.

1128
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,920
Oh, led.

1129
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh, good observation that it's not the switch.

1130
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,640
Oh, led.

1131
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,920
I didn't even think of that, but yeah.

1132
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,440
So it's going to be a little bit of the older ones.

1133
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,880
So that's, um, that's too bad.

1134
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,400
All right.

1135
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,040
Speaking of the switch, I was going to say like our switch is having issues now.

1136
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,760
My, my doc, my, I had it, so I bought two docs.

1137
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,000
I had a doc that came with it.

1138
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,600
I bought another doc cause they originally I was playing on the switch

1139
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,080
near my PC to stream from it or whatever to like do gameplay capture.

1140
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,240
So I want a doc for that.

1141
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,520
So I had a spare just sitting around.

1142
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,680
So the first doc stopped charging the switch.

1143
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,760
I put the second doc down.

1144
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,320
Now it's starting to like the power light, certain of flash on it too.

1145
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,680
So it's dying as well.

1146
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,040
It's like, I don't know what it is when Nintendo hardware, at least

1147
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,080
in this, the switch generation, but it's not to the standard that previous

1148
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,560
generations have been, that's for sure.

1149
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,880
Mine spin just normal.

1150
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,800
I don't have that problem.

1151
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,240
That's weird.

1152
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,560
But I always, my switch is also also almost always sitting in that doc.

1153
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,520
So interesting.

1154
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,520
Yeah.

1155
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,480
Me going to dragon con will be the first time in a while that that thing

1156
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,000
is out of the doc for like a week.

1157
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,720
So it's interesting.

1158
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,080
All right.

1159
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,640
Well, moving on, keep mine docs all the time.

1160
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,760
So I, I, yeah, I'd say like 99% of the time my, uh, switch is docked.

1161
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,600
So I'm, I'm kind of shocked to hear that this is something that can happen.

1162
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,720
I can't imagine what would, what would happen if the doc stopped working?

1163
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,680
I'd be so mad.

1164
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,680
All right.

1165
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,800
Uh, moving on dark soccer, you have something for us.

1166
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,960
I do.

1167
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,200
And by the way, I forgot to mention something about this wig.

1168
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,480
This is for my Legion cosplay.

1169
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:25,800
Oh, random.

1170
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Okay.

1171
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,560
I didn't know that.

1172
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,200
Yeah.

1173
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,840
I'm going to be doing, uh, one of the Julie cosmetics.

1174
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:38,720
So I've got the white mask on order and you know, anyway, so yeah, neat preview.

1175
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,080
Anyway.

1176
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:46,840
Um, uh, I, I almost hate saying the company's name because it just

1177
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,880
leaves this bad taste in my mouth.

1178
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:58,480
It's it's, uh, but Activision is going to be omitting its logo from, uh, well,

1179
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,560
actually it already did it.

1180
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,040
It left their logo out of a call of duty trailer and said it was a creative choice.

1181
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:13,720
And I mean, it's almost a, a full omission of any reference to

1182
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,120
Activision as being any part of it.

1183
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,640
Um, it said it opened with call of duty presents instead of Activision presents.

1184
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,920
No logo, nothing.

1185
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,720
Um, the only mention of Activision is this is in the small print

1186
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,200
that, but this actually legally required.

1187
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,680
So, um, it also omitted its logo from the call of duty Vanguard pre-order page.

1188
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,960
Um, and there was a request for comment that was put forward and all they

1189
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,440
said was that it was a creative choice.

1190
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,040
But I mean, really, we know what this shit's about.

1191
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,680
We know exactly what this shit is about.

1192
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,480
They're in the, trying to distance from the, uh, uh, stuff

1193
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,320
that's in the media right now.

1194
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,080
And you know what?

1195
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,360
It's not going to work.

1196
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,360
Everyone knows that Activision is behind call of duty.

1197
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,040
Every Activision studio, literally every Activision

1198
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,480
studio is behind call of duty.

1199
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,080
Exactly.

1200
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,280
So, I mean, they made their bed time to light.

1201
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,520
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says most casuals don't, well, we're here to educate.

1202
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,720
Did you know Activision makes call of duty and it's that same company

1203
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,680
that's all in the news right now.

1204
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,880
So, all right.

1205
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,600
Uh, let's move on to another big game doing interesting things.

1206
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:34,920
Loki.

1207
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,280
I don't know.

1208
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,120
I don't think you're giving people enough credit, you know?

1209
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:40,840
All right.

1210
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,560
Loki.

1211
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,800
Yeah.

1212
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,000
So Epic Games is a big game.

1213
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,360
Loki.

1214
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:47,640
Yeah.

1215
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,680
So Epic Games has announced their totally original brand new, um, game mode that's

1216
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,920
coming to the Fortnite called imposters.

1217
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,680
Uh, it's a 10 player, uh, mode where you, I know this is going

1218
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,240
to sound completely unique.

1219
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,400
Um, you are trying to attempt who is trying to sabotage your

1220
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,280
team and vote the imposters out.

1221
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,720
Yeah, they ripped off, uh, among us.

1222
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,040
Well, what about those who would say that among us wasn't technically

1223
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,280
exactly an original idea, but I would, I would say it kind of goes back.

1224
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,360
Like, I almost feel like the thing that among us is based on is basically

1225
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,640
public domain at this point.

1226
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,640
Like it's one of those things where the, and I, I completely understand

1227
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,960
there are technically like books and card decks and stuff for the

1228
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,280
werewolf game, the mafia game.

1229
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,160
But the fact that like, there are so many variations of this same, you know, imposter

1230
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,680
vote them out type of game, um, I think just goes to show that, that, you know,

1231
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,040
that format is everywhere in many, many different forms, but I think the way

1232
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,600
that Epic has kind of implemented this.

1233
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,680
A lot of people are noting is, is pretty shameless.

1234
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:01,520
Like it is, it's, it's much more adjacent to among us than a simple imposter

1235
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,800
clone game ought to be, if that makes sense.

1236
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,160
It's very, it's very much like a quick kind of copy, you know, copy paste of it.

1237
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,080
Sure.

1238
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:18,160
It's in the, you know, aesthetics of, you know, Fortnite, but like, I mean,

1239
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,520
even like look at Fortnite, Fortnite's derivative as well of like, you know,

1240
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,000
the battle royale games, you know, basically just totally looked like,

1241
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,400
you know, player unknown was doing.

1242
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,680
Um, I don't know.

1243
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,640
Like, I think it's just really, really shitty.

1244
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:37,360
I'm considering that, you know, the one, of course, everyone wanted to know, well,

1245
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,520
what do the developers of among us think?

1246
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,160
And they basically said, listen, we didn't patent the mechanic.

1247
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,080
Um, they don't think it leads to a healthy game industry.

1248
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,880
Is it really hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?

1249
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,080
So like,

1250
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:56,840
So they didn't say we think it's shit, but they kind of alluded to it.

1251
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,600
Well, I'm sorry.

1252
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,360
This, this is somebody else coming in on, so Innersloth, yeah, they basically said,

1253
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,240
you know, that they, you know, patent to those mechanics, but like, yeah,

1254
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,440
there's other people.

1255
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,520
Um, yeah, so basically that was a comment by the Marcus Bromander,

1256
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,080
who was the co-founder of Innersloth.

1257
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,720
Um, but yeah, I agree.

1258
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,200
I think it is kind of dumb.

1259
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:30,440
Also the map that they have in the game is very similar to the among us,

1260
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,600
like the standard map in among us as well.

1261
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,680
So it's like, come on you guys.

1262
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,640
Like, can you make it a little less like that?

1263
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,240
I mean, you're a big company.

1264
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,640
It's like, can't you be satisfied with the money that you're making as it is with Fortnite?

1265
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,360
Do you really need to go start knocking off other games?

1266
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,840
Well, I guess they're kind of a little late to the party.

1267
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,280
I feel like, I feel like among us kind of already peaked and no disrespect to those

1268
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,080
developers who've had huge success and you know, all the deserved awards and recognition

1269
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,320
stuff, but I also kind of feel like among us in pop culture kind of already peaked.

1270
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,480
So I kind of feel like Epic is late to the party with this.

1271
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,440
And quite frankly, they deserve it.

1272
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,480
I just don't think it's going to take off, honestly.

1273
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,840
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't think it's going to take off very well.

1274
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,520
I think people will see it for what it is.

1275
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,240
Yeah, um, no, Ariana Grande was much more impactful to Epic than this will be.

1276
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,680
Yeah, I think that that's something more interesting.

1277
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,360
That's something unique that they're doing.

1278
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:29,000
Yeah, but it's like, oh, hey, we're going to rip off, you know, someone's game mode or whatever.

1279
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:30,960
That's fine.

1280
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,280
You can you can do like the whole thing, because like hell, I mean, even when we were playing like

1281
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,840
Q's are laser tag and stuff, they had a mode called spy that you had to figure out, you know,

1282
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,720
who was the spy didn't vote anybody out or anything like that.

1283
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,360
But it's it's similar to that.

1284
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:50,480
They could have taken like the espionage type of thing and done something unique with it.

1285
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,640
But instead, what they do, they just, hey, let's copy it among us and let's let's make it as

1286
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,360
let's make it legally distinct.

1287
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:06,480
Basically, as as as little as we need to do to make it distinct from among us, but keep it as close as possible.

1288
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,520
I mean, let's let's have them.

1289
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,000
Why not?

1290
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:15,720
Hey, you know, why not at this point, let's just have them rip off like, you know, other games as well.

1291
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,680
Where's our fall guys?

1292
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,800
You know, where's the obstacle course things for, you know, Fortnite?

1293
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,080
Why not?

1294
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:30,280
Let's jump on that bandwagon to going to chat E3 VL and chat says it's like fappy birds.

1295
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,280
I think you meant to say flappy birds, but we'll go with it.

1296
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,720
Where is the fappy bird mode in Fortnite?

1297
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,760
I think it's a good question.

1298
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,040
I guess I guess that kind of came and went.

1299
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,560
SSU 100 Matt in chat says the among us team is kind of that little engine that did.

1300
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,920
And this stings a little more that a big company is copying them.

1301
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,440
Also, the among us team is cute and super humble.

1302
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,880
Yeah. And I think that's exactly that.

1303
01:05:52,880 --> 01:06:07,600
I think that's why a lot of people are coming to the table kind of basically going like, yo, fuck Epic in this story, especially when, you know, Tim Sweeney tries and fails time and time again to bring this BDE to the table that he just doesn't have, you know, when it comes to.

1304
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:31,600
But Epic's the little guy taking on these other companies and it's like, you it almost kind of like, really, it really looks bad in the scope of like him trying to do that parody ad with Big Brother and all that stuff about we're taking on the big mean companies when it's like, the fuck are you doing to Inner Sloth right now, Tim Sweeney and company?

1305
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,200
Like, I think that's why there's a lot of people in this scenario that it's like, it's very transparent what Epic is doing.

1306
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,640
It's very shitty and fuck them with something hard and sandpapery, like, especially Tim Sweeney.

1307
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,280
I loved ZZT, but, um, you know what?

1308
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,120
That was a long time ago.

1309
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,440
It was a long, long time ago.

1310
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,480
You were a different person.

1311
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,520
I was a different person.

1312
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,360
You've changed.

1313
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,400
Uh, what's that?

1314
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,360
I said, oh, Rob.

1315
01:06:59,360 --> 01:06:59,840
Oh, me.

1316
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,120
Uh, E3VL says Sony tried to copy Smash.

1317
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,280
Didn't turn out that well.

1318
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,120
Actually, some people really defend the shit out of that game.

1319
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,720
And I get it.

1320
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,400
I do.

1321
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,600
Um, Tiger Claw in chat says, if you want a good game, you might as well copy from the best.

1322
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,200
Am I right?

1323
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,680
Um, that isn't instantly going to make it good though.

1324
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,800
I mean, I get where your like tongue and cheek comment comes from, but like that isn't going to make it good.

1325
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:28,840
But when games are a little bit derivative, um, some, and kind of do their own thing with it and bring new things to the table, I think they do very well.

1326
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,880
For example, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do something real close to home for Tiger Claw because I know where his fandoms lie.

1327
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,200
So let's talk about the Ninja Turtle arcade game by, by Konami.

1328
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,840
Now that game is an excellent game.

1329
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,680
Don't get me wrong.

1330
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,280
And why is that an excellent game?

1331
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:49,480
Because it took something like what you would see in a game like Final Fight by Capcom, which was huge in the genre at the time.

1332
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,280
But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles did its own thing.

1333
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,080
And it was that whole fact that you had the four characters that were all very distinctive.

1334
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:04,120
And who remembers when you were knocking shit at the screen and how like the, the enemies would hit the screen and there was like the item use it.

1335
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:04,880
But let's be real.

1336
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,960
The format is very similar to Final Fight and other games before it.

1337
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,640
I mean, Golden Axe, if you want, it was kind of a very similar type of thing.

1338
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:20,640
So sometimes you take a template from the best, but you improve on it in your own way.

1339
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,880
And that's why something like that is successful and where Fortnite could have been maybe a little more successful.

1340
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:33,280
But again, I think they kind of they kind of they kind of hit the genre after it after it passed.

1341
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1342
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,200
Tiger Claw brings up, to be fair, Final Fight wouldn't have been around if it wasn't for Double Dragon.

1343
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,680
You're you know what? You're right on that.

1344
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,640
I just happen to think of Final Fight first.

1345
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,480
But you're right. Double Dragon did it before.

1346
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:47,960
But there were, you know, was was Golden Axe before Double Dragon?

1347
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,720
I can't remember.

1348
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,840
But I know that that fighting genre has has evolved quite a ways, you know, over the years.

1349
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,240
So Double Dragon was eighty seven.

1350
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,680
OK, that probably was the first one then, because I think Golden Axe was eighty eight or eighty.

1351
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,440
I could be wrong, though. Golden Axe was eighty nine.

1352
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,400
Oh, wow. OK.

1353
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:19,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, we'll see how this Nickelodeon smash like fighting game goes.

1354
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,320
Folks are hyped about it, even though it's a copy of Smash with their IPs.

1355
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,360
Well, the the question is, will they do something different with it beyond just the characters?

1356
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,680
Obviously, will they be able to do something different with it?

1357
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,680
And will Lori Beth Denberg be playable?

1358
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:39,520
Yes or no? She better be the announcer, if nothing like if Lori Beth Denberg is not the announcer of this game, I reject it.

1359
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,360
Anyway, or or what was her name on guts?

1360
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,880
The referee, she had like a Moira Moira.

1361
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,480
That's it. She had like a New Zealand accent.

1362
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,440
Yes, Moira Moira could also be the announcer.

1363
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,200
And I didn't think she was from New Zealand.

1364
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,360
I think she was British.

1365
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,720
I thought she had a maybe.

1366
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,040
Oh, well, anyway, she was she definitely had an accent of some sort.

1367
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,440
I remember that. So. All right.

1368
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Anyhow, let's Moira Quirk.

1369
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,320
Where was she from? You got the Wiki up?

1370
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,680
I'm looking. She's from London.

1371
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,720
OK. All right. She's English.

1372
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,200
You got me. All right.

1373
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,480
DJ Rama S in chat says, have you been listening to Lori Beth's podcast?

1374
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,320
No, I haven't. And you brought that up before and I need to get on that.

1375
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,200
So I will correct that soon. My bad.

1376
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:34,080
All right, moving on, let's talk about an interesting history making moment overseas.

1377
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:39,000
The Nintendo Switch has swept Japan's game sales chart,

1378
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,400
meaning every entry in the top five is from switch.

1379
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,640
Actually, it's every entry in the top 10 is on this.

1380
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,160
Actually, it's every entry in the top 30.

1381
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,880
And that's where I'm going to end is a Nintendo switch up 30.

1382
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,800
The top 30 games are all on the Nintendo Switch in Japan right now.

1383
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,120
And that is up against the PlayStation five.

1384
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,840
That is up against the Xbox, Xbox in Japan. Come on.

1385
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,040
But that hasn't happened in 33 years.

1386
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,000
The last time that supposedly happened, November 1988,

1387
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,280
when the Famicom had the top 30 games.

1388
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,880
Now, keep in mind, Japan is not the US.

1389
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,360
So there are some differences.

1390
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,760
I think it's interesting that Minecraft is the top game in Japan right now.

1391
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,760
I mean, I get it, but it's it's interesting.

1392
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,200
But other games in the list are things like Skyward Sword, Mario Kart eight,

1393
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,080
Monster Hunter, Taiko no Tatsujin, Dragon Quest.

1394
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,200
Those are all the types of games you're seeing in the top 30 in Japan right now.

1395
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,640
Also, something that's been pointed out about Japan

1396
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,280
is that they are really in the peak of the pandemic right now.

1397
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,040
Whereas, you know, I think a lot of I mean, you know,

1398
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,280
with Delta or whatever, some could argue we're in a peak of the pandemic.

1399
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,160
But I think here in the US, you saw like peak pandemic culture shifts

1400
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,320
in like March, April, May, when it was first happening last year.

1401
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,960
And Japan's kind of going through that now.

1402
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,080
So some are saying that that's why the switch possibly is seeing a resurgence

1403
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,360
because of, you know, it's it's portability and, you know, all of that.

1404
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,800
So I think it's interesting.

1405
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,080
Also, I kind of just think with the PlayStation five

1406
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,520
being, you know, somewhat the newer system,

1407
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,440
but there's not a ton of games on it right now. Yes, there's some.

1408
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,640
I can see where it's probably slipped out of the top 30 for the moment.

1409
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,640
You know, because there's just not a new triple A title

1410
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,080
to really sell in Japan right now. So.

1411
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,000
Anyway, some comments in chat.

1412
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,120
Mike Deft says Taiko should be top 30 in US as well.

1413
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,720
Maybe someday. Maybe you got it.

1414
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,000
You got to just buy a lot more copies.

1415
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,040
Dartetsuya says, Oh, yeah, I hear Monster Hunter is huge over there.

1416
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,880
Dragon Quest, probably even more so. Yes, to both those things.

1417
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,040
Monster Quest and Dragon, Dragon, Dragon Hunter, Monster Quest, Dragon Hunter.

1418
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,400
Sure, whatever. Those games are huge in Japan.

1419
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,000
So. All right. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1420
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,800
Whale. So

1421
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,840
for fans of NetherRealm's fighting games,

1422
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,280
of which there are many because let's face it, their fighting games are good.

1423
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,720
But they're giving the priority to Mortal Combat 12 over Injustice three.

1424
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,600
And it makes sense.

1425
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,800
You know, Mortal Combat is the bigger name, I reckon, when it comes to.

1426
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,480
To IPs. And it really would make sense to me that they would do that.

1427
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,040
They know that it's going to make money, first of all,

1428
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,080
and they know that they don't need

1429
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,560
to focus on DC characters

1430
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:00,000
when they've got their own entire roster of characters

1431
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,320
that they can make the money off of. Right.

1432
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,560
I find the whole thing to be an injustice, quite frankly,

1433
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,200
because I like that fighting series. Really? Yes, really.

1434
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,600
I would like to see an Injustice three, but I get it.

1435
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,760
What is this all rooted in?

1436
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,000
Was there a tweet or something?

1437
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,120
Because some folks in chat are lighting up like, why did they confirm it in a

1438
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,640
yeah, there was a

1439
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,440
a giant bomb video

1440
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,480
that gives a lot of hints to

1441
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,840
another round focusing more on Mortal Combat 12.

1442
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,840
And also, I don't know, it just seems likely anyway,

1443
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,800
but I thought it was worth mentioning just because this also then might

1444
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,760
give a little bit of credence to them working on the next games.

1445
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,120
Johnny Woofay in our chat over at twitch.tv

1446
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,600
slash VOG Network has some things to say, including even if the story is true,

1447
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,360
you won't see a mainline Mortal Combat announced for at least four years.

1448
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,600
NRS or NetherRealm Studios is an active development of a new title right now,

1449
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,240
whatever that may be.

1450
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,840
Going on to say 11 can be fun in small bursts,

1451
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,480
but I got burned out really fast on it.

1452
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,600
And something new, it would be exciting, too.

1453
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,760
How about not a fighting game?

1454
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,040
How about a game that's nothing but sassing each other in those intro scenes?

1455
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,600
I mean, don't get me wrong, because honestly, that's why I care about it.

1456
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,680
Don't get me wrong.

1457
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,120
I love the fighting games that they produce,

1458
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,920
but I think it might be really fun to see them do something else.

1459
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,720
It's kind of like we need.

1460
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,560
We need a spinoff that's called Text from Cassie Cage.

1461
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,720
Johnny Woofay says The Grid, too.

1462
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,400
Fuck, yeah. Why not?

1463
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,880
Were you laughing or coughing or both?

1464
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,440
I was coughing.

1465
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,320
Yeah, so I'm interested to see whatever they come up with next.

1466
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,520
I also can understand that they probably would not want to bring out

1467
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,520
a Mortal Combat 12, certainly not this year or next probably next year, even.

1468
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,920
But I don't know if I would say four years in my crystal ball.

1469
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,720
I would say maybe 2023 for Mortal Combat 12,

1470
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,680
because that'll be about the time that PlayStation 5 and Xbox

1471
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,280
Series X are not seen as like new anymore.

1472
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,160
They're going to be like the standard.

1473
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,960
And so I think Mortal Combat 12 is probably going to build to that standard.

1474
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,080
And certainly the graphics and all that stuff are going to push to that level.

1475
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,920
And I think the frames you get out of it are going to be very powerful.

1476
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,880
Here's here's the other problem coming out of it, too.

1477
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,440
And now just between the two games

1478
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,360
and just as hadn't had a release since 2017, and I think it's due.

1479
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,120
But there's also the crap going on with AT&T

1480
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,800
because AT&T owns WB Games that owns NetherRealm.

1481
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,680
And AT&T put up its games division last year,

1482
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,360
like had bids from EA take to Microsoft Blizzard.

1483
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,320
There was no deal.

1484
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,920
But, you know, that's a lot of properties to go with it.

1485
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,120
So who knows if they're going to make another bid at it?

1486
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,000
I don't know what we're going to see.

1487
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,600
Well, time will tell.

1488
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,920
So but until then, we get rumors and lines to read in between.

1489
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,080
And it isn't just a Fleetwood Mac album. That's right.

1490
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,480
All right. Moving on, Logie.

1491
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,600
Yeah, so we've kind of talked a little bit about Epic Store

1492
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,760
adding some other like apps and stuff to the store.

1493
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,480
Remember, there was a whole thing with itch.io and that kind of thing.

1494
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,000
Well, now they're actually adding self-publishing.

1495
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,840
So you're going to be able to actually publish games onto the Epic Store

1496
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:57,360
similar to how you can on the Steam platform.

1497
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,800
Of course, with that, they don't want any pornography or illegal content,

1498
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,360
hateful discriminatory stuff.

1499
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,480
IP infringing things, you know, the normal type of thing.

1500
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,520
But right now it is in beta.

1501
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,200
I'm not sure what it's going to take to necessarily publish

1502
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,600
something on the platform, but it is interesting to see them open that up,

1503
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,400
especially when I think they were talking about how their platform

1504
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,000
is going to be more curated over Steam.

1505
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,040
But now it's going to be the same.

1506
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,320
So the same yet with less features.

1507
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,760
Have you guys been using the Epic Store at all?

1508
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,160
Like, I even forget to go in there and claim my free game anymore.

1509
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,480
I try to remember to claim my free games, but that's about it.

1510
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,200
I claimed Yooka-Laylee.

1511
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,760
Oh, I see. I think I missed that one.

1512
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,280
Damn it. I think it's still on.

1513
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,360
Is it? We have it on so many platforms.

1514
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,400
Like I have it on I have it on Steam. I have it on Twitch.

1515
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah, I think it's on Game Pass.

1516
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,920
Yeah. And Game Pass.

1517
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,760
Yeah, I mean, so it's like.

1518
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,280
I don't know. It's no big deal.

1519
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,560
I will say I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,

1520
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:05,760
but I was still using the Xbox cloud as a way to kind of like sample games

1521
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,560
without downloading them.

1522
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,600
That's actually how I played Haven and just giving props to the Xbox cloud.

1523
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,760
Like I enjoy it, just being able to pick up all these different games

1524
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,320
and just play them.

1525
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,480
And I imagine for Jamie, it's a very similar thing with Stadia

1526
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,200
and the games that they include in their their bundle.

1527
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,400
Like I've been very skeptical of cloud gaming, but I

1528
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,080
I'm starting to really see how that ease of really just bringing up a game

1529
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,520
and jumping right into it is really nice, even if it isn't quite

1530
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,360
the same graphical fidelity I would get if I'd install the game.

1531
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,120
But it's it's neat to see that technology kind of progressing.

1532
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,880
Again, I don't know how long I would use it.

1533
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,600
I certainly wouldn't play a game like FOM has 14 that I've spent

1534
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,200
hours and hours and hours on that way.

1535
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,120
But to dip in a quick game for 30 minutes or an hour, it's

1536
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,440
it's been kind of useful. So I'll give it that.

1537
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,120
All right. Moving on, let's talk about oh, let's talk about a game

1538
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,000
I'd rather just not have to download and just play it through the cloud,

1539
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,600
to be honest, which I guess a lot of people did on Stadia

1540
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,600
was Cyberpunk 2077, which just got a new patch.

1541
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,120
This is the biggest patch to date.

1542
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,200
They're saying it's the third major update since the original launch in December.

1543
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,600
Remember, remember Cyberpunk, everybody?

1544
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,440
Remember that game came out and it was it was it had some problems.

1545
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,840
Special. Yeah. So 1.3 is the new version now.

1546
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,040
They're talking about streaming and memory management.

1547
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,040
And now they're going to deliver some more things in it.

1548
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,280
So free DLC like cosmetic, cosmetic,

1549
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,240
cosmetic, excuse me, additions are included in this as well.

1550
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,960
There's also an alternative look for Johnny Silverhand, if you want that.

1551
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,520
And then lots and lots and lots of bug fixes, gameplay, UI,

1552
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,920
quests, things of that nature, being able to reset

1553
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,040
and reallocate perk points from the skill trees, all of that is available.

1554
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,800
Now, if you want to turn to other parts of the Internet and other people,

1555
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,040
amateurs, if you will, but I don't even know if I would say they're amateurs

1556
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,120
because a lot of these people do it very well.

1557
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,320
Professional modders at work putting their own spin on the game.

1558
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,960
And apparently there is a very well-known cyberpunk modder named Scissors

1559
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,760
one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one.

1560
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,880
I love that name. Just so we're clear.

1561
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,200
They released a gameplay rebalance mega mod.

1562
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,320
It's available on Nexus mods.

1563
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,520
And it you know, you check that out and it does a lot with the game.

1564
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,240
The the removal of scaling is a big part of it.

1565
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,360
So in the base game, V and the enemies gain stats as you level up.

1566
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,800
In this mod, they stop doing that,

1567
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,600
which is the way people some people prefer to play games.

1568
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,040
I prefer it that way.

1569
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,280
I don't like when the enemies level up when you do,

1570
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,000
because there's something very satisfying about overpowering them.

1571
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,720
But I guess that's a developer's artistic choice.

1572
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,400
But I think I would like to use this mod if I played the game.

1573
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,560
So that's that.

1574
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,560
Check that out if you are so inclined.

1575
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,760
Looking at some comments from chat.

1576
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,720
Sj100Matt says, I haven't touched Cyberpunk this year.

1577
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,680
Still have it, but waiting for the updates to fully pick it up again.

1578
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,360
Well, this might be the update to draw your attention,

1579
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,280
because it sounds like they have fixed an awful lot, that's for sure.

1580
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,160
So all right.

1581
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,200
And 5th Dream in chat points out a modder literally released this patch

1582
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,640
like a week before Project Red suddenly announced the official patch.

1583
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,320
Whoops.

1584
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,640
Anyway, let's go to our next segment,

1585
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:34,680
because I need to talk about some things that patching wasn't an option back then.

1586
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,440
So you all know this segment.

1587
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,080
Here we go.

1588
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:52,160
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

1589
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:56,480
where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1590
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,600
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1591
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,200
And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Soccer?

1592
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,080
I picked Arkanoid.

1593
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,000
And I don't even know why I picked Arkanoid.

1594
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,280
I was just like, man, what's something old?

1595
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:14,800
It's cool.

1596
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:22,480
Yeah, so Arkanoid came out in 1986 in July in Japan,

1597
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,720
US in August 1986, Europe just 1986 sometime.

1598
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,960
And it is a block breaker arcade game published by Taito.

1599
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,480
In the US, it was published by Romstar,

1600
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,760
who is not related to Homestar or Homsar.

1601
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:47,200
So you play this paddle spacecraft called the VAUS.

1602
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,720
And you basically have to clear out the blocks by basically bouncing a ball around.

1603
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,640
It's like one person pong with ball with a well, I mean, there's balls.

1604
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,720
There's always balls with blocks.

1605
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,920
Some blocks are indestructible, some may require multiple hits,

1606
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,560
but they are, it's kind of addictive and fun.

1607
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:17,960
The designers from Taito, Fujita Akira and Tsuji no Hiroshi,

1608
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:24,960
were expanding the concept put out by Atari's Breakout, which is very similar.

1609
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,920
And it was a part of a contest inside of Taito

1610
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,280
where two teams of designers would have to make a block breaker game

1611
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,480
and see which one was superior to the other.

1612
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,880
They also got inspiration from Tron with the games

1613
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,080
for the games neon-ish aesthetic.

1614
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,600
And so they designed the levels, they drew everything up.

1615
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:57,800
They did like different power ups and different goodies like that.

1616
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,760
And then they put out some play tests

1617
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,480
and it was actually better than they expected it to be.

1618
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,280
It went on to become a major success.

1619
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:17,560
It became the highest grossing table arcade cabinet of 1987 in Japan.

1620
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,520
And then there has just been so much more out of it.

1621
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,840
So let's go ahead and dig in a little bit.

1622
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,760
So I told you how you play it.

1623
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,520
You get like different add-ons, you get different power ups,

1624
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,280
different things that increase every new level,

1625
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,800
the various variations, formations, flying enemy ships, you name it.

1626
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,800
You can even expand the vase, add more balls.

1627
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:53,480
Have a laser cannon or break directly into the next level, an extra vase.

1628
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,320
But the gameplay is always the same.

1629
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:01,000
The final stage was just 33 on most versions and 36 on the NES.

1630
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:06,200
You fight the boss called DoH.

1631
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,360
And once you reach that, you no longer have the option

1632
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,640
to continue out of running out of lives, you play until you're dead.

1633
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,520
It's always game over.

1634
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,320
So apparently Tsuchino's,

1635
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:30,360
I guess, game developer name was Onijist, O-N-I-J-I-S-T.

1636
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,240
They were part of Taito's Yokohama Research Institute,

1637
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,600
and they basically participated in the contest and out it came.

1638
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,240
And Tsuchino was a big fan of Tron, so that's where a lot of that came in there.

1639
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:49,880
Basically, the geometric enemies

1640
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,800
and their power ups were actually hand drawn from 3D models

1641
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,480
and converted into sprite art.

1642
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,840
And then Okura Hisayoshi,

1643
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,800
who is the founder of Taito's house band,

1644
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,360
Izunata, did the game's music.

1645
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,120
Really short development cycle.

1646
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,320
It was described as murderous.

1647
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:19,880
There have been many conversions of various versions.

1648
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,360
We're talking about ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC,

1649
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,560
Commodore 64, BBC Micro, MSX, Atari 8-bit, Apple II,

1650
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,200
NES Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, IBM PC,

1651
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,120
a Mac version in 1987,

1652
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,960
a port for the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1989.

1653
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,600
All the computer ports were done by Imagine.

1654
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,240
The NES port came with a custom controller.

1655
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:53,040
And it really became one of Taito's most profitable games.

1656
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,800
It pulled money in hand over fist.

1657
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:03,920
It was compared in an issue of computer and video games in December 1986,

1658
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,720
where it was compared to Pong and Space Invaders

1659
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,880
in regards to simplicity and addictiveness,

1660
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:17,960
that it was also simple, colorful, fun, fast and addictive.

1661
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,600
And it has won the Silver Award from Gamest,

1662
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,760
Game of the Year from Compute Magazine, Best Arcade Translation.

1663
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,680
I mean, just all kinds of different things.

1664
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,880
As far as its legacy is concerned,

1665
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,640
there were a number of direct and indirect sequels.

1666
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,760
One of them was Tournament Arkanoid in 1987.

1667
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,360
It came out in the U.S. by Romstar.

1668
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,080
It was actually developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan,

1669
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,000
but it added new levels.

1670
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,960
There was Revenge of Dou, which is a true sequel with new gameplay mechanics.

1671
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,320
Came out in arcades in 1987.

1672
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,560
Arkanoid Dou It Again and Arkanoid Returns in 1997,

1673
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
followed by Arkanoid DS in 2007.

1674
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,880
Arkanoid Live was published on May 6, 2009 for Xbox Live Arcade.

1675
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:22,040
WiiWare got Arkanoid Plus and there is Arkanoid for iOS,

1676
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,080
which I have it on my phone. I love it.

1677
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,160
It's one of my time sinks.

1678
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,760
There is also a mashup called Arkanoid versus Space Invaders,

1679
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,320
and it came out in 2017 for iOS and Android.

1680
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,480
And that's it. Our game is Arkanoid.

1681
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,280
One that I have a lot of memories of, too.

1682
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,840
That special controller on the NES that I never had.

1683
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,120
But it looked like a lot of fun.

1684
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,880
Yeah, I like the one I'm watching right now is like the laser weapon

1685
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,160
because it was over if I got the laser weapon.

1686
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,120
Yeah, that's that's very much.

1687
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,120
Sorry, it's probably causing those listening on podcast

1688
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,240
like what is that pew pew pew noise I keep hearing?

1689
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,600
That's because they picked up the laser weapon in the game

1690
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,320
and they're just using that to really clear the board.

1691
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,600
This person is actually pretty good.

1692
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,040
Yeah, they're they're doing that.

1693
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,320
It's I bet it's Tass.

1694
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,160
It might be. I don't know. Yeah.

1695
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,600
So hey, not bad. Yeah. Well, there it is.

1696
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,840
Oh, man, they got the catch weapon now.

1697
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,240
I freaking love the catch weapon.

1698
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,360
I played a lot of that on the NES.

1699
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,840
I keep forgetting just how long that game has really lived on.

1700
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,160
I forgot about the Arkanoid versus Space Invaders thing.

1701
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,880
I wanted to play that. It looked interesting.

1702
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,800
So I just never got around to it.

1703
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,560
All right. Let's one day one day sequel.

1704
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,480
Let's do some rapid fire news.

1705
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,320
Let's talk about some other headlines, but quickly, Loki.

1706
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,680
It's happened.

1707
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,760
I know this is going to come as a shock, but.

1708
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,720
Skyrim is coming out.

1709
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,040
Again, that's right.

1710
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,640
The thesis announced that Skyrim, the anniversary edition.

1711
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,160
See, they can do this every single year now.

1712
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,000
Is coming out.

1713
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,440
It's basically the remastered edition that they had before.

1714
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,600
But now they're also including 500 Creator Club mods

1715
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,160
and some other things, as well as support for next gen consoles.

1716
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,040
That is going to be coming out November 11th.

1717
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:28,080
This year, I don't even know what else they could do for newer consoles,

1718
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,760
like I got to say, I played it'll look prettier.

1719
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,760
It already looks pretty fucking good on series X, like just because they

1720
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,480
enhanced it already for the one X when they released that.

1721
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,480
And it looks really good.

1722
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,160
So they're going to enhance it again.

1723
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,760
All right.

1724
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,080
The Creator Club content that they're putting a value on was all of.

1725
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,160
I don't know if it now they had.

1726
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:52,560
So these were the they're not mods there,

1727
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,840
but were I don't remember what they're calling them. Not mods.

1728
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,080
No, we're not charging for mods.

1729
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,280
That's that's ridiculous. It's micro DLC.

1730
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,720
So these are like little things that they put together.

1731
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:11,040
But also, I can't think that all 500 of those are necessarily Bethesda's

1732
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,040
micro DLCs or whatever they call them.

1733
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,920
A lot of it is user made content as well that were actually mods.

1734
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,480
There's probably something in the fine print that it's like if you put it here,

1735
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,240
we can get it in a compilation someday and they're fucking all those people over.

1736
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,800
I'm sure that's got to be part of it.

1737
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,320
Absolutely. Please enjoy your free copy of the game.

1738
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,800
You've already bought four times.

1739
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,240
Yeah. Yeah. Just like was it Warcraft remastered?

1740
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,720
Yeah. All the mods you make are ours.

1741
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,120
Signed exhibition.

1742
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:47,160
This is why. I'll probably play it, though.

1743
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,680
I'll still play it.

1744
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,960
I'm part of the problem and how.

1745
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:59,800
So there's that.

1746
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,680
And then speaking of older games coming back, as Robin mentioned,

1747
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:11,640
you know, Quake has been remastered and it's out now on all sorts of platforms.

1748
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:12,960
And it looks awesome.

1749
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,240
And it's got four K.

1750
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,720
It is awesome support in 120 FPS and all sorts of cool things.

1751
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,960
Plus mods. You don't have to pay for it.

1752
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:25,240
It plays fucking great on the series X,

1753
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,920
except for the fact that you're with a controller, which now look,

1754
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,760
I enjoy controller controllers a lot in some games, but like a shooter like Quake,

1755
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,040
you really have to have keyboard mouse for, in my opinion.

1756
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:41,080
So, yeah, I wish you could hook up a keyboard mouse to the light.

1757
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:43,840
Well, I think you can hook one up, but I don't think a lot of games support it.

1758
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,120
But maybe this one does.

1759
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,760
But as I alluded to earlier in the show,

1760
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,480
if you got that free quake that they gave away during the last Quake Con,

1761
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,360
they upgraded it to this version free.

1762
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,480
And so I did play a little bit of it on my PC.

1763
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,600
And I don't get to play a lot of 4K games on my PC because it's not like

1764
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,360
my graphics card can't quite handle it that well.

1765
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,840
And good luck trying to get a graphics card these days.

1766
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,320
So I just kind of stuck with what I have and

1767
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,880
but on what I have, it runs.

1768
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,520
Thankfully, Quake is an old ass game, so it runs smooth in 4K on my system.

1769
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,920
I like it a lot. Very pretty.

1770
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:23,000
So, D'Artesuya in chat says, I was shocked to learn about the free upgrade.

1771
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,480
I heard Modern Vintage Gamer was the one that wrote the new Quake,

1772
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,360
so I wonder if the Xbox One has keyboard mouse support.

1773
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,360
That would be lovely.

1774
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,800
But I haven't looked into it, to be quite honest.

1775
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,800
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1776
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,160
Well, we have something that makes me happy.

1777
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,880
Cat Lateral Damage Remiowstered is going to launch on

1778
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:54,360
September 15th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

1779
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:58,560
It better be on Mac as well, or else I will riot.

1780
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,120
But anyway, you can collect treats.

1781
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:11,000
You get the collect real cat photos and litter box mode, all that's there.

1782
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,440
Different progression redesign.

1783
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,440
But you find the cat treats as rewards for procedural mode.

1784
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:25,440
And the PlayStation 5 version has some special features that use the capabilities of the console,

1785
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,440
with 4K resolution, faster load times, increased render distance,

1786
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,440
and support for activities and game presets.

1787
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:36,440
And, of course, DualSense haptics.

1788
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,440
So, yay.

1789
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:46,880
And then the other is, absolutely, the moment that I saw it, I was at a loss.

1790
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,880
Sonny Chiba died due to COVID complications.

1791
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,880
And I had missed this news.

1792
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,320
And I was absolutely floored.

1793
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:06,320
I mean, I grew up watching, you know, a lot of Sonny Chiba movies.

1794
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:12,320
And, you know, I just was, you know, he always played the tough guy or the bad guy

1795
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:16,320
and the one who would just hit everyone, like, extra hard.

1796
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,320
Like, I know there was one movie where he, like, punched,

1797
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,320
like, his character punched him in the face.

1798
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:29,760
That it sort of invented the x-ray view of the skull breaking that Mortal Kombat bit off of.

1799
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:40,760
But, I mean, his stage name in Japan was Chiba Shinichi.

1800
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,760
He was born Maeda Asada-ho.

1801
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:49,760
And he studied under the same name as Chiba Shinichi.

1802
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:57,200
And he studied under one of the great karate masters.

1803
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,200
And he was a master himself.

1804
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,200
He could do anything.

1805
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:09,200
His nickname was, I mean, he actually didn't get to show any of his skills until 1973

1806
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,200
where he was in the film Karate Kiba.

1807
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Of course, he was in Kill Bill.

1808
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,200
He was in the...

1809
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,200
This whole crowd knows him from Kill Bill.

1810
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:22,640
The early years of OLR were heavily influenced by that movie.

1811
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,640
We were quoting it left and right.

1812
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,640
We had parody commercials based on that movie.

1813
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,640
So, you know, we all saw that movie multiple times.

1814
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,640
There's more.

1815
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:40,640
But he did influence Tarantino films, especially with the 1993 film True Romance.

1816
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:50,080
He also was in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift playing a Yakuza boss.

1817
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:59,080
But he was doing a lot more in Japan.

1818
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:05,080
And he actually had another movie in the works.

1819
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,520
I mean, he basically...

1820
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:16,520
His movies were the blueprints for a lot of our current hyper-violent martial arts movies.

1821
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:25,520
One of his roles where he played Tsurugi Takuma, he ripped throats out with his bare hands.

1822
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,520
And he could kill adversaries with a pencil.

1823
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,960
I'm actually just reading through some of these other examples.

1824
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,960
And I remember watching a lot of this, because like I said,

1825
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,960
I watched a lot of the Sonny Chiba movies when I was a kid.

1826
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,960
So, yeah.

1827
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,960
It's a loss.

1828
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,960
And shoot, at 82, still a pretty good-looking man.

1829
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,960
Well, fuck COVID, that's for sure.

1830
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,960
I actually didn't realize it was because of COVID complications.

1831
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,960
And fuck anti-vaxxers.

1832
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,400
And pod culture and chat says, get the fucking shot.

1833
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,400
But I imagine it's not like we here in the States are in that situation

1834
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,400
where it is very easy to get the shot at this point.

1835
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,400
We couldn't have said this six months ago, but now it is very easy to get the shot.

1836
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,400
You just go get it.

1837
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,400
That I don't think is the case in every country right now.

1838
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,400
I think we are unique in that circumstance.

1839
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:29,400
In every state, even Alabama is being...

1840
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Alabama is defying national orders right now,

1841
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:35,840
and they're not distributing the vaccines the way that they're supposed to.

1842
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
It's absolutely ridiculous.

1843
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,840
And pod culture and chat says, I was speaking to people in general.

1844
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
Yeah, I get it.

1845
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
That wasn't a drag you or a call out type of thing.

1846
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,840
I'm just kind of reminding ourselves that not everywhere in the world

1847
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,840
can get vaccinated right now.

1848
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,840
So that is even more so why we should be doing it.

1849
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,840
But the good news is, I heard they're giving the Pfizer shot at least,

1850
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:03,280
the official OK on Monday, whatever it had to meet to get that official

1851
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,280
will happen on Monday, it sounds like.

1852
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,280
And from there, now they can enforce a mandate on the vaccine and all that stuff.

1853
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:13,280
I'm sure Moderna won't be that far behind or J&J.

1854
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,280
It's just those vaccines came out a little bit later.

1855
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,280
So I think they have to be out on the market for so long.

1856
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:22,280
So yeah, get your vaccine.

1857
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,280
All right.

1858
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:30,720
And the real scary part is now you're hearing about people like Reverend Jesse Jackson

1859
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,720
and his wife were vaccinated and now they're still in the hospital.

1860
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,720
Unfortunately, that can happen.

1861
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,720
They're older.

1862
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,720
They're in their 80s, if I'm not mistaken.

1863
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,720
So it stinks.

1864
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,720
But yeah, it's just even more so like if only the people around them would have been vaccinated.

1865
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:51,720
But when you're a people person like the Reverend Jesse Jackson, you probably come in contact with a lot of unvaccinated folks.

1866
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,720
So it's unfortunate.

1867
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,160
All right.

1868
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,160
Let's move on.

1869
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:03,160
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things to play while you're at home isolating.

1870
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,160
Starting in the U.S., Loki.

1871
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,160
Yes.

1872
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:15,160
So this week we have Aliens Fireteam Elite on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

1873
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:21,160

01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:33,160
Murder Mystery Machine on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1876
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:40,160

1878
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,160

1879
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:58,160
Hajimari no Kizuki that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1880
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,160
We've got Spelunky and Spelunky 2 coming on Nintendo Switch as well.

1881
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:08,160
Baldo on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1882
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,160
No More Heroes 3 on Nintendo Switch.

1883
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:19,160
And we've got Tormented Souls on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

1884
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,160
That's it.

1885
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,160
All right. Well going over to Japan, we have a slightly bigger week now on the Switch.

1886
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:28,160
We've had some slow weeks, but there's quite a few games out this week on Japan.

1887
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,160
On the Nintendo Switch, King's Bounty 2 is out on the 24th.

1888
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,160
And then when you go ahead to the 26th, you get even more.

1889
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:38,160
Sukihime, A Piece of Blue Glass Moon in regular and limited edition.

1890
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:43,160
Kamisama no Yuunakimi-e comes out as well in a regular and limited edition.

1891
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:49,160
There's also a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Volume 1 from SNK that's out in Japan.

1892
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,160
Yeah, I thought that might get your attention.

1893
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,160
Oh, I heard about that, yeah.

1894
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,160
Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.

1895
01:42:54,160 --> 01:43:02,160
Let's see, it's SNK Gal Fighters, Samurai Shodown 2, King of Fighters R2, The Last Blade Beyond the Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact,

1896
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:08,160
SNK vs. Capcom, Metal Slug First and Second Mission, Dark Arms and Big Tournament Golf.

1897
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:12,160
And they actually put like a pocket station type of thing on your phone.

1898
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,160
Or sorry, not on your phone, on your Switch so you can kind of see.

1899
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,160
And there's like different ones that you can put on there.

1900
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:23,160
So this seems like something you might want to import Dark Sakura if they're not doing a release here locally.

1901
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,160
Which I don't know if they would.

1902
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:28,160
So anyway, that definitely has your name all over it.

1903
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,160
Yeah, it does.

1904
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,160
Even I cuddle with that.

1905
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,160
Let's see, we also have The Legend of Heroes.

1906
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:37,160
Hajimari no Kiseki comes out on the 26th as well.

1907
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:42,160
And we finally get a release of Destroy All Humans.

1908
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:46,160
And Alex Kidd in Miracle World Deluxe are also out this week.

1909
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,160
Even though those are in English, they are still at least releasing.

1910
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,160
On the Playstation 5, Hitman 3 is out of Japan.

1911
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,160
That is an English version.

1912
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,160
Along with that, Alex Kidd in Miracle World is out there as well.

1913
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:03,160
And Override 2, Super Mech League, Ultraman Deluxe Edition.

1914
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,160
Because of course, Ultraman.

1915
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Also out this week in Japan, Playstation 5.

1916
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,160
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1917
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:15,160
We have on the 24th Aliens Fireteam Elite.

1918
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,160
King's Bounty 2 as well.

1919
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:24,160
Also on the 24th is Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2.

1920
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:31,160
On the 27th we have Absalom End of Gods.

1921
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,160
American Fugitive.

1922
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,160
Tormented Souls.

1923
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,160
And that's it for this week.

1924
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,160
Alright.

1925
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,160
Just a few more stories for you guys.

1926
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,160
Then we're going to get to the listener round table.

1927
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,160
I mean just a few.

1928
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,160
I think we usually take about 5 or 6 stories.

1929
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,160
But we only have 3 left.

1930
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
It was a little bit of a slower news week, quite honestly.

1931
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,160
I mean there were some big headlines we've already kind of touched on.

1932
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:57,160
But overall, I feel like we're in a little bit of a lull right now in gaming.

1933
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,160
And I don't know if that's the pandemic.

1934
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:01,160
Is that the time of year coming up on Labor Day?

1935
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,160
Or what?

1936
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,160
Or all of the above, which is probably the real answer.

1937
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,160
So anyway, a few more stories for you guys.

1938
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,160
And we'll start it off with Loki.

1939
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:16,160
Yeah, so we have another story regarding the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

1940
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,160
No, we're not talking about Activision this time.

1941
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,160
We're talking about Riot Games.

1942
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:26,160
So Riot Games had basically run afoul of DFEH's.

1943
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:37,160
They had investigated them and apparently found that they were trying to bar individuals from filing complaints.

1944
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:41,160
Or assisting in DFEH cases.

1945
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:48,160
And basically also referring to the anti-retaliation, anti-interference provisions.

1946
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:56,160
And based on this, they're still kind of causing issues and dragging their heels.

1947
01:45:56,160 --> 01:46:07,160
I believe what this stems from, if I remember correctly, is that they were supposed to, after investigating some of the discrimination and harassment and stuff that was going on in the company.

1948
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:22,160
They were supposed to have been ordered to put out a communication to the employees regarding their rights as employees and how they can reach out if they've experienced any harassment and stuff like that.

1949
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:27,160
But apparently they have not done that yet.

1950
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:39,160
So the court ordered notice was to inform workers that they may freely cooperate, participate, and obtain potential relief if awarded in the DFEH's pending action.

1951
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:51,160
And that Riot Games cannot retaliate or take any adverse action against them for speaking to them or participating in any pending action or obtaining potential relief in such actions.

1952
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:54,160
So they haven't done that yet.

1953
01:46:54,160 --> 01:47:00,160
And this, I think, investigation began back in 2018, and they're still dragging their feet on it.

1954
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,160
Hmm.

1955
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:06,160
Kinsurian, that's just like a communication that they need to send out.

1956
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,160
What's the holdup here, Riot Games?

1957
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,160
You might want to click that send email button.

1958
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:13,160
Yeah, you're just asking for trouble now.

1959
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,160
Yeah, this is not a good look.

1960
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:19,160
And yeah, like S2100matt in chat says, why delay it if you have nothing to hide, Riot?

1961
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:30,160
Exactly. Yeah, so basically a court ordered Riot Games to produce, I guess, they were supposed to have put up this communication.

1962
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:38,160
And they ordered Riot to produce, I guess, them back in January 2021.

1963
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,160
However, they delayed production until April 2021.

1964
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:57,160
And then apparently, the settlement separation agreements or whatever that they were providing had some language in it that, you know, DFEH was not happy with.

1965
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:02,160
And so they were supposed to be correcting that, and they haven't done that yet.

1966
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,160
So, hmm.

1967
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,160
Guys, can't mess around with this stuff.

1968
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:19,160
Well, you know, it's like we were talking about with the Activision Blizzard issues a couple of weeks ago that, reminder, are actually still ongoing because, and I already said this once, but I'll say it again, the Blizzard employee requests have gone unresponded to.

1969
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:28,160
But when that was all first being talked about, we mentioned several times, you know, Blizzard and Activision are kind of the companies that the spotlight is shining on at the moment.

1970
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,160
But this is an industry problem.

1971
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:37,160
And, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of with Questbuster where it's like, oh, look, Riot Games is in trouble again. Surprised Pikachu phase.

1972
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:48,160
So, unfortunately, and I hate to sound so, hmm, la-di-da, about this, because it's serious allegations, but it's also one of those things where it's like, it's not the first time we've heard this out of Riot.

1973
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:52,160
So I don't think anybody's particularly surprised to hear this. It's extremely disappointing.

1974
01:48:52,160 --> 01:49:00,160
But on the other hand, it just goes to show this shittiness is in way too many places that are way too high up in the gaming industry, and it has to end, period.

1975
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:10,160
But I'm at least happy to see that our government and the courts are doing what they need to do. It's taken a long time to get here.

1976
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:15,160
But this is, again, one of those cases where when the companies can't fix themselves, I guess the government will have to do it.

1977
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:20,160
So you might want to click that send email button because it sounds like you have people's attentions.

1978
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:30,160
So, anyway, really quickly before I get into my next story, earlier I had mentioned I wonder what it is that's causing the slower Newsweek.

1979
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:38,160
A couple people have some explanations there. Mike Def says, next week is going to be filled with news, though, I think. I would agree.

1980
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:45,160
Bobby Blackwell says they're all prepping for PAX and Gamescom. Gamescom, yes, but who's going to PAX?

1981
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:54,160
I'm not reading because obviously Bobby and I are going to Dragon Con. It's all the same at this point as it is going to PAX.

1982
01:49:54,160 --> 01:50:00,160
But I mean what companies are going to PAX at this point? I haven't heard of a lot of exhibitors there.

1983
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:05,160
They're just now announcing the music guest. Okay, Bobby says he's joking about PAX.

1984
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:12,160
But I'm not. What companies are going to PAX? What's going to happen there at this point?

1985
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:21,160
So it's very interesting. All right. Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says a lot of exhibitors pulled out.

1986
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:28,160
Well, if nothing else, y'all, I'm getting a nice week vacation in Atlanta coming up, getting the hell out of town.

1987
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:37,160
It'll be nice. All right. Perhaps this will be a little more exciting, and that is EVO in 2022.

1988
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:42,160
EVO is going to be returning to Las Vegas. It was announced this week in 2022.

1989
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:49,160
EVO 2021, of course, was held online, but that was better than no EVO at all, which is what happened in 2020.

1990
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:58,160
So they did EVO 2021 online, and at the conclusion of it, they announced that EVO will be back in Las Vegas August 5th through 7th, 2022.

1991
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:05,160
Except they haven't said where yet, although most people are assuming it'll be at the Mandalay Bay Event Center, as it always has been.

1992
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:10,160
But I mean, again, a lot could have changed in the past couple of years.

1993
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:17,160
So, yeah, EVO 2022, it's also noted, will be the first in-person tournament since Sony bought them. Remember that?

1994
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:22,160
Sony owns EVO now. So it'll be interesting to see what that looks like when it's in person.

1995
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:28,160
You got to wonder if maybe some of those like PlayStation Experience, was that when it was PSX, the PlayStation Experience?

1996
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:34,160
If some of those elements will come back to like, you know, an in-person type of event.

1997
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:38,160
But we have literally a year until we find out what that really looks like.

1998
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:43,160
But they have announced that they are going to be aiming for that in person, which, of course, they are.

1999
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:49,160
I think we're all hopeful that this will be on its way out, and certainly in a year's time.

2000
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:55,160
Oh, who is this that just sat down? That's not the same person that was there before. Hold on.

2001
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,160
My shirt matches yours.

2002
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,160
Oh, you changed your shirt. I love it.

2003
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,160
Yeah, I changed my shirt.

2004
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,160
And you changed your wig for the podcast listeners.

2005
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,160
And my lipstick.

2006
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,160
Also like me.

2007
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:12,160
Honestly, this wig is a lot more comfortable, and I was starting to get a headache, so I switched out my wig.

2008
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,160
Or as Stark Tetsuya says in chat, new wig, who dis?

2009
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:18,160
Yeah, I do post that pretty often.

2010
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:25,160
All right, well, Dark Sakura, you also tell us stories pretty often here on the show, and we got our last story tonight from you.

2011
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:32,160
Yeah, so, well, it's dead, but not really.

2012
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,160
So Toys R Us is back in the news.

2013
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,160
Rise from your grave.

2014
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:43,160
We have risen from the grave, yeah.

2015
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:49,160
So now there's a partnership with Macy's.

2016
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:58,160
There's an organization that's also called True Kids Brand that bought the rights to Toys R Us.

2017
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:07,160
And then they partnered with a retailer called Beta, B-8-T-A, for small mall stores.

2018
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:12,160
But it kind of shows a little bit.

2019
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:15,160
There was one in Houston and one in Paramus.

2020
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,160
And then it closed.

2021
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:33,160
And actually, there were a bunch of sensors that would check the move and flow of people through to collect data and to see which display shoppers were most attracted to.

2022
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:40,160
But they didn't clarify exactly how it was being created, how long it was being stored for, so a big data problem.

2023
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:47,160
So after all of this, both locations closed, especially due to COVID-19.

2024
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:53,160
And now, True Kids has been acquired by WHP Global.

2025
01:53:53,160 --> 01:54:05,160
And now they've done a partnership with Macy's to use their online presence to sell toys under the Toys R Us branding.

2026
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:14,160
There is a site, it's not live yet, but Macy's dot com slash Toys R Us, all one word with no dashes.

2027
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:27,160
And then on top of that, they're going to be doing shop and shops inside, kind of like when you go to, what is it, JCPenney and there's like a Sephora in there.

2028
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:31,160
They're doing Toys R Us's like that inside of Macy's.

2029
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:42,160
And they're hoping to increase their holiday sales, because the last time they did something like this was in 2018 when they had an agreement with FAO Schwartz.

2030
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:48,160
Which, by the way, FAO Schwartz has stuff at Target now. That blew my mind. I just saw that this week.

2031
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:54,160
I was at Target and they had like the keyboard from Big, we all remember that, right, that movie.

2032
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:57,160
And there was other stuff like a magic set and things I guess FAO Schwartz was known for.

2033
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:02,160
They were selling it at Target and I was like, oh, that's where that ended up.

2034
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:07,160
I wonder where KB Toys is going to end up at the 99 cent store.

2035
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,160
Mm hmm. Who knows?

2036
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:16,160
All right. Johnny Woofay in chat says they turned our Toys R Us into a storage facility. Ah, sad face.

2037
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:23,160
I haven't seen what the buildings around here changed into. If anything, they're probably, they're probably haunted.

2038
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:29,160
Oh, Hobby Lobby. Gross. All right. Is that what the old birdcage one is?

2039
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:37,160
Yes, it's a Hobby Lobby, which doesn't make any sense because like literally like right behind it is a Michaels. Why?

2040
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,160
Anyway.

2041
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,160
Hobby Lobby is the devil anyway.

2042
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:46,160
As 200 Matt says, Dollar General. Yeah, just just what we need more of, dollar stores.

2043
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:51,160
And actually Dollar General Rob predates Dollar Tree.

2044
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:54,160
Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah, they're they're different.

2045
01:55:54,160 --> 01:56:00,160
Dejirama S points out the Toys R Us by me as a spirit Halloween. Oh, don't get me started on spirit Halloween.

2046
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:08,160
I mean, I love the store, but it's we all know the meme of building has become a spirit store.

2047
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:13,160
You know, it's silly. Bobby Blackwell says ours is a Burlington.

2048
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:17,160
Ours is a Burlington coat factory. Oh, now that that's a store I like.

2049
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:24,160
I like coats. Yeah, I like coats. I guess I've gotten some great coats at Burlington Coat Factory, so can't complain too much.

2050
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:28,160
All right. Anyway, we're going to get into the listener roundtable.

2051
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:34,160
If you would like to give us a call, join our discord, vog network dot com slash discord and hit up the green room channel.

2052
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:37,160
And we'll take some calls if anybody wants to call.

2053
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:42,160
We also use this opportunity to check in with our mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

2054
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:47,160
It's the place to send an email. I'm not sure we got any this week, but I'll look to dark soccer to confirm.

2055
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:51,160
OK, there it is. We got Jack and shit.

2056
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:56,160
Well, then you can also tell us in chat if there's something you'd like for us to talk about or what have you.

2057
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:00,160
But now everybody's talking about spirit Halloween.

2058
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:07,160
As 200 Matt says, the dead mall by me turned the now gone Saks Fifth Avenue into spirit Halloween.

2059
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:12,160
Wow. Wow. When a Saks turns into one, what a crazy shit.

2060
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:17,160
Well, I mean, I love spirit, but let's be real. It's a downgrade.

2061
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:22,160
Interesting. Bobby Blackwell says it was originally going to be a hobby lobby, but that fell through.

2062
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:28,160
So it's now a Burlington. Oh, interesting. Hobby Lobby is evil.

2063
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:33,160
Tiger Cost says, you know, another store that's gone Sears, you know, another store that's gone.

2064
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:41,160
Montgomery Ward. Sears last year was a spirit Halloween store.

2065
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:47,160
What was it? Oh, wow. Yeah, it was. But now that whole side of the whole mall is dead pretty much.

2066
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:52,160
I mean, like I was driving by it the other day and looking at it, it's just like there's no one there.

2067
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:57,160
I think I went inside there and like half the mall is closed off. It's just it's.

2068
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:05,160
Yeah, yikes. Because I think those those theaters are gone now.

2069
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:10,160
Oh, man. The discount theaters. Yeah. Lord knows what you're stepping in on the floor.

2070
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:16,160
The sign outside. Oh, God. Yeah. They saw the sign outside. But yeah, it's gone.

2071
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:21,160
They should. Somebody should just write in the marquee jokes like coming soon. Spirit Halloween store.

2072
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:27,160
People should do that. I don't understand. Anyway, we do have somebody waiting in the green room to come on the show,

2073
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:31,160
so we'll get to it and bring them in, invite them to talk to us.

2074
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:37,160
Hi there. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Pixel Pacas. Hey, Pixel Pacas.

2075
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:41,160
It is great to have you on the show. How are you doing? I'm doing well.

2076
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,160
Thanks. Loving the show as always. Well, thank you so much. Loving having you here.

2077
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:50,160
What's on your mind? So I just wanted to bring up some news that it's kind of a big deal to me.

2078
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:57,160
And some other folks might be interested as well. Sure. So in Banning, California, it's kind of just out there.

2079
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:04,160
Yeah. I know about this. Yeah. The Museum of Pinball is closing.

2080
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:11,160
Which is sad. I only got to go there once, though. Tons of pinball machines, also arcade machines.

2081
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:19,160
But the owners, they announced they're closing it like maybe this month. Is that the one in the Bay Area or the one in the desert?

2082
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,160
No, no. I thought it was the one in Alameda, Rob, when I told you. That one also closed.

2083
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,160
Well, they're not permanently closed. That's the Pacific Pinball Museum, I think.

2084
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:34,160
OK, so Banning's the one because I think there was a convention there. I was looking at it, looking into going.

2085
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:40,160
And it's down in, like, Palm Springs. OK, so it is kind of the desert.

2086
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,160
OK, sorry. Just had to get my geography straightened out. Sorry.

2087
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:51,160
Yeah, it's huge. It was like 40,000 square feet or something. Yeah, it's a big place.

2088
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:57,160
I regret never getting to go. There ain't a lot of there ain't a lot of shit to do in the desert.

2089
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:04,160
I mean, again, you had to explain to me very, very thoroughly where Banning, California was in the first place.

2090
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:11,160
Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing there except kind of an airport and a casino. But anyway, so they're closing.

2091
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:16,160
I got to go once. It was really cool. I'm sad that they're closing, but I mean, they couldn't do anything during COVID.

2092
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:22,160
Right. So I think that probably plays into it. They couldn't open. They couldn't do anything for over a year.

2093
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:28,160
But now they're going to be auctioning off everything. Oh, over 1000 machines.

2094
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:35,160
The auction's already open. Yeah, it's it's gonna be live, like starting September 10th.

2095
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:43,160
But you can register now. You can look. You can preview everything now. You can bid in person or online.

2096
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:47,160
I'm laughing because Alan's in the other room. And I started looking at it.

2097
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:52,160
He can hear it because he hears the playback here in the studio. So he's he's in the other room.

2098
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:59,160
I'm looking right at him going, baby Pac-Man, baby Pac-Man. I'm mouthing it. And he's like, no, we don't have the space.

2099
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:05,160
No. But Rob, what? Baby Pac-Man, you can keep it at my house.

2100
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:11,160
Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan. Rob can keep it at my house. Baby Pac-Man.

2101
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:19,160
There you go. Oh, he said fine. He relented. OK, yeah. And it'll get to live at my house.

2102
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:23,160
Now, we actually just switched out. We traded a temporary trade.

2103
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:30,160
We have the Rick and Morty table right now. We traded our Metallica temporarily.

2104
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:35,160
Nice. Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in to hear me scream baby Pac-Man in your face.

2105
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:39,160
Is there is there a machine that you're looking at getting in throughout all this or what do you think?

2106
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:44,160
I'm just looking at this point. You know, I would like a pinball machine. I don't have any at this point,

2107
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:52,160
but I would like to kind of get started in that world of take of arcade and pinball machines taking over my life.

2108
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:56,160
I'm ready. And your house? Yes, I'm ready.

2109
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:01,160
Dark Soccer, you should be giving away a free toaster that'll run Doom.

2110
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:05,160
Do you watch Jack Danger? I do.

2111
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:10,160
Cool. And actually talk to him. Message him sometime because he's really good with advice.

2112
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:16,160
Nice. Yeah. Sure. And there's a pin side. Good for him there.

2113
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:22,160
But there's also I think it's like road you pin is another group, I think.

2114
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:28,160
OK, I haven't heard of that one. I'll see if I can find it. But I think they're by Papa.

2115
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:34,160
The like Pacific arcade pinball something. So Bobby Blackwell is asking in chat,

2116
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:39,160
do they ship? Because I think he has a particular machine in mind. That's the thing.

2117
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:44,160
I think I'm pretty sure. Oh, I could have sent the link to you. I think you have to manage that yourself.

2118
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:48,160
They have some recommended shipping partners or whatever, but it's really up to you.

2119
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,160
I think they'll give you a pallet, but you've got to figure out how you're going to take that. Get that to you.

2120
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:57,160
Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, I think a pinball is not cheap.

2121
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:02,160
It is. Yeah. Who wants to rent a U-Haul and go down to Palm Springs with me?

2122
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:06,160
Dark Soccer, Loki. I'll do it. All right.

2123
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:10,160
Rob, you know, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm supposed to be saving money.

2124
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:14,160
You know what? You know, you have the insider info. I was saving money.

2125
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:18,160
I know why. And Rob, what? What am I? But an enabler.

2126
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:22,160
You should do it. You should do it. I'm really fun.

2127
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:27,160
Rob, YOLO, YOLO. And then and then and then and then and then.

2128
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:32,160
No, we could do we could do. Hey, Alan, Alan, YOLO.

2129
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:36,160
I didn't realize that Street Fighter two pinball machine. That's pretty cool.

2130
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:40,160
Yeah, it's not very good. It's a got live one, I think. Do they have that?

2131
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:44,160
OK, so like in when Bobby was talking about Southern Fried Game Rex,

2132
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:48,160
Southern Fried Game Room Expo on a show tonight, he was showing footage from the event.

2133
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:54,160
And they actually had the big boy Mario Brothers pinball table, which you see far less

2134
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:58,160
frequently than the little the more smaller one that was more for kids.

2135
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:03,160
And that is that is what I almost feel like Bobby might want that slightly more than Dr.

2136
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:08,160
No, probably not, because Mrs. Black Wolf is going to want the doctor who table.

2137
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:11,160
So. But yeah, I think that that's up there on the list, too.

2138
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:17,160
And I honestly I love that Mario Brothers table, too, because they have a circus full tear.

2139
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:22,160
I might want to bid on that. Hmm. Hmm. They had a circus full tear.

2140
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:30,160
All right. Well, I need to look and see if I actually I would love to have an Arabian Nights.

2141
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:33,160
Because it's a Papa Duke. Do they have a baby? I haven't. I'm trying to do a show.

2142
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:38,160
I can't look at the catalog. Do they have a baby? It doesn't have like a search thing on here either.

2143
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:44,160
All right. There. Oh, no. Yeah, there's actually if you go in advance search, there's like a keyword search.

2144
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:49,160
They might be able to do that. There's only 742 lot items. It's fine.

2145
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:55,160
They're still adding more, though. Oh, OK. And Bobby Black Wolf says there is not a baby Pac-Man.

2146
02:04:55,160 --> 02:05:04,160
There is? No. Oh, damn. Well, I think there's also two lots, though, because it's two auctions.

2147
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:08,160
I'm sure everybody's doing cartwheels hearing there isn't one after all.

2148
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:13,160
That's all right. Bobby Black will just point out Lot 503 is Circus Voltaire.

2149
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:20,160
So, yeah, it's probably not going to happen. We've got to do adult stuff.

2150
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:29,160
What happened to enabling? Oh, yeah, but you don't have you don't have a Dan.

2151
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:35,160
I can enable you. One ninety nine is a Max 2 machine. Really?

2152
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:40,160
See, I really don't have the space for like an entire DDR machine. You on the other hand, Loki.

2153
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:47,160
I don't think of that much space. We actually don't because of all the pinball and the Mustang in the garage.

2154
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:53,160
And I mean, get this. We've got a Mustang. Come on. Drop.

2155
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:57,160
This is Dan's first car. This is baby.

2156
02:05:57,160 --> 02:06:01,160
I know. I know it's a pain. And you know what? You know what the deal with that is, right?

2157
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:08,160
Is that when Dan dies, I have to stuff his corpse into it, push it off a cliff and explode it midair.

2158
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:13,160
I really don't know how to respond to that.

2159
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:22,160
Little does he know I'm going to do like a paper craft Mustang and use that and then keep the real thing and put air conditioning in that sucker.

2160
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:30,160
See, you need to be more specific. All right, Marcus, thank you for calling into the show and alerting us to the pinball sale,

2161
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:36,160
which led to conversations about Dan's funeral, which are entirely premature.

2162
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:40,160
But hey, that's the way things go here on Orange Launch Radio sometimes.

2163
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:45,160
So, hey, anything else you want to shout out or get on out before we let you go?

2164
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:49,160
No, I just wanted to share that because I figured it'd be of interest.

2165
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:54,160
I still haven't figured out if I'm actually going, but if I am, you know, maybe I'll see if I can do anything to help you guys out.

2166
02:06:54,160 --> 02:07:00,160
Well, Marcus, you figured correctly. Thank you for being in the neighborhood tonight on Orange Launch Radio.

2167
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:05,160
All right. Bye, my friend. Bye.

2168
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:10,160
I hope he didn't mind that I called him by his display name on Discord out of reflex and not PixelPakas.

2169
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:14,160
Oops. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go to our next call.

2170
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:17,160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2171
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:20,160
It's the one and only DJ Ron Maness. How is everybody tonight?

2172
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:23,160
Rama, so good to see you. Literally see you.

2173
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:26,160
Oh, it's you.

2174
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,160
I have to represent the old rules.

2175
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,160
I missed you, Ron Chan.

2176
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:34,160
Wait, there's a pinball machine called Gay Nineties.

2177
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:38,160
Yes, there is a bar called the Gay Nineties in Minneapolis.

2178
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:45,160
So usually when you hear the term gay nineties is referring to the eighteen nineties, which was like, yeah, it's referring to that.

2179
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:51,160
It looks it. Yeah, it just looked weird. Like I was trying to figure out what the theme was supposed to be because they've got like, you know.

2180
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,160
No, it's not. It's not referring to queerest folk on Showtime.

2181
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:59,160
It's not referring to Will and Grace. What else was gay nineties? It's not referring to Frasier.

2182
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:02,160
Let's be real. Everybody on that show is gay. It's not.

2183
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:04,160
And I'm the cheerleader.

2184
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:06,160
And I'm on comedy show. All right.

2185
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:10,160
But you did not call in to talk about the gay nineties, Rama, Loki.

2186
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:13,160
What did you call in to talk about tonight?

2187
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:16,160
But I'm always here to listen to your amazing gay stories, Rob. You know that.

2188
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:20,160
Well, thank you. Thank you. Ah, fair.

2189
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:23,160
OK, a couple of quick stories. I'll be on my merry little way.

2190
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:29,160
All right. So for the last few weeks, I've been playing this game called The Ascent, and it's a great cyberpunk ish game.

2191
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:33,160
And, you know, you know, when you get into a game, you're really into the controller.

2192
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,160
Then you're wondering, why is the controller not working the way it should?

2193
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:40,160
So the trigger button started to stick on my Xbox.

2194
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:46,160
So I get the WD-40 sprayed in there and it should be fine.

2195
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:56,160
A couple of weeks later, start sticking again, and then I spray more WD-40 in the controller at two thirty in the morning when the only light that I have is off the TV.

2196
02:08:56,160 --> 02:09:01,160
Did not realize I shot so much WD-40 into it that the entire controller was just lagging like crazy.

2197
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:04,160
So you made it extra slippery.

2198
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,160
Yup.

2199
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:10,160
So I'm like, I'll just order another Xbox one control off Amazon.

2200
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:14,160
How hard can that be? Famous words.

2201
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:19,160
I didn't expect to find them going as high as 80 to 100 dollars.

2202
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,160
They're not.

2203
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:23,160
Well, I didn't know there was a shortage going on or something.

2204
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:25,160
The one or the Series X?

2205
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:29,160
No, the Xbox one controller.

2206
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:33,160
And I thought, well, Microsoft so long are making them, so they're making the series controller.

2207
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:36,160
And I'm like, I'd rather have an Xbox one controller.

2208
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:41,160
So if I happen to sell my Xbox one, I won't lose any value on it.

2209
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:43,160
So I track one down.

2210
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:47,160
I get I find a remanufactured one for sixty five dollars.

2211
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,160
Perfect. A few days later, the mail shows up.

2212
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:56,160
I grab the package. I open it up.

2213
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:59,160
They send me an Xbox series controller instead.

2214
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:02,160
What?

2215
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:06,160
I'm just sitting here laughing like Kiyo Kusanagi from King of Fighters.

2216
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,160
I'm like, are you serious right now?

2217
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,160
But the series controller is really good.

2218
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:15,160
I would imagine you would have gone full on Orochi if we were going to use that analogy.

2219
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:19,160
I mean, to be perfectly honest, I'm just like, does it work?

2220
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:20,160
Yeah, it works.

2221
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:22,160
It's a controller, Rama.

2222
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,160
Thank you.

2223
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:29,160
I'm like, if I wanted a series controller, I would have just gone to Best Buy when I go out once a week and bought one.

2224
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,160
Yeah.

2225
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:32,160
So can you return it?

2226
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:38,160
Yeah. Amazon is shipping me an official renewed Xbox one controller and it should arrive on Tuesday.

2227
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,160
And it let me keep that one?

2228
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:41,160
No, I've got to send that one back.

2229
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:42,160
Ah, I was going to say.

2230
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:44,160
Well, hey, it was a nice chance to sample it, at least.

2231
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:45,160
Yeah.

2232
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:47,160
I would say it's really nice.

2233
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:50,160
But Jamie, you know, there are ways around certain things.

2234
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:51,160
I'm not going to.

2235
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:54,160
So, you know, there are ways around certain things.

2236
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:58,160
Yes.

2237
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:00,160
And another thing, and I'll be on my merry little way.

2238
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:01,160
No problem.

2239
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:06,160
You know how lately Hallmark has been doing a lot of retro gaming ornaments and stuff like that?

2240
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,160
Oh, yeah.

2241
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:10,160
I got the, uh, the NES, the NES.

2242
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,160
I got a few of them.

2243
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:14,160
This one has been very popular on Amazon.

2244
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:15,160
The Super Nintendo one.

2245
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:17,160
I have it.

2246
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,160
Did you, did you hook it?

2247
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:20,160
Did you put into batteries?

2248
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:21,160
No.

2249
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:22,160
So wait.

2250
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:24,160
Wait, I think I have that one.

2251
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:26,160
I didn't know it took batteries though.

2252
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,160
Yeah.

2253
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,160
This came out this year.

2254
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:29,160
Oh, this year?

2255
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,160
No, then I have, um, the last year, the NES.

2256
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,160
Yeah.

2257
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:35,160
This, this year for 2021, it's the Super NES.

2258
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,160
I need to get it.

2259
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,160
And it goes with three batteries.

2260
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:47,160
And if you put it in, I hit the power button.

2261
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:49,160
We're waiting to hear.

2262
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,160
Does it make you hear it?

2263
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:53,160
No, no sound isn't coming through for us.

2264
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:54,160
Oh, damn.

2265
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,160
You have to tell us what's it doing?

2266
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:59,160
It's playing on the first level theme from Super Mario World.

2267
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:01,160
Oh, that's adorable.

2268
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:04,160
Complete with sound effects.

2269
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:10,160
Or as Bobby Black Wolf in chat currently says, ordering that.

2270
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:11,160
Good luck.

2271
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:15,160
Because our fucking callers tonight are just enabling the shit out of all of us.

2272
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,160
God damn.

2273
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,160
I'm closing these lines back up.

2274
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:19,160
No more phone calls.

2275
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:20,160
No more phone calls.

2276
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:21,160
I'm just kidding.

2277
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:22,160
I heart you guys.

2278
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:24,160
If you want one of these good luck.

2279
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:29,160
Cause I've been following Wario 64 for about a week and a half trying to get one.

2280
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:32,160
And when I got one on Amazon, it says it's secure.

2281
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:33,160
You have it.

2282
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,160
They'll say your order has been canceled.

2283
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:36,160
I get another notification.

2284
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:38,160
I go back and I order it.

2285
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:43,160
I'm told we're going to hold your money until we get one and we'll charge you when it ships

2286
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:45,160
and lo and behold.

2287
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:50,160
Yeah, I am going to have to, I mean, am I just sweet?

2288
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:58,160
I've actually been pretty lucky going to, uh, the, uh, the actual hallmark store near

2289
02:12:58,160 --> 02:12:59,160
my house.

2290
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:02,160
So I might have a hallmark store out in Roseville.

2291
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:04,160
That's not near your house, but I know that one.

2292
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,160
Well, no, there's, there's one out here in EG.

2293
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:09,160
Um, and I have to go to target tomorrow and it's right next door to target.

2294
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:13,160
So good times shopping.

2295
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,160
There is a hallmark store in New York city, right.

2296
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:21,160
And report authority, but I'm like, I'm not going to spend two 75 to go there.

2297
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:25,160
The risk that they don't have and spend another two 75 going home.

2298
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:29,160
But there's, but they do, they've got like arcade machine, um, ornaments and a bunch

2299
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,160
of different Mario and Luigi ones.

2300
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:35,160
I got, uh, I think I got like the eight bit Luigi one before you got it.

2301
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,160
Yeah.

2302
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,160
Yep.

2303
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:40,160
Bobby says, if you go onto hallmark.com, you can do curbside pickup and Bobby says

2304
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:43,160
they have five and he can order one for curbside pickup near him.

2305
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:47,160
So, um, that is another option you could do doing it now.

2306
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,160
Log it in hacking the planet.

2307
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:53,160
Um, before I let you go, I got something for you.

2308
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:57,160
I want to know, um, out here, we were hearing, hearing about hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.

2309
02:13:57,160 --> 02:13:58,160
How you doing?

2310
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:01,160
Is, did that affect you or was that more long Island?

2311
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,160
Give me tropical storm honoree.

2312
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,160
Yeah.

2313
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,160
Oh, that was, that ended up being a big deal.

2314
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,160
Yeah.

2315
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:14,160
Just, just so you know, technically I live in long Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and

2316
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:16,160
Suffolk County is basically long.

2317
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:17,160
Okay.

2318
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,160
Yeah.

2319
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,160
Yeah.

2320
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:20,160
I've, I've, I've been through that.

2321
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,160
Holy crap.

2322
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:22,160
Uh oh.

2323
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:26,160
And there's a battleship one.

2324
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:27,160
She's in the zone.

2325
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:28,160
Here we fucking go.

2326
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:29,160
No, no.

2327
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:33,160
My transformers loving self is like, bitch.

2328
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:37,160
That and even Dan's not going to protest that one to be honest.

2329
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,160
So I have been seeing a lot of transformer stuff, Jamie.

2330
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:43,160
I will start emailing you some of the stuff that I see.

2331
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:44,160
Okay.

2332
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,160
Well, you know, I'm not on Facebook anymore.

2333
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:48,160
So that's why I said email.

2334
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,160
Yeah.

2335
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:50,160
Thank you.

2336
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,160
You're welcome.

2337
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:52,160
You're welcome.

2338
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:55,160
I'm glad to see your internet's up and you're not under water.

2339
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:58,160
Cause the news out here was making it sound pretty terrible.

2340
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:03,160
That's because I'm in zone B, basically three zones.

2341
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:09,160
You put in your address, A, B, or C if it's zone, a pack your shit and go zone B. You

2342
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:12,160
might not have to pack, but just be careful.

2343
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:14,160
Zone C you're good.

2344
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:19,160
So was fire Island and zone a, cause I bet they were probably.

2345
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:23,160
Remember you need a special bus to get over to fire.

2346
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,160
Yeah.

2347
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,160
They have one.

2348
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:28,160
Do you want me to get one too?

2349
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:29,160
Uh, yeah, sure.

2350
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:30,160
For you.

2351
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,160
Sure.

2352
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,160
Actually they're only letting me get one.

2353
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:33,160
Sorry.

2354
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,160
That's all right.

2355
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:35,160
I'll log in and look and see if the Roseville store has them.

2356
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,160
All right.

2357
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,160
Y'all happy?

2358
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:38,160
Y'all happy?

2359
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:39,160
You made a sale.

2360
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,160
Y'all happy?

2361
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:41,160
You made a sale.

2362
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:42,160
Congrats.

2363
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:45,160
That's all right.

2364
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:46,160
All right.

2365
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:51,160
Wrap it up before you, before you sell us some something else, anything else on your

2366
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:52,160
mind tonight?

2367
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,160
No, that's it.

2368
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,160
I just didn't think this was going to turn into everybody buying stuff.

2369
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,160
Yeah.

2370
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:58,160
Yeah.

2371
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:59,160
Yeah.

2372
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:00,160
Happy holidays.

2373
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,160
They're not letting me do the pickup.

2374
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,160
All right.

2375
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,160
Take care Rama.

2376
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:04,160
All right.

2377
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:05,160
Take care.

2378
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:06,160
All right.

2379
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:09,160
Listen to anime jam session Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.

2380
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:10,160
All right.

2381
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:14,160
Uh, I think that was all the, uh, the calls that we had there waiting to go.

2382
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:15,160
Um, let's see.

2383
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:19,160
Uh, Oh, as 200 Matt says, yeah, fire Island was evacuated.

2384
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:21,160
I actually, I went there once.

2385
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:24,160
Uh, I think it was like 2006.

2386
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:26,160
Uh, don't get it twisted.

2387
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:31,160
It wasn't anything scandalous that you said, like me and my lesbian friend took the ferry

2388
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,160
out there.

2389
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,160
He just to see what it was all about.

2390
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:39,160
Cause we always hear about fire out, fire out and like nothing was that we saw a house

2391
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:43,160
party going on and we walked to the beach and we were like, all right, it's cold.

2392
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:44,160
Let's go back.

2393
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,160
So that was my trip.

2394
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:49,160
That was my exciting trip to fire Island way back in the day.

2395
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
But I hope everybody's okay.

2396
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,160
All right.

2397
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,160
Um, I guess that's it.

2398
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,160
We didn't get any, uh, emails tonight.

2399
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:58,160
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2400
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:01,160
The listeners have had enough say tonight on our wallets.

2401
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:04,160
So that's where every gamer has a voice.

2402
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:05,160
Nope.

2403
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:06,160
We're done.

2404
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:07,160
We're done.

2405
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,160
No.

2406
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:12,160
Uh, Rama says you have to go to fire Island during June for obvious reasons.

2407
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,160
Someday, one of these days, uh, I'll get back out there.

2408
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,160
All right.

2409
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,160
Oh, I didn't even check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories, but I

2410
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:20,160
guess I should do that.

2411
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,160
Loki.

2412
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,160
Do you have any last minute stories?

2413
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,160
Uh, no, but I was gonna mention a lot.

2414
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:25,160
57 57 is a pair of hair paradise.

2415
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:26,160
Second mix.

2416
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:31,160
And of course lot Thursday, three 17.

2417
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:35,160
It's ready for shipping to 50 inch monitors included Derby owners club.

2418
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,160
Get out.

2419
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:40,160
I don't have room for a doc at my house.

2420
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,160
A Derby owner's club.

2421
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,160
We need to just put in and have like the big warehouse.

2422
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:48,160
That's nothing but like our own combined personal arcade.

2423
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,160
That would be very cool.

2424
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,160
Yeah.

2425
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,160
Yeah.

2426
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:52,160
Oh my gosh.

2427
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,160
All right.

2428
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:56,160
Uh, well that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

2429
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:59,160
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight.

2430
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:02,160
Hey, if you like what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two, help us spread

2431
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:06,160

2432
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,160
are here to put out on air.

2433
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:13,160
So, um, spread the word, um, uh, neatly leave us a nice five star review on a site like

02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:16,160
iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this podcast.

2435
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:22,160

2436
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,160

2437
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:27,160
So, um, thank you so much, uh, for everybody that does that.

2438
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,160
I really appreciate you.

2439

2441
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,160

Uh, you can check that out.

2443
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:41,160
Um, and maybe even more to come soon in the future.

2444
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,160
So, um, that is about it.

2445
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:45,160
Now we're going to get final thoughts.

2446
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,160
Um, dark soccer, are you streaming tonight?

2447
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,160
I am streaming tonight.

2448
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,160
So we'll start with you.

2449
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,160
All right.

2450
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:56,160
Um, uh, pig is the best killer in dead by daylight.

2451
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,160
And if you argue with me, you're wrong.

2452
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:59,160
All right.

2453
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,160
Uh, have a good one.

2454
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:01,160
Enjoy.

2455
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:02,160
Have a good stream.

2456
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,160
I'm popping out now.

2457
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:04,160
Yep.

2458
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,160
Sounds good.

2459
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:06,160
And, uh, let's see your final thought.

2460
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:07,160
Loki.

2461
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:13,160
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to try to work in some more games through out my week.

2462
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:15,160
So I'm not just playing Minecraft all the time.

2463
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:16,160
Good idea.

2464
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:18,160
Although Minecraft is cool too as well.

2465
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:19,160
Don't get me wrong.

2466
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:20,160
Yeah.

2467
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:21,160
I'm still playing that.

2468
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:22,160
Yeah.

2469
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:25,160
And, uh, my final thought is I I'm going to keep, keep sampling some games on that cloud

2470
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:27,160
gaming Xbox stuff.

2471
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:28,160
Cause it's pretty fun.

2472
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,160
So, uh, and I need to play more 12 minutes.

2473
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,160
I didn't even talk about that.

2474
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,160
I started 12 minutes and I didn't get very far.

2475
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:35,160
I got distracted and that was that.

2476
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,160
So maybe next week we'll talk a little bit about that.

2477
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,160
Lots of games to talk about.

2478
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:45,160
Uh, we will be back next week and that will be our last show for a couple of weeks because,

2479
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:47,160
uh, there is no show labor day weekend.

2480
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:50,160
Uh, as, as has been the case for like seven years, ever since I started going to dragon

2481
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:53,160
con, uh, there hasn't been a show labor day weekend.

2482
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:54,160
So just keep that in mind.

2483
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:57,160
We'll be back next week, but we'll, we'll not be here in two weeks.

2484
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,160
So we hope to see you next week for an all new OLR.

2485
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:03,160
And my apologies, I should have put this at the beginning of the show, but my apologies

2486
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:04,160
to the podcast listeners.

2487
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:08,160
Um, because the cast took forever to get up on the feed this last week.

2488
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:13,160
Um, because the show had a major tech kick up and when that stuff happens, it just takes

2489
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:15,160
me a lot longer to put together.

2490
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,160
And I got really lazy.

2491
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:17,160
Sorry guys.

2492
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:18,160
But there's also a lot going on.

2493
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,160
And then I had internet issues here.

2494
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:23,160
I'm actually glad the internet held out tonight cause we were having internet issues and I

2495
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:25,160
was a little worried we weren't even going to get to have a show tonight.

2496
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:28,160
So thank you internet gods for holding out tonight.

2497
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:29,160
I appreciate that.

2498
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:30,160
All right, let's wrap it up.

2499
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:33,160
We'll see you in seven days for an all new OLR.

2500
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:34,160
Have a great week.

2501
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:35,160
Happy gaming.

2502
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:36,160
