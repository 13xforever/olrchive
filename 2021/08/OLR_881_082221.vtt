00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
25 years ago, years truly was downloading games via Zmodem, AOL channels, playing on

00:14.240 --> 00:16.080
the Imagination Network somewhere around then too.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.240
I played Doom, I played Duke Nukem 3D, but then the brown medieval trappings of Quake

00:20.240 --> 00:21.300
called my name.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.000
And now, 25 years later, I'm doing it all over again.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
And you know what?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.380
I am just fine with that.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.380
Or at least I will do it this week.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.960
It's been a busy weekend, okay?

00:28.960 --> 00:30.360
This is the end of the game on my two playlists.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.480
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:33.480 --> 00:36.300
this anniversary and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

00:36.300 --> 00:37.300
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.300
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:38.300 --> 00:46.320
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.320 --> 00:53.640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 881

00:53.640 --> 00:57.380
of our show for this August the 22nd of 2021.

00:57.380 --> 01:01.280
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm happy to be with you week after week here on Sunday

01:01.280 --> 01:05.340
nights where we do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

01:05.340 --> 01:10.380
Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:10.380 --> 01:15.420
And joining me as they do every week, except last week, but say hello to DarkSakra or Jamie

01:15.420 --> 01:16.420
Summers.

01:16.420 --> 01:17.420
Hi.

01:17.420 --> 01:18.420
Hi.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.460
I understand you haven't been feeling well, but I'm glad you're back.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.460
Yeah.

01:22.460 --> 01:27.660
I had an upper respiratory infection and now it's a sinus infection.

01:27.660 --> 01:36.260
So I'm on some good antibiotics and hopefully I'll be back to normal in no time.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.140
I feel a lot better than I did last week.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.740
Well, two things with that.

01:39.740 --> 01:44.520
Number one, at least it wasn't the big C and number two, your wig looks marvelous.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.020
So it's a wig.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.580
I bleached all this shit.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.580
Sorry.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.580
Kidding.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.580
It's a wig.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.700
I don't wear wigs.

01:52.700 --> 01:53.700
Yes.

01:53.700 --> 01:54.700
I understand.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.700
All right.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.700
Oh.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700
Oh, go ahead.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.700
Nothing.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.700
I'll bring it up during my game.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.700
All right.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.420
Uh, say hello to somebody else who only wears their natural hair on this program.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.480
Say hello to type master Loki.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
As little bit as I can.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.480
I got a haircut.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.240
That's the reason I understand what I have to tell me it's too long.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.240
What little bit is left?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
You have to work with.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.980
I understand that struggle very well.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.840
Well, no, no, it's not going away.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.340
I'm making it go away.

02:21.100 --> 02:25.100
I always buzz it so that I don't have to comb it.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.100
Must be nice.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.100
Can't relate.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.100
Good thing.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.100
I like hats.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.060
I just, I'm just giving you crap.

02:32.060 --> 02:35.040
What's what's the game playing behind you tonight, Loki, for those that are watching

02:35.040 --> 02:36.040
live on Twitch?

02:36.040 --> 02:42.140
Uh, one of the last greatest saints row games that there was saints row two, actually saints

02:42.140 --> 02:43.140
row three.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.140
Wasn't bad.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.140
We don't talk about saints row four though.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.140
Yeah.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.140
Saints row three was a lot of fun.

02:47.140 --> 02:48.260
Like I, again, I've said this before on the show.

02:48.260 --> 02:52.520
I don't think I've ever laughed harder playing a video game than I did those opening moments

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
of saints row three.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.780
Like, it's just so fucking funny.

02:55.780 --> 03:00.460
Saints row three felt like the saints row that the writer's strike hit that like it

03:00.460 --> 03:06.300
was pretty good, but then they made some really stupid decisions like story wise.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.620
It's like, Hey, you know, that character that you're really liking is one of the best characters

03:10.620 --> 03:11.620
in the game.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.620
Yeah.

03:12.620 --> 03:13.620
We're going to kill them off in the beginning of the game.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.620
Isn't that fun?

03:14.620 --> 03:15.620
Isn't that fun?

03:15.620 --> 03:17.620
Don't you guys enjoy that?

03:17.980 --> 03:19.540
Surprise.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.500
So it's like the matrix online.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.500
Everything is led up to this.

03:22.500 --> 03:28.440
Then they retcon that bullshit into a new game and then like they try to retcon it again.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.980
Now they're retconning the whole thing, which is I'm totally cool with.

03:31.980 --> 03:32.980
All right.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.860
But we'll get to that later in the show.

03:34.860 --> 03:39.660
First off, we're going to start off with tonight's kickoff topic, which is actually a little

03:39.660 --> 03:42.820
bit more of a serious topic because it's a serious problem that's happening all over

03:42.820 --> 03:47.180
Twitch and we need to talk about these hate raids that are occurring on Twitch.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.900
It is a show about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.540
And this is certainly, unfortunately, a part of what gaming cultures become because Twitch

03:56.540 --> 03:58.580
is so prevalent in our culture.

03:58.580 --> 04:00.780
And unfortunately, it's affecting people's lifestyles.

04:00.780 --> 04:04.620
So this qualifies for discussion on tonight's show.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.460
And let's just be real, these hate raids suck.

04:07.460 --> 04:14.660
They've been occurring 99.99% on a marginalized communities channel.

04:14.660 --> 04:21.620
Unfortunately, some of the fear about all of these new tags may be used to harass certain

04:21.620 --> 04:27.220
individuals certainly seems to be the case as we see several black streamers are getting

04:27.220 --> 04:28.500
targeted with this.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.700
Several trans streamers are getting targeted with this.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.700
Lots of folks across.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.700
Friends of mine.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.700
Yeah.

04:34.700 --> 04:35.700
Oh yeah.

04:35.700 --> 04:43.420
I was watching LC one night when this happened to him and he shut off the alerts as you usually

04:43.420 --> 04:47.420
do and you know, all that stuff and you know, just try to play it off and acting normal,

04:47.420 --> 04:49.620
but it's irritating, right?

04:49.620 --> 04:53.900
Especially when, you know, sure, it's really easy to hit the button and stop this stuff

04:53.900 --> 04:54.900
from happening.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.980
I mean, heaven forbid it ever happened here at VoG network, but our policy, you know,

04:57.980 --> 05:00.940
we have a plan if it were to happen here.

05:00.940 --> 05:05.260
Number one is don't acknowledge it because that's what the folks want.

05:05.260 --> 05:08.800
It is very easy for me to suddenly turn off the little bar at the bottom that shows everybody

05:08.800 --> 05:09.900
who's following.

05:09.900 --> 05:13.580
I think this is a good thing that ours is a little more subtle because we're recording

05:13.580 --> 05:14.820
a podcast.

05:14.820 --> 05:15.900
Most streamers don't do that.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.360
They have little with a little name that comes up really big because they want to read it.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.620
You know, thank you so and so for the follow, but the hate Raiders obviously exploit that

05:23.620 --> 05:28.740
to try to get streamers to stay, say memes and you know, stupid jokes and things like

05:28.740 --> 05:31.300
that, but we can turn that off relatively quickly.

05:31.300 --> 05:36.180
And thankfully 90% of the time Bobby's here and he'll have this thing in sub mode in two

05:36.180 --> 05:41.120
seconds and I'll have ads running in three seconds.

05:41.120 --> 05:46.640
So you know, unfortunately for those that don't subscribe to VoG network here on Twitch,

05:46.640 --> 05:51.020
you will be inconvenienced a little bit and I apologize for that, but you can, I'm sure

05:51.020 --> 05:55.020
you all understand if we have to hit the panic button because something like that's happening,

05:55.020 --> 05:57.980
we're going to hit the panic button and it may be a little inconvenient.

05:57.980 --> 06:02.140
It's inconvenient for us too, but we're, our, our top priority is, you know, making this

06:02.140 --> 06:05.280
show that we're doing here.

06:05.280 --> 06:11.180
But isn't it weird that I'm having to discuss, here's our plan, here's our thing that we're

06:11.180 --> 06:15.880
going to do when it's Twitch at their level.

06:15.880 --> 06:21.720
They've sent some tweets that are like, we're listening, we know it's a problem, it's unacceptable,

06:21.720 --> 06:26.200
but I mean, it's still happening and what is Twitch is like, well, we can't tell you

06:26.200 --> 06:31.120
what we're doing because then the Raiders, you know, are constantly working to circumvent

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
that.

06:32.120 --> 06:37.520
Let that to an extent, but it really looks like you aren't doing anything Twitch.

06:37.520 --> 06:46.180
I mean, when people are continuing to get these raids, perhaps explain something that

06:46.180 --> 06:51.240
you implemented that already got circumvented since it was already circumvented anyway.

06:51.240 --> 06:55.840
You know, let people peek behind the curtain a little more because what I find fascinating

06:55.840 --> 06:59.960
is that there's, you know, individual modders and people out there that are trying to help

06:59.960 --> 07:01.640
the situation.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.400
Somebody put together a script that would ban like all these usernames super fast and

07:05.400 --> 07:09.060
things like that, which is, it helps.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.160
But it's weird that Twitch isn't doing that.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.800
Do you want to say something, Jamie?

07:12.800 --> 07:18.280
Oh, I was going to say, Burban was talking about using that earlier today.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.160
I was trying to get the link, but I had to hop out of his stream to come here.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.160
Yeah, no, I understand.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.160
Loki, what were you going to say?

07:25.160 --> 07:29.000
I was going to say, I don't understand what it is that they're doing that they feel that

07:29.000 --> 07:30.840
they can't discuss it.

07:30.840 --> 07:37.520
If it's going to be that easily circumvented, if they mention it like, then that's obviously

07:37.520 --> 07:38.760
not the approach to take.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.520
If it's going to be that easily circumvented, I mean, I don't understand what the problem

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
is.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.320
Well, and honestly, and I put this in a tweet and this is my honest to God feedback on this

07:47.320 --> 07:51.520
whole thing is that Twitch, if you're serious about this, the easiest way you could counter

07:51.520 --> 07:56.600
this today is disabled the ability to create a new account done.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.960
And I know people are saying they're going, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of Twitch

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
money?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.160
Yeah, they want money.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
They want this growth.

08:03.160 --> 08:10.120
Well, Twitch, clearly you can't handle the growth, Twitch, if you aren't able to deal

08:10.120 --> 08:11.120
with this issue.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.320
And I think an action like that, as drastic as it may seem, well, guess what?

08:16.320 --> 08:20.240
Twitch needs to show they're doing something drastic about the issues.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.680
Drastic times call for drastic measures, and I think they should disable the creation of

08:24.680 --> 08:26.760
new accounts until they fix this.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.640
All of you watching right now have an account.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.740
And I would bet even the people listening on the podcast feed probably already have

08:32.740 --> 08:34.000
an account.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.320
Most people that are going to participate in Twitch already have an account.

08:37.320 --> 08:43.040
Now sure, there are people that aged 18 every day and maybe want to get on Twitch for the

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
first time.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.720
I understand a couple weeks of inconvenience is going to be worth it in the long run.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.480
And it'll, it would, it would be Twitch showing they're serious about this and they're trying

08:52.480 --> 08:54.240
to do something about this.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.780
And that's, that's the hill.

08:55.780 --> 08:56.960
Is this the hill over here?

08:56.960 --> 08:58.200
Because I'll go die on it.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.440
This is what Twitch should do right now.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.000
Disable the ability to create a new account.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.520
Or if you want to toss me the bare fucking minimum, you want to give me a little grass

09:08.520 --> 09:12.280
on that hill, at least make it harder to make an account.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.480
Because right now it's not hard to make an account on Twitch.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.420
And that's what the bots are exploiting.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.940
You know, or look at the accounts that are being made.

09:21.940 --> 09:27.620
If they're making like, you know, John Doe, one, two, three, John Doe, one, two, four,

09:27.620 --> 09:29.680
John Doe, one, two, five.

09:29.680 --> 09:34.500
If those three accounts are made in like a five minute span, the system should be able

09:34.500 --> 09:38.380
to detect that something's afoot and like stop that immediately.

09:38.380 --> 09:46.300
So I'll tell you something that happened with my stream at midnight that I had.

09:46.300 --> 09:51.700
Is I kept seeing this thing like lunar underscore this, lunar underscore that, lunar underscore

09:51.700 --> 09:52.700
this.

09:52.700 --> 09:58.460
And it would happen like maybe every 20 minutes or so.

09:58.460 --> 10:04.940
And thankfully, Finara was in there last night to help me with the ban hammer, but I was,

10:04.940 --> 10:12.080
I had to ban them like the moment that they would come in and my, my, my channel is follower

10:12.080 --> 10:17.200
only right now for, for chat.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.760
And that's, and that's the bummer.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.840
That's what most people are having to do, which sucks.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.320
And you know, I'm sitting here talking about, well, our plan is I'm going to hit this button

10:24.320 --> 10:27.120
that's going to fuck over anyone who doesn't pay us money.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
And I hate that.

10:28.120 --> 10:33.860
I hate that situation that we're in, but I'm going to do it to silence the hate if I have

10:33.860 --> 10:35.800
to.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.560
And I imagine there's a lot of people out there for their communities.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.560
They don't want to do this.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.800
They don't want to lessen the amount of people, legitimate people that can participate with

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
their community.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.840
But Twitch is putting us in this position and what's pissing a lot of people off about

10:48.840 --> 10:51.880
it is that Twitch takes half our income.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
Everybody knows that, right?

10:52.880 --> 10:55.640
I say our income, like we're making a ton of money here at VoG network.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
We're not.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.640
We're pretty transparent.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.640
We're tier one subs.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.640
Yeah.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.640
Yeah.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.160
So tier one subs cost $5, right?

11:04.160 --> 11:09.220
And the, the broadcaster gets $2 and 50 cents of that, that currency obviously varies from

11:09.220 --> 11:13.700
country to country, but it's basically $5 or the equivalent and the broadcaster gets

11:13.700 --> 11:14.700
half of it, two fifties.

11:14.700 --> 11:19.620
That means Twitch is pocketing the other $2 and 50 cents for what?

11:19.620 --> 11:20.620
The bandwidth.

11:20.620 --> 11:21.620
Okay.

11:21.620 --> 11:25.740
The, um, the brokerage of selling the ads, which, you know, we're going to come back

11:25.740 --> 11:27.780
to that point in a minute and all this other stuff.

11:27.780 --> 11:28.780
Okay.

11:28.780 --> 11:29.780
I get that.

11:29.780 --> 11:35.020
But part of that is also creating a safe and secure place because we're bringing our communities

11:35.020 --> 11:36.020
here.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.020
Y'all want us to bleed purple, right?

11:39.020 --> 11:44.380
Well, it's also going a little bit beyond that too, because, um, people have had to

11:44.380 --> 11:52.780
shut off, uh, uh, permanent discord invite links, um, which, um, I haven't, I had the

11:52.780 --> 11:58.460
problem once and thankfully other people caught it and it was taken care of before I had to,

11:58.460 --> 12:00.060
to deal with it too much.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.060
And thank you everybody.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.060
Thank you.

12:02.060 --> 12:05.660
Actually, Mike Deft in chat who, who really was phenomenal and helping me, helping me

12:05.660 --> 12:06.660
with that.

12:06.660 --> 12:11.700
But they're going in and also finding those discord links and rating discord channels

12:11.700 --> 12:13.700
as well.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.980
Yup.

12:15.980 --> 12:19.780
And uh, I'm not going to tell you specifically how the contingency plan works at VOG, but

12:19.780 --> 12:26.060
we, we, we have a way to, uh, mix that up if we need to, you know, and, um, but it's

12:26.060 --> 12:27.060
stupid.

12:27.060 --> 12:29.860
Like we should, we shouldn't have to take these precautions in the first place.

12:29.860 --> 12:35.820
Um, yeah, anyway, um, so what's being done about it, uh, from the user perspective?

12:35.820 --> 12:40.700
Well, there's been calls for a day off Twitch basically, uh, and that's what it is.

12:40.700 --> 12:45.940
Hashtag a day off Twitch, several streamers got together to say that they are going to

12:45.940 --> 12:50.140
boycott Twitch on September 1st is the day of the big boycott.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.580
Um, and, uh, that means don't watch it.

12:52.580 --> 12:53.700
That means don't stream on it.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.180
And I'll tell you, there's a lot extra convenient for me cause it's my anniversary.

12:57.180 --> 13:01.380
Well, and you know, yeah, and for me, I'm going to be in the air on my way to dragon

13:01.380 --> 13:05.580
con, so I wouldn't have really been able to participate anyway, but I'm still there in

13:05.580 --> 13:08.780
spirit and actually go ahead.

13:08.780 --> 13:12.740
I was going to say, I've, I've posted to take it a step further and turn off all of your

13:12.740 --> 13:17.540
hosting, make your channel dead for the day.

13:17.540 --> 13:23.220
I think that's a great idea, especially if you are hosting somebody and they are alive

13:23.220 --> 13:29.600
on that day and should know better, you shouldn't be giving them the attention to for breaking

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
the boycott.

13:30.600 --> 13:37.440
If a marginalized person who relies on Twitch for income wants to go live on September 1st

13:37.440 --> 13:42.720
because they can't get by without it, I'm not going to judge that, but I'm not going

13:42.720 --> 13:43.720
to judge that.

13:43.720 --> 13:50.240
But I mean, most of the people that I have on my auto host, yeah, yeah, exactly.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.080
Most people don't fall in that category.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
Yeah.

13:53.080 --> 13:58.240
Um, but I just, I kind of want to put the little parentheses like I, I fully support

13:58.240 --> 14:01.680
the boycott parentheses, but I understand there are those who can't do it.

14:01.680 --> 14:08.880
So, you know, and that whole thing, um, but, um, yeah, and, and actually something I suggested

14:08.880 --> 14:12.120
on Twitter that, um, you know, I'm probably not the only person to think of this, but

14:12.120 --> 14:14.720
I swear I thought of it all by myself and I'm going to pat myself on the back.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.200
I think this is a great idea.

14:16.200 --> 14:21.120
I think September 1st is a day you celebrate your community somewhere else, meaning don't

14:21.120 --> 14:22.120
do Twitch.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
Why not?

14:23.120 --> 14:27.300
This is the day that you create a YouTube or this is the day that you make a podcast.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.880
This is the day that you get on your discord in a private channel because discord lets

14:30.880 --> 14:32.380
you stream in there too.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.380
And you stream to your community.

14:33.380 --> 14:34.380
Lots of us have TikToks.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.380
What's that?

14:35.380 --> 14:36.380
Lots of us have TikToks.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.380
Yeah.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.380
TikToks.

14:38.380 --> 14:41.460
So we'll put like highlight reels and stuff up.

14:41.460 --> 14:48.620
In my opinion, it's more powerful to show ways that you can support your community without

14:48.620 --> 14:52.360
Twitch, I think sends a bigger message in my opinion.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.540
But that of course leads to this other discussion where a lot of people are like, well, I'm

14:55.540 --> 14:59.940
just going to leave Twitch and go somewhere else to which I'm going to say, where, where

14:59.940 --> 15:05.460
like there are, and I'm sorry, there's no big competitor to Twitch right now.

15:05.460 --> 15:11.160
YouTube I guess, but you know, and there's all these other up and coming companies I've

15:11.160 --> 15:13.960
heard of things like what is that Altair, Altair?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.460
I've heard of other places and don't get me wrong.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.400
I'm rooting for these underdogs.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.220
I'm rooting for them.

15:20.220 --> 15:25.420
But here's the thing, Twitch makes it very easy to start making money.

15:25.420 --> 15:29.020
So you know how I said earlier, half that money goes to them brokering ads and all that

15:29.020 --> 15:30.020
stuff.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.020
Yeah.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.860
Twitch makes it very easy to start making money on Twitch and the fact that they're

15:33.860 --> 15:38.140
owned by Amazon kind of helps because if nothing else, Amazon's always going to step in there

15:38.140 --> 15:41.760
to show, you know, Billie Eilish or whatever the hell's going on on Amazon prime right

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
now.

15:42.760 --> 15:48.800
So the reality is, and again, many people are relying on Twitch for either supplemental

15:48.800 --> 15:53.640
income or income, or even just the folks that are like, it's kind of fun to get a check

15:53.640 --> 16:00.080
for $100 even if it's twice a year, if that, you know, it's kind of fun to see that happen.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.360
And so it makes people a little bit hesitant to just jump off and go somewhere else.

16:04.360 --> 16:11.080
So like we have to really like before we just say we're going to go somewhere else where

16:11.080 --> 16:12.960
like who's built up to that level yet?

16:12.960 --> 16:17.760
I mean, maybe YouTube, but even YouTube, I think it's a lot harder to make money on YouTube,

16:17.760 --> 16:21.240
but once you kind of get in there, you can probably make a lot more to be honest.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.520
Just depending on what level creator you are, just once you get in there, you know, yeah,

16:26.520 --> 16:28.120
however many years that'll take.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.120
Right.

16:29.120 --> 16:35.480
And so, you know, getting 50 followers and three viewers at a time, that isn't insurmountable.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.600
That's very achievable for many people.

16:39.600 --> 16:44.140
YouTube wants what, is it 10,000 followers on your channel now?

16:44.140 --> 16:45.140
It's a lot.

16:45.140 --> 16:52.980
It's 1000 subscribers and I can't remember the watch hours is, but it's like, you know,

16:52.980 --> 16:58.700
a large amount of watch hours, 50 followers, 1000 followers.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.620
Who's got the easier bar to get in there and make money?

17:01.620 --> 17:03.660
We don't even have 1000 followers here on volume.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.460
I certainly don't have that on my personal channel.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.820
And that's also assuming that everything goes fine with YouTube.

17:08.820 --> 17:15.840
It's just like randomly, hey, today we deleted your channel, you know, for a reason.

17:15.840 --> 17:20.880
Hey, today we disabled monetization from your channel because you're putting out too much

17:20.880 --> 17:26.880
content that is, your content is not engaging enough or something like that.

17:26.880 --> 17:32.440
Or you're recycling content, even though you're not, you know, it's just plagued with bots,

17:32.440 --> 17:34.480
different types of bots.

17:34.480 --> 17:41.720
But also, you know, you have the problems with these large platforms that they are to

17:41.720 --> 17:48.200
the size now where they can't automate, they basically can't regulate themselves using

17:48.200 --> 17:49.200
people.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.920
They have to rely on bots to do everything and the bots are stupid.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.920
I agree.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.660
And that's part of my issue with YouTube is that, and I've said this before, YouTube is

17:57.660 --> 17:59.580
not very creator friendly.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.500
They always side with bots.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.140
And I don't know how I feel about that.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.140
I don't, I don't love that.

18:04.140 --> 18:09.380
And also like, yeah, the DMCA process too and copyright claims is just absolutely stupid.

18:09.380 --> 18:14.740
It's like you get claimed by somebody, you dispute the claim and instead of a third party

18:14.740 --> 18:20.640
looking at it, it's, it's up to the person that filed the claim to decide, Hey, you know,

18:20.640 --> 18:22.340
do I still think that the claim is fair?

18:22.340 --> 18:27.900
And I mean, if it's done in bad faith, I mean, you're really the only way you could possibly,

18:27.900 --> 18:34.900
you know, do anything about it is to, you know, file another claim or like a final counterclaim

18:34.900 --> 18:36.400
or something like that and take them to court.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.980
I don't know.

18:37.980 --> 18:39.380
It's very risky.

18:39.380 --> 18:45.820
And a lot of these companies will throw around their, their weight as a big company, Activision,

18:45.820 --> 18:51.860
for example, where they will, you know, copyright claim videos talking about, you know, the

18:51.860 --> 18:56.820
new call of duty and leaking information about it.

18:56.820 --> 18:59.860
Sorry that you don't like the information being leaked about your game, but it's not

18:59.860 --> 19:00.860
game footage.

19:00.860 --> 19:04.420
So you can, you know, what can you do?

19:04.420 --> 19:08.900
You can go fix your own problems within your company and stop taking up your lead.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.540
It's like, what are they going to do?

19:10.540 --> 19:13.860
I mean, you could fight them in court, but it's like their Activision with billions of

19:13.860 --> 19:17.300
dollars and legal teams and you're Joe, nobody.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.940
So what are you gonna do?

19:18.940 --> 19:22.180
All right, let's go to our chat room because of course I do want to get you guys and your

19:22.180 --> 19:23.520
thoughts here on the show as well.

19:23.520 --> 19:29.120
So over twitch.tv slash vog network, Bobby Blackwell says, let's all go to mixer.

19:29.120 --> 19:33.920
You know, I think that I get that that comment has said tongue firmly planted in cheek, but

19:33.920 --> 19:38.960
it also goes to show that any of these platforms where anybody is making a significant amount

19:38.960 --> 19:42.000
of monetization could go away at any time.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.960
And I think of our friends over at black compat who used to have a show at vog network years

19:46.960 --> 19:48.680
ago called the electric sisterhood.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.960
If you're not following their, their new rebrand here on twitch black compat, I urge you to

19:53.880 --> 19:55.000
because they're fabulous.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.400
But my point is they were on mixer and they built up on mixer.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.920
And I think Bobby, correct me if I'm wrong, I think they were mixer partner or whatever the

20:02.920 --> 20:08.360
equivalent is over there, because I know like they are very in like with Microsoft and

20:08.360 --> 20:13.240
Xbox. And I think at least one of them is an Xbox, Xbox VIP, if not both.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.200
So, you know, I know there's a lot of love there.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.560
So them being a mixer made a lot of sense.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.720
And then one day mixer shut down.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.920
And so they've had to rebuild over here on Twitch, which, you know, they've done a great

20:26.920 --> 20:30.480
job, but it still sucks to have to build that up.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.800
Thank you. Bobby says they were and only one is an MVP.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.840
So sorry, I just I couldn't remember the terms and all that stuff.

20:36.840 --> 20:41.760
But yes, I knew they were very engaged with the Xbox ecosystem.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.480
So but yeah, I mean, you can all go away one day.

20:46.360 --> 20:52.920
There's also just in Twitch in particular, this happened to one of my newer friends,

20:54.320 --> 20:57.840
Fitness to Cosplay, I don't know if you've ever caught their channel.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.280
That's a Twitter account that follows me.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.080
I feel like I've seen that name before.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.720
Yeah, really, really, really sweet person.

21:06.120 --> 21:16.360
But at any rate, in trying to remove the the bots and all of the the, you know, various

21:17.400 --> 21:21.280
raiders and things, they lost all of their followers.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.720
They accidentally banned everybody.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.600
Yeah, I've I've heard of this elsewhere, too.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.920
Yeah. Yeah.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.960
So but it's they're not the only one that this has happened to either.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.560
I'm just going to throw that out there, too.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.680
So this goes.

21:35.120 --> 21:42.240
Broader than the consequence, I'd say the aftermath of it has been deeper.

21:43.800 --> 21:50.640
So anyway, you know, I I'm participating, but I also am not actively participating on

21:50.640 --> 21:55.080
September 1st, I'd love to create content on that day elsewhere, do like a stream in a

21:55.080 --> 21:59.440
private discord or something, but unfortunately, I had already made plans for that day

21:59.440 --> 22:00.840
and that's the day everybody decided.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.560
So but I'm actively participating in spirit and I look forward to Twitch giving some more

22:07.560 --> 22:14.040
details, maybe on that day as to what they're going to do about this and be, you know, a

22:14.040 --> 22:19.480
little more than just we're listening, we're doing and just vague trees of some more

22:19.480 --> 22:22.720
specifics. Honestly, I'm looking forward to that.

22:22.720 --> 22:27.480
And my thoughts are with those folks that keep getting attacked with this bullshit.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.760
Like it's just it's it's so stupid.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.240
Like I just what is the point?

22:32.760 --> 22:37.800
I don't even know what the I get, but I guess it's for the lols, as they say in some of the

22:37.800 --> 22:38.920
darker parts of the Internet.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.600
It's just silly. Nobody's laughing.

22:43.680 --> 22:48.480
All right. Anyhow, let's let's go back to a little bit more pleasant of a topic and talk

22:48.480 --> 22:51.560
about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.200
And how is your gaming week?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.160
So Darsakura, we'll go to you.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.000
How is your gaming week?

22:56.680 --> 23:04.240
Um, I, I played Dead by Daylight, Fantasian Part Two came out, so I played that on

23:04.240 --> 23:07.680
Tuesday, but my game froze.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.720
So I guess maybe there's some bugs to work out.

23:10.960 --> 23:15.600
But I lost my entire first battle, which was a long and fucking annoying battle.

23:15.920 --> 23:22.040
So I will be, I guess, starting it over again on this upcoming Tuesday.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.200
We are starting over.

23:25.040 --> 23:32.120
Uh, I have made a new character on Final Fantasy 14 on Midgar Samara, so still on

23:32.120 --> 23:32.560
Aether.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.600
I wanted to go on Gilgamesh, but there's no room.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.080
So now I have three characters on the same server.

23:40.200 --> 23:40.760
Go fig.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.480
Um, I'm going to start off with a Thaumaturge this time.

23:46.040 --> 23:46.840
A Dertmaturge?

23:47.800 --> 23:48.520
A Dertmaturge.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.600
Yeah, I'm playing a cat girl.

23:51.120 --> 23:59.360
Um, and then, um, of course with Dead by Daylight, it, it took some money from me

24:00.200 --> 24:06.040
because, and, um, I actually had wanted to put this in as a story, so I'll just go

24:06.040 --> 24:06.880
ahead and say it now.

24:07.880 --> 24:14.920
Um, the Dead by Daylight DLC is going away as, I'm not Dead by Daylight, but the

24:14.920 --> 24:18.600
Stranger Things DLC is going away as of November 17th, 2021.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.640
Dead by Daylight's closing finally.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.160
Yay.

24:21.160 --> 24:21.880
Good riddance.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.440
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.720
I don't, I've met too many people.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.560
And I think this is also coinciding with chapter 21, which is the Hellraiser

24:28.560 --> 24:30.320
channel or channel chapter.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.080
Um, and those pinhead mechanics.

24:33.080 --> 24:33.800
Oh my God.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.960
I've been watching people play.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.600
I can't do the PTB on Stadia.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.280
We got into it a little bit on last week's show, but we didn't have the

24:39.280 --> 24:40.280
confirmation yet.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.640
We just had that teaser video that made it very clear.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.080
Pretty much.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
Yeah, pretty much.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.960
But, um, yeah, now that we've gotten to see, I can't believe we didn't put it on

24:47.000 --> 24:47.760
show world, but okay.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.440
Um, now that we got to see it, I must've known you'd bring it up.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.280
Uh, now that we got to see it on Tuesday on the PTB, yeah, it looks

24:54.280 --> 24:55.520
like a really fun mechanic.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.800
We'll go back into that in just a second, but let me finish this point.

24:59.360 --> 25:05.360
Um, and I actually have been for anyone who had this DLC on their wishlist.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.240
I have been gifting it to people on Steam.

25:08.120 --> 25:14.920
Um, but the, what this is going to do is it's going to remove the ability to buy

25:14.920 --> 25:23.400
the characters of Demogorgon, Steve or Stoven, as we also call him, uh, and

25:23.400 --> 25:29.560
broccoli, Nancy, I'm sorry, Nancy, um, in Dead by Daylight and the Hawkins level.

25:29.560 --> 25:35.840
Now the Hawkins, uh, laboratory map is going to be completely removed.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.640
It's going to be gone.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.880
Bye-bye Hawkins.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.840
Um, because technically nobody paid for that.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.640
You can, you can play a match on Hawkins without buying a single

25:44.640 --> 25:45.880
piece of Stranger Things DLC.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.440
You're not paying for that technically.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.920
Yeah, but, um, the characters are staying in the game.

25:51.960 --> 25:58.720
Um, but right now, um, all of the characters themselves are available

25:58.720 --> 26:02.160
at 50% off until November 17th.

26:02.920 --> 26:07.600
Um, and all of their cosmetics are 50% off.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.080
So, yeah, I, I bought everybody's cosmetics.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.720
I don't play survivor, but now I can play broccoli and Nancy if I wanted to.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.280
You know what broccoli Nancy is, right?

26:17.320 --> 26:17.560
Oh yeah.

26:17.560 --> 26:17.720
Yeah.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.040
With the, with the particular hair with that hair.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.440
Um, so, so yeah.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.680
Um, and I actually got, sorry, just quickly on the stranger things

26:25.680 --> 26:27.080
before we get off of that topic.

26:27.320 --> 26:33.280
What is interesting about that is that, um, the stranger things three RPG game is

26:33.280 --> 26:36.600
also coming off game pass on September 1st.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.200
So yeah, it's a big license loss.

26:38.240 --> 26:38.400
Yeah.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.760
There's there's Netflix is doing something with the license and what a lot of people

26:41.760 --> 26:45.040
are forecasting that something is ties into a story that came up a couple of

26:45.040 --> 26:48.840
weeks ago on the show about how Netflix is getting into gaming on their own and

26:48.840 --> 26:49.360
doing their own thing.

26:49.360 --> 26:54.080
So the stranger things license would do a lot for their own type of

26:54.080 --> 26:55.280
game and whatever they're doing.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.320
I still don't understand why they had to pull it from dead by daylight.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.960
Cause it's not like, you know, it's not like,

27:01.000 --> 27:05.280
I know why they pulled it because, um, and it's exactly what behavior said.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.520
The license ran out.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.280
And so they didn't, but it isn't, you would think that the Halloween license

27:11.280 --> 27:15.920
ran out by now, but they renew it, you know, so well, but Halloween also

27:15.920 --> 27:21.360
doesn't have any other games except for a pinball table coming out.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.080
True.

27:22.600 --> 27:29.400
Um, and I can certainly see Netflix wanting to do some sort of brand

27:29.400 --> 27:30.280
protection.

27:30.760 --> 27:35.960
They want people to think when they think of a stranger things, video game,

27:36.040 --> 27:40.600
anything having to do with the video game, they want to think of theirs.

27:40.640 --> 27:41.760
It's controlling the market.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.600
That's all it is.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.840
It's controlling perception.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.360
It's advertising end of story.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.840
And there's probably things Netflix doesn't care for about Freddy getting to

27:49.840 --> 27:54.320
put Steve on a hook and that the, the sort of, even though that's the things

27:54.320 --> 27:57.880
the horror fans love and the fans of the game love is that it is all these, you

27:57.920 --> 28:01.800
know, and, and I love the way you've described it, the characters aren't

28:01.800 --> 28:04.240
leaving the game, but I was saying, I love the way you've described this on the

28:04.240 --> 28:07.400
show before, and I use this with other people too, is that it's the, it's the

28:07.400 --> 28:10.160
Marvel cinematic universe of horror and dead by daylight.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.960
Um, and, um, it's, I call it the multiverse, the multiverse, whatever,

28:14.960 --> 28:19.800
but yeah, which is actually the term because the Marvel cinematic universe

28:19.800 --> 28:21.480
is part of the Marvel multiverse.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.320
Got it.

28:22.800 --> 28:30.080
So, and even like in the lore, if you read the observer's, uh, personal logs,

28:30.640 --> 28:36.080
he talks about visiting various versions of Terra as he's calling earth.

28:36.640 --> 28:41.360
And how the entity pulls from multiple realities and crap like that.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.600
So, yeah, so it is a multiversal game at its core.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.160
But, um, now I got into a talk.

28:51.160 --> 28:55.800
I actually got to talk to one of my favorite, uh, YouTube folks, um,

28:56.360 --> 29:01.720
luminous, who does those, uh, 3d, uh, dead by daylight parodies.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.520
You know, the one where Meg has the weird voice.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.280
No, I don't, I don't really watch these.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.120
They're hilarious.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.240
They're absolutely hilarious.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.520
I'll link their, I'll link their channel in here, but we were talking a little

29:12.520 --> 29:15.760
bit about, um, you know, I was like, I wonder if they're just going to reskin

29:15.760 --> 29:20.160
the Hawkins map and maybe make it into the labyrinth and they were like, no,

29:20.160 --> 29:22.080
it wouldn't be right if they did that.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.480
And they probably wouldn't because something about asset usage or whatever.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.040
Um, and I kind of now agree with that sentiment that I hope

29:31.040 --> 29:32.680
that it doesn't happen.

29:32.760 --> 29:37.880
You know, I want Hawkins to stay dead because I'm a killer main.

29:38.320 --> 29:45.600
Um, and I would like to see them do maybe a new map to replace it based

29:45.600 --> 29:49.400
off of the labyrinth and how razor, and I kind of see them doing something

29:49.400 --> 29:55.520
like that, we haven't heard if the DLC is just the hell priest.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.480
It probably is, you know, in the, in the, it better be cheap as

29:59.480 --> 30:00.880
fuck if it's one character.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.640
Yeah, it's, it'll probably be like, you know, I guess like how Bubba was.

30:05.280 --> 30:10.080
Um, I saw an excellent, um, kind of proof of concept or whatever about

30:10.080 --> 30:15.000
turning that Hawkins map into a recording studio for the tricksters lore.

30:15.040 --> 30:15.440
Yeah.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.720
Uh, and I really liked that because like all those little rooms upstairs

30:18.720 --> 30:19.480
make a lot of sense.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.360
The big lab could turn into like a padded wall type of studio.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.360
You know, obviously it would take a lot of work, but I thought that

30:25.360 --> 30:26.880
was a pretty clever rework.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.080
Yeah.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.320
The upstairs was all like offices.

30:29.520 --> 30:29.840
Yeah.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.120
Yeah.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.480
But, but, you know, still make it make a lot of sense.

30:32.480 --> 30:32.760
Yeah.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.240
But I, but I agree.

30:35.240 --> 30:40.320
I agree with, uh, luminous that, um, I don't think that it's going to be

30:40.320 --> 30:44.840
reskinned and I think it might have to do something with asset ownage ownership,

30:45.480 --> 30:52.320
but it could be that they might rework the general layout of it.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.280
Like the bare bones of it into something else.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.120
I mean, I would love for trickster to have, have his own map, you know,

30:59.120 --> 31:01.000
trickster and Eugene to have their own map.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.680
I would love to have the hell labyrinth.

31:03.960 --> 31:09.840
We were also talking that it would be cool to have like DLC based off of like.

31:10.480 --> 31:14.880
The classic vampire monster, because I mean, that's public domain.

31:14.880 --> 31:20.040
You don't need the license like nose for not to, or, or Stoker license,

31:20.040 --> 31:22.560
you know, cause I want to, I want a vampire killer.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.200
Well, I was saying I would love to have just Castlevania.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.760
They can tap on Konami again.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.200
Oh, heck yeah.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.880
But it wouldn't make sense to have your vampire killer with

31:32.880 --> 31:34.320
no power to kill a vampire.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.800
So, eh, but, um, but I was thinking.

31:38.120 --> 31:44.280
It would be interesting to have, like, you have the classic vampire,

31:44.320 --> 31:49.840
but they have the skin that's the Nosferatu style, you know, and then

31:49.840 --> 31:56.600
they have like a, like maybe a Van Helsing, uh, or another vampire

31:56.760 --> 32:01.680
hunter, like descendant who might not actually be a hunter, be the person

32:01.680 --> 32:07.360
as a survivor and that we have like this Gothic castle, you know, cause

32:07.800 --> 32:09.680
we gotta be down with our, our gothiness.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.120
I'm tired of goth Kate.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.440
Enya's castle and all her cats.

32:14.160 --> 32:18.960
No, no, but like there's a lamentable lack of goth.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.440
I mean, there is Kate's little goth outfit, which is kind of, and then

32:24.440 --> 32:30.720
there's, uh, Jeff, uh, in his aging death metal guar fan boy outfit.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.080
Or, or stay with me here.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.320
Picture this.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.680
Sicily works.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.480
Nine, 16, 20.

32:40.480 --> 32:45.920
And we have, and we have vampires that are running around and they're sparkling.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.040
It's the skin of a killer Bella.

32:48.080 --> 32:48.680
Okay.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.080
My wife has been watching the, the, the Twilight series again.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.920
And it's just so stupid.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.880
I don't, I don't give a fuck if Twilight DLC came out, I

32:57.880 --> 32:59.240
would buy it in a heartbeat.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.760
I would buy it in a heartbeat.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.160
It would be so stupid and awesome.

33:03.040 --> 33:03.520
Anyway.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.760
But yeah, but going, going back to all of that.

33:05.760 --> 33:14.320
Yeah, I got all of the cosmetics and everything for, for stove and Nancy.

33:14.760 --> 33:19.600
I even have that terrible Jonathan Byers skin, which we will, he will

33:19.600 --> 33:26.360
never get the Quint, the Quentin facelift, sad face, the Quentin facelift, by the way.

33:27.240 --> 33:27.720
Looks great.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.120
I'm ace and woof.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.320
And David has more chest hair now.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.880
And I'm gay as hell and woof.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.360
To this day, they nerfed the booty on pyramid head.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.360
Just saying.

33:44.120 --> 33:44.840
That was so funny.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.000
That was a naturalist moment.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.680
And you know, I can't call him pee head.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.240
We can't really call him pee pee head anymore because there's

33:50.240 --> 33:52.400
another pee pee head now cause pinhead.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.320
Oh yeah.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.240
Anyway, enough dead by daylight.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.480
Oh, and I tried to get mass effect to run, um, through steam link.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.160
Um, which is funny.

34:03.160 --> 34:10.520
I actually got Gary's mod to run, um, through steam link because, uh, it's

34:10.520 --> 34:12.400
32 bit on Mac, so it won't run.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.920
Um, but I did steam link through my, uh, windows 10 arm through parallels.

34:20.320 --> 34:25.720
And, um, I also got, um, source filmmaker to run.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.960
I'm going to be playing around with that on a project.

34:28.880 --> 34:34.680
And, um, I, I played around in a little hot to full boyfriend.

34:36.320 --> 34:36.760
Excellent.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.000
So I actually did have a gaming week.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.120
I've been sick as balls, but I did get some fun stuff done.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.520
Sometimes that's when I'm able to get my gaming in is when I I'm sick

34:46.520 --> 34:47.480
and I can't really do anything.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.520
Who's who's got Nick related to in.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.360
From Debbie delight.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.040
Um, no Gottmik the drag queen.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.640
I'm looking at, let's see a Tabiri said he had in Gottmik had that pinhead.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.440
Look at the finale.

35:02.240 --> 35:02.960
That's right.

35:03.000 --> 35:03.400
That's right.

35:03.400 --> 35:03.800
That's right.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.120
That's right.

35:04.120 --> 35:04.320
Yeah.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.080
Okay.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.320
So anyway, man, I love Gottmik.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.920
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

35:10.880 --> 35:14.280
Um, so it was mostly Minecraft.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.440
I've been playing a lot of that and working on things.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.080
Still haven't put out a video yet.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.120
Been way behind stuff took longer as usual.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.320
Um, and also your honor.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.200
Yeah.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.040
So like I wanted to, like, I had content that I filmed earlier in the week and

35:30.040 --> 35:34.040
then it just wouldn't work with the order of which I wanted to do things.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.000
So I have to refilm all of it.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.960
I was going to do that last night.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.160
And then the cat decided that she wants to sit here and

35:40.160 --> 35:41.480
scream at me the entire time.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.080
She has like a sixth sense, even though she can't hear of when I'm

35:45.080 --> 35:48.840
about to record something and just sits there just screaming and screaming.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.520
So yeah, that's fine.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.440
But I actually did play another game this week.

35:54.440 --> 35:54.760
Yes.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.640
So there was a demo that came out for WarioWare get it together.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.280
And so I did check that out on the switch because I do

36:03.280 --> 36:05.320
like me some WarioWare games.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.120
And it's all right.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.400
I guess the games are fun.

36:10.480 --> 36:16.720
Um, the, the thing this time is, you know, they have the co-op, they have different

36:16.720 --> 36:18.720
characters, which control differently.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.600
So it can make it a little bit of a challenge when you're playing like a

36:23.600 --> 36:27.560
certain micro game as one character versus another.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.160
So it's a little bit different.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.160
It's not just like, um, you know, having to do the same

36:32.160 --> 36:33.360
motions over and over again.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.040
Um, so you have to figure out kind of how to do the same

36:36.040 --> 36:37.080
thing with different characters.

36:37.080 --> 36:41.240
So that's kind of cool, but like at the same time, some of the characters

36:41.240 --> 36:44.960
are really annoying that I didn't really like them, but they'll probably

36:44.960 --> 36:45.920
check it out when it comes out.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.680
But it seemed a lot harder to me because of that mechanic they had in there.

36:51.120 --> 36:51.440
Okay.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.880
But I totally forgot that came out.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.600
I have to try it.

36:55.240 --> 36:55.520
Yeah.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.640
It's, it's, it's all right.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.320
I mean, it's pretty good.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.440
Um, as you play it more, you unlock more characters and stuff like

37:00.440 --> 37:01.920
that and get to check those out.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.400
Um, sounds like a pretty robust demo.

37:06.080 --> 37:06.520
Yeah.

37:06.560 --> 37:06.840
Yeah.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.160
So definitely check that out.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.480
And the game comes out like 10th or 10th.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.840
So I'll, I'll probably pick it up anyways.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.000
Um, I don't know.

37:14.000 --> 37:14.520
Nice.

37:15.120 --> 37:15.360
Yeah.

37:15.480 --> 37:15.840
Nice.

37:17.200 --> 37:17.480
All right.

37:18.280 --> 37:18.680
All right.

37:18.720 --> 37:18.960
Yeah.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.960
Uh, then we'll talk a little bit about my gaming week.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.160
First off, I want to make sure I plug, uh, the, the shirt that I'm wearing.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.160
I'm sorry, podcast folks.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.280
You can't see the shirt, but I am actually tonight on Twitch wearing,

37:28.480 --> 37:31.360
uh, one of our new newer shirts in the, I shouldn't say new.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.800
It's been there a couple of months, but newer shirts in the store.

37:33.840 --> 37:37.120
Uh, the orange lounge radio shirt that is Sega inspired.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.680
The dark Sakura put together.

37:38.680 --> 37:44.200
So, um, I have this and I bought also the, um, the new VOG network logo, or I

37:44.200 --> 37:46.440
shouldn't say new cause it's not going to replace this, but like that, that

37:46.600 --> 37:50.280
eighties esque, uh, the jet set radio looking, I'm going to call it that the

37:50.280 --> 37:52.440
jet set radio looking VOG network logo.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.520
I got that too.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.840
And both I, I got to wear to dragon con.

37:56.040 --> 38:00.000
If you want to check out the shirt, um, all you have to do is head over to

38:00.000 --> 38:02.440
our store of vognetwork.com slash shop.

38:02.920 --> 38:07.960
Um, As far as my gaming week, um, thank you for linking that in chat, by the

38:07.960 --> 38:11.440
way, uh, and pixel pocket says I have the Sega styled OLR shirt as a tank.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.200
Oh, that's awesome.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.960
I wish I had the body for a tank top, but I don't, uh, maybe someday.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.600
Um, so you know what?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.040
Everybody has a body for a tank.

38:19.120 --> 38:19.560
Yes.

38:19.560 --> 38:19.840
Yes.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.240
That's true.

38:20.240 --> 38:24.160
I shouldn't, but you know, I, I, I just prefer to have my

38:24.160 --> 38:25.360
sleeves covered with this one.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.520
I like the baseball Jersey.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.080
Anyway, you don't get a lot of like baseball Jersey custom shirts.

38:29.200 --> 38:33.000
So I kind of like the streamlabs apps that, um, Anyway, my game of the week,

38:33.040 --> 38:34.720
I totally forgot about the warrior wear demo.

38:34.800 --> 38:39.800
I forgot the Diablo to have that open beta and y'all know, I love Diablo.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.960
Now granted all the other stuff that's been going on.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.800
Maybe that's why it's been kind of out of my head, but I didn't even think

38:45.800 --> 38:49.280
to try it, which by the way, just a reminder, uh, the blizzard employees

38:49.280 --> 38:53.040
have still not been responded to on their, uh, call of action, what

38:53.040 --> 38:56.800
they are looking at from, uh, their bosses and their, uh, higher ups.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.160
Just, just a reminder that still is not resolved.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.080
And I will be mentioning that every week here on this program.

39:02.160 --> 39:07.880
Uh, as I remember to, um, until it is resolved actually, um, As far as other

39:07.880 --> 39:12.400
games I've been playing this week, um, I was continuing on in Hades.

39:12.840 --> 39:18.880
Uh, I actually finally beat Hades, so I got the boss down, but here's the thing.

39:18.880 --> 39:24.440
Once you beat Hades, the game has just begun because there is, there's

39:24.440 --> 39:26.280
much more behind the curve, but I love that game.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.080
It's so good.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.480
Um, but it is, you know, the thing that gets really frustrating about

39:30.480 --> 39:34.320
it is that even though, yes, the builds are really cool, how like you kind

39:34.320 --> 39:35.560
of have to make new ones every time.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.800
I really wish there was something that would let me rerun a particular build.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.360
I just had like a, like a limited use item or something.

39:41.360 --> 39:44.480
It would just be, it'd just be really nice, uh, to be able to do that.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.920
Um, but I still love Hades.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.400
Also been playing Final Fantasy 14 by daylight.

39:49.760 --> 39:54.480
Um, not a lot of new stuff, although I did play a little bit of Haven, which

39:54.480 --> 39:56.240
was a game that was on Xbox game pass.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.360
Um, and that was a very stylish kind of game.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.000
I was doing that just to get an achievement for one of the,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.320
um, uh, little Xbox reward things.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.680
Um, and then I was also trying to do it in grounded.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.520
I actually probably played a little bit more grounded, you know, that game.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.520
That's basically honey.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.560
I shrunk the kids, the game, but they can't call it that.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.720
Um, where you actually play as kids that are in the back.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.960
I didn't realize it was such a crafting heavy game.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.480
Like it almost feels a bit Minecrafty to me.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.120
Like what that game is all about.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.240
So, um, it was neat though.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.840
Um, I enjoyed what I was playing that, but unfortunately, um, it was, um.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.440
It was really hard to get the achievements in that game.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.160
They, they didn't really have any gimmies off the bat.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.160
So, uh, yeah, I had to, I had to just do something.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.640
It was going to be a little bit easier and then yes.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.240
Um, SSU 100 Mountain Chat says, I keep getting distracted.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.200
Quake came out this week and I had to play that.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.320
Bobby Buckle says, I got to play Diablo two, but quake just came out.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.800
I mean, what is this 1999?

40:49.800 --> 40:50.080
Yeah.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.080
Um, I also played a lot of that quake remaster.

40:53.120 --> 40:56.280
I'll, I'll sit on my thoughts until we get to that story later in the show.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.600
Cause I know it's coming up, but I did spend a bit of time on that

40:58.600 --> 41:00.040
Quaker master and I will say.

41:00.840 --> 41:05.440
If you got quake for free when Bethesda net was giving it away.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.040
Do you remember that?

41:06.040 --> 41:09.480
It was about, um, probably about, or was it even last year's quake con?

41:09.680 --> 41:10.560
It might've been a year now.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.760
It might've been last year's quake con.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.400
They were giving away quake one, two, and three for free.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.720
If you pick that up, guess what?

41:15.720 --> 41:16.600
You got a free upgrade.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.320
So, uh, I hope you all pick that up cause, uh, it was

41:21.320 --> 41:22.320
definitely worth it this week.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.240
Um, also really quickly, before we get into gaming news, I do want to

41:26.240 --> 41:27.680
talk about dragon con a little bit.

41:27.680 --> 41:32.560
So I'm going to be going to, um, dragon con on, uh, September.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.680
I would say September 1st, but that's the day I fly out there.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.520
The con itself starts the second and then runs through labor day.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.120
Yes.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.160
It's going to be a weird year.

41:39.160 --> 41:39.440
Yes.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.520
The Delta variant is very real and all this stuff.

41:41.640 --> 41:45.160
Um, but I'm very happy that dragon con is taking a lot of precautions with it.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.040
So masking is going to be mandatory, of course.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.640
And they just announced this week.

41:48.680 --> 41:54.600
You have to, they, they will be checking for vaccination or recent, like, uh, COVID

41:54.600 --> 41:56.320
tests that is not like an over the cat.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.920
There's very all sorts of parameters with it.

41:58.120 --> 42:01.960
So basically, um, confirmation that you really don't have COVID.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.960
Um, so I'm very happy for that.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.120
So, uh, it's going to be half the attendance though.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.600
Um, so I understand there's probably a lot of people who might sit

42:09.600 --> 42:10.640
out this year and that's fine.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.880
But if you are going to go.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.000
I can finally tell you about the panels I'm going to be on.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.680
I said, I wasn't going to announce them until they were in the Apple.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.240
Guess what?

42:18.440 --> 42:21.440
The app came out this week and all of my panels are in there.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.360
So I'm going to quickly tell you what I'm doing at dragon con.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.400
And I will also tell you which ones are streaming live.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.880
Um, because for those that don't want to go, um, because of everything going

42:29.880 --> 42:32.800
on in the world, um, you can still catch a lot of them live.

42:33.160 --> 42:39.240
So, uh, first panel Friday, 1130 AM, these are all Eastern time video

42:39.600 --> 42:43.480
didn't kill the radio star tips for doing an audio podcast on video

42:43.480 --> 42:44.640
that will be streaming live.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.120
Um, that's a panel Bobby and I pitched a couple of years ago that we've

42:48.120 --> 42:51.640
done a few times now because we have this experience of taking this long

42:51.640 --> 42:53.960
running audio show and moving it to Twitch.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.280
And we kind of want to talk to other people that, um, are maybe looking

42:57.280 --> 43:01.200
at doing something similar where they've been doing, uh, a lot of, uh,

43:01.240 --> 43:03.960
audio stuff and they're going to make the move to video and we kind of

43:03.960 --> 43:06.000
talk about some of the things we've learned from it and some of the

43:06.000 --> 43:07.360
things we think are best practices.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.840
Uh, yeah, and Bobby points out in chat, this is technically the VOG panel,

43:10.920 --> 43:11.920
but we have guests on it.

43:11.920 --> 43:17.080
It's not just Bobby and I, uh, I love this Friday at 1 PM on digital media.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.400
This will also be streamed live.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.600
I'm going to be on a panel called neighborhoods over numbers.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.760
These are people that enjoy broadcasting because of the communities

43:25.760 --> 43:28.880
and the people they meet and they don't care about numbers so much.

43:29.320 --> 43:32.600
If ever there was a panel meant for me, and this wasn't even my pitch,

43:32.600 --> 43:33.960
I don't think, was it Bobby?

43:34.480 --> 43:37.080
I don't even remember which fucking panels we pitched.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.440
I don't think we pitched this.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.280
I think somebody else did.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.240
And I was like, Oh, I wish I had thought of that.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.280
I should be on that panel.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.480
So, um, neighborhoods over numbers, that's Friday at one o'clock.

43:45.920 --> 43:52.600
Um, then over on the gaming track Friday at two 30 head canons, welcome

43:52.720 --> 43:55.720
how games create personalized stories.

43:56.120 --> 44:00.440
And I thought, Oh gosh, I get into Loki and Jamie's head

44:00.440 --> 44:02.360
cannon so much here on this program.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.440
This would be a great panel for me to moderate.

44:04.680 --> 44:08.440
So we're going to do a panel on head cannons and, uh, the personalized

44:08.440 --> 44:09.520
stories you take away from the game.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.040
And I think a lot of the recent dead by daylight combo is really going to

44:12.040 --> 44:14.120
kind of help in that particular arena.

44:14.720 --> 44:18.000
Um, the pros and cons about being on a network.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.440
Uh, this is a very, they've done this on the digital media track.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.800
A lot of times it's just about, should you network up with other

44:23.880 --> 44:27.880
shows or, or, you know, other, um, you know, existing podcast networks or not.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.960
So that'll be Friday at four o'clock.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.120
I have a very, that's my fourth panel on Friday.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600
And, um, that's it.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.080
I have four panels on Friday alone then on Sunday.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.040
So I guess I have Saturday off.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.400
I just realized I don't have a single panel on Saturday.

44:42.400 --> 44:42.920
I really don't.

44:42.920 --> 44:43.320
All right.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.640
On Sunday, I have a panel called from inception to posting.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.240
Let's get you published.

44:49.520 --> 44:53.200
And this one is about, um, just the basic steps for how to

44:53.200 --> 44:54.120
get your content out there.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.880
So, um, I, I know a little bit about that, so we'll talk about that.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.560
That is also going to be streaming live.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.720
And then I have another panel called gender unlocked

45:03.000 --> 45:04.920
character creation for everyone.

45:05.120 --> 45:11.320
So that is Sunday at four o'clock where, uh, we'll talk about, uh, the character

45:11.320 --> 45:16.240
creators with, uh, expanded gender expression and what games have done this

45:16.240 --> 45:17.680
well and what games have missed the mark.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.120
Now, Bobby, you're going to get a kick out of this.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.880
Do you remember how you were saying you lost a panel?

45:24.640 --> 45:27.720
I think I did too, because it's no longer in the app.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.000
So unfortunately it looks like, ah, that's a bummer.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.720
I was really looking forward to that one too, but unfortunately it's

45:33.720 --> 45:35.080
no longer showing in the app.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.280
So I guess I can't tell you about it.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.160
Do you want to hear about it?

45:38.160 --> 45:38.960
You want to know what the panel was?

45:38.960 --> 45:39.840
I was really excited to do that.

45:39.840 --> 45:40.080
Okay.

45:40.080 --> 45:40.520
I'm gonna tell you.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.160
So I was supposed to be doing, it's not, I maybe, maybe it's just.

45:46.480 --> 45:46.760
Yeah.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.000
May I, it's not there.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.160
So I'm left to assume it is canceled at this point, but if it comes back,

45:51.160 --> 45:56.120
I'll let you know, um, it was going to be a ZeniMax panel and it was the art of

45:56.120 --> 46:02.160
ZeniMax, ZeniMax, of course, being the company behind, um, Skyrim, Fallout.

46:02.640 --> 46:03.920
I was going to be one of the artists.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.800
So I imagine that artist probably pulled out of the show, unfortunately.

46:07.040 --> 46:07.560
But I get it.

46:07.720 --> 46:08.440
It is what it is.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.080
Uh, oh man.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.120
I was looking forward to that one, but yeah, that was, that was probably

46:12.120 --> 46:14.240
going to be my biggest, my biggest panel.

46:14.520 --> 46:15.040
That's all right.

46:15.320 --> 46:15.520
Yeah.

46:15.520 --> 46:16.000
Too bad.

46:17.120 --> 46:17.880
But I understand.

46:17.880 --> 46:21.440
So, so Bobby, it wasn't just you that, uh, lost a panel.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.160
It happens.

46:24.200 --> 46:24.560
It happens.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.000
All right.

46:25.480 --> 46:29.080
Uh, but that's my lineup for, so six panels at Dragon Con that I'm going

46:29.080 --> 46:30.800
to be doing, uh, but I'm really excited.

46:30.800 --> 46:35.360
And you know, with these, uh, celebrities that are dropping out and things

46:35.360 --> 46:38.760
changing around a little bit, I imagine there will be a panel that shows up

46:38.760 --> 46:42.720
that I don't know about, so we'll, uh, get to that, uh, I'll let you know

46:42.720 --> 46:43.880
as soon as I know more about that.

46:44.200 --> 46:44.600
All right.

46:44.920 --> 46:48.400
Uh, let's move on and get into some gaming news and stuff that's going

46:48.400 --> 46:50.200
around on around the gaming world.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.000
So Loki, we'll start with you.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.720
Cause I know you're excited about this.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.720
I am very excited.

46:55.720 --> 47:02.880
So yes, us, the, uh, saints row, uh, social media team has been teasing

47:03.200 --> 47:05.200
an announcement coming this week.

47:05.280 --> 47:11.600
Um, so they put out a, just a, a piece of graffiti show and Waltz does

47:11.600 --> 47:16.200
rebooting and basically saying that saints row is being rebooted.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.440
Uh, we're going to find out about it.

47:18.600 --> 47:24.200
Thanks to Jeff Keeley's opening night games, calm show, uh, which is going to

47:24.200 --> 47:30.200
be coming out, I think Wednesday, if I remember correctly, Wednesday at 11 AM,

47:30.560 --> 47:37.080
uh, Pacific time, 2 PM Eastern time, uh, August 25th, so definitely

47:37.080 --> 47:38.720
going to be tuning into that.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.560
I am super excited to see what's coming.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.680
I don't care if it's garbage.

47:44.720 --> 47:48.040
A little bit care that if it's garbage, I don't want it to be like, you know,

47:48.040 --> 47:53.320
agents of mayhem garbage, but it's pretty hard to, you know, not

47:53.320 --> 47:56.000
give me the buy that game day one.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.560
Now that said, if it sucks, sure.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.480
I'll complain about it, but I'm still going to buy it day one.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.080
And I mean, so absolutely.

48:04.080 --> 48:04.920
We'll be picking this up.

48:04.920 --> 48:06.000
I picked up all the other ones.

48:06.000 --> 48:06.480
Why not?

48:06.720 --> 48:10.640
Um, so yeah, that, that is something that's coming and hopefully we get

48:10.640 --> 48:12.200
some announcements of remasters as well.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.360
I know three was remastered while ago.

48:14.760 --> 48:18.480
Two was being kind of worked on by one person.

48:18.560 --> 48:22.160
Um, I think it was the idle ninja still working on that.

48:22.560 --> 48:27.320
Um, so I don't know if that's ever going to be remastered or, you know,

48:27.320 --> 48:30.640
I think he was porting over stuff or like fixing some bugs and stuff.

48:30.640 --> 48:34.920
Cause they finally got the source code back, but yeah, I I'm, I'm down.

48:35.120 --> 48:40.720
I just hope it's as crazy as three, not as crazy as four, four little too goofy.

48:41.280 --> 48:44.280
Also too derivative of like the goddamn matrix.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.960
Like, yeah, I get it.

48:45.960 --> 48:49.640
Matrix is cool and all, but like, do we really need to do matrix

48:49.640 --> 48:51.720
references this late in the game?

48:51.840 --> 48:52.880
Um, please don't.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.680
So I am curious to see what they do with that.

48:55.680 --> 49:00.880
Cause honestly, like, I don't know, the grand theft auto, like I just can't go

49:00.880 --> 49:02.320
in the grand theft auto online anymore.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.800
It's just like, not for me anymore.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.800
I don't know what happened to that.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.280
Serious.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.800
Mike Defton chat says, I don't know.

49:08.800 --> 49:09.560
What's more funny.

49:09.560 --> 49:12.680
Loki's cam doing the thing it does, or Rob trying to contain his laughter.

49:12.680 --> 49:17.320
I can't help it when Loki's camera does that camera one, camera two, camera one.

49:17.800 --> 49:21.800
It's just really funny to me, especially because this is such a big story.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.840
I know he's really excited about that.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.560
His computer's just deciding to go, did you mean to use this camera instead?

49:28.560 --> 49:29.640
It's like, we get the distance.

49:30.360 --> 49:31.640
I think it's the software.

49:31.640 --> 49:35.240
It's just this X split V cam software keeps switching it.

49:35.240 --> 49:39.160
Like it loses connection to the, to the camera, which obviously it's.

49:40.520 --> 49:44.920
It works all the other times when I'm doing stuff, but for some reason

49:44.920 --> 49:46.880
it's like, yeah, can't do it.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.040
I love that.

49:48.120 --> 49:48.560
All right.

49:48.960 --> 49:49.360
Whatever.

49:49.680 --> 49:50.120
Anyway.

49:50.160 --> 49:54.520
Uh, so what do you think it's going to be like a redoing of one of the games?

49:54.560 --> 49:57.760
Or do you think it's like a reboot for the whole franchise in general?

49:57.800 --> 50:02.600
So technically it could still be sort of in Canon because, so.

50:03.240 --> 50:07.120
Get out of hell, which was the last Saints Row game that they put out, which

50:07.120 --> 50:12.080
is basically just kind of taking the Saints Row three or four engine again,

50:12.080 --> 50:14.520
and doing yet another game with that.

50:14.560 --> 50:18.320
Again, it's basically the same sort of game play.

50:18.440 --> 50:18.880
Oh yeah.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.720
The hell had like three different endings that you could pick from.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.880
One of them was like rebooting the whole franchise.

50:24.920 --> 50:28.320
Like one of them actually had them as cops, which is weird, but, um,

50:28.360 --> 50:30.160
hold up, hold up, hold up.

50:30.200 --> 50:33.640
So they had an ending where you chose basically one of three paths and that

50:33.640 --> 50:35.840
would like, so it's a rift on mass effect.

50:38.080 --> 50:38.560
I think.

50:38.600 --> 50:38.960
Yes.

50:39.000 --> 50:39.320
Okay.

50:39.360 --> 50:43.080
They're not fully the, the later games weren't full of original ideas.

50:43.080 --> 50:48.280
Unfortunately, um, no, that's like some of the other games were like, they

50:48.280 --> 50:52.280
started off like Saints Row was kind of like, I don't know if it was

50:52.280 --> 50:53.920
trying to take itself seriously.

50:54.440 --> 50:58.200
The first one took itself somewhat seriously and they did

50:58.200 --> 51:00.040
like some goofy stuff in there.

51:00.360 --> 51:04.360
Um, but still we're going for like a grand theft auto vibe, which is totally fine.

51:04.360 --> 51:08.200
The two went a little bit more crazy and then they kind of did

51:08.200 --> 51:09.400
their own unique things with it.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.080
Like for example, they had like some mini games that were kind of unique,

51:13.080 --> 51:16.760
like septic Avenger, where you sprayed poop on things that was hilarious.

51:17.120 --> 51:22.440
Um, like the, the, uh, insurance fraud is always fun, you know, jumping

51:22.440 --> 51:25.560
in front of cars, ragdolling and stuff like that, like that, that's fun.

51:25.960 --> 51:30.000
And they even have like some fun, unique multiplayer, uh,

51:30.120 --> 51:31.720
components to the game as well.

51:32.720 --> 51:37.520
It was like the first game to have co-op gameplay throughout the storyline.

51:37.840 --> 51:41.880
Like you couldn't do that in grand theft auto four, you could play the whole

51:41.880 --> 51:44.400
storyline co-op and that's pretty awesome.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.960
Um, it also supported system link, which back in the day, like when you're doing

51:48.960 --> 51:53.680
land stuff, like that was absolutely fantastic grand theft auto four didn't

51:53.680 --> 51:57.520
support that and you can't even play through the storyline co-op now in

51:57.520 --> 52:00.760
grand theft auto five, I mean, granted now they have their own storyline and,

52:00.800 --> 52:04.720
and grand theft auto online, but like you, it's still not something you could have

52:04.720 --> 52:09.840
done and then three and four just kind of regurgitated the same stuff over and

52:09.840 --> 52:14.880
over again, like they just basically took the same missions, didn't even really like

52:14.880 --> 52:19.120
kind of get creative with the mini games so much, it was just like kind of, Ooh,

52:19.120 --> 52:20.520
we're ripping off Tron now.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.120
Ooh, we're ripping off the matrix.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.600
Ooh, we're ripping off mass effect.

52:23.600 --> 52:28.640
Like you could do a little bit, some nods and stuff and make it funny, but like,

52:29.040 --> 52:32.960
come on, like, I don't know, you can do way better than that.

52:33.320 --> 52:36.480
And so it just felt like kind of a rush job with some of these things.

52:36.520 --> 52:40.840
And I know that saints are a four wasn't supposed to be like the way it is.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.520
They had like the whole dominatrix thing.

52:42.520 --> 52:47.560
And then I think they even did like deleted like DLCs type stuff with it as

52:47.560 --> 52:52.520
well, but it was kind of a mess to be, to be honest, but like, I am very curious

52:52.520 --> 52:56.080
to see what a modern day saints road would look like in a modern day engine

52:56.080 --> 52:58.280
on next gen, you know, current gen.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.040
Um, systems and stuff.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.800
I really want to see what it looks like.

53:01.800 --> 53:04.400
Cause it's been a long time since we had a saints road game.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.120
It has been a little bit of the remasters.

53:06.200 --> 53:06.680
Yeah.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.240
Been a very long time.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.360
So, um, I'm very excited.

53:11.400 --> 53:11.600
Yeah.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.920
I, I really can't wait.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.000
All right.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.160
Well, we'll see.

53:15.160 --> 53:19.160
I just, just think next episode of OLR, we have a new saints road

53:19.160 --> 53:20.200
game to talk about Loki.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.920
So we'll get all the details of games com be good.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.040
Especially if they do like a trailer in the trailer.

53:26.200 --> 53:26.680
Oh God.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.400
I hope they do a really good trailer for it.

53:28.400 --> 53:31.760
Like they do a three with like a power in the background.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.320
Oh, just chef's kiss.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.280
Like perfect.

53:35.320 --> 53:35.840
That was great.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.560
And even the mission that was perfect.

53:37.720 --> 53:40.520
Like, so saints road three gets so much stuff, right?

53:40.640 --> 53:43.720
But then they just like, there's also a lot of stuff that they get wrong with that.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.520
And I look, let's focus on what they do.

53:46.520 --> 53:46.840
Right.

53:46.880 --> 53:47.960
Let's let's go that way.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.400
All right.

53:49.640 --> 53:50.080
All right.

53:50.280 --> 53:53.600
Let's move on and talk about another series that gets people really amped up.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.600
That's Pokemon.

53:55.080 --> 53:59.440
Pokemon had a, a kind of a special little direct of their own this week.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.840
And we got some updates on brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.920
We got to see a little bit more of what those games look like.

54:05.960 --> 54:09.040
In fact, we also learned a little bit more about the grand underground.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.160
So it almost sounds like there's kind of like a, it kind of since things

54:12.160 --> 54:15.160
that sound a little bit like the wild area from the newer Pokemon games, but

54:15.160 --> 54:18.000
kind of like this underground area in these games, that could be very interesting.

54:18.760 --> 54:23.440
Also the super contest will come back as super contest shows and you can

54:23.440 --> 54:26.360
socialize with other trainers in the union room and you get to

54:26.360 --> 54:29.200
personalize your capsule decoration.

54:29.200 --> 54:29.600
So.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.080
Some of the features that'll be coming to that game.

54:32.280 --> 54:36.920
Also Pokemon home compatibility, which isn't surprising, but that'll come in 2022.

54:37.320 --> 54:42.160
Also a very special Nintendo switch light, Dialga and Palkia.

54:42.440 --> 54:46.080
Those special editions will be coming on Friday, November 5th.

54:47.480 --> 54:52.920
And yes, I saw that as Mike Deaf points out in chat, Pokemon contests equal

54:52.920 --> 54:54.200
Pokemon rhythm game.

54:54.360 --> 54:54.760
Yeah.

54:54.760 --> 54:57.720
That's, uh, that's what I've, uh, I've heard.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.560
Um, so I'm interested in that and checking that out.

55:00.560 --> 55:03.880
I'm actually, I feel like I'm more excited about these than Shane is.

55:03.880 --> 55:07.360
Cause I don't think Shane's a huge fan of gen four, uh, and he wasn't

55:07.400 --> 55:10.760
really big on the reboot, uh, the early stuff, I think he was a little

55:10.760 --> 55:14.000
more on board with the, uh, that was the impression I got from him after

55:14.000 --> 55:17.080
this direct, but I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm gonna play it.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.520
I'm gonna buy these games, bring them on.

55:19.320 --> 55:23.600
Uh, now a game that I know Shane is very excited about, and I'm excited

55:23.600 --> 55:27.880
about this one too, is Pokemon Legends Arceus, uh, and this is one where

55:27.880 --> 55:30.920
it's also in the Sinnoh region, but it's way in the past, it's not

55:30.920 --> 55:33.560
connected directly to any of the games.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.840
Uh, and it has that mixed starter base, right?

55:36.840 --> 55:40.640
Where you can, uh, be Rowlet, Cyndaquil or Oshawott, uh, which is

55:40.640 --> 55:42.840
kind of neat that it mixes up the gens.

55:42.840 --> 55:46.720
And we found out in this presentation, there are kind of some new Pokemon

55:46.720 --> 55:50.480
in like that whole, you know how they do, like, there were Alolan

55:50.480 --> 55:52.600
Pokemon and Galar Pokemon.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.400
Well, now there's going to be, um, Suian.

55:55.440 --> 55:59.040
Uh, so like Braver, Bravery, Braviary, uh, has one.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.480
Growlithe has a very unique looking one too.

56:01.480 --> 56:04.800
So there's going to be some newish Pokemon in this as well.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.280
And then the other big announcement, uh, during the, uh, Pokemon direct

56:08.280 --> 56:10.720
was that Pokemon Unite will come out.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.280
Their MOBA will come out on mobile phones September 22nd.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.840
So enjoy that.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.680
And, uh, I guess there's some other little things too, if you want to

56:18.680 --> 56:23.080
talk about Pokemon Go and how weird it is that Gen 8 Pokemon are suddenly

56:23.080 --> 56:26.800
in the game when we did, we just skipped Gen 7 and went right to Gen 8.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.320
Um, okay.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.240
So, but not the starters, not the starters.

56:32.240 --> 56:35.920
I guess, I guess it's not legit until the starters are there, but, uh, still,

56:35.920 --> 56:38.080
it's still a little weird in that game right now, but okay.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.240
Um, but there you go.

56:40.240 --> 56:41.680
That was the Pokemon announcements.

56:41.760 --> 56:48.040
So, uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog and network, um, E3 VL and

56:48.040 --> 56:53.040
chat says disappointed it's the light edition and not regular switch or switch.

56:53.040 --> 56:53.920
Oh, led.

56:53.920 --> 56:56.000
Oh, good observation that it's not the switch.

56:56.000 --> 56:56.640
Oh, led.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.920
I didn't even think of that, but yeah.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.440
So it's going to be a little bit of the older ones.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.880
So that's, um, that's too bad.

57:03.880 --> 57:04.400
All right.

57:04.800 --> 57:09.040
Speaking of the switch, I was going to say like our switch is having issues now.

57:09.040 --> 57:12.760
My, my doc, my, I had it, so I bought two docs.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.000
I had a doc that came with it.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.600
I bought another doc cause they originally I was playing on the switch

57:17.640 --> 57:22.080
near my PC to stream from it or whatever to like do gameplay capture.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.240
So I want a doc for that.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.520
So I had a spare just sitting around.

57:25.520 --> 57:27.680
So the first doc stopped charging the switch.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.760
I put the second doc down.

57:29.800 --> 57:34.320
Now it's starting to like the power light, certain of flash on it too.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.680
So it's dying as well.

57:35.680 --> 57:39.040
It's like, I don't know what it is when Nintendo hardware, at least

57:39.040 --> 57:43.080
in this, the switch generation, but it's not to the standard that previous

57:43.080 --> 57:44.560
generations have been, that's for sure.

57:44.800 --> 57:46.880
Mine spin just normal.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.800
I don't have that problem.

57:47.800 --> 57:48.240
That's weird.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.560
But I always, my switch is also also almost always sitting in that doc.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.520
So interesting.

57:53.200 --> 57:53.520
Yeah.

57:53.560 --> 57:56.480
Me going to dragon con will be the first time in a while that that thing

57:56.480 --> 57:58.000
is out of the doc for like a week.

57:58.360 --> 57:59.720
So it's interesting.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.080
All right.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.640
Well, moving on, keep mine docs all the time.

58:03.640 --> 58:07.760
So I, I, yeah, I'd say like 99% of the time my, uh, switch is docked.

58:07.760 --> 58:10.600
So I'm, I'm kind of shocked to hear that this is something that can happen.

58:10.600 --> 58:13.720
I can't imagine what would, what would happen if the doc stopped working?

58:13.720 --> 58:14.680
I'd be so mad.

58:15.240 --> 58:15.680
All right.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.800
Uh, moving on dark soccer, you have something for us.

58:19.480 --> 58:19.960
I do.

58:19.960 --> 58:22.200
And by the way, I forgot to mention something about this wig.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.480
This is for my Legion cosplay.

58:25.160 --> 58:25.800
Oh, random.

58:25.800 --> 58:26.000
Okay.

58:26.000 --> 58:26.560
I didn't know that.

58:26.880 --> 58:27.200
Yeah.

58:27.200 --> 58:31.840
I'm going to be doing, uh, one of the Julie cosmetics.

58:31.840 --> 58:38.720
So I've got the white mask on order and you know, anyway, so yeah, neat preview.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.080
Anyway.

58:40.120 --> 58:46.840
Um, uh, I, I almost hate saying the company's name because it just

58:46.840 --> 58:48.880
leaves this bad taste in my mouth.

58:48.880 --> 58:58.480
It's it's, uh, but Activision is going to be omitting its logo from, uh, well,

58:58.480 --> 58:59.560
actually it already did it.

58:59.560 --> 59:05.040
It left their logo out of a call of duty trailer and said it was a creative choice.

59:05.960 --> 59:13.720
And I mean, it's almost a, a full omission of any reference to

59:13.720 --> 59:16.120
Activision as being any part of it.

59:16.880 --> 59:23.640
Um, it said it opened with call of duty presents instead of Activision presents.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.920
No logo, nothing.

59:25.920 --> 59:30.720
Um, the only mention of Activision is this is in the small print

59:31.080 --> 59:33.200
that, but this actually legally required.

59:33.760 --> 59:40.680
So, um, it also omitted its logo from the call of duty Vanguard pre-order page.

59:41.160 --> 59:45.960
Um, and there was a request for comment that was put forward and all they

59:45.960 --> 59:48.440
said was that it was a creative choice.

59:49.080 --> 59:52.040
But I mean, really, we know what this shit's about.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.680
We know exactly what this shit is about.

59:56.200 --> 59:59.480
They're in the, trying to distance from the, uh, uh, stuff

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.320
that's in the media right now.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.080
And you know what?

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.360
It's not going to work.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.360
Everyone knows that Activision is behind call of duty.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.040
Every Activision studio, literally every Activision

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.480
studio is behind call of duty.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.080
Exactly.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.280
So, I mean, they made their bed time to light.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.520
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says most casuals don't, well, we're here to educate.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.720
Did you know Activision makes call of duty and it's that same company

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.680
that's all in the news right now.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.880
So, all right.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.600
Uh, let's move on to another big game doing interesting things.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:34.920
Loki.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.280
I don't know.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.120
I don't think you're giving people enough credit, you know?

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:40.840
All right.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.560
Loki.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:42.800
Yeah.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.000
So Epic Games is a big game.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.360
Loki.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.640
Yeah.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.680
So Epic Games has announced their totally original brand new, um, game mode that's

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.920
coming to the Fortnite called imposters.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.680
Uh, it's a 10 player, uh, mode where you, I know this is going

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.240
to sound completely unique.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.400
Um, you are trying to attempt who is trying to sabotage your

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.280
team and vote the imposters out.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.720
Yeah, they ripped off, uh, among us.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.040
Well, what about those who would say that among us wasn't technically

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.280
exactly an original idea, but I would, I would say it kind of goes back.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.360
Like, I almost feel like the thing that among us is based on is basically

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.640
public domain at this point.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.640
Like it's one of those things where the, and I, I completely understand

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.960
there are technically like books and card decks and stuff for the

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.280
werewolf game, the mafia game.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:41.160
But the fact that like, there are so many variations of this same, you know, imposter

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.680
vote them out type of game, um, I think just goes to show that, that, you know,

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.040
that format is everywhere in many, many different forms, but I think the way

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.600
that Epic has kind of implemented this.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.680
A lot of people are noting is, is pretty shameless.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:01.520
Like it is, it's, it's much more adjacent to among us than a simple imposter

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.800
clone game ought to be, if that makes sense.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.160
It's very, it's very much like a quick kind of copy, you know, copy paste of it.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.080
Sure.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:18.160
It's in the, you know, aesthetics of, you know, Fortnite, but like, I mean,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.520
even like look at Fortnite, Fortnite's derivative as well of like, you know,

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.000
the battle royale games, you know, basically just totally looked like,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.400
you know, player unknown was doing.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.680
Um, I don't know.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.640
Like, I think it's just really, really shitty.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.360
I'm considering that, you know, the one, of course, everyone wanted to know, well,

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.520
what do the developers of among us think?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.160
And they basically said, listen, we didn't patent the mechanic.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.080
Um, they don't think it leads to a healthy game industry.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.880
Is it really hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.080
So like,

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.840
So they didn't say we think it's shit, but they kind of alluded to it.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.600
Well, I'm sorry.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.360
This, this is somebody else coming in on, so Innersloth, yeah, they basically said,

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:07.240
you know, that they, you know, patent to those mechanics, but like, yeah,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.440
there's other people.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:14.520
Um, yeah, so basically that was a comment by the Marcus Bromander,

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.080
who was the co-founder of Innersloth.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.720
Um, but yeah, I agree.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.200
I think it is kind of dumb.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:30.440
Also the map that they have in the game is very similar to the among us,

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.600
like the standard map in among us as well.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.680
So it's like, come on you guys.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.640
Like, can you make it a little less like that?

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.240
I mean, you're a big company.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.640
It's like, can't you be satisfied with the money that you're making as it is with Fortnite?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.360
Do you really need to go start knocking off other games?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.840
Well, I guess they're kind of a little late to the party.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.280
I feel like, I feel like among us kind of already peaked and no disrespect to those

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.080
developers who've had huge success and you know, all the deserved awards and recognition

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.320
stuff, but I also kind of feel like among us in pop culture kind of already peaked.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.480
So I kind of feel like Epic is late to the party with this.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.440
And quite frankly, they deserve it.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.480
I just don't think it's going to take off, honestly.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.840
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't think it's going to take off very well.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.520
I think people will see it for what it is.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.240
Yeah, um, no, Ariana Grande was much more impactful to Epic than this will be.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.680
Yeah, I think that that's something more interesting.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.360
That's something unique that they're doing.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.000
Yeah, but it's like, oh, hey, we're going to rip off, you know, someone's game mode or whatever.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:30.960
That's fine.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.280
You can you can do like the whole thing, because like hell, I mean, even when we were playing like

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.840
Q's are laser tag and stuff, they had a mode called spy that you had to figure out, you know,

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.720
who was the spy didn't vote anybody out or anything like that.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.360
But it's it's similar to that.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:50.480
They could have taken like the espionage type of thing and done something unique with it.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.640
But instead, what they do, they just, hey, let's copy it among us and let's let's make it as

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.360
let's make it legally distinct.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:06.480
Basically, as as as little as we need to do to make it distinct from among us, but keep it as close as possible.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.520
I mean, let's let's have them.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.000
Why not?

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.720
Hey, you know, why not at this point, let's just have them rip off like, you know, other games as well.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.680
Where's our fall guys?

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.800
You know, where's the obstacle course things for, you know, Fortnite?

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.080
Why not?

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.280
Let's jump on that bandwagon to going to chat E3 VL and chat says it's like fappy birds.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280
I think you meant to say flappy birds, but we'll go with it.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.720
Where is the fappy bird mode in Fortnite?

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.760
I think it's a good question.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.040
I guess I guess that kind of came and went.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.560
SSU 100 Matt in chat says the among us team is kind of that little engine that did.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.920
And this stings a little more that a big company is copying them.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.440
Also, the among us team is cute and super humble.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.880
Yeah. And I think that's exactly that.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:07.600
I think that's why a lot of people are coming to the table kind of basically going like, yo, fuck Epic in this story, especially when, you know, Tim Sweeney tries and fails time and time again to bring this BDE to the table that he just doesn't have, you know, when it comes to.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:31.600
But Epic's the little guy taking on these other companies and it's like, you it almost kind of like, really, it really looks bad in the scope of like him trying to do that parody ad with Big Brother and all that stuff about we're taking on the big mean companies when it's like, the fuck are you doing to Inner Sloth right now, Tim Sweeney and company?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.200
Like, I think that's why there's a lot of people in this scenario that it's like, it's very transparent what Epic is doing.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.640
It's very shitty and fuck them with something hard and sandpapery, like, especially Tim Sweeney.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.280
I loved ZZT, but, um, you know what?

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.120
That was a long time ago.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.440
It was a long, long time ago.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.480
You were a different person.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.520
I was a different person.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.360
You've changed.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.400
Uh, what's that?

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.360
I said, oh, Rob.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:06:59.840
Oh, me.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.120
Uh, E3VL says Sony tried to copy Smash.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.280
Didn't turn out that well.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.120
Actually, some people really defend the shit out of that game.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.720
And I get it.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.400
I do.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.600
Um, Tiger Claw in chat says, if you want a good game, you might as well copy from the best.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.200
Am I right?

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.680
Um, that isn't instantly going to make it good though.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.800
I mean, I get where your like tongue and cheek comment comes from, but like that isn't going to make it good.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:28.840
But when games are a little bit derivative, um, some, and kind of do their own thing with it and bring new things to the table, I think they do very well.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.880
For example, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do something real close to home for Tiger Claw because I know where his fandoms lie.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.200
So let's talk about the Ninja Turtle arcade game by, by Konami.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.840
Now that game is an excellent game.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.680
Don't get me wrong.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.280
And why is that an excellent game?

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:49.480
Because it took something like what you would see in a game like Final Fight by Capcom, which was huge in the genre at the time.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.280
But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles did its own thing.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.080
And it was that whole fact that you had the four characters that were all very distinctive.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:04.120
And who remembers when you were knocking shit at the screen and how like the, the enemies would hit the screen and there was like the item use it.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:04.880
But let's be real.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.960
The format is very similar to Final Fight and other games before it.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.640
I mean, Golden Axe, if you want, it was kind of a very similar type of thing.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:20.640
So sometimes you take a template from the best, but you improve on it in your own way.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:27.880
And that's why something like that is successful and where Fortnite could have been maybe a little more successful.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:33.280
But again, I think they kind of they kind of they kind of hit the genre after it after it passed.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.400
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.200
Tiger Claw brings up, to be fair, Final Fight wouldn't have been around if it wasn't for Double Dragon.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.680
You're you know what? You're right on that.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.640
I just happen to think of Final Fight first.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.480
But you're right. Double Dragon did it before.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.960
But there were, you know, was was Golden Axe before Double Dragon?

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.720
I can't remember.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.840
But I know that that fighting genre has has evolved quite a ways, you know, over the years.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.240
So Double Dragon was eighty seven.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.680
OK, that probably was the first one then, because I think Golden Axe was eighty eight or eighty.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.440
I could be wrong, though. Golden Axe was eighty nine.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.400
Oh, wow. OK.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:19.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, we'll see how this Nickelodeon smash like fighting game goes.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.320
Folks are hyped about it, even though it's a copy of Smash with their IPs.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.360
Well, the the question is, will they do something different with it beyond just the characters?

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.680
Obviously, will they be able to do something different with it?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.680
And will Lori Beth Denberg be playable?

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.520
Yes or no? She better be the announcer, if nothing like if Lori Beth Denberg is not the announcer of this game, I reject it.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.360
Anyway, or or what was her name on guts?

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.880
The referee, she had like a Moira Moira.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.480
That's it. She had like a New Zealand accent.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:53.440
Yes, Moira Moira could also be the announcer.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.200
And I didn't think she was from New Zealand.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.360
I think she was British.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.720
I thought she had a maybe.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.040
Oh, well, anyway, she was she definitely had an accent of some sort.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.440
I remember that. So. All right.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Anyhow, let's Moira Quirk.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.320
Where was she from? You got the Wiki up?

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.680
I'm looking. She's from London.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.720
OK. All right. She's English.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.200
You got me. All right.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.480
DJ Rama S in chat says, have you been listening to Lori Beth's podcast?

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.320
No, I haven't. And you brought that up before and I need to get on that.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.200
So I will correct that soon. My bad.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:34.080
All right, moving on, let's talk about an interesting history making moment overseas.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.000
The Nintendo Switch has swept Japan's game sales chart,

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.400
meaning every entry in the top five is from switch.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.640
Actually, it's every entry in the top 10 is on this.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.160
Actually, it's every entry in the top 30.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.880
And that's where I'm going to end is a Nintendo switch up 30.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.800
The top 30 games are all on the Nintendo Switch in Japan right now.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.120
And that is up against the PlayStation five.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.840
That is up against the Xbox, Xbox in Japan. Come on.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.040
But that hasn't happened in 33 years.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.000
The last time that supposedly happened, November 1988,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.280
when the Famicom had the top 30 games.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.880
Now, keep in mind, Japan is not the US.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.360
So there are some differences.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.760
I think it's interesting that Minecraft is the top game in Japan right now.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760
I mean, I get it, but it's it's interesting.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.200
But other games in the list are things like Skyward Sword, Mario Kart eight,

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.080
Monster Hunter, Taiko no Tatsujin, Dragon Quest.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.200
Those are all the types of games you're seeing in the top 30 in Japan right now.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.640
Also, something that's been pointed out about Japan

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.280
is that they are really in the peak of the pandemic right now.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.040
Whereas, you know, I think a lot of I mean, you know,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.280
with Delta or whatever, some could argue we're in a peak of the pandemic.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.160
But I think here in the US, you saw like peak pandemic culture shifts

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.320
in like March, April, May, when it was first happening last year.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.960
And Japan's kind of going through that now.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.080
So some are saying that that's why the switch possibly is seeing a resurgence

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.360
because of, you know, it's it's portability and, you know, all of that.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.800
So I think it's interesting.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.080
Also, I kind of just think with the PlayStation five

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.520
being, you know, somewhat the newer system,

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.440
but there's not a ton of games on it right now. Yes, there's some.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.640
I can see where it's probably slipped out of the top 30 for the moment.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.640
You know, because there's just not a new triple A title

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.080
to really sell in Japan right now. So.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.000
Anyway, some comments in chat.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.120
Mike Deft says Taiko should be top 30 in US as well.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.720
Maybe someday. Maybe you got it.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.000
You got to just buy a lot more copies.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.040
Dartetsuya says, Oh, yeah, I hear Monster Hunter is huge over there.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.880
Dragon Quest, probably even more so. Yes, to both those things.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.040
Monster Quest and Dragon, Dragon, Dragon Hunter, Monster Quest, Dragon Hunter.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.400
Sure, whatever. Those games are huge in Japan.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.000
So. All right. Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.800
Whale. So

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.840
for fans of NetherRealm's fighting games,

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.280
of which there are many because let's face it, their fighting games are good.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.720
But they're giving the priority to Mortal Combat 12 over Injustice three.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.600
And it makes sense.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:31.800
You know, Mortal Combat is the bigger name, I reckon, when it comes to.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.480
To IPs. And it really would make sense to me that they would do that.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.040
They know that it's going to make money, first of all,

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.080
and they know that they don't need

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.560
to focus on DC characters

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:00.000
when they've got their own entire roster of characters

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.320
that they can make the money off of. Right.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.560
I find the whole thing to be an injustice, quite frankly,

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.200
because I like that fighting series. Really? Yes, really.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.600
I would like to see an Injustice three, but I get it.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.760
What is this all rooted in?

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.000
Was there a tweet or something?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.120
Because some folks in chat are lighting up like, why did they confirm it in a

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.640
yeah, there was a

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.440
a giant bomb video

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.480
that gives a lot of hints to

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.840
another round focusing more on Mortal Combat 12.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.840
And also, I don't know, it just seems likely anyway,

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.800
but I thought it was worth mentioning just because this also then might

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.760
give a little bit of credence to them working on the next games.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.120
Johnny Woofay in our chat over at twitch.tv

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.600
slash VOG Network has some things to say, including even if the story is true,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.360
you won't see a mainline Mortal Combat announced for at least four years.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.600
NRS or NetherRealm Studios is an active development of a new title right now,

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.240
whatever that may be.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.840
Going on to say 11 can be fun in small bursts,

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.480
but I got burned out really fast on it.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.600
And something new, it would be exciting, too.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.760
How about not a fighting game?

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.040
How about a game that's nothing but sassing each other in those intro scenes?

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.600
I mean, don't get me wrong, because honestly, that's why I care about it.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.680
Don't get me wrong.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.120
I love the fighting games that they produce,

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.920
but I think it might be really fun to see them do something else.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.720
It's kind of like we need.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.560
We need a spinoff that's called Text from Cassie Cage.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.720
Johnny Woofay says The Grid, too.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.400
Fuck, yeah. Why not?

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.880
Were you laughing or coughing or both?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.440
I was coughing.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.320
Yeah, so I'm interested to see whatever they come up with next.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.520
I also can understand that they probably would not want to bring out

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.520
a Mortal Combat 12, certainly not this year or next probably next year, even.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.920
But I don't know if I would say four years in my crystal ball.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.720
I would say maybe 2023 for Mortal Combat 12,

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.680
because that'll be about the time that PlayStation 5 and Xbox

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.280
Series X are not seen as like new anymore.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.160
They're going to be like the standard.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.960
And so I think Mortal Combat 12 is probably going to build to that standard.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.080
And certainly the graphics and all that stuff are going to push to that level.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.920
And I think the frames you get out of it are going to be very powerful.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.880
Here's here's the other problem coming out of it, too.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.440
And now just between the two games

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.360
and just as hadn't had a release since 2017, and I think it's due.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.120
But there's also the crap going on with AT&T

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.800
because AT&T owns WB Games that owns NetherRealm.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.680
And AT&T put up its games division last year,

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.360
like had bids from EA take to Microsoft Blizzard.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.320
There was no deal.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.920
But, you know, that's a lot of properties to go with it.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.120
So who knows if they're going to make another bid at it?

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.000
I don't know what we're going to see.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.600
Well, time will tell.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.920
So but until then, we get rumors and lines to read in between.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.080
And it isn't just a Fleetwood Mac album. That's right.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.480
All right. Moving on, Logie.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.600
Yeah, so we've kind of talked a little bit about Epic Store

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.760
adding some other like apps and stuff to the store.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.480
Remember, there was a whole thing with itch.io and that kind of thing.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.000
Well, now they're actually adding self-publishing.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.840
So you're going to be able to actually publish games onto the Epic Store

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.360
similar to how you can on the Steam platform.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.800
Of course, with that, they don't want any pornography or illegal content,

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.360
hateful discriminatory stuff.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.480
IP infringing things, you know, the normal type of thing.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.520
But right now it is in beta.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.200
I'm not sure what it's going to take to necessarily publish

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.600
something on the platform, but it is interesting to see them open that up,

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.400
especially when I think they were talking about how their platform

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.000
is going to be more curated over Steam.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.040
But now it's going to be the same.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.320
So the same yet with less features.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.760
Have you guys been using the Epic Store at all?

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.160
Like, I even forget to go in there and claim my free game anymore.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.480
I try to remember to claim my free games, but that's about it.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.200
I claimed Yooka-Laylee.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.760
Oh, I see. I think I missed that one.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.280
Damn it. I think it's still on.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.360
Is it? We have it on so many platforms.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.400
Like I have it on I have it on Steam. I have it on Twitch.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.000
Yeah, I think it's on Game Pass.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.920
Yeah. And Game Pass.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.760
Yeah, I mean, so it's like.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.280
I don't know. It's no big deal.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.560
I will say I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.760
but I was still using the Xbox cloud as a way to kind of like sample games

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.560
without downloading them.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.600
That's actually how I played Haven and just giving props to the Xbox cloud.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.760
Like I enjoy it, just being able to pick up all these different games

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.320
and just play them.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.480
And I imagine for Jamie, it's a very similar thing with Stadia

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.200
and the games that they include in their their bundle.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.400
Like I've been very skeptical of cloud gaming, but I

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.080
I'm starting to really see how that ease of really just bringing up a game

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.520
and jumping right into it is really nice, even if it isn't quite

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.360
the same graphical fidelity I would get if I'd install the game.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.120
But it's it's neat to see that technology kind of progressing.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.880
Again, I don't know how long I would use it.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.600
I certainly wouldn't play a game like FOM has 14 that I've spent

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.200
hours and hours and hours on that way.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:49.120
But to dip in a quick game for 30 minutes or an hour, it's

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.440
it's been kind of useful. So I'll give it that.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.120
All right. Moving on, let's talk about oh, let's talk about a game

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.000
I'd rather just not have to download and just play it through the cloud,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.600
to be honest, which I guess a lot of people did on Stadia

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.600
was Cyberpunk 2077, which just got a new patch.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.120
This is the biggest patch to date.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.200
They're saying it's the third major update since the original launch in December.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.600
Remember, remember Cyberpunk, everybody?

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.440
Remember that game came out and it was it was it had some problems.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.840
Special. Yeah. So 1.3 is the new version now.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.040
They're talking about streaming and memory management.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.040
And now they're going to deliver some more things in it.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.280
So free DLC like cosmetic, cosmetic,

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.240
cosmetic, excuse me, additions are included in this as well.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.960
There's also an alternative look for Johnny Silverhand, if you want that.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:45.520
And then lots and lots and lots of bug fixes, gameplay, UI,

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.920
quests, things of that nature, being able to reset

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.040
and reallocate perk points from the skill trees, all of that is available.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.800
Now, if you want to turn to other parts of the Internet and other people,

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.040
amateurs, if you will, but I don't even know if I would say they're amateurs

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.120
because a lot of these people do it very well.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.320
Professional modders at work putting their own spin on the game.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.960
And apparently there is a very well-known cyberpunk modder named Scissors

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.760
one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.880
I love that name. Just so we're clear.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.200
They released a gameplay rebalance mega mod.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.320
It's available on Nexus mods.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.520
And it you know, you check that out and it does a lot with the game.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:31.240
The the removal of scaling is a big part of it.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.360
So in the base game, V and the enemies gain stats as you level up.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.800
In this mod, they stop doing that,

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.600
which is the way people some people prefer to play games.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.040
I prefer it that way.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.280
I don't like when the enemies level up when you do,

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.000
because there's something very satisfying about overpowering them.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.720
But I guess that's a developer's artistic choice.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.400
But I think I would like to use this mod if I played the game.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.560
So that's that.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.560
Check that out if you are so inclined.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.760
Looking at some comments from chat.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.720
Sj100Matt says, I haven't touched Cyberpunk this year.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.680
Still have it, but waiting for the updates to fully pick it up again.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.360
Well, this might be the update to draw your attention,

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.280
because it sounds like they have fixed an awful lot, that's for sure.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.160
So all right.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.200
And 5th Dream in chat points out a modder literally released this patch

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.640
like a week before Project Red suddenly announced the official patch.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.320
Whoops.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.640
Anyway, let's go to our next segment,

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:34.680
because I need to talk about some things that patching wasn't an option back then.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.440
So you all know this segment.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.080
Here we go.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.160
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.480
where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.600
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.200
And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Soccer?

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.080
I picked Arkanoid.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.000
And I don't even know why I picked Arkanoid.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.280
I was just like, man, what's something old?

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:14.800
It's cool.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:22.480
Yeah, so Arkanoid came out in 1986 in July in Japan,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.720
US in August 1986, Europe just 1986 sometime.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.960
And it is a block breaker arcade game published by Taito.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.480
In the US, it was published by Romstar,

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.760
who is not related to Homestar or Homsar.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:47.200
So you play this paddle spacecraft called the VAUS.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:53.720
And you basically have to clear out the blocks by basically bouncing a ball around.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.640
It's like one person pong with ball with a well, I mean, there's balls.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.720
There's always balls with blocks.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.920
Some blocks are indestructible, some may require multiple hits,

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.560
but they are, it's kind of addictive and fun.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:17.960
The designers from Taito, Fujita Akira and Tsuji no Hiroshi,

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.960
were expanding the concept put out by Atari's Breakout, which is very similar.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.920
And it was a part of a contest inside of Taito

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.280
where two teams of designers would have to make a block breaker game

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.480
and see which one was superior to the other.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.880
They also got inspiration from Tron with the games

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.080
for the games neon-ish aesthetic.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.600
And so they designed the levels, they drew everything up.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.800
They did like different power ups and different goodies like that.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.760
And then they put out some play tests

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.480
and it was actually better than they expected it to be.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.280
It went on to become a major success.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:17.560
It became the highest grossing table arcade cabinet of 1987 in Japan.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.520
And then there has just been so much more out of it.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.840
So let's go ahead and dig in a little bit.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.760
So I told you how you play it.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.520
You get like different add-ons, you get different power ups,

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.280
different things that increase every new level,

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.800
the various variations, formations, flying enemy ships, you name it.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.800
You can even expand the vase, add more balls.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.480
Have a laser cannon or break directly into the next level, an extra vase.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.320
But the gameplay is always the same.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.000
The final stage was just 33 on most versions and 36 on the NES.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.200
You fight the boss called DoH.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.360
And once you reach that, you no longer have the option

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.640
to continue out of running out of lives, you play until you're dead.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.520
It's always game over.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.320
So apparently Tsuchino's,

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.360
I guess, game developer name was Onijist, O-N-I-J-I-S-T.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.240
They were part of Taito's Yokohama Research Institute,

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.600
and they basically participated in the contest and out it came.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.240
And Tsuchino was a big fan of Tron, so that's where a lot of that came in there.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.880
Basically, the geometric enemies

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.800
and their power ups were actually hand drawn from 3D models

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.480
and converted into sprite art.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.840
And then Okura Hisayoshi,

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.800
who is the founder of Taito's house band,

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.360
Izunata, did the game's music.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.120
Really short development cycle.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:13.320
It was described as murderous.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.880
There have been many conversions of various versions.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.360
We're talking about ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC,

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.560
Commodore 64, BBC Micro, MSX, Atari 8-bit, Apple II,

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.200
NES Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, IBM PC,

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.120
a Mac version in 1987,

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.960
a port for the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1989.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.600
All the computer ports were done by Imagine.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.240
The NES port came with a custom controller.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.040
And it really became one of Taito's most profitable games.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.800
It pulled money in hand over fist.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.920
It was compared in an issue of computer and video games in December 1986,

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.720
where it was compared to Pong and Space Invaders

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.880
in regards to simplicity and addictiveness,

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.960
that it was also simple, colorful, fun, fast and addictive.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.600
And it has won the Silver Award from Gamest,

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.760
Game of the Year from Compute Magazine, Best Arcade Translation.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.680
I mean, just all kinds of different things.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.880
As far as its legacy is concerned,

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.640
there were a number of direct and indirect sequels.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.760
One of them was Tournament Arkanoid in 1987.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.360
It came out in the U.S. by Romstar.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.080
It was actually developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan,

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.000
but it added new levels.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.960
There was Revenge of Dou, which is a true sequel with new gameplay mechanics.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.320
Came out in arcades in 1987.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.560
Arkanoid Dou It Again and Arkanoid Returns in 1997,

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.120
followed by Arkanoid DS in 2007.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.880
Arkanoid Live was published on May 6, 2009 for Xbox Live Arcade.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:22.040
WiiWare got Arkanoid Plus and there is Arkanoid for iOS,

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.080
which I have it on my phone. I love it.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.160
It's one of my time sinks.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.760
There is also a mashup called Arkanoid versus Space Invaders,

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.320
and it came out in 2017 for iOS and Android.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.480
And that's it. Our game is Arkanoid.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.280
One that I have a lot of memories of, too.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.840
That special controller on the NES that I never had.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.120
But it looked like a lot of fun.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.880
Yeah, I like the one I'm watching right now is like the laser weapon

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.160
because it was over if I got the laser weapon.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.120
Yeah, that's that's very much.

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120
Sorry, it's probably causing those listening on podcast

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.240
like what is that pew pew pew noise I keep hearing?

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.600
That's because they picked up the laser weapon in the game

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.320
and they're just using that to really clear the board.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.600
This person is actually pretty good.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.040
Yeah, they're they're doing that.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.320
It's I bet it's Tass.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.160
It might be. I don't know. Yeah.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.600
So hey, not bad. Yeah. Well, there it is.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.840
Oh, man, they got the catch weapon now.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.240
I freaking love the catch weapon.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.360
I played a lot of that on the NES.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.840
I keep forgetting just how long that game has really lived on.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.160
I forgot about the Arkanoid versus Space Invaders thing.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.880
I wanted to play that. It looked interesting.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.800
So I just never got around to it.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.560
All right. Let's one day one day sequel.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.480
Let's do some rapid fire news.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.320
Let's talk about some other headlines, but quickly, Loki.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.680
It's happened.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.760
I know this is going to come as a shock, but.

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.720
Skyrim is coming out.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.040
Again, that's right.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.640
The thesis announced that Skyrim, the anniversary edition.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.160
See, they can do this every single year now.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.000
Is coming out.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.440
It's basically the remastered edition that they had before.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.600
But now they're also including 500 Creator Club mods

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:18.160
and some other things, as well as support for next gen consoles.

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.040
That is going to be coming out November 11th.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.080
This year, I don't even know what else they could do for newer consoles,

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.760
like I got to say, I played it'll look prettier.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.760
It already looks pretty fucking good on series X, like just because they

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.480
enhanced it already for the one X when they released that.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.480
And it looks really good.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.160
So they're going to enhance it again.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:40.760
All right.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.080
The Creator Club content that they're putting a value on was all of.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.160
I don't know if it now they had.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.560
So these were the they're not mods there,

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.840
but were I don't remember what they're calling them. Not mods.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.080
No, we're not charging for mods.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.280
That's that's ridiculous. It's micro DLC.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.720
So these are like little things that they put together.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.040
But also, I can't think that all 500 of those are necessarily Bethesda's

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.040
micro DLCs or whatever they call them.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.920
A lot of it is user made content as well that were actually mods.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.480
There's probably something in the fine print that it's like if you put it here,

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.240
we can get it in a compilation someday and they're fucking all those people over.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.800
I'm sure that's got to be part of it.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.320
Absolutely. Please enjoy your free copy of the game.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.800
You've already bought four times.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.240
Yeah. Yeah. Just like was it Warcraft remastered?

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.720
Yeah. All the mods you make are ours.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.120
Signed exhibition.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.160
This is why. I'll probably play it, though.

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.680
I'll still play it.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.960
I'm part of the problem and how.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.800
So there's that.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.680
And then speaking of older games coming back, as Robin mentioned,

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:11.640
you know, Quake has been remastered and it's out now on all sorts of platforms.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:12.960
And it looks awesome.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.240
And it's got four K.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:18.720
It is awesome support in 120 FPS and all sorts of cool things.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.960
Plus mods. You don't have to pay for it.

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.240
It plays fucking great on the series X,

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.920
except for the fact that you're with a controller, which now look,

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.760
I enjoy controller controllers a lot in some games, but like a shooter like Quake,

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.040
you really have to have keyboard mouse for, in my opinion.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.080
So, yeah, I wish you could hook up a keyboard mouse to the light.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.840
Well, I think you can hook one up, but I don't think a lot of games support it.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.120
But maybe this one does.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.760
But as I alluded to earlier in the show,

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.480
if you got that free quake that they gave away during the last Quake Con,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.360
they upgraded it to this version free.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.480
And so I did play a little bit of it on my PC.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.600
And I don't get to play a lot of 4K games on my PC because it's not like

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.360
my graphics card can't quite handle it that well.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.840
And good luck trying to get a graphics card these days.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.320
So I just kind of stuck with what I have and

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.880
but on what I have, it runs.

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.520
Thankfully, Quake is an old ass game, so it runs smooth in 4K on my system.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.920
I like it a lot. Very pretty.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.000
So, D'Artesuya in chat says, I was shocked to learn about the free upgrade.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.480
I heard Modern Vintage Gamer was the one that wrote the new Quake,

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:29.360
so I wonder if the Xbox One has keyboard mouse support.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.360
That would be lovely.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.800
But I haven't looked into it, to be quite honest.

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.800
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.160
Well, we have something that makes me happy.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.880
Cat Lateral Damage Remiowstered is going to launch on

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:54.360
September 15th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.560
It better be on Mac as well, or else I will riot.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.120
But anyway, you can collect treats.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:11.000
You get the collect real cat photos and litter box mode, all that's there.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.440
Different progression redesign.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.440
But you find the cat treats as rewards for procedural mode.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:25.440
And the PlayStation 5 version has some special features that use the capabilities of the console,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:29.440
with 4K resolution, faster load times, increased render distance,

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.440
and support for activities and game presets.

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.440
And, of course, DualSense haptics.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440
So, yay.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:46.880
And then the other is, absolutely, the moment that I saw it, I was at a loss.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.880
Sonny Chiba died due to COVID complications.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.880
And I had missed this news.

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.320
And I was absolutely floored.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.320
I mean, I grew up watching, you know, a lot of Sonny Chiba movies.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:12.320
And, you know, I just was, you know, he always played the tough guy or the bad guy

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.320
and the one who would just hit everyone, like, extra hard.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.320
Like, I know there was one movie where he, like, punched,

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.320
like, his character punched him in the face.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:29.760
That it sort of invented the x-ray view of the skull breaking that Mortal Kombat bit off of.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:40.760
But, I mean, his stage name in Japan was Chiba Shinichi.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.760
He was born Maeda Asada-ho.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.760
And he studied under the same name as Chiba Shinichi.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:57.200
And he studied under one of the great karate masters.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.200
And he was a master himself.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.200
He could do anything.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:09.200
His nickname was, I mean, he actually didn't get to show any of his skills until 1973

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200
where he was in the film Karate Kiba.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.200
Of course, he was in Kill Bill.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.200
He was in the...

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.200
This whole crowd knows him from Kill Bill.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.640
The early years of OLR were heavily influenced by that movie.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.640
We were quoting it left and right.

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.640
We had parody commercials based on that movie.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.640
So, you know, we all saw that movie multiple times.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.640
There's more.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.640
But he did influence Tarantino films, especially with the 1993 film True Romance.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:50.080
He also was in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift playing a Yakuza boss.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:59.080
But he was doing a lot more in Japan.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:05.080
And he actually had another movie in the works.

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:10.520
I mean, he basically...

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.520
His movies were the blueprints for a lot of our current hyper-violent martial arts movies.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:25.520
One of his roles where he played Tsurugi Takuma, he ripped throats out with his bare hands.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:33.520
And he could kill adversaries with a pencil.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.960
I'm actually just reading through some of these other examples.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:38.960
And I remember watching a lot of this, because like I said,

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.960
I watched a lot of the Sonny Chiba movies when I was a kid.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.960
So, yeah.

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.960
It's a loss.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.960
And shoot, at 82, still a pretty good-looking man.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.960
Well, fuck COVID, that's for sure.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.960
I actually didn't realize it was because of COVID complications.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.960
And fuck anti-vaxxers.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.400
And pod culture and chat says, get the fucking shot.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.400
But I imagine it's not like we here in the States are in that situation

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.400
where it is very easy to get the shot at this point.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.400
We couldn't have said this six months ago, but now it is very easy to get the shot.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:17.400
You just go get it.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.400
That I don't think is the case in every country right now.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.400
I think we are unique in that circumstance.

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:29.400
In every state, even Alabama is being...

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.840
Alabama is defying national orders right now,

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.840
and they're not distributing the vaccines the way that they're supposed to.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.840
It's absolutely ridiculous.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840
And pod culture and chat says, I was speaking to people in general.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.840
Yeah, I get it.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.840
That wasn't a drag you or a call out type of thing.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.840
I'm just kind of reminding ourselves that not everywhere in the world

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.840
can get vaccinated right now.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.840
So that is even more so why we should be doing it.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.840
But the good news is, I heard they're giving the Pfizer shot at least,

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.280
the official OK on Monday, whatever it had to meet to get that official

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.280
will happen on Monday, it sounds like.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.280
And from there, now they can enforce a mandate on the vaccine and all that stuff.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.280
I'm sure Moderna won't be that far behind or J&J.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.280
It's just those vaccines came out a little bit later.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.280
So I think they have to be out on the market for so long.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.280
So yeah, get your vaccine.

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.280
All right.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:30.720
And the real scary part is now you're hearing about people like Reverend Jesse Jackson

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.720
and his wife were vaccinated and now they're still in the hospital.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.720
Unfortunately, that can happen.

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720
They're older.

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720
They're in their 80s, if I'm not mistaken.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.720
So it stinks.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.720
But yeah, it's just even more so like if only the people around them would have been vaccinated.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.720
But when you're a people person like the Reverend Jesse Jackson, you probably come in contact with a lot of unvaccinated folks.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.720
So it's unfortunate.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.160
All right.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.160
Let's move on.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.160
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things to play while you're at home isolating.

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.160
Starting in the U.S., Loki.

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160
Yes.

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:15.160
So this week we have Aliens Fireteam Elite on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:21.160
We have King's Bounty 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:26.160

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:33.160
Murder Mystery Machine on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:40.160
Psychonauts 2 on PC, Mac and Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:50.160
Hotel Life Resort Simulator on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:52.160
The Legend of Heroes.

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.160
Hajimari no Kizuki that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.160
We've got Spelunky and Spelunky 2 coming on Nintendo Switch as well.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.160
Baldo on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.160
No More Heroes 3 on Nintendo Switch.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:19.160
And we've got Tormented Souls on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160
That's it.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.160
All right. Well going over to Japan, we have a slightly bigger week now on the Switch.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.160
We've had some slow weeks, but there's quite a few games out this week on Japan.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.160
On the Nintendo Switch, King's Bounty 2 is out on the 24th.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.160
And then when you go ahead to the 26th, you get even more.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.160
Sukihime, A Piece of Blue Glass Moon in regular and limited edition.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:43.160
Kamisama no Yuunakimi-e comes out as well in a regular and limited edition.

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:49.160
There's also a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Volume 1 from SNK that's out in Japan.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.160
Yeah, I thought that might get your attention.

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.160
Oh, I heard about that, yeah.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.160
Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.

01:42:54.160 --> 01:43:02.160
Let's see, it's SNK Gal Fighters, Samurai Shodown 2, King of Fighters R2, The Last Blade Beyond the Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact,

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.160
SNK vs. Capcom, Metal Slug First and Second Mission, Dark Arms and Big Tournament Golf.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.160
And they actually put like a pocket station type of thing on your phone.

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:15.160
Or sorry, not on your phone, on your Switch so you can kind of see.

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.160
And there's like different ones that you can put on there.

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.160
So this seems like something you might want to import Dark Sakura if they're not doing a release here locally.

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.160
Which I don't know if they would.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.160
So anyway, that definitely has your name all over it.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.160
Yeah, it does.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.160
Even I cuddle with that.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.160
Let's see, we also have The Legend of Heroes.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.160
Hajimari no Kiseki comes out on the 26th as well.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:42.160
And we finally get a release of Destroy All Humans.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:46.160
And Alex Kidd in Miracle World Deluxe are also out this week.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.160
Even though those are in English, they are still at least releasing.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.160
On the Playstation 5, Hitman 3 is out of Japan.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.160
That is an English version.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.160
Along with that, Alex Kidd in Miracle World is out there as well.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.160
And Override 2, Super Mech League, Ultraman Deluxe Edition.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.160
Because of course, Ultraman.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Also out this week in Japan, Playstation 5.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.160
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:15.160
We have on the 24th Aliens Fireteam Elite.

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.160
King's Bounty 2 as well.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:24.160
Also on the 24th is Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:31.160
On the 27th we have Absalom End of Gods.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.160
American Fugitive.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.160
Tormented Souls.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.160
And that's it for this week.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160
Alright.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160
Just a few more stories for you guys.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.160
Then we're going to get to the listener round table.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.160
I mean just a few.

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160
I think we usually take about 5 or 6 stories.

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160
But we only have 3 left.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160
It was a little bit of a slower news week, quite honestly.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160
I mean there were some big headlines we've already kind of touched on.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.160
But overall, I feel like we're in a little bit of a lull right now in gaming.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.160
And I don't know if that's the pandemic.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160
Is that the time of year coming up on Labor Day?

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.160
Or what?

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.160
Or all of the above, which is probably the real answer.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.160
So anyway, a few more stories for you guys.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.160
And we'll start it off with Loki.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:16.160
Yeah, so we have another story regarding the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.160
No, we're not talking about Activision this time.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.160
We're talking about Riot Games.

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:26.160
So Riot Games had basically run afoul of DFEH's.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:37.160
They had investigated them and apparently found that they were trying to bar individuals from filing complaints.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.160
Or assisting in DFEH cases.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:48.160
And basically also referring to the anti-retaliation, anti-interference provisions.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:56.160
And based on this, they're still kind of causing issues and dragging their heels.

01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:07.160
I believe what this stems from, if I remember correctly, is that they were supposed to, after investigating some of the discrimination and harassment and stuff that was going on in the company.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:22.160
They were supposed to have been ordered to put out a communication to the employees regarding their rights as employees and how they can reach out if they've experienced any harassment and stuff like that.

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.160
But apparently they have not done that yet.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:39.160
So the court ordered notice was to inform workers that they may freely cooperate, participate, and obtain potential relief if awarded in the DFEH's pending action.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:51.160
And that Riot Games cannot retaliate or take any adverse action against them for speaking to them or participating in any pending action or obtaining potential relief in such actions.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.160
So they haven't done that yet.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:47:00.160
And this, I think, investigation began back in 2018, and they're still dragging their feet on it.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.160
Hmm.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:06.160
Kinsurian, that's just like a communication that they need to send out.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.160
What's the holdup here, Riot Games?

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.160
You might want to click that send email button.

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.160
Yeah, you're just asking for trouble now.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.160
Yeah, this is not a good look.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:19.160
And yeah, like S2100matt in chat says, why delay it if you have nothing to hide, Riot?

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:30.160
Exactly. Yeah, so basically a court ordered Riot Games to produce, I guess, they were supposed to have put up this communication.

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:38.160
And they ordered Riot to produce, I guess, them back in January 2021.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:43.160
However, they delayed production until April 2021.

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:57.160
And then apparently, the settlement separation agreements or whatever that they were providing had some language in it that, you know, DFEH was not happy with.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.160
And so they were supposed to be correcting that, and they haven't done that yet.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.160
So, hmm.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.160
Guys, can't mess around with this stuff.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:19.160
Well, you know, it's like we were talking about with the Activision Blizzard issues a couple of weeks ago that, reminder, are actually still ongoing because, and I already said this once, but I'll say it again, the Blizzard employee requests have gone unresponded to.

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:28.160
But when that was all first being talked about, we mentioned several times, you know, Blizzard and Activision are kind of the companies that the spotlight is shining on at the moment.

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:30.160
But this is an industry problem.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:37.160
And, you know, on one hand, I'm kind of with Questbuster where it's like, oh, look, Riot Games is in trouble again. Surprised Pikachu phase.

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:48.160
So, unfortunately, and I hate to sound so, hmm, la-di-da, about this, because it's serious allegations, but it's also one of those things where it's like, it's not the first time we've heard this out of Riot.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.160
So I don't think anybody's particularly surprised to hear this. It's extremely disappointing.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:49:00.160
But on the other hand, it just goes to show this shittiness is in way too many places that are way too high up in the gaming industry, and it has to end, period.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:10.160
But I'm at least happy to see that our government and the courts are doing what they need to do. It's taken a long time to get here.

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.160
But this is, again, one of those cases where when the companies can't fix themselves, I guess the government will have to do it.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:20.160
So you might want to click that send email button because it sounds like you have people's attentions.

01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:30.160
So, anyway, really quickly before I get into my next story, earlier I had mentioned I wonder what it is that's causing the slower Newsweek.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:38.160
A couple people have some explanations there. Mike Def says, next week is going to be filled with news, though, I think. I would agree.

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:45.160
Bobby Blackwell says they're all prepping for PAX and Gamescom. Gamescom, yes, but who's going to PAX?

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:54.160
I'm not reading because obviously Bobby and I are going to Dragon Con. It's all the same at this point as it is going to PAX.

01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:00.160
But I mean what companies are going to PAX at this point? I haven't heard of a lot of exhibitors there.

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:05.160
They're just now announcing the music guest. Okay, Bobby says he's joking about PAX.

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:12.160
But I'm not. What companies are going to PAX? What's going to happen there at this point?

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:21.160
So it's very interesting. All right. Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says a lot of exhibitors pulled out.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:28.160
Well, if nothing else, y'all, I'm getting a nice week vacation in Atlanta coming up, getting the hell out of town.

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:37.160
It'll be nice. All right. Perhaps this will be a little more exciting, and that is EVO in 2022.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.160
EVO is going to be returning to Las Vegas. It was announced this week in 2022.

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:49.160
EVO 2021, of course, was held online, but that was better than no EVO at all, which is what happened in 2020.

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:58.160
So they did EVO 2021 online, and at the conclusion of it, they announced that EVO will be back in Las Vegas August 5th through 7th, 2022.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.160
Except they haven't said where yet, although most people are assuming it'll be at the Mandalay Bay Event Center, as it always has been.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:10.160
But I mean, again, a lot could have changed in the past couple of years.

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:17.160
So, yeah, EVO 2022, it's also noted, will be the first in-person tournament since Sony bought them. Remember that?

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:22.160
Sony owns EVO now. So it'll be interesting to see what that looks like when it's in person.

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:28.160
You got to wonder if maybe some of those like PlayStation Experience, was that when it was PSX, the PlayStation Experience?

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:34.160
If some of those elements will come back to like, you know, an in-person type of event.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.160
But we have literally a year until we find out what that really looks like.

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.160
But they have announced that they are going to be aiming for that in person, which, of course, they are.

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:49.160
I think we're all hopeful that this will be on its way out, and certainly in a year's time.

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:55.160
Oh, who is this that just sat down? That's not the same person that was there before. Hold on.

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160
My shirt matches yours.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.160
Oh, you changed your shirt. I love it.

01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.160
Yeah, I changed my shirt.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.160
And you changed your wig for the podcast listeners.

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160
And my lipstick.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160
Also like me.

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:12.160
Honestly, this wig is a lot more comfortable, and I was starting to get a headache, so I switched out my wig.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.160
Or as Stark Tetsuya says in chat, new wig, who dis?

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.160
Yeah, I do post that pretty often.

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:25.160
All right, well, Dark Sakura, you also tell us stories pretty often here on the show, and we got our last story tonight from you.

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:32.160
Yeah, so, well, it's dead, but not really.

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.160
So Toys R Us is back in the news.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:40.160
Rise from your grave.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.160
We have risen from the grave, yeah.

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:49.160
So now there's a partnership with Macy's.

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:58.160
There's an organization that's also called True Kids Brand that bought the rights to Toys R Us.

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:07.160
And then they partnered with a retailer called Beta, B-8-T-A, for small mall stores.

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:12.160
But it kind of shows a little bit.

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.160
There was one in Houston and one in Paramus.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:18.160
And then it closed.

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:33.160
And actually, there were a bunch of sensors that would check the move and flow of people through to collect data and to see which display shoppers were most attracted to.

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:40.160
But they didn't clarify exactly how it was being created, how long it was being stored for, so a big data problem.

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:47.160
So after all of this, both locations closed, especially due to COVID-19.

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:53.160
And now, True Kids has been acquired by WHP Global.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:54:05.160
And now they've done a partnership with Macy's to use their online presence to sell toys under the Toys R Us branding.

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:14.160
There is a site, it's not live yet, but Macy's dot com slash Toys R Us, all one word with no dashes.

01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:27.160
And then on top of that, they're going to be doing shop and shops inside, kind of like when you go to, what is it, JCPenney and there's like a Sephora in there.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:31.160
They're doing Toys R Us's like that inside of Macy's.

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:42.160
And they're hoping to increase their holiday sales, because the last time they did something like this was in 2018 when they had an agreement with FAO Schwartz.

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:48.160
Which, by the way, FAO Schwartz has stuff at Target now. That blew my mind. I just saw that this week.

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:54.160
I was at Target and they had like the keyboard from Big, we all remember that, right, that movie.

01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.160
And there was other stuff like a magic set and things I guess FAO Schwartz was known for.

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:02.160
They were selling it at Target and I was like, oh, that's where that ended up.

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.160
I wonder where KB Toys is going to end up at the 99 cent store.

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:10.160
Mm hmm. Who knows?

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:16.160
All right. Johnny Woofay in chat says they turned our Toys R Us into a storage facility. Ah, sad face.

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:23.160
I haven't seen what the buildings around here changed into. If anything, they're probably, they're probably haunted.

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:29.160
Oh, Hobby Lobby. Gross. All right. Is that what the old birdcage one is?

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:37.160
Yes, it's a Hobby Lobby, which doesn't make any sense because like literally like right behind it is a Michaels. Why?

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:39.160
Anyway.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.160
Hobby Lobby is the devil anyway.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:46.160
As 200 Matt says, Dollar General. Yeah, just just what we need more of, dollar stores.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.160
And actually Dollar General Rob predates Dollar Tree.

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.160
Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah, they're they're different.

01:55:54.160 --> 01:56:00.160
Dejirama S points out the Toys R Us by me as a spirit Halloween. Oh, don't get me started on spirit Halloween.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:08.160
I mean, I love the store, but it's we all know the meme of building has become a spirit store.

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.160
You know, it's silly. Bobby Blackwell says ours is a Burlington.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.160
Ours is a Burlington coat factory. Oh, now that that's a store I like.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:24.160
I like coats. Yeah, I like coats. I guess I've gotten some great coats at Burlington Coat Factory, so can't complain too much.

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:28.160
All right. Anyway, we're going to get into the listener roundtable.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.160
If you would like to give us a call, join our discord, vog network dot com slash discord and hit up the green room channel.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.160
And we'll take some calls if anybody wants to call.

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:42.160
We also use this opportunity to check in with our mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:47.160
It's the place to send an email. I'm not sure we got any this week, but I'll look to dark soccer to confirm.

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.160
OK, there it is. We got Jack and shit.

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:56.160
Well, then you can also tell us in chat if there's something you'd like for us to talk about or what have you.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:00.160
But now everybody's talking about spirit Halloween.

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:07.160
As 200 Matt says, the dead mall by me turned the now gone Saks Fifth Avenue into spirit Halloween.

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:12.160
Wow. Wow. When a Saks turns into one, what a crazy shit.

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.160
Well, I mean, I love spirit, but let's be real. It's a downgrade.

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:22.160
Interesting. Bobby Blackwell says it was originally going to be a hobby lobby, but that fell through.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:28.160
So it's now a Burlington. Oh, interesting. Hobby Lobby is evil.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:33.160
Tiger Cost says, you know, another store that's gone Sears, you know, another store that's gone.

01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:41.160
Montgomery Ward. Sears last year was a spirit Halloween store.

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:47.160
What was it? Oh, wow. Yeah, it was. But now that whole side of the whole mall is dead pretty much.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:52.160
I mean, like I was driving by it the other day and looking at it, it's just like there's no one there.

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:57.160
I think I went inside there and like half the mall is closed off. It's just it's.

01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:05.160
Yeah, yikes. Because I think those those theaters are gone now.

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:10.160
Oh, man. The discount theaters. Yeah. Lord knows what you're stepping in on the floor.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:16.160
The sign outside. Oh, God. Yeah. They saw the sign outside. But yeah, it's gone.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.160
They should. Somebody should just write in the marquee jokes like coming soon. Spirit Halloween store.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:27.160
People should do that. I don't understand. Anyway, we do have somebody waiting in the green room to come on the show,

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:31.160
so we'll get to it and bring them in, invite them to talk to us.

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:37.160
Hi there. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Pixel Pacas. Hey, Pixel Pacas.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:41.160
It is great to have you on the show. How are you doing? I'm doing well.

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:45.160
Thanks. Loving the show as always. Well, thank you so much. Loving having you here.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:50.160
What's on your mind? So I just wanted to bring up some news that it's kind of a big deal to me.

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:57.160
And some other folks might be interested as well. Sure. So in Banning, California, it's kind of just out there.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:04.160
Yeah. I know about this. Yeah. The Museum of Pinball is closing.

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:11.160
Which is sad. I only got to go there once, though. Tons of pinball machines, also arcade machines.

01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:19.160
But the owners, they announced they're closing it like maybe this month. Is that the one in the Bay Area or the one in the desert?

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:24.160
No, no. I thought it was the one in Alameda, Rob, when I told you. That one also closed.

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:29.160
Well, they're not permanently closed. That's the Pacific Pinball Museum, I think.

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:34.160
OK, so Banning's the one because I think there was a convention there. I was looking at it, looking into going.

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:40.160
And it's down in, like, Palm Springs. OK, so it is kind of the desert.

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:44.160
OK, sorry. Just had to get my geography straightened out. Sorry.

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:51.160
Yeah, it's huge. It was like 40,000 square feet or something. Yeah, it's a big place.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:57.160
I regret never getting to go. There ain't a lot of there ain't a lot of shit to do in the desert.

01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:04.160
I mean, again, you had to explain to me very, very thoroughly where Banning, California was in the first place.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:11.160
Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing there except kind of an airport and a casino. But anyway, so they're closing.

02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:16.160
I got to go once. It was really cool. I'm sad that they're closing, but I mean, they couldn't do anything during COVID.

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:22.160
Right. So I think that probably plays into it. They couldn't open. They couldn't do anything for over a year.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:28.160
But now they're going to be auctioning off everything. Oh, over 1000 machines.

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:35.160
The auction's already open. Yeah, it's it's gonna be live, like starting September 10th.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:43.160
But you can register now. You can look. You can preview everything now. You can bid in person or online.

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.160
I'm laughing because Alan's in the other room. And I started looking at it.

02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.160
He can hear it because he hears the playback here in the studio. So he's he's in the other room.

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:59.160
I'm looking right at him going, baby Pac-Man, baby Pac-Man. I'm mouthing it. And he's like, no, we don't have the space.

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:05.160
No. But Rob, what? Baby Pac-Man, you can keep it at my house.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:11.160
Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan. Rob can keep it at my house. Baby Pac-Man.

02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:19.160
There you go. Oh, he said fine. He relented. OK, yeah. And it'll get to live at my house.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.160
Now, we actually just switched out. We traded a temporary trade.

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:30.160
We have the Rick and Morty table right now. We traded our Metallica temporarily.

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:35.160
Nice. Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in to hear me scream baby Pac-Man in your face.

02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:39.160
Is there is there a machine that you're looking at getting in throughout all this or what do you think?

02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:44.160
I'm just looking at this point. You know, I would like a pinball machine. I don't have any at this point,

02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:52.160
but I would like to kind of get started in that world of take of arcade and pinball machines taking over my life.

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.160
I'm ready. And your house? Yes, I'm ready.

02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:01.160
Dark Soccer, you should be giving away a free toaster that'll run Doom.

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.160
Do you watch Jack Danger? I do.

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.160
Cool. And actually talk to him. Message him sometime because he's really good with advice.

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:16.160
Nice. Yeah. Sure. And there's a pin side. Good for him there.

02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:22.160
But there's also I think it's like road you pin is another group, I think.

02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:28.160
OK, I haven't heard of that one. I'll see if I can find it. But I think they're by Papa.

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.160
The like Pacific arcade pinball something. So Bobby Blackwell is asking in chat,

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:39.160
do they ship? Because I think he has a particular machine in mind. That's the thing.

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.160
I think I'm pretty sure. Oh, I could have sent the link to you. I think you have to manage that yourself.

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.160
They have some recommended shipping partners or whatever, but it's really up to you.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:52.160
I think they'll give you a pallet, but you've got to figure out how you're going to take that. Get that to you.

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:57.160
Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, I think a pinball is not cheap.

02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:02.160
It is. Yeah. Who wants to rent a U-Haul and go down to Palm Springs with me?

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:06.160
Dark Soccer, Loki. I'll do it. All right.

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:10.160
Rob, you know, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm supposed to be saving money.

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.160
You know what? You know, you have the insider info. I was saving money.

02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:18.160
I know why. And Rob, what? What am I? But an enabler.

02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.160
You should do it. You should do it. I'm really fun.

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:27.160
Rob, YOLO, YOLO. And then and then and then and then and then.

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.160
No, we could do we could do. Hey, Alan, Alan, YOLO.

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:36.160
I didn't realize that Street Fighter two pinball machine. That's pretty cool.

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:40.160
Yeah, it's not very good. It's a got live one, I think. Do they have that?

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.160
OK, so like in when Bobby was talking about Southern Fried Game Rex,

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:48.160
Southern Fried Game Room Expo on a show tonight, he was showing footage from the event.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:54.160
And they actually had the big boy Mario Brothers pinball table, which you see far less

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:58.160
frequently than the little the more smaller one that was more for kids.

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.160
And that is that is what I almost feel like Bobby might want that slightly more than Dr.

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.160
No, probably not, because Mrs. Black Wolf is going to want the doctor who table.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.160
So. But yeah, I think that that's up there on the list, too.

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:17.160
And I honestly I love that Mario Brothers table, too, because they have a circus full tear.

02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:22.160
I might want to bid on that. Hmm. Hmm. They had a circus full tear.

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:30.160
All right. Well, I need to look and see if I actually I would love to have an Arabian Nights.

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:33.160
Because it's a Papa Duke. Do they have a baby? I haven't. I'm trying to do a show.

02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:38.160
I can't look at the catalog. Do they have a baby? It doesn't have like a search thing on here either.

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:44.160
All right. There. Oh, no. Yeah, there's actually if you go in advance search, there's like a keyword search.

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:49.160
They might be able to do that. There's only 742 lot items. It's fine.

02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:55.160
They're still adding more, though. Oh, OK. And Bobby Black Wolf says there is not a baby Pac-Man.

02:04:55.160 --> 02:05:04.160
There is? No. Oh, damn. Well, I think there's also two lots, though, because it's two auctions.

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:08.160
I'm sure everybody's doing cartwheels hearing there isn't one after all.

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:13.160
That's all right. Bobby Black will just point out Lot 503 is Circus Voltaire.

02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:20.160
So, yeah, it's probably not going to happen. We've got to do adult stuff.

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:29.160
What happened to enabling? Oh, yeah, but you don't have you don't have a Dan.

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:35.160
I can enable you. One ninety nine is a Max 2 machine. Really?

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:40.160
See, I really don't have the space for like an entire DDR machine. You on the other hand, Loki.

02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:47.160
I don't think of that much space. We actually don't because of all the pinball and the Mustang in the garage.

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:53.160
And I mean, get this. We've got a Mustang. Come on. Drop.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:57.160
This is Dan's first car. This is baby.

02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.160
I know. I know it's a pain. And you know what? You know what the deal with that is, right?

02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:08.160
Is that when Dan dies, I have to stuff his corpse into it, push it off a cliff and explode it midair.

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:13.160
I really don't know how to respond to that.

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:22.160
Little does he know I'm going to do like a paper craft Mustang and use that and then keep the real thing and put air conditioning in that sucker.

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:30.160
See, you need to be more specific. All right, Marcus, thank you for calling into the show and alerting us to the pinball sale,

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:36.160
which led to conversations about Dan's funeral, which are entirely premature.

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:40.160
But hey, that's the way things go here on Orange Launch Radio sometimes.

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.160
So, hey, anything else you want to shout out or get on out before we let you go?

02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:49.160
No, I just wanted to share that because I figured it'd be of interest.

02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:54.160
I still haven't figured out if I'm actually going, but if I am, you know, maybe I'll see if I can do anything to help you guys out.

02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:00.160
Well, Marcus, you figured correctly. Thank you for being in the neighborhood tonight on Orange Launch Radio.

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:05.160
All right. Bye, my friend. Bye.

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:10.160
I hope he didn't mind that I called him by his display name on Discord out of reflex and not PixelPakas.

02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.160
Oops. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go to our next call.

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.160
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:20.160
It's the one and only DJ Ron Maness. How is everybody tonight?

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:23.160
Rama, so good to see you. Literally see you.

02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:26.160
Oh, it's you.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.160
I have to represent the old rules.

02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.160
I missed you, Ron Chan.

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:34.160
Wait, there's a pinball machine called Gay Nineties.

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:38.160
Yes, there is a bar called the Gay Nineties in Minneapolis.

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:45.160
So usually when you hear the term gay nineties is referring to the eighteen nineties, which was like, yeah, it's referring to that.

02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:51.160
It looks it. Yeah, it just looked weird. Like I was trying to figure out what the theme was supposed to be because they've got like, you know.

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:54.160
No, it's not. It's not referring to queerest folk on Showtime.

02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:59.160
It's not referring to Will and Grace. What else was gay nineties? It's not referring to Frasier.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:02.160
Let's be real. Everybody on that show is gay. It's not.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.160
And I'm the cheerleader.

02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.160
And I'm on comedy show. All right.

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.160
But you did not call in to talk about the gay nineties, Rama, Loki.

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:13.160
What did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:16.160
But I'm always here to listen to your amazing gay stories, Rob. You know that.

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:20.160
Well, thank you. Thank you. Ah, fair.

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:23.160
OK, a couple of quick stories. I'll be on my merry little way.

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:29.160
All right. So for the last few weeks, I've been playing this game called The Ascent, and it's a great cyberpunk ish game.

02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:33.160
And, you know, you know, when you get into a game, you're really into the controller.

02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.160
Then you're wondering, why is the controller not working the way it should?

02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:40.160
So the trigger button started to stick on my Xbox.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:46.160
So I get the WD-40 sprayed in there and it should be fine.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:56.160
A couple of weeks later, start sticking again, and then I spray more WD-40 in the controller at two thirty in the morning when the only light that I have is off the TV.

02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:01.160
Did not realize I shot so much WD-40 into it that the entire controller was just lagging like crazy.

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.160
So you made it extra slippery.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:06.160
Yup.

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.160
So I'm like, I'll just order another Xbox one control off Amazon.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.160
How hard can that be? Famous words.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:19.160
I didn't expect to find them going as high as 80 to 100 dollars.

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:20.160
They're not.

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:23.160
Well, I didn't know there was a shortage going on or something.

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:25.160
The one or the Series X?

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.160
No, the Xbox one controller.

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:33.160
And I thought, well, Microsoft so long are making them, so they're making the series controller.

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:36.160
And I'm like, I'd rather have an Xbox one controller.

02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:41.160
So if I happen to sell my Xbox one, I won't lose any value on it.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:43.160
So I track one down.

02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.160
I get I find a remanufactured one for sixty five dollars.

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:50.160
Perfect. A few days later, the mail shows up.

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:56.160
I grab the package. I open it up.

02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.160
They send me an Xbox series controller instead.

02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.160
What?

02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:06.160
I'm just sitting here laughing like Kiyo Kusanagi from King of Fighters.

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.160
I'm like, are you serious right now?

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:10.160
But the series controller is really good.

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:15.160
I would imagine you would have gone full on Orochi if we were going to use that analogy.

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.160
I mean, to be perfectly honest, I'm just like, does it work?

02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:20.160
Yeah, it works.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.160
It's a controller, Rama.

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.160
Thank you.

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:29.160
I'm like, if I wanted a series controller, I would have just gone to Best Buy when I go out once a week and bought one.

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:30.160
Yeah.

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.160
So can you return it?

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:38.160
Yeah. Amazon is shipping me an official renewed Xbox one controller and it should arrive on Tuesday.

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:39.160
And it let me keep that one?

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.160
No, I've got to send that one back.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:42.160
Ah, I was going to say.

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:44.160
Well, hey, it was a nice chance to sample it, at least.

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:45.160
Yeah.

02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.160
I would say it's really nice.

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.160
But Jamie, you know, there are ways around certain things.

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:51.160
I'm not going to.

02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.160
So, you know, there are ways around certain things.

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:58.160
Yes.

02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:00.160
And another thing, and I'll be on my merry little way.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:01.160
No problem.

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:06.160
You know how lately Hallmark has been doing a lot of retro gaming ornaments and stuff like that?

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.160
Oh, yeah.

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.160
I got the, uh, the NES, the NES.

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.160
I got a few of them.

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.160
This one has been very popular on Amazon.

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.160
The Super Nintendo one.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.160
I have it.

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:18.160
Did you, did you hook it?

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.160
Did you put into batteries?

02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:21.160
No.

02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:22.160
So wait.

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:24.160
Wait, I think I have that one.

02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.160
I didn't know it took batteries though.

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:27.160
Yeah.

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:28.160
This came out this year.

02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.160
Oh, this year?

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:31.160
No, then I have, um, the last year, the NES.

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.160
Yeah.

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.160
This, this year for 2021, it's the Super NES.

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160
I need to get it.

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.160
And it goes with three batteries.

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:47.160
And if you put it in, I hit the power button.

02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:49.160
We're waiting to hear.

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:50.160
Does it make you hear it?

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:53.160
No, no sound isn't coming through for us.

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.160
Oh, damn.

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.160
You have to tell us what's it doing?

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:59.160
It's playing on the first level theme from Super Mario World.

02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.160
Oh, that's adorable.

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:04.160
Complete with sound effects.

02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:10.160
Or as Bobby Black Wolf in chat currently says, ordering that.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.160
Good luck.

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.160
Because our fucking callers tonight are just enabling the shit out of all of us.

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.160
God damn.

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.160
I'm closing these lines back up.

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.160
No more phone calls.

02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.160
No more phone calls.

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.160
I'm just kidding.

02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.160
I heart you guys.

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:24.160
If you want one of these good luck.

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:29.160
Cause I've been following Wario 64 for about a week and a half trying to get one.

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:32.160
And when I got one on Amazon, it says it's secure.

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.160
You have it.

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.160
They'll say your order has been canceled.

02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.160
I get another notification.

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.160
I go back and I order it.

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:43.160
I'm told we're going to hold your money until we get one and we'll charge you when it ships

02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:45.160
and lo and behold.

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:50.160
Yeah, I am going to have to, I mean, am I just sweet?

02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:58.160
I've actually been pretty lucky going to, uh, the, uh, the actual hallmark store near

02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.160
my house.

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:02.160
So I might have a hallmark store out in Roseville.

02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:04.160
That's not near your house, but I know that one.

02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:06.160
Well, no, there's, there's one out here in EG.

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:09.160
Um, and I have to go to target tomorrow and it's right next door to target.

02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.160
So good times shopping.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.160
There is a hallmark store in New York city, right.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:21.160
And report authority, but I'm like, I'm not going to spend two 75 to go there.

02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:25.160
The risk that they don't have and spend another two 75 going home.

02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.160
But there's, but they do, they've got like arcade machine, um, ornaments and a bunch

02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:31.160
of different Mario and Luigi ones.

02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:35.160
I got, uh, I think I got like the eight bit Luigi one before you got it.

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.160
Yeah.

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:37.160
Yep.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.160
Bobby says, if you go onto hallmark.com, you can do curbside pickup and Bobby says

02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:43.160
they have five and he can order one for curbside pickup near him.

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.160
So, um, that is another option you could do doing it now.

02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.160
Log it in hacking the planet.

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.160
Um, before I let you go, I got something for you.

02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:57.160
I want to know, um, out here, we were hearing, hearing about hurricane, hurricane, hurricane.

02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:58.160
How you doing?

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:01.160
Is, did that affect you or was that more long Island?

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.160
Give me tropical storm honoree.

02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:04.160
Yeah.

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160
Oh, that was, that ended up being a big deal.

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.160
Yeah.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:14.160
Just, just so you know, technically I live in long Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and

02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:16.160
Suffolk County is basically long.

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.160
Okay.

02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.160
Yeah.

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.160
Yeah.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:20.160
I've, I've, I've been through that.

02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:21.160
Holy crap.

02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:22.160
Uh oh.

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:26.160
And there's a battleship one.

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:27.160
She's in the zone.

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.160
Here we fucking go.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:29.160
No, no.

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.160
My transformers loving self is like, bitch.

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.160
That and even Dan's not going to protest that one to be honest.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:40.160
So I have been seeing a lot of transformer stuff, Jamie.

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.160
I will start emailing you some of the stuff that I see.

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:44.160
Okay.

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.160
Well, you know, I'm not on Facebook anymore.

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:48.160
So that's why I said email.

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.160
Yeah.

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:50.160
Thank you.

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:51.160
You're welcome.

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160
You're welcome.

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.160
I'm glad to see your internet's up and you're not under water.

02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.160
Cause the news out here was making it sound pretty terrible.

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:03.160
That's because I'm in zone B, basically three zones.

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:09.160
You put in your address, A, B, or C if it's zone, a pack your shit and go zone B. You

02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:12.160
might not have to pack, but just be careful.

02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.160
Zone C you're good.

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:19.160
So was fire Island and zone a, cause I bet they were probably.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.160
Remember you need a special bus to get over to fire.

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.160
Yeah.

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.160
They have one.

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.160
Do you want me to get one too?

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:29.160
Uh, yeah, sure.

02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.160
For you.

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.160
Sure.

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:32.160
Actually they're only letting me get one.

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:33.160
Sorry.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:34.160
That's all right.

02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.160
I'll log in and look and see if the Roseville store has them.

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:36.160
All right.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:37.160
Y'all happy?

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.160
Y'all happy?

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.160
You made a sale.

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.160
Y'all happy?

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:41.160
You made a sale.

02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:42.160
Congrats.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:45.160
That's all right.

02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:46.160
All right.

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:51.160
Wrap it up before you, before you sell us some something else, anything else on your

02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.160
mind tonight?

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.160
No, that's it.

02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.160
I just didn't think this was going to turn into everybody buying stuff.

02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.160
Yeah.

02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.160
Yeah.

02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.160
Yeah.

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.160
Happy holidays.

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.160
They're not letting me do the pickup.

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.160
All right.

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.160
Take care Rama.

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.160
All right.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.160
Take care.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.160
All right.

02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.160
Listen to anime jam session Tuesday nights hosted here at VOG network.

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.160
All right.

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:14.160
Uh, I think that was all the, uh, the calls that we had there waiting to go.

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.160
Um, let's see.

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.160
Uh, Oh, as 200 Matt says, yeah, fire Island was evacuated.

02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.160
I actually, I went there once.

02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.160
Uh, I think it was like 2006.

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.160
Uh, don't get it twisted.

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:31.160
It wasn't anything scandalous that you said, like me and my lesbian friend took the ferry

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:32.160
out there.

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.160
He just to see what it was all about.

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.160
Cause we always hear about fire out, fire out and like nothing was that we saw a house

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:43.160
party going on and we walked to the beach and we were like, all right, it's cold.

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.160
Let's go back.

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.160
So that was my trip.

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:49.160
That was my exciting trip to fire Island way back in the day.

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.160
But I hope everybody's okay.

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:52.160
All right.

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.160
Um, I guess that's it.

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:56.160
We didn't get any, uh, emails tonight.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.160
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:01.160
The listeners have had enough say tonight on our wallets.

02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.160
So that's where every gamer has a voice.

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.160
Nope.

02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:06.160
We're done.

02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.160
We're done.

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.160
No.

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:12.160
Uh, Rama says you have to go to fire Island during June for obvious reasons.

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.160
Someday, one of these days, uh, I'll get back out there.

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160
All right.

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.160
Oh, I didn't even check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories, but I

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.160
guess I should do that.

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.160
Loki.

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.160
Do you have any last minute stories?

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.160
Uh, no, but I was gonna mention a lot.

02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:25.160
57 57 is a pair of hair paradise.

02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:26.160
Second mix.

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.160
And of course lot Thursday, three 17.

02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.160
It's ready for shipping to 50 inch monitors included Derby owners club.

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.160
Get out.

02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:40.160
I don't have room for a doc at my house.

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.160
A Derby owner's club.

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.160
We need to just put in and have like the big warehouse.

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:48.160
That's nothing but like our own combined personal arcade.

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:49.160
That would be very cool.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.160
Yeah.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.160
Yeah.

02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:52.160
Oh my gosh.

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.160
All right.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:56.160
Uh, well that is going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.160
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight.

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:02.160
Hey, if you like what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two, help us spread

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.160
the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.160
are here to put out on air.

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.160
So, um, spread the word, um, uh, neatly leave us a nice five star review on a site like

02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:16.160
iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this podcast.

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:22.160
Uh, please consider that, uh, auto host at, uh, at VOG network auto host for VOG network

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.160

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:27.160
So, um, thank you so much, uh, for everybody that does that.

02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.160
I really appreciate you.

02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:33.160
Uh, if you are feeling so inclined, you can also shop at VOG network.com slash shop.

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.160
If you want an orange on radio shirt like I'm wearing tonight and Jamie is now as well

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:37.160

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:38.160
Uh, you can check that out.

02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:41.160
Um, and maybe even more to come soon in the future.

02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:43.160
So, um, that is about it.

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.160
Now we're going to get final thoughts.

02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.160
Um, dark soccer, are you streaming tonight?

02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:48.160
I am streaming tonight.

02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.160
So we'll start with you.

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.160
All right.

02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:56.160
Um, uh, pig is the best killer in dead by daylight.

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
And if you argue with me, you're wrong.

02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.160
All right.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.160
Uh, have a good one.

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.160
Enjoy.

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:02.160
Have a good stream.

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160
I'm popping out now.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.160
Yep.

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:05.160
Sounds good.

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:06.160
And, uh, let's see your final thought.

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.160
Loki.

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:13.160
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to try to work in some more games through out my week.

02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:15.160
So I'm not just playing Minecraft all the time.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:16.160
Good idea.

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.160
Although Minecraft is cool too as well.

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:19.160
Don't get me wrong.

02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:20.160
Yeah.

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160
I'm still playing that.

02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:22.160
Yeah.

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:25.160
And, uh, my final thought is I I'm going to keep, keep sampling some games on that cloud

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:27.160
gaming Xbox stuff.

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.160
Cause it's pretty fun.

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:30.160
So, uh, and I need to play more 12 minutes.

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:31.160
I didn't even talk about that.

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.160
I started 12 minutes and I didn't get very far.

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:35.160
I got distracted and that was that.

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:37.160
So maybe next week we'll talk a little bit about that.

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.160
Lots of games to talk about.

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:45.160
Uh, we will be back next week and that will be our last show for a couple of weeks because,

02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:47.160
uh, there is no show labor day weekend.

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.160
Uh, as, as has been the case for like seven years, ever since I started going to dragon

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.160
con, uh, there hasn't been a show labor day weekend.

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.160
So just keep that in mind.

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.160
We'll be back next week, but we'll, we'll not be here in two weeks.

02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.160
So we hope to see you next week for an all new OLR.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:03.160
And my apologies, I should have put this at the beginning of the show, but my apologies

02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:04.160
to the podcast listeners.

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:08.160
Um, because the cast took forever to get up on the feed this last week.

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:13.160
Um, because the show had a major tech kick up and when that stuff happens, it just takes

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:15.160
me a lot longer to put together.

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:16.160
And I got really lazy.

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:17.160
Sorry guys.

02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:18.160
But there's also a lot going on.

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.160
And then I had internet issues here.

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:23.160
I'm actually glad the internet held out tonight cause we were having internet issues and I

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.160
was a little worried we weren't even going to get to have a show tonight.

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.160
So thank you internet gods for holding out tonight.

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:29.160
I appreciate that.

02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:30.160
All right, let's wrap it up.

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:33.160
We'll see you in seven days for an all new OLR.

02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:34.160
Have a great week.

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.160
Happy gaming.
