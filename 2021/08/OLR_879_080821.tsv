0	13420	If there's one downside to an unexpected and massive spike in success, it's that
13420	16420	when things go back to normal it can look worse by comparison.
16420	20540	That quote this week applies to Nintendo whose 2021 looks quote unquote worse year over year
20540	24660	because Animal Crossing, the third biggest selling game last year has no equal for Nintendo
24660	25860	so far this year.

176220	181620	crazy but he's he's he's kind of grown up to be a little gamer just like you right he plays a lot of
181620	184780	like Minecraft and all that stuff I mean you talk about that a little bit on the show he's doing all
184780	190660	the prickly roadblocks roblox all roadblocks yeah does he create in roblox because I know he was
190660	195820	going to um those coding classes um pre-covid he went he went well he he did actually go to
195900	203180	a summer camp not that long ago like I think sometime in July um to learn how to make levels
203180	210740	and uh worlds and roblox I don't think he does anything with it he just basically plays I don't
210740	215420	they play a lot of this thing called Brookhaven which is kind of like a roleplay game mm-hmm but
215420	219100	not like a traditional roleplay game it's like I'm gonna pretend to be a high school student you
219100	225260	know type of thing or um I don't know my son just my my younger son keeps talking about it all the
225260	232860	time he watches this guy um omg I guess who's on youtube that there's like lore in the game
233660	238540	about this agency or something I don't know so they they kind of go between that and there's
238540	243820	this other ninja game that they play it's kind of like a it's not a clicker game per se but it's
243820	250220	it's like that set up you know where you grind something and then you can you kind of prestige
250300	256780	or whatever and you get more you know bonuses towards earning in-game money and stuff like that
256780	265500	see I remember Becky's son was into this pirate 101 mmo for kids I that and that's different than
265500	269900	puzzle pirates which I think we all played at one point or another I actually didn't play puzzle
269900	273980	pirates oh you didn't I thought you did at one point nope okay I thought about it and never did
274620	279820	like I am with many a game it's it's interesting though to hear how like 11 year olds are are you
279820	285900	know exploring through things like um you know the pirate 101 or uh roblox or minecraft or whatever
285900	292940	because here comes uncle roberts back in my day I don't know about you guys but we had neo pets
292940	298060	and Gaia online we didn't even have that shit I'm talking about when like I was 11 and 12 we didn't
298060	303500	have any of that shit on Commodore 64 you know we had we had pen and paper and so we would draw
303500	308060	our little dungeons on the pen and paper complete with like the item store that you could shop at
308060	313660	beforehand and we would draw I know some of you kids did this too that like you draw out the thing
313660	317580	and like your little like here's where you start here's the final boss here's the pit of something
317580	325020	and whatever and then it's it's basically dnd without dice and like your own house rules it's
325020	330620	basically that that's that's what we did without roblox has we used to use the study lab though
330620	335820	this is when I was a senior in high school my friend Ashley and I would make up our own rpg
335820	342780	and then we would just spend an hour role playing um now I will say uh when I was around 13 in
342780	347500	junior high and I guess I would be like 12 we did play scorched earth on lunch break in the science
347500	351740	lab like the science teacher loved it he let us come in there and take over the computers like as
351740	355900	long as like he he would kind of like walk around and just make sure we weren't like looking at porn
355900	359980	or something or you know whatever but like when he saw that we were just nerds shooting each other
359980	364220	with tanks he was like all right these kids are fine these kids are gonna be okay and look at me
364220	372380	now look at you little did he know I'd actually love to see how that guy's doing he was he was
372940	377500	Mr Abe if you're out there give me a holler you never know you know what's funny is that after
377500	384780	I graduated high school I actually in the phone book looked up my french teacher to wish her a
384780	391500	pleasant Bastille day you know my my one of my favorite teachers ever was one of my math teachers
391500	396620	in junior high school and my mom ran into her at the mall right before it's probably about a year
396620	401340	before my mom passed she ran into her at the the mall out in Roseville and I guess they had like
401340	405900	they she recognized the teacher and they had a pleasant conversation and I remember right when
405900	411260	I graduated high school she had had a baby and my mom was like she had a teenage daughter with her
411260	423020	and I was like that baby grew up well I stayed in contact with my favorite teacher after I
423020	428700	graduated and we were friends on Facebook and chatted for a while and she sadly passed away
428700	436940	a couple of years ago yeah that's hard to hear yeah but she was almost another mother to me
437900	445180	yeah and I bawled when I found out but she was an absolute angel of a human being
445820	451260	and was one of those teachers that truly cared about her students on a different level you know
451260	456380	what I mean mm-hmm I hear you like she invested well it was also the gifted classes but you know
456380	460860	so she didn't have like a whole lot of us at a time but she really invested a lot of effort into
460860	468380	us and and so hats off to the teachers out there in the OLR crowd hats off to you those of you that
468380	473180	are out there making a difference thank thank you for what you do unless you're mean to the kids
473180	478140	but I don't think any of you are I really don't unless you're my sixth grade algebra teacher where
478140	482140	you're kind of cool dude but you're also kind of a dick or my high school biology teacher who is
482140	487260	who is not a pleasant person but you know what we're not gonna let one bad egg ruin the entire
487260	491980	you know whatever whatever analogy I was going for though we don't let one ruin it for the the
491980	497020	99 of the great ones the coach Milne was really cool he was my chemistry teacher and I'm friends

694860	698380	I'm taking the positions that this is now an ariana grande podcast
699980	704780	all right um and literally nobody in chat is trying to jump in with an answer there
704780	709580	although sia tabiri says the girl who played penny in hairspray live yes that is true
709580	715900	uh sia tabiri also says the other one from rain on me yes good answer thank you it's flea ding ding
715900	722140	ding gold star you get a gold star for the correct answer because of fortnight yes okay so there's an
722140	727260	ariana grande cross fortnight thing going on so you can actually yeah we talked about it on the
727260	731820	show we did we did we talked about the skin on the show last week yes and how it's unfortunate
731820	738300	that she doesn't say yeah every time that the pickaxe is used but there was an upcoming concert
738300	744060	that was scheduled in fortnight right that is the news this week i wanted to talk about that concert
744060	750300	in fortnight um i did not go in the actual game but thanks to the magic of everybody streaming
750300	754380	everything on twitch now and youtube and things like that i was able to consume the content that
754380	762140	way and i'm gonna tell you guys it was not what i expected whatsoever has anybody ever gone to a
762140	767420	concert in a video game like i know fantasy star online has done them a couple times um i feel
767420	772700	like other mmos like maybe uh like uh warcraft even did them but i feel like i went to a tour
772700	777580	and chieftain thing in warcraft back in the day i'm talking back in ragnarok we used to harass like
777580	784220	a a bard or the dancers yeah yeah oh yeah the mock concerts like in uh that that happened in
784220	790460	ever quest that you're ragnarok every game that had bar now it's huge in final fantasy 14 yes
790460	794940	and usually that involves a bunch of characters up on a stage and like everybody is kind of down
794940	800940	below just kind of role-playing right in fact i was um i was actually playing 14 with um shane
800940	805420	last night and i was telling him about this and how i thought it was very interesting and he was
805420	809500	kind of like have you ever gone to the thing in fantasy star online because it's just they're up
809500	813500	on a stage and you're down below it's not that interesting and i think that's what many people
813500	817660	thought this was going to be in fortnite and i'm here to tell the other concerts that they've had
817660	822460	there have been like that i'm here to tell you something changed here i don't know if it's
822460	831100	because of of the power that ariana grande has the impact the uh the numbers the cultural iconery
831100	839020	of ariana grande or what it is but it was not that in fact i found the concert experience to
839020	844700	be kind of an artistic experience and it's something very interesting for video games
844700	850700	and that's why i wanted to bring it up so what happened the concert was only about 12 minutes
850700	856060	um obviously i can't show it to you here because some of the audio would get into dmca issues and
856060	860460	i don't even know the visuals might but so just and plus we're a podcast anyway i don't want the
860460	864860	folks listening on the podcast feed to feel left out so i would encourage you go look up you know
864860	869740	a video of what was going on with this thing and basically what happened there was a whole like um
869740	873580	it was like kind of like an experience type of thing your car so it's all run in the fortnite
873580	878380	engine but your characters get teleported to these scenes that kind of go with some of the
878380	882140	different songs that are playing like before ariana comes out there's one where you're kind of
882140	886540	like bouncing around on some different flowers you know in the scene or whatever and then there's
886540	891180	another one where you go into a mini game where you're like shooting planes and stuff like that
891180	896620	and you're like on the plane and then everybody kind of like crashes i don't know and you have
896620	902700	to like revive people and that's when ariana comes out and she she also is like kind of like revived
902700	909020	and she starts singing um yeah players are strapped into planes and then there was a whole sequence
909020	914940	where there was a what they're calling mc escher kind of like stairs and pillars where um she's
914940	919100	kind of slowly walking up the stairs and she has this big hammer and she's singing one of her
919100	926620	songs she's actually singing the duet she did with um mac miller who passed away um a few years ago
926620	931580	and obviously that was very you know tragic for for her um and a lot of people saw that as a
931580	937740	tribute to him like she was climbing up a stairway to like heaven or something to like i don't know
937740	942540	knock on the door or however you want to interpret that the point is this was a very she just went
942620	948220	from zeppelin to dylan this it was a very artistic thing and you know if we're going to continue this
948220	953980	conversation about video games or art i'm here to say i'm just as shocked as anyone else honestly
953980	959420	that fortnite and ariana grande brought us this very artistic kind of really neat thing this past
959420	963900	week i need to find this on youtube or something you really should it and it and again i stress
963900	968620	it has yes the ariana grande skin is in fortnite and you can go play fortnite with that this thing
969340	973420	was none of that this this had nothing to do with fortnite except for the fact that it was
973420	977580	running in the same engine and therefore we had a lot of the same emotes a lot of the same ways to
977580	985180	move around and things like that but it was not a you know one versus 100 type of thing so um
986060	991820	it's really interesting i i i'm curious did anybody in chat actually check this out or see it
991820	996540	and did you kind of take away the same impression i did that like this could be this this is a
996540	1002620	really interesting direction for fortnite because i know we've heard in the past like within the
1002620	1007340	past couple months right like fortnite and i think a lot of this might have come with the epic and
1007340	1012940	apple thing or whatever whatever whatever we've heard a lot from epic the past few months but i
1012940	1018460	feel like epic has talked a lot about how they don't see themselves as a game as much as they
1018460	1025180	see themselves as like a pop culture or a pop and we we were all kind of sitting here going what
1025180	1030300	it's it's a fucking game it's fortnite like don't like you're not taking yourself like
1030300	1034940	just accept what you are fortnite and now that i've seen this i'm kind of like oh
1036220	1043900	i see where they might be trying to go with this like fortnite is the canvas upon which this event
1043900	1051340	was sort of drawn honestly so um let's see sg100 matt says i didn't and i kind of want to watch the
1051340	1054700	video for it now yeah check it out it was only like honestly when all said and done it was only
1054700	1059660	like 14 minutes start to finish like it's not a long concert in the traditional sense it really
1059660	1064140	felt more like an interactive music video quite honestly because i don't think she was performing
1064140	1068140	it live or anything like that it really just sounded like it was the studio recordings to
1068140	1074940	be honest um tiger claw on chat says fortnite is more like a game that's a service i think
1074940	1082140	yeah that's probably a big part of it as well um let's see uh tryna see uh up in chat as well
1082140	1090060	interesting sg100 matt says fortnite is more mtv than mtv this is like kind of revolutionary in
1090060	1095180	terms of music video type of sphere that's what i'm saying that's why this thing kind of took me
1095180	1100860	by surprise i wasn't expecting it i was expecting ariana grande up on the stage doing some twirls
1100860	1105580	singing you know maybe either a new recording or something of some of her greatest hits
1105580	1110540	and then you know but spend twenty dollars on my dlc thank you bye thank you next you know that's
1111180	1118780	that's it but it wasn't that at all um yeah let's see uh and yyr of course is bringing up the music
1118780	1124300	game related news here yes ariana grande is also related to the music games and ddr uh ariana
1124300	1130380	grande was in ddr except break free was cut from ddr last month after being in the game for five
1130380	1136700	years whoops the licensing ran out that's no fun now that uh now that the game is mandatory to be
1136700	1143580	online um bobby blackwolf in chat says i've seen some of these music video experiences in the past
1143580	1149020	but none have been as big as this the chain smokers did a psvr experience for one of their
1149020	1156780	new singles yeah i saw a psvr thing for i think it was utada hikaru uh they did something for
1156780	1162460	uh kingdom hearts it was like a live studio show where they were singing um one of the kingdom
1162540	1168940	heart songs and you could look at it in vr um and i've also seen the literal vr music videos like
1168940	1175500	i think it was bjork did a vr music video or it was like a youtube 360 like really close type of
1175500	1182620	thing so it's yeah there have been those experiences but still there was this this felt different than
1182620	1189100	any of that um is that it really just felt like it was an entire it kind of you know what it it
1189100	1195660	actually reminds me of i'm gonna throw it way back do you remember on the old school computers
1195660	1200860	especially the commodore 64 but i'm sure this was done a little bit on apple 2e's and stuff too but
1200860	1205820	especially the commodore 64 because of the sound chip and the particular unique sound and music
1205820	1213180	that that did do you remember the demo scene and the demos that would come out bobby i know you're
1213180	1218540	gonna light up with this i know that was that was your scene when you were younger that's what this
1218540	1224860	ariana thing reminded me of is that and those those um demo things would be like a like a song
1224860	1229500	might play and you would see like a it would like push the graphic chips to do something on the
1229500	1234780	screen and then like maybe a different part of the song it switches a little bit go look up like an
1234780	1240460	old school like happy holidays commodore 64 compilation or something to see like what
1240460	1244380	you know it's so show different scenes of the holidays what would play different like um
1245340	1250620	christmas carols and things like that uh bobby says really it was about the amiga for the demo
1250620	1255020	scene that's right the amiga really stepped that up even more and bobby points out of course the
1255020	1260300	pc demos yes that was still a thing even in the 90s and um i think that name is showing up black
1260300	1265420	on black yes it's jason hi it's our voiceover man jason saying demo scene is still very much alive
1265420	1271820	as niche as it ever was honest and i i hope nobody hates me for this comment because it's actually
1271820	1278620	meant to be a compliment the ariana grande concert felt like a mainstream demo scene project
1279820	1287900	honestly it's honestly what it felt like to me so um jason it might be the way things are set up
1287900	1291820	on my computer your name is black and it's just i'm on night mode over here so it's coming up on
1291820	1298060	a black background i wouldn't worry too much about it um let's see zen monkey 11 in chat says i go to
1298060	1303500	concerts in alt space vr they have holograms in there so you see the real artist in vr in
1303500	1309180	front of you not on a screen zara larson did a roblox mini concert the metaverse is real and
1309180	1314380	it's here i'm all for it saw the ariana concert inside of fortnite i try to experience them all
1314380	1321020	it's cool yeah now that i've seen this one like if another artist does one that i that i like or even
1321020	1327980	like kind of like like like for i i'm kind of into little nos x right now because i think i
1327980	1333180	i love how he's pushing people's buttons right now and the music videos and stuff you know it's like
1333180	1340140	fortnite is more playstation home than playstation home is you know because it could be like this is
1340140	1345020	like kind of you know you have this world that exists that you put stuff into it like these
1345020	1350300	different media pieces and stuff whereas if sony were smart they would bring that playstation home
1350300	1356540	but since they haven't um you have these types of venues now where artists can you can have
1356540	1363020	different crossovers with artists and properties and all sorts of licensing i didn't even think
1363020	1368780	about that but you're you're you're you're right on that um cia tabirian chat says i mean i know
1368780	1373900	there were some stand-up comedians who were doing comedy shows and animal crossing well yeah i mean
1373900	1377820	especially especially because of the nature of the pandemic and animal crossing really hitting at the
1377820	1386780	right time i mean the kk concerts are a staple of animal crossing now you know obviously i still
1386780	1392540	miss him though doing his thing in the um you know in the coffee shop because we need the coffee shop
1392540	1397580	back yes we do you put that side by side with the ariana thing and it looks a little sad but
1397580	1401900	i mean it's it's it's still it is what it is for that game and it was kind of like
1402540	1407580	it warped you out of the traditional world and had that credit sequence you know as basic as
1407580	1413820	it is it was still something kind of interesting and different um jason our voiceover guy is uh
1413820	1419100	continuing with a comment about way back in the day beastie boys did a live internet concert back
1419100	1425820	in the 90s i'm talking like real video era quality and it was just a single camera angle with audio
1425820	1431340	of course yeah yeah that's that's like a streamed concert type of thing and honestly again i think
1431340	1438940	that's what a lot of us expected from this but it really was different um you have low-key
1438940	1443580	playstations missing out from not rebooting home but at the same time playstations really trying
1443580	1448140	to push itself is like the place you want to be playing fortnite even though fortnite is available
1448780	1453340	literally everywhere else except you know that that little spat epic has going on right now but
1453340	1457500	we're gonna we're gonna overlook that it's available a variety of different places than
1457500	1463580	just in most places most places yes so um st100 matt says i don't think playstation home had
1463580	1468700	concerts but i feel like there was a watch a long or listen along communities i kind of remember
1468700	1473260	there was watch longs in the olr house in home but then sony updated the game where no media
1473260	1478460	could be played at home yeah there was a lot of potential in home that really went unrealized
1478460	1483820	like i feel like just when home was kind of like finding its rhythm and where it could belong and
1483820	1489100	really blossom somebody just pulled the plug and like on on like the development front it was like
1489100	1493740	no we're not spending another dime on trying to make this better or trying to establish some of
1493740	1498460	the copyright issues or things like that like i really think they just they really yanked that and
1498460	1505180	now fortnite even though fortnite doesn't really feel like home to me but i i i get that comparison
1505180	1511580	i get why you're saying that um zeba in chat says synth riders oh yeah that vr game you brought up
1511580	1517180	in the email has three experience songs that you are inside a vr version of the music video of the
1517180	1522140	artist much like in the background of ddr oh that sounds neat that sounds kind of interesting it's
1522140	1527580	different way to do it uh and bonds 006 says i would go back into home i i would absolutely
1527580	1531900	give home a second chance i'm really surprised they didn't bring it back with the vr i thought
1531900	1536460	for sure that was something they were gonna do was try to take on the vr chat second life type
1536460	1543100	of angle but for whatever reason they didn't so um interesting yeah as jonah matt says ps home was
1543100	1548940	both the butt end of jokes at its time and also way ahead of its time there's things like that
1548940	1557340	in gaming um that just one versus 100 on xbox i'll say that i'll say that until you pull the plug on
1557340	1562300	this show that thing was way ahead of its time hell even the things that preceded it and the
1562300	1569020	berkeley uh games online like acrophobia and stuff like that that was you know that was huge
1569020	1575180	anyway so we'll see what had any any artists that you would want to see in fortnite with an
1575180	1579180	interactive visual experience you know i have to ask this what artist do you want to see in
1579180	1584220	fortnite with an interactive visual experience i feel like i don't listen to a lot of like modern
1584220	1590300	music so i i i'm going back to what i said earlier like a little nos x because he's really pushing
1590300	1594780	the buttons with things right now i'd like to see somebody who's kind of known for reinventions
1594780	1601100	like maybe madonna i'd be very curious um and uh if it's in fortnite she wouldn't need her walker
1601100	1607500	just kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding come on all right anyway
1607500	1613980	uh oh gaga of course who who wouldn't who wouldn't go to a gaga concert even this even the straight
1613980	1618700	people would want to see a gaga concert in fortnite because she's a heck of a performer
1618700	1624380	that would be really great uh any any oh oh i like that answer sg100 matt says daft punk
1624380	1628540	but they're broken up and i feel like they did one over already well hell if they ever reunited
1629100	1633900	that would be a heck of a thing to do that's for sure any any thoughts on on a fortnite experience
1633900	1639260	dark soccer or loki yeah i have two widely different things okay go for it oh well good
1639260	1644300	okay go would be interesting because they do like their uh seamless videos and stuff it's pretty
1644380	1648620	interesting makes it a completely separate side of the spectrum death lock
1651500	1657100	all right i i'm all for a guar concert in fortnite let's see that happen
1658460	1667100	dark dark soccer how about you i want a gorillas one gorillas of course oh god the bands that are
1667100	1672220	kind of technically inclined to begin with that makes a lot of exactly that are animated to begin
1672220	1676300	with yeah yeah absolutely why i kind of you know why i say tech inclined because there's a lot of
1676300	1682380	tech that goes into the concerts and stuff like that that's a great answer um Hatsune Miku why not
1682380	1687900	also that i think has been done you're right i think that has been done uh bobby bobby blackwolf
1687900	1692140	says the tupac hologram in fortnite which was similar i think that could be dangerous
1692940	1700060	um orange right says a weirdo concert fuck yes oh you know weirdo would do it hell yes i love it
1700780	1706940	all right win-win all right let's move on since my co-host did not attend the concert in fortnite
1706940	1711100	but to be fair neither did i i watched it uh i watched a wrap-up summary just because i was
1711100	1715180	curious and everybody on social media was saying it was great and i was like i have to see what
1715180	1719500	was so great about it and then i watched it i was like oh this is not what i was expecting at all
1719500	1724620	so um we were playing video games and too busy not to go to virtual concerts so what kind of
1724620	1728300	video games have you been playing this week we'll start with dark sakura how was your gaming week
1728940	1733100	i played dead by daylight of course you did you played you were playing i beat
1733100	1739580	phantasian you were playing at one in the morning this morning dead by day well because my um
1740460	1749020	my stream time for uh i actually go live at midnight now after such this early sunday and uh
1750700	1757580	i mean i just play until like maybe 2 33 in the morning um i had some good people in last night
1757580	1761420	actually got a raid like right before i was about to sign off i don't know why happens it
1761420	1765980	i'm on my last game and people raid me and it's all good it's always happens to me too
1766540	1771180	so i played another round that i didn't do as great in but i made rank 13 last night which
1771180	1776780	for me is a big deal because i always feel like i completely suck at the game but i'm pretty okay
1776780	1783660	with pig so i like pig i think you it is you i was just gonna say you called it out on your stream
1783660	1788300	when i was watching it's it's it's the fact that you have to kind of use a trackball i think kind
1788300	1793900	of like you're not able to be as fluid as some in some motions or at least you're working up to that
1793900	1799500	still and i think once that kind of gets a little more and i think you're only your pig game i
1799500	1805180	watched last night games actually were way improved from what i'd seen back in the when
1805180	1810860	you first started so i mean i was whipping stuff but i was also super super tired when i was
1810860	1820380	playing but um i figured out my way of countering you know the upfront 360 and i don't know if you
1820380	1828300	noticed that i was doing this but i would chase get close and stop because at the point that i
1828300	1833500	know that 360 is about to happen they will just turn and run right into me because i stopped
1835420	1840300	that's like a nurse that teleports like they start their teleport and then as soon as the
1840300	1844380	survivor runs around they teleport into the ground so that they don't actually move forward
1844380	1849100	it's kind of a similar thing yeah i i did actually get the idea from watching lc
1850300	1858620	and our uh our everyone's favorite you know nurse one trick but uh i got the idea watching and then
1858620	1866940	i was thinking i can't turn that quickly with the trackball but why don't i just stop i've never
1866940	1873660	seen anyone do that except playing nurse so i was like why don't i just stop i think that's
1873660	1878140	clever i think the more you find those workarounds that are unexpected the more you're going to see
1878140	1883180	the rewards that come from that yeah no one expects you to stop like i actually got a
1883180	1891020	compliment on it from a jake player the other day um it was one of my uh offline games and
1891020	1895820	he was he was like you're the first killer i've ever seen just stop and let me run into you
1897100	1900940	and i was like well i have to use a thumb trackball because i have bad wrists we were
1900940	1904620	just chatting about it and he's like also are you a microsoft star like no i'm on stadia because i
1904620	1909340	play on a mac and so we got into a little discussion about it and like in that match
1909340	1916860	like he was like rake four and we started talking about it and he just flat out said hey i'm gonna
1916860	1924220	i'm gonna borrow this idea for my killer games there you go i was like cool i'm glad i'm glad
1924220	1929420	to be of service but um and i've actually started talking through like some of my thought processes
1929420	1935020	while i play and why i do the things that i do and talking it out and getting advice from people in
1935020	1941020	my chat really i think helped me do better and i've also had my builds look at looked at by
1941020	1947340	a few players that i trust so i've gotten some really good advice and i want to actually give
1947340	1954780	a thank you to to lc to hydro to nick and prince uh a few people out there who's given uh laurie
1954780	1961180	bird gave me really good advice on my builds nice and i'm also playing wordscapes because i'm a word
1961180	1970780	nerd a word nerd all right loki how was your gaming week or weeks as it is uh well it was
1970780	1979260	all minecraft um so it was i don't know it was a lot of just like kind of grinding to get stuff
1979260	1985660	done and um i was doing a lot of i was cutting some videos together so like i did a tutorial
1985660	1990540	video i think last week maybe it was this week i don't know everything's starting to blend together
1990540	1996220	um so i did tutorial video to try to drive some more views to my channel so i put that out and
1996220	2000540	and that was pretty successful because there was um it was all about timing because there was an
2000540	2006380	episode that bdubs had done on hermitcraft where he did a two in one like stone generator and i'm
2006380	2011340	like i bet i can make that three in one stone generator because um it should be pretty easy
2011340	2018220	to add uh basalt to it so i did i i put out a design that's based sort of like on his not
2018220	2024940	exactly the way he did it but like a similar looking design and added that in there so i was
2024940	2031180	trying to help you know promote myself that way so that it's it's got okay views i mean so it
2031180	2037340	you know it's working there and then i'm working on my latest episode um pretty soon so in that one
2037340	2044700	i built this because we have issues on our servers still with mob spawns it's an issue with the
2044700	2050780	software server runs it's not vanilla minecraft it's like paper which is like a sort of modded
2050780	2057340	server um it fixes some bugs it also introduces new bugs and so because of that there's a bug
2057340	2063500	with uh mobs spawning correctly so if i'm on the server by myself or i'm on the server with
2063500	2068700	somebody else and they're in another dimension for me there's no mobs spawning whatsoever in my
2068700	2076300	farm so it makes it really hard to run shops on our server and so i had to create a a cash for
2076300	2082140	gold store to get people to sell me gold so i can use it in my gold farm um and so that was
2082140	2089020	a fun build i made it look like a rundown you know strip mall store so um so that'll be my new video
2089020	2094460	and then um yeah so it's been just a lot of that a lot of this week just kind of um
2096220	2100300	i don't know i don't even know what i've been working on i think a lot of it's just been afk
2100300	2105500	in in the server oh and then also working on other projects for people on the server as well so
2105500	2110620	there's some other things um tied with that but i'm trying to get more on track to put out stuff
2110620	2117020	in a regular basis i mean i have been putting up videos about once a week but it's not my normal
2117020	2123340	smp let's play stuff it's been kind of you know here and there so still trying to get that down
2123340	2129660	faster but making progress all right well best of luck on the youtube front make sure make sure
2129660	2136060	y'all are following loki on youtube at loki olr on youtube yep all right uh my gaming week honestly
2136060	2139580	i've been playing mostly a lot of the same stuff i've been talking about in previous weeks on the
2139580	2144620	show uh myself i'm still you know uh moving along in dead by daylight i did a random stream on my
2144620	2149340	own channel on friday that was that was fun except uh jamie you've expressed this too like when when
2149340	2154060	the camera's on i have all bad games and then when the camera's off is when i have my good games
2154060	2159180	although i did i had my one trick bill game um because i had a daily that i had to like get an
2159180	2164460	item and escape as bill well bill was like level one so i ran i ran i was like screw it let's do
2164460	2172300	i ran a game with uh bill with one talent uh borrowed time and oh billiam i did it i i i
2172300	2175580	opened the exit door and escaped that was not the item and escape it was the exit door to scare i
2175580	2179500	opened the exit door and escaped so uh yeah and it was funny because when that happened it was
2179500	2183900	pod culture somebody started spamming that icon from your channel with the the bill with the slash
2183900	2190620	through it i'm like hey you mean the one that i'm doing right now yes in chat so yeah there's that
2190620	2196780	um i was playing some fun fast c14 last night uh yakuza like a dragon i kind of hit a wall
2196780	2200700	uh those of you that played the game i hit that three million yen wall you all know what i'm
2200700	2205900	talking about um and uh so it's it slowed me down a little bit but i am gonna try to uh pick that
2205900	2210620	up because i'm too close to finishing it and too invested in the story to not finish it um
2210860	2215420	i also just some random new stuff was showing up on game pass i was like oh i want to play that
2215420	2222300	again so for example luminous is on game pass now i love luminous i know it's so good it's the
2222300	2226220	remastered version of the original so it has shine in which is like you know the best one of the best
2226220	2231420	songs i've ever had in that game you mean the best song what well there was a holla back girl
2231420	2235740	and luminous too let's not get crazy all right here's the thing that pissed me off though you
2236620	2243500	know how you have to get to level 100 to um basically beat the normal i got to level 94
2243500	2249500	it took me an hour to get there and then i choked i was so mad but i'll just have to play it again
2249500	2254860	um katamari damashi reroll is also on game pass i downloaded it but i haven't played that yet so
2254860	2259260	that's all i can really say about that right now but here's the new thing i want to talk about that
2259260	2264140	i actually tried this week um that is kind of interesting so i out of the blue got a message
2264140	2271580	on my xbox inbox that said you're invited to test out the xcloud service at xbox.com slash play
2272460	2277340	so uh i did and i'm giving you that url because it's uh it's pretty one easy one to remember and
2277340	2283180	maybe you have it you don't know it so check it out um and so i went to um check it out and it's
2283180	2287100	based it is their cloud-based service it's basically their stadia okay but it's it's in
2287100	2293820	the xbox environment um and if you have game pass then you can just fire up any of the game pass
2293820	2299340	games on there otherwise you can fire up um things that i i think i think it might only be
2299340	2303260	game pass games but i can't remember if it's things that you own in the cloud but it's only
2303260	2310220	certain games that have the permission which i think mostly overlaps with um uh uh game pass
2310220	2315820	uh mike defton chat says uh welcome to the xcloud gang rob i barely use it i had to try it out i
2315820	2321020	wanted to see so the first game i played of course was no man's sky because i feel like that is a
2321020	2326140	good benchmark game for me a i've played a fucking lot of it b i've played it on pretty much every
2326140	2335020	platform no i i i'm not i've played it playstation 4 playstation vr xbox 360 xbox one xbox series i'm
2335020	2340780	sorry not the 360 what am i saying the xbox one the xbox series x uh steam i've played that game
2340780	2346540	a lot of different places um i played that on the invidious thing too so i played it on xcloud a
2346540	2355420	little bit um and it was i would say it was um it was fine but i think stadia might be a little more
2355420	2361500	responsive i think the technology might be a little bit crisper on stadia i don't know if
2361500	2368540	it's just that they've had more time to perfect it or whatever the case is um but um i it wasn't
2368540	2373580	bad by any means it's just i would notice the artifacting a little more and especially when i
2373580	2379820	was turning in these heavily graphical areas like my game save was on the um the anomaly which is a
2379820	2385740	pretty graphically intensive area i could notice like it did seem to lag a little bit so um but but
2385740	2390700	it wasn't like it didn't make the game unplayable by any means but i i think for that particular
2390700	2396940	game i would just continue to play my xbox series x version why wouldn't i but the other game i
2396940	2404460	played i played doom the 2016 reboot um and again i did notice some of the stuff with the artifacting
2404460	2410140	and maybe some of the colors weren't quite as vibrant but i did definitely notice it was
2410140	2416300	streaming 60 frames a second and it was smooth and especially a game like that doom which is
2416300	2421740	very fast pace like it actually went a little bit through the first level to kind of get a feel for
2421740	2427820	it and i was kind of like this does play really well for like a cloud-based thing so although i
2427820	2432700	would say in my evaluation this the stadia technology was a little bit ahead of where
2432700	2438700	xbox was at i still think it's really exciting it's not bad by any means and i think where this
2438700	2445020	is really going to shine is being able to test games before you spend like 80 gigs downloading
2445020	2451100	them because you know that doom reboot is like a 40 gig downloader maybe 50 i don't even more
2451100	2455580	well why not stream a little bit and sure streaming is going to take up bandwidth too
2455580	2459900	but streaming for 15 30 minutes is only going to be it's not going to be a like even a gig
2459900	2463180	you know to test the game a little bit out and see what you think about it and then make a decision
2463180	2468380	from there and i think it's also great for these things where it's like uh sometimes in the xbox
2468380	2472940	rewards it's like you need to get an achievement in one of these 10 games and i'm like i don't want
2472940	2477980	to download one of those 10 games now i could just do it through the cloud gaming so i'm really
2477980	2482700	excited too to see what happens when the cloud gaming hits the actual xbox series x i think
2482700	2489820	that will be very very interesting um as 100 matt says i also got that invite as well i look forward
2489820	2494540	to trying it out at some point yeah why not try it out you got it um especially if you have game
2494540	2499580	pass you just are going to have all those games already ready to try out so why not um i have not
2499580	2505500	tried it on my phone yet it is supposed to work in safari or um uh google chrome or whatever
2505580	2510860	depending on what what you got uh it but i just haven't tried it on my phone yet um let's see
2511500	2517180	uh jason and chad says 80 gigs ha call of duty has already eclipsed 200 call of duty was not
2517180	2521580	one of the games um grant that no i don't think grant that on five was in the cloud
2521580	2528460	no uh i don't i don't think so i thought i saw streaming yeah um paitlin hanumea says i got two
2528460	2532860	platinums in no man's sky one for playstation 4 and when i installed it on playstation 5 it gave
2532860	2537340	me a second yeah a lot of people are having that interesting over that flight simulator on there
2537900	2542140	no which surprise or at least i don't remember seeing it i don't want to definitively say that
2542140	2547500	i didn't notice it um i mean that would be worth it because that downloads probably yes it's a huge
2547500	2553820	download but i also think see flight simulator is one of those where i'm like i think it's better
2553820	2559900	if you download it because the 4k visuals are stunning and until they can uh get the cloud
2559900	2568140	gaming at 4k uh i think i think it's it's worth the download but that's me um yyr in chat says
2568140	2573260	omg rob you are a genius i've been downloading extra games just to finish those damn weekly class
2573980	2579740	quests launching them via xcloud is so much smarter thank you ego inflate thank you ego
2579740	2586380	plus plus you inflated rob's ego it's super effective thanks why we are good luck uh and
2586380	2593580	bobby says i think exactly um bobby blackwolf says i think flight simulator is coming later
2593580	2599340	because they're still upgrading x cloud xbox series x right now it's all on xbox one oh that's
2599340	2603980	a i forgot about that thank you oh i'm very curious to see what happens get the old fight
2603980	2610060	simulator then like the emulate that old ass one from like the pcs in 1988 we'll do flight
2610060	2615660	simulator one how about that i think that can that can work right i think i saw a skin in the store
2615660	2619900	where you could do or maybe that's just for the little computer on the plane i don't remember but
2621020	2627660	a flight sim and run flight sim in flight sims yeah that sounds fun why not i think the the
2627660	2633500	crazy thing about flight simulator the some of the shit in the store is why would i ever buy this
2633500	2639420	there's things where it's like download the improved uh airport in whatever city in germany
2639420	2647580	for fifteen dollars what i'm gonna say fifteen dollars on fucking airport dlc like i have to be
2647580	2651580	super serious about my flight sim to spend that kind of money i'm sure there's someone out there
2651580	2658300	that drops it hey you spent your money on whatever you want but for me i was like what the fuck that
2658300	2665820	is way too much money for something like that s2100 matt says zaku would get that dlc i don't
2665900	2670380	even i i need the man to speak for himself i don't even know zaku would get that dlc that's
2670380	2677820	like some of the planes for a couple extra bucks i get that an airport for that much money no
2678700	2683740	anyway that was my experience with xcloud i'm looking forward to seeing how it continues
2683740	2687500	can't wait to stream from my own xbox because apparently that will be a thing that's coming
2687500	2694780	in the future very exciting um and uh i i will say dead by daylight was a game i almost tested
2694780	2699660	um but i was kind of like if i'm gonna play dead by daylight on my pc why wouldn't i just play the
2699660	2705340	steam steam version that i already have on here but it is there all right well you know why i'm
2705340	2711660	playing on what i am because the steam one yeah yeah but um yeah yeah if they ever i really hope
2711660	2716060	they get that cross play working across more platforms that would be lovely we'll see all
2716060	2721100	right we're gonna get back into some more news and uh we'll start it off with oh i guess i should do
2721100	2726620	some quick housekeeping um right now as actually no i'm i'm confident saying this so there will
2726620	2733900	not be a show in one two three four weeks uh labor day weekend there will not be a show i will not be
2733900	2739500	here um right now my agenda has me going to dragon con i'm hearing rumors and rumblings that could be
2739500	2745740	uh maybe not a thing even if they do not end up having dragon con i'm still taking a vacation
2745740	2750060	um i've been working way too hard over the past year and a half i deserve a vacation i'm taking
2750060	2756540	a vacation uh i don't really want to live in the space of negativity so i'm not gonna list out my
2756540	2761340	different options of what i'm going to do if there isn't a con but i'm thinking about it and there's
2761340	2765500	lots of ideas right now so we will see but there will not be an olr that week because i'm not going
2765500	2772780	to be here uh one way or the other so that's that um all right otherwise let's move on we have so
2772780	2778380	but if there if there is a dragon con and you feel up to coming i i get it's a weird year let
2778380	2782460	me know if you're gonna be there i have a lot of panels be great to see you all right let's move
2782460	2788700	on we got a lot of news uh in fact we have this story um again this week but some important
2788700	2795420	developments on the activision blizzard front loki start us off yeah so blizzard president
2795420	2804940	j alan brack is stepping down um good no basically uh you know he was one of the two people that were
2804940	2812460	mentioned by name in the um allegations in the first place so it makes sense that he would do
2812460	2819100	that since you know there's probably going to be some uh stuff coming out about that so he is
2819100	2828860	stepping down he's being replaced by um jen o'neill and mike gabara and then also apparently along
2828860	2834620	with you know all of this kind of all these statements from the company that we're hearing
2834620	2841660	about how you know oh yeah we're addressing the you know the issues and stuff like that but
2841660	2846060	coming from the actual employees themselves and not leadership we're hearing that it's actually
2846060	2852620	not really happening the way that leadership is saying basically saying that um you know
2853580	2862380	there's no no no comment on paid transparency you ignore our calls to end mandatory arbitration you
2862380	2868540	didn't commit to adopting inclusive recruitment and hiring practices um so all these solutions
2868540	2873420	basically that you proposed you're not really addressing any of them or any of the solutions
2873420	2877660	that they propose so it doesn't sound like change is going to be coming anytime soon
2878300	2884460	um so we'll just have to see how this all plays out well for what it's worth and i i i want to
2884460	2890060	just start off by saying i completely agree and support that the employee demands need to be
2890060	2895980	listened to and they need to be responded to and that needs to happen however i think the first
2895980	2903660	thing that had to happen for any of this to happen is j alan brock had to go so the first the this
2903660	2909340	this was the first step it's a step but it's not the finish this not the finish of the last
2909340	2915180	of the story um we all know he had to go he knew he had to go i guess i don't they don't really
2915180	2921500	say if he opted into it or they they uh it doesn't really fucking matter honestly he's gone um and
2921500	2928140	that was the important first step um i think the selections of this the i guess successor temporary
2928140	2936060	successors is interesting uh mostly because uh mike was with xbox and i know we got a lot of
2936060	2942780	pr stuff from him out of xbox a lot of quotes because i i always would joke because mike deft
2942780	2948300	has a very very similar name and so i would always laugh like you know oh act deft at the time you're
2948300	2955820	in the news again you know talking about xbox um so it's i i the we know that he has a familiarity
2955900	2962620	certainly with the um pr stuff uh jen she come i think that is very interesting because she comes
2962620	2971180	from vicarious visions who blizzard just acquired not that long ago so that is very much a sign of
2971740	2976140	we're willing to take this culture in a different direction because she hasn't been a part of
2976140	2981820	blizzard's culture as long but i again i think that's a good thing um and obviously vicarious
2981820	2987500	visions have been doing a lot of things right um so i think i think it's interesting um i don't
2987500	2993500	i don't know if ultimately it will be one of them or maybe another outside party ends up coming in
2993500	2998620	to lead a ceo or what but i think it's an interesting um partnership so that's that's for
2998620	3006860	sure um sj100 matt chat says the svp of hr also left this week which also needed to happen yes
3006860	3014220	i'd heard about that as well uh yes considering hr all of this happened under hr's watch
3014860	3023100	absolutely that individual had to go as well so see you later um who's next uh what what
3023100	3027500	was her name we brought up last week fran town said i'm hoping i got that name oh she needs to
3027500	3036540	go she's i heard she resigned from that council so like i i don't know that's not resigning from
3036540	3041980	the company which i think is what we would like to see but we're seeing movement we're seeing
3041980	3047900	movement yeah oh thank you quest buster thank you francis towns and also stepped down from the abk
3047900	3054300	women's network but she's still in her executive position for now so we'll see what happens um in
3054300	3061420	the coming coming days she just needs to absolutely go i didn't know that either sj100 matt says she
3061420	3070460	deactivated her twitter too well she made some good less garbage on twitter ah so yeah um i i'm
3070460	3074620	really glad though we are talking about you know we're still kind of putting and i think for those
3074620	3079020	that um want to support what's happening and i think it's it's very interesting that i think
3079020	3085500	a lot of people have realized that like a boycott isn't really the path maybe for i mean at the end
3085500	3088700	of the day you need to do what's comfortable for you and if a boycott's what's comfortable for you
3088700	3093020	that's fine but i think there's a lot of people that realize there's a lot of great people at
3093020	3099180	abk that want to continue to support the you know those people the majority of the people who are
3099180	3106380	really great people um and uh i think the best thing we can all do is continue to uplift these
3106380	3113660	voices our retweets our reminders that hey just because j alan brack took the fall for a lot of
3113660	3120380	this stuff doesn't mean that it's over because this poison was uh in a lot of places in the
3120380	3126380	culture and so a lot of these other things have to change so that this doesn't happen again we
3126380	3131500	have to continue to uplift that message need to pump their stomach and get rid of all the bile
3132460	3140540	yes absolutely so uh yeah um i suppose we'll see what happens in the coming weeks i
3141180	3144620	again don't think this is the last we're going to hear this this is three weeks in a row now
3144620	3148620	and i i think this is a story we're going to hear about honestly every week until at least
3148620	3154940	the end of the year so we'll see where this continues to go um anything else on that loki
3154940	3158700	did we get everything well i was gonna say you know it's good that we're talking about it with
3158700	3164460	you know activision and stuff but i would hope that we'd also not forget that ubisoft is also
3164460	3169420	covering up for these types of people as well so i need to put the pressure on everybody
3169420	3175180	and hey in the ea just because we're not talking about you right now don't think that you're out
3175180	3180780	of this either because i i'm willing to bet this culture is everywhere we have not forgotten 100
3180780	3185260	fair call out this culture is everywhere within the tech industry and i know i've said this before
3185260	3189660	on the show and i'll say it again every company should be evaluating these sorts of things right
3189660	3194860	now especially in the tech industry you know this this should be the wake-up call every company
3194860	3201500	needs to find this poison within its culture and as dark sakura said initiate emergency procedures
3201500	3208060	to get rid of the bile pump the stomach pump the stomach so yeah mike deft is saying riot
3208060	3215180	so many companies in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network absolutely so um yeah and a great
3215180	3221020	call out loki this is ubisoft is not off the hook just because the spotlight's on abk right now
3221020	3225260	and i think with a lot of these call outs and things you know especially if you if if we don't
3225260	3229340	see the management really deliver on these promises i think it's going to get us closer
3229340	3233580	and closer to where we all have thought the employees of the industry have needed to be
3233580	3239260	for a long time now which is a union or at least and like i said in last week's show
3239260	3248620	a legal support group is kind of like the first step in that capacity so all right anyhow let's
3248620	3254060	yeah sj100 matt says yeah i'm still surprised eve's at uh ease come on ubisoft still has a job
3254060	3260860	yeah me too i'll quite honestly so and bonds 006 says music industry film industry media all of
3260860	3264860	them absolutely but you know what the music industry and the film industry have at least
3264860	3273580	unions yeah there's that so anyway since loki brought up ea let's talk about ea but it's
3273580	3277420	completely different type of topic we're going to talk about boring financial reports but um
3278140	3281820	kind of something interesting because a lot of companies have been reporting financial results
3281820	3287260	this week and ea is certainly one of them as well um so obviously what we just talked about has not
3287260	3292540	been in the news for ea so hopefully internally they are looking at it um it certainly did not
3292540	3296700	come up on their earnings call at least to my knowledge uh if they said a quick sentence or
3296700	3301740	two about it it did not cross my radar but what they did talk about i know of was uh their
3301820	3307500	financial year and and and how things are holding up there so ceo andrew wilson of ea and the report
3307500	3311580	said it was a strong start to the fiscal year with our incredible teams delivering experiences
3311580	3316220	that continue to bring hundreds of millions of players together uh our expanding ea sports
3316220	3323420	portfolio uh apex legends battlefield 2042 and our leading live services were set to deliver
3323420	3329180	more great games and contents to players this year um what i think is interesting is when the cfo
3329740	3336860	blake yorgensen uh started to talk a little bit about f1 2021 which was codemasters first release
3336860	3341660	under ea because you know ea bought codemasters not that long ago so we had kind of the first
3341660	3347660	release it's and this is a quote from the cfo it's to the testament of an exceptional game
3347660	3351020	development team that was able to produce the right assets to produce the right marketing
3351020	3355580	materials to help us drive this business and the team's working together and you know what i think
3355580	3360860	we don't get enough credit for that ea is a bunch of people who really can work well together and
3360860	3365900	we do a great job of working with other parts of our company and when we bring in acquisitions we
3365900	3371100	work well with them i think the poster child is respawn and you look at what's happened with apex
3371100	3375500	legends this is a team effort and respawn has obviously driven the amazing development of apex
3375500	3379660	but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now it's coming up to almost
3379660	3384140	2 billion in business over two years that's unheard of in our industry and i'm not sure
3384140	3390140	we get enough credit for it well ea there's a reason why you don't often get credit for
3390140	3401980	acquisitions if i may pandemic visceral games maxis software westwood studios black box games
3402620	3408220	play fish mythic entertainment bullfrog what do all those studios have in common
3408220	3418460	ea bought and closed them so that is why ea you don't get a lot of credit when it comes to the
3418460	3422460	acquisitions and things like that in fact people are kind of wary of you when it comes to that
3422460	3426220	that is going to be a trust that's going to take you a long time to earn back congratulations on
3426220	3431820	the success of apex though respawn really did do a great job yes yeah clap hello let's celebrate
3431820	3438780	that yes apex is a great game what did ea do to do for that okay i guess they they put money to
3438780	3445020	advertise it a little bit more and maybe you know invest in a little bit fine you get you get you
3445020	3451340	get a gold piece of um glitter that is that's that's the new award here when you did something
3451340	3457260	so minuscule fine we'll acknowledge it congrats ea you get the gold piece of glitter for your success
3457820	3460220	you you did the bare minimum huzzah
3462940	3468300	thank you for doing what was expected of you but you know who gets the gold star
3468300	3474140	respawn studios sure you can have a gold star too dark but but respawn really gets the credit there
3474140	3479100	because again you know look at the stuff that ea still owns and i you know even if i want to be
3479100	3483340	you know i would say a smart ass but i'm really just speaking the truth when it comes to those
3483340	3487820	closed studios i would even say look at ea's partnership with clump companies like bioware
3489260	3495500	um i don't think that's been a great partnership no it hasn't massive Andromeda thinks that has
3495500	3509180	not been a great partnership in my opinion anyway it's it's been it's been how very uh bonds 006 and
3509180	3516540	chat says when i hear or cea i expect loot boxes yeah but i mean i guess that's part of where some
3516540	3520380	of their but essentially they didn't name star wars and any of that stuff in their financials
3520380	3524380	but i guess that's because it's only related to the news you know in the past few months
3524380	3527500	and what's really done well for them which of course you would expect you know with the
3528220	3535020	f1 2021 and so forth uh apex of course is ongoing sure they're gonna um have some announcements of
3535020	3539580	the things to say there but i just thought that uh that whole thing about you know we should be
3539580	3543500	celebrated more for what we're doing with acquisitions it's kind of like why don't you
3543500	3548220	why don't you pull over a little bit here on some of that those comments you know why don't you why
3548220	3553980	don't you give some of these studios the space they need such as bioware to really make uh
3554620	3560540	good games when they go on sale day one bug-free experiences then we'll say you're being a good
3560540	3568060	partner oh also it's not my job to pat you on the back for doing a job you know what i'm giving you
3568060	3572620	no credit for anything the only credit i'm giving you for is all the terrible things in this
3572620	3578540	industry that's what you can get credited for ea interesting because one of the worst companies in
3578540	3582940	the industry bobby blackwolf and chat says and that's where perception is everything ea games
3582940	3587500	for the past few years haven't had loot boxes yet nobody cares i thought fever still had them
3587500	3592460	because oh no no no no they they still do they still totally do they have the whole ultimate
3592460	3598540	team stuff which is loot boxes so yeah they they have had them they just haven't had them in some
3598540	3605660	games like uh like star wars and um trying to think some of the other ones that they had but
3605660	3611100	yeah they know the the thing is they make so much money from fifa ultimate team that they don't need
3611100	3616140	to put like loot boxes and everything they still have it in madden um and there's lots of things
3616140	3620540	that they kind of fifa just kind of pay for the rest of the company like pretty much at this
3620540	3625740	point like it's just really like if it wasn't profitable for the company i mean you wouldn't
3625740	3631020	have people farming this stuff in giant server warehouse you know with all these playstation
3631020	3634620	fours and stuff like that we just had that last week or the week before i remember that yeah
3634620	3641660	people thought it was bitcoin so like i mean obviously it's incredibly profitable for them
3641660	3646140	so like i'm sorry no you're not a little indie studio we're not going to pat you on the back
3646140	3651420	because you did a good job and like honestly like this last formula one game was probably developed
3651420	3657580	before he even acquired codemasters so you get no credit for that i'm sorry like just you get
3657580	3664780	nothing you lose good day sir uh stirlock in chat says fifa ultimate team is so bad there's a
3664780	3670060	literal black market no i'm not joking yeah the uh the playstation farm we just alluded to a
3670060	3676060	little bit ago uh as shown under matt says you get a participation award ea to pin on your fridge
3676060	3680220	now take your jukebox it goes even farther back to that remember when they your account got hacked
3680220	3686060	because of uh and got stolen and people bought you know fifa ultimate team stuff do i it it's
3686060	3690140	been it's been years yes i understand that but like this thing has been going on for a long
3690140	3695500	time like and these these are the guys that wanted you know online passes and stuff like that for
3695500	3700620	used games like ea is just an evil company i'm sorry i'm not going to ever forgive you for any
3700620	3706860	of this stuff you're an evil company and you're always going to be an evil company period you
3706860	3712780	know what though i'd rather these type of evils than the other evils that have been in the news
3712780	3718220	hate to say it but obviously in a perfect world you know what it's just different shades of the
3718220	3726140	rainbow okay of evil that's the rainbow of evil all right let's move on i had an x that i would
3726140	3731340	call the rainbow of evil but we won't go there all right let's move on and the rainbow of evil
3732620	3737020	dark soccer it's who i think it is you know which of course you know which which x it is
3738060	3743900	yeah all right moving on that was a choice i don't want to talk about it moving on
3743900	3752460	uh next story dark saga well something that probably comes as a surprise to nobody and has
3752460	3760460	less to do with uh companies actually being terrible is uh the intellivision amico the
3760460	3764780	the console that a lot of people have been like super excited mitigated about
3766060	3773500	well it's been delayed again um it was originally supposed to come out in october 2020
3773500	3780300	and then it got pushed back to april 2021 and then fall 2021 and now uh this email went out
3780300	3787420	to those who pre-ordered and it said that it was delayed further with the pre-orders due to arrive
3787420	3794860	at the end of 2021 um i got that email yeah because you had yours pre-ordered i sure do
3795740	3801260	yeah it says uh and i'll just read a little bit of the content the team at intellivision has been
3801260	3806140	working tirelessly to bring amico our family focused entertainment system to eager households
3806140	3812060	around the world we've grown to a strong and stable company of more than 60 passionate team
3812060	3816620	members spanning three continents representing some of the industry's best talent all of us
3816620	3823980	are extremely excited to share amico with you and going on uh in spite of all these hurdles
3823980	3828860	hampering our ability to fill to fill all orders we are focused and determined to deliver pre-ordered
3828860	3833340	units by the end of the year this will all also allow us more time to optimize our operating
3833340	3842700	system for future game development i'm i'm not mad about it so it's it is what it is it is what
3842700	3847020	it is and i'm gonna tell you why i'm not mad about it and i'm not and i because it's not a problem
3847020	3852460	unique to intellivision as a friendly reminder can you walk into target and buy a playstation 5
3852460	3859020	no no it's been almost a fucking year and you still can't walk into target and get playstation
3859020	3864620	5 you can't get an xbox series x either or an s you can't walk into target and buy the fucking
3864620	3870860	console um which is really unheard of in video game history almost a year out so i think that
3870860	3875980	shows you there's issues there's problems in the supply chain going on nobody can get a fucking
3875980	3881340	graphics card nobody can get a graphics card without pirating it right now so i'm sorry not
3881340	3886620	pirating getting really lucky yeah or yeah congrats like honestly buy a lotto ticket if
3886620	3891740	you got a new graphics card because you've got some real luck right now so like you can't look
3891740	3900220	at this and say like oh this is an intellivision problem no it's an industry problem did intellivision
3900220	3905420	maybe set some of their goals a little bit loftier than they should have perhaps but at the
3905420	3909580	same time nobody could have predicted what was going to happen in 2020 and is still you know
3909580	3915740	happening as of now so again as much as we we could all dunk on tommy talarico for you know
3915740	3919660	sometimes the way his ego comes off and all that stuff i just don't think this is the appropriate
3919660	3927900	place to do that this this is just a symptom of a larger industry problem and that's that's what
3927900	3935740	it is period um uh bobby blackwolf says look at a new car lot same chip shortage is affecting them
3935740	3940140	i didn't even think about that but you're right all the chips that go in uh new cars i'm sure
3940140	3946620	that's pretty uh crazy uh digirama s says rob mid-tier graphic cards are available but they're
3946620	3957180	double retail prices in stores a 1660 super should not cost 379 4 59 retail um quest buster says
3957180	3961420	unless amico has the magic ability to build their own fab plants and supply chains they have the
3961420	3966540	same problems as everyone else yep dr tsuya says exactly everyone loves to kick tommy while he's
3966540	3971420	down but in this instance i don't think they're entirely at fault here no there's other places if
3971420	3978060	you want to dunk on tommy you can do it um i just i think there's other things in this industry that
3978060	3984460	are needing to be dunked on and i think the fact that tommy talarico hypes up his games look we
3984460	3989180	always have those kinds of people in the industry peter molanu was no different than this is no
3989180	3995340	different than this and there's other people hello remember uh no man's sky before and look y'all i
3995340	4001500	fucking stan no man's sky i love that game but was it the game that was hyped up when it came out
4001500	4006220	we all know the answer to that okay so there are carnival barkers in this industry fine
4006220	4011500	and i and i've said this on the show before and this is you know what i respect tommy talarico
4011500	4018620	i think he's a good guy i am very i met my spouse at video games live for the first time in person
4018620	4022380	there's a lot i'm personally thankful to tommy talarico for putting together and making happen
4023100	4028940	i still i can say that and still say but the best business advice i would give them give him is that
4028940	4034860	he should have more visible faces that represent the intellivision amico than just him there needs
4034860	4040220	to be more visible pr faces than just him um and i've said that on the show before and i'm saying
4040220	4047020	it again um because not everybody is buying what tommy's selling and ultimately that's going to be
4047020	4053500	what kicks the system in the butt if they're not careful um yyr says there are some real issues
4053500	4056780	with amico that go way beyond covet or manufacturing problems if you look at their
4056780	4061180	recent videos internet posts you see all kinds of red flags in progress videos of games that should
4061180	4066380	have been done ages ago a rocket's office filled with wastes of backers money and of course tommy
4066380	4071180	attacking anyone who dares to criticize them hence why i said there needs to be other pr people that
4071180	4076700	do some of this speaking as far as the other stuff goes well that the time to pay the piper is going
4076700	4087580	to be coming so yeah we'll see all right moving on let's talk about something else that's getting
4087580	4091900	a lot of hate mail in the industry this week we touched on this towards the end of last week's
4091900	4098940	show but we didn't really dig into it and this story kind of got bigger this week um and so
4098940	4105420	loki why don't you tell us about this yeah so this is it seems like we were also talking about this
4105420	4110860	like at the beginning of the pandemic as well or like somewhat into the pandemic but you know
4110860	4116780	niantic had removed some of the pokemon go safety measures um despite the fact that we're having
4116780	4123340	different variants of covet 19 popping up now so you know there is still the risk of transmission
4123340	4131340	of these new uh variants as well and so uh back in june apparently they had you know started to
4131340	4138780	roll back some of the double distance tweaks and um some of the other enhancements you know being
4138780	4144060	added to the game despite the fact that you know some people might not want to leave and also other
4144060	4150380	parts of the world are having resurgences um in their area um and because of that you know fans
4150380	4155020	of the game have been kind of you know trying to let them know hey we don't think this is a good
4155020	4161500	idea and i've even started like a change.org petition that's gotten over 130 000 signatures
4162140	4170140	and basically saying that the ink should extend this um these enhancements that they had in place
4170860	4176780	right now especially also you know there's you know disabled players as well that these
4176780	4180620	additional enhancements that they had allowed them to actually be able to enjoy the game more
4181100	4189100	um so yeah and then of course with that of course they uh fans were actually saying that
4189100	4194940	they're going to start boycotting the game um because of some of these issues and they're
4194940	4203180	boycott a free game well i mean yeah you you can do that i mean but like if they make money off
4203180	4207900	of people playing the game and buying the in-game purchases so if you boycott the game it does hurt
4207900	4215180	them in the wallet so that's all you can really do um but basically yeah so now you can announce
4215180	4221180	some more legendaries from sword and shield that are going to be coming to port uh pokemon go and
4221180	4225820	uh with those they're going to be part of this ultra unlock thing they have to do these challenges
4225820	4234140	to unlock it between august 20th and september 1st but apparently um they were saying that you know
4234140	4238700	because of you know some of these issues and stuff folks are just going to be kind of boycotting
4238700	4246300	the game um unless they you know come back to you know extending these features that they had so they
4246300	4253020	were trying to trend uh boycott niantic to show their displeasure with the game and i don't know
4253020	4256540	i haven't played pokemon go in a long time pack your bags because you're not going to like the
4256540	4260940	resolution they come up with so the question is going to be how important or shinies to you
4261900	4269900	i i'm i'm trying to be mean or rude but i do think there is a large percentage of people that
4269900	4274140	are signing these petitions and things like that and the number one reason why they're mad and they
4274140	4279580	want things reverted back is that they can no longer hump the pokey stop that was just outside
4279580	4284140	a range of their house anymore for gear all day long or that is absolutely not fair to the
4284140	4291740	disabled community that is but i did not say everybody i said most now the disabled but as
4291740	4295980	far as the disabled community go i i agree that there are issues there and things that that need
4295980	4300700	to be looked at but these are things that have kind of existed for the first four years of the
4300700	4306940	game as well i think they did a horrible job in communicating i said this last week as well is
4306940	4311580	that for them to say oh these changes are because of covid and then they say at the time but we're
4311580	4315900	going to keep them for the foreseeable future which implies there's no end date and then to
4315900	4321100	revoke them when they did and by saying oh well you know now that covid is even though they kind
4321100	4324780	of didn't phrase it that way but they kind of insinuated because covid is winding down we're
4324780	4330220	gonna you know go put back all these changes that we made and i said this last week and i do agree
4330220	4336780	for with this part niantic did stupid with that like they shouldn't have done that but my honest
4336780	4342860	and i've said this a lot they're gonna put that 80 kilometer or that 80 kilometer that 80 feet
4342860	4347020	thing back you're not gonna like what they're gonna do because i'm i'm telling you right here
4347020	4351580	i know how this ends they're gonna put that in there but they're gonna put a cool down on pokey
4351580	4355900	stops like more than five minutes they're gonna do something similar to ingress where maybe you
4355900	4362220	can spin it four times and then that's it no more gear for like six hours or 12 hours um because
4362220	4367980	that's the thing that niantic is trying to stop are the people is that that i really truly believe
4367980	4371580	to be the majority of people signing this petition who are just upset that they can't
4371580	4376540	spend their desk portal and and so forth as far as and again i want to stress as far as the
4376540	4381180	disability issues yes i understand those concerns that's legitimate that's a different issue that
4381180	4385740	niantic has to look into that's an issue that's needed to be looked into for the last four years
4385740	4395100	it's nothing new now um let's see uh bonds 006 in chat says i am split on the radius debate of
4395100	4402460	the pokey stops um and that's it's other folks still uh pod culture says who me abuse a pokey
4402460	4408220	stop never look and i'm not saying like those players are doing anything wrong or bad or what
4408220	4413020	have you i'm just it is playing the game yeah they're just i get like and i'm not trying to be
4413020	4419500	mean again i promise i'm just giving you the reality check right um go ahead i was going to
4419500	4423420	say i've kind of looked at it the same way as the people who complain about no ed and dead by
4423420	4431500	daylight it's in the game it's a function if people use it it's okay it's a function of the
4431500	4437020	game so i don't get mad about it and niantic did botch the messaging on this they absolutely botch
4437020	4441500	the messaging on this and their reply to this community thing which i thought was very impressive
4441500	4446140	that all the community sites got together and demanded they give a response i thought niantic's
4446140	4453180	response to it was very like yikes but again i just don't think you're gonna like where they end
4453180	4458540	up on at the end of this um but i was gonna say i don't fault the people that were you know like
4458540	4462780	pod culture saying i was spinning a stop and all this stuff sure i benefited from it too are you
4462780	4466140	kidding when i would walk around and you know use my bluetooth of course i could hit stops that were
4466140	4474060	even further away but um nobody likes to be given something and then have it taken away
4474060	4481740	nobody likes that that's what this really boils down to um and as far as the whole the other
4481740	4486380	weird thing to me is this whole well number one the fact that they're introducing zassian and
4486380	4492620	zamzata and all this stuff and the the freaking gen 8 pokemon before they've even finished gen 6
4493180	4498220	have done nothing with gen 7 i mean it's just weird like i i can understand that they could
4498220	4503260	you know you sometimes have regions in pokemon that are a mix of other regions is it like this
4503260	4508700	new um uh uh pokemon legends our arceus game that's coming out is kind of like that where
4508700	4513260	it's like a mix or snap or things like that like but it's like it hasn't been in the pokemon go
4513260	4519100	lore until now so it feels a little weird but i don't i do not think this is some resp like them
4519100	4523820	putting gen 8 in the game suddenly the the some of the gaming media is trying to frame it like oh
4523820	4528380	this is a response to the protest and everything going on is niantic's now trying to sweeten the
4528380	4535020	pot y'all it takes a lot longer to prep the artwork the data and all this like this has
4535020	4542380	been in in the works well before they were making any of these changes so that no i don't no no no
4542380	4547420	i don't buy that and that that part kind of makes me roll my eyes when i see those headlines because
4547420	4552380	i'm like y'all don't understand clearly nobody out there is playing this game that's writing
4552380	4561100	about it so anyway um so yeah i mean that's that's my take on it take her to leave it um am i gonna
4561100	4565820	stop playing the game probably not but i mean i just use it as something to kind of like
4566380	4571260	incentivize my walking i don't necessarily need to spend a ton of money on the game i don't think
4571260	4575580	niantic is really convincing me to spend money on the game outside of you know some of their events
4575660	4582140	are pretty cool um but that's you know that's it um the remote passes i guess are kind of neat too
4582140	4587420	but i'm able to get enough coins for that by doing the gym thing um sg100 matt says they emphasize
4587420	4592380	that the game is about exploring and walking they use this as justification of the 40 meter spin
4592380	4597580	radius thing which i get but doesn't the fact that remote rate passes kind of go against that
4597580	4602460	exploration of walking they're calling for no because it makes money and i i think that's a
4602460	4609340	fair call out is that again why their response was not great and having played niantic games
4609340	4615740	for a very long time and understanding that john hanky comes from a google maps background and that
4615740	4619180	is very much about like being out there and exploring especially with street view and things
4619180	4624140	like that like i get and especially when you look at that they're very if you look at niantic's very
4624140	4632060	first app what was niantic's very first app it was not ingress gotcha a lot of people say oh
4632060	4636540	yeah angry nope it was no it wasn't ingress but i don't remember what it was field tripper
4636540	4641100	was their first down and that was i don't think they supported anymore but that was that was
4641100	4647660	where the very very very original uh ingress uh portals came from was this game about kind of
4647660	4653740	you know starting that idea of these landmarks in your city to go exploring and all of that stuff
4653740	4660140	that's where that came from so like i get that that is niantic's mission and honestly for me
4660140	4665260	it's been very successful i've seen a lot of places i would never have gone to if it wasn't
4665260	4669980	for things like ingress i'm gonna specifically call out ingress pokemon go just kind of piggybacks
4669980	4677660	on my ingress experience to be quite honest um no that's absolutely accurate yeah so that part of it
4677660	4683580	i get um but i also at the same time can recognize what has to show in her mat is saying you can see
4683580	4687260	that obvious conflict there and i think that's what a lot of the community is starting to call
4687260	4692940	out is that but if you pay for it you can have this experience and i think you know again there's
4692940	4699900	talk about like poke you stop power ups and stuff like that that maybe could uh yeah um
4701260	4705980	pod culture and chat says field tripper a bunch of bored kids on a bus with tired adults
4705980	4710700	no no no not that kind of thing uh as joe and her mat says wasn't that where the memes of being
4710700	4715900	let off a cliff came from well i think also i've seen those memes about um the the pissed off
4715900	4720940	pokemon go player base and it's that meme of the the guys just happening with map quest back in
4720940	4725020	the day well it's the meme of those guys on the pirate ship and they're about to die or something
4725020	4730460	like that and the one says like uh i'm an angry pokemon go player and then it says ingress player
4730460	4737180	first time that whole thing uh because ingress has had its own share of issues over the years for
4737180	4743420	sure but i've never seen the player base quite well we had that transition to prime that a lot
4743420	4748060	of people straight up didn't like and a lot of people left the game as a result of it and i'm of
4748060	4754540	a minority opinion of sorts i think sometimes prime has made ingress better it took i don't
4754540	4759180	know i stopped playing ingress a while ago it didn't help it took a long time to get there
4760140	4765260	but it now it's made ingress better that first year i don't i can see why people were pissed
4765260	4770140	off absolutely but now ingress prime has made the game better but it just took like what three years
4770140	4778540	to get there so all right anyway let's move on uh oh let's talk about a different nintendo story
4778540	4782620	i mean technically pokemon go isn't really nintendo it's more of like a license type of thing
4782620	4789260	but let's talk about nintendo sales and nintendo financials so nintendo has published money their
4789260	4796460	most recent quarterly report and uh they have uh made a little less money this year uh in the three
4796460	4801420	months leading up to june 30th they had a operating profit of 119 billion yen that's
4801420	4806860	about 1.1 billion dollars that's a lot of fucking money um however it's not as much fucking money
4806860	4815100	as last year when they made 1.3 billion that's a 17.3 percent drop but i think we all was still
4815100	4820300	animal crossing the other year though exactly exactly i was like we can all see what the what
4820300	4825660	what what was happening last year that isn't happening as much nearly this year lockdowns
4825660	4830460	and animal crossing it was the perfect storm combination last year that worked out very well
4830460	4835980	for nintendo we don't like to look at companies profiting off the pandemic um but nintendo didn't
4835980	4840140	that was not nintendo's plan we're profiting off people having to be home it's less of the
4840140	4844700	pandemic you know and they didn't even know that there was going to be a shutdown the same month
4844700	4848300	they released animal crossing yes and as i was trying to get to that was not nintendo's plan
4848300	4852860	like nintendo didn't play it was just the perfect storm that happened that allowed allowed things
4852860	4857660	to get there um but yes they have not had an animal crossings this year quite frankly
4857660	4862860	i don't think they've really had a big game yet this year now i mean some may argue that oh
4865100	4871180	sure mario tennis and all that stuff yeah no um but when you look at later this year we've got
4871180	4876060	wario ware get it together zelda skyward sword will show up in the next um uh right because that
4876060	4881900	was a july release uh metroid dread is coming mario party superstars pokemon brilliant diamond
4881900	4885820	shining pearl so i mean there's a lot of good stuff to look forward to from nintendo and i
4885820	4891420	think the financials will be different um but at the same time if you're upset about 1.1 billion
4891420	4900460	dollars um stop that i'm upset about the 1.1 million dollars that no one's giving me right
4900460	4908860	i would take 1.1 dollars right now every little bit i could use a few more dollars than that
4908860	4916300	um yyr in chat says i thought the drop would be way more not because they're doing poorly now but
4916300	4921500	because they did so well last year yeah like i mean honestly the fact that they only fell 17
4922300	4927420	actually seems pretty good uh sia tabiri in chat says and animal crossing updates yes the game
4927420	4930460	could still use some of those as well i'm surprised they didn't do dlc i think they're
4930460	4935340	done with that though they did and they did one recently i covered it last week yeah that was that
4935340	4940780	was a tiny tiny little bump though we we need something major major uh like that mario thing
4940780	4945020	was pretty cool or something like that would be you know nice or the fucking cafe like you said
4945020	4950460	some more buildings from the other um iterations it was data mine that we were supposed to have
4950460	4957980	brewster yeah man if they announced that i would be immediately back into playing um the gyroids
4957980	4963980	i'm surprised was never a thing this is yeah they're kind of morbid though if you actually
4963980	4971340	know where they came from yeah but we don't have to talk about it um stirlock in chat says
4971340	4975100	i really need to get back into animal crossing i think there's a lot of people saying that
4975100	4977980	but animal crossing at the same time should give us something to come back to
4979420	4989260	right yeah yeah all right let's move on dark sakura well um here's the nintendo franchise
4989260	4996860	that i think uh we can agree is fairly epic and that's going into metroid so they released a
4996860	5005500	trailer um for metroid dread that brings up the chozo um it's it's a pretty short little
5005500	5013580	little trailer it's like you know 34 seconds but it brings up the chozo it you know shows their
5014140	5021500	their sort of hieroglyphics looking uh wall art i don't know what to call it like
5022380	5031580	it's very very egyptian like in nature um and so uh of course in the previous metroid games we
5031580	5038140	always had like a statue or a ghost or something written by one or the chozo
5038940	5043020	uh robot you know that did something on you go to the abandoned ship in super metroid
5043660	5052460	um what people aren't realizing is that there is a whole lot more lore already existing about
5052460	5060620	the chozo and if you look into samus uh into her uh history she was raised by the chozo
5060620	5065180	and actually had some of their dna bonded to her so that she could live on their planet
5065740	5074540	and so i'm actually hoping that we get a lot more throwback to uh her time with chozo you know
5074540	5080380	a lot more of her history with growing up among the chozo and where they all went and what happened
5080380	5086860	to them because you know they also made the metroids and where did that get them i'm really
5086860	5092140	looking forward to it i've always had fascination with the chozo in that series and you know me when
5092780	5099980	i get into a game i really get into the lore so i'm really excited about it and of course um
5100620	5105420	it'll be out october 8th for switch and we'll find out our answers there i reckon
5106060	5109980	yeah i mean samus is a pretty unique character you might say she's the chozo one
5113020	5118460	are you looking at how i'm staring at you right now no i'm not you should be i will be
5119180	5125100	episode from the archive so that pun dies tonight this is me staring at you in judgment
5126780	5133420	just carrying on the tradition of the 23rd maggots that's all all right you are a dad i guess
5133420	5138220	somebody has to bring the dad jokes to this show all right check out they call them dad jokes
5138220	5145580	because they don't want to call them bad jokes hi i did one too now that actually was pretty funny
5146540	5156380	all right moving on come on dad what's the next story yeah dad well uh let's talk about
5156380	5165020	duke nukem again um so apparently uh the embracer group has bought seven different studios including
5165020	5172460	3d realms so they had purchased um basically some of the publishers uh like uh gearbox
5172540	5180860	thq nordic and deep silver uh but now they've bought three realms ghost ship games um what else
5180860	5192300	uh forcefield easy trigger uh dixie uh dixie art and crazy labs so a lot of those i don't recognize
5192300	5200220	but i mean i definitely recognize 3d realms so don't know what that means necessarily in
5200220	5207340	the terms of new games i guess we'll have to wait and see i would like to see a keep well making if
5207340	5212620	they keep making duke nukem games at the um regular rate we'll find out in about 2030
5214780	5222140	yes well there was like um there was a a new 3d like fps game that was done in the
5223500	5229980	build engine so you know definitely the same technology as uh duke nukem 3d but you know
5230460	5234540	pretty awesome polished game they had a lot of stuff with that that retro throwback game yeah
5234540	5239820	yeah yeah yeah so they have some of those i like to see more of those coming along i mean duke nukem
5239820	5248380	he's a hard character to kind of bring into this modern age of 2021 i mean just not necessarily
5248380	5256540	a character i could see a lot of folks liking nowadays um but i don't know more games like that
5256540	5260700	that would be fine i guess like actually now that i think of it you know there's some games
5260700	5267180	that came from the build era that are still kind of doing well so maybe who knows what was that
5267180	5272860	game forever was not good what was that retro that game now it's gonna bug me it it uh it had a like
5272860	5278540	a disagreement with a metal band it was very similar to um some metal band there was that one
5278540	5282140	but there's been there's been actually a few other ones oh i don't remember that was the one i was
5282140	5287660	thinking of yeah i know which one you're i don't remember the name but yeah i it's there was a
5287660	5292060	couple other ones that were also using the build engine that looked pretty awesome there's one i
5292060	5296700	just saw recently it's using the doom engine like the original doom engine but it's like it doesn't
5296700	5302460	look like it's running doom anymore i mean they've done so many tweaks to it but there's a lot of
5302460	5307340	these games i like that where they kind of take this old technology and really enhance it to with
5307340	5313340	the modern visuals but it's still you know the old school engines which is kind of cool
5314780	5320860	or just a mod just a really good mod which you know is a really good mod the the um you know
5320860	5325420	xbox and playstation and all those versions of the game like officially support mods now
5325420	5331260	thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you iron maiden but they changed the name to ion fury
5331260	5335980	yeah i knew it was some metal iron maiden yeah exactly iron maiden had an issue with it and
5335980	5342060	yeah so now it's ion fury yes thank you dark tetsuya gold star for you all right you get more
5342060	5349660	than just the glitter for doing that research for me all right let's move on let's talk about a game
5349660	5354540	that for some people gets a gold star for some people not so much it's pokemon unite which
5354540	5359660	i actually i played a little bit more of that this week but um i don't know i like playing the game
5359660	5364300	by myself isn't as fun like if i can hop on there with friends and stuff it's a little more fun
5364300	5368060	because we have something to talk about but playing with randos gets kind of old to me but
5368060	5372460	i i still as far as mopas go it still is probably one of my favorite ones i'll check it out when
5372460	5377500	it's on mobile phones as well i want to see how it plays on the phone um comparatively but pokemon
5377500	5383740	unite just got a big update so um there is a new update that really went in there and uh changed
5383740	5387260	some balance and maybe that's why i'm pissed because eldegoss kind of got hit with the nerf
5387260	5393500	bat and she can't heal as much as she did before um although i guess her uh special attack move
5393500	5398700	uh can do more so i don't know i guess there's a trade-off there but um like pretty much all the
5398700	5402860	other pokemon got some type of changes i i'd list them all off but it was just about everybody
5402860	5407580	uh so that here earlier this week and i believe it's also bringing a spectate mode to the game
5407580	5411500	although they did not enable that at first um i can't remember if that's in there now or if that's
5411500	5417980	still coming um but uh next month there is plans for the mobile release and there will be cross
5417980	5423020	platform play between of course the switch and smartphones um and if you log into your nintendo
5423020	5428220	account or your ptc that's pokemon trainer club account you can cross save data in progress which
5428220	5432620	would probably be a good idea i'm just curious how moving around is going to work on the mobile
5432620	5436940	phones but i guess if you just tapped on the screen where you want to go it might work out
5436940	5441500	um so interesting mike defton chat says i'm playing it right now well i hope you're i hope
5441500	5445260	you're doing well i hope you're winning who's your main mike deft that's what i want to know
5445260	5449420	because i was i will say the one thing i did do this week i i'm like an eldegoss main right i
5449420	5454940	played like 98 of my matches with eldegoss i bought snorlax and try to match with snorlax
5454940	5460060	because i i like snorlax as a pokemon and uh i thought the moves would be fun oh boy did i get
5460060	5466540	beat oh boy did i get beat i guess i need more practice okay nine tails i was looking at i was
5466540	5470860	looking at that's because it's a lowland nine tails slash volpix right i was looking at that
5470860	5476300	one because i like the whole like freeze mechanics and stuff um maybe i'll check that one out next
5477260	5481820	all right anyhow it's uh time for our next segment here at orange launch
5481820	5486140	radio which uh i would say needs no introduction but we actually have a special introduction
5498220	5503740	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull
5503740	5508700	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
5510060	5517100	but as we know in a 2021 twist once a month we get a flag that means fucking weird arcade game
5517100	5522940	and i believe that's what dark soccer has picked for us tonight right oh believe me we get the flag
5523740	5528940	so basically the game that i chose and on its own it doesn't necessarily seem like it should
5528940	5534220	be a flag until you actually see it played the game is final furlong which i have brought up
5534220	5541580	many many a time as the horsey humpin game it is a horse racing game developed by namco it came out
5541580	5551100	in arcades in 1997 um it is one of the only two games that run the namco system 22.5 gorgon
5551100	5559660	hardware which is a early revision of the namco system 23 hardware so basically in this game you
5559660	5564780	have three checks to choose from six and a half furlongs a one mile and a one and a half a mile
5565340	5570860	you have different horse classifications you have like a leader a front runner a mid runner
5570860	5575660	a strong finisher and two quote almighty runners who like to keep their position
5576220	5582060	you sit on a saddle as it were and you have this
5583900	5590780	i this thing it doesn't really look like a horse it's got like well it kind of kind of does but um
5590780	5597660	i've seen the ones where they don't exactly like look exactly it's just so weird they're just weird
5597660	5604460	okay they kind of look like horses but you have this bar you hold on to and the thing is is that
5604460	5609820	if you fit on it then you're supposed to ride it like it's a horse and you know move with it
5609820	5615020	and everything but i've seen people who are way too tall for this thing who just stand up and
5615020	5623820	push at it and people look like they're humping the horse just just what it's just it's fucked up
5624540	5628860	um we had one i don't know if they still have it because i haven't been there in ages but
5628940	5634780	roseville golf land had one no they had one i remember they had one at uh country club lanes
5634780	5640380	for a while um but that's gone unfortunately roseville golf land had one that's tucked over
5640380	5644780	like along the same wall as the entrance that's where i remembered it being and then they replaced
5644780	5652220	it with derby's owner club long gone yeah it's been a while it's been a while years um and uh
5652540	5660140	uh basically though it did get a rating as one of the best games overall with the quote from
5660140	5665020	gerald lynch for tech radar saying the machine was brutal popping you a straight a giant plastic
5665020	5670300	horse you'd propel yourself forward by getting up your steed rocking maniacally forward and
5670300	5675660	backwards to speed the beast up best played with two players the marathon like events would last
5675660	5681740	so long you wouldn't be able to walk for a week um yeah that's what they say about humping sometimes
5681740	5690540	too just saying um at any rate there actually was a sequel to final for long um and that was
5690540	5699900	final for long too aptly named one we had actually yeah i'm pretty sure that that was it um and it
5699900	5710620	had like some more options it came out in 1999 um and it also was uh i want to say it also ran on
5711740	5717980	no it ran on system 23 it ran on system 23 so it did use the upgraded system um both of these
5717980	5724540	though i do believe could link up to four players playing so it was kind of neat it was just i mean
5724540	5731020	the thing that that again classifies this as swag for me is just how how it looks when you play it
5732060	5739660	yeah they look like less of them riding it more of them choking the horse violently yeah yeah
5739660	5742380	they're they're they're doing the hump with the horse but
5744540	5748060	they're they're getting their fictitious catherine the great on
5751180	5758140	but yeah that's that's the game final furlong all right there it is let me give my earbuds back in
5758140	5764060	there classic flag of the month final furlong and um i'm sorry i ran to the restroom so you
5764060	5768300	guys probably brought this up but we had that one locally at a country club right yes i also
5768300	5772700	brought out the one that they had at rvgl as well i don't remember i don't remember that one
5772700	5780860	and i had one for a hot minute fun all right yeah and honestly uh derby owners club was a much
5780860	5786140	better horsey game i'll be honest it was but but but not quite as much fun to watch as this one
5786860	5793340	i've injured myself on final furlong i wonder where all those derby owners club games have gone
5793580	5799100	i think the one from what i understand the one at rvgl is still there but i also haven't been
5799100	5805100	there in like two years no it's not i i'm pretty i want one the last time i was there which was
5805100	5812220	back in 2020 i'm pretty sure it was not there anymore i i usually walk around because if it
5812220	5816940	was there i would totally be playing it so i'm gonna kick dan's mustang out of the garage and
5816940	5825500	get a derby derby owners club kidding that's worthy really nice um i swear the last time i
5825500	5830140	was at a dave and busters i think the one of the great mall they still had this set up for it but
5830140	5835180	granted that was a few years ago at this point so i haven't checked on it lately that's a dnb
5835180	5842540	that has gone kind of downhill ever since they got rid of the uh battle tech thing oh yeah i
5842620	5847100	forgot that was battle tech in the day too now it made me nauseous as all hell but the battle tech
5847100	5851500	pods were really fun well yeah those are the ones that bobby's talked a lot about those on his show
5851500	5857340	because they still they still bring them to dragon con every year i used to play that back in was
5857340	5864940	that they had it was i never was called now in the downtown plaza in sacramento it was like a
5864940	5874060	bunch of uh bars fuck that's america live america live that is a throwback locally here that place
5874060	5877820	that is that is now an arena well yeah yeah
5880380	5884780	pod culture brings up the star wars pod it's kind of not the same thing though because you're not as
5884780	5893900	immersed yeah this is like um it's very you know the battle tech had a very complicated system
5893900	5899980	yeah but it was cool uh yyr says uh pretty sure all the dave and busters got rid of derby owners
5899980	5905100	club by now well that's unfortunate but at the same time it probably wasn't bringing in the money
5905100	5909580	and they probably wanted to put in you know i don't know whatever stupid machines make money
5909580	5915420	i just remember the names we would name our our horses oh yeah all the silly names who come up
5915420	5921500	because i still have a bunch of my cards um i haven't um been to a dave and busters a long
5921500	5925820	time ever since round one was a thing i don't think i've been to a dave and busters since
5925820	5933660	round one kind of started being a thing i went to dave and busters about a it had to have been like
5933660	5941180	in january or so because i met up uh last year because i met up with jd and we went to the one
5941180	5948780	that's like way out closer to daily city oh yeah yeah way out there okay the ceremony yeah yeah
5948780	5953420	yeah because that's where it was already at and so that's where alan lived when we first
5953420	5960300	started dating was that area this was quite a quite a commute yeah yeah um uh i was gonna say
5960300	5965020	that round one here locally in roseville still not open as far as i know unless it just happened in
5965020	5970140	the past couple weeks but i don't think so and uh that's it's weird because round ones have been
5970140	5973820	open i've been to the one in concord since the pandemic i was there just recently a few weeks
5973820	5978140	ago before the the delta variant kicked up and all that stuff but still it's still like i'd
5978140	5982220	they're not shutting businesses down again they're saying get vaccinated and wear a mask
5982220	5989420	and you know most businesses are staying open um so uh um i've been around one recently so
5989420	5992940	it's weird that the one in roseville still isn't open but i guess maybe they really just want to
5992940	5999180	wait out the the quote-unquote worst of the pandemic behind they're just behind on getting
5999180	6005100	it done because there's also the movie theater that's supposed to go above it or blow it yeah
6005100	6008860	another industry that got hurt through all this pretty yeah it was like a
6009740	6011660	cinema or something like that so it's
6013900	6019260	yeah i i i look every time i'm at the mall and it's it's never open i'm like oh i wonder if some
6019260	6022940	of these movie theaters are waiting for that um was it a warner brothers deal or that whole like
6022940	6027660	hbo max thing they'd only promised that through 2021 so i wonder if some of these are waiting for
6027660	6033740	that to be done before they open theaters new theaters again you know because i guess the whole
6033740	6038860	like a simulcast deal has been hurting some of the box office intake ask ask garland johanson
6038860	6048460	what she thinks of that and that whole thing so yeah yeah all right anyhow uh let's go ahead and
6048460	6052940	travel around and check out some rapid fire news and quickly check out some other things going on
6052940	6058700	in the industry we'll start with loki so curveball space program has officially announced that they're
6058700	6064380	ceasing um development on the first game which i guess makes sense because they're putting out
6064380	6069340	curveball space program too so it would have had to have stopped at some point but keep in mind
6069340	6074540	though they've been developing the game for 10 years so a long time you know i i think that
6074540	6081260	they're allowed to do that the last update uh was just released on august 3rd um and that was
6082220	6090540	the one point 112.2 update which fixed over 90 bugs in the game so yeah i guess it's fine that
6090540	6096140	they've stopped development on that since they got to move on at some point um and apparently
6096140	6102060	pac-man 99 has been doing well uh despite the fact that it's not you know the the mario game
6102060	6108380	and that has surpassed four million downloads on the nintendo switch um i attribute that to
6108700	6113500	the lack of things that they're putting out as part of that nintendo online since we're not
6113500	6118540	getting a lot of new games but you know hey people like their battle royale games and that's kind of
6118540	6125100	cool um is this going to be a temporary game as well because like i don't know they haven't really
6125100	6129100	said i don't know i don't think they undated it i don't think i just want still around right tetris
6129100	6133420	one's still around and uh it was just that mario one for whatever reason they put an expiration
6133420	6141900	date on it that's so stupid i don't get it it's just dumb um all right uh is dark soccer there
6141900	6146220	as she turned off her cam so she might yeah she might have gone afk for a second so um i'll do
6146220	6151740	a quick aside before we get to her story since she brought up pac-man um uh alan was just at costco
6151740	6156620	like just now today like before the show and he said you're laughing because you know where this
6156620	6161020	is going right were you know where this is going no i haven't been in costco but i already there's
6161100	6166780	only one possible outcome because i could just be so he sent me this picture on our chat app that we
6166780	6175660	use um oftentimes um that he saw at costco for i'm sorry i'm looking at the price here 369
6176780	6181740	he found this i'm holding up my phone like you guys can see it he found this arcade one up machine
6182300	6189500	that is super pac-man now i gotta say i love the fact that it's branded super pac-man because a
6189500	6194540	lot of times these things are reskinned as oh hey alan funny you should walk in here this
6194540	6198540	i'm talking about what you saw at costco here do you want to do you want to are you camera
6198540	6202780	safe do you want to talk about no he showed he didn't want to come on and talk about it
6202780	6208300	but he sent me a picture of it and he was like you know kind of not word for word but was kind
6208300	6213820	of like you know you want it type of thing basically and i here here was my response my
6213820	6219340	response says the minute we put the money down to buy that cabinet that's when the
6219340	6226060	tron pre-orders are going to go up and we're going to be pissed so i i actually said no
6226860	6231660	you saw that they finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game right yes i did see they
6231660	6237340	finally announced the stupid simpsons arcade game i don't know why they waited so long but like i
6237340	6242140	don't either yeah um so the here's the thing and then we'll get back i see dark soccer's back so
6242140	6246460	we'll get to her rapid fire stories as soon as i wrap up the story um the on the arcade one-up
6246460	6251820	machine uh with the super pac-man i did again i love that it's super pac-man branding which maybe
6251820	6260700	jamie wants to hear this i don't know uh sure at costco a 369 super pac-man branded arcade one-up
6260700	6268460	with super pac-man pac-man pac-mania galaga galaxian dig dug and pac-land so it's seven games
6268460	6273580	and those are like honestly i love me some super pac-man i like pac-mania i like pac-land i love
6273580	6282140	dig dug so that's a pretty solid cabinet the only problem is if i i there's another cabinet they put
6282140	6288300	out not recently that's not excuse me a little bit recently that's not at costco and it's the namco
6288300	6295820	legacy machine and that machine has all of the same games but it's 4 49 it's it's almost like
6295820	6304300	80 more than costco but it's pac-man pac-land pac-man plus super pac-man pac and pal pac-mania
6304300	6314220	galaxian galaga dig dug dig dug two mapi which is huge and rompers are in that machine so yeah i'm
6314220	6319020	like oh the dig dug two even though that wasn't quite as good as the original uh because it's
6319020	6325100	very different and um the uh mapi really make that cabinet but i love the fact that this one is is
6325100	6329900	branded super pac-man now to answer the question in chat where somebody said why not somebody
6329900	6338300	said why not both uh w04 said porque no los dos um the tron cabinet and the super pac-man eventually
6338940	6343900	um some things are in the works that i haven't talked about yet um but i will very soon i promise
6344460	6350380	and we'll be able to have a little more um space around where we live to have some more cabinets
6350460	6357580	because we're making some changes um but right now i could i could squeeze in one more
6359260	6364380	but you know again like i said the minute i buy the super pac-man cabinet that tron cabinet's
6364380	6369260	gonna come out and then i'll be pissed because i won't have any space for the tron cabinet
6369260	6374780	so bobby blackwolf in chat says wait for tron that's the plan because here's my thought tron
6374780	6378700	could end up being a limited thing like maybe the burger time thing was and i don't know if
6378700	6383820	i'll be able to get it forever pac-man you're gonna be able to get pac-man forever and it's
6383820	6388300	not even so much pac-man as it is super pac-man for me but those games are always going to go
6388300	6393340	hand in hand if there's a pac-man cabinet it's gonna have pac-man ms pac-man pack of
6394460	6400940	pac-land it's gonna have the various pac-man games in it for sure so i will wait all right
6400940	6406540	anyhow i won't wait any more to get some more rapid fire news dark sakura now that song is in
6406540	6411900	my head i can't wait my new shoes oh i thought you were gonna the dawson's creek song no
6412860	6420860	um first of all no second of all i hate that song and third of all no and number four i hate that
6420860	6431580	show so getting into some actually interesting stuff um there uh there's another mario game
6431580	6437580	that has come out and sold for a shitload of money there is an unopened copy of super mario
6437580	6448220	brothers again that um sold for 2 million um that topped the 1.56 million uh for a super mario 64
6448860	6458140	this particular one by the wata scale is a 9.8 a plus rating which means it is in exceptional
6458140	6469260	condition and cool i just i just don't understand what you know i i get that this is a very specific
6469260	6473100	pressing of the game so even if you have like a super mario brothers cartridge lying around
6473100	6478540	chances are this is not the two unless you again are extremely lucky and have you know lottery luck
6478540	6482620	it's not the one that's going for 2 million in fact these things going for 2 million have the
6482620	6489260	box instructions unopened but it's that very specific like sears tab top to the box it was
6489260	6499740	sold for a very limited time only at sears so silly all right and then um now space invader's
6499740	6506220	invincible collection is going to be on switch but it's gonna cost 60 bucks on august 17th
6507020	6513340	too much uh huh i said too much money yeah that's pretty much what i'm going with um
6513340	6521580	tito announced the collection um it is available for pre-order um but that that's quite a bit um
6522700	6531820	it has 11 different versions of space invaders from the original 1978 uh to uh 2018 space
6531820	6539100	invaders giga max 4se and has a free download of the 2017 mobile release arcanoid versus space
6539100	6550060	invaders um but i mean it is kind of niche you know yeah i'm with sterlock who says that's one
6550060	6554860	expensive tab the good news is these types of games tend to go on sale pretty quick so wait
6554860	6559500	for like you know around the black friday time of year and i bet you this comes way down in prize
6560460	6569020	yeah but i mean i i won't be spending it for that i mean if i was gonna get getting a physical copy
6569020	6577020	maybe yeah but no i think this is interesting the stuff that yyr is talking about is still talking
6577020	6580460	about that mario sale but i think this is interesting why we are in regards to the mario
6580460	6585100	cartridge sale says this is basically just one company trying to drive up the prices i wouldn't
6585420	6590460	be shocked if they sold it to themselves nothing about these last few weeks record-breaking mario
6590460	6595580	game sales is legit it did seem to come out of nowhere didn't it when i've always been led to
6595580	6600940	believe that stadium events is supposed to be like that must have nes game where did this freaking
6600940	6606780	like super mario brothers original box like 2 million cover i think stadium events was what
6606780	6612140	like maybe 700 000 last time we talked it's just it's just we it is weird that this is all all of
6612140	6618780	a sudden in it all right maybe i'm getting too much conspiracy theory but i think i think it
6618780	6623660	just the timing is strange somebody else has suggested it's like pandemic driven
6623660	6629500	collectible mania or something but i don't it's just weird all right what's not weird some new
6629500	6633020	video games to play this week let's travel around the world and check out some releases

6771820	6776620	the week i hate to keep going back to this but you y'all are falling down the rabbit hole in
6776620	6782140	chat and i love it um sha100 matt again about the collectible thing says there is a backlog with
6782140	6787500	collectible appraisals services where you ship your collectible for it to be graded due to the
6787500	6792860	pandemic because of that prices have shot up on things and see i would never really thought of
6792860	6797100	that but i didn't even realize that was the thing you could do but who would make who would mail in
6797100	6803420	a two million two million dollar video game but i guess i guess it's possible but i can't i get
6803420	6807500	but i also understand like that is like something that's driving everything up even if not this
6807500	6813740	particular piece of merchandise went through that process so um fascinating i guess i need to watch
6813740	6818940	more antiques road show because i have no idea how all this works when it comes to collectibles
6818940	6824220	so who knows what i have a lot of shit in my house and who knows if any of it's worth anything
6825180	6831900	maybe that's why i hang on to it all right let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we
6831900	6835900	get to the listener round table you may or may not have heard we are taking calls again so
6835900	6840540	we'll check in on the green green room a little closer to the um listener round table in a little
6840540	6847500	bit uh for now uh loki yeah so apparently we're hearing some more rumors about that
6847500	6853740	new playstation vr2 and this is coming from a leak from a sony developer conference and
6853820	6860700	apparently the leaker has been known to um have some reliable information so we'll go with that
6861340	6866460	and um you know some of the things we've kind of already heard about before you know with
6867180	6871660	you know the different uh you know field of view so like you know it's supposed to have
6871660	6876860	110 degree field of view uh 10 it says up from 10 degrees from what it was before
6877340	6886060	uh the resolution of 2000 by 2040 pixels per eye and apparently it's a little bit
6886060	6892940	that is a little bit better than say the oculus quest 2 and then um you know of course there's
6892940	6900060	going to be you know a oled display on there and um you know of course better lighting you know
6900060	6904540	color with that i want to hear more about the actual controllers but i don't think there's
6904540	6912140	anything in there about that um but yeah so lots more um a little bit more information
6912140	6917180	kind of piggybacking on some of the earlier rumors that we heard before but there's this
6917180	6925900	whole video out now uh by this uh p psvr without parole um a youtuber that has uh some of the
6925900	6931100	details about that so i don't know sounds interesting i'm excited they when they finally
6931100	6934780	announce all the information and kind of how that's gonna work with especially backwards
6934780	6940300	compatibility and stuff like that and whether there's a new you know uh until dawn rush from
6940300	6947500	blood or rush of blood game because that's really gonna sell it for me um but yeah next year i guess
6947500	6952380	we'll just have to wait until all those leaks come out hopefully you can walk into target and
6952380	6957100	get a fucking playstation 5 oh yeah yeah gonna have to have a playstation 5 to run that on too
6957100	6962540	i guess that's kind of important so um they can't figure out those chip shortages this vr is going
6962540	6970460	to meet the same fate so this is true yes but um yeah and i'm sure i'll use it so much more than my
6970460	6978700	current vr headset which has been in the box for a year or two i don't so i don't know well it just
6978700	6984220	depends it just depends if the games are there that's the most important thing so yeah all right
6984220	6988700	well one game i don't think we'll end up on psvr too because i think this is more of a microsoft
6988700	6995580	thing is pubg but did you guys hear the name of pubg has officially changed this week the new
6995580	7000860	acronym is pubgbg because the new game the new name of the game is pubg battlegrounds
7001500	7007100	now atm machine yes it is like atm machine okay because think about let's let's think about what
7007100	7013340	pubg meant player unknown battlegrounds so the name of the game is player unknown battlegrounds
7013340	7021420	battlegrounds that is yeah it's a game where that's like saying fight against each other
7022060	7027420	and and it's that's like saying atm machine yes exactly i just said that
7029420	7037100	i missed it so yes uh pubg battlegrounds here's why they're doing it so they want to expand the
7037100	7044300	pubg brand through new experiences set in the universe so calling pubg battlegrounds that is
7044300	7048380	going to be representative of the battleground game but there is a new game coming out called
7048380	7056380	pubg new state it's a mobile title with a futuristic setting uh it is uh um i guess the
7056380	7060460	creators of dead space made a game called the callisto protocol which is connected to this
7060460	7064620	oh yeah i remember seeing the trailer for that at one of the just call it the player unknown
7064700	7067100	universe or something like that like i mean pubg
7069900	7077020	i don't know the only way that they can really do this now is really lean into that like we need to
7077020	7083340	get you know you need to get someone saying yo dog i hear you like battlegrounds so we put
7083340	7087260	battlegrounds in your battlegrounds so you can battlegrounds why your battlegrounds you know
7087260	7092060	they need to really lean into that now uh bobby blackwolf also points out part of it is that
7092060	7095820	player unknown has left the industry so they don't really want to use his name anymore so
7095820	7102620	pubg has just kind of become a i guess you know perhaps you should have renamed your game a long
7102620	7106860	time ago well wait i have okay i have a great idea here because i was going to say here's
7106860	7110460	some even more exciting now if you want actually something to actually be excited about when it
7110460	7116620	comes to pubg bg here it is there's an official collaboration coming between pubg battlegrounds
7116620	7123660	and blackpink the korean pop band cool so yes uh you could it's a black there's a blackpink
7123660	7127500	collaboration bundle there's like a new parachute and there's some other stuff as well so in my
7127500	7132700	opinion why don't we just make this game blackpink battlegrounds because now there there's an

7173180	7177660	different types of events and stuff i mean i don't think blackpink is doing a concert

7233580	7240220	and it's a free update to our type final two like are they just like do they call them final the way
7240220	7245580	that graphic designers call their projects final or share it's never final or final
7245580	7250380	we all know that shara's had so much surgery she's practically immortal
7252140	7259660	um either that or she's just gonna have uh um chad michaels fill in for her for the rest of

7306860	7311420	valve uh orange right in chat says i played through our type final two good game
7311980	7315740	well now you'll have final three to play through as well exciting i love our type
7315740	7322700	but nothing is ever the first level music for the first our type um the hits keep coming in chat in
7322780	7330860	regards to the pub gb g story uh yyr in chat says you're listening to olr radio okay let's have a
7330860	7337580	chat do not refer to this show ever as olr radio um i don't want to speak for dark sakura but i
7337580	7341260	have a pretty good feeling that if you do call this show olr radio if you look in the mirror
7341260	7346300	and say olr radio three times dark sakura will reach out to the email and slap you silly so
7346380	7349100	don't do that am i right it will happen
7351980	7359900	um and then bobby blackwolf says rob roberts hey watch it so i hate to bring things down
7360460	7366940	but but i just found out that an actress i really like died oh the marquee post story yeah i love
7366940	7373660	night court okay no night court was great that is sad i had no idea she was um in in bad health but
7373660	7378540	i guess she had been battling cancer for a little bit because um yeah she was still acting for quite
7378540	7384620	some time she was uh the mom and something about mary yeah yeah so and she didn't she'd done other
7384620	7389340	stuff here and there so yeah i actually saw john larroquette's post about it i don't mean to bring
7389340	7394140	things down but oh my goodness no it's fine well it's also sad that like like we've lost several
7394140	7398780	people from night court just in the past few years it feels like harry anderson died in 2018
7398780	7405260	and charlie robinson died uh this year as well yeah yeah i i was like i thought we just lost
7405260	7410540	somebody else from that show not that long ago so anyway that's all right sometimes sometimes i
7410540	7414460	have a night court marathon sometimes the news breaks during the show i mean even though that
7414460	7417820	technically was overnight but that's right sometimes we don't find out about them until
7417820	7423660	we just hit that right tweet yeah all right um loki i feel like we alluded to this already in
7423660	7430220	the show but uh why don't you make it official yeah so apparently grand theft auto 5 is leaving
7430220	7439340	xbox game pass um you know it's not been on there for very long uh but yes there's gonna be some
7439340	7447020	other um games coming as well though um so like this at least the early part of this month we've
7447020	7453340	got a you know katamari democracy reroll as you mentioned uh skate and skate 3 were put on there
7453340	7461900	as well uh this week art of rally and of course hades and then the stuff leaving um aside from
7461900	7471820	grand theft auto we have uh dark siders genesis final fantasy 7 and uh don't starve and train
7471820	7478540	sim world 2020 so yeah a lot of games leaving but there's been they've gotten a lot of like
7478540	7482860	i just said like luminous and uh katamari were added recently so let's be honest if
7482860	7487580	you haven't played grand theft auto 5 in the 10 years it's been out i mean like true
7488700	7494540	true okay it's not even i played a little bit of five finally it hasn't been out for 10 years
7494540	7501020	but it's been out close almost it's a long time it's almost eligible for classic game of the week
7501820	7505420	it is almost eligible for classic game of the week and we don't even have grand theft auto 6
7505420	7513660	yet so what is going on all right sorry games well um a game that absolutely should be and by
7513660	7518060	the way if you want to call into olr we're almost to that point of the show so um headed to the
7518060	7522300	green room if you want to call into olr i see somebody in the public chat but i'm not sure if
7522300	7525500	that is just left over because that was the same person that called in a bobby show so i'm not sure
7525500	7529100	if that's where they just kind of ended up after the show but head over to the green room if you
7529100	7536620	want to be in be in tonight's olr um while i get while we wait for that uh heading to this story
7536620	7539740	which now this is a classic game i'm almost positive this had to have been the classic
7539740	7545660	game of the week at some point if not dark cycle we need to remedy that at some point but um this
7545660	7549420	game is absolutely something that's worthy of a classic and one that i wish would come back and
7549420	7555500	i'm talking about marvel versus capcom 2 uh is a game that a lot of fans this week have just like
7555500	7562540	it seems like it's a very viral thing on twitter oh it has been now uh episode 789 according to
7562540	7568540	our wiki whenever that was wow i'm not gonna say it's because of our show but i mean i did have it
7568540	7572300	as my background video a couple weeks ago so i just you know want to take full credit for that
7572300	7577900	and and everybody look at tonight's look gonna take you for a ride look at tonight's episode
7577900	7586780	number 879 and dark soccer just said this was the classic game on 789 is that a coincidence
7587900	7595740	there are no coincidences anyway marvel versus capcom was 388 well for some reason the credit
7595740	7602060	for this particular uh recent charge to get this game re-released is a content creator maximilian
7602060	7608220	dude um i i don't know the name myself but they must be more popular than us um they began a
7608220	7614620	hashtag campaign called free mbc2 which apparently got a lot more steam than president kat did
7614620	7618300	but um sorry one sec guys i just had an earpiece fall out
7621980	7628220	okay that was extremely graceful all right um so this style he's grace
7628460	7633180	he'll drop his earbuds in your face again and i'm just sitting here lamenting how are there
7633180	7638300	all these people more popular than us while i'm a big klutz we'll have on air all right
7638300	7644060	uh there's a free mbc2 hashtag to try to get support among folks who want to see this crossover
7644060	7650780	head out now this these types of uh uh campaigns happen once in a while what makes this notable
7651340	7655180	a similar thing to what made the president cat thing notable back in the day and that is the
7655180	7659740	developer responded remember that remember when the developer responded to us during the president
7659740	7663900	cat thing and i'm sure they were like what the fuck but that's not what they said i'm not a
7663900	7669820	famous capcom responding so that's fine yes uh so in this case the studio head of digital eclipse
7669820	7676780	mike mika actually said on twitter we made what i think was the last mbc2 release on console when
7676780	7684620	we were known as backbone um let's see uh 16 by 9 and so forth i love the outpouring we'd swap
7684620	7690860	in ggpo and do documentary and museum work we'd need to talk to disney and capcom to make it real
7690860	7696860	we're game if they are hashtag free mbc2 and oh yeah disney is a player now because disney owns
7696860	7704060	marvel so that would be very interesting um so yeah um and of course folks note that digital
7704060	7708220	eclipse has worked a lot with this type of stuff they did the street fighter 30th anniversary
7708220	7712780	collection they also did they also have worked with disney the disney afternoon collection
7713740	7721180	and so forth um there was a playstation 3 and xbox 360 port of marvel vs capcom 2
7721180	7726300	and that was pulled from online stores in 2013 because of the license that expired for the
7726300	7732380	comic book characters so um yeah it'll be interesting to see if this can actually happen
7732380	7738940	though i would love that i could i can stand behind this that's for sure but some folks are
7739020	7742860	saying you know again we don't you know if you could re-release it we don't have to shell out
7742860	7748300	a hundred dollars for a copy you know that was on the dreamcast or whatever or pirate it which
7748300	7754860	is what a lot of people are doing i think at this point so interesting uh dr tsuya says ggpo is the
7754860	7760220	online thing i believe some of capcom's older re-releases use it like i think dnd did yeah
7760220	7764780	they're probably talking about updating some of that online stuff so yeah i would i would love
7764780	7769180	that uh and quest buster filling me in because i'm very uncool and i don't know all the content
7769180	7773820	creators telling me that maximillian dude is a massive fighting game aficionado and he breaks
7773820	7778140	down info to make it appealing to people that may have never played a fighting game before all right
7778140	7784940	well prop props to him he this this crossed our desk so um and you know obviously we don't catch
7784940	7793180	everything so um congrats that's great uh dj rama s says i prefer capcom versus snk 2 over marvel
7793180	7800140	versus capcom 2 to which i say why not both everyone's entitled to a wrong opinion why not
7800140	7807580	both let's have both in one release i think that would be great all right anyway i just i you know
7807580	7811980	i don't even get you know talk about talking on fighting games to a level of people that don't
7811980	7817260	usually get into fighting games i don't get into fighting games a lot but that is one that i love
7817260	7822540	and i would instantly buy if it was re-released and you know not buggy or things like that so
7822620	7828460	that's that's for sure uh some folks in chat uh bobby blackwell says tatsunoko versus capcom
7828460	7835420	well that'd be pretty cool um and dj rama s says rival schools hell yeah to that now we need
7836140	7842380	shooting to justice die got going as in the college years all right we're gonna go to the
7842380	7848140	listener round table and we're gonna take some calls here on orange lounge radio uh we just
7848140	7851980	recently brought this feature back and so it's still a little bit of an experiment in progress
7851980	7856300	but if you want to give us a call head on over to the green room keep in mind i could pull you
7856300	7861500	in here at any time so just be ready for that that's the one thing uh i've lost from before
7861500	7865420	is the ability for people to hear when i've picked up the line and then acknowledge them they can't
7865420	7869660	hear that anymore they're just boop they're on air so we'll see how that goes and we're gonna take
7869660	7875740	this call right now and see how it goes um hello you are on orange launch radio who's this
7876700	7880140	hey there's that hey act f it is great to see you how are you
7882380	7889180	i'm doing pretty good um i just like some some of the things uh we're probably gonna talk about
7889180	7896220	but yeah i'm thinking what's on your mind tonight um well basically i do want to talk about uh the
7896220	7900540	niantic and pokemon go pull out all right have a great week we'll see you next time no i'm just
7900620	7905660	kidding what what is your you you love pokemon go you play it a lot what's your take on this
7905660	7915740	whole thing uh yeah basically as you'll probably know i i do like a lot of what is pokemon and
7915740	7923180	especially pokemon go i talk about it oh probably probably for every week uh if you see me on
7923260	7929820	twitter i post a lot about it uh either getting chinese getting like perfect id
7929820	7934460	pokemon playing go battle league me ugly begging you to join a remote raid
7936540	7944220	sometimes yeah or open gifts stuff like that but yeah uh but basically i just want to
7945340	7952780	add a little bit to at least a little bit little bit more of context to what's happening right now
7953340	7959580	yeah well yeah and obviously you all take all talked about uh the covid bonuses and all that
7960140	7966780	uh and especially the distance thing which it is it actually it is actually really useful
7966780	7971740	and like dark sakura mentioned uh too it's it helps a lot of disabled people
7972380	7978220	uh i i personally know some of the uh in the community that actually benefited but because
7978220	7983820	of that because they are disabled or they don't they don't have like easy access to some of the
7983820	7991180	polka stops so it actually helps them and at the end of the day it helps us all but aside that
7992060	7998220	aside that it's pretty much in you've already said it it's the handling of all the things it's like
7999100	8006380	yeah they responded they said they're they're they're listening or they're hearing us but at
8006380	8014940	the same time the next day when the part uh part two of the ultra unlock starts and right now you
8014940	8023260	can get a heracross from from raids it's just a regional it's a regional that it's all available
8023260	8029980	in some places of florida and most of latin america not where i live because i live to way
8029980	8035660	to up north of mexico but but still it's like okay it should be available in the wild it should
8035660	8042620	be uh for those who live in those regions it should be accessible for them and what did
8042620	8049340	diane take went and do they took out the wild spawn of heracross they took out they took it
8049340	8055180	out pretty much of out of the game and the only way you can get anywhere what is a heracross
8055180	8062220	it's only through raids you only get one one raid per day one at least one free pass
8062780	8070380	per day and you have to go to the gym uh so for anyone that oh yeah i live in central mexico i
8070380	8077260	live in south america whatever oh i can uh a lot of people were excited they're excited because
8077260	8086460	oh we're gonna we're gonna get a regional shine and niantic doing that and especially after what
8086460	8094220	they did the day before is what is driven most people like really really out of the game and
8094220	8103020	the point of all this is communication if niantic where to communicate better what their what their
8103020	8110780	plans are if they actually like consider what the community wants and likes about the game
8111500	8119500	we wouldn't have these problems it's like and and and i was one to defend niantic in the past and
8120060	8127500	and there's evidence of that too i'm not gonna i'm gonna like hide it but it got to the point
8127500	8136380	and especially this week that um that niantic is pretty much like at least they're showing us that
8136380	8141820	they don't care they don't care about us they don't care about the player base the only they
8141820	8148620	are they are only caring about getting the map you know in in my case yeah i'm gonna play the
8148620	8154780	game because like i said the game is about the community the game is about us that we made the
8154860	8165020	game basically but i'm not gonna spend any money on it like i don't no no no remote passes no
8165020	8172700	premium passes no incense nothing that is gonna come from my pocket if i get if i get like poke
8172700	8179180	coins that stuff it's gonna come from the gyms if i remember to do so you know but i was just
8179180	8182380	saying sorry but i'm glad you brought up the hair cross thing because you're right i'd forgotten
8182380	8185580	about that and part of that is probably just because i'm spoiled because i don't live in that
8185580	8190540	area where the hair across usually spawned so i forgot that this was the thing now if i remember
8190540	8195740	right niantic and again i and and let me finish my thought here because uh i i do think niantic
8195740	8200860	made a boo-boo on this but if i remember right there was a tech issue where if they had kept
8200860	8205500	niantic uh or if they kept hair across in the wild it would have that same shiny rate that
8205500	8210620	was increased for the gyms so i think they increase it to like one in 64 in the gyms ends
8210620	8214460	up being a shiny and if they did that in the wild it would put too many of the shiny hair
8214460	8218940	crosses or whatever in the wild and so i think they're going to put it back after the gyms are
8218940	8223660	done but it would be at that normal shiny rate of like one in 512 or something like that now
8223660	8229900	that all being said and i've explained the the system limitation uh there's a very common line
8229900	8234700	we've started to use on this show a lot in fact it's not maybe the golden rule of gaming where
8234700	8239180	a system is only as good as the games that are on it but maybe it's the the silver rule of gaming
8239180	8245100	culture and that is it's not the facts it's what's perceived and the fact is if the tech
8245100	8250060	system is broken niantic and the tech system is preventing you from having the thing in spawn in
8250060	8255260	raids at the same time it's in the then fix the fucking tech that's the problem because what's
8255260	8262540	being perceived by folks like mike deft and many people around is is just that you're being shit
8262540	8268460	greedy is is what's happening and so the tech side of that badly needs to be fixed quite
8268460	8274140	honestly um can i tell you a weird anecdote though and it honestly has nothing to do with
8274140	8279900	this but it was weird to me so you know that before all this covid shit started i was i was
8279900	8285340	in that part of the world right i went to miami to take a cruise to some of the caribbean which is in
8285340	8291180	that same you know uh a latitude area that like the parts of mexico where hair across spawns in
8291180	8298540	is and i caught lots of regionals i caught corsola i caught the um cactus thing that is
8298540	8304060	in that area in florida as well maractus yeah well maractus was the big one because that's
8304060	8309420	that was the one that when i brought back like all the big pokemon players were in this area were
8309420	8313900	like can i please trade you for a miraculous because that's the one you couldn't get anywhere
8313900	8319020	else um and then uh and they're all gone now that's the one pokemon like all of them went
8319020	8324380	that i caught anyway carne vine that's the one i was trying to think of that part of the world
8324380	8329340	so i got all this i didn't catch a single hair across that entire time just a weird a weird
8329340	8334140	antidote that has nothing to do with this but it so when i was hearing about this i was like well
8334140	8338220	hair across didn't fucking spawn anyway like because i was like i didn't catch them when i
8338220	8343980	was down there but apparently that is very much just like apparently they spawn everywhere and
8343980	8348460	it might just depend on the time like maybe i just was there at a weird time the only way i had a
8348460	8353580	hair across was from our pal jd because he was playing pokemon go at the time and he went to
8353580	8357500	florida on a family trip and he caught one and traded it to me so i had a hair across before
8357500	8362700	this but now i'm like well i want a pink one but yeah of course i'm not i'm not affected by the
8362700	8370700	whole um it but but another pokemon that spawns in raid right now is kangaskhan right and i'm
8370700	8375500	hearing that australia which is the new zealand which is the region or no does new zealand have
8375500	8381180	or they have just relicanth right they they i i think they have kangaskhan on new zealand too
8381180	8388380	and obviously australia it's like the oceania oceania but either way i'm hearing that they did
8388380	8395500	not pull the kangaskhan wild spawns in australia so that is just again just a weird fucking
8395500	8401820	perception too like okay but the kangaskhan are just gonna be everywhere in shiny but the hair
8401820	8409420	across can't so i i mean i get it i get why people are like dude you guys suck and and that's not
8409420	8415740	not only that there's precedent of them unlocking regional shinies before and keep it done in the
8415740	8425180	wild so it's like it's it's not necessarily that they need to boost or they they want to keep it
8425180	8433180	like fair quote-unquote for everyone it's no it's it's like there's nothing that should
8433180	8441900	uh prevent them or like stop them to to release in the wild because again there's
8441900	8449740	already a precedent we already have like taro's as you said kangaskhan barfetch and mr mine which
8449740	8456140	are regionals uh on someplace of the world and when those were really shiny though they were
8456140	8461900	still spawning on the wild i i actually remember getting a wild taurus during that event in
8461900	8468300	particular and getting the shiny because it wasn't the wild it was not only in eggs it was in the
8468300	8475820	wild and it was i think full on it's what it was for once so even like something like hair across
8475820	8480380	and i i understand what you're saying it's like understandable but at the same time
8480380	8487340	they didn't that before they didn't do that before yeah so doing this right now it's like baffling
8487340	8493500	and so many people are actually angry they're they're not putting anything in the game some
8493500	8499100	up some many have happened too well but again it yeah it's i was just to say it is it is
8499100	8505820	interesting sometimes to see where the player base will break and say you know what and i'm
8505820	8510940	talking in mass where the player brace bait breaks off and says you know what fuck this i'm out
8510940	8517020	because another game i'm thinking of that recently had this happen is world of warcraft and this is
8517020	8521580	this was happening before any of the activision blizzard stuff for the past few weeks so let's
8521580	8527580	try try to now as i'm saying this not that that is not part of that it is now for some people
8527580	8532220	certainly but at the time people were still breaking off of world of warcraft in mass and it
8532220	8536940	it seemed like it just seemed like the weirdest to from me who broke off world of warcraft eight
8536940	8541980	years ago i was like now you're leaving world of warcraft like because they did something with
8541980	8547980	sylvanas that was like i'm like the it's the story of the last few expansions has been pretty mad
8547980	8554860	this is just weird that like now you're leaving okay but um now it's like with pokemon go it's
8554860	8561180	like hair across that's the thing that sets you off okay interesting but i'm just i'm i don't i
8561180	8565740	don't mean that in a negative or condescending way it's just it's interesting to me what sets
8565740	8572140	off the player base in mass sometimes i think uh not only the hair across thing but it's like
8572140	8579740	the snowball getting bigger and bigger and again coming this coming after niantics like
8579740	8588140	like like really really bad response i i don't want to go way further into my words but it was
8588140	8594940	a really bad response and even i and when when they put out the response they posted it i was
8594940	8600540	at least they responded they did something better than nothing but after seeing the hair across thing
8600540	8609420	is like yeah i cannot justify them anymore it's like i'm done with them but again it's like
8609980	8617100	and and i was talking earlier this on my own um gff cast uh that i do not feel the like the
8617100	8623500	tinesing fallacy or whatever it's called because i have so many good memories of the game and
8623500	8630140	i have met so many awesome people through pokemon go it's like i have i have found so many communities
8630140	8635580	even like in on twitch it's like there's so many good stuff i have from the game that i have
8636140	8641740	uh gotten from it it doesn't necessarily in the game so yeah i was i'll still play pokemon go
8642540	8649260	i'll do like again go battle league i'll do raids whenever i can when when i do have like free
8649260	8657020	passes all that stuff but again i'm i'm not like really in the mood to put any money into it like
8657020	8664060	like uh sj 100 mad saying like uh the the community days the one dollar thing it's like
8664060	8670300	yeah i'm not gonna buy that i always buy it even if it sucks but now it's like i'm not gonna buy it
8670300	8678460	at all yeah so yeah it's like um and it's so it's like it's like it's a really easy fix it's not
8678460	8683980	they're not necessarily talking about the game it's like gigantic just communicating to us like
8683980	8688460	being a little bit more transparent if they're like expect and again that's returning to the
8688460	8695020	heracross thing if they had said oh heracross is only gonna appear in raids at least we would know
8695020	8702060	it's like okay we we understand okay it's whatever we'll wait if if we want if we are in the region
8702060	8709020	and all that stuff but like being so secretive for something like that it's like no no this
8709020	8714060	that's not how we play let me ask this question before we wrap it all up because um we're gonna
8714060	8719180	play the hypothetical world where um and i love this hypothetical world because the hypothetical
8719180	8724540	world where rob is right so let's play in this hypothetical world where rob is right that uh
8724540	8730860	what i said ends up happening the the 80 meters comes back but you're gonna burn out pokey stops
8730860	8735420	after four spins for a four hour period i don't know something like that so let's say they kind
8735420	8741980	of do like a halfway type of uh thing is that gonna bring you back into the fold or have we
8742060	8743740	gone past the point of no return at this point
8747900	8755740	it's like even if they actually do a radius thing like like even like if you say it's like it's
8755740	8761020	going to be done like oh a burnout after first things like they do in english it's like it's
8761020	8767100	the same on english if they do that the same as ingress it's like okay it's a compromise
8767820	8773980	but we i still need to see more from them it's like we still have so many problems in the game
8774780	8783020	uh and and like again go battle league the lag the the bugs all that stuff it's like still present
8783020	8791820	in the game yeah uh so many many stuff in terms of uh of cash grabbing like the raids like the eggs
8792700	8802620	there's so many things that need to be addressed at least that until they do that i will i will
8802620	8809260	invest in the game of fair but until then yeah that's that's like no go even if they do that
8809260	8815740	it's like no we have to at least keep a little bit of pressure into address at least them addressing
8815740	8820540	all that you know what's really interesting and i i totally forgot to bring this up during my gaming
8820540	8825340	week but i'll bring it up now on wednesday night i actually went to an ingress meetup and it was
8825340	8829580	an official ingress meetup because you know there's a whole kind of separate team and group
8829580	8833740	that's working on that and maybe you've even heard of this uh deafness some of it's probably you know
8833740	8837580	crosses over and some stuff like oh well look what they're doing over on this side they have
8837580	8842860	that whole van tour or the xm detection van which is the whole thing of the ingress lore so they
8842860	8846940	have this van traveling around right now it was just in portland yesterday and i think it's in
8846940	8852860	boise on tuesday and it was just here in sac on uh wednesday so i actually went downtown and it
8852860	8856540	was there was about 75 people there because you know ingress doesn't have quite the fan base that
8856540	8861660	pokemon go does but it has its own loyal fan base right and um you know they they did their welcome
8861660	8865020	and everything it was and part of i think why they're doing this is they're actually kind of
8865020	8871180	introducing like their new community manager for like ingress at niantic who's done um a good job
8871180	8875180	so far i would say she had a really nice write-up about the event and she was really like engaging
8875180	8879340	with people and you know so forth i thought she did a very good job with the event overall
8879340	8882780	but i thought what was interesting is that when she was being introduced by the other guy
8882780	8887980	he was like you know and uh you know let her know all your feedback that you have on ingress and
8887980	8892300	you know all the other niantic stuff too if you have feedback on pokemon go or harry and you could
8892300	8898380	just see her eyes kind of went like like shut up shut up don't no no i don't want to talk about
8898380	8908380	the game because that was well it was she was at least uh but she uh i quit on friday yeah but
8909180	8913980	the community matter for pokemon go actually quit yeah i heard that not the same person just to be
8913980	8918860	clear but yes i heard that whole thing as well it's very interesting but i just a funny anecdote
8918860	8923420	your story kind of or your your comment reminded me to tell about the whole like taking feedback
8923420	8926620	like she's still kind of like you know smiling like sure i'll hear what you have to say because
8926620	8932300	luckily it's only 75 people and most of them care primarily about ingress right but there's
8932300	8936860	there's a hell of a lot of overlap there were plenty of people wearing pokemon go shirts
8936860	8941740	and i certainly have my little pokeball because we do what i call dual wielding we're playing
8941740	8945820	ingress on our phone and we're bluetooth catching on the pokeball we're dual wielding the games so
8945820	8950700	there's a lot of us that do play both so it's just uh i thought that i thought that was interesting
8950700	8956140	how she she kind of was like i i've opened because that was the same day as that letter
8956140	8959420	i think so i think she was very much like i want to talk about it i want to talk about it
8960620	8964940	i'm not i don't have my bullet points they probably knew if it was wednesday and the on the
8965660	8972780	letter thing was thursday they oh they probably knew because the letter was made by influencers
8972780	8978300	who worked with niantic on pokemon go anyway it was brewing it was brewing it was definitely like
8978300	8984940	you knew like people were pissed so anyway uh mike deft uh the rebranded act f mike deaf thank
8984940	8989340	you thank you so much for uh calling in tonight i do want to see if we can get to some other calls
8989340	8993340	but um thank you so much uh if you speak spanish you really owe it to yourself to check out the

9015260	9020540	i tried to drag deft out of the chat and i ended up dragging the studio out of the chat
9021660	9027980	oh whoops for the record rob we don't have any emails oh yes i was gonna acknowledge there are
9027980	9031820	no emails tonight um because you mentioned that before the show participate at orange
9031820	9035820	launch radio.com if you'd like to send us an email please let's uh let's have some of those
9035820	9039500	new future week all right that's okay we're still working the bugs out here as we're getting back
9039500	9044060	into taking phone calls here on olr but we do have another person on the line i'd like to get to it
9044060	9050220	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's sterlock hey sterlock it is good to hear from you
9050220	9054380	so i have a funny feeling because i know you called into bobby's show tonight i have a feeling
9054380	9059820	we might hear a similar topic but that's that's okay yes that's okay this is this is a good thing
9059820	9063900	for people to know about so tell us uh what's what what would you like to talk about tonight
9064540	9067260	so uh it all started with some reddit thread um
9070060	9083420	a couple weeks ago i posted a thread on reddit uh asking if uh you know hearthstone could be
9083420	9090540	modded to be accessible and i got just quite a bit of sorry i don't mean to cut you off but i
9090540	9094300	want to make sure our listeners who don't already know know because you've called into the show
9094300	9099500	before but admittedly in this covet age we haven't been taking a lot of phone calls for a bit so um i
9099500	9104220	just want to make sure those that don't know know that you are a blind gamer and you've often called
9104220	9109260	into the show kind of talking about um games that have like awesome accessibility things like the
9109260	9114380	last of us part two and um you know so forth and games are not so great accessibility because i
9114380	9119260	think these are good things for us to sort of keep in mind is that hey there's lots of people
9119260	9124380	out there that would like to play games but sometimes can't and so this is with you and
9124380	9128380	hearthstone so sorry i just want to make sure people have that background yeah yeah yep no
9128380	9135820	problem um and you know the the thread got quite a bit of traction and a lot of people are like oh
9135820	9141740	that would actually be really cool and then you know there were some people that were interested
9141740	9146140	and and you know thoughtful and but there are a lot of people were just like i don't know how this
9146140	9153180	could be done and some people were even like well this might be against blizzard tos you know to add
9153180	9162940	keyboard support um i can tell you that that's not going to be a concern um for reasons i'll get into
9162940	9172460	later but um so that you know i that thread goes on for like a day day and a half and kind of
9172460	9181100	fizzles out because you know reddit um and i didn't really you know think anything of it
9181100	9188860	it's like yeah you know it would have been cool if something came of it um but then i got a couple
9189420	9196940	that someone a couple people added me on reddit like look at this and uh turns out somebody had
9196940	9204780	already been working behind the scenes in secret for i guess months like completely independent of
9204780	9215900	my thread to make hearthstone uh accessible to blind people nice and uh it's you know it's pretty
9215900	9223820	you know it's pretty basic right now i mean it's it works very very well like battling works
9223820	9231180	flawlessly um what is lacking currently is uh selecting other modes and deck editing
9231980	9236060	and things like that but uh he wants to keep working on it and
9238300	9244060	yeah so basically what this does is it interfaces with your screen reader and you have a lot of
9244060	9247260	keyboard shortcuts to get to various parts of the field
9250460	9255900	and uh sorry i think i interrupted you no you're fine you're fine i want to make sure you you get
9255900	9259820	your piece out because i think it's important for people to know like you know kind of like
9259820	9266140	how this makes the experience um accessible for you um yeah but one thing i want to kind of with
9266140	9270860	the with the terms of service and the tos that whole thing i think the last thing blizzard needs
9270860	9275580	right now is a case on their hands where they shut down a mod that is making a game more accessible
9275580	9280620	um that is not the pr story blizzard needs right now so like um this this this will be in the clear
9281580	9289980	yeah no absolutely yeah well plus plus um there is a known blizzard uh developer oh named nikki
9289980	9297100	crenshaw uh who frequents a friend of mine uh super blind man uh he's a blind streamer
9298060	9307420	uh he streamed this on on friday when it came out and she happened to tune in and uh saw this and
9307420	9312060	she was just over the moon and apparently she showed it around to the the office and people
9312060	9317820	are just oh my gosh this is insane so that that those are those now that's good because
9317820	9322540	especially if she was you know one person is one person but if she was showing other people in the
9322540	9328140	office now that's a conversation and that might lead to the whole well how did this guy do it
9328140	9332540	maybe we should do this and blizzard does have a track record and from having covered world
9332540	9337020	warcraft for years and years blizzard at least the old blizzard but i don't see why you know
9337020	9340620	there's a lot of great people at blizzard still there's still yeah really good people at blizzard
9340620	9345660	even if some of the execs are crappy people exactly um and that's why that's why i don't
9345660	9352460	feel bad about playing this and and supporting because there's also rumors that diablo 2 is
9352460	9358620	going to be accessible so you can absolutely do both but i was going to say yeah wow wow did have
9358620	9364300	that track record of if a mod was really popular they like deadly boss mods was like almost like
9364300	9369020	a must-have mod for raid boss encounters they ended up yeah they ended up like incorporating
9369020	9373980	some of that into the main game so they they do look at the mods out there and the stuff that's
9373980	9379980	really popular they do have a tendency to kind of so that could bode very well for this um but let
9379980	9385820	me we're hoping we're hoping we uh we're hoping that like they decide i don't know if they're
9385820	9391980	going to but it would be awesome if uh you know blizzard you know gets a hold of them like hey
9391980	9399180	let's uh let's talk let's talk about how this works um let me ask you this though before uh
9399180	9402860	you know because uh we do have to wrap things up here pretty soon but i want to make sure uh i get
9402860	9408060	your opinion you know accessibility issues aside now that you've had the chance to play hearthstone
9408060	9416620	how do you like hearthstone as a game so good it's so good i just unlocked uh all the classes
9417580	9424540	and uh still working on getting the initial levels you know up to 10 to get the core the core cards
9425420	9431740	and uh i actually played a couple online matches even though so you can't i'm not gonna get into
9431740	9437180	specifics but there's a way with your screen reader even though it's not supported in the mod
9437180	9443580	itself to get there accessibly there's a way to do it where you can get to um online matches so
9443580	9449820	i've actually played a few uh online matches and so i'm kind of working on clawing my way out of
9449820	9457660	apprentice which is the basically like the newbie ranks yeah um and you get more cards by by
9457660	9462620	completing that so you know if nothing else i hope blizzard doesn't just hear about that i'm
9462620	9467900	so happy it's accessible but i hope blizzard hears that enthusiasm when you said it's so good
9467900	9472380	i hope that is what's heard where it's like hey by implementing something like this officially
9472380	9476780	you can make a lot of people say what you just said about hearthstone and i think that that
9476780	9482380	should be the most exciting getting it is getting like it's spread around now like a lot of the
9482380	9489740	blind community is playing it and is super excited about it so um yeah i i'm looking
9489740	9494460	forward i'm looking forward to deck building and uh packet opening because those are things that
9494460	9502940	are not currently uh accessible yet but uh hopefully soon all right well sterlock i'm
9502940	9506940	gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you i appreciate the update and uh what's
9506940	9510700	going on there i think that's good stuff for people to know about and uh keep us posted on
9510700	9515500	future um efforts for more games um to get those sorts of features i'd love to hear your take on
9515500	9522540	it definitely all right take care of my friend yeah you too all right bye-bye all right and
9522540	9528220	with that i think we are uh going to oh if i can find the right shot there there we go uh we're
9528220	9532300	going to get into a few more segments here and then we're going to wrap up here uh let me get to
9532300	9535740	last minute stories loki i don't know if you have anything tonight but do you have any last minute
9535740	9542140	stories i did have one thing so there was a deal that happened this week between uh trade parker
9542140	9549020	and matt stone with viacom cvs regarding south park so they're gonna be bringing like 14 movies
9549580	9556700	um several seasons and a video game um in the works apparently so we're getting another south
9556700	9561660	park video game at some point so that's pretty awesome i'm not surprised those games have done
9561660	9568380	pretty well but i've it is interesting how is it that these animated series are on forever like
9569100	9575580	south simpsons has been on forever uh south park uh forever family guy feels like it's been on
9575580	9580060	forever uh futurama has got to be getting good is is that show still on i think that's getting
9580060	9585100	canceled oh has it oh i feel like i'm still seeing it all the time so okay all right but still i feel
9585100	9589260	like like wow there's a lot of animated shows that go on for a very long time but you know why this
9589260	9593900	one's interesting because when i first read it and you know insert whatever joke you want about
9593900	9597500	south park being relevant all this stuff look it's just i i just want to talk about the deal itself
9598460	9603740	the the whole fact that they they've commissioned 14 movies you know that whole thing is just a
9603740	9610620	workaround right because hbo max through comedy central has the right to south park or no no
9610620	9615260	because comedy central is part of viacom but hbo max or somehow has the deal for one way or another
9615260	9620780	this is paramount plus or viacom leveraging their arm to get content for paramount plus
9620780	9624620	so the shows are going to be on hbo max at least for a couple more years and now paramount plus
9624620	9628860	is getting its own original content as well that's the part i think is fascinating about the deal
9628860	9634300	how they kind of strong-armed their own content for paramount plus because yo drag race all-stars
9634300	9639500	season six is going to be over in a few more weeks whenever they finish their game within a game so
9640220	9645980	it's time for new original content i guess huh i guess yeah yeah for sure that's cool
9645980	9651260	yeah for sure um all right uh one other thing and yes thank you i'm glad you brought this up
9651260	9657020	uh as joe and her to matt because i saw your uh post in our discord about it over at vog network
9657020	9660620	dot com slash discord if you want to join our discord and chat with us throughout the week
9660620	9666060	um as joe and her matt says thoughts on the cookie clicker i said cookie clitter i almost did
9666060	9671980	cookie clicker remaster and yes that is they are remastering cookie clicker
9672620	9677900	and bringing it back i don't know how to feel about it i would rather see a clicker heroes
9677900	9681900	remaster because the sequel wasn't that good the sequel wasn't as good as the first one
9682940	9689660	so that's uh that's what it is pixel pakas just put rob in all caps i can't help it
9689820	9699820	rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob all right i can bring that back you know what's that
9700380	9706860	i could bring that back you could you could um let's see uh there was a car or there was a
9706860	9712060	question from no one special 77 earlier before we started in the phone calls here we go uh and i
9712060	9718140	thought this was worth addressing real quick here in the spirit of the flag this week i'll ask this
9718700	9725260	what's the weirdest game you personally have played and he didn't specify arcade so we've
9725260	9729180	been talking about the weird arcade games through dark soccer segment maybe the weird
9729180	9734300	console games that you've played what are some what's the weirdest console game you've played
9734300	9739500	well the weirdest game i've played in the arcade isn't all that weird but uh probably prop cycle
9740300	9745900	i love prop cycle i love it it's not it's not it's just an unusual game it's not like terrible
9745980	9751260	not bad it's just fun i'll go one step further and say the prop cycle adams family that's what
9751260	9756540	i was gonna say i was gonna say what the yeah the prop cycle adams family stop stealing a potential
9756540	9766700	idea well you said it first you stole it from me so they have a prop cycle ab family game like you
9766700	9773180	power you you have to run the prop cycle to power the machine isn't it like that oh that okay i
9773180	9776620	thought it was like an actual prop cycle game where you like fly around through like the adams
9776620	9781100	family house or something like that i was like that sounds really cool why haven't i seen that
9781100	9784540	but no that's that's different okay i'll talk about something not in the arcade you know what
9784540	9790220	was a weird game nintendo dogs that game was a little weird i mean it was cute i'm not saying
9790220	9794860	i'm not saying it wasn't cute i'm just saying it was happy petting sim and they didn't they didn't
9794860	9798940	really take it as far as they should have in my opinion i'm surprised we never really got a true
9798940	9803820	i know there was the nintendo dogs plus cats for the 3ds but i'm surprised we never got like a
9803820	9808620	proper switch sequel and we just had all the knockoff stuff instead you know what else was
9808620	9813740	connect the moles you know what are you not impressed by connect the moles here's another
9813740	9819260	weird game the cooking mama game that mined bitcoin that's a weird game although that wasn't
9819260	9824300	true but in in my brain my head canon is it was true cooking mama things like scribble knots
9824300	9830460	oh that's a good one scribble knots is good there's a lot of scribble knots games man there's
9830460	9837660	a all very strange oh magic pen gel that game yeah that legend at the apartment that loki and
9837660	9846300	i used to live in absolutely time to penis all right i mean and let's not even start about uh
9847180	9853900	nobi nobi boy which i played a lot of ribbon so no nobi nobi boy man i rock those shirts i have
9853900	9859420	two nobi nobi boy shirts and i wear rock those every day i agree with sturlock tulip was an
9859420	9865660	interesting game yeah it was also that dream simulator game that came out that i played very
