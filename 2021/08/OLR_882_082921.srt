1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,820
Gamescom's presentation has come and gone and I keep seeing comments about a resounding

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,800
meh, which I think is awfully ironic but maybe this is just my Aunt or Grandpa Simpson coming

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,160
out yet again. Meanwhile, I'll be over here waiting to play another horror game involving

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,920
a camera so I can ramp up my personal paranoia all over again. Horror games done right.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,840
This is one of many headlines you expected to hear and now it's time for your hosts Rob

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,800
Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to go into detail about this and the rest of the week's

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,680
gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,040
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,760
number 882 of our show for this August the 29th of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and let's

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,040
talk about video games. We're going to talk about some video games with my co-hosts. Say

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,760
hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
Hi. You're looking great. I love your new hair that you have.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh yeah, let me. Hold on, hold on. I have to do it.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,880
While you do it. Which folks can see if they... Yes, she's shaking out her hair. Sorry. Which

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,320
folks can see if they watch live over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network or VOG Network.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,520
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,680
But we know it's a podcast. We try not to rely too much on the visuals, but I had to

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,440
comment on DarkSakura's red lovely hair she's got going on there. So kudos.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,480
It's a gradient. Kudos to your barber, whoever they may be.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,720
Well, thank you. My, my, my friend Hillary is awesome. She does great work. She is worth

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,440
every penny I pay. But this was a long time coming. Cause you remember when I went black?

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,480
I do. Of course. Yeah. Well, we let it grow and we let it grow and

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,000
we let it grow just for the sake of being able to do a red to black gradient.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh, clever. Some advanced planning. I like that. We do.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,880
There are pictures of me blonde and y'all will never see them.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,760
We do have our live chat room that gives us some comments here. Pod Culture mentions Sassy

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,360
do. So, uh, yeah, I think, uh, I think, uh, this is a very clearly you could be in a shampoo

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,640
commercial if you wanted, but anyway, well, it's just expensive styling products.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,600
All right. Also say hello to tech master Loki with the short, short hair that, uh, isn't

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,320
gradient or styled, but that's okay. Hi lucky. It doesn't have to be too short. That's okay.

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,400
You don't have to hide yours under a hat. Like I do. Cause mine's, mine's a little out

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,680
of control right now. Cause, uh, it's about time to shave the hide yours either. I don't.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,800
And actually I've done a few shows here at OLR without a hat, but here's the thing, uh,

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,440
with dragon con coming up this week, I'm actually waiting until like the last minute to give

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,520
myself a fresh buzz and then I'll go out to, uh, dragon con.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Le Bald. So, uh, uh, those that, those that I will see there this year, you have that

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,760
to look forward to so under the hat, but I will still have plenty of hats at dragon con.

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Uh, Loki, what is the game playing behind you tonight on Twitch? You usually run a little

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,360
video game behind you there on the green screen. It's a shadow run on the SNES. Oh, it sure

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,520
is. It took me a minute to recognize it. And the minute you said it, I'm like, it sure

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,360
is shadow because my head's in the way. So you can't really see it. Yeah. Yeah. But I

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,000
can see enough now that I make out the character and there was a screen just before that. I

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,360
gotcha. That's a classic. That's a good one. Um, I was playing games today too. We will

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,240
get into our gaming weeks here after we do the kickoff topic, but I have to quickly mention

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,720
I ran into the studio not long before showtime. So I was a little better than I was expecting,

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,480
but I went to an ingress event this morning in San Francisco. So, uh, my buddy is that

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,320
who sometimes listens to the show who also plays the game. Uh, we got in a car here at

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,600
nine AM, drove out to San Francisco. We actually got there. Traffic, the traffic gods were

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,800
very good today. We parked at about 10 45, which is kind of unheard of for a trip to

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,720
San Francisco to only really actually be an hour and a half. And then, uh, we, we did

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,120
what's called a mission day, did a bunch of missions around there and they did this

53
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,840
thing called a van event where you like hack the van basically. Uh, and then we got in

54
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,600
the car and came back and, uh, the traffic gods were a little meaner on the way home,

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,840
but I still made pretty good time home. So, uh, hacking a van, isn't that like hot wiring?

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,700
I, I, something like that. It's hacking the planet. No, I, I, is it one of those free

57
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,720
candy vans that I've heard about? Yes. Except it ties into the lore of ingress, but I don't

58
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,680
play video games for lore. Well, that's not true. Sometimes I really get into the lore.

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,800
Like a lot of the final fantasy games, there's many video games where I'm just like, I don't

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,520
care about the lore. I just want to play the game. And ingress is one of them. So the,

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,680
the van is something about detecting XM. I don't know, it plays with the story somehow.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,000
So being able to, because it travels or it's a moving portal. So let me, let me, cause

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,800
I know hardly anyone plays ingress. So let me, um, let me give the analogy to Pokemon

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,600
go. Imagine if a Poke stop moved from city to city. That's, that's basically what the

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,960
van kind of is. Uh, which I guess actually the van has shown up as a temporary, uh, pokey

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,360
stop sometimes. Cause there are people will post it to Reddit going, what the hell is

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,840
this as a pokey stops. It's kind of funny. It's the government spying on you. It's fine.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,560
That's right. Take this Pikachu in return. Here's all your, where you take all your privacy,

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,800
which is, which is honestly true. Uh, all right. We're just going to Pikachu at your

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:40,680
network package. How would you like to buy all of these Pokemon products now? Let's get

71
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,920
into the gaming news of the week. We're going to start off with our kickoff topic tonight

72
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,560
that has to do a games com because there was a quite a bit of information that came out

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,600
of, came out of games com about what to expect at this coming year, uh, including X-Box did

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,920
their own event. And then we had the opening light, opening light, opening night live event

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,960
from Jeff Keeley, you know, who does the game awards and has done, you know, uh, did

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,240
that E3 summer game Fest. So I feel like he does three or four of these types of big to

77
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,360
do press conference. I keep calling press conferences, but they're really like media

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,760
events, media spectacles, um, every year. And I I'm going to get just right into it

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Loki cause I need the details because I saw the tweets. So opening night live, we talked

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,840
about this last week on OLR. We knew there was going to be a saints row reboot, uh, that

81
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,960
was going to be announced at this. It was, it was like way past rumor status to where

82
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,400
they were tweeting like teaser images and stuff. So they actually showed us a little

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,200
glimpse of what the next saints row game looks like. And saints row, I know is one of your

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,240
very favorite series, Loki, although you kind of, you kind of like the saints row two era

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
of the game.

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,560
Well, I still liked, I liked saints row. Okay. So like saints row as a game, let's just,

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,220
let's imagine. So they did announce the saints row reboot, which is just being so tell us

88
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,260
your thoughts, Loki on this reboot.

89
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm good. I'm getting there. Okay. So they have the reboot that they announced it's coming

90
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,480
out February 25th, um, next year and it takes place in this new city called Santo Aliso,

91
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,300
which is kind of like, think of like a Vegas type of thing. And so it's a little bit more

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,620
of like that kind of, uh, type of environment or maybe like, um, Arizona, new Mexico, that

93
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:32,100
type of thing. Um, and so they, they showed it off like, and here's, here's a good indicator

94
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,740
of how I thought it was. So I saw the trailer and to myself before I even knew it was saints

95
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,140
row, I'm like, I really hope this isn't saints row. I really hope this isn't saints row.

96
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,980
And then I saw, you know, I forget to call it. Um, I saw the purple, I saw the symbols

97
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,900
and like, Oh God, it's, it is saints row. Isn't it? So here's the problem. So saints

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,820
row had a really great cast of characters that really kind of drove this series. Like

99
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:13,240
I always talk about like Johnny Gat in the game, like very awesome character. Um, and

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,580
you know, even just like Julius and like all really characters, you know, given to life

101
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:27,860
by like really big name stars, these characters were as generic as possibly it could be like,

102
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,620
and this is granted, this is not a gameplay trailer they showed. This is like a cinematic

103
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,500
trailer, I guess. But even, but even like with cinematic trailers, like in the past

104
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,380
with like saints row three and stuff, it had been really awesome. Like just really like

105
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,260
nailing home. This is the vibe of the game. Like this is going to be really cool. All

106
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,620
this, the only vibe I got from this is like, this is the most generic game I've ever seen.

107
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,100
Can I jump to the punchline here, Loki though? And that you're going to buy it anyway though,

108
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,820
right? I we'll see, but here's the thing. Okay. We'll see. So like probably I will buy

109
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,020
it, but like, here's the, here's the problem. And like, and don't get me wrong. Like I'm

110
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:13,380
sure the game is a good game, but what they showed does not convey anything about the

111
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,780
series. So for example, like one of the things that the, the voice actress or the actress

112
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,780
that was in the, the presentation basically said, I'm the new boss in this game. Not exactly.

113
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,380
Okay. Cause they do still have the character customization. She's basically playing the

114
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,940
female voice actress for the role. They, they usually have a male role as well, but it wasn't

115
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,340
conveyed at all. So right there, like people thought immediately, Oh, so there's no customization

116
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,580
anymore. And just, you know, what's up with that. And then, you know, it wasn't conveyed

117
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,540
also with the co-op the like co-op in the game. So there's a whole lot of details that

118
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,240
they didn't really talk about in gameplay that they showed was just so minimal and yeah,

119
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,060
the game looks like saints row when you play it, but also they talking about like, Oh,

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,020
let's bring it back a little bit less ridiculous and more realistic. Oh, but there's going

121
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:14,520
to be flying motorcycles and VTOLs and stuff like that. That's just Saints Row 3 again,

122
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,360
they're making Saints Row 3 again, but except this time they've taken out all of the good

123
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,520
characters in the game and they have these like knockoffs. It's like, it's like if Epic

124
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,380
games were copying Saints Row for Fortnite and these are the characters that they came

125
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,020
out with. Like we have Kevin now who is like the new Johnny Gat basically kind of taking

126
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:41,480
on that role like this crazy, you know, Daredevil type of guy. You've got the, the Pierce stand

127
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,300
in with Dion. I think I don't remember his name, but who cares? It's like, it's basically

128
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,860
like the hot new game is coming from Nintendo. It's super Mark O brothers and it's coming

129
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,620
out and they're like, Oh, and then this person, they're the driver. It's like, but you're

130
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,220
playing the game as your care is the boss and you're driving the car. Like, why do I

131
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,940
need a driver? I don't need a driver. I'm like, who cares? Like it's just, I don't know.

132
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,940
It just really didn't sell me on it. Like if you want to sell me on it, like in you

133
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,860
bringing it back, like rebooting the franchise, here's my expectation was like, okay, reboot

134
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,580
the franchise, but like with the same cast of characters in there and just do something

135
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,740
different with it. Like for example, if I'm going to reboot Tomb Raider as they did, and

136
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,940
I didn't put Laura Croft in there, people would be throwing a fit about it. You know,

137
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,300
this game, this is, uh, this is Tomb Raider with Mary craft is actually, uh, the star

138
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,300
of this, uh, new Tomb Raider game. Or if it were, if it were, if I reboot, like, you know,

139
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,820
street fighter and I took out all of the characters that you liked in it, but it's still street

140
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,660
fighter. You're still actually, actually data East did that and called it fighting street.

141
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:03,460
That's a very famous court case. That is street. There's another thing about that because

142
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,180
that was actually a release of street fighter for turbo graphics, I think. Oh, right. But

143
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,900
wasn't that the whole, wasn't that the whole, is somebody completely ripped them out of

144
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,460
fighting? No. Yeah. That's art of fighting. No fighting street was the data East thing.

145
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,060
Anyway, allow me to history. Okay. That was it. Here's where I start to get concerned

146
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,460
and, and I'm going to, I have to find the quotes because the quote, okay, here's where

147
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I get concerned. So chief creative officer, Jim Boone was interviewed talking about saints

148
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,740
row and their, their inspiration for the game. Now, remember saints row was a game that was

149
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,860
basically gangsters. There was drug dealing. There was Robbie and convenience stores. There

150
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,200
was pimping. There was drug running. There was gun running, stealing cars, all the fun

151
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,540
things you look forward to video games. So here, here's the new saints row. It is broadly

152
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:07,260
a contemporary millennial power fantasy. These disinfected millennials turn to crime, for

153
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,460
instance, put food on their table, feel part of the community and pay off their student

154
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,980
loans. That is not saints row. I don't know. I don't know about you guys, but I've had

155
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,700
a few millennial power fantasies in my day.

156
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,380
I don't know. I would, I would have turned to, to crime to pay off my student loans.

157
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
They were pretty expensive.

158
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,640
It is not saints for growth. Like this is just ridiculous. And the characters that they

159
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,540
show, I swear to God, it's like, it's like clout chasing, Tik TOK fantasy game. I mean,

160
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,200
that's what it is. It's just, it's stupid. And I get it that it's supposed to be like

161
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,260
a saints row game, but it really is not. It's like, you're trying to reboot. You're trying

162
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,940
to create another game and you're throwing the saints row label on it. Like you killed

163
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,880
the franchise. You basically killed the franchise rebooting. It's not going to help at this

164
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,540
point, like best of luck to you. And here's the thing. The game could be pretty good and

165
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,820
there may be are very engaging characters in it. I did not get that from the trailer.

166
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,580
I certainly didn't give that from their comments by the current, the creative leads, which

167
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,180
has been concerned. So the messaging could be bad. The messaging is terrible. It's, it's

168
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:22,220
you can't do worse than that. Like, and this is a company that had, um, uncle Busey, you

169
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,940
know, promoting saints, which was fantastic. Gary Busey promoting saints real too hilarious.

170
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,460
But like, I just, he is, he's crazy. And that, that was the whole point. It was like, he's

171
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,020
talking about weapons and stuff and it was great. And that's, you can do stuff, you can

172
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,820
dial it back in a way. Like if you want to make it like, I get it, like maybe pimping in a game

173
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,700
that comes out in 2021 is not PC enough for the mainstream audience nowadays. That's fine. Take

174
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:58,020
that out. Okay. Whatever. You know, but like going back to even saints row, the third, they didn't

175
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,740
have drug dealing in it. It was dealing your merch, which was stupid to begin with. But like, I

176
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,900
get the point, like they were just trying to do the same mini game, but like, Oh, we're making it

177
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,620
even more rated G or something for everybody. They're covering their asses. Well, whatever.

178
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,300
It's a, it's a mature rated game. They don't have to like it. They don't do that in grand theft auto,

179
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,500
like take the chances, take the risk. Well, but if that was the case, hot coffee would have still

180
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,220
been in the game in grand theft auto days. There are certain things that they don't want to cross

181
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,420
because they don't want to end up on the NBC nightly news. But that's just, it just wasn't

182
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:40,540
the time. Here's the problem. It is a very American thing. This country has a bigger

183
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,980
problem with sex than it does with violence. Just saying. Yeah. And I get the, I get the idea. They

184
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,340
have to dial it back because like, where do you go from ripping off the matrix and the, you know,

185
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,340
the head of the saints is the president and you know, you've gone into space and stuff of like,

186
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,900
that doesn't make any sense anymore. Like what game is that? Even like it may be a fun game,

187
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,940
but it sounds, it is, it's a parody of a parody. Um, and I get it. You have to dial it back. I

188
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,220
think, like I said, you know, I'm a big fan of Saints Row 2. I thought that that kind of took

189
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,500
what Saints Row had originally established and took it to the next level. Like there was

190
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,740
ridiculous stuff in there that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Like there was a mini game where

191
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,860
you set yourself on fire and drove around on an ATV. Cool. That's that's ridiculous. That's a

192
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,980
little bit extreme. You could rip out and you can rip out signposts and fire hydrants and stuff like

193
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,740
that in like fight people with that. Like that's ridiculous. I did that yesterday, but that's also

194
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,460
a little bit more grounded in reality. Like I, I, I hear them saying that, Oh yes, we're going to

195
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,740
make this game, you know, we're going to dial it back and stuff. And it's like, but once again,

196
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,100
they have the same, almost the same factions that they did is Saints Row the third. It's like the

197
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,300
remaking Saints Row the third. We've got, we've got this one faction that, you know, Oh, they're

198
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,940
kind of cyber technology. Okay. Well that's like in Saints Row the third. Oh, we have this other

199
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,420
faction, you know, they're more of like muscle and stuff like that. Okay. Like the luchadors.

200
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,300
Um, and then, Oh yeah. And then we've got this, you know, kind of security company. Oh, you mean

201
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,740
like in Saints Row the third, they're literally remaking Saints Row the third again for the fourth

202
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,620
time. Like, all right. I got, I got to get some comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash

203
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,100
vog network. Uh, we had a comment about the gameplay. I wanted to read here. She Hulk 10

204
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,420
in our chat says the actual gameplay part looked last gen Xbox three 60 era graphics. That's why

205
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,420
they chopped it up with video cut scenes. They only showed like four seconds of gameplay, right?

206
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,180
They did only show like a few seconds of gameplay. They've also done early. They know they also had,

207
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,500
they showed some more like in another, they've been doing these clips where like they had some,

208
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,140
I literally thought like I saw videos coming out and I thought that it was going to be an

209
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,260
apology video for such a terrible like trailer that they did, but no, instead it was just more

210
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,340
than doubling down on that. And they did show a little bit more gameplay footage than that, but

211
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,940
it looks like Saints Row. I mean, that's what it is. It looks like Saints Row, but the problem is

212
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,540
like, like the, yeah, the gameplay could be solid, but the care you need characters and like, yeah,

213
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,660
I get it. Maybe Kevin is a really cool character. I didn't get that from it. It just felt ridiculous.

214
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,180
It felt, it felt stupid. He does, the characters lacked charisma. Like,

215
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,540
whereas in the first game, like this nerve and talent, you, you really like, you know,

216
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,380
kind of like really get attached to these characters and like just their storylines.

217
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,980
They have depth to them, but like these characters meant nothing to me. And if it's like, Oh, these,

218
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,260
they're, they're college students and they have student loans and stuff like that. Like,

219
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm sorry that like, what is this? Like, it's like, it's a millennial power fantasy.

220
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,980
It's like, it's so stupid. It's like, is this what they really think gangsters are nowadays?

221
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,540
It's just like people like, well, we're going to go. And even that trailer was stupid. It's

222
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:05,100
just like, Oh yeah, we're starting a criminal enterprise. Like, it's just like, it's stupid.

223
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,020
All right, grandpa, let's get you to bed. No, I get it. I get, I get, I understand the concerns.

224
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,380
A lot of the community, a lot of the community, here's the only reason I will, I will take a

225
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,980
chance on this game is because idle Ninja, who we'll get to about later, said that, listen,

226
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,700
like he had contributed to like, you know, feedback and stuff for it and said that the

227
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,740
game that they're making looks really positive and looks like a pretty solid game. So I will

228
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,060
give it a chance based on that. But so far, the marketing has been absolutely terrible.

229
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,500
And if this is the direction that they're going, it's just going to not be good.

230
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,620
There's been a lot of games where the marketing wasn't very good, but the game ended up being a

231
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,180
little bit better than that. I mean, honestly, like my brain, the first place my brain goes

232
00:19:53,180 --> 00:20:01,020
is the entire Sony PlayStation 3 unveiling concert unveiling event, right? I mean, all this talk

233
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,060
about Ridge Racer and giant enemy crabs. I mean, all that stuff. I mean, I don't think that

234
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:12,380
particular game was notable, but all that stuff ended up out, out shadowing all the games

235
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,820
themselves. It's more, that's more of an awkward and out of touch versus like, this is just in,

236
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,580
this has been the contention for a while now. Like people have been asking for certain things

237
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,580
like Saints Row the Third. Once again, they made, I don't know if they don't, if Volition knows how

238
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,900
to craft a good story is I think the problem because like in Saints Row the Third, they're

239
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,220
like, yeah, we're going to, we're going to kill off one of the fan's favorite characters because

240
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Ooh, you didn't see that twist coming. Like that was the reasoning for behind it. Like,

241
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh, it will have some emotional impact. Yeah. People getting mad at you for doing that.

242
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,180
Like, and then they, then they like try to retcon it in the next game. They're all this kidding. He,

243
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,540
he got abducted by aliens. He didn't really die. It's like, come on. Like it is, it's just really

244
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,780
stupid. And I think that they don't know how to craft a story and I get it there. There is

245
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,660
a, you know, I don't want to dog on the developers here, but like, dude, look at the stuff that you're

246
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,740
putting out. Like, look at how like the people you're talking heads are putting out this kind

247
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,420
of stuff. Like what am I supposed to think at this point? Like, I get it. I don't have to buy

248
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:19,100
your game, but I don't know. I I'm very skeptical that this is going to be good at this point. It'll

249
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,380
be solid gameplay, but. DJ Rama S in chat says, I think we need to wait until more info on the

250
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,580
game comes out. Well, I mean, perhaps there's somewhat negative reception. I mean, of course,

251
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,220
we're just, I mean, in, in this bubble, we're just hearing from Loki, but I do feel like on the

252
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,820
wider, like social media and stuff, I don't feel like that trailer landed as big as people hoped

253
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,180
it would. And I think maybe I know Loki, you weren't as into the over the top comedy, but I

254
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:53,580
think that being completely missing was kind of damaging. I, and I think he goes, yeah, what's

255
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,420
what's considered over the top, like the, the space alien thing. And like, I'll read this

256
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,700
comment bonds. Double 06 says Epic game store gave away saints row, third remaster. That is true.

257
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,620
And the first question my girlfriend asked after seeing the trailer, do we still get the

258
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:15,260
penetrator? So that, that is, I think what people are talking about. Yeah. You won't get that

259
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,860
because that is too offensive nowadays. I know many millennials that have a giant purple dildo

260
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,700
bad as their power fantasy. So they sold it. I mean, people have that. It's just like,

261
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,220
yeah, that unfortunately nowadays people are going to take offense to it. And so they're not going to

262
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,820
put it in their game. Like I am fine with that. Who cares? The weapon was stupid. It was just like,

263
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,780
he, he looked at what we did. Like, you know, there's other things that they could do that

264
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:51,340
the saints row games have a really like, they really like to dive into this crazy BDSM

265
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,980
scene that they have in, in a lot of them. So there's a lot of like these weird

266
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:03,260
missions revolving around that kind of stuff. So I, are they going to still do that? Who knows?

267
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,500
I, I, I'm not even getting into like the details with that stuff. Like I don't care about weapons

268
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,300
and stuff right now. I'm more considering like, who are the characters? Who's the story about here?

269
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,820
And so far, I'm not liking what I'm seeing. All right. They're not interesting. All right.

270
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,460
Enough saints row. We've gone 20 minutes about saints row. Let's talk about some of the other

271
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,820
stuff at games com. So Loki, what were some of the other things we saw I guess in the opening

272
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,340
night or the Xbox or wherever you want to start? Yeah, sure. So starting off with like the Xbox

273
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:40,540
stuff more games, you know, we saw a new trailer for dying light two, which looks pretty awesome.

274
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:47,580
And that's supposed to be coming out here pretty soon. 7th of December. We've also got some more

275
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:55,660
footage of Microsoft flight simulator, which looks pretty cool. There is going to be, I guess,

276
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:02,460
some deal to bring a lot of the humble games to Xbox game pass on day one. So if you don't

277
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,900
remember humble is now also a publisher of games. So some of those indie games will be coming as

278
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:16,140
well. Let's see more stuff about games past ultimate and cloud gaming on Xbox consoles is

279
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:23,980
holiday. So that's pretty awesome that you've been able to do that. We had some DLC announced

280
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:32,220
for wasteland three, the holy detonation. It's more sea of thieves stuff. The mayhem ship they

281
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:42,140
had. So those are kind of cool stated decay to homecoming straight blade, lots of different stuff.

282
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:49,260
But yeah, I think I didn't get to see this, but I know that they ended with Forza horizon five,

283
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,740
which looks amazing. So definitely want to check that out eventually. So yeah. Yeah. Sadly,

284
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,940
I couldn't watch either one of these. I really just had to see the highlight reel just because

285
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,900
the timing was right in the middle of the workday, which, you know, it's it games com is a Europe

286
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,740
centered event. So yes, the time zones work out that it's a little earlier in the day for us.

287
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,500
But yeah, sadly, I kind of had to hear about this stuff after the fact, but I need to go back and

288
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,820
watch that Forza horizon five extra footage because apparently it shows the intro of the game,

289
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,820
which Forza horizon four had such a good one. Yeah, it's just it'll be interesting to see how

290
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:33,420
they top it. Yeah. And then let's see. So with the games com live, they're opening night stuff.

291
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,860
So aside from Saints Row, they showed off a trailer for Midnight Sons, which apparently

292
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:48,220
is that new strategy RPG from the folks that make Xcom. So that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I have some

293
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,900
people very excited about that. I've checked that out, too. Yeah. So that looked interesting. They

294
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,420
showed a trailer for Call of Duty Vanguard, the single player campaign for that. And that's coming

295
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,180
out November 5th. Looked like Call of Duty looked pretty cinematic. So pretty awesome.

296
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,380
Show off some new trailer for Halo Infinite. They had one for like the multiplayer as well.

297
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,940
We had this cool indie game called Cult of the Lamb that's coming from Devolver Digital.

298
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:28,380
Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. Yay. That's got a bunch of like characters, including Morgana.

299
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:36,380
And what else? They showed off a trailer for Lego Star Wars, the Skywalker Saga, which has now

300
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,180
been pushed back even more. So I think that's coming out next year now. The Outlast Trials,

301
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:48,700
in case you haven't played enough of the Outlast series. What else we get?

302
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,940
In case you didn't poop your pants enough playing the first two Outlast games. Here you go. Here's

303
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,300
a new one. Yeah, they have another trailer for Far Cry 6, which is coming out in this October.

304
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,580
Trailer for New World, which is coming out at the end of September. Age of Empires 4,

305
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:12,380
Valheim Hearth and Home, which I'm not sure if that's oh, that's an update that they're doing

306
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:19,020
with some balancing changes. Sifu, which is that kind of stylized martial arts game.

307
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,980
Death Stranding Director's Cut, which looks weird. What was all that weird side stuff they had in it?

308
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,180
They had a Mario Kart game type of thing in it. It's shenanigans.

309
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,980
We're just going to put all of the game into the game.

310
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:39,980
It is, but I'm not going to lie. I'm kind of into it. And I do want to get it whenever I get a

311
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,700
PlayStation 5. But I think I'll kind of wait for the newness to wear off a little bit so that it

312
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,780
maybe goes on sale a bit. But yeah, I have to admit all this extra stuff in Death Stranding,

313
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,780
some of it is so absurd. I kind of have to see it just because the game itself was so

314
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,540
such a unique mood. I don't want to use any negative terms because I actually really enjoyed

315
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,180
the game, but it was very unique for a video game. And so the fact that they're adding kind

316
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:14,220
of these silly tropes into it is fascinating to me. Then they have this other game called Dokke V,

317
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,260
which is almost like a, not necessarily like a Pokemon game, but it's a monster catching game.

318
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,220
Where you catch like a Dokke V, they say, where you exist with these monsters. But it's like,

319
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,620
kind of looks better than like Pokemon. Pokemon the hardcore.

320
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,180
It's like Pokemon, but it looks pretty awesome. Like, I don't know.

321
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:42,300
Yeah, I'm curious to hear more about it. So they have that. And I think that was pretty

322
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,140
much everything. Yeah. I mean, there was a lot. I mean, that opening night live was like a two

323
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,460
hour long thing. It was a long presentation, but you know, lots of good updates in there,

324
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,420
especially considering the bulk of what is coming out the rest of the year. We know about at this

325
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,260
point, you know, there's not going to be really any more holiday surprises. There may be a little

326
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,900
thing here or there, but there's not going to be any big surprises at this point. Well, they

327
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,380
can always, I mean, Nintendo does their own thing whenever they want to. But even then I wouldn't

328
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,620
set the bar too high for a Nintendo surprise. Oh gosh. My, my bar with Nintendo is incredibly low.

329
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,820
I would say like a Nintendo surprise would be Tetris 99 type of thing, you know, and I'm not

330
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:26,460
saying literally that, but you know, something in that caliber, like Pac-Man 99 kind of ended

331
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,060
up being so, or whatever it's called. There I'm not, well, maybe there will be another 99 game,

332
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,020
who knows, but I would think something in that kind of vein is where to, you know,

333
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,900
aim appropriately when it comes to big surprise for the holiday. Orange Ride in Chat says,

334
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,340
I'm sure people will still believe Nintendo is going to bring the great pumpkin.

335
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,540
Possibly. Yeah. A lot of people on Twitter and social media set the bar too high when it comes

336
00:29:50,540 --> 00:30:02,940
to Nintendo. So probably. Oh, comment from Tiger Claw, who I know watches all things Ninja Turtles

337
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,220
very carefully. Is a big week for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as April was announced in Shredder's

338
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:14,060
Revenge. Yes. That, I did see a little bit on that, you know, it's, it's basically a throwback

339
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,060
to the old Ninja Turtles arcade game, right? Though the Ninja Turtles game, everybody loved,

340
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:25,260
right? And now they're, you know, kind of the, the Shredder's Revenge is very much that,

341
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,020
but, you know, for, for 2021 and now April is actually playable in it, which is kind of neat.

342
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,140
The fact that she kind of beats people with their microphones kind of fun. I've wanted to do the

343
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:44,300
same thing several times. So pretty fun. All right. Yeah. Let's talk about some things we

344
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,380
have been playing this week, not just the stuff we're looking forward to. Let's get into a segment

345
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,900
called how was your gaming week and what are the types of games you've been playing this week?

346
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:58,380
Dr. Sakura, we'll start with you. I did finally get my start back on Final Fantasy 14.

347
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,340
They put me right back on the same server my other two characters were on,

348
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,580
even though I tried something different. So whatever. And of course I played Dead

349
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:16,380
by Daylight. Apparently, and now this was actually a build that was suggested to me

350
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,980
and we did some modifications to it. Apparently my resident Pigou build is loved.

351
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,100
I was watching when you had Nick and Prince play your build on his stream. That was fun. Yeah.

352
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,420
Isn't it evil? It is just the whole concept of, yeah. Anyway, I don't want to,

353
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,980
we talk about too much Dead by Daylight on the show. I'm not going to get it.

354
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:50,300
Bourbon played it today. Oh, okay. And we switched out a corrupt intervention for Lethal Pursuer.

355
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,180
And it was pretty vicious. So I'm going to have to take that and incorporate it into the official

356
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,780
resident Pigou. All right. So anyway, and if anyone who's playing wants to know what resident

357
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,180
Pigou is, let me know. But it's called that because it relies on playing the Raccoon Police

358
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,860
Department, AKA RuPaul's Drag Station. Or just watch Dark Soccer's stream on Twitch.

359
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,420
I've been trying to get a number two rule set and have it or a tamper timer. No luck.

360
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,780
So I'm going back to leveling Pyramid Daddy with his nerfed butt.

361
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,820
Does he have any less power now that his butt's flatter? No, it's a graphical thing.

362
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,460
Freddy. Yeah, Freddy's power got nerfed in it, but it's not that bad. It's not that bad. It's not

363
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,820
that bad. No, a lot of people just start playing him randomly and I'm like, okay, more Freddy for

364
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,460
me. I'm still playing. I'm still playing it exactly the same way. I was playing pre-nerf,

365
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,820
so it's no big, you know. It's gonna be really awkward if they ever add Five Nights at Freddy's

366
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,300
characters with Freddy. It's just gonna be confusing. Well, we're technically going to have

367
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:09,260
two pee pee heads because there's Pinhead coming in now. Yeah. But he's cool. Oh my God. I can't

368
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,060
wait for it to go live and to see if they fix the problems that there were during PTB. Yeah,

369
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,300
I will say I hope Pinhead is in the game around the time I get back from Dragon Con. I don't know

370
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,060
how much longer it's going to take to- You opened the box and I came.

371
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,420
Yeah, that's the first, well, I guess Trickster had it, but that's the first killer that has,

372
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:34,380
you know, such menacing sentences. Trickster's vocals are very like, you know, ha ha ha ha ha.

373
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,540
They got a Korean voice actor for him. Yeah, he has little things, but-

374
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,780
Keep in mind, Adiris had lines. Oh, that's right.

375
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,260
They weren't in English. That's right. No, you're right.

376
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:54,700
But she spoke, it wasn't actually Babylonian. It's like one of the other derivative languages

377
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:01,740
though of that timeframe. I want to say it was like, I'll look it up later, but it was,

378
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,340
it was a derivative. Yeah, anyway, they did research into her, which I thought was really

379
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:15,900
cool. But from that too, I was also playing word skates because I love my word games and

380
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:26,940
I actually got Gardic on stream for me to try to incorporate later. So we'll see if that happens.

381
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,100
It's so much fun though. I love it. So I have to, you know, get my tablet stuff together.

382
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:37,260
All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week. My gaming week. Oh, yeah.

383
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:45,660
We did a pinball trade, so we now have a Rick and Morty as a temporary. Dan traded Metallica

384
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,660
temporarily for us to have the Rick and Morty in our garage. So you want to come play it.

385
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:58,620
I kind of do, because I don't know the Rick and Morty table at all. So I was going to play it the

386
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,140
other day, but you know, I've been getting over this Sinus infection. I'm mostly over it now.

387
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,940
Yeah. So my gaming week, I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight. I did a stream

388
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,620
one night this week randomly, and that was a lot of fun. And I've also been playing like,

389
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,780
just a lot of the like stuff I've talked about on the show before, you know, Final Fantasy 14,

390
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,460
but then I also kind of dipped into some other stuff. I randomly started playing No Man's Sky

391
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,180
and I got an achievement that I hadn't unlocked yet. I was trying to basically get back to the

392
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,540
center of the galaxy again, or no, I was trying to finish the Atlas storyline, which I thought

393
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:38,220
would trigger the center of the galaxy story again, because I thought you also kind of did

394
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,860
the same thing, but it didn't play out the way I thought it would. You kind of just get an item

395
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,340
that instantly like shows you where tons of black holes are. So that's kind of fun. I mean, spoiler

396
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,420
alert, but not really. No Man's Sky is a five-year-old game at this point. I think part

397
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,700
of me is also just anticipating that new patch. And I think I do want a platinum No Man's Sky,

398
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,340
but I'm playing on Xbox. It's not really platinum, but you know what I mean? The hardest achievement

399
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,140
is going to be that permadeath one because permadeath mode isn't just, you know, permadeath,

400
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:13,180
but it's like a higher, like the resources cost more, things drain faster. Like it's going to be

401
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,540
a rough grind to get that one, but I kind of want to try it. So we'll see, but I'm really awaiting

402
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,300
whatever the, you know, there's been, we talked about on a previous episode, there's been teases

403
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:29,820
of another, you know, big content patch for that game. And I'm hoping another seasonal event will

404
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,900
come with that sort of like the Mass Effect thing, but it doesn't have to be a tie in with

405
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,740
anything else. Like I enjoyed the first event for what it was. So I'm hoping there's another

406
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,980
one that comes in pretty soon in that game. That would be fun. And then I played Katamari Damacy

407
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,180
Reroll because that is on Game Pass now. So if you have Xbox, Microsoft, whatever you can play

408
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,660
Katamari Damacy Reroll and that game is still, that's the game is still a joy all these years

409
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,100
later. Cause if you think about it, that's based off the original Katamari game, which was out

410
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:02,460
around the time this show started a long time ago. So it's, it's a delight to play again and

411
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,900
just experience that that's for sure. So that was pretty much my gaming week. So let's move on.

412
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,260
I will mention quickly before we get into the rest of the news from this week,

413
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,620
just some quick housekeeping things. There will not be a live show or a podcast next week,

414
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,340
which is very, you know, if you've been listening to the show for a while,

415
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,060
it's kind of been that way over Labor Day weekend because I'm going to be out of town.

416
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm going to be at Dragon Con. I hope I get to meet a lot of people at Dragon Con,

417
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,900
but at the same time, it's going to be a very different kind of year where I'm really focusing

418
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:40,540
on panels and not so much parties, just because obviously with all the stuff going on out there,

419
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,220
I want to take things a little bit cautiously, although I was very,

420
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:50,060
very happy to hear in the past week, week and a half, Dragon Con kind of made the same move

421
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,580
that PAX ended up making. And that is they will be mandating. You have to have either the vaccine

422
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:02,060
or a negative test in the last 72 hours, whatever. So that's on top of the mask mandate. So that's

423
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,940
makes me feel a lot better, but I'm going to, I'm going to really enjoy the panels. I am on

424
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,980
six different panels this year. I gave an overview of those last week, so I'm not going to detail all

425
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,220
six of them again tonight. I'll just point you over at my Twitter, twitter.com slash Mr. Rob

426
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,020
Roberts, that's MR Rob Roberts. And all of my panels are listed there in the pin post. I made

427
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,300
it my pin post for now. I will point out three of those panels are online. So if you are doing

428
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,380
virtual Dragon Con this year, which many people are, you can check out those three, three of those

429
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,620
six panels I'm going to be doing are going to be streamed online. So I hope to see some of you guys

430
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,860
there. Two of them are on Friday. I have, it's, I have like eight hours of panels on Friday.

431
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,540
Which is, I mean, no, no, I overstated that, but it's, it's a lot. It's an hour and a half,

432
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,340
no, an hour panel and then a half hour break. So it's six hours of panels because it's four

433
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,660
back to back to back, but it'll be fine. I love doing panels. It's my favorite part of the show.

434
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,860
So I'm very excited to do that and hopefully meet some people at Dragon Con this year,

435
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:11,420
either virtually or in person. Okay. That's it for that. We will see you in two weeks

436
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,020
live. So we will not be here next week. I imagine Dark Sakura will be here on Sunday

437
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,580
streaming probably, but I don't know. I don't want to, maybe she'll go out and enjoy. I don't know.

438
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,980
Maybe you'll go out and enjoy the night. I don't know. Maybe I'll do a marathon. Yeah,

439
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,380
there you go. Bobby won't be here either that night for obvious reasons. He does the same

440
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,100
thing that I'm doing. So Sunday night is going to be open. So there you go.

441
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Also, although I don't think any of our regulars are in the area, I do just want to acknowledge

442
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,380
that, that hurricane that's happening in Louisiana right now and the surrounding area. I just, you

443
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,420
know, want to say, I hope everybody is safe and got out of the path of that storm and was able

444
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:59,580
to evacuate and definitely sending my thoughts to those that are affected by that. Cause that does

445
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,540
not sound like a lot of fun right now. So, um, yeah, just, uh, wanted to acknowledge that and

446
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:11,180
hope that all of our listener fam is, uh, in a drier place right now. Okay. Uh, let's get into

447
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,780
some other gaming news. Loki. We'll start with you. Starting that news with what I played this

448
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:22,620
week. Uh, did I skip you completely? I sure did. I'm sorry, Loki. What did you play? It's just,

449
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,980
it's just Minecraft. I know I was gonna say, what did you play anything besides Minecraft?

450
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,340
Uh, you have your own Christian Minecraft server now. I don't have my own Christian

451
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,820
Minecraft server. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to skip you, Logan. Oh, that's all good. Um,

452
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,620
no, I was mainly Minecraft. So like I meant to put out a video this week and then I realized

453
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,340
that we have our road contest thing, which is technically it was due like yesterday, but

454
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,380
you know, the people there are judging it. They're on vacation, so it's fine. So I've been like

455
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:58,540
working in that for a long time. So yeah, still feeling the pressure to put out a video and I

456
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,700
have a lot of content for that. Just had priorities. So, um, anyways, so one thing I

457
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,620
definitely would have seen going to be playing this week is the fan made Metroid prime 2d project.

458
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:19,900
And, um, you know, it was this awesome work by a team, uh, SCU that released the demo for prime

459
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,420
2d. It was a side scrolling remake of Metroid prime that they've been working on it for 15

460
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,340
years. You already know the punchline to this. It's a Nintendo game. So of course,

461
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:36,300
Nintendo was going to put an end to that and they did. They, um, cease and desisted it and it's

462
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:46,460
buh-bye. Um, so yeah, so they put out a, um, a post in Reddit saying, hello, dedicated fans.

463
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,900
It's an announcement that you've been dreading. We have been asked by certain games related company

464
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,380
to discontinue our work on prime 2d in its current form. We have removed the demo download and

465
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,540
soundtrack MP3 download. We are currently in dialogue with that company in terms of

466
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:09,260
they're not going to undo it. I mean, come on. Um, so yeah, this is what happens when you talk

467
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,660
about your game before your games. I just have to make it. And I know you're really excited about it.

468
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,580
You really want to share, you know, the work you got to understand they're going to C and D that

469
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,740
so fast that it's just, I mean, come on, you've been working out for 15 years now or planning,

470
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm sorry, planning for 15 years on it. You kind of knew what was going to happen.

471
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,900
I mean, they've only done it to everything. You, you have to do what they call in the music

472
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,580
industry, a Beyonce, if you might remember Beyonce just dropped an album with no warning,

473
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,700
no lead up, no hype, no nothing. Um, she was really, I don't know. She was the first artist

474
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,020
ever to do it. She's certainly the first that I think of. And, you know, certainly the digital

475
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,340
era, I think kind of changed a lot of the rules. Um, you know, you just, just put it out there

476
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,860
and it's done. And so I think, uh, that's what a lot of these fan projects that are in questionable

477
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,660
territory have to do if they want to actually see a release is they just have to Beyonce it,

478
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,740
uh, and just drop it. Um, not, and again, I get that it's a legal gray area and especially with

479
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,820
a Metroid game coming out next month, Nintendo is going to protect their trademarks and they,

480
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,340
they do this aggressively. This should not be a surprise to anybody. Does it suck? Yes. But at

481
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,820
the same time, should it surprise you? Absolutely not. Um, we can only hope for at this point that

482
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,660
they will be able to redo some of the sprites and some of the things to make it, uh, you know,

483
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:47,100
matroid supper matroid. And you want to contrast this with what like Sega is doing. Sega just had

484
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,060
a fan game festival for Sonic. So they were showing off a ton of fan games that were made

485
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,220
with that. Just different companies, different, you know, philosophies about it, but like

486
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,060
Kano wish Nintendo would just take the Sega philosophy, you know,

487
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:07,740
Sega does what intend don't. And that's not finally allowing fan games to exist. Yeah.

488
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,900
All right. Um, let's move on. This is, this next story has had a lot of people talking this week,

489
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,620
especially on social media. Um, you know, and just a couple of weeks on ago on the show,

490
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:24,300
we were talking about the Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite and how, um, it was very unique and it

491
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,460
really had people thinking about Fortnite as an artistic platform and as, you know, oh, maybe for,

492
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,300
you know, and, and if you've looked in some of the things that, you know, Epic and they've all

493
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,020
said about Fortnite in the past is that they want Fortnite to be this, you know, not just

494
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,820
their battle royale game, but they want it to be basically a pop culture, you know, puddle. Um,

495
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,620
so that makes this, this interest, this latest development from this week, very fascinating.

496
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:58,540
Um, and that is that time magazine helped craft an interactive exhibit called March through time.

497
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:07,340
It is a, uh, uh, interactive experience all about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Uh, and, uh, I have not,

498
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,660
I don't have Fortnite even installed on my computer, so I haven't been able to experience

499
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,100
it myself. Um, but I am told that you will, uh, transport to DC 1963, which is a re-imagined

500
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,380
version of the nation's Capitol that allows you to visit, um, exhibits that are kind of like a

501
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:29,900
virtual museum. Uh, they actually kind of explain what Dr. King's speech is all about, uh, talks

502
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,180
about the, the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. Uh, and I believe you can actually, um,

503
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:42,460
uh, hear the entire I have a dream speech in there. Um, and you earn a special spray that you

504
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,100
can use in your Fortnite matches from going through the experience, perhaps to entice people

505
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:54,060
to go to it. Um, and this has gotten a lot of feedback because there's been a lot of things

506
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:00,860
from like what to, hey, Fortnite's trying to do a good thing and, and bring education to the

507
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:09,500
children, to these very interesting pictures of, let's say the Xenomorph from Alien, who is a

508
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:16,300
playable character in Fortnite walking around Washington, DC, 1963 with Rick from Rick and

509
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:22,220
Morty. Um, and this experience has already had some issues too, is that they had to disable emotes,

510
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:29,660
uh, from outside, I guess the experience brings eight unique emotes. Um, so you can use those

511
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,700
unique ones in the experience, but you can't bring the outside ones in anymore because people

512
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:40,460
were doing things that were inappropriate. And it's a lot of the, um, optics that are causing

513
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,780
some people to take issue with, like, for example, the loading screen will give you a tip for how to

514
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,940
play Fortnite Battle Royale, which might involve like how to properly use the gun, which is a

515
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:59,420
little bit tasteless when you consider the end of the story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It's

516
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,260
pretty tasteless. So some of those optics don't play out too well. Um, I don't know. I, I don't

517
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:11,260
know. I, I feel like I want to experience it for myself before I really form an opinion, but I do

518
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:17,740
kind of feel like it's extremely well-intentioned. It's, and I saw a very, I saw a very interesting

519
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,500
comment that I thought is worth repeating, and I'm very sorry. I don't know who said the comment.

520
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,780
It's one of those things I picked up on Twitch, or I'm sorry, not Twitch, Twitter, the other TW,

521
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,940
um, on, and somebody had said, you know what? If they're gonna not teach critical race theory

522
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,660
in schools and people have to learn about critical, you know, that type of stuff through Fortnite,

523
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:43,340
that's wild, but I'm glad they're doing it type of thing. And it did kind of stop and give me pause.

524
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,940
I was like, cause you know, I'd seen a lot of the negative blowback on the experience,

525
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,740
but when I saw that comment, I was like, fuck, this person has a point. When you consider what

526
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:58,540
Fortnite's target audience really is, which is kids around Loki's age. I don't know if it's

527
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,660
really a bad thing that they get to- I hope kids are not my age.

528
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,780
Sorry, sorry. You know what I mean? The kids that are Loki's kids age.

529
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:15,580
Hey, fellow kids. Um, I actually, I kind of like, you know what? I, I think it's pretty well

530
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:23,580
intact. I think, I think there's a lot of like optic issues and like learning curve types of

531
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:30,780
things that maybe this isn't where I would have started and maybe learned about some of those

532
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:37,100
things by maybe, but at the same time, again, it's, it's hard to be upset about it, but I do

533
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,460
think there's a lot of feedback that Epic and the Fortnite team could certainly hear about it.

534
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,780
I don't know. What do you guys think? I don't know. Has anybody played it at all or what do

535
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:54,700
you think? Well, I don't play Fortnite. No. But I think honestly, though, well-intentioned is a very

536
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,740
apt description for something like this. And I think it could be positive, especially given,

537
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:10,940
again, that we've got these states that are rolling back education about such an important

538
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:18,700
part of American history. But I think that, that it's not enough, that it's just one focus.

539
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:30,220
Um, I, it, it will, it will be, I think, helpful and bring some attention, but I think that we

540
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:39,740
need broader education out there and accurate representation. Um, not black and white photos,

541
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,900
but photos that were taken in color in the sixties, because it wasn't that long ago.

542
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,980
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says apparently kids have reactive really positively towards this and

543
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,940
they have actually shocked their gamer parents. And that is a good point. I think is that it can

544
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:02,860
start a conversation that I think is a good conversation to have. Um, and I don't know what

545
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,500
else to say. I think, I think, I think there are, again, there's, there's many good things about

546
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,700
this. I just think that the putting it in Fortnite and it's almost like you're, you're,

547
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:17,020
you're kind of like jumping like five steps ahead to this thing that it's like, this is,

548
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:21,660
this is very good. This is very important and we're glad it's here now, but maybe there would

549
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:27,420
have been some learning steps along the way before we got here, but it's, it's hard to look at this

550
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:34,380
and go. It's terrible. I think it's, it's just, I think so many of us were unprepared for Fortnite

551
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:43,660
to bring this. So it's interesting. Um, let's see, uh, other comments in chat. I wanted to say

552
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,860
here, um, DJ Rama S in chat says, got to educate these youngins one way or another.

553
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:56,620
Uh, Mike Deft in chat says, it's like, it's a nice gesture, but this ain't it chief. Um, yeah. Uh,

554
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,340
and then, uh, move, moves on to a reply to Bobby saying, if the end of all of this is positive,

555
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,620
then I'm all for it. Even if I don't agree with how it's done entirely. Um, Quest Buster brings

556
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,820
up an interesting kind of like, um, analogy, I guess, uh, is, uh, with Ubisoft's, uh, relatively

557
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,780
recent Assassin's Creed titles have tried to do with their history walkthroughs of ancient Egypt

558
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,220
and Greece, that they can use games to at least spark a sense of discovery instead of simply being

559
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,540
games. Excuse me. You know, I thought of that too, actually. And I thought about also a game like

560
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:37,100
civilization and how much I learned from really loving that game when I was in high school.

561
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,340
And even though that wasn't an edutainment game, it wasn't the Oregon trail. It wasn't

562
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,940
Carmen San Diego. I certainly learned a lot about some of the natural wonders of the world or the,

563
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,140
you know, manmade ones as well. Some of the wonders of the world, if you will,

564
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,900
through that game, you learn about leaders of the world and their different styles,

565
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,860
except they kind of messed up Gandhi. And if you know civilization, you, you get the joke there.

566
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:07,100
If you don't look it up, uh, Gandhi was, he was problematic. Yes. Um, but anyway, there was,

567
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:14,620
there was, um, anyway, there's a lot I learned from playing civilization, um, that, uh, I,

568
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,820
I wouldn't have gotten if not the fact that I really enjoyed the game. So it's, I don't know.

569
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,780
I, uh, I, I was tempted to download Fortnite just to check this out. It's just one of those things

570
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,260
where I don't have the bandwidth to download a 60 gig game right now. Um, but I, I really should

571
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,940
have sat down and watched at least a YouTube or somebody playing through it on Twitch. I'd like

572
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:43,820
to sort of see it for myself, um, to get more out of it. Um, but I, again, I think it's a very,

573
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,940
I think it's going to start a bigger conversation. Um, and I think this whole idea of educating

574
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,380
people through video games is generally a great direction for the industry. And I think we just

575
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,100
have to figure out what's the magic formula to really make that work so that we don't have,

576
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,140
you know, offensive emotes coming from the, the xenomorph and the aliens, you know,

577
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,700
trying to look through the exhibit or what have you. So. I don't think it's necessarily that it

578
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:14,540
was like offensive in the sense that the emotes were offensive. I think it's more of like,

579
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:19,340
you know, maybe we shouldn't be like doing the Carlton while Martin Luther King's giving his

580
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:24,860
speech. I think it was more of that, like, this is not the time for that. Right. Um,

581
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:33,100
our man with the voiceovers VX chase next V in chat says learning through concepts is one thing

582
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,820
learning through interactive concepts is another. And yes, I agree with that. I think, and again,

583
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,860
you know, kind of going back to what Bobby is saying is that this is, this is starting

584
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,260
conversations. I th I think this is a good thing. We just have to figure out how do, how do we

585
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,140
make sure it's right and that we don't have people doing the Carlton, you know, when people,

586
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,380
you know, and, and those sorts of things. Cause unfortunately on the internet, things are going

587
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,740
to, maybe this should have been something that was like explored as a single player or in a party

588
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:06,700
with friends only type of thing. Um, I don't know. I, I'm not, I'm not saying definitively that

589
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,980
should have been it. I'm just saying maybe there's some other things we have to kind of figure out

590
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,660
about how to get all that to work. So anyway, I'm sure we will hear more on this and other

591
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:22,700
similar things as Fortnite dips into the, um, the edge, the education for the children as well.

592
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:28,140
I'm also curious, Loki, if your kid, maybe your kids are a little bit too young, but well, I don't

593
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:33,020
know. I don't know, but I'd be curious to see if they end up in this and what they get out of it.

594
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:38,940
I'd be very curious about that. Oh, they don't play Fortnite. So I thought they did. Oh, it's

595
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,020
Roblox. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless, unless they're, they're doing a Martin Luther King thing and

596
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:51,420
wacky wizards or in, uh, Brookhaven, I don't think it's going to happen. Well, it'll be

597
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,820
interesting to see what the industry kind of looks at this and does. And I honestly, I mean,

598
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,660
let's be real. Fortnite has ripped off from everything else. Let's just, let's just spill

599
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:05,740
the tea. Everything in Fortnite was ripped off of someone else. And honestly what Questbuster was

600
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,220
explaining about that Assassin's Creed. Hmm. Where do you think, where do you think they may have

601
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:18,620
gotten the inspiration? I'm allegedly, supposedly, maybe hypothesis planning is completely

602
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,260
historically accurate nowadays, you know, with its Pegasus and Norths gods and all that stuff.

603
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,500
Well, but they, they do have those educational modes that, you know, bring a little more to it,

604
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:33,580
not the actual game part anyway. All right. Does it talk about the, uh, the harboring of sex

605
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,580
abusers and Ubisoft as well? Is that part of the education I'm also going to be getting from this?

606
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,780
You know, I think they omitted that part. Uh, that's, that's something they got to rely on the,

607
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:48,700
the community to remind people of is that there are still many problems with the industry. Uh,

608
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:53,020
but I think we come to some of those a little later in the show. So I will, uh, get to that

609
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:59,260
later. Uh, in the meantime, how about a nice, how about a nice story that takes Orange Lounge Radio

610
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,540
back to its roots? Let's go to Dark Sakura for its next story. These roots are kind of grown out,

611
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:09,660
aren't they? A little bit. These roots give me a heart attack these days, but I think it's neat.

612
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:21,660
Oh, Rob. Um, so, well, long gone are the days of Mr. Spanky and Betty. Um, there is a new

613
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:30,460
dance dance revolution, uh, PC coming out. Um, and I'm actually looking at the tweet here,

614
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:37,100
uh, that came out with this one and hold on, let me, let me see if I can take a better look

615
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:45,500
at the tweet. Uh, notice of the version of dance dance revolution, second open alpha test

616
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:52,540
for a limited time will be holding the it's it's translated as Konaste,

617
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:59,180
um, version of dance, dance revolution, second open alpha test. Please take this opportunity

618
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:07,020
to try it. Um, from what I can at least tell from what the tweet says it is in Japanese and I'm

619
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:16,300
kind of half reading it. Um, Oh, good. They translated it. Uh, anyway. Um, so Konami has

620
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:24,940
ended the alpha test for, uh, DDR V five, I guess it is an HTML five browser version of DDR and

621
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:30,860
renewed the game with a second open alpha test. Uh, so DDR, uh, dancers revolution PC for the

622
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:37,580
Konami amusement game station. So that's Konaste. That's where that came from. Also known as EA

623
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:44,620
cloud or maybe alpha, I guess. Um, but it's going to run from August 24th, 2021 through September

624
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:53,340
six, 2021. Um, it is very similar to the arcade version, DDR a 20 plus, and I was surprised

625
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:58,780
because I didn't even realize there was a plus version of that game. Yep. There is. It only has

626
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:05,260
a few songs in it and, um, no safe feature. Um, but the dance pad is up on Konami style and

627
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,860
dance pad look nice. I gotta say they look very different now, but in true Konami style fashion,

628
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,140
though, you, they have to get a thousand pre-orders in order to actually make it.

629
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:20,860
As I was saying, I may have already, uh, told the husband I'm pre-ordering one. Oh, good for you.

630
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:34,220
Um, the price of it right now is 17,380 yen. So roughly about 170 bucks really isn't that

631
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:39,020
bad considering, um, is it a hard pad or is it, I mean, it looked like one of those like

632
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:43,660
cheapy soft pads. I mean, I don't know. It looked like it might be the foamy kind.

633
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:54,380
That's kind of, hold on a second. I was to say it might be the price might make more sense if it's

634
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,980
one of the foamy type of things. Like, uh, you remember towards, I want to say the end of when

635
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,660
we were all playing DDR, but it was around that time they had, I think red octane or one of those

636
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:13,500
companies put out foam, uh, some comments to chat, uh, Jason in chat says EA cloud is EMU's cloud.

637
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,980
Orange, right. It says the pad is way overpriced. If it's a regular soft mat. I agree.

638
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:23,260
Darted says it has a free mode, but it locks you to pre DDR stuff. Maybe they don't want you to

639
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:29,500
play all the arcade stuff for free. Um, you know, and that's also in like, this coming out also

640
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:34,540
doesn't surprise me when we've had a B-Mania 2DX we've had a, you know, we've had other

641
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:40,940
Bimani games that Konami has looked at putting on PC anyway. Sorry. So I have, I have more USB

642
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,180
connection, Bluetooth, low energy compatible, no compatible service at this time, body weight

643
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:54,220
approx a size 983 millimeters by 840 millimeters body weight, 1.4 kilogram USB cable, not included

644
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:01,820
corresponding service PC version, connoisse, dance dance revolution, uh, has a music pack comes with

645
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:09,260
it. Uh, purchase benefits will be reserved to their Konami ID. So there's a lot to your Konami

646
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:16,700
ID. Um, bonus songs will look like also be going through Konami ID, um, number of units,

647
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:23,260
a thousand units order acceptance period, August 24th through September 6th. Just reading the,

648
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:32,860
I just ran it through, um, a translator. Nice. I'll, I'll wait, you know, until they crack it

649
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:39,660
to allow me to play whatever songs I want and it will happen immediately. So true. I can't wait.

650
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:49,100
Um, so as far as other, uh, things to go with this system requirements are, um, uh, Windows 10 64

651
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:55,660
bit, um, at least 2.8 gigahertz processor recommended Intel core I five or higher AMD

652
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:04,700
eight at 3.5 gigahertz or higher, uh, 40 gigabytes of hard drive space of recommended

653
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:11,420
Ram eight gigabytes, uh, video Ram one gigabyte or higher. I mean, that makes sense if it's going

654
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:19,740
to be playing music and graphics, I mean, you'll, you'll need it. So, um, direct X nine, uh, C or

655
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:26,620
higher stereo on board sound recommended resolution 1280 by seven 20 at 60 kilohertz.

656
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,100
The arcade hardware. I mean, that's basically kind of what they're talking about there,

657
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:35,180
because that's, I think what the arcade machines run and they run on PCs anyway.

658
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,660
Are you saying they just repurpose the arcade software for a home version? You've got,

659
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:46,940
well, I finished the story. All right. All right. Okay. Um, so the songs that are included right

660
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:53,260
now is make it better. Keep on moving, drop the bomb higher, broken my heart. Oh,

661
01:01:53,260 --> 01:02:04,220
Polteri comes back exotic ethnic destiny. Xenon Astra gazer, uh, digital love Helios level up

662
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:14,220
hyper bomb in the past splash gold. And one more thing, hold on. Cause I have to translate it.

663
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:21,820
I don't read that much kanji. Um, one way ticket to space.

664
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:38,780
So looking at the product page, it is a soft mat and it's wireless Bluetooth though as well,

665
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:45,740
but for a soft mat, no, no, no, no, no $100. Even if it's wireless, I don't care if it's

666
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:51,580
like there's toys, they're wireless. Like it doesn't cost $100 to put a Bluetooth module

667
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:58,940
into their thing that that is vastly overpriced. Um, although like I do show them folding it up,

668
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:05,980
like you can fold it down, but like maybe there's maybe technology has advanced further than the

669
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:14,460
soft pads of lore. Um, but I, I don't know. Like it just, it looks cheap. Definitely not

670
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,340
something I'd buy for a hundred dollars. All right. But I definitely want to check

671
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,380
out the game at some point. That's for sure. Yeah. All right. Check out the game.

672
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:29,100
Yeah. Anything else on to report on DDR PC Darsagra? Apparently not.

673
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,540
All right. Let's move on to our next story. Loki.

674
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:38,220
Yeah. So halo infinite was something that they also were talking about during, um,

675
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:45,180
games com the opening night live. So they talked, well, first the release date for halo infinite

676
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:50,060
leaked out and then it was confirmed to be true. So it is going to be coming out December 8th.

677
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:58,300
And, uh, along with that, they're going to be having some brand new, uh, um, limited edition

678
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:03,980
consoles and whatnot. So they're going to have a, an Xbox series X that's going to launch, um,

679
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:12,060
on November 15th. And then, um, looks like we also have the elite series two controller,

680
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,620
which launches November 15th. Maybe I was wrong on that date. I think that was, was it November

681
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:21,660
15th for the game actually? Yeah. November 15th for the game as well. Um, I'm saying why I think

682
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:27,500
December 8th, that's weird. Um, anyways, so those are going to be coming. I like the controller,

683
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:33,100
the leak controller, not buying it for $200, but it looks nice. I mean, and that, uh, the series

684
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:39,020
X looks nice. Um, I, I like the con I like the controller with that console. I would buy that

685
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:48,780
separately. Um, but I already have an Xbox series X, so scan it, I guess. I don't know. Um,

686
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,420
oh yeah, no, I'm sorry. So yeah, the console's coming out November 15th game is coming out

687
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:01,820
December 8th. I knew I didn't forget that. Um, the limited edition Xbox series X,

688
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:08,780
550 bucks. And then the elite series controller, $200 vastly overpriced if you ask me, but

689
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:15,900
I mean, it's, it's, it's a controller. It looks the master chief.

690
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,860
And this, the system is so, so good looking. I really want one.

691
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:27,340
Yeah, the system looks nice. Um, yeah. And then they didn't really show too much. They

692
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:35,420
have like a cinematic trailer for like, um, I guess the multiplayer. I don't really know

693
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:39,580
what exactly was, that was all about. It kind of didn't make any sense to me, but,

694
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:45,180
you know, glad to know that there's that it's coming soon, the release of that.

695
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:50,300
And they were able to get their act together pretty fast, but yeah, we'll have to wait and

696
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,380
see. I'm sure we'll hear more about it as soon as we get closer to that date.

697
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:00,060
E3 VL in chat says, uh, over twitch.tv slash vog network says I heard launch content for the game.

698
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:04,300
Isn't that great? Yeah. It seems like they're going to really be kind of adding a lot to it

699
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,420
as it goes. The co-op is not going to be there at launch, which is kind of weird.

700
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,100
Which would usually be very obnoxious. Um, and I think the folks that are paying the

701
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:18,060
full $60 price tag may have some reservations with that, but we also have to remember Microsoft

702
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,940
is really all in on game pass at this point. And I think, you know, if they can still get a lot of

703
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,260
people to check the game out on game pass in a way that's still a win for them. And I think there will

704
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:31,020
be a lot of people that will check out, even if it's just kind of like partial halo, I'll be one

705
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:38,700
of them. I enjoy halo enough to check out on game pass. Um, whatever, whatever parts of the game are

706
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:44,620
there, uh, the day that it launches. So it's just interesting to kind of think about. Yeah,

707
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,700
the whole game's not really there, but when you think about Microsoft's overall strategy,

708
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:53,420
is it that surprising? I mean, I think we all know the development of the game plays that we have

709
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,540
right now. Yeah. Cause like every game nowadays has a roadmap for it. I mean, it's becoming more

710
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:05,980
acceptable, unfortunately. Um, but I mean, I kind of, I trust that Microsoft will put out a decent

711
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,740
game. I mean, they, they kind of know what they're doing three for three knows what they're doing

712
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:16,540
with, um, these games. So we'll have to wait and see. All right. I'm not getting a day one anyways.

713
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:20,780
So, I mean, I guess I can play it on games pass. So in a sense that we'll be getting a day one,

714
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:26,700
but yeah. All right. Well, moving on to our next story. So, um, on a prior episode of the show,

715
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,620
dark soccer and I were bantering a little bit about the, um, stranger things content being

716
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:35,660
removed from dead by daylight, uh, in November. And, uh, certainly a lot of speculation as to

717
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:41,180
the reasons why it was going away led to the fact that, Oh, Netflix is doing, we know that Netflix

718
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,740
is planning their own, uh, gaming service and stranger things probably ties into that. And then

719
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:51,740
there was even more fuel on the fire. Uh, when I had noticed that on games pass, uh, the stranger

720
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:58,700
things three RPG was set to leave the service on September 1st. And as it turns out, there is

721
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,820
something going on with stranger things and Netflix gaming. Um, and a lot of it went down

722
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:08,620
in Poland, uh, believe it or not because that is Netflix is basically their testing region for

723
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:15,100
this. So what happened in Poland? Um, well, starting this week, uh, Netflix members in Poland

724
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:21,420
are able to try Netflix mobile gaming. Um, it's only on Android, uh, for their test for whatever

725
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:29,100
reason. Um, and there's two games for it. Stranger things, 1984 and stranger things three, uh,

726
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,780
stranger things three, of course, is that RPG. I think if I remember right, stranger things,

727
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:41,660
1984 is a not great puzzle game. Um, but it's, it's, uh, it's part of the stranger things,

728
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,740
you know, licenses or whatever. So these are the two games that are a part of the test.

729
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,780
So if you're a Netflix member in Poland, you can check these out on your Android device as part of

730
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:56,620
the membership. Uh, Netflix did say, uh, it's still very, very early days and we will be working

731
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:01,660
hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app

732
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:07,100
purchases approach to gaming. Interesting that they also emphasize those points. Um,

733
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:14,300
just as the infrastructure to do that. So, you know, well, we'll brag about it as a positive

734
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:19,500
justice and FYI, you do not stream these games through the cloud. That's not what this does.

735
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:25,020
And this probably is may explain why it isn't currently testing on the Apple side of things.

736
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:29,180
I would guess I don't, I don't, I can only really speculate there. It's not through cloud gaming.

737
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:34,620
What you do when you installed now, uh, you go to the Google play store cause it's Android and

738
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,340
you download the game on the device. Uh, you can also download the game directly from the play

739
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:44,540
store, but you have to use your Netflix login as your credentials. So you can then play the games

740
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:50,300
through the Netflix app or their own dedicated app. Hmm. Now they, now Netflix does say an iOS

741
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:55,820
test is coming. So that is, you know, they're not leaving it out. Uh, and then, um, yeah. So,

742
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:00,220
but then we don't know exactly how that will work. Uh, yet if it downloads to the app store,

743
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:06,540
what we'll find out more when the test gets there. Um, but Netflix is using stranger things as part

744
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:12,460
of their gaming service test. So not, um, a terrible, terrible, big surprise when we talk

745
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:18,380
about some of the content shifting around. I still don't think they needed to do it. Um,

746
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,580
like you kind of said earlier, Sonic shows up in all these fan things and,

747
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,580
you know, it's Mario and Sonic at the Olympics. And I don't think it hurts

748
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:32,780
sales or brand identity that move or that movie still did very, very well when it came out.

749
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:38,380
So, um, I'm not sure I see the logic as to why they need to remove stranger things from dead

750
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:43,980
by daylight, other than. They just don't want to, it's not worth it to them or whatever. It's,

751
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:47,260
it's a little weird, but I guess they're within their rights.

752
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,700
Well, they're, they're also not really that like sought out of, you know, to,

753
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:55,260
I'm not like seeking it out to play. And they're also available. Like I think

754
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,020
some of that's already on like the steam storefront or Epic games and stuff like that.

755
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:04,540
So it's, it's other places like, I'm not gonna be like, Oh my God, it's gone from games path.

756
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:09,900
I better go check this out in Netflix. No one's thinking that at all. So whatever,

757
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:15,580
not these games, but it'll be interesting if Netflix comes up with originals and who knows,

758
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:21,260
maybe they have their own dead by daylight clone kind of game. We'll say, uh, uh, we'll say, um,

759
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:27,820
lopsided four V one kind of game that maybe we'll use the, then it'll make more sense to me why they

760
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:32,700
wanted to pull back from dead by daylight. Even though, again, if you bought those characters,

761
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,460
you keep those care, you're going to still see those characters in dead by daylight.

762
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,700
I wonder if they'll be like for the record, it's just stranger things stuff.

763
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:47,340
What's that Jamie? For the record. I think that the DLC cosmetics are the vector cosmetics

764
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:54,460
are going off sale before like a few days before the whole thing actually is gone.

765
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:02,300
Yep. Um, as to show 100, Matt, why you can. SSU 100, Matt, with a good perspective here saying

766
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:07,900
Netflix survived by taking a chance on streaming and making their own content. That is true.

767
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:12,380
Um, you know, Netflix really started the ball with making their own stuff. Like when

768
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,220
orange is the new black, I think was one of the first shows that I can remember being a Netflix

769
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,940
original. And there was a huge fucking deal when that came out that, and, uh, the one that

770
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:26,220
unfortunately had Kevin Spacey and that whole mess tank, that whole show, that was another early

771
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:29,420
Netflix original camera. What the fuck the show was called. Somebody in shadow will remember,

772
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:33,500
I'm sure, but those were like some early, early Netflix originals and the quality of those shows

773
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,340
was so good. At least the early seasons of orange is new black was pretty good. I don't know about

774
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:42,860
the later ones, but you know, it drew people into the streaming service house of cards. Thank you.

775
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:48,220
That was the other one I was trying to think of with the Kevin Spacey. All right. Um, and then,

776
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,580
then they like wrote them out of the very last season or something like that. I remember that

777
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:57,260
was a, a whole thing. So, um, yeah. And then, uh, as 200, Matt says just to test venture with one

778
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:04,220
of their own IPS. So it's nothing to lose. I think it'll go beyond their own IPS eventually. Um,

779
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:09,900
but we'll, we'll stay tuned for that. So, and pod culture says orange is the new black had

780
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,380
capable group from Voyager. Yes. That was a reason reason why I watched it actually is that I love

781
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,780
Kate Mulgrew and she plays a very different type of character in that show. So, uh, yeah.

782
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:24,620
And then I, I grew to like a lot of the other characters, except the main character hated her,

783
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,460
but everybody else was great, but I hated the main character in that show.

784
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,500
I don't even remember her name, but I hated her. All right. Well, she's not great in,

785
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:38,460
um, the Handmaid's Tale either, but you know, she in that show too. Well, I don't have a

786
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:43,340
problem with the actor. So I just had a problem with the character. Yeah. All right. All right.

787
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:47,980
My depth and chat says we all did Rob Robert. Okay. They, I'm glad to know I wasn't alone. All

788
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:56,700
right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, dark Sakura. Uh, what do we have next? Um, a move that's

789
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:04,780
honestly, I think just a gesture, but, um, for people who enjoy Overwatch,

790
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:12,140
there is a change coming by renaming the character McCree, who is named after, uh, the,

791
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:18,380
one of the developers who was let go from the company with all of the sexual harassment claims

792
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:26,380
going on. Um, it's a nice gesture, but that's all it is, is a gesture. It doesn't address.

793
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:31,180
I mean, yeah. Remove them. I say remove all references. That's great. That that's good.

794
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:43,020
But yeah, but they, uh, we're also planning on doing, um, a new narrative, uh, in Overwatch

795
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:48,460
in September, but because that character was involved in it, they're delaying it for later

796
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:56,300
in the year. And in the interim are doing a new FFA map, but I'm going to read the direct quote

797
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:02,780
from the development team. Sure. Um, we built the Overwatch universe around the idea of inclusivity

798
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:09,420
equity and the hope, uh, and hope are the building blocks of a better future. We continue to discuss

799
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,660
how we best live up to our values and to demonstrate our commitment to creating a game

800
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,940
world that reflects them. We believe it's necessary to change the name of the hero currently

801
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:22,700
known as McCree to something that better represents what Overwatch stands for.

802
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,220
And if fortunately the name that they chose was Cosby, the cowboy, and it's just not working out,

803
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:34,220
top it, delete your account. Stop it. They need to call him. Uh, I look like Wolverine, but not

804
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:41,500
really. I think I saw some name that was the Yee-Haw McGraw or something like that. Like just

805
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:49,020
give them a real over the top name. All right. Um, Mike Defton chat says, yeah, another nice

806
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,380
gesture, but at the same time, it's like, how does this fix things? And I definitely,

807
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:59,500
um, see that side of it. Um, because I just want to remind everybody it has been one month

808
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,220
now since the employees made demands of the leadership at Activision Blizzard King,

809
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:10,620
sometimes known as ABK. And those demands have still gone unheard from by the way,

810
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:16,220
Francis Townsend still employed at ABK for some reason, not sure what that reason is,

811
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:21,020
but that is, uh, something that should be noted has been one month and that those, uh, demands

812
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:26,060
have not been responded to. So they're pulling it. They're pulling a new Orleans. What do you

813
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:35,980
mean by that? Little bitty patches on those, uh, levees, but the storm hits and they break.

814
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:42,300
That may not be the best time to reference with what's going on. No, actually I did it on purpose

815
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:50,460
because I know those situations very well. I grew up in that general area and I'm very

816
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:56,860
pissed at new Orleans for not still having done the proper repairs on it. So I stand by my

817
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:03,500
statement. All right. Um, that's 200 Matt and chat says kind of like, Hey, I know we've been

818
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:08,380
shitty lately, but here is a semi warm cookie. It may or may not have chocolate chips might be

819
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:17,580
oatmeal. Oh, it might be raisins. I hate that. We are getting rid of the chocolate chips that,

820
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,220
uh, you know, the folks who are allergic to chocolate, uh, unfortunately we're replacing

821
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:28,780
them with raisins. Oh boy. All right. Uh, anyway, um, let's go in right into the next story because

822
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:35,980
it kind of ties into all of this. Right. Loki. Yeah, unfortunately. Um, so as we know, the,

823
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:42,940
um, California has been, you know, investigating Activision Blizzard for their, um, terrible work

824
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:50,380
place environment. And unfortunately there's also some more to that now. Um, so now we're

825
01:17:50,380 --> 01:18:00,140
getting allegations that, um, Activision Blizzard is shredding documents that were requested by,

826
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:10,220
um, the DFEH though. I don't know. That's, that's not good that we're hearing about that.

827
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:18,220
Um, yeah, basically that Activision Blizzard hasn't been cooperative, um, that they have

828
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:24,060
cited their, um, non-disclosure agreements and the requirements that employees must speak with

829
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:29,500
the company before contacting the state department. Um, there, um, of course, uh,

830
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:38,380
Wilmar Hale, who is, you know, busting unions and, um, other, uh, examples of lack of cooperation,

831
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:43,340
but yeah, the shredding documents tooth is also our shredding abuse evidence.

832
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:51,740
And, you know, basically, you know, it's not a good look for them, but of course,

833
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:56,220
Activision comes out and they're saying that, listen, we've done a lot. You know, we've,

834
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:01,100
we've, we've made several high-level personnel changes. We're revamping hiring and recruiting

835
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:07,420
practices and requiring diverse interview panels, greater transparency on pay equality

836
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:14,860
and clear boundaries on workspace behavior with a zero tolerance approach to harassment of their

837
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,780
actions that diminish or marginalized. So in other words, they may be saying

838
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,620
words, but it's not like an oral fart. That is exactly what I was going to say

839
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:29,180
is that their lips are moving, but all we hear is great minds think like us.

840
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:38,700
So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, this it's typical corporate, you know,

841
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,340
it sounds like that they're being as accountable about this as Ubisoft is.

842
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:50,060
So, um, meanwhile, SSJ 100 Matt is continuing the cookie company story going now it's like,

843
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:54,540
while you enjoy that cookie, pay no attention to the man shredding documents behind the curtains.

844
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,900
Pay no attention to the guy replacing your chocolate chips with raisins.

845
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:09,020
Evil fucking things. And I mean, both. I don't, I don't hate raisins,

846
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:15,100
but they ain't craisins, which are far superior. So I just want to make that clear.

847
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:22,220
I have a lot of love for craisins. Rob, what, what the cookie of choice is peanut butter,

848
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:27,340
which is fine. No, dark chocolate chip craisin oatmeal cookies.

849
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,020
Why would you put all of those things in a cookie together?

850
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:37,820
Because they're amazing. Okay, I don't know. See, I like I guess I guess chocolate and

851
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:42,460
craisin would go together. Okay. But at the same time, when you say the best cookie is,

852
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,300
I'm just going to say, Oh, peanut butter, like all those things.

853
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:51,660
They're Samoas. Oh yeah, Samoas are really good too. And snickerdoodles.

854
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:54,060
One last thing, one last thing on the cookie tangent.

855
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:58,060
Okay. One last cookie tangent. When I make black sesame cookies,

856
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,500
you have to have one. They're like little goth peanut butter cookies.

857
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
You gave them to me once. They're really good. I did?

858
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,420
Yeah. You brought them over. It was back when OLR. We were still doing it here and you,

859
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,940
brought them over one night. They're great. Yeah. My little goth cookies.

860
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:17,020
Yes. That turn my tongue black. Yeah. Those are awesome. I'll make them again.

861
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:26,140
All right. Awesome. Okay. Let's move on completely different topic. Although it does tie into some

862
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,860
activism things going on online. You might remember last week on the show, we talked

863
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,020
a little bit about the day off of Twitch. That's going to be happening on September 1st.

864
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:39,580
So a little reminder for folks that that is happening on September 1st. And many of your

865
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:44,860
favorite streamers will be participating, but at the same time, there are other streamers that

866
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:51,020
maybe cannot take the day off, whether it's due to their finances or the fact that they have a

867
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:55,500
contractual agreement with some company to play the game on that day. So I think everybody needs

868
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,300
to make their own decision and let other people make the decisions that are best for them.

869
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:06,540
Um, however, it is. So what's that? I said agreed. Oh yes. Um, however,

870
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:13,260
with that, um, you know, when we were talking about all that, I talked about how there really

871
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:19,900
isn't going to be pressure on Twitch until there is a competitor to Twitch. Now I'm not about to

872
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:26,220
talk about a competitor to Twitch directly, but this is fucking fascinating to me. So here it is

873
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:35,500
Streamlabs, who a lot of streamers use to, interestingly enough, do things that Twitch

874
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:43,020
can't do, right? So Streamlabs kind of adds things to the stream that Twitch doesn't natively do.

875
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:51,900
Well Streamlabs is also going to now be allowing streamers a way to make money, um, that is monthly

876
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:58,380
tipping. So it's a subscription, if you will, through Streamlabs. So yeah, I got an email

877
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:05,340
about that cause I already have, um, the direct ship, uh, tip jar. Yeah. Yeah. So now it's a way

878
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:13,820
for streamers to set up a subscription service and creators get 100% after PayPal takes their fees.

879
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:20,060
So it's going to be a lot different than the 50 50, um, down for this now, but here, here's the

880
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:24,380
thing. Uh, so, so the Streamlabs creator subscription, that's going to probably be more

881
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:30,540
appealing to people than Twitch's built-in service, but you should be aware. Remember

882
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:37,100
when you do the Twitch subs, you lose the ads and all that stuff. Streamlabs can't interface with

883
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:41,980
that. So if you're selling subs through this, Twitch is not going to treat these people like

884
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:46,140
Twitch subscribers because they're not Twitch subscribers. So any of those benefits that come

885
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:51,420
with a Twitch subscription, such as ad-free viewing or extra emotes or emotes at all,

886
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,260
um, that's not going to be available through this. So there is going to be a trade-off there. So I

887
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,180
just, I need to make that clear because I feel like that's an easy misconception when people

888
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:03,260
are reading about this and going, Oh, Streamlabs is competing with Twitch. Well, they're competing

889
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:07,900
on that amount of the money you get front, but they can't compete on that technical front because

890
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:17,180
Streamlabs isn't directly a Twitch competitor yet. That's me inserting that word. I have nothing

891
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:22,780
further to go off of, but I can't help but wonder. If Slots was worth actually freaking using,

892
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:30,220
then maybe. I can't help but wonder. Nah, I don't think so. They don't have the infrastructure for

893
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:34,380
it, but, um, it is cool that they're doing that. It sounds to me, it's almost like an

894
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:41,660
alternative to Patreon versus like, say, um, you know, what you would get with Twitch.

895
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:48,300
It's still something though that like they could basically try to, you know, say, Hey, you want to,

896
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,980
you know, contribute instead of like Patreon or something like that, you can do that through this

897
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:56,700
Streamlabs thing. And then it'll be all integrated within Twitch or something like that. Um, which is

898
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:01,900
kind of cool, I guess. Now, Tigerclaw brings up, um, in chat, there are many places to stream to

899
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,060
other than Twitch. Using a service like Restream, it gives you tons of places you can stream to

900
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:10,940
other than Twitch. True. There are two problems with that. Number one, when you are a Twitch

901
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:15,260
affiliate and you do decide to make money off Twitch, you're actually violating the terms with

902
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:21,420
Twitch to automatically Restream your content because you do, uh, say in that fine print that

903
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:26,380
and I, I a hundred percent realize people are not playing by the rules. They're doing that at their

904
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:33,100
own risk of peril. Okay. But like, for example, we don't simulcast to YouTube because it's part

905
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:39,180
of the agreement that we're on Twitch for a 24 hour period. And then we can, you know, if we

906
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:42,700
wanted to put a clip of the show on YouTube or whatever, we could do that. Um, I was also,

907
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:47,740
some of us are eventually trying to make partner. Yeah. So we absolutely don't want to ruin that.

908
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:52,940
I was also reminded when I talked about that there are no competitors to Twitch on last week's show,

909
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:58,940
I was reminded offline that Facebook gaming exists and I'm going to stand by what I

910
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:05,020
originally said on last week's show. There are no competitors to Twitch. Facebook gaming,

911
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:11,100
as far as I'm concerned is a non-factor and watch, I may have to eat my words in five years,

912
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:16,060
but if you allow Facebook to take over the gaming space, you people are fucking fools.

913
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:21,180
I said it, I said it, you know what? I know you're not supposed to say it,

914
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:28,460
but I cannot stand Facebook getting into this gaming space and all of these other things.

915
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:36,780
They can't keep misinformation and bullshit off their platform. I do not want that in the gaming

916
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:43,900
space. Period. So Facebook gaming, as far as I'm concerned is an illegitimate competitor.

917
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,580
It is not going to get a seat at the big kids table in my eyes.

918
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,180
If you disagree with me, that's fine. And I'm sorry to those that work very hard to

919
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:56,460
establish their Facebook gaming channels. I personally think you made a poor business decision.

920
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:05,740
So video games, they're lovely, aren't they? Yeah. I have a few.

921
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:16,780
Anyway. Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the people who got lured in by Facebook

922
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:20,780
gaming in the beginning served the length of their contract and went right back to Twitch.

923
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:27,340
Mike Deff says Facebook gaming is big in other countries though. Well, you know what? Friendster

924
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,060
was big in other countries for a very long time. And that's no, look, that's no disrespect. I'm not

925
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:36,780
trying to disrespect that, but I'm just saying, you know, people will gravitate towards one space

926
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:40,060
and my thoughts when it comes to Facebook gaming is still the same. I don't care what country

927
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:45,500
you're in. Facebook has no business getting in that space. Yeah. Mike Deff says so many

928
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:51,260
people in Mexico don't know what Twitch is and that, but that's on Twitch to some extent there.

929
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:56,380
Yeah. Bobby Black Wolf points out live journal is still big in Russia. I have a huge spot in my

930
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:00,780
heart for live journal. I met my husband on live journal. I met Dark Soccer and Loki pretty much

931
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:05,180
on live. Even if we didn't meet, I may not have met them on live journal, but our friendship was

932
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:09,100
strengthened by live journal, I think is a nice way to put it. You know, in the community that

933
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:13,500
was there. Do I give a shit about live journal in its current form? Absolutely not. Although,

934
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,380
oh no, they didn't. It's fun to look at once in a great while. They got some good gifts.

935
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:24,380
So that's it, you know? Yeah. And Bobby Black Wolf brings up that story about there's apparently

936
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:29,740
a new young adult novel about a kid trying to find out who her mom is by finding her dad's

937
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:36,780
live journal. Wow. And usually, usually I read these tips after the show, but I have to

938
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:43,020
acknowledge She-Hulk 10 donating 100 biddies. Thank you very much. But it's the comment for me

939
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:49,980
where it says Pornhub gaming would be fun. Honestly, She-Hulk honestly, honestly,

940
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:53,820
I'm very surprised they haven't tried to enter the space.

941
01:28:53,820 --> 01:29:02,940
Hmm. Maybe not directly, but Pornhub's got its subsidiaries and Loki, you just said, you know,

942
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,220
the stream labs can't get into the space because they don't have the infrastructure for it. Well,

943
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:14,940
Streamlabs, meet Pornhub. Pornhub, meet Streamlabs. Now kiss.

944
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,460
Yeah, I can see that.

945
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:26,620
Streamhub. Perfect. Thank you, Orange Right. Streamhub, Pornlabs. Probably not. I think

946
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:31,340
Orange Right might have the better name there, PodCulture, for what they're trying to put on

947
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:39,340
this space. But yeah. Anyway. Bobby Black Wolf points out there's already a triple X game

948
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:43,180
streaming site, or at least there was. Yeah, again, a lot. And I'm well aware there are

949
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:47,500
other competitors out there too, and I don't mean to shit on any of them, except for one that I've

950
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:53,420
already named. But some of these other ones that are like the up and comers, that's just,

951
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:58,460
they're up and comers. And I stress this on last week's show, I don't want to repeat myself too

952
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:04,860
much, but just the whole fact that they don't have that path to make money easily laid out the way

953
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:10,060
that Amazon backed Twitch has right now, which is why people are still, when people just say,

954
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:14,380
we'll go to a different platform. People are like, no, this is our platform. This is where

955
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,300
we've established our community. This is where I'm going to fight to make work, which is what

956
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,460
Dark Soccer is also referencing there. In spite of all this, I'm going to make partner on this

957
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:29,420
website, and we're going to work with what we've got. Yeah, VG Realness in chat says,

958
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:33,900
Pornhub has the infrastructure to take out YouTube and Twitch, and they're sleeping on it.

959
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:42,460
I 100% agree, VG Realness, and I'm wondering what it's going to take for them to get into that world.

960
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:48,460
Probably the whole content management stuff, because right now they don't have good

961
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:53,260
relationships, I think, with their payment processors because the whole issue with the

962
01:30:55,340 --> 01:31:00,940
stolen content and all that stuff. So if they can't manage that in just the platforms that

963
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:09,580
they have now, then why add to that? Plus they own several, they own so many streaming sites

964
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:16,060
outside of just the Pornhub stuff. They pretty much own the whole thing,

965
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:21,820
like all of the streaming services. It's ridiculous. Like RedTube, is that them too?

966
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:29,980
There's one that's shutting down at the end of the month or next month that is very similar,

967
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:34,620
but it must not be part of Pornhub if it's closing. It's XXX something.

968
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:39,580
They've got the RedTube, Tube8, Thumbzilla, they have so many.

969
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,020
I'm sorry, did you say Tube8?

970
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,500
Yeah, Tube8.

971
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,980
Okay. All right.

972
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:49,180
It's like six different sites, so it's just ridiculous.

973
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:54,460
Interesting. All right. Enough talk about Pornhub, but I couldn't help but talk about

974
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:59,740
that with the streamers. So anyway, I didn't get to this, but I will say Streamlabs,

975
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:07,500
also keep in mind the tipping can be integrated into OBS, and OBS allows you to go to YouTube,

976
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:12,060
if you want, Facebook, TikTok. I didn't even know you could stream to TikTok.

977
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,780
Yeah, there's actually a guy I watch who does Minecraft. He does live streaming from TikTok

978
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,220
and Twitch simultaneously.

979
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:25,820
Well, maybe TikTok is I in this space too. I don't know. Anyway, Streamlabs lets creators

980
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:31,180
decide what they're basically selling with their subscription and set the price point on that.

981
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:35,420
There's also going to be leaderboards, badges, and all that fun stuff there. But again,

982
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:39,180
I can't stress this enough. It is outside of Twitch, so it's not going to disable some of

983
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:43,020
those things that Twitch does with their subscriptions. So keep that in mind when

984
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,540
you're weighing all these different options.

985
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:49,420
Well, I mean, they were talking about putting ads on people that subscribe to the channels too,

986
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:53,980
haven't they? So who knows what's outside of Twitch at this point?

987
01:32:54,700 --> 01:33:00,620
Well, they better not until they fix some of the bullshit that Dark Sakura can speak to firsthand,

988
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,420
because I know you had to deal with that bullshit in this past week.

989
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:12,700
So until they fix that shit, that's like still actively happening. I really would not do things

990
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:18,860
to make people further teeter on the edge of leaving this site. So, all right.

991
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:27,740
Anyhow, let's go back to a simpler time when we didn't stream games in our next segment.

992
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:44,140
Now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a

993
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,780
classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

994
01:33:52,700 --> 01:34:03,420
I picked Picross DS. It is a puzzle game that was developed by Jupiter and published by

995
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:12,380
Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is the second Picross game to be released. The first one

996
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:21,420
was Mario's Picross, but it failed outside of Japan. There were a bunch more Picross games

997
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:33,180
in Japan, but this one apparently did a bit better. So basically you have different

998
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:43,420
nonogram logic puzzles. With this is that you have to mark each square as full or empty,

999
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:48,700
and it eventually reveals what the picture is. You can also create your own puzzles,

1000
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:53,420
send them to other people, download some classic puzzles, speed competitions using the Nintendo

1001
01:34:53,420 --> 01:35:02,860
Wi-Fi connection. Or you also have a daily and online challenge mode where you receive a hint

1002
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:08,380
that reveals one randomly selected row and column. It doesn't affect your player time,

1003
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:14,380
and three different kinds of background music can be selected except in classic puzzle mode

1004
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,540
and the unlockable extra 11 extra puzzles. Or you can turn the music off.

1005
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:24,220
So you do have different modes. And by the way, the only one I could find without someone talking

1006
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:37,180
over it was a speedrun. But anyway, in normal mode, you get told to mark a square that should

1007
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:44,620
be unmarked. If your first mistake happens, you get a penalty of two minutes. The second,

1008
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:48,860
four, and each of the following mistake, eight minutes. You can choose from an easy mode that's

1009
01:35:48,860 --> 01:36:00,620
five by five or 10 by 10 puzzles. It can go up to 25 by 20. So you have all kinds of just different

1010
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:07,820
things that you do. So you have different timed mini games. You can also unlock one called catch

1011
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:12,700
where one by one squares float around the grid and you have to tap them to clear the mode or sketch

1012
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,980
where the top screen displays a picture and you have to copy it on the bottom screen.

1013
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:21,340
And then there's also hit where you hit squares and make them disappeared once you have a certain

1014
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:29,500
number tap mode is cleared. Your music choices are jazz, reggae, and bossa nova. You also have

1015
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:33,820
free mode. If you're not told when you make a mistake, they just get harder and harder to

1016
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:38,540
complete. You also have the mini games, but they're more difficult in free mode.

1017
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:43,980
And then in free mode, you get rock house and ambient for your music choices.

1018
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:56,540
So the game actually, with this one, it got a reading of 9.4 out of 10 by one reviewer. And it

1019
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:06,700
was basically ranked fairly high for a P-Cross game to be released since Mario's P-Cross.

1020
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:13,980
Mario's P-Cross, it did get some pretty favorable reviews, but this one topped it.

1021
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:21,180
And so, I just picked a little game. It's something that maybe not a lot of people

1022
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:28,140
have a lot of experience in that maybe it's something unique and different.

1023
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:33,740
What's that game that Bobby had talked about before, Murder by Numbers or something?

1024
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:40,220
But that's kind of like this too. It's a P-Cross game.

1025
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:45,260
And me personally, I'm not the biggest fan of P-Cross,

1026
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:52,300
but it is a fun little time sink from time to time. Much better than a Minesweeper.

1027
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:58,220
There you go. Now, one thing I will say about the P-Cross,

1028
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:02,940
because you mentioned it kind of in the beginning and you just brought it up again as Mario P-Cross,

1029
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:09,020
that is one of the games that's on the Nintendo Switch library. They added it a little later.

1030
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:15,340
It wasn't in the initial set. So people might not realize it's there, but if you want to sample a

1031
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:20,780
P-Cross game, that's a great place to start. Because obviously the DS games are a little

1032
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:25,660
harder to play now just because they don't really sell them for the Switch or anything.

1033
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:30,300
I mean, you can find a used copy at your local Game Flop or whatever, but

1034
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:35,420
I still think Mario P-Cross is worth a look. It's still quite good.

1035
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:41,500
Well, at any rate, there were other versions. Of course, Mario's P-Cross came out before that.

1036
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:49,580
Afterwards, Nintendo and HAL Laboratory did P-Cross 3D. There's also Essential Sudoku DS,

1037
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:55,420
which has, I guess, a P-Cross mode and P-Cross E, which is Jupiter's other follow-up for Nintendo

1038
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:07,260
3DS. But basically, P-Cross is based off of the concept of nonograms, which are logic puzzles

1039
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:12,220
that require you fill in the right things based on numbers. Yep. So you can actually find nonograms

1040
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:20,700
in those penny press puzzle magazines and things like that. Yeah. So there you go. There it is,

1041
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:26,620
your classic game of the week, P-Cross DS on the Nintendo DS. Great, great shout out.

1042
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:31,820
Bobby Blackall pointing out, I got into it, meaning P-Cross, with the Pokemon P-Cross

1043
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:36,300
free-to-play game on 3DS. Yeah. Yeah. I think that might've been the first one I played too.

1044
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:41,500
There was a Zelda one as well, I remember, that was really good. So check that out. I don't know

1045
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,780
if that one was free. I can't remember. Bobby Blackall also points out there's a billion

1046
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:49,500
nonogram apps out there. Absolutely. They're not called P-Cross, but they might be called

1047
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:55,340
Picture-Cross or something like that. So there's other ones. So very cool. All right. Great pick.

1048
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,900
I got to talk about this. So ready for a food tangent, everybody?

1049
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:05,980
So I had no idea that these were things that existed, but you know that grandpa Matt or

1050
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:09,740
captain Matt, depending on if you listen to Hoard House or Starboard Power Coupling when

1051
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:13,900
those shows were around, for those of you that know him, he likes to send me all the pumpkin

1052
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:19,340
shit in the entire world. I was wondering if that happened yet. Well, okay. So here's what happened.

1053
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:25,980
I ordered some more masks for Dragon Con because I wanted to refresh my collection a little bit.

1054
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:31,500
So I ordered some more mass at Amazon. A certain package got here first and I opened it and I was,

1055
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:39,180
what the hell is this? And it was a bag of pumpkin pie Kit Kats is what showed up. And it is part of

1056
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:47,980
grandpa Matt's pumpkin thing he does. The pumpkin spice lattes are back and they are fabulous as

1057
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:53,660
always. However, with as much shit as I get for liking pumpkin and being called basic and all

1058
01:40:53,660 --> 01:41:00,380
that stuff, I want to point out, they also rolled out an apple drink, that apple macchiato. I told

1059
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:06,300
you this was coming out. It's pretty fucking good. That's what I hear, except I hate caramel. Is the

1060
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:10,300
caramel flavor strong? Just order it without it. Cause I think it's the drizzle they put on top.

1061
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:19,580
Yeah. Like I was told to try the apple syrup in a chai. Yes. And I think they do a frat with it

1062
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:23,260
as well. And I haven't, I haven't tried either that, but yeah, the apple is a standalone syrup.

1063
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:28,620
So I'm probably going to be giving that a go tomorrow. Well, I normally do my pink drink

1064
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:32,140
cause it's one of the things that doesn't make me sick. Oh yeah. I like the pink drinks too,

1065
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:40,620
but I, I really want to try the apple in a, in a chai. So Renee Yasiner chat, hi,

1066
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:45,660
it's so good to see you. Uh, says, uh, pumpkin pie and then I'm a slut for their apple drinks.

1067
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:50,780
I mean, same TBH, like with as much shit as I get for the pumpkin thing, I will do a lot for

1068
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:58,780
an apple drink as well. They are quite tasty. So say that. I am not finding a pumpkin spice, uh,

1069
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:04,540
Reese's on a, you probably need to give it a few more weeks. It is still early in the pumpkin

1070
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:09,980
season. I am used to the pumpkin spice latte coming out the day I leave for dragon con. So

1071
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:14,140
I feel like it was a whole week early this year than usual, but yeah. So anyway, I'm going to

1072
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:18,460
enjoy one of these pumpkin pie kit cats, which are quite tasty. You know what they taste like

1073
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:24,620
pumpkin pie. Um, and it's good cause the, the wafer kind of kit cats. I love had those before.

1074
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:28,300
They're good. Japanese ones are better. Pod culture says there's an apple mountain

1075
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,380
dew coming out. That sounds like it might be pretty tasty. Anyway. Yeah. I've had the,

1076
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:37,740
I've had the pumpkin pie ones before and I honestly truly believe that the Japanese,

1077
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:44,380
a couple of Joe ones were a lot better. There's some great flavors in Japan. I'm excited that

1078
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:51,180
we're finally getting some of that shit in the U S and it only took like 50 flavors of Oreos

1079
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:56,700
for other companies to catch on that like, Hey, people like wacky zany flavors. So there was

1080
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:03,180
another flavor that's out that I think that you would like Rob banana caramel. I love banana.

1081
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:10,220
Heck yeah. They do have a banana like us when they're doing in the U S but one of the current

1082
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:14,860
Japanese flavors is banana caramel. And if I find it, I'll get you some. Yeah. A pod culture says

1083
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:18,540
there was a key lime kit cat. That was awesome. Yeah. The key that that was something that was

1084
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:24,220
around. Those are pretty good. There's a mint one. There was, um, some other flavor. I kind

1085
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:30,220
of dig the duos. Yeah. The mint and the mocha ones. Yeah. Anyway. All right. Enough food. Yeah. I

1086
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:35,180
know back to video games, but Hey, you know what? I snack on a lot of Kit Kat bars. Well, I mean,

1087
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:39,580
well not, not too many, but enough. Oh, I'm playing video games. So let's travel around

1088
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:43,660
the world and quickly talk about some other things going on in the gaming world. Uh, Loki,

1089
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:49,820
we'll start with you. Loki. I think you're muted, which will explain why I heard you say

1090
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:54,140
not a thing about Kit Kats, which is unfortunate, but that's all right. I don't really like Kit Kat.

1091
01:43:54,140 --> 01:44:00,460
They're okay. Yes. Yeah. So, um, we talked a little bit about April and Neil coming to

1092
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:06,220
the new Ninja turtles game. Um, but she's also going to be coming to another game,

1093
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:13,580
Nickelodeon all-star brawl. So we have April Neil coming to that game as well as a fighting game

1094
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:20,620
character and then cat dog also coming to that game as well. It's a really shaping up to be a

1095
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:26,060
pretty awesome game. So now I'm not hearing Lori Beth Denberg, but, or moose from, you can't do

1096
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:30,300
that on television. I'm not hearing these Nickelodeon things yet, but it's still time.

1097
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:36,060
There's still time. Yeah. So I never really watched cat dog, but like,

1098
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:39,260
it is cool to see all these other characters coming to the game. So

1099
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:46,540
I mean, let's keep you coming. I want to hear about all the characters and DLC and all this

1100
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:53,660
fun stuff. And then along with that, uh, the Lego star Wars Skywalker saga was something that they

1101
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:59,180
were showing off during games com and it is coming out next year. Now sometime in, uh, spring

1102
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:04,700
of 2022 is when they announced that they had a new trailer for that. Um, you know, it looks cool. I'm

1103
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:08,860
not, I never really played the Lego star Wars games. It was more of the Lego Marvel stuff, but

1104
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:17,900
I have to check it out. All right. Dark soccer. What do you have for us? Um, there is a final

1105
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:25,500
fantasy four pixel remaster, uh, coming out for, uh, computers and for mobile. Um,

1106
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:32,300
on it looks like September 8th, it looks pretty cool. I definitely, uh, I'm considering that one

1107
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:40,060
because I love it. I love, and then I'm sorry. I love four. I hate that font in the remasters,

1108
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:44,860
but I might just have to suck it up and deal with it. I did hear through the grapevine just random

1109
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:49,260
that you spoonie barred is still intact in the final fantasy four, uh, pixel remaster,

1110
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:57,100
which is the most important part of the game. It must be. So at any rate, um, also horizon

1111
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:03,980
forbidden West has been officially delayed until 2022. Uh, the date they are listing now is

1112
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:09,900
February 18th. There are starting orders for it though. So there's that. Nice. What's their,

1113
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,380
their game then coming out this fall? Like what Sony got other than the horizon?

1114
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:21,260
I don't think there is one flatulence. Uh, I, I think they're relying on third party and just

1115
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:26,620
the, you know, the system did very well last year. Um, I mean, with as many of them as you

1116
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:30,700
could find. Um, so I kind of think they're just trying to ride that wave until, uh,

1117
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:36,380
I mean, if you want to be technical final fantasy 14 and Walker is a PlayStation five title,

1118
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:40,140
and that's something that Xbox doesn't have, but of course it's on PC as we all know,

1119
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:47,180
but technically that is a holiday title. So that's all I got. All right. Well,

1120
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:51,500
I guess that's fine. There's no systems to be had. So, you know, why,

1121
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:58,460
why bother putting out games to sell the system? All right. Uh, and some of the folks in chat are,

1122
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:03,260
um, giving me tips on my font issue with final fantasy, uh, the pixel remasters,

1123
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:07,980
my fifth dream says it's easily moddable and dark Tetsuya says you can swap the font for the

1124
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:12,460
one in the Japanese language version. It's much better now. That's I'm, I'm interested in that.

1125
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,580
So I'll have to look up how to do that. I think I will finally, you know, suck it up and buy at

1126
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:21,420
least the first game just to see what they're like and then make a decision from there. If,

1127
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,260
if it's going to be worth it for the really the holy Trinity of four or five and six, let's be

1128
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,980
real. Um, two and three are okay, but they're not four or five and six. Let's be honest. All right.

1129
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:34,940
Um, okay. I think that was it for rapid fire news. So let's travel around the world and check

1130
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:40,540
out some release dates, things coming a little sooner than, uh, well, I guess not that much

1131
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:45,180
sooner than the final fantasy four pixel remaster sooner than the final fantasy six pixel remaster.

1132
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:51,580
What's coming out next week. So we got a game called lake. That's going to be on PC and Xbox

1133
01:47:51,580 --> 01:48:00,140
one, uh, bravely default two on PC, uh, demon gaze extra on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four.

1134
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:06,620
We have a Kataria fables on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,

1135
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:13,900
Xbox one and Xbox series X, WRC 10 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one,

1136
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:21,580
Xbox series X, big rumble boxing, creed champions on PC, Nintendo switch,

1137
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:28,060
PlayStation four and Xbox one. Uh, we have the medium coming out on PlayStation five

1138
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:35,180
and that's it. I didn't realize the medium wasn't staying an Xbox exclusive. I thought that was a

1139
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:40,460
exclusive. I guess I was wrong. It's not. All right. So I guess it was, or it was one of those

1140
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:45,020
limited windows or something. All right. Uh, traveling to Japan, uh, checking out the Nintendo

1141
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:49,820
switch this week, demon gaze extra in a regular and limited edition is out in Japan this week on

1142
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:56,300
the Nintendo switch as is port Royal four, uh, and then big rubble boxing creed champions is out there

1143
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:01,020
as well. Uh, and that is pretty much all the releases on the switch. However, peaking at the

1144
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:07,660
PlayStation five, uh, we have that same port Royal four game is out there as well. And sadly, we

1145
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:12,060
don't really start to pick up releases. I'll just read this one for September 9th. Cause this is

1146
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,380
kind of a big deal. Tales of arise is out on the PlayStation five. And I kind of think that's the

1147
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:21,420
big tent pole release, but that'll be in the week that we're off. So, um, that is something to look

1148
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:26,460
forward to for sure. Uh, dark soccer. How about the UK? I'm going to do the two weeks worth.

1149
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:35,020
Sure. So we have, um, on the 31st forgotten city, uh, we have rustler and we have Kiwi,

1150
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:41,740
I guess that's how it's pronounced. Um, and then it's K E Y W E which it looks like they're little

1151
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:49,580
Kiwi birds. So, um, then in September on the second, we have WRC 10, we have Arashi castles

1152
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:58,780
of sin, the medium, Kitaria fables, Rico London, um, monster harvest. And then on the seventh,

1153
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:03,980
we have bus simulator, 21 Chernobyl light on the 10th, also on the 10th.

1154
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:10,140
Why are you aware? Get it together. Big rumble boxing, creed championships, family trainer,

1155
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:19,580
NBA two K 22 tales of arise. And that's, uh, that's it. Um, Loki, since Jamie and I did it,

1156
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:23,260
did you want to circle back to the U S and talk about, um, the week that we're off? Cause I get,

1157
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:27,260
I think that tales of rise of Wario aware in that week, those are pretty big releases.

1158
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:32,220
Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, for the week of the seventh, we've got, uh, Chernobyl, but,

1159
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:39,980
or yeah, Chernobyl light on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, fist forged in shadow torch,

1160
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:46,620
uh, that is on PC PlayStation born PlayStation five sonic colors, ultimate on PC,

1161
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:52,300
Nintendo switch PlayStation born Xbox one, uh, the art full escape on PC,

1162
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:59,980
Xbox one and Xbox series X toy soldiers, HD on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one

1163
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:05,900
life is strange. True colors on PC and, uh, PlayStation four PlayStation five,

1164
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:12,860
Xbox one, Xbox series X and stadia. We have a Lawson random that's on PC,

1165
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:20,540
Nintendo switch PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, NBA two K 22 on PC,

1166
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:26,620
Nintendo switch PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, uh, tales of

1167
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:33,020
rise on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X. And last but not least,

1168
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:37,420
why are you aware? Get it together on Nintendo switch. All right. I'm glad we covered that

1169
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:41,340
week. Cause that's a huge week. I forget the week after labor day tends to always be a big

1170
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:45,580
week for some reason. So it's kind of like the kickoff of the holiday season. It's as weird as

1171
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:49,660
it is to say that I really feel like that first week of September is when you really start to see

1172
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:54,460
the releases start to amp up a little bit towards, um, black Friday. It's basically like between

1173
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:58,860
labor day and black Friday are all your big game releases of the year. Well, not all, but a good,

1174
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:03,580
probably 75%. Well, it's like the start of the fourth quarter stuff. So yeah, that too, that too.

1175
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:08,940
So, all right. Uh, there you go for the world release dates. Let's get back into some other

1176
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:14,060
gaming news and then we're going to get to, uh, the listener round table, which, uh, remember we

1177
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:18,540
are taking calls on discord again, so you can join our green room over at vog network.com slash

1178
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:23,580
discord, if you want to call into the show tonight. Um, but you also, um, can, uh, speak

1179
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:27,900
up in our chat room and then we'll see if we have any emails this week over at participate

1180
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:35,740
at orange launch radio.com. But first more news Loki. Yeah. So South Korea is abolishing their,

1181
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:43,100
uh, gaming shutdown law. So the shutdown law banned children under the age of 16 years old

1182
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:49,580
from playing video games between, uh, 12 midnight and 6.00 AM in the morning, I guess, to help them

1183
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:55,820
in school or something like that. Um, and apparently companies could be fined if they allowed,

1184
01:52:55,820 --> 01:53:01,180
uh, players to be able to do that. They were fitting that age range. So now they are going

1185
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:06,380
to be getting rid of that and says for use games are often important, leisurely activities and

1186
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:11,740
communication channel. I hope that the preventative measures can respect the rights of the youth

1187
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:19,340
and encourage a healthy home education. So, um, they're going to basically allow them to be

1188
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:24,620
protected through a choice system, which allows parents and their legal guardians to be able to,

1189
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:30,380
uh, permit and regulate the number of hours. So putting in the power or giving it to the, uh,

1190
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:35,740
families to regulate that, which makes sense. I mean, if you have like, you know, kids, maybe they

1191
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,860
stay up late on the weekends, they'll play that. I don't know if this is necessarily just during

1192
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:43,340
the week or if it's just every single day, but yeah, at least it's going away. So that

1193
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:48,540
makes it a lot easier for software companies as well. Yeah. I was like, I might know one adult

1194
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:55,180
in here who is playing no man's sky at 1 AM on Saturday morning. I mean, I'm an adult,

1195
01:53:55,180 --> 01:54:00,380
I'll do what I want. Um, but I, I also, I wonder if there's maybe some pandemic stuff that plays

1196
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:03,660
into that. I mean, I know these are younger kids, we're talking about like 16 and under,

1197
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:07,100
but I wonder if there's something about the whole, like, you know what they're staying indoors,

1198
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:11,100
playing video games, that's where we need kids to be right now. So I wonder if there's some of that

1199
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:18,540
playing into it too. Possibly. Um, well, speaking of pandemic related things or things that we tried

1200
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:25,580
to, uh, blame or, um, I guess pin on the pandemic, I want to go back to the Pokemon go controversy.

1201
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:30,220
So we talked a couple of weeks ago on the show about the, uh, controversy around the change of,

1202
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:34,860
uh, taking the stop, uh, radius spinning. So basically the radius that you have to be standing

1203
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:39,420
from a stop in order to be able to spin it, you may recall they increased that to 80 meters at

1204
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:43,740
the start of the pandemic. And a few weeks ago, they lowered that back to 40 meters, which

1205
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:49,260
basically pissed off a lot of the fans of the game that had gotten used to the 80 meter, 80 meter

1206
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:55,580
radius. Well, um, I'm going to admit this surprised me. Um, it came out this week in a tweet. Pokemon

1207
01:54:55,580 --> 01:55:01,100
go app said, uh, in a tweet trainers were looking forward to sharing our plans as a result of the

1208
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,540
task force on September 1st. Remember that they're going to, uh, they, they put together

1209
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:09,980
that task force of YouTubers and influencers to talk about all this stuff. Uh, but they continue

1210
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:15,740
in the tweet, but one thing does not have to wait from now on 80 meters will be the base interaction

1211
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:22,780
radius for pokey stops and gyms globally. So they did take that radius back to 80 meters. Uh, and I

1212
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:29,740
I'm assuming the crowd rejoiced, uh, on that end of things. Um, I'm sort of waiting for the other

1213
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:34,460
shoe to drop because they're still waiting. Like they're still saying we're going to announce the

1214
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:40,060
rest of the task force on September 1st. So I'm sort of waiting for that. And the radius is back

1215
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:47,100
to 80 meters, but we still got to make money off this game. You have to buy an 80 meter pass in

1216
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:51,500
order to know, cause they've already implemented it back in the game. So there's no 80 meter pass

1217
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:56,300
or anything like that, but I'm, I'm still waiting for the, but if you spin it more than five times

1218
01:55:56,300 --> 01:56:03,340
in an hour, congrats, all you're going to get are purple potions. Please enjoy them purple potions

1219
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:08,860
and, um, the banana thing. That's Nanab berries. That was a useless one. Yeah. That's all you're

1220
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:14,860
going to get from those stops. Um, still waiting to see what that is. Uh, going to our chat because

1221
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:19,500
I know two of our big Pokemon pals are in chat. S200. Matt says, I still don't believe this will

1222
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:25,180
be forever. Niantic really wanted to keep the 40 meter thing. I apparently they got talked into it.

1223
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:31,100
I actually feel like this 80 meter is going to stick, but there might be, I still think there's

1224
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:36,380
another side to the coin, but we'll see. Uh, Mike Defton chat says, yay for the radius increase,

1225
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:42,620
but we definitely need to say, see what they say on September 1st. Yes. Let's wait for the other.

1226
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:47,660
Let's keep the confetti cannons. Just store it away. You can ready them, but don't pull the

1227
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:53,740
trigger on the confetti cannons until we hear what else is changing about the game. Because we are,

1228
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:57,820
it already was data mined that we're going to do this stuff with like powering up pokey stops and

1229
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:03,900
things like that. I'm just, what is, what is, what is the other half of this? I'm waiting to see.

1230
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:09,180
We'll see. We'll see. All right. But I knew our Pokemon Go fans in the house would appreciate

1231
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:13,820
that. By the way, how many of you have been rating the new, uh, uh, Zacian and Zamzenta,

1232
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:19,660
the Galar region, the Pokemon sword and shield legendaries is so weird to see in Pokemon Go

1233
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:24,460
already. But, uh, I picked up one Zacian. I wish I'd done more. I didn't do enough of

1234
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:28,460
those raids because hello, you could transfer them to your sword and shield game through

1235
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:35,020
Pokemon home. Like the easiest way to get those legendaries. Gosh. So yeah. Um, I have a couple

1236
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:39,420
Zamzatas for now though, or if I'm even saying that right, I'm probably not, I'm probably missing

1237
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:46,860
an N or something, but anyway, uh, it's just weird. Uh, Mike Defton chat says, uh, I did my

1238
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:52,700
Pokedex registry and that's it. Uh, bonds 006 says Zamazenta. I got two of each. So there you

1239
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:58,700
go. Pod culture says I need one. So yeah, it's, uh, try to look for those raids in your area.

1240
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:03,100
See if there's a, here's, I guess where I'll recommend Facebook. See if you have a local

1241
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:07,820
Pokemon Go Facebook group in your area. You probably do. And there's probably a discord

1242
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:11,900
server for it too. And there's a lot of people that do raid organizing in those places. So it's

1243
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:14,940
probably the best way to find. And even if not, you can probably find like,

1244
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:20,140
even though Sacramento as a whole, you know, there's like a million people in the region.

1245
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:24,940
Sacramento as a whole uses discord with Pokemon Go community, but like the locals here like to

1246
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:29,180
use group me for some weird, it's like the worst of the messaging apps. I don't know why they like

1247
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:35,180
it, but they do. So, uh, that's where the locals are to look for raids. But I use, um, there's

1248
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:40,300
actually a network of Ingress players that also play Pokemon that use telegram to coordinate the

1249
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:45,020
remote raids. And that's what I use. That's how I got all those, uh, things that I have is, uh,

1250
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:51,260
using telegram looking for raids. So, uh, as Joe and her map points out pokey Raider. That's right.

1251
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:55,500
They've built all separate apps and websites for the remote raid stuff too. I always forget about

1252
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,900
that. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Moving on dark soccer. Let's get to this story, which I think is

1253
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:09,820
kind of neat. So, um, EA has, um, patented accessibility options that are free for all

1254
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:17,980
developers and publishers to use in their game, um, in their games. Um, so these various patents,

1255
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:24,540
um, as they've been shared are contextually aware communication systems and video games,

1256
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:31,420
um, which includes apex legends, uh, ping system, uh, systems and methods for automated

1257
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:36,620
image processing with images with similar luminosities. So those are for color vision

1258
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:44,700
deficiencies, uh, constant ratio detection and rendering system that allows, um, the system to

1259
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:51,580
automatically detect and update subpart contrast regions again for visibility and personalized

1260
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:59,100
real-time audio generation based on user physiological response. So basically, um, this

1261
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:09,020
wasn't developed by EA yet. It's just been patented. Um, but it would, uh, basically give,

1262
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:20,300
uh, clues based on how a player would hear. So they're, uh, really wanting to improve, uh,

1263
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:29,020
the ability of disabled people. I reckon to be able to play games and enjoy them as much

1264
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:34,540
as an abled person. Well, I think, you know, and I agree with our Tetsuya in our chat room.

1265
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:39,500
I know EA has done some scummy stuff in the past, but I can appreciate this. Yes, this is,

1266
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:45,660
you know, these types. Why patent it though, if they're not going to, I don't understand.

1267
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:49,660
They're making it available for other people. They may have it in development,

1268
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:55,740
but they want to have the patent down first. I guess they may have been worried. That's normal.

1269
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:59,980
Yeah. They may have worried someone else would patent it too, when they do want to include it

1270
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:04,620
in their own games. And they're trying to do that good guy, EA thing, especially. I mean,

1271
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:10,460
I don't want to think this is the case, but I worry it may be, especially when their biggest

1272
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:18,540
peers in the industry right now, EA, I'm sorry, Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft, like EA has kind

1273
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:23,900
of not been in that conversation. And I think that's where they prefer to be. Um,

1274
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:29,900
so I think these sort of public interests, doing a good thing, sorts of things are very good for

1275
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:35,260
EA right now. And they know it. Um, so again, I want to believe it's not tied to that and it

1276
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:41,980
is completely separate and independent and just, you know, good guy, EA. Um, I, I don't know that

1277
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:46,300
I a hundred percent put faith that there isn't some interesting timing going on with all this.

1278
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:56,380
Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's, it's a might suss yo. Yeah. Sus, I think is a good way to put

1279
02:01:56,380 --> 02:02:02,700
it. Um, regardless, let's try to focus on the end result, which is good thing. So, you know,

1280
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:08,780
sus or not the end result is a good thing. So, all right. Um, let's move on. Loki,

1281
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:14,700
let's go back to saints row, but, um, for good reason, uh, this is, I know this is very upsetting

1282
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:20,700
for many people in the community. Yes. So unfortunately, like right after we got the

1283
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:27,260
announcement of the super lackluster or scenes for a reboot trailer, um, we also got the

1284
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:33,420
announcement of one of the champions of saints row two, and it's basically a community developer

1285
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:39,660
that's been working on saints row two for the longest time with gentlemen of the row. He,

1286
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:47,580
he went by the name idle ninja. Well, his real name was Mike Watson. And while he was champions

1287
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:54,060
saints row and everything, he, um, a while back actually announced that he was battling stage

1288
02:02:54,060 --> 02:03:01,260
four cancer. And unfortunately he succumbed to that cancer around the same time as the

1289
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:08,620
announcement of the saints row reboot. Uh, he was actually solely working on saints row two and

1290
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:14,300
trying to, um, bring that game back to a playable state. Cause you may, I don't know if you knew,

1291
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:20,060
but the PC version of saints row two was horribly rushed and broken, like completely broken.

1292
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:26,140
Pretty sure you've bitched about it on this show. Yeah. So apparently, you know, he, he was able to,

1293
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:31,980
uh, work on that game and actually was able to recover the source code for the game to be able

1294
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:36,540
to actually, you know, do a lot of things for it. And so now there's lots of different mods for it

1295
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:40,860
and lots of patches, you know, the gentleman of the row was something that he had put out

1296
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:46,860
and, uh, worked on for a long time that made the game actually playable. And unfortunately now,

1297
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:52,540
you know, it's like kind of one of the last, you know, people that was really kind of behind the

1298
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:58,620
whole saints row series and kind of leading in the right direction. But, you know, it's unfortunate

1299
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:03,740
they had to pass away. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to hear that for, um, his family and, you know,

1300
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:10,700
all the community that, uh, appreciated his contributions, um, to the game. So, um, yeah,

1301
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:17,820
that's, uh, it's unfortunate. So, all right. Yeah. Well, to try to end things on a bit of a lighter

1302
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:24,060
positive note tonight, um, I thought we could take this on as our last, um, uh, slight slated story

1303
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:30,060
tonight, and that is a good old fashioned, make you feel old story. And you can probably read it

1304
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:34,060
right there on the sidebar. Oh, but if in the podcast, no, you can't read it. So let me tell

1305
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:39,900
you and inform you and give you your, your old moment. You ready? How old were you when the super

1306
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:48,380
Nintendo came out? Because add 30 to it and it's your age. Now the super Nintendo turned 30 years

1307
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:55,580
old this week. Uh, the super Nintendo, of course, uh, launched back in 1991,

1308
02:04:56,540 --> 02:05:00,780
if you can believe it. And I don't think it launched with a lot of games at the start. I know,

1309
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:07,740
um, uh, Oh, by the way, and I should point out the super Famicom came out in November, 1990,

1310
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:13,420
the U S launch was, uh, uh, in the last weekend of August, right before all the kids go back to

1311
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:23,820
school, uh, in 1991. And I believe the launch games were pilot wings, F zero and Mario world.

1312
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:29,020
And that was it, even though, even though some of the early trailers and some of the, you know,

1313
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:37,900
like, um, I didn't realize this, did you know, Paul Rudd, the ageless man behind Ant-Man and,

1314
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:43,820
uh, clueless the movie, you know, from, from very different decades, did you know Paul Rudd was in

1315
02:05:43,820 --> 02:05:49,420
that super early super Nintendo trailer? I didn't know that until I forgot it, I guess until this

1316
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:53,180
week. But in that first super Nintendo, you know, they show a little bit of pilot wings. They show

1317
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:58,140
a bit of Mario world, but they also show early footage from Zelda and some football game. I

1318
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:04,540
think, uh, um, not, not the big football game, uh, super high impact. I think it did. Maybe it was,

1319
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:08,780
I don't know. But anyway, um, they, they actually say in the trailer, these games are not out yet,

1320
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:14,380
but the other ones, you know, work as pilot wings was a launch game. Um, I will say one of my

1321
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:19,420
earliest memories of, of the super Nintendo. Um, I played it at a friend's house and I remember

1322
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:26,940
playing pilot wings and I was just blown away by the use of 3d. Cause remember guys, it was the

1323
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:33,180
early nineties. We didn't have like mode seven and what that gave us, which all mode seven is,

1324
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:39,980
is basically the 3d manipulation of a sprite. If you look at a pilot wing stage, it's a bunch of

1325
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:45,580
sprites strung together, but the way they rotate it and make it look, they make it look like a

1326
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:50,140
fucking like actual, like that was the most like real life thing you'd seen at that point. That

1327
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:55,020
was incredible experiencing that for the first time. And, uh, in case you forgot many people

1328
02:06:55,020 --> 02:07:02,780
remember, um, the, uh, airplane stuff and pilot wings in the skydiving, but don't forget pilot

1329
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:08,620
wings in the later stages had that fun as hell rocket pack thing. You remember that there was

1330
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:13,820
something they had the rocket pack. That was so awesome to play. Uh, and it wasn't really any of

1331
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:18,220
the previous. So I think, I think that was it. I think it was the plane, the skydiving, the rocket

1332
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:23,180
pack. And I think there was one other thing that showed up in some of the levels, but yeah. Uh,

1333
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:28,380
and then quest Buster says I was playing F zero F zero was also an incredible use of mode seven.

1334
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:32,620
If you think about it, those stages, all they are, are just a bunch of sprites together,

1335
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:41,180
like lie down in a 3d form and it was incredible. So, um, yeah. Uh, those were really impressive

1336
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:45,580
launch games and y'all know I stand F zero and I really wish they would release another F zero

1337
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:52,220
game. Although I feel like Mario karts all we're going to get. Um, but, uh, those were some strong

1338
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:58,300
launch games that did the Nintendo thing very well at showing off what the system could do.

1339
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:03,740
And then Mario world of course, was just a rock fucking solid Mario game that showed off a lot

1340
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:08,700
of cool stuff. It didn't show it off to the extent that pilot wings and F zero did. But, you know,

1341
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:13,180
I think many people still remember that very first stage where the bullet that's like eight

1342
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:19,580
times the size of Mario starts flying at you. And of course, Yoshi, right? Is that so, um,

1343
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:25,900
and honestly that Mario game was so fucking good. Many people consider that the best Mario game.

1344
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:32,620
Um, usually it's a tight race between Mario three, Mario world and Mario 64. And I think

1345
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:37,660
a lot of it depends on your age and what Mario game you have memories with, but I digress. Um,

1346
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:42,620
yes. Tiger class says another thing about pilot wings. When you make it far enough,

1347
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:46,620
there was a level where you fly a helicopter, I think, and you were bombing some targets.

1348
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:52,540
Yes. That was like a surprise twist, like way late in the game. Like you have to get all the

1349
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:57,660
way to like stage seven or eight. You're right. You're right. Oh, Bobby Blackwell says no love

1350
02:08:57,660 --> 02:09:03,180
for Gradius three or SIM city where though that's right. SIM city was a launch title.

1351
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:07,820
No, I have a lot of love for SIM city. Gradius three was good too. I didn't really honestly play

1352
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:13,580
that one a lot when it launched, but that's right. SIM city was Nintendo's take on a rock

1353
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:19,100
solid PC title. And that was where they had Dr. Right. Right. Based off will right. And you could

1354
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:24,700
get the Bowser stat. No, it was Bowser instead of Godzilla. It was a Mario statue. It was a very,

1355
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:30,300
it's it's honestly, I think it's the best port of SIM city, uh, next to the CD rom with SIM

1356
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:34,700
city action news, which we've parodied on this show before. Uh, it's probably the second best

1357
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:40,380
SIM city game. That's true. Uh, quest buster and chat says great music and Gradius three,

1358
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:45,980
uh, sacred Jade says I still have SIM city for the SNES. I I'll stand it. Uh, and that's,

1359
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:51,420
you know what it is. That version of the game has things no other versions of SIM city have.

1360
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:56,140
So based on that Nintendo touch, so that is something to consider.

1361
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:01,740
Um, yeah, ultra man on the SNES points out tiger claws, right? So there's,

1362
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:07,180
it's just 30 years of memories on the super Nintendo. It was a good time. And honestly,

1363
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:11,820
I don't know about you guys. I really think super Nintendo was just the best system they

1364
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:16,060
ever put out. I th I still think the super Nintendo holds up stronger than even like the

1365
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:22,300
PlayStation four or the X-Box. I just think the super Nintendo was it. And maybe that's my age

1366
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:29,420
talking. I don't know. And maybe the turbo graphics in Japan, not in the U S so I don't

1367
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:34,860
know. Or maybe it's just because my love for super, super Metroid is that deep, but y'all

1368
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:40,620
that are going to respond with chrono trigger. Guess what? That was super Nintendo too.

1369
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:46,540
So how many consoles can say they have both chrono trigger and super Metroid? I mean,

1370
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:52,300
the galaxy is at peace when you consider both of those things were on the super Nintendo.

1371
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:58,540
Um, let's see. Ooh. All right. Uh, let's see. Yeah. I still have that little bit of a cough.

1372
02:10:58,540 --> 02:11:04,380
Sorry. That's okay. Um, Bobby Blackwell, the chat says the chess master was the first SNES game

1373
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:11,020
release, not on launch day. Really? I didn't realize that. Um, let's see. Uh, and Bobby

1374
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,020
Blackwell says super Nintendo is my favorite console and I won't read his other comment.

1375
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:20,940
He can go post that on Facebook gaming, uh, w four. He just sees dog in super Metroid.

1376
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:27,180
Uh, w four says blockbuster with a bucket of popcorn specials. Oh yeah. Talking about renting

1377
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:32,060
super Nintendo games. Hell yeah. When you go rent the super Nintendo games of blockbuster or

1378
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:35,820
Hollywood video or whatever, and then yeah, you can get your bucket of popcorn and you know,

1379
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:42,700
$4 candy. Absolutely. Ooh, quest buster with another great early title. Act raiser is another

1380
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:47,260
great game that I'm a huge fan of. I stayed up all night playing that one. And you know what?

1381
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:53,100
I can't think of a lot of things like Actraiser in gaming, maybe I guess, but see, I can think

1382
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:58,220
of things that are like the SIM part of Actraiser, but the way that Actraiser really blended those

1383
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:03,500
things together, I can't think of anything like that. Um, I know I've talked about it on the show

1384
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:08,140
before, but, um, the game that I got, so I didn't get my super Nintendo on launch day. I think I

1385
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:13,420
ended up getting it that holiday or maybe the next year, but my parents had no idea what game to get

1386
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:18,140
me. So it came with super Mario world. And they said that the person at the counter at Montgomery

1387
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:21,980
ward, where they got the super Nintendo, I think that was it or some of that recommended

1388
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:29,980
that they get Draken, which was a PC game that they had ported to super Nintendo.

1389
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:37,020
Um, it was okay. It did the, it did the 3d thing in an RPG environment, but I will say this,

1390
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:44,300
the sequel dragons view is great. That was one of those blockbuster games. I read it because I was

1391
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:49,660
like, eh, the first game was okay. I didn't love it. I did beat it eventually, but dragons view

1392
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:54,620
two is fucking great because it does more like side scroll or action stuff. It kind of does the

1393
02:12:54,620 --> 02:13:00,700
act, act, razor thing a little bit actually. So there is that. All right. Uh, let's get to the

1394
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:04,540
listener round table. So if you guys want to give us a call, you can head on over to the green room

1395
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:09,980
over at vog network.com slash discord. Um, or we can do some emails, although I'm not sure we have

1396
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:16,780
any tonight, but I'll ask over at, um, uh, participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Do we

1397
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:23,260
have any emails tonight? Dark soccer. No, no. Just some spam. All right. Well, I don't want

1398
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:28,140
spam. Send, send the spam back. Um, if you would like to send us an email in a future week,

1399
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:33,500
participate at orange laundry.com is the place to do it. Uh, I didn't see anyone in the green room

1400
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:38,860
either. Let me check in. Well, actually I will also open it up, uh, for folks in chat. Uh,

1401
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:42,140
folks in chat are still talking about super Nintendo memories. Let me ask you guys,

1402
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:45,580
I mentioned that like Mario world and Dracken were kind of like my first

1403
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:48,620
super Nintendo games. What about you guys? What were like some of the first early super

1404
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:53,500
Nintendo memories? Although dark soccer, you were, were you a Genesis household? I can't remember

1405
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:58,460
how this went. I was a super Nintendo house. Okay. Dan had the Genesis. What were, Oh,

1406
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:04,620
you were, you are the lucky kid on the block. Uh, I mean, after he and I got together long past

1407
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:09,180
when I was a child. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, what were your, what were your early super Nintendo

1408
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:18,940
memories? Um, playing home alone with my brothers, uh, kicking them out of actually

1409
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:23,580
putting the super Nintendo in my bedroom and kicking them out so I can play legend of Zelda.

1410
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:31,900
Um, lots of turn taking in super Mario world and trying to figure out blastress with the super

1411
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:39,260
scope. We had a super scope. That's awesome. Yeah. Loki, what about you?

1412
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:46,060
Um, I mean, I don't know. I had, there was privilege with my ex.

1413
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:52,220
I had roadrunners death Valley rally. Cause that was the game I picked for some reason.

1414
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:57,740
I think probably cause that was the only game that the store had with, cause I had sold my,

1415
02:14:57,740 --> 02:15:05,180
uh, Coleco vision and Nintendo to get a super Nintendo. And so I got, I think roadrunners

1416
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:09,500
death Valley rally. And then I don't remember any other games I got, but I had a lot of friends.

1417
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:16,700
I borrowed games from, so that's fine. Um, but yeah, probably that game. And then like,

1418
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:24,460
you know, uh, link to the past and final fantasy six, you know, three, I guess. Um,

1419
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:30,220
but yeah, those are probably the games I remember. Oh God, when final fantasy two came out, you know,

1420
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:36,620
here in the U S uh, number four was number two in the U S um, uh, when that game came out, I,

1421
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:41,660
I remember asking for that for Christmas and I got it and I know it was not a cheap game. Um,

1422
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:47,180
and, uh, I played that so many hours I lost in that game. That game was incredible.

1423
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:51,500
And then of course, when three came out, I lost a lot of hours in that one too. That's for sure.

1424
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:55,260
But then I think like, God, the super Nintendo was the system that brought us street fighter.

1425
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:59,020
Remember they released street fighter on the super Nintendo. And it really was

1426
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:04,220
like for us at the time, it really was arcade perfect. Even though of course you go back

1427
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:07,900
through another lens now and you kind of look at it and you go, eh, it did have its issues. Like

1428
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:13,100
it wasn't quite as, as crisp as the arcade, but it was, it was, it was damn good. Yeah,

1429
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:19,340
it was damn good. Um, we got it. What passed as arcade perfect back in the day, you know,

1430
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:24,140
with like, you know, some of the stuff that was on earlier systems, I think that it was

1431
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:28,220
acceptable, um, for that. And especially that in like moral combat or something.

1432
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:31,980
I was just about to bring up mortal combat, which came out on good old mortal Monday,

1433
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:35,340
because video games didn't seem to have a regular release day back in the day.

1434
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:39,980
Mortal combat was also on the super Nintendo. Now I, I think a lot of people notice it did

1435
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:46,060
move a little slug sluggish more, but the graphics were very good. Like it looked a

1436
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:51,420
lot like the arcade version, except, Oh yeah, that whole issue with the sweat versus the blood.

1437
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:56,140
And that was a huge deal back in the day was that, wow, this is arcade perfect. Except for one thing,

1438
02:16:58,140 --> 02:17:02,780
the thing that most of us associate mortal combat with, but that was, you know, that was the big

1439
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:07,260
thing going on. Yeah, that's true. Then tiger claw points out when the original Mortal combat

1440
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:10,700
came out on the super Nintendo, the first one wasn't perfect, but when they released mortal

1441
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:15,100
combat two on the super Nintendo, this was the first time they had blood showing on the super

1442
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:20,220
Nintendo. That's right. I keep forgetting mortal combat two came out on the super Nintendo, but

1443
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:25,980
yeah, that was a really good, uh, translation of that game too. And yeah, I had the vote because

1444
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:33,260
at that point, now you had the ratings were established. The ESRB was established.

1445
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:37,900
So Nintendo was willing to put out those games now because they had those warning labels on them

1446
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:43,740
and kind of that general system that was in the U S so yeah, mortal combat two had all that blood.

1447
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:49,180
So, um, that was a pretty big deal. Mortal combat three then moved on to PlayStation. Um, I don't

1448
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:52,220
think that ever came out on super Nintendo. Cause I think they kind of upped the, uh,

1449
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:57,180
although I don't think the graphics were that much better than two, but I guess, I guess maybe the

1450
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:01,260
stages when you like, cause moral combat three was when you could like knock somebody down under the

1451
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:05,500
ground or up through the ceiling or whatever, things like that. So it kind of, um, did stuff

1452
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:10,700
there. Oh, did it. Okay. Sorry. Sacred Jade said mortal combat three did come out for super Nintendo.

1453
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:15,260
I guess I only remember it on PlayStation. So, all right. I see. I forgot about that one.

1454
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:21,580
Interesting. But then mortal combat four went 3d. I know that one was a super Nintendo,

1455
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:27,580
uh, Bobby Blackwolf and chap pointed out that a Frogger was the last release on the super Nintendo

1456
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:32,620
and my brain went, Oh, they must've because that PlayStation Frogger was very popular

1457
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:35,900
when it came out, they must've done a port for that for super Nintendo. Actually. No,

1458
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:42,620
it turns out I, it was just a different type of Frogger game actually. So interesting.

1459
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:50,380
All right. Um, let's go to any last minute stories that Loki might have tonight.

1460
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:56,460
I don't have any. Oh, all right. We covered everything. Huh? All right. Let me see. Uh,

1461
02:18:56,460 --> 02:19:00,860
I'm going to go to our discord over at vog network.com slash discord. And I just want to

1462
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:05,020
check in real quick because you guys post a lot of good stories throughout the week in the orange

1463
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:09,820
lounge radio channel. So, Oh God, I saw this earlier today and this cracked me up. And maybe

1464
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:16,940
you'd like this to Loki, uh, dungeon Buster posted in our discord, the no Skyrim mod.

1465
02:19:17,580 --> 02:19:22,300
And it does just what the name suggests. It stops you from playing Skyrim. When you

1466
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:31,260
boot it up to start a new game, it simply won't let you know what a stupid idea, but I love it.

1467
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:38,060
Okay. That's the mod for dark Sakura. No Skyrim. It's a, it's a mod called no Skyrim.

1468
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:42,300
And that's exactly what the mod does is exactly that. When you try to start a new game of Skyrim,

1469
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:48,620
it won't let you. Okay. How about I've never actually played through a whole game of Skyrim.

1470
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:54,940
You should, you should try this one. Nobody has true. It's a very long game. Um,

1471
02:19:54,940 --> 02:20:01,020
time do I have for that? I've got, um, yeah. All right.

1472
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:07,100
Um, let's see some other, uh, of stories that have been posted. Oh, I thought this was interesting.

1473
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:13,900
Um, 13 X forever, um, posted a tweet, uh, that, uh, good old games updated five old

1474
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:19,660
ask Konami titles on PC. But this also is a reminder. Some of these games reported to PC

1475
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:24,540
and you may have forgot, including the Castlevania and Contra collection. I used to play that on

1476
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:29,100
game tap just to not age myself too much, but maybe a little bit, uh, metal gear solid and

1477
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:34,700
metal gear solid two silent hill for the room. I forgot that got a PC port, but it did.

1478
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:42,300
And the original metal gear. I forgot that is based off the MSX version, not the Nintendo.

1479
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:46,220
They actually translated the MSX version. So I didn't even realize that was something I could

1480
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:51,740
buy. So I might get that. So yeah, they patched all those titles this week. Why? Because they

1481
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:57,020
wanted to support modern controllers. So all of these games now support like PlayStation

1482
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:02,220
controllers and Xbox one game pads and stuff. And the key bindings are a little different and

1483
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:07,660
things like that. I thought that was really, uh, neat, uh, that those games, it was a good

1484
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:12,540
reminder, like, Hey, if you want to play like the actual original metal gear, even though we

1485
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:18,220
associate the NES version, a lot of times with that, uh, you can check that out on, um, uh,

1486
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:21,180
that version of the game, which will now work with your current controller.

1487
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:28,780
Um, awesome. Awesome. I think that I'll leave it at that for now. A lot of these other things you

1488
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:32,060
guys posted, we did cover on the show at some point, but I thank you guys for bringing those

1489
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:37,180
to our attention in discord anyway. And I think with that, we are towards the end of the show.

1490
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:40,460
Um, so I'll go around and get final thoughts in just a moment, but first,

1491
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:44,300
as always, I want to thank you guys for downloading orange lounge radio and participating

1492
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:48,140
with the show, whether you did that live, you were downloading the video live as we were doing it,

1493
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:52,460
or if you, uh, listen to us on the podcast feed later in the week, I really want to thank you for,

1494
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:56,460
um, making orange launch radio part of your week. Um, I said at the top of the show,

1495
02:21:56,460 --> 02:22:00,300
I'll just remind everybody again, we will not be here next week over the labor day weekend. Um,

1496
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:04,620
since I will be out of town and I think a lot of people have their own plans going on anyway. Um,

1497
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:09,420
dark soccer will be streaming though. If you want to, if you want to still hang with, um,

1498
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:16,380
somebody it's, it's the night for Debbie delight. All right. And, uh, I, I hope to, uh, come back

1499
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:20,140
in a couple of weeks and talk a lot about some of the awesome things I heard at dragon con and

1500
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:24,620
some of the panels hope to meet a lot of great people there. Um, if you enjoyed what you heard

1501
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:28,300
here at orange launch radio, please help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show,

1502
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:32,220
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put

1503
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:38,300
out on air, what can we do? Um, so please help us spread the word. I'm an auto host for VOG network

1504
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:43,900
here at Twitch goes a very long way. So thank you for everybody that does that. Um, you don't have

1505
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:48,700
to, but if you want to, you can check out our shop, vog at network.com slash shop, and you can

1506
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:52,860
pick up some, uh, good looking clothes for yourself to wear to conventions or wherever you like the

1507
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:57,180
grocery shopping, wherever you want to take it, uh, such as, and I'm, I'm surprised nobody pointed

1508
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:02,700
this out yet, but I will point out, I am wearing the Vaught. Well, dark soccer and Loki haven't

1509
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:06,140
pointed it out because they can't actually see me unless they're watching the Twitch feedback.

1510
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:13,580
Um, we have, okay. So I am wearing that new VOG network logo logo design. That's a little

1511
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:17,980
bit like jet set radio or eighties ask, uh, the dark soccer put together a couple of months ago.

1512
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:21,980
So I am wearing that new and you can check that out over at vog network.com slash shop. If you

1513
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:26,700
want to, uh, after the show, I have to put this right back in the wash. So I have it ready for

1514
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:32,540
Wednesday when I leave, uh, cause I want to wear this. I actually have like four VOG shirts for

1515
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:37,740
the five days of dragon con, I guess Monday, I'm going to just wear normal clothes, I guess. So,

1516
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:42,620
uh, yeah, there it is over at vog network.com slash shop. If you want to, uh, check out this

1517
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:45,500
shirt that I'm wearing on the Twitch feed or for the podcast folks, you want to see what I'm

1518
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:50,060
talking about. It's over there on the shop. Let's check that out. Yeah. There's all different styles

1519
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:55,900
of the shirt. I like the baseball Jersey, even though the long sleeves aren't always awesome

1520
02:23:55,900 --> 02:24:00,300
for California. I will say it will be late in a couple of months when we're finally past the

1521
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:06,540
summer. And I went to San Francisco today and this shirt was perfect because it's still easy breezy

1522
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:12,300
in San Francisco. So there's that for sure. All right. Um, now we can get final thoughts

1523
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:16,540
and dark soccer. I know you're going to head off to start, uh, the murder party. So, uh, what,

1524
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:21,420
uh, is your final thought for us tonight? Um, don't be a dick.

1525
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:28,300
Good call. I appreciate that. All right. Have a good one. Bye. Uh, let's see. My final thought

1526
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:36,540
for tonight is, um, I just, I'm really looking forward to getting out of the house for the first

1527
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:43,180
time since March and going on a trip. So, um, you know, obviously, uh, you know,

1528
02:24:43,180 --> 02:24:48,220
with the Delta variant and everything, I can't say I'm not a hundred percent nerve free,

1529
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:52,780
but I appreciate that there are lots of people, including the convention taking precautions.

1530
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:59,180
Um, and, um, I think that everything's going to be just fine. Um, but if you haven't been vaccinated

1531
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:06,060
yet, uh, please do that. Uh, as you probably heard the Pfizer vaccine got the full FDA approval.

1532
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:10,940
So if you were holding out on that, um, there, it went that there's your excuse. Uh, I still,

1533
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:15,820
I still, it blows my mind how people are like, I don't want to take an experimental vaccine,

1534
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:20,300
but I'll inject myself with animal drugs that haven't been proven to be used. I do not

1535
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:24,940
understand that logic whatsoever on the animals. I understand I'm going to have political

1536
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:29,580
differences with people. Um, but I would think those political differences would come down to

1537
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:34,380
like, should the governor be recalled? And in my opinion, no, he shouldn't. And don't forget to

1538
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:38,780
vote, but that's my opinion. And people are going to disagree with me there. At least I can

1539
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:44,220
understand that disagreement a little more than I understand how the governor ticked people off

1540
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:50,140
that one. I get a little more than I'm not going to take a vaccine. I'm going to inject myself

1541
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:55,340
with a cow drug that I just, I don't get. So I don't, I don't know. I don't know when that

1542
02:25:55,340 --> 02:26:02,860
shit became political or why. Well, I, I do, but it should never have gotten that way. All right.

1543
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:06,140
Anyway. Um, Loki, let's go to you last but not least in your final thought.

1544
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:12,460
I played laser tag today. I'm surprised that the place isn't closed down yet. And they,

1545
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:19,100
they actually, within the two years time that they had to fix all this stuff, they, um, did hardly

1546
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:25,020
anything. So what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Uh, and Bobby does point out,

1547
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:28,940
you did leave the house, Ida. Yeah. We missed a show. Cause I went out to Idaho one point. Yeah.

1548
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:34,140
For me, that felt a lot different though. Cause I was going to like my friend's house. It's just my

1549
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:38,780
friend's house was 10 hours away. I wasn't hanging out in like a big, big crowd of people, but I get

1550
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:44,060
it fair point for a point. Uh, that's why. And somebody did get COVID after that trip.

1551
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:49,820
So it might not be, it wasn't me, but it might not be the best comparison. Uh, entire call in

1552
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:55,740
the chat says, uh, and don't forget to take a shower before going to the con. I take a shower

1553
02:26:56,300 --> 02:27:02,780
every morning, even during a convention. Thank you very much. I feel gross and sweaty if I don't

1554
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:07,660
take a fricking shower in the morning. So I just, I can't, I can't live my con life like that.

1555
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:15,100
Also. Uh, you all know by now that, uh, we, we, we splurge on a suite at dragon con. We,

1556
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:18,700
we spend the extra money. It's don't worry. It's not the money we spend our own money,

1557
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:25,180
Bobby black Wolf and myself on getting a suite at dragon con. And the reason why we do it is

1558
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:30,780
so that it's like, we're not cramped in a room with four or five people. I've done that. I

1559
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:36,460
know many of you still do that, but it's nice to just have space and just be like, I'm going to

1560
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:40,780
just, you know, there's, there's not six people I'm trying to fight for the shower with. I can

1561
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:46,220
do that. You know, it's, it's, it's very easy. Uh, and so we like doing the cons that way,

1562
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:51,340
but if you didn't know, we were actually grandfathered into that suite by, uh, the

1563
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:57,660
incredible Travis Donovan, formerly of understation live, um, who was a legacy

1564
02:27:57,660 --> 02:28:03,820
room holder at the Hyatt. And basically he kind of ended up transferring that cause he stopped

1565
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:07,020
going to dragon con for a couple of years. He kind of transferred that to me. And that's where

1566
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:11,580
the VOG network suite, uh, comes from. Yes. And Bobby Blackwell says your subs and bits do not

1567
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:16,060
pay for the suite. Yes. I want to make that very clear. That is not what it is. Uh, legal fees and

1568
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:21,580
the legal thing to run this network. Yes. Um, appearances and promotion at other conventions.

1569
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:26,860
Yes, but not that we, I don't want people to get that idea. So, um, cause that's, that would be

1570
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:34,060
very, very bad optics. And we know that, um, yeah. As 200 Matt says, yeah, I'm too old for the

1571
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:38,860
cramming 10 people into a two queen room for con thing. Just want to bed in my own space. Look,

1572
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:43,580
I don't begrudge anyone who does do that. Cause I know plenty of people that still do that.

1573
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:48,220
That's fine. That's a great life for you. It's just not a great life for me. Anyway,

1574
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:52,700
that's it. That's enough. Uh, we're going to see you guys in two weeks.

1575
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:56,220
