00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week, one beta ends as another one begins as Valve releases family sharing as the Steam Music Beta begins.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
News from South Park and Stick of Truth continues with outrage from policy makers and gamers alike over censorship in much of the world.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll take your comments on these events on the show wherever Gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 542 of our show for this March the 2nd of 2014.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts and over the next few hours we'll be talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How you doing?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm happy.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're happy? Good. That's good. If you're happy and you know what, clap your hands.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
May I have a little more please?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes. Just as long as you're going to be okay to drive.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is me.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We decided to crack open a bottle of wine here in the studio so you know, that's how things go.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's how we roll here at OLR. But drink responsibly kids.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a three hour show so we've got a lot of time.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I just made the heart fingers at Rob.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, and joining us via the Skype line, say hello everybody to Loki Oler. How you doing Loki?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm doing good.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good, good. What's new?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not much.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just put in a cat door today.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Put in a what?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A cat door.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A cat door. Oh, you're being quite homely while you're around. Being the man of the house.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, I guess. So, yeah. Because the cat was annoying me and kept whining at the door.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And sure enough, I put the door in, she didn't give a shit. She's like not even bothering with the door anymore.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So you should have made the cat door so the cat can go out but the cat can't get back in.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Actually, funny you should say that, there's actually an option on there to do that.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Or you can have her come in only. You can lock it one way so it's kind of funny.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Awesome. Well, there you go. Well, I do want to say hi to everybody.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I try to do this once in a while every few months or so but sort of reintroduce ourselves.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So if it is your first time listening to this show, welcome.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And just a quick reintroduction, my name is Rob, that's Jamie.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And joining us on the Skype line tonight is Loki, or Matt.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And he's on the Skype line because him and Mrs. Loki just had a baby about, where are we at now?

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Over a month ago now at this point, right? Or just about a month ago?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's like six weeks.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wow, time flies. But he's still on baby leave.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Usually we're all in the same studio but obviously we want Loki to take time while the wife is healing and all that stuff.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So usually though we're all in the same room and about ten years ago we all met at a local arcade playing a music-based video game.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, those types of things.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We would meet up once a week or so at the arcade just like you would with a fighting game community or racing game community.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And afterwards we go to the diner across the street, sit around the table, and just talk about gaming because we're all gaming nerds.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So here we are 12 years later, we're doing that same thing virtually.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And thanks to the internet we have the world's biggest diner table via our Skype line, our Twitter, and the chat room.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Because after all we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We are live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
vognetwork.com.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
By the way Rob, since someone complained.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sup bitches.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Someone complained that you weren't using your usual tagline.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not really my usual, I've done it twice.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well you said a couple weeks ago it was going to be your new tagline.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay now it's my, okay, sup bitches.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop disappointing the people out there.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Rob, you know what?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Stop being a false icon.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I reject that statement.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you guys so much.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Whether you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or whatever, or listening to us live.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We're up against, you know, the Oscars as being a live Sunday night show.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We typically seem to go up against like every big American thing.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You know, every award show, every Super Bowl, sports-a-thon thing seems to be on a Sunday night.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But you guys are loyal listeners, you're here with us.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So hoping we can include you guys as much as possible as we go through tonight's show.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's talk about our kickoff topic real quick.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Since the Oscars are going on after all, I mean I'm going to acknowledge that it's a big movie night.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Although I'm going to be honest, I didn't see a single one of the movies nominated.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I saw maybe like three movies last year.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What was nominated?

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've just become that.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know, everybody's talking about Gravity and 12 Years a Slave is the other one.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And American Hustle, which I should have seen because I do love Jennifer Lawrence.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She's perfect.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I am pissed off though that Saving Mr. Banks didn't show up.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because it was really good.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't even know what that is.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Is that the Disney one?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That was the Disney one.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, I didn't see that.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Tom Hanks should have freaking won everything for being Walt Disney, sorry.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I used to watch the Oscars every year, then I got this show.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh well, it's fine. I prefer doing this.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So the Oscars are the Oscars.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But it does beg the question, since we are a video game show, this is usually the time of year where we talk about video game movies.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And the question I want to ask everybody is, you know, and this goes to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's it going to take, or is it ever going to happen, where a movie based on a video game can actually be a contender for an Oscar?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because let's be real, most of the video game movies they've put out have been stinkers.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's only been a few good ones, passable ones.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The original Mortal Kombat I think most people agree, it wasn't bad.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Resident Evil, depending on what you're into, seems like most people.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And they're not quite game canon anyway.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, they're really not.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
First Silent Hill, I really like that.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't even mind the second one.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It wasn't really for everybody.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But let's be real, that game was never going to get, it's not really an Oscar flick, it's a popcorn flick.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But we do see that the caliber of writing in some games these days is really, really good.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course, I would be a bad fan boy if I didn't throw out the fact that Mass Effect has some really great writing.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If we kind of overlook that ending thing with number three, I mean they did go back and fix it and then the Citadel DLC.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Clituring some of the characterizations.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, so we'll overlook the imperfections and say, you know, overall Mass Effect had some great writing.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And who goes to bed in their armor, really?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A lot of people loving Dragon Age as well.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Not to put all the focus on BioWare, because certainly tons of people are really enjoying The Last of Us.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Even Beyond Two Souls, you know, is kind of like a playable type of game.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or is it a playable type of movie that is a game.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So my question is, do we think we'll ever see the type of movie that actually gets nominated for Oscars?

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not talking about just necessarily like special effects Oscars, that's one thing.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm talking about like writing, heaven forbid acting, or even a picture nomination.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Could we ever get that type of caliber movie out of a video game?

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or are movies based on video games forever pigeonholed into, well they're gonna suck.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think it would really just take having the right director behind it, and having the right people in it.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I think that would turn a lot of it around.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because I mean, if you actually, going back to the Silent Hill one.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Despite, you know, it being really following more of the game formula with the movie.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The acting in it was really freaking top notch.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It really was good. I mean look who was in it.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Had some of the best, you know, actors, especially, what's her face, that played the big bad lady.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Not that played Dahlia, but played Alice Krieg the bored queen.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh my god I love her. She is perfectly creepy.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I wanted all of those performances to be nominated because they were really good.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well I think they got nominated in like science fiction awards and things that are a little more niche.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So we can't say that the movie was completely ignored.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But obviously there were a lot of people that didn't like the movie.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well I understand. Some of it was a little cheesy.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The little girl was a little bit cheesy.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Silent Hill! Silent Hill!

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay that part was...

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It had its imperfections.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But the rest of it was awesome.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Loki, what do you think?

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The only chance I think that they have is like, you know, maybe if that Minecraft movie comes out later on.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because it's being done by like, was it the guys that did the Lego movie?

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think that could win like the best animated movie or something.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But I don't know.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A lot of the people that bring on video game properties, they don't really take it seriously.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I just, I don't know if you would really see like Oscar winning performances out of that stuff.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the responses.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
First we have some other people naming movies that really weren't bad that were based on video games.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
AkumaJP says, the first Tomb Raider movie, which actually might have gotten...

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Somebody would have to look that up, but I think it might have gotten Oscar nods,

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but in like the special effects type of categories.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like, you know, Angelina Jolie wasn't nominated.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Neither was her leg.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dungeonbuster says, Prince of Persia wasn't too bad either.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I forgot about that one. I think that's the problem.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Raginator brings up Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And some other comments on this topic.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A good video game movie doesn't take the source material as gospel.

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They need to tweak it to work as an actual movie.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And we do see, I mean it's not like there isn't movies based on other material.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They have a whole category at the Oscars for that.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because they have the best screenplay original and best screenplay based on some type of source.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And almost always it's a book.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Either a memoir or a fiction book or what have you.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Once in a while it might even be like a newspaper article.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You know, there might be some other type of inspiration.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But it's not like there isn't a category where a, putting my fanboy hat on, Mass Effect movie couldn't fit into.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But the question is, are we ever going to see something of that caliber? I don't know.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Brad from Pod Culture suggests Bioshock would be a great candidate, I think, for that type of movie.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Even though I'm not into fandom, I think that of all of them, Assassin's Creed II would actually make a good story.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because it would be historical fiction having to deal with some of the most fucked up politics ever in Renaissance Europe.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Speaking of fandoms, I've always been surprised you're not really into Bioshock.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like I know you downloaded games, checked them out, but I'm kind of surprised.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I haven't had time to, I started Infinite, remember, right before I started.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I know you're a big fan of like art direction in games.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And like when I think of games with like A plus art direction, Bioshock Infinite's like up there.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have the game. I've started playing it.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's just, you know, with me working at, you know, Locat.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I understand.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I haven't been able to...

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I understand.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Degenerate Johnny in chat is placing his bets.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Degenerate Johnny says, the first video game movie that will win an Oscar will be the Warcraft movie because Blizzard never settles less than the best.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I could definitely see Warcraft, I mean, depending on where they're going with it.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I could see Warcraft be one of those special effects, those types of contenders.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Will the writing be good?

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's a lot riding on that movie, isn't there?

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We'll see. We will sure see.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I would actually see a movie based off of Assassin's Creed 2.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just because seeing those Medicis killing each other and busy being Pope, that would be awesome.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ragenator brings up, if you keep Ue Bull the fuck away from the movies.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know, I kind of feel like he's a joke that died out several years ago.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean, isn't, like, has he been allowed to make a movie?

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Loki, you've followed him more than any of us.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Not that you should be proud of that, but has he made any movies lately?

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think he has some new movie coming out soon, but he hasn't really made a whole ton of stuff lately.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think he's been trying to do his own properties, and he even made, like, was it Tunnel Rats that he wanted to spin off into a game?

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think that happened, but no one cared.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He should make Showgirls 2, honestly.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No. You do not want him touching our beloved Showgirls.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think he's doing another, remember, the last thing he did was try to kickstart another Postal movie.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He went to Kickstarter?

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, he went to Kickstarter.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
People gave that man money?

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, I don't think it, it failed, so he didn't.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What a shock. What a shock.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Didn't he do, now, there was a Dungeon Siege movie with Burt Reynolds in it, am I correct?

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There was several Dungeon Siege movies.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Wait, no, I'm sorry, I'm not thinking Dungeon Siege.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There was several, what was the vampire one that he used to do a lot of?

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Blood Rain. Several Blood Rain movies.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They were all terrible.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think we're all kind of over him, and certainly he's the guy that needs to stop giving video game movies a bad name because he's ruining it for all of us.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They had a Blood Rain movie that was a spaghetti western with zombies in it.

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What the hell?

216
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm sorry, last good zombie movie was that one that I still have of yours?

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
28 Days Later, although those weren't really zombies?

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, Wild Zero.

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, okay.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I need to give that back to you.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Anyway, so we'll see, so some of the chatters predicting Warcraft, my fandom predicts Mass Effect if they could ever make a movie out of that.

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Any predictions on what video game would make great source material for an Academy Award winning movie?

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I would have a really hard time watching a Mass Effect movie because you know they put some dude, I can't, my head cannon doesn't accept a male Shepard.

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I really think they could convince people better that FemShep works than male Shep.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I stan male Shep obviously because of some of the choices I made in the game, but I would accept FemShep in the movie.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Heck yeah.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Especially if they got somebody like, I don't know why but I just keep thinking, I think this is a really easy choice so I apologize to the FemShep fans out there, but for some reason I really picture Scarlett Johansson.

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just because she kicks so much ass as Black Widow.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, I can see that.

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
She'd have to, I think, work out a bit more.

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sure.

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I mean seriously, you know I actually installed a mod for my Mass Effect 3 that's called the Buff FemShep mod.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That actually makes her look less way fish and more like a career soldier.

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's actually really cool.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
As far as like a game, I could see, if you were going to do something animated, I would say Journey.

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oooh.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Have you ever seen any of those different animations where there's no dialogue, it's all set to music?

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oooh.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Or for example like the interstellar 5555.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So you're kind of almost going with a short film almost.

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You know what's funny is I was going to make a joke here because Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com suggests Gone Home as a movie and I was going to joke, oh that would be a short film wouldn't it?

242
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because the game wasn't really that long.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But, you know, actually that's the type of medium that really could work.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not like, it's unheard of.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Mortal Kombat now exists in short films on YouTube, the little episodic things they're doing.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But I think that Journey would make like a really neat art film.

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You know, I mean it's an art game if you want to be...

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And Blackwolf does remind us, Journey's soundtrack already ran a Grammy.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, it's already on its way to that.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Anyway, alright, we could sit here and fan wank about movies and video games and all this for a very long time.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But we want to get into the gaming news, but we can't get there until we talk about...

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Wank Rob, wank as far as the eye can see.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We can't get there to gaming news until we talk about our frame of references and that's why we always do at the top of the show.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
How was your gaming week and what were the video games that you were playing this week?

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Dark Sakura.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is actually the first time I've been influenced by a fanfic.

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I started playing Dragon Age 2 again so I could play a mage.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I love your shirt.

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Actually, my shirt, since, thank you for...

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
My shirt actually says Realm Maintenance.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's actually another podcast that's out there and the host of Realm Maintenance, Ro, was kind enough to give me this shirt at BlizzCon.

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So, shout out to Ro and his fantastic podcast, Realm Maintenance, which is great in the Warcraft podcast community.

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I really wish we had something like it in the general gaming community. Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, I did start Dragon Age 2 again, except I'm not too happy with how my Hawk looks.

265
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So I'm going to redo her because I have a crap ton of mods.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And unfortunately, some of the mods that I put in made Aveline's face turn black.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So I ended up installing this mod that makes Aveline look like the default Hawk, except blonde or something.

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So I was like, okay, whatever, I can deal with Aveline being pretty.

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But I started Dragon Age 2 again, playing some more Mass Effect 3, just because I want to...

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I put my retagon game on hold for the longest time, so now I'm just trying to finish it.

271
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And we just cured the genophage.

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Ooh, I had cries again because...

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Crying.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Still playing Animal Crossing because what the fuck else?

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because those animals need Aaron's Run stat.

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey, I have no more Ed, so it's glorious.

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That dresser ain't going to run its way over to whatever's house by itself.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm like, hey, can you give this to Eric?

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Eric walks right by.

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sure?

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
My townsfolk are stupid.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So yeah, I played something else. I'm trying to remember what it was.

283
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh yeah, I did actually play Govellius on iOS, and it sucks. So I deleted it.

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I also did play the candy... what was the original?

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Candy swipe?

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Candy swipe? It's not fun.

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I mean, no offense to the guy, because it's not that the game isn't fun, it's that the music sucks.

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Get better music for it, and I'll play it more often.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That poor guy probably did it all himself on a Casio keyboard.

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It sounds like something, just, no, I could do better.

291
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Even if you hire me, I will do better.

292
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But I still bought the game, I still supported it, and I'm still telling people not to buy Candy Suck.

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I mean, Candy Crush or whatever the fuck they stupid shits call it.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I've had some wine, so I feel great.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I played something else, but...

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If Dark Soccer and I are a bit all over the place tonight, you'll know who to thank.

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It took me drinking half a bottle last night to be slightly tipsy.

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You can ask Becky, because she was there.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh yeah, I played Final Fantasy XIV.

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And thank you to everybody who helped me finish Braeflop.

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean, Braeflox is whatever the crap is called.

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But I still think it's funny to call it Braeflop, even though that's the best dungeon so far.

303
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because you're outside, and there's crap going on.

304
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you get to shoot fireflies. That's kind of cool.

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So yeah, I had a really good time playing Final Fantasy XIV, and I will get to play much more of it, and back to other games.

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Alright.

307
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So, stuff and things.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I almost felt like I was going to throw up watching Dan play Forza.

309
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That good, huh? Is that the new one on Xbox One or one of the other ones?

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No, it's not Forza. It was some other racing sim he has on his triple screen.

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What was that one? It's like an actual rally racing sim.

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Dirt?

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No, it's got some sort of interesting European sounding name, and whatever.

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
One of them.

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Some game, some game.

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Probably Toca?

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, it was two words, but I forget.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Anyway, Dan's doing his big sim racing thing again.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
They had it running all day, so I got really tired of hearing...

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know, so I was like, I'm going to hide in the back room.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Alright.

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's move on.

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It was okay.

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I didn't play a ton of stuff, because, you know, time and everything,

326
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but I did manage to play a few things.

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Sadly, not a lot of it I can really talk about, just because one of...

328
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, I can mention that I played Chroma, because I got into the alpha for that.

329
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I just can't mention what I thought about it.

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I mean, other than it was good, I guess.

331
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I played a little bit of South Park, the Stick of Truth.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
My God, is that game amazing.

333
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It is just fantastic.

334
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The humor in it is spot on, and it literally looks like you're watching the show.

335
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's just awesome.

336
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait, hold on, because a lot of people are kind of worried,

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
because there's, you know, tight embargoes on South Park,

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and I guess the reviews aren't going to pop up until right when the game comes out,

339
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
but knowing, you know, that you have your connections and things,

340
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
not piracy, we're talking about other connections that Loki has,

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you sometimes get things early, so you've actually had a chance to play it?

342
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, just a little bit, like 30 minutes.

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, because one of the big questions out there is that the rumor is the game is really short.

344
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like seven to eight hours.

345
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know about that.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay, well, I'm just throwing it out there, for better or worse.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The rumor is that the game is only like seven to eight hours,

348
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
which for an RPG is really short.

349
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But, I mean, if it can deliver the funny for seven to eight hours,

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I still, I like, I don't know, I kind of,

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
like the South Park movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life,

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
so if this game can deliver that for seven to eight hours,

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I do kind of think it's worth the $60, honestly, but we'll see, we'll see.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's pretty funny, there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you go to Cartman's house,

355
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and then you're standing there, and you're walking through the living room,

356
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and his mom's there, oh, you're a friend.

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And so, one of the options is to talk to her,

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and you try to talk to her, and Cartman's like,

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
she's not part of the game.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And so I just thought that was hilarious.

361
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Where they have like, you know, you can take a shit in your toilet

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and pick up the shit so you can throw it at people.

363
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You know, it's just, I don't know, it's just really South Park humor.

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Classy.

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then I think I'm pretty sure from what I read in the beta stuff

367
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
that it's okay to talk about,

368
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
the latest beta was for Elder Scrolls Online.

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I played a few minutes of that.

370
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I wasn't a big fan of the game,

371
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
well, I mean, when it first was down,

372
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so I was like, oh my god, this game looks awesome.

373
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And every little bit of news that I heard after that,

374
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
it's just been kind of going downhill.

375
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And I played it, and it didn't change my mind.

376
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, it looks like an Elder Scrolls game,

377
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but it's just kind of, I don't know,

378
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
missing something, like charm, I guess.

379
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But I mean, it's a beta still,

380
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
so obviously the opening cutscene stuff's gone,

381
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and they don't have that there.

382
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
They have a little text thing explaining what the cutscene was going to look like.

383
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And the combat's kind of okay.

384
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I was a little pissed off that it didn't support controllers,

385
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
because that's what I normally play stuff on,

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and so I had to do kind of keyboard, mouse,

387
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and it worked all right.

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But it's just, I don't know, I would definitely not pay for it.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But I don't know, people will be excited about it, I guess.

390
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Coming out in a couple months.

391
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We've been talking about that game pretty extensively over on Hoard House,

392
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
where we talk about a lot of the multiplayer and online games,

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and I have to admit, I wasn't even drinking on the show this weekend.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I kind of became a little unhinged at the whole Elder Scrolls thing,

395
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
because I'm just really shocked that they're going to charge a monthly fee for it,

396
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and every sign points to it's not going to work for them,

397
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and they're going to reverse on that mighty quick.

398
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I mean, we might be wrong, but we'll see, we'll see.

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The initial buzz doesn't look too great.

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, I don't know. It just seems very basic to me.

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But, like I said, I didn't give it that much time.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But I was short on time, I was like, okay, well, I can play more Elder Scrolls,

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
or I could play South Park.

404
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll play South Park.

405
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There you go.

406
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
All right.

407
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's pretty much it.

408
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's it.

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, my gaming week.

410
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I've got to admit, I didn't play a lot of new stuff,

411
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
because I'm still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV.

412
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But, again, I've been focusing on a game that I kind of went back to

413
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
after a little while away.

414
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I've been talking about the past couple weeks on the show Diablo III

415
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
on the PlayStation 3, which I was playing,

416
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and I was talking about how it kind of controls weird,

417
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
but, gosh, it makes me really curious to go back and check out the PC version.

418
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Well, like Clockwork, the PC version got a huge patch this last week,

419
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the 2.0 patch, because they've got that expansion coming

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that they want to get sold copies of

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and convince people they need to go to level 70

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and play as a Crusader and so forth.

423
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So there's a huge patch that went out for Diablo this weekend.

424
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It added clans into the game.

425
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But most importantly, it changed the loot system completely.

426
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And now the loot you get, the vast majority of it,

427
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
like 90% of it is something your class can actually use,

428
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
with the minority being stuff that you might want to put in your stash

429
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
to give to other characters.

430
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And the other huge change they made was the difficulty settings.

431
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They completely eliminated the fact that there are four difficulty levels.

432
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There was, what, Normal and Hell and Inferno.

433
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't remember what they were all called.

434
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But there was the four different difficulty levels.

435
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They eliminated that completely.

436
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And now all of the characters scale to your level,

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and you choose, do you want it to be Normal, where it's kind of easy?

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you want it to be Hard, where it's a little more difficult,

439
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
but you get increased experience and gold drops?

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Do you want it to be Terror, where it's even hard?

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And so on.

442
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So they changed it so that you have a little more tweak

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,

444
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
you've got this track, this track, this track, and this track.

445
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And I've got to tell you, when I first read that,

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I was a little bit like, oh, level scaling?

447
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't know.

448
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That doesn't work so well in Final Fantasy.

449
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But it really does work in Diablo III.

450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Because Normal, yeah, you can kind of steamroll it.

451
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And even Hard, if you have the right gear, is not really...

452
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've been playing mostly in Hard, and it's really not that hard.

453
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But as you get into other difficulties, I imagine things get a lot more difficult,

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
especially as you bring more players in the mix.

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So it really does feel like you have way more control

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,

457
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
you've got these four vanilla tracks.

458
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So I think in some regards, that has really changed the game.

459
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And most people I know that have gone back and played the game say,

460
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
wow, Diablo III is really fun.

461
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And it's not like they didn't go back and add really a lot of story,

462
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or they didn't really change the game in that regard.

463
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's just they made a few key design changes

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
that have really flipped the game upside down for some people in a good way.

465
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The Auction House is still there, but that will be eliminated in about two weeks, I think.

466
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And it's really a footnote now.

467
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You kind of have to really search for it to find it.

468
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because obviously they want to make it so you can just strip it out really easy

469
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and you're not even going to be able to notice.

470
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I couldn't even find the Real Money Auction House.

471
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I think that's already gone.

472
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Or that is so well hidden, I couldn't even find that.

473
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So, yeah, if you were not wanting to play Diablo III

474
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
because of some of the Auction House fuckery and all that,

475
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
it's different now.

476
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,

477
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Does it have BBF mode or Bobby Black Wolf Forever mode?

478
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So we sometimes call it.

479
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes and no.

480
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I mean, no, there's no super easy mode.

481
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But if you play on normal and you're just staying on top of your gear drops

482
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and replacing it, you will not have a problem.

483
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I really can't see that you're going to die an awful lot.

484
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And if you die, oh well.

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You run back to your corpse and you come back without penalty.

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's hardcore mode where you have to worry about that.

487
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Because in hardcore mode is the whole die once, die forever.

488
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I always kind of preferred the way Path of Exile handled that,

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
where if you die in hardcore mode,

490
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
your character is bumped down to the normal bracket

491
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and you can't play hardcore again on that character.

492
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I kind of like that a little better.

493
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It doesn't make the loss feel as severe,

494
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but the stakes are high when you decide to be a hardcore player.

495
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And it's so funny, because I actually did start a hardcore barbarian this week

496
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and I did not think I would like playing a barbarian,

497
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
but they're actually a lot of fun.

498
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But anyway, when you start a hardcore character,

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
you basically have to sign a waiver, so to speak, with your mouse.

500
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's like, this character will be gone forever if you die.

501
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Customer support will not bring these back for any reason.

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You have to accept this before you play.

503
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So it's pretty awesome.

504
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people got their free copy of Diablo 3

505
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
with the whole blood pact that Blizzard did with World of Warcraft some time ago.

506
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And even if you didn't, it's pretty cheap now, I think,

507
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
because they have that expansion.

508
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
They're going to try to make their money on the expansion.

509
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And they really...

510
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When you go to select a character,

511
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Crusader is just one of the options right there.

512
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You can pick just a witch doctor or barbarian

513
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
or something that's in the game normally.

514
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But of course, if you try to click OK, it'll say,

515
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
oh, Crusader is only available in Reaper of Souls.

516
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Give us your credit card now.

517
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You know, that whole type of thing.

518
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But yeah, Diablo 3, it's changed for the better.

519
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And if you had the game already,

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you didn't have to pay a monthly fee for it or anything.

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So reinstall it and check it out and see what you missed out on.

522
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or not so much what you missed out on,

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
but see what's new because it is worth checking out again.

524
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That oddly enough reminded me of what the other thing was, by the way.

525
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
League of Legends.

526
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, that's right. You started randomly getting into that, huh?

527
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I installed it just to see what it's like, but I haven't tried it yet.

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Well, that's nothing. You didn't play it then.

529
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Just saying.

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It doesn't count.

531
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's on my computer.

532
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Next. Well, big deal.

533
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I got a lot of stuff on my computer I've never touched either.

534
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You want to look at my Steam library?

535
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
All right.

536
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
After I get through going through mine.

537
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, as we get into the news a little later on tonight,

538
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
we can go through each other's.

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Ooh.

540
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
All right.

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Some housekeeping first before we get there.

542
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
As a reminder, there will be no show on March 16th.

543
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Or I should say no live show.

544
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I need to talk to Dark Soccer and Loki because I want to put something together

545
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that may be pre, you know, done in advance or whatever.

546
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So we'll try to do that.

547
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That way you podcast folks don't have to go a week with no show.

548
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But we will not be here live on March 16th.

549
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That is because the studio is moving.

550
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Because I am moving.

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Much more space.

552
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They're growing legs and they're walking.

553
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, there's going to be space.

554
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And with space means we can consider the webcam.

555
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's all I'm going to say.

556
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's all I'm going to say.

557
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm not going to promise nothing.

558
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So.

559
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'll be wearing a sheet.

560
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We can put you in a box.

561
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm going to become the Berka Avenger.

562
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We can put you in a box.

563
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll be cosplaying her every week.

564
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So no show, no live show on March 16th.

565
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And of course you can follow us on Twitter.

566
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

567
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We're also on Facebook.

568
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

569
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And one other important piece of housekeeping.

570
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
For the past couple weeks we've been talking about a fun little free game,

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
a parody game that's available over at VoG network dot com.

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It is Flappy VoG.

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And Flappy VoG.

574
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Flappy VoG did get its second character pack tonight.

575
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It is character pack two, the final.

576
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And the sole star of character pack two is Loki.

577
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So if you've.

578
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I got to say though, Loki's lines are pretty hilarious.

579
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I won't spoil it here.

580
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But well done sir.

581
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I laughed.

582
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I laughed a lot.

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I played it for a little bit and I'm already getting tired of hearing my voice.

584
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah.

585
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So you can check that out over at Flappy dot VoG network dot com.

586
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But as we talked about earlier on the Bobby Black Wolf show.

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Part of joke.

588
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Part of parody.

589
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Part of satire is that you got to know when to walk away.

590
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And the joke's already starting to get a little stale.

591
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Loki doing it has breathed some life into it.

592
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But after this it is for sure done.

593
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We're not going to really talk about it anymore.

594
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You got that song stuck in my head now.

595
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
What song?

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The Gambler.

597
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm a joker.

598
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm a smoker.

599
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You got to know when to hold it.

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Alright.

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Walk away.

602
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Are you going to serenade us with some karaoke revolution tonight?

603
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
No.

604
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Some Sing Star?

605
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No.

606
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You're already singing the Joker when I was talking about The Gambler.

607
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I have Sing Star Abba and Sing Star Queen.

608
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I need to borrow by the way Sing Star Abba.

609
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
In hell.

610
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Alright.

611
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bitch.

612
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Let's see if I bring you anyone.

613
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Let's get to.

614
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Although I think it was already here.

615
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Let's get to some gaming news.

616
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Loki will start us off while Dark Soccer and I fight over my copy of Sing Star Abba.

617
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Loki.

618
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, with the phasing out of a lot of the Wii stuff, they are now pulling the plug on

619
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
online play for the Wii and the DS.

620
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because hey!

621
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They have a Wii U and a 3DS that they want you to buy.

622
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So if you want to play online with people, you can buy a new system.

623
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And that is happening May 20th.

624
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And of course, that shuts down such things as just online play.

625
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Also, some of the stuff that will not be affected.

626
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course, anything that involves you paying them money.

627
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So the DSi shop or the Wii.

628
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What was it?

629
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The Wii shop.

630
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Those are staying open.

631
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Of course, the browsers and Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.

632
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That's all going to still work.

633
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But remember, they took away the weather and news channel.

634
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Well, now they are taking away online as well.

635
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That does kind of suck.

636
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I love to spin the globe and the weather channel and check out what the weather is going to

637
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
be like in Antarctica.

638
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I mean, I guess I could do that online.

639
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's cold.

640
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah, it is kind of disappointing that they have removed online for their games.

641
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Especially when you consider that a lot of other systems out there, their games are still

642
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
alive and kicking.

643
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Some of the thought might have been that this was due to the fact that they are releasing

644
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
their servers through GameFly or GameSpy.

645
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And because of that, and I think that they went under new ownership that the fees are

646
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
a lot higher.

647
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So now they're just kind of cutting their losses and hopefully trying to drive people

648
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
to play stuff on the Wii U.

649
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Also, considering I think one of the more popular games on there was Mario Kart Wii,

650
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and it literally shuts down 10 days before Mario Kart 8 comes out.

651
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So that could be something.

652
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Hmm.

653
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
A little bit aptly timed there.

654
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
By the way, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, VX JasonXV is in chat and talks about how he

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
likes to spin the globe and the Weather Channel and comes across Cockburn Town.

656
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
There's a place called Cockburn Town.

657
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I had no idea.

658
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
There's a Cockburn Town.

659
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Probably.

660
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I knew there was a Fuck Austria.

661
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I knew about that.

662
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it Fucking or Fuck?

663
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
One of the two.

664
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think it's Fucking or something, Austria.

665
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But I did not know there was a Cockburn Town, but apparently, yes, it is the capital of

666
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
the Turks and Caicos Islands.

667
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Who knew?

668
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Fun.

669
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Go visit Cockburn Town, everybody.

670
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
There's also stuff called Cockaleaky Soup, which I just think is funny.

671
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's basically Chicken and Leek Soup, but it's called Cockaleaky.

672
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No comment.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Hello all of our friends in Scotland.

674
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And it's not like you can't do this on theweatherchannel.com or maps.google or whatever, but I don't

675
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
know.

676
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There was something very therapeutic.

677
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Just roll with me here.

678
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Surely I can't be the only one.

679
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I know Jason just admitted to doing this too.

680
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
There was something very therapeutic to that little music in the Wii Weather Channel, the

681
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
doo doo doo.

682
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Little ambient Philip Glass shit that they would play in the background.

683
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I love Philip Glass.

684
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
He would just like spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe.

685
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And then like, Ooh, what's the weather going to be like here?

686
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Stop.

687
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
No way.

688
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He's fucking Austria.

689
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
All right.

690
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Anyway, but, but, but, but, but there's also hell and there's um, the crap else I was thinking

691
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of.

692
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Um, there's a cool California.

693
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

694
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
There's weed California.

695
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's right.

696
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They, they make a killing off shirts.

697
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes, they do merchandise.

698
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I went to weed and all I got was this shirt.

699
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
All right.

700
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So what do you mean to derail what you were saying?

701
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Was there anything?

702
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No, no, that, that's pretty much it.

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,480
I mean, it's just kind of sucks that they're, you know, shutting down the online, but they've

704
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,720
already kind of written that console off and to be honest, there's not really any games

705
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,160
coming out for it anymore.

706
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,400
There's some of these really small third party guys.

707
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,000
They're still releasing things, but no major companies supporting that system anymore.

708
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ironically, same with the Wii U, but you know, Hey, uh, I don't know.

709
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's, I don't, if they're thinking that turning off online is going to get people to, you

710
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
know, force them into buying a Wii U, then I don't think that's going to happen.

711
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,600
I think if anything, it's just a kind of save some money.

712
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm not, I know there's a lot of people that want to shout conspiracy theory and all this

713
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
stuff.

714
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm not necessarily convinced that's the case.

715
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,120
I kind of think that was already the case when Nintendo started releasing these consoles

716
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,720
because the last two skews of the Wii didn't even have online in it.

717
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Right.

718
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,520
The Wii U friendly mini Wiis or whatever that didn't, that was just the Wii mini and it

719
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
didn't even sell that well.

720
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,280
They, they released that very limited and that was it.

721
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,200
Um, I still think the Wii has online.

722
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,680
It's just that doesn't have backwards compatibility at the GameCube anymore.

723
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,400
I think the reality is people aren't playing these games online anymore because they've

724
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,580
all moved on to either Wii U or let's be real PlayStation and Xbox games.

725
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,160
You know, I don't, I just, and I think anybody that's still playing these games probably

726
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,040
is playing them in the same room or whatever.

727
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,600
You know, what's going to sadly happen with a lot of this stuff and I think this might

728
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,920
be the case is, you know, um, there are pretty capable Wii emulators out there that have

729
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,560
online, I think support or for multiplayer or something.

730
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,720
That might be the option is that they do it that way.

731
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Some sort of tunneling.

732
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:58,400
Um, I had mentioned before like, uh, for the Xbox and Xbox 360, I think PSP and GameCube,

733
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,360
they have options there called tunneling programs and basically it tricks the system into thinking

734
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,340
that it's doing like a system linker land game, but instead it's going over the internet.

735
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,000
And so you kind of peer with other people that way, but it connects via land.

736
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,920
See they, cause they have that with the GameCube, although it wasn't a feature that a lot of

737
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,240
people use, like for example, with Double Dash, but you know, the Wii never had that.

738
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,320
There was no land games on the Wii.

739
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
Right.

740
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,640
Um, well, and that's, that's the only bummer of this to me.

741
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,060
I mean, I can accept the fact that really nobody's playing these games online anymore,

742
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,520
so it's time for them to come down.

743
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,000
And if I really wanted to play Mario Kart Wii online, then I probably should have been

744
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,640
doing that the past three years.

745
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,380
I'm sure Nintendo is looking at reports and there's, there's so few people that are playing

746
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,680
these games online, it's not cost effective to keep the servers going.

747
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,760
I get that.

748
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,040
But the part of me that loves classic games, as we talk about a lot here on Orange Launch

749
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,840
Radio, classic gaming, the part of me that loves classic games is a little bit disappointed

750
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,020
that nobody will ever be able to play a game of Mario Kart, I mean, after May, will be

751
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,060
able to play a game of Mario Kart Wii over the internet, at least through any type of

752
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
official means.

753
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,240
I mean, you're going to have to hack a system like you're talking about or, or do emulators

754
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,800
or some type of, you know, underground things in order to do that.

755
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,400
That's, that's the only part of it that's a little bit disappointing to me.

756
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,320
I mean, I'll get over that, but that's the only bummer is that, you know, in 10, 15 years

757
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,440
when we want to look back on gaming's history, the way we look back fondly on a lot of our

758
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,960
NES games and, and, you know, Genesis games, Atari games of the past, we're not going to

759
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
be able to do that completely with these internet enabled games.

760
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,000
But, I mean, this is, this is a complaint that isn't limited in Nintendo.

761
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,680
It's something, I mean, obviously EA pulls servers down all the time and so on and so

762
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
on.

763
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
So.

764
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Yeah.

765
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,000
So, uh, yeah, I guess Nintendo's just following the trend in that regard, but, uh, yeah, I

766
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,120
mean, there are some games though on the DS that, you know, haven't really seen any type

767
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
of re-imagining.

768
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,120
I know Bobby was talking a lot about clubhouse games tonight.

769
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,640
Um, Allen had brought up, was it Pokemon puzzle league or was it, no, that was a Nintendo

770
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,400
64 game, that puzzle planet puzzle league or same type of thing, but it was on the DS,

771
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,600
you know, those types of games don't really exist on the 3DS, at least yet.

772
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,280
Ooh, Loki, here's a tinfoil hat thought.

773
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,040
Tell me what you think.

774
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,280
Aren't DS games supposed to be coming to the Wii U virtual console?

775
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
That is true.

776
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you see where I'm going with this?

777
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you think they will have online enabled?

778
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Uh, if, uh, probably, um, if, you know, I don't know, probably, um, but once again with

779
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,480
the DS though, although they don't have a tunneling program available, anything that

780
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,360
can play, you can play locally, should be able to connect over, um, the internet if

781
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,160
someone finishes the tunneling program for that.

782
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,120
But yeah, I see what you're saying is that, you know, maybe they're going to add, uh,

783
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,820
you know, multi- online multiplayer to DS games.

784
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,280
I would like to hope that that's going to be something that they do, although they tend

785
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,680
to go the lazy route with a lot of these things and not add features like that.

786
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,480
They just kind of put the bare minimum, okay, games on, you know, virtual console.

787
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
That's it.

788
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,320
Still, it's, it's one of those questions you got to wonder about, and Bobby Blackwolf

789
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,040
and Chad says, I don't think they'll have online enabled because they're shutting off

790
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,440
the servers, but what if, what if they decide to release Metroid Prime Hunters?

791
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,920
I really think they should bring back online for something like that.

792
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,360
Like I, I, you can't sell an emulated copy of the game without really giving you the

793
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
full experience, right?

794
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,260
Because, you know, it will have been at that point, what, a good five, six, seven years

795
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,020
since that game originally first came out by the time they released this on virtual

796
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,020
console.

797
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,660
I don't know, just throwing it out there, throwing it out there.

798
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,260
Tigerclaw wants to say, don't worry, Mario Kart 7 has race courses from Mario Kart Wii.

799
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,980
Then soon, Mario Kart 8 will have race courses from the Wii and 3DS version.

800
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,140
Nintendo likes to recycle the old tracks in each iteration.

801
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,580
That is a true point, Tigerclaw, but it is selections, and of course, your favorite track

802
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,060
never seems to make the cut, now does it?

803
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,020
Maybe it does, but for a lot of people, they always go, well, they should have had this

804
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
track in the game.

805
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,380
Of course, it would be very interesting if they decide to do DLC.

806
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,820
I mean, think about it, couldn't Mario Kart 8 feasibly have every Mario Kart course ever

807
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
made?

808
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
They could just do it through DLC?

809
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,460
They won't do that, because they're remaking all the tracks.

810
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,260
Like even they have one from the Game Boy Advance or whatever, and it looks completely

811
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,460
different now, because they've completely changed it up.

812
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,460
So I don't think they're going to go back and remake all the tracks.

813
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,060
The problem, they may have like a DLC pack, but that's it.

814
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,620
Maybe that's even just more characters, they might not even go the route of making more

815
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,620
courses.

816
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,500
Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here that has to do with Nintendo and

817
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,860
some of the things that they should or they shouldn't be doing.

818
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,580
This is a comment that really spread around the internet this week from Seth Fisher, who's

819
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,500
a big hedge fund manager in Asia.

820
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,900
So he's of the investor sort, and investors haven't been making a lot of great comments

821
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,380
about Nintendo lately, but this one is one of the ones that takes the cake.

822
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,740
Because they say Nintendo has a huge library of casual games, and so they should get to

823
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,820
smartphone and tablet-based gaming, right?

824
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
So we've heard this one before, right?

825
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,820
But here's the quote.

826
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,820
Quote, Nintendo needs to embrace this thematic change in consumer demand, behavior, and expectations

827
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
to stay relevant.

828
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,700
It is readily apparent that the standard elasticity of demand principle no longer applies in the

829
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,980
consumer entertainment market when access requires the purchase of a physical project.

830
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,380
As the holder of what is arguably the largest library of casual games, Nintendo is well

831
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,540
placed to make an immediate entry into mobile.

832
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,900
Okay, well, that's fine, but then this led into talk about, well, you know, because you

833
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,180
see in Candy Crush Saga, they get billions of dollars, what was it, $1.9 billion in revenue

834
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,740
or whatever it was they made.

835
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:54,980
What if we just had it where you could pay 99 cents to make Mario jump a little higher?

836
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,740
And like my head exploded hearing that, especially with all this talk of Donkey Kong Country

837
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,900
this week and how insanely difficult it is on the Wii U.

838
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,540
I mean, that's part of the experience.

839
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:11,460
I mean, Nintendo makes A plus platformers and for a reason and suddenly changing that

840
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,660
formula where, oh, Mario can jump just a little bit higher for 99 cents is really gonna, that's

841
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,660
shitty.

842
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,420
That's somebody who does not get it.

843
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,420
Yeah, right.

844
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,180
Who's not, who does not get the point of having a game.

845
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,860
People like this tend to loop video games.

846
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,740
See, there's a key in here.

847
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,020
He just wants to exploit a market and not make a good product.

848
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,820
Well, the problem is these folks that are tunnel visioned here, which I understand the

849
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,340
goal is to make money.

850
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
That's what investment is.

851
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,340
He wants your company to make money.

852
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
I get that.

853
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,700
But when we get really tunnel visioned, we, we start to think that, oh, Mario, Candy Crush,

854
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,700
the same thing.

855
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:54,060
No, not even close.

856
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,380
I mean, for better or worse, at least Nintendo has got way better clout amongst gamers and

857
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:06,500
there's a certain expectation from a Nintendo product than there is, you know, King.

858
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,740
You have something that's only looking on the money making aspect of it.

859
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,100
You're going to eventually get too many jaded consumers who aren't going to put their investment

860
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,200
in the product.

861
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,700
They want something that's going to be fun, that is a game to enjoy, then they're going

862
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,700
to spend the money on it.

863
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,380
You know, how many of these different clones out there that are just, you know, revenue

864
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:33,020
monsters really get as successful as some of these little single ones do and then people

865
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,020
forget about it.

866
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Move on to the next one.

867
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,940
I think another thing these investors tend to forget is that Candy Crush Saga is a flash

868
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,440
in the fucking pan.

869
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,500
It's a flash in the pan, just like Farmville and you notice how quickly Zynga went up and

870
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
now they fell.

871
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,620
I mean, they're not out of business per se, but Zynga has come down from their peak.

872
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,340
We know that the same, the bubble is going to burst on Candy Crush Saga as well.

873
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,900
In fact, I would argue it's already beginning to burst because of all that negative publicity

874
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,900
they got.

875
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,140
We'll get into that a little later in the show, but my point is that bubble is going

876
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,860
to burst.

877
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,280
Now maybe for an investor, that's not such a bad thing because it's like you're trying

878
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,780
to ride the waves of the ocean.

879
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,220
You try to catch a company, right?

880
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,580
It's going to go up and then you sell, sell, sell, sell, sell right before it's going to

881
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
go down.

882
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,140
You get onto the next big flash in the pan.

883
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,660
That's how, you know, a lot of the stock market works, but that's not what we expect.

884
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,020
Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.

885
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,140
I really don't, even if you're the biggest Nintendo critic in the world and you hate

886
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,620
the Wii U, you've got to admit, Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.

887
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,620
There's a certain expectation.

888
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,660
There's a certain expectation you have out of Nintendo and I think that's why people

889
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,900
are disappointed in the Wii U.

890
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,660
Loki, any thoughts before we move on?

891
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,380
This is why, you know, companies tend not to listen to, you know, each investor because

892
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,660
you put money down in the company and all of a sudden you think that you run it.

893
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,780
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

894
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,260
I think it's, it's a dumb idea.

895
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,660
They already own the handheld console market.

896
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,220
I don't think that they need to really change what they're doing.

897
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,220
All right.

898
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,220
Fair enough.

899
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,540
Let's move on to something else besides Nintendo.

900
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,540
Dark Soccer.

901
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
What do you have for us?

902
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,420
Well, um, the, uh, we've brought this up before about Steam, uh, starting their, uh, family

903
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,900
op, the Steam Family Sharing and, uh, well, it's now out of beta.

904
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,900
It's official.

905
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,900
You can do the Steam Family Sharing.

906
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,980
So basically, it lets for, uh, anyone who, you know, is family or trusted friend or something

907
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:33,700
like that, that has, uh, access to the different games, um, be it PC, be it Mac or Linux, um,

908
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:39,700
via Steam, they can share their libraries with each other, um, and so they can basically

909
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,820
share their progress over the Steam Cloud, which, I mean, like for me and Dan, we have

910
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,820
a few overlapping games.

911
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,820
This would actually be great because then we can, you know, share our games with each

912
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,420
other, um, instead of each of us both having to buy five different versions of Strider

913
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,740
like we did, and I haven't played it yet, um, but it's pretty neat.

914
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,340
I mean, they've got all the details on it on their website, and I'm thinking that he

915
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,940
and I should give it a try this week.

916
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,500
Something really fascinating about this feature that I find, and maybe this is just my own

917
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:12,260
experiences, but it's, it's horrifically underused, like, I, I, I've been in the beta for a while,

918
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,780
and I was even telling friends of mine, like, yeah, you want to check out that game?

919
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,460
Because I, I'll get the Steam thing set up on your computer at some point, but they never,

920
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,460
we never do it.

921
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,620
Like, they never really want to play it that bad enough, and even Alan and I are still

922
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,300
buying, like, two copies of the same game, maybe not as bad as we used to, but, like,

923
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,020
you know, he has access to my Steam library.

924
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,620
I don't think he really uses it, like, and not, you know, I'm just saying, I think it's

925
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,300
an underused feature right now.

926
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,340
It's really weird because I think there was that perception out there that, oh, people

927
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,420
are gonna share their library with 10 different people, and, you know, that's why Steam has

928
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,420
to lock them out, but, like, that, at least in my experience, that isn't happening.

929
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,460
I have, like, offered up my library, and no, I'm not gonna give it to any random listener,

930
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,300
but trusted friends of mine that kind of don't seem to care.

931
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,700
It's because we all have 200-some games that we haven't played yet.

932
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,340
And maybe that's, maybe that's really it, Loki.

933
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,620
I wouldn't doubt that that's an issue.

934
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:06,580
Well, I'm, I'm just gonna enable mine for Dan anyway, you know, because he, I've had

935
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,060
some games that I've told him to check out, and he just said, oh, well, I don't want to

936
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,780
buy it, so now you can check him out.

937
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,020
Yeah, and, and, and Alan and I really need to set a rule, quote-unquote, that we don't

938
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,020
buy two of the same game anymore with this.

939
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,180
Unless you've got multiplayer and you both want to play together.

940
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,180
Yeah, exactly.

941
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
Exactly.

942
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,300
Something like that the case, or whatever, but, you know.

943
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Yeah.

944
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,940
But, I mean, it's, it's still, regardless of how utilized it's gonna be, I still think

945
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,340
it's a good, it's a good thing to have.

946
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:42,780
It gives more value to individual purchases, and it will make, um, honestly, I think it

947
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,460
might alleviate the need to have so many consistent sales, at least for big titles.

948
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,560
It make it, uh, you get, you get more value out of the game, so the bigger titles will

949
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,860
sell while they're still closer to full price.

950
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,980
All right.

951
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,900
I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask the chatters about this in a minute, but I'll move on, because

952
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,300
I know we have more Steam news, and I want to come back and ask the chatters a question.

953
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,460
So let's go to Loki.

954
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,100
So I'm surprised that this wasn't a thing in the first place, but apparently there was

955
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:17,640
a big elaborate process in order to, you know, put your titles on sale if you were someone

956
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,580
selling a game on Steam.

957
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:26,260
Well now they have some sort of modifications to that with the new Steam Work tools that

958
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:32,260
allows you to configure discounts for custom sale periods, or opt-in to take part in an

959
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,900
upcoming week-long sale.

960
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,980
And you can also configure when the discounts will start, or if they start at a specific

961
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,500
time, or how long to run, and that kind of thing.

962
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,800
That seems like something that should have been there in the first place, but now I like

963
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,080
the idea of it because now it gets people, you know, on Steam checking it, you know,

964
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,460
all the time instead of just waiting for, you know, a holiday sale or something.

965
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,220
Yeah, I kind of thought this was already a thing, like, I kind of didn't realize that

966
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,860
publishers didn't really have control over that, although it does seem like every sale

967
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,120
that we see on Steam is very timed.

968
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,780
Like there's always the week sale, the weekend sale, the holiday sales, you know, and so

969
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,780
on and so on.

970
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,780
There's not really, like, random sales, and that's what you're going to start seeing now,

971
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,780
right?

972
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,780
I guess, yeah.

973
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,020
So, I don't know, that was just kind of interesting.

974
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,420
Hold on, before you get to the next Steam story, I've got one thing here I want to ask

975
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,380
our folks, and I'm actually going to make this a live poll, because, you know, I love

976
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,380
my live polls.

977
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:41,540
So, we're going to ask the audience over at live.vognetwork.com a question right now,

978
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,660
and that question is quite simple.

979
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,700
Have you used Steam Family Sharing?

980
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,180
And I try to really limit the number of answers here because I want a clear picture.

981
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,380
Yes, I use it regularly.

982
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,140
I used it once.

983
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
Or nope.

984
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,500
Answer now, live listeners, you've got to be logged in over at live.vognetwork.com and

985
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,220
it'll show up at the bottom of the screen.

986
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,980
I'm only going to leave this open for a couple minutes, so hurry up and vote over at live.vognetwork.com.

987
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,980
Loki, back to you.

988
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:17,500
Alright, and then the other thing is, finally, the Steam music is going into beta, and so

989
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,820
they've, I guess, put out the first round of invites, and I guess for a limited time

990
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:32,780
you'll be able to stream some MP3s, I guess, currently only MP3s, and then later they're

991
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:40,780
going to add more formats, and I guess users can purchase game soundtracks or other things

992
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,780
like that.

993
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,780
So that's kind of neat.

994
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,100
I guess you're going to start selling music as well, and then allow you to, you know,

995
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,100
I don't know.

996
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,860
For me, I don't think this would be a big, like, something I would want to use just because,

997
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:00,420
you know, I'm playing on PC, I can just play music in the background.

998
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,180
But I guess with this being tied in, you know, it would like maybe shut off the music in

999
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,900
the game or something to that effect.

1000
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,900
I don't know.

1001
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:14,660
I just don't know what the advantage would be going this route versus, you know, just

1002
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:19,740
playing music on my computer.

1003
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,180
Is it something maybe for the Steam Box?

1004
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,940
Like kind of like a long-term vision type of thing?

1005
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:31,620
Well, it is something that's limited to SteamOS and big picture mode, but I don't know.

1006
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:37,000
Apparently they're going to have an interface also that's going to be for just the regular

1007
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,360
desktop version, but right now it's just for those two versions, so.

1008
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,360
I don't know.

1009
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,200
Once again, you know, not a feature I even really use on consoles either, so.

1010
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,200
I don't know.

1011
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,200
I don't know what the big deal is.

1012
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,680
I guess it's just, you know, it allows them to sell more things.

1013
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,840
Jason in our chat has a perspective.

1014
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,000
Our buddy VXJ6V says, Steam music exists for one reason.

1015
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,700
Valve needed a player in SteamOS.

1016
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,260
Steam music as it stands is kind of bunk, in my opinion.

1017
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,260
I guess that makes sense.

1018
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:13,700
Yeah, I mean, when these Steam Boxes come out, my assumption is they need to be able

1019
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,900
to play media as a part of it, right?

1020
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:22,540
Because a lot of people razz the fact that the PS4 won't play an audio CD, I think.

1021
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
So.

1022
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,540
Anyhow.

1023
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:30,180
All right, we'll do one more story and then we'll go to the results of the poll here.

1024
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,600
So we've been talking about Steam.

1025
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,560
Let's talk about sharing of a different nature because some big news came out this week about

1026
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,200
Twitch TV and how they're going to integrate with the Xbox One.

1027
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,160
Now, a lot of folks have been anticipating when this is going to happen, when this is

1028
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,200
going to happen, and some folks thinking that Microsoft may wait until E3, but it looks

1029
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,560
like we are going to get it a little bit sooner.

1030
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,520
We're going to get Twitch streaming on the Xbox One on March 11th, and this is kind of

1031
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,120
timed a little bit key because that is when Titanfall is supposed to come out.

1032
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
So make no mistake.

1033
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,600
I'm sure the rush was, hey, if we can get this enabled in time for Titanfall, that'll

1034
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,840
be a lot of free publicity for that game through the Xbox One Twitch integration.

1035
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,360
So they are working on that.

1036
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:17,560
Now, the nice thing about Twitch on the Xbox One versus the PlayStation 4, on the PlayStation

1037
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,880
4, those cameras are still impossible to find.

1038
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Let me tell you.

1039
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,460
I don't know what the hell's going on there.

1040
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,700
I thought after the Japanese launch it might get easier, but no, it seems like they stopped

1041
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,280
making them or something.

1042
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,240
But with the Xbox One, that ain't going to be an issue because everybody's got a camera

1043
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,240
in their house.

1044
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Also, it seems like they've kind of taken the Twitch integration to the next level than

1045
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,560
what you see on PlayStation 4 because you're going to have that chat room on the side that

1046
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,040
looks a little more like it does on Twitch TV where you have the emote icons, the different

1047
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,120
colors by people's names.

1048
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,120
I don't know if this is to maybe enable some of the subscription things where subscribed

1049
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,320
users get their own emote icons or what, but there's that.

1050
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,320
The CEO of Twitch, Emmet Shear, told the Associated Press, it is a complete integration.

1051
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,260
It's exciting because we've never had the ability to broadcast from a console like this

1052
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,440
with such a deep level of integration.

1053
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,000
The concept of being able to join a broadcaster's party is really cool, and it's another step

1054
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,920
in the direction of interacting more closely with broadcasters.

1055
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,720
No word yet if PlayStation 4's version will be patched or updated to try and compete with

1056
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,720
this a little bit.

1057
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,640
We will see.

1058
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,480
There will also be, and this is kind of a big deal, they're also going to be able to

1059
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,040
archive the streams on the Xbox One, which is something you can do with Twitch on the

1060
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
PC.

1061
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,280
For whatever reason, PlayStation 4 streaming will not archive broadcasts right now, and

1062
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,740
when pressed for comments, Sony wouldn't make a comment on if this is going to change.

1063
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,880
I sort of think they're going to have to be pressured into it, but my thought was, I thought

1064
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,440
that was all on Twitch's side, but maybe there's something where Sony's providing some of the

1065
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,440
oomph?

1066
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,040
I really don't know.

1067
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,680
To start streaming to Twitch, apparently all you have to do is say Xbox broadcast, which

1068
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,940
I'm sure will open up the Xbox Ones to all sorts of trolling, but we'll see.

1069
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,960
So there you go.

1070
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,100
I know you don't own an Xbox One Loki, but let's say hypothetically you did.

1071
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,080
Would you be excited about this Twitch sharing?

1072
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,960
Would you be using this, or?

1073
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,420
I don't know if I'd be using it.

1074
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,240
Even if I had a PlayStation 4, I don't know if I'd be using it.

1075
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,240
Maybe.

1076
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
I don't know.

1077
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,240
This is a good time.

1078
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,120
I've done a limited streaming on the PlayStation 4.

1079
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,280
It works really well.

1080
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,560
Like streaming Final Fantasy XIV from my PlayStation 4 is better than the PC, but that just might

1081
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,040
be the fact that my PC's five years old as well.

1082
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,360
I guess if someone really wants to watch me play games, I mean, sure, why not?

1083
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,640
Alright, well before we get to the next story, let's get to the results of the live poll.

1084
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,040
We asked our live listeners, have you used Steam Family Sharing?

1085
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,160
That was the question, and the three options were, yes, I use it regularly.

1086
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,960
I used it once, or nope.

1087
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,320
Get this, guys.

1088
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,720
Eighty-two percent, no.

1089
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,080
Never used it.

1090
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Fourteen percent, I used it once.

1091
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,680
And only single digits, probably like one or two people saying, yes, I use it regularly.

1092
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,040
Fascinating.

1093
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,920
So there you go.

1094
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Interesting.

1095
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,360
So much hype for such a feature that people really don't seem to be using at all.

1096
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Very interesting.

1097
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
Just pointing that out.

1098
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,080
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

1099
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:27,000
Well this was actually a big rumor going that Blockbuster had been licensed out, that Dish

1100
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,440
Network licensed Blockbuster brand to Crash Entertainment.

1101
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,640
This has actually been determined to be incorrect.

1102
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,280
The story actually came out, it was a few days ago, and then it was updated to say that

1103
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,200
Dish said, no, we haven't done this.

1104
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,440
Dish Network and Blockbuster have not entered any sort of licensing agreement.

1105
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,400
This is for Blockbuster in the UK, by the way.

1106
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:01,520
And that Crash Entertainment said that it had a claim that it licensed Blockbuster,

1107
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,000
and then it looked like it was actually not true either.

1108
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,660
However, they said they wanted to open ten new Blockbuster stores in 2014.

1109
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:15,480
It was on their website, and it has been removed from their website.

1110
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,440
So no Blockbuster, sorry.

1111
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,880
So Blockbuster was going to be a thing, and now it's not a thing anymore.

1112
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Yeah.

1113
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,960
Subtle would interest some people, you know, in case you wanted to get a, you know...

1114
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,240
Aren't there still stores here and there?

1115
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,240
No?

1116
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,240
No, God, yeah.

1117
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,680
I guess I was thinking the one that I used to see over on, I know this is going to be

1118
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,160
lost on non-local people, but there was one over on Greenback and Hazel for the longest

1119
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,160
time.

1120
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,160
No, not anymore.

1121
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,160
It's not there anymore, huh?

1122
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,160
Yeah, it's closed.

1123
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
Wow.

1124
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,160
That one that was near my house is gone too.

1125
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,560
And I mean, we had a friend who was a manager at one, and yeah, they're gone.

1126
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,560
Interesting.

1127
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
I didn't realize they were all gone.

1128
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,040
I mean, it makes sense, sadly.

1129
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,760
Yeah, that ship sank.

1130
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,760
My first minimum wage job was at a video store, not Blockbuster, but a local chain, which

1131
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,240
is Blockbuster and Hollywood put that chain under that I used to work for.

1132
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,000
And then, you know, now it's kind of interesting that Hollywood went under and now Blockbuster

1133
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
went under.

1134
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,800
So it's just, that's how technology can really change the commerce in our world.

1135
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,800
So interesting.

1136
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:16,280
Alrighty, we have some more stories for you guys, but first we're going to travel around

1137
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,760
the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming out in a game store

1138
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,760
near you.

1139
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,760
And, Logie?

1140
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,220
Not a whole ton this week.

1141
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:28,320
It's pretty much just South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1142
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:36,240
Zoo Tycoon, I think, is getting a disc release this week on Xbox One, and they have an XCOM

1143
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,560
Enemy Unknown Complete Edition coming out on PC, kind of a re-release for that.

1144
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,560
That is it.

1145
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,200
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.

1146
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,080
PlayStation 4 is still laying on their launch lineup.

1147
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,840
There's no new games, really, until mid-March, so we've got a few weeks before we start seeing

1148
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,220
more on the PlayStation 4, but as a reminder, it is out in Japan, so they are eating up

1149
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,340
their launch content right now.

1150
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,780
On the PlayStation 3, however, a little different because we do have some releases, a lot of

1151
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,340
price reductions, actually.

1152
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:10,740
Injustice price reduction, Lord of the Rings, War in the North, F.E.A.R. 3, Biohazard 6,

1153
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:14,520
which of course is Resident Evil 6, lots and lots of price reductions, but we do have some

1154
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,520
new games.

1155
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,800
Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z, regular, special Ninja, and special Zombie is all coming out.

1156
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:27,500
I do not believe this is the same as, like, this isn't canon Ninja Gaiden series, is it?

1157
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,900
It looks like the art...

1158
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,180
It's a spinoff.

1159
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,360
It's like, um, it's done by the guy that did Resident Evil.

1160
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,740
Because it looks very cel-shaded manga style, so it's not like a part of the main Ninja

1161
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:42,300
Gaiden series, it's like a spinoff, cartoony, ultra-violent, it looks like blood everywhere

1162
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,580
from these pictures, and there's one picture where, I'm assuming this is Ryu or some type

1163
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:51,540
of relative, it's basically holding a decapitated cyborg head, yet there's red blood everywhere

1164
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,540
anyway.

1165
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,540
Anyway.

1166
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,540
Hey Rob, it's oil, it's machine oil.

1167
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,980
Oh, of course, of course, of course.

1168
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
Sure.

1169
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,220
For those of you guys that like to slash Zombie's Ninja Gaiden style, there you go, that is

1170
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,980
in Japan this week on March the 6th.

1171
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,440
Over on the Xbox 360, same thing, Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z seems to be the big release

1172
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,460
this week, but Biohazard 6 also getting a price reduction there if you missed that for

1173
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,520
whatever reason.

1174
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,680
On the PlayStation Vita, Luminous Electronic Symphony gets a price reduction, that of course

1175
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,180
was one of the launch titles.

1176
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:25,180
There's some new SKU coming out, the new slim model welcome box, I'm not sure what all that

1177
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,180
entails.

1178
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,380
I'm assuming it must have some different pack-in games, but that is something that is coming

1179
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:34,660
out in Japan, or that's like a PlayStation Plus, it looks like it comes with God Eater

1180
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:40,100
2, Terraria looks like it's in there, I'm trying to look for this really tiny box art,

1181
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,380
some type of baseball, one of the baseball simulators, it's just basically, you know,

1182
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,580
do they have PlayStation Plus in Japan, like we have it here, where they give all the free

1183
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,580
games?

1184
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,300
Yeah, I think they have it in Japan.

1185
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,420
I bet that's part of it, but anyhow, if you've been sitting on a Vita and you're waiting

1186
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,460
for some extra games, there you go.

1187
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,460
Waiting for it to hatch?

1188
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
I guess.

1189
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Sitting on a Vita?

1190
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
You need there to be tons of games out.

1191
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,460
There you go.

1192
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,580
Soul Sacrifice Delta also out this week in Japan, and let me check out the other handheld

1193
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:13,460
real quick, that would be the 3DS, the 3DS gets Doraemon, Shindobita no Damaekyuu Pekkon

1194
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:20,300
no, or excuse me, Pekkoto 5 Nin no Tankinatai comes out this week, cause you know, you love

1195
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,300
your Doraemon, right?

1196
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Doraemon!

1197
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,220
Doraemon is that, if you didn't know, is that-

1198
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,580
It's the little cat with no ears.

1199
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,580
Yeah, that blue cat you sometimes see.

1200
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,100
So Doraemon is so cute.

1201
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,760
So he gets a new game there on the 3DS this week.

1202
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,380
Also Anpanman Toa- What?

1203
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,620
I want this.

1204
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,620
I do not know what this is.

1205
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,620
It's Anpanman.

1206
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,620
No, you don't get it.

1207
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,620
It's Anpanman.

1208
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,620
Oh, excuse me.

1209
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,620
I don't get it.

1210
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,620
Please.

1211
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,620
I have a special love of Anpanman.

1212
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,620
Anpaneducate me, lady.

1213
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:55,340
It's a superhero made out of Anpan, which is a delicious, yeasty bread filled with red

1214
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,580
bean paste.

1215
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:03,300
I have a stuffed Anpanman in my art studio room.

1216
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,580
Okay, so what the hell is this game then?

1217
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,580
I don't see screenshots.

1218
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,580
He's a superhero.

1219
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,580
He's holding a pencil.

1220
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,580
Does he draw?

1221
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,580
I don't know what this one is.

1222
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,100
I don't care cause it's Anpanman and I want it, but I don't have a Japanese 3DS.

1223
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,380
And the 3DS is region lonk to womp womp.

1224
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,380
Yeah.

1225
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,380
No, I love Anpanman.

1226
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,380
He's so cute.

1227
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,380
All right.

1228
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,380
Well, there you go.

1229
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,380
Those are your Japanese releases.

1230
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:31,860
So I guess Dark Saga is going to try to convince Akuma JP to come over.

1231
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,860
Let me see your 3DS.

1232
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,300
I like a 3DS and some Anpanman.

1233
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,220
To be perfectly honest, we actually have a good place in Sacramento that makes fantastic

1234
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,220
Anpan.

1235
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:47,620
And then they also make little chocolate choco-pan in the shape of Anpanman's face, which I

1236
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,620
think is even more hilarious because they should actually make the Anpan in the shape

1237
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:54,260
of Anpanman's face, but nevermind.

1238
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,860
Meanwhile in the UK, Dark Sagra.

1239
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,260
Oh yeah, some stuff.

1240
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,780
On the 5th, we have Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition for PS4.

1241
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,260
And then on the 7th is Atelier, Escha, and Loggie.

1242
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,600
South Park, The Stick of Truth on Damned Near Everything Else, and The Dead Rising Collection

1243
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,460
on Xbox 360.

1244
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
And that's it.

1245
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,460
All right.

1246
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,580
All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of

1247
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,580
the week.

1248
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:20,580
Logie.

1249
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:27,260
So, real quick, King, the company behind Candy Crush Saga, they've withdrawn their trademark

1250
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,040
application for candy in the US.

1251
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,900
They do have Saga, though.

1252
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,900
That is all.

1253
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,900
They suck.

1254
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,580
So in other words, that bad publicity with the whole candy swipe thing really did them

1255
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,580
in?

1256
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,180
Because I kind of think that's what it was, but...

1257
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,180
Yeah, pretty much.

1258
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,940
Well, is this a good thing or a bad thing?

1259
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,980
I think it's kind of a loaded question.

1260
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,300
I don't see how you could say it's a bad thing, but humor me here.

1261
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,820
Is this a good thing or a bad thing that they lost that trademark over candy?

1262
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:05,220
I think it's a no one gives a shit anymore because they suck.

1263
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
I guess that's fair enough.

1264
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,220
The king is dead.

1265
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,220
Long live the king?

1266
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,220
No, no, wait, that's not how it works.

1267
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,540
No, no, long live the queen.

1268
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Why wouldn't you dare?

1269
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,900
No.

1270
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,900
No.

1271
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:20,900
They just need to go away.

1272
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,900
Okay.

1273
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Fair enough.

1274
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:23,900
All right.

1275
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Moving on.

1276
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,900
One more story for you guys.

1277
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,140
Actually, it's a couple of stories because it's updates.

1278
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,500
We've been talking about Nintendo systems a little bit tonight, and there are some updates

1279
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,940
to consider when it comes to the Wii U and the 3DS.

1280
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,700
A new update for the Wii U went out this week.

1281
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,700
It's version 4.0.3.

1282
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,260
Not a whole lot of features, but they do say overall system stability, minor adjustments

1283
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,700
to enhance the user experience.

1284
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,700
That's it.

1285
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,060
No word on was it maybe trying to patch out some type of exploit.

1286
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,260
I can't remember if we had an exploit article on the Wii U recently.

1287
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,300
I feel like we did or what they're really trying to do with this, but that is out now.

1288
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,300
Check that out, I guess.

1289
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,820
Otherwise, on the 3DS, same deal.

1290
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:10,060
Improvements to overall system stability and those same adjustments, so it's very curious

1291
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:13,660
what they could really be trying to do there unless they're prepping for something coming

1292
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,660
in the future, maybe to deliver these virtual console games or who knows, but a lot going

1293
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,660
on behind the scenes.

1294
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,060
Of course, the last big upgrade we got on the 3DS bridged the gap between the two, so

1295
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:28,140
maybe these firmware updates are to really fix all this with the homogenization of the

1296
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:33,340
Nintendo network IDs, and then Miiverse came to the 3DS in the last patch as well, so these

1297
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,660
seem to be tweaks to probably get the two to play nicely.

1298
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,380
It sounds likely.

1299
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,900
Although I didn't notice a problem, but you know, I'm sure somebody figured out a way

1300
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,900
to do that.

1301
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,900
There's always problems.

1302
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,900
People can fix that.

1303
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,900
Yeah.

1304
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,900
All right.

1305
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:55,380
Well, it is about that time where we go down a trip of memory lane, and there was a time

1306
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,260
back in the day you didn't get firmware upgrades to your system.

1307
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:01,580
When things broke, you blew on the cartridge and prayed.

1308
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,740
That was a firmware update.

1309
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,440
It's the classic game of the week.

1310
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,680
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

1311
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,240
you kids, you totally ignored this flipping game, now go play it.

1312
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:20,400
Put down your freaking Call of Duty games and go play a real classic.

1313
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,520
Dark Soccer is the classic game of the week.

1314
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:31,440
The game is Rad Racer, which came out in Japan as Highway Star, and it was done by Square

1315
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,160
for the Famicom in 1987.

1316
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:41,200
And you drive a Ferrari 328 or an F1 racing machine through a different race course.

1317
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:47,440
And the music for this game was done by Uematsu, so tune up a little bit.

1318
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:55,440
It's just not familiar also to people who've been struck by anything else.

1319
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,440
It's not familiar?

1320
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,440
Anyway.

1321
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,880
I did not realize those two tied together.

1322
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
Really?

1323
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,000
The 20XD6 thing when he does the anime thing, and he picks the Rad Racer theme as his ending

1324
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,120
song for his little Strong Bad anime.

1325
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,600
It's been so long.

1326
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
20XD6.

1327
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Oh my gosh.

1328
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,680
Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?

1329
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,080
Hey, Strong Bad, I want to be the guy.

1330
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,080
No.

1331
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:25,920
Anyway, so basically, you just go through driving the game, kind of pole position-like.

1332
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,920
You can get side swipes, you can crash into stuff, and you can actually crash by hitting

1333
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,600
other cars too at higher levels.

1334
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,920
And you also can have your time run out.

1335
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,760
So basically, it's just still going through, just trying to get from one end of the course

1336
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,760
to the other.

1337
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:50,680
And in Japan, it had a 3D mode that you could use the 3D glasses that came out over there.

1338
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:58,160
And also, Square had used that same type of 3D technology with 3D World Runner.

1339
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:05,560
And so, the F1 car, by the way, is supposed to look like the Lotus 99T Formula 1 car,

1340
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,320
but everyone plays the Ferrari, I mean, hello.

1341
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:16,720
So yeah, this was, I mean, pretty much one of the most popular racing games by the time

1342
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,720
it came out.

1343
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,720
There's been other ones that's been out since.

1344
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,680
It was also designed by Sakaguchi, I'm just saying, yeah.

1345
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,920
It was also, you know, with...

1346
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,000
I didn't realize how much ties to Final Fantasy this game had, but I guess it makes sense.

1347
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yep.

1348
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,240
Well, let's see, like I said, this was one of the few titles that used the Famicom 3D

1349
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,240
system that had the glasses.

1350
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:48,240
And this was actually the game that, at the time, the Square owner, who was Masafumi Miyamoto,

1351
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:55,960
used to demonstrate how the 3D programming that was done by Nasser Gabelli, who was the

1352
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,080
programmer for the game.

1353
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,840
And there was a North American exclusive sequel, Rad Racer 2, that had...

1354
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,720
It wasn't really as good as the first Rad Racer, I mean, there's really only one Rad

1355
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Racer.

1356
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Which, I actually like the Japanese name better, because Highway Star, you know, there was

1357
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,240
the song Highway Star, and anyway.

1358
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:23,680
This was ranked number 8 on Nintendo Power's Top 30 poll.

1359
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,600
It's just one of the better racing games that's been out.

1360
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,700
Like I said, Rad Racer 2, it came out in 1990, it was kind of crap.

1361
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,000
It played a lot the same, but it really was not as good.

1362
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,240
It had like a different preview indicator and a turbo boost, no, not good.

1363
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,780
So yeah, now the 3D that came out in this game, as I mentioned in another one, it was

1364
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:50,800
used by 3D Worldrunner, but 3D Worldrunner was not as great of a sale as a seller, and

1365
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,960
so this is actually what led up to Final Fantasy coming out, done by, you know, again, we had

1366
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,520
Sakaguchi and Uematsu behind this.

1367
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,400
So it was their final attempt, right?

1368
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,360
There was a scene also from this movie that showed up in The Wizard, and that was a scene

1369
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,840
where Lucas uses the Power Glove to play through the first stage of the game.

1370
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,760
Did you ever actually get to play these games with the 3D glasses?

1371
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,640
Because I don't know how many of you got to actually experience these games with 3D glasses,

1372
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:24,640
but I actually, a friend of mine had Rad Racer with the 3D glasses, so I remember playing

1373
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,680
it, and I gotta say, the 3D in Rad Racer actually wasn't very good.

1374
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,080
I mean, the game, it kind of doesn't lend itself very well to 3D, which I know sounds

1375
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,760
weird because it's a racing game, but you already kind of have that perspective.

1376
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,040
Now, 3D Worldrunner, on the other hand, which hopefully you'll cover in another week, because

1377
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,120
that was a pretty fun game, the 3D in that game was much better, I thought.

1378
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,680
That's just, that's my personal opinion.

1379
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:52,680
Well, just a little bit more about this too.

1380
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,240
And I like what the article says, that using the Power Glove to play the game was actually

1381
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:01,320
considered a feat because of how unreliable the Power Glove was.

1382
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:07,320
And Rad Racer is Uematsu's 11th work in video game music composition, and that song was

1383
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:14,560
used with vocals for Stinkoman, which was the anime parody that Strong Bad did for Homestar

1384
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,560
Runner.

1385
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,520
It was a Strong Bad email.

1386
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,480
And then there was actually a song released by a group called Workdrugs, a selectropop

1387
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,840
group called Rad Racer, and it has footage from Rad Racer 2 used in it.

1388
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,240
So there we go, Rad Racer.

1389
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,720
You know, I'll thank Dan for this one because I had forgotten about it.

1390
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,920
Not forgotten about it, but just like, I thought I had done it, and every time he suggested

1391
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,920
it, I was like, oh, I've done Rad Racer, I've done Rad Racer.

1392
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,080
No, I haven't done Rad Racer, now I have, so he can hush.

1393
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,080
There it is.

1394
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,040
It is rad, it's so rad.

1395
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:50,080
Your classic video game of the week, Rad Racer.

1396
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,520
But the 3D, totally overrated in this game, that was one thing that, no, it sounds a lot

1397
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,000
cooler than it really was in execution, just saying.

1398
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,200
Hey, Stinkoman, I hear you're the guy, but I want to be the guy too.

1399
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,200
Uh, okay.

1400
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,800
No way, you're just a kid.

1401
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,320
How old is Strong Bad, aren't those things like 10 years old now at this point?

1402
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,320
Something like that.

1403
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,320
So sad.

1404
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,680
I can't believe I still, actually I'll tell you how I remember it because I just watched

1405
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,680
it before.

1406
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,840
Which I'm not, I'm not knocking, that shit was hilarious and like, you know, to find

1407
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,280
the internet a few years ago, but it's kind of sad.

1408
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,480
I was raised by a cup of coffee.

1409
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,120
Remember the Homestar Runner game that was out on, like it was on the Wii and I think

1410
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
PC?

1411
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,120
Yeah.

1412
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,000
It's the same company that brought us The Walking Dead years later.

1413
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Yeah.

1414
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Funny, funny, funny.

1415
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,320
All right, anyhow, we are going to take a break guys, when we come back there is plenty

1416
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,120
more show to come, including your live phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype,

1417
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,280
Orange Lounge Radio.

1418
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:53,400
Also some more stories coming up in part B, including some surprise layoffs.

1419
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,920
That's never any fun news to talk about, but you know, we got to talk about that because

1420
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,180
it was, it was a real shocker.

1421
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:03,480
In better news, we'll talk about, how about a big media expansion for a free to play game?

1422
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,000
I think that's a little bit happier news.

1423
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,200
We'll talk about that when Orange Auditorino comes back right after this.

1424
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:22,040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on March the 2nd of 2014 with the 542nd

1425
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:28,280
episode of our program and lots of fun stuff in part A. We had a really kind of Nintendo

1426
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,040
heavy first half of the show, but it seemed like they had a lot of news going on and some

1427
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,360
updates on Steam as well with a fun live poll and so forth.

1428
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,720
If you're just joining us because you gave up on that award show that's on TV, maybe

1429
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,560
you're pissed off that Miyazaki did not win best animated film as some people on my Facebook

1430
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,280
friends list seemed to be, but I kind of, kind of, usually those Disney movies tend

1431
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,280
to win everything, right?

1432
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,720
Frozen won of course and no surprise there, but you know, sure there's a lot of nerds

1433
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,200
little pissed off that Miyazaki didn't win, although I do want to see his movie.

1434
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,520
I don't get out to see a lot of movies, but all the stuff they put out of his is really

1435
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,520
good.

1436
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,520
So I want to go out and see that.

1437
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,520
So we'll see.

1438
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,840
Anyway, we are going to get into some rapid fire news and of course your calls a little

1439
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,080
later in the program as well as your emails to our new mailbag over at participate at

1440
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,080
orangelawnsradio.com.

1441
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:18,240
We'll get to the very first email in our new mailbag in just a little bit and joining us

1442
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,240
over the Skyfline, Loki.

1443
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,240
Sorry.

1444
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,240
It's okay.

1445
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,240
Background noise.

1446
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26,240
If you guys hear random background noise, that's what's going on.

1447
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,600
Loki won't be on Skype forever.

1448
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,520
He will come back to the studio soon, probably around the time we move, but obviously baby

1449
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,200
and family take priority.

1450
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:40,000
So we are having him, having him work from home and he's going to work with some rapid

1451
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,480
fire news right now.

1452
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,560
Yes, I am.

1453
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,560
So March PlayStation Plus, they have some more free stuff, of course, for instant game

1454
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,520
collection, including Tomb Raider.

1455
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,520
So that's pretty cool.

1456
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,320
And then a lot of other PlayStation Network games included with that.

1457
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,480
Thomas Was Alone, Lone Survivor, The Director's Cut, and that's on PlayStation 3.

1458
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,880
Vita is getting Unit 13 and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.

1459
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,600
And then also, I guess, they're operating some sales, I guess, on Hotline, Miami Escape

1460
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:19,800
Plan, Flower, Killzone, Mercenary Tales, Mozilla, Dragon's Crown, and Ni No Kuni, as well as

1461
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,960
other things.

1462
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,840
No PlayStation 4 stuff, though.

1463
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,040
I am sorry, Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition is going to be PlayStation 4.

1464
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,440
I almost missed that there.

1465
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,960
Yay, two zombie games back to back.

1466
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,680
There you go, yeah.

1467
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:41,560
Atlus has confirmed four new Persona games for North America.

1468
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,880
So that's kind of cool.

1469
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,760
They're going to be getting, let's see, I wonder if those are the same ones that they

1470
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,480
announced not too long ago.

1471
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:55,240
Persona Q Shadow Labyrinth for 3DS, which is supposed to be Fall 2014.

1472
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:01,440
Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is going to be, I guess, a re-release of Persona 4 Arena

1473
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,840
that's enhanced, that's going to be coming out in 2014 as well, towards the end of the

1474
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,840
year.

1475
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:12,540
2015, they've got Persona 4 Dancing All Night, which I guess is a music game.

1476
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:19,160
And Persona 5, which would be coming sometime into PlayStation 3 in 2015.

1477
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:25,040
Also not to be left out, Xbox, the games with gold, are going to be getting two games

1478
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,280
for the month of March, starting off with Civ Revolution.

1479
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,040
So that's going to be pretty cool, and Dungeon Defenders, which is the Xbox Live Arcade game.

1480
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,040
Civilization Revolution is going to be free through March 16th, and of course, Dungeon

1481
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,560
Defenders is going to be after that for the remainder of the month.

1482
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:48,280
So Rob, Civ Rev, is that a good one to start off with, because I actually haven't played

1483
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,640
any Civ games at all.

1484
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,520
I think Civ Rev is a great one to start out with.

1485
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,000
I know some people had its issues with it because of the way it translates to controller

1486
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,560
play, but to me, Civilization Revolution has a lot in common with the very, very first

1487
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,840
Civilization game, which is still one of my favorites.

1488
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,600
I think a dumbed down, using my quoting fingers, a dumbed down Civilization game is not necessarily

1489
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,960
a bad thing.

1490
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,020
It kind of gets you, you know, kind of into the series and what it's all about.

1491
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,400
And if you like it, then you can step up and play, you know, Civ 4, Civ 5, or one of the

1492
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,000
newer ones, which Civ 5 is still great.

1493
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,360
If you didn't grab it during that Sid Meier Humble Bundle, though, I don't know what to

1494
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,120
tell you, because that was your chance and you blew it, if you didn't get the Sid Meier

1495
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,120
Bundle.

1496
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,120
I did not.

1497
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,120
Well, you blew it.

1498
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,120
That's alright.

1499
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,120
It'll be on sale.

1500
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,960
The only one I wanted to play was Civ 5, out of the whole bunch.

1501
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,600
So I didn't really feel the need to spend more than $10 on it.

1502
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,720
I understand, I understand.

1503
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,160
And last but not least, you had another game getting Zombie DLC, but this one's a little

1504
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
strange.

1505
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,640
Warehouse and Logistics Simulator.

1506
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,940
It's a sim game.

1507
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,560
It's getting Zombie DLC.

1508
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,240
And that's just kind of silly.

1509
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,440
Wait, that's a real game.

1510
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,560
There's a game called Warehouse and Logistics Simulator?

1511
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,560
I've never heard of this.

1512
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
Yes, there is.

1513
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,960
These are some of the games that are more popular on Steam.

1514
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,480
You may not realize it, like Farming Sim and stuff like that, just because it's kind of

1515
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,480
strange.

1516
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,420
Or what about the Euro Truck Driver Simulator 2 or that crazy shit.

1517
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:16,500
And this is not the only game that I know that's in the Simulator series that's actually

1518
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
gotten Zombie DLC.

1519
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:20,180
If I remember correctly, I want to see one of the Train Sim games.

1520
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:27,020
Either it was a mod or DLC that did get Zombie DLC or something for it.

1521
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,020
It was kind of silly.

1522
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:33,500
But yeah, it has you driving through a warehouse in a forklift trying to escape zombies.

1523
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,380
I don't know, it's just strange.

1524
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:42,900
But I guess you mow down the undead, they say they can get bombs, mines, and other weapons

1525
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,140
to help you clear out the zombies.

1526
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,860
Hey, you gotta know your audience, or at least maybe that might get a few more people to

1527
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:54,100
try Warehouse and Logistics Simulator, which, that's gotta be a pretty niche audience right

1528
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,620
there.

1529
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:01,300
Over at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says Euro Truck 2 is great, Honk!

1530
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,300
Is that a...

1531
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,340
I'll have to check out the game at some point.

1532
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:07,940
And SSJ100Matt referring, I think, to the background noise, SSJ100Matt wants to know

1533
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,940
what's for dinner, and did you bring enough for the class, Loki?

1534
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,980
That was my wife cooking dinner, so I don't know.

1535
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:15,980
Alright, fair enough.

1536
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,500
Alright, I got some news for you guys, moving on.

1537
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,740
This was a little bit controversial last week, some talk about Metal Gear Solid V Ground

1538
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:28,380
Zeroes, which again, was supposed to be kind of like that, I don't want to call it like

1539
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,300
the starter chapter, but I guess that's really what it is, it was supposed to be a short

1540
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:36,620
kind of Metal Gear Solid game, very short Metal Gear Solid game, that was gonna kind

1541
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:40,500
of tide us over until Phantom Pain was released, and it was only supposed to be a couple hours.

1542
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:45,380
Well, they were gonna release the game for $40, however, the physical PlayStation 4 and

1543
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:51,060
Xbox One versions had their price cut this week, down to $30, and in a statement the

1544
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,780
company said they wanted to, quote, provide as many people as possible an opportunity

1545
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,040
to play the game.

1546
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,820
In other words, you guys weren't having that shit.

1547
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:07,220
It's really fascinating how the internet kind of turned the price of that game around, that's

1548
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:11,880
pretty awesome there, so, well, I mean, I don't know, I say it's awesome, but maybe,

1549
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,780
you know, if the game is to make a profit for Konami, maybe it's not so awesome, I don't

1550
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:16,780
know.

1551
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:21,780
But we'll see, a lot of people seem to be happy with the news nonetheless.

1552
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,860
The 3DS over at Nintendo is gonna be having a promotion that will allow you a free download

1553
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,420
of Pokemon X or Y.

1554
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:35,860
That's right, when you get a new Nintendo 3DS or 3DS XL or even a 2DS system, as well

1555
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:41,940
as one of six select games to a club Nintendo account, you get a free download code for

1556
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,700
Pokemon X or Y.

1557
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:48,140
This is only between March 1st and 31st, and the eligible games are Mario Kart 7, Super

1558
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,540
Mario 3D Land, Animal Crossing, if you want to experience Ed in your town, just like Dark

1559
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:53,540
Soccer did.

1560
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,740
I would not wish that on anyone.

1561
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,860
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Lego City Undercover, and Yoshi's New Island.

1562
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,380
If you get one of those six games and a new 3DS, you tie them to your club Nintendo account,

1563
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,820
Nintendo's gonna give you a download code for Pokemon X or Y, and you gotta use it by

1564
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,620
May 31st, 2014.

1565
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:15,980
I guess, who isn't a fan of free games, but my thought is, I thought everybody who wanted

1566
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:21,580
Pokemon X or Y, they fucking got their 3DS by now so they could experience this.

1567
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:27,300
I guess maybe there's some holdouts, and if you were one of the holdouts, congrats.

1568
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,260
Free game for you.

1569
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,480
So there you go, that promotion throughout March.

1570
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,380
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com,

1571
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,420
use the passphrase, turkey.

1572
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,420
And lastly, from me, new Tony Hawk game.

1573
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,860
When was the last time you heard about us talking about a new Tony Hawk game?

1574
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,860
It's been a little while.

1575
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,860
Isn't he like 50?

1576
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:54,100
Probably, hey, you're never too old to skate, I don't know, I gotta know.

1577
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,780
Well they just have the HD one came out.

1578
01:23:56,780 --> 01:24:00,540
Yeah, I thought there was like one not that long ago, but wasn't the beginning of the

1579
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:05,620
end when they put out that like $100 skateboard thing, because they thought since Guitar

1580
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,860
Hero worked and people bought that peripheral, people would buy the, yeah, it didn't quite

1581
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,860
work out for him.

1582
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:17,860
Well, Tony Hawk is returning, but get this, it's a mobile phone game, womp womp.

1583
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:21,820
Tony Hawk talking to Bloomberg said, we're working on a game for mobile devices this

1584
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,820
year.

1585
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,820
We've never gone exclusively in that direction, so I'm excited because with the amount of

1586
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,460
time people are spending on their phones and their tablets playing games, we've never had

1587
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,620
our own game in that space.

1588
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,740
I'm excited to provide one finally.

1589
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:37,460
Well, that ought to get all two of you who care about that, a Tony Hawk game on your

1590
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:38,460
mobile phone.

1591
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,580
Look, I'm not shading the Tony Hawk series.

1592
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,220
They were great games, but they're just, they're going to suck on a mobile phone.

1593
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,220
Let's just keep it real.

1594
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,660
It's going to suck.

1595
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:45,660
Sorry.

1596
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,100
Not in the fun kind of way.

1597
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,180
That's right.

1598
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,260
Well, how about some different gaming news?

1599
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,660
How about it?

1600
01:24:53,060 --> 01:25:00,020
Well, there's something coming out about a potential Minecraft movie done by the Lego

1601
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:08,140
movie producer, and I don't know how I feel about that, but Notch basically said that

1602
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,180
there was a talk going on about it.

1603
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:16,860
They're working with Warner Brothers about a potential Minecraft movie, so whatever.

1604
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:25,100
Also, Retro Studios is saying that the Wii U is a powerhouse and is confirming that they're

1605
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,940
developing a game for it, but they haven't really said what exactly, but they're able

1606
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:36,060
to use, they're learning new HD techniques like pixel shading and stuff and things and

1607
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,860
that they loved working with Donkey Kong.

1608
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,380
So maybe that will be cool.

1609
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:45,020
Now I want to say that the reason why you're on the fence with the whole Minecraft movie

1610
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:51,620
thing is because you probably haven't gone to see the Lego movie yet, which is a travesty.

1611
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,620
At some point I'll get out.

1612
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,620
I kind of don't care about the Lego movie.

1613
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:56,020
Weren't we supposed to have a friend date?

1614
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:00,020
We were, and it just didn't happen because, you know, move and busyness and stuff.

1615
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,020
Aww, hi kitty.

1616
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,020
Sorry.

1617
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,020
Simbio came out.

1618
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,020
You got distracted by cats?

1619
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,020
Kitty.

1620
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,020
Fair enough.

1621
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,620
I just heard meh, meh, meh, meh.

1622
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:17,180
And then the Konami code works in Bravely Default.

1623
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:23,500
It's basically supposed to work once you've completed the game, but there's a clip about

1624
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,780
what happens.

1625
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:30,220
It's online somewhere, so that's kind of cool.

1626
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,900
And for those who don't know, I'm not going to tell you because you should fucking know

1627
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:33,900
this.

1628
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:34,900
I'm kidding.

1629
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,780
It's up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

1630
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,780
On the main menu.

1631
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:38,780
No, you should know that.

1632
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,780
Don't tell them that.

1633
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,420
Unless you're playing Parodius, then you do it backwards.

1634
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,420
Okay.

1635
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,320
Or if you're playing, which one was it where you had to use the L, R on top of the Super

1636
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,020
Nintendo controller, it blew up your ship?

1637
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,020
Was that Gradius III maybe?

1638
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,020
Maybe Gradius III?

1639
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,020
Yeah.

1640
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,020
Yeah, something like that.

1641
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,020
Alright.

1642
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:59,740
Well, if that's it for our rapid fire news, then we shall take a trip over to Facebook

1643
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:08,180
and Google Plus, so when you slam those words together, you get FUGL.

1644
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,620
It's the FUGL question of the week, everybody.

1645
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:17,700
We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we get answers, your

1646
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:23,420
answers over on those various sites, and we're going to start off tonight with some of the

1647
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:28,400
answers from Google Plus to our question, and I got to say, things got a little weird

1648
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:38,420
on Google Plus this week, and I'm seeing people answer who I never see answer, and some of

1649
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:43,220
it was getting a little heated, which I'm kind of not okay with, so just remember, everybody,

1650
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:47,220
treat each other with respect over on Google Plus, and now for some reason I can't get

1651
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,220
the post to come up.

1652
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,220
That's not good.

1653
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,220
That's a little embarrassing when we're doing live radio.

1654
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,220
Where is it?

1655
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,220
There it is.

1656
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,220
Phew.

1657
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:58,820
Yeah, see, just to put it out there, we have 16 responses on Google Plus, and I think that's

1658
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,500
more than we have on Facebook.

1659
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,760
That's not normal.

1660
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,760
Something happened there.

1661
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,760
This is not expected behavior.

1662
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,220
This is not expected behavior.

1663
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,860
I don't know what's up with that, but regardless, strangers were jumping in there telling each

1664
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,500
other that opinions were wrong and stuff, and I'm not okay with that.

1665
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,460
This is where every gamer has a voice.

1666
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,020
Let them be heard.

1667
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,900
Act Def starts us off with a haiku.

1668
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:23,220
Well, I'll read his full response since he took the time to give a haiku as well.

1669
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,220
Oh, I didn't even read the damn question.

1670
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,220
Sorry, guys.

1671
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:30,980
How do you feel about the news that Nintendo is pulling online support for DS and Wii games

1672
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,100
in a couple months?

1673
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,220
Will you misplay Mario Kart Wii online, or do you think it's best that these servers

1674
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,940
come down to make way for the future?

1675
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,900
An Act Def over on Google Plus said, well, with these games getting old, it was so little

1676
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,940
people playing them, it was only a matter of time for the servers to be shut down, specifically

1677
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:48,500
since Nintendo probably wants to save money rather than lose it right now.

1678
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,300
It's sad, but I think it's time to move on, people, and here's the haiku.

1679
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,700
Servers are shut down.

1680
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,060
New games are coming soon now.

1681
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,500
Nintendo needs cash.

1682
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,660
Jake F. replied on Google Plus, and he's a little mad about this situation.

1683
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,660
He's upset.

1684
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,660
Sounds a little upset.

1685
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,460
Jake says, I have no purpose for playing Smash Brothers now.

1686
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,460
Thanks a ton, Nintendo.

1687
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,780
Nintendo, I support you.

1688
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,300
I swim against the current for you.

1689
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,060
I get made fun of because of you.

1690
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,820
I'm among the few to fend you in front of the masses of PlayStation and Microsoft fanboys,

1691
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,540
and this is what I get?

1692
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:21,180
Guess it really is time for a PlayStation 3.

1693
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:28,020
Okay, overdramatization added by me, but it is Oscar night, everybody, for your consideration.

1694
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,900
Did you never learn to read?

1695
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,500
I'm thinking Jake was playing Smash Bros.

1696
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,940
We ask, who's still playing online?

1697
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,860
Well, Jake is apparently playing Smash Bros. online.

1698
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,900
He's a little heated, so there you go.

1699
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,540
He might jump ship over to PlayStation 3.

1700
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:45,700
Redertainment says, online foreign to Big N.

1701
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,740
I don't care about Big N's shut down plans.

1702
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,060
Yet another haiku answer.

1703
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,860
I'm loving this, you guys, loving it.

1704
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,940
Let's see, some other answers here.

1705
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:59,940
Matt D. replied and said, it stinks, but they need the server space for their other newer

1706
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:00,940
games.

1707
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:06,340
Maintaining the old ones along with the new ones would cost a ton of money.

1708
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:11,700
Zordrac Shadowfang, and I'm sure that's his real name, said, it's the price of online

1709
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,540
servers to handle multiplayer.

1710
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,340
Eventually, they get shut down.

1711
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:20,940
At least these games otherwise still work offline in both single player and local multiplayer.

1712
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:25,380
And lastly, AJ Twist replies and said, eh, it's more proof than Nintendo doesn't understand

1713
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,380
online.

1714
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,220
But maybe something good will come of this?

1715
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,220
We'll see.

1716
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,340
There's some of the answers over from Google Plus.

1717
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:35,380
I was not going to read answers from people that were like, you know, thank you for your

1718
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,980
insightful commentary and just kind of weird stuff.

1719
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,500
So I wonder how that happened.

1720
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:44,580
Is that because Google Plus like automatically tags things so it went out to a more public

1721
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,580
audience?

1722
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,580
I don't even know.

1723
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,580
Whatevers.

1724
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:52,780
Moving on to some of our answers over on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1725
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,780
We had quite a few answers.

1726
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:57,700
I'm only going to read a handful of these, so I apologize in advance, but I encourage

1727
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:01,340
you to check out all the answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1728
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:06,020
Monty Boggs says, I won't miss them, but it does seem like convenient timing considering

1729
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:09,000
Mario Kart 8 comes out a week or so after that.

1730
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,560
Something we had brought up on the show earlier.

1731
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,800
Our friend Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network says, the fact that Nintendo is ending their

1732
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,260
online services for Wii and DS isn't surprising.

1733
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:24,160
Most games and services tend to sever servers after some years, especially when the newest

1734
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,580
iteration releases.

1735
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,460
What is surprising is the sudden urgency that's being done.

1736
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:33,420
On May 20th, the 3DS will have been out for three years and the Wii U only a year and

1737
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,420
a half.

1738
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:38,060
I know that seems like a decent grace period, but if the sales numbers are correct, I doubt

1739
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:43,820
the Wii's 101 million owners have all upgraded, given the Wii U's almost 6 million sold.

1740
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:47,040
I'm not saying they should keep the Wii servers on forever, but I think they should keep them

1741
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,300
up a little bit longer, at least until the chasm-like gap has closed up a bit more.

1742
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,780
But you know what's interesting about it, I mean it's not that I disagree with what

1743
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:57,900
we could say in here, but, and it's kind of a question we ask ourselves in general,

1744
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:02,660
are these gaming companies under any liability to keep these servers up a certain time?

1745
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:03,660
They're really not.

1746
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,660
I don't think so.

1747
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:05,660
We're at their mercy.

1748
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,340
Which, as a consumer, kind of sucks.

1749
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,140
That isn't unexpected.

1750
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:16,020
It's not, but I mean at what point do we say, god damn it, this is what I paid for and it

1751
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,560
ought to work.

1752
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,420
This is what I paid for eight years ago, and it ought to work.

1753
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,420
No?

1754
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,420
No.

1755
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,720
This mixing board we bought eight years ago, and if it broke tomorrow, I'm not just going

1756
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,540
to be like, oh well, you know, well Radio Shack took it offline.

1757
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:34,140
Well we didn't get it at Radio Shack, we ordered it from the manufacturer.

1758
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,140
You know what I mean!

1759
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,140
Yeah, I know.

1760
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,140
Anyway.

1761
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:44,760
Uh, let's see, and uh, let's see, our power in A says, this move was inevitable, I think,

1762
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,880
and telling of what's to come for Nintendo.

1763
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,660
Dropping the Wi-Fi connection for the DS and Wii really is the sign that Nintendo is moving

1764
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:55,140
forward and will soon discontinue manufacturing and support for those two systems.

1765
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,140
Who knows?

1766
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:59,500
Maybe this means Nintendo is at least thinking of their next console system?

1767
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,260
Well, Rene, they're definitely thinking about it.

1768
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,020
They plan that stuff years and years in advance.

1769
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,800
There's probably already early prototypes.

1770
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,900
That's how long these things take to develop, honestly.

1771
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,060
We had those rumors a couple weeks ago, for better or for worse, about the more homogenized

1772
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:19,860
Nintendo experience, but again, it's weird to me that they're dropping DS when they're

1773
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,420
just gonna bring it out again over on the virtual consoles.

1774
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,420
Little weird.

1775
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:24,420
Little weird.

1776
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:29,100
Uh, lastly, Giove Dea says, it's not expected, and as long as I can still play the DLC content

1777
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:33,660
without Wi-Fi, I'm okay, mainly because I haven't used it, even with owning the games.

1778
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,900
At least with the DS, there's still the option of local play, right?

1779
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:40,780
Yep, that is true, and that's gonna have to suffice for those of you guys that decide

1780
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,860
to spend the money on the games.

1781
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:46,100
Alright, that's gonna do it for now for the FUCL Question of the Week.

1782
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,500
And please read all the responses, because they're really good, over at Facebook.com

1783
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,620
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1784
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:54,460
Let's get back into some gaming news with Loki.

1785
01:33:54,460 --> 01:34:01,580
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, eh, Zynga.

1786
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:08,940
They had a lawsuit, or I guess, a fraud lawsuit, which unfortunately was dismissed, and because

1787
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:15,340
of this, now the plaintiffs plan to change their complaint.

1788
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:23,060
Basically, the original complaint, which was 110 pages long, failed to offer relevant basic

1789
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:31,580
factual details, which I'd say is kind of an important part of any sort of lawsuit.

1790
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:38,540
They're also saying that because of that, they're going to, I guess, resubmit with some

1791
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,700
further evidence and that kind of stuff.

1792
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:46,340
My thing this has to do with, I want to say, they were talking about maybe their initial

1793
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:49,660
stock offering and stuff like that.

1794
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:54,740
Don't know if it's necessarily, you know, nothing to do with, of course, their cloning

1795
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:59,780
of games or anything like that, but maybe some insider trading.

1796
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,780
I don't know.

1797
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:06,660
Sounds all very complicated, if I don't like Zynga.

1798
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,660
It is a little bit.

1799
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:12,980
Well, I think the IPO fraud thing is, basically, long story short, they said the company was

1800
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:15,060
worth more than it really was.

1801
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,980
And again, that kind of goes back to the whole flash in the pan thing, is that Zynga was

1802
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:23,620
riding a huge high when they went for the IPO and the bubble burst, and maybe some people

1803
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:26,420
believe that they kind of should have seen that coming.

1804
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:28,540
Well, look at it this way.

1805
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:36,060
They're trying to do, it's almost like King is following Zynga's game plan almost.

1806
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:42,140
They had a flash in the pan game come out, and now they have all these games with Saga

1807
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,300
at the end.

1808
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:47,780
They're kind of using Saga as almost their vill, if you will.

1809
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:53,860
And that's the thing with any of these companies, especially nowadays, that yeah, at one time

1810
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:58,740
it may be worth X amount of dollars, but it doesn't mean that these games are making that

1811
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:01,300
kind of money indefinitely.

1812
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:05,980
It's just, people eventually move on to the next big thing.

1813
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:10,020
Or even the next just popular thing.

1814
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:13,300
We experience a very fickle market.

1815
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,380
Indeed.

1816
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,060
It's very casual, no one's really dedicated.

1817
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:24,460
Alright, well, speaking of it being a fickle market, this was very surprising.

1818
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:28,060
Some layoffs occurring at Sony Santa Monica.

1819
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:32,300
These are the guys that develop God of War, and obviously there's going to be another

1820
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,780
God of War game in the pipeline.

1821
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,780
That's not a surprise.

1822
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:38,180
So it's a little weird to me, especially when PlayStation is kind of riding a high right

1823
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,060
now, that there are layoffs at the studio.

1824
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:44,100
And I want to say, didn't they just have some PR layoffs and things like that a while ago?

1825
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:48,740
So this is really weird that this struggle is happening, I guess, at Sony Santa Monica.

1826
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:54,420
But yes, Sony did put out a statement, a nice little PC statement that said, Sony Computer

1827
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:58,500
Entertainment America can confirm that we have completed a reduction in workforce at

1828
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Santa Monica Studio.

1829
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,860
This is the result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas

1830
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,560
within SCEWWS.

1831
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,380
We do not take these decisions lightly, however, sometimes it is necessary to make changes

1832
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:14,180
to better serve the future projects of the studio.

1833
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:17,960
We have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease transition for

1834
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,220
those impacted.

1835
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:23,740
So I get the sense from this, and the rumors are definitely out there, that Sony was working

1836
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:25,820
on something that got canceled.

1837
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,640
And this is a result of that.

1838
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:32,540
And if you want to further believe rumors, again, huge salt lick of salt.

1839
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:37,140
But some rumors that are out there is that it was a project that was very similar to

1840
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:43,340
Destiny and didn't look like it was going to compete well with it, I guess, at the end

1841
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,340
of the day.

1842
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,300
I don't really know how else to easily put that.

1843
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:50,820
But again, rumor, huge rumor, take it with a grain of salt.

1844
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:56,220
But regardless, it is really odd to see such a big studio that produces titles like God

1845
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,780
of War going through these reductions.

1846
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:03,260
And even more so when you consider it's coming a week after we just heard about a similar

1847
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:07,160
thing from a studio we didn't expect, Irrational Games, right?

1848
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,740
So this begs the question, what the hell is going on?

1849
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,780
Loki, any thoughts?

1850
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,980
What the hell is going on?

1851
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,260
I don't know.

1852
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:19,460
Well, Irrational, we know what the situation was, is that they just wanted to go a different

1853
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,460
direction.

1854
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:26,100
Sony, Santa Monica, maybe they just have a, I don't know, there's downsizing, maybe they

1855
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:32,140
have another team that's going to be working on God of War, I don't really know.

1856
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:37,500
Well, still sad to hear, and I doubt we have anybody who worked for them that was impacted

1857
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:42,540
listening to the show, but just in case we do, and this goes for Irrational or any studio

1858
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,140
that we report in, our thoughts are with you guys.

1859
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:49,380
And it does sound like a lot of people were after those guys at Irrational, so it seems

1860
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,960
like there are jobs available somewhere, I just hope you can find them in a place that

1861
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,060
works for you and your family, and best of luck.

1862
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,260
Sorry to hear about that, it's no fun.

1863
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:59,460
That's poopy.

1864
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,180
So what if the game was similar to Destiny, you know what, we've had similar games coexist

1865
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:06,460
for a long time and it works out.

1866
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:10,300
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1867
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:16,720
Well there's some other news that, it could be bad news for some people, it could be decent

1868
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:22,480
news for others, but you know how we were talking about how there was the regulation

1869
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:27,960
going about those multiple little transactions that happen in games?

1870
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,600
Now there are meetings going on with representatives from the UK, France, Belgium, Denmark, and

1871
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:40,800
other EU members to go about creating rules for about apps that ask for how much and when

1872
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,520
these apps can ask for payment information.

1873
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:52,120
They've also got representatives from multiple different developers including Nintendo, Electronic

1874
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:58,800
Arts, Google, a few others, basically trying to make sure that these games are not misleading

1875
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,000
or exploit the market.

1876
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,400
So we'll see how that goes.

1877
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,280
I wonder if we would ever have anything like that here.

1878
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:16,120
But it's basically going to be a, you know, this is coming right after the UK group, which

1879
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:23,000
is the Office of Fair Trading, was basically saying, you know, hey, get it in order or

1880
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,560
we're going to enforce it.

1881
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,200
So don't know how it's going to happen.

1882
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,780
We'll see, won't we?

1883
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:32,780
We will.

1884
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,920
Or they will, I don't know.

1885
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,680
And of course, if they have to change something for Europe, it's going to impact everybody

1886
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,680
else.

1887
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,400
Well, not necessarily, but it probably will.

1888
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,400
We'll see.

1889
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:49,440
We might actually see them proactively working in the U.S. market to, you know, let's get

1890
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,200
it done now before we get it forced on us.

1891
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,460
All right, moving on, Loki.

1892
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:02,280
So South Park, the Stick of Truth, unfortunately was censored in certain countries.

1893
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:07,800
They basically said that there's five versions of the game, one for North America, South

1894
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:12,040
America, Europe, Germany, Australia, and Russia.

1895
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:16,160
The North America, South America one is completely uncensored on every platform, the Australia

1896
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:21,640
one is censored on all platforms, or the Australia one is censored on all platforms, European

1897
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:26,880
one and Russian ones are censored on console only, and the German one is censored on the

1898
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,360
console for anal probing, et cetera.

1899
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:36,720
And so, but the way they got about it is kind of, if you remember the South Park episodes

1900
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:41,480
where they were showing, supposed to be showing the image of Mohammed, and it was just kind

1901
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:47,520
of like, you know, this thing with a text box saying, you know, we would have shown

1902
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:54,480
an image of Mohammed, but oh, well, so they have a, they have this image that pops up

1903
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,480
as well.

1904
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:59,920
You lose again Europe, this scene where you try to disable the force field around Randy,

1905
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:03,680
but instead accidentally force the probing machine next to him to probe his ass with

1906
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,760
a violent force is not meant for your eyes.

1907
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,920
Randy, in obvious rectal pain, urges you to proceed onward.

1908
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,920
Wow.

1909
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:17,720
So they explain all this stuff in there, but yeah, I mean, unfortunately it's just stuff

1910
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:24,320
that they have to do to get around, you know, certain laws for decency and stuff, but yeah,

1911
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:30,200
I mean, if it's that much of a bother for you, and you do live in those countries, remember

1912
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:35,520
the PlayStation 3 is region free, so import away.

1913
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,720
Ooh, that's a good thought, that you could just, if you want to get around censorship,

1914
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,720
just import from another country.

1915
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,160
Do you think there would be a lot of people that actually do that, now that they know

1916
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,960
that that's out there?

1917
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,960
Probably not.

1918
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,880
Interesting.

1919
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,440
I know if it was my country, I would, but then again, importing games can be expensive.

1920
01:42:55,440 --> 01:43:00,440
All right, moving on, we were talking about free-to-play games a minute ago, and one of

1921
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:04,040
my favorites that came along last year, which a lot of people were talking about, is Path

1922
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,040
of Exile.

1923
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:10,480
Path of Exile is a Diablo-esque style game that came out from Grinding Gear Games, and

1924
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,200
apparently it's been doing very well for itself.

1925
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:17,840
They've held very strong to the standard that they're going to do ethical free-to-play,

1926
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:24,240
meaning that they don't sell experience boosts, they don't sell weapon upgrades, they sell

1927
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:30,560
like flashy things, like pets and cosmetic stuff only, and apparently it's been working

1928
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,560
out for them.

1929
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,840
This developer who is based in New Zealand, they have over 5 million registered players,

1930
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,400
hundreds of thousands playing at any given time, and they just announced this week an

1931
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:44,280
expansion, the Sacrifice of Vaal, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, V-A-A-L, Vaal, is

1932
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,600
coming out next week, free!

1933
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:53,200
PVP content, a new race of dark magic wielders, and you can charge up super-powered weapons

1934
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:58,520
by killing monsters, but no change to the monetization property, excuse me, no change

1935
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:03,200
to the monetization policy, and lead designer Chris Wilson says we don't want to compromise

1936
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,720
the game, we want to make a really good game that people love to play.

1937
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:11,380
So it seems like it's working out for them.

1938
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:16,440
They do kind of mention that we could make more money if we were to do more of the pay-to-win

1939
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:23,080
model, but people apparently are into the cosmetic stuff, they like to show off, and

1940
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:26,760
it's because people view this as a bit of a hobby.

1941
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:33,280
And they, in the Path of Exile store, they sell a big blue scorpion for $110, and they've

1942
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,200
actually sold a few hundred of those.

1943
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,800
You got the money, hey.

1944
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,080
Yeah, if you got the money and you want to support the game enough, I mean, in a way,

1945
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:45,080
it's kind of like, you know, people give thousands of dollars to these Kickstarter projects for

1946
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:49,000
games, I think, just for an opportunity to be involved and so forth, so if people have

1947
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,160
that type of money to give to something they really believe in.

1948
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,520
How many of us bought charity pets for a while?

1949
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,240
Yeah, well, because that was charity.

1950
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:02,160
Well, yeah, but still, I mean, it's the investing money into something you would support, right?

1951
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,160
Right.

1952
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:06,760
There's people who buy the pets for a while just because, hey pet, not just the charity

1953
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:07,760
pets.

1954
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,680
And to be fair, I mean, $110, I mean, that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, don't

1955
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,480
get me wrong, but it's also, what, two copies of a new video game?

1956
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:21,480
That's the price of two regular video games, and Path of Exile is a game that some people

1957
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:24,800
are getting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours out of, so is that really

1958
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,860
that much money?

1959
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:26,860
Maybe not.

1960
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:31,440
A game like World of Warcraft, I mean, over a year's time for a $12 subscription fee,

1961
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:38,320
shit, you've paid $144, so is $110 scorpion really that crazy?

1962
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,320
Maybe not.

1963
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:45,760
Anyway, so yeah, if you're into Path of Exile, check that out for the new expansion that's

1964
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:46,760
coming out this week.

1965
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,040
I know I will be checking that out, too.

1966
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:51,320
I hope the game doesn't crush under that, all those people wanting to check it out.

1967
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,320
We'll see.

1968
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,000
All right, Loki, you've got one more story for us before we get to the mailbag.

1969
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:05,400
Yeah, real quick, Apple TV, we've been saying, hey, you know, if Apple adds games to Apple

1970
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,520
TV, that could be a killer device.

1971
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,920
Well, another one of these rumors coming out saying, you know, reliable industry sources

1972
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:19,400
say that Apple TV will be getting game support in an update likely to come in March or earlier.

1973
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:24,600
Well, I'm going to say at this point it's going to be March because, you know, we're

1974
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:25,600
in March.

1975
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:32,280
But they're saying that apparently developers are working on Bluetooth controller options

1976
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:38,120
and, you know, they're saying that could, you know, work directly with Apple TV rather

1977
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:43,020
than relying on another iOS device as an intermediary.

1978
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,480
And basically saying that, you know, game support could be backwards compatible with

1979
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:52,440
current generation Apple TV, although, you know, they would expect that, you know, you

1980
01:46:52,440 --> 01:47:00,760
would want maybe iCloud support because the Apple TVs don't really have much storage space.

1981
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,720
It'd be interesting if they did that.

1982
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,720
I don't know.

1983
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,480
I thought the Apple TVs weren't that powerful.

1984
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,600
So maybe if they release a new version.

1985
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:14,040
Well, but they've got to be about as powerful as Sanuya, let's be real, right?

1986
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,960
That's true, but I would think that maybe they're going to maybe release a new version

1987
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,720
or something because, you know, if you want to show off like, you know, HD gaming or something

1988
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:26,200
like that, I would think that maybe like a new version of Apple TV or something for maybe

1989
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,340
200 bucks would be interesting.

1990
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:32,480
It does seem about that time of year where Tim Cook ought to get up on the stage and

1991
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,220
talk about what's happening over at Apple.

1992
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:38,940
I know, you know, because we usually have the iPhone thing and that's later in the year

1993
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:42,140
or God, then they started kind of flipping the script and it was earlier in the year

1994
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:45,060
for a little bit, but iPads were usually early in the year.

1995
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:48,340
Like I do feel like, hmm, it's been a good four or five months since we've had a big

1996
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:52,940
Apple pump and circumstance, you know, and Apple TV would be a thing that you'd think

1997
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:53,940
they would update.

1998
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,660
Although, I would be very curious, like, what else is Apple working on?

1999
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:03,020
There's been buzz for a very long time, you know, because it seems, correct me if I'm

2000
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:08,020
wrong, but it seems like ever since Tim Cook took over, we haven't really seen new per

2001
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,020
se.

2002
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:14,220
I mean, we've seen improvements to existing things like iPhone and iPad and so forth,

2003
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,340
but there's been rumblings forever now that, oh, Apple's going to get into television and

2004
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,180
Apple's going to get into this or that.

2005
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,220
And we haven't seen that yet.

2006
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:25,820
And I think a lot of us are really waiting for like, what's Apple's next card to play?

2007
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:31,660
Well, I think, yeah, they're trying to get into new spaces, basically, instead of, you

2008
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:34,900
know, trying to put out something else.

2009
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:40,620
I would be very skeptical that they would put out a TV, just because TV technology is

2010
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:45,380
changing so much and, you know, the price point of a TV that was, you know, would have

2011
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:47,020
some sort of Apple integration on it.

2012
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:50,460
I just, I would think that they would go like the Apple TV route because it would be cheaper

2013
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:53,260
and just, you know, plug that into a normal, you know, TV.

2014
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:59,100
Why would you want, you know, the super high-res TV that I guess you would only get content

2015
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,540
from Apple with for it.

2016
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,260
But I don't think they would go that route.

2017
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:08,580
But like, I know one of the things that people have been saying for a while now is, you know,

2018
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:14,020
a watch that they have, you know, their wonderful, you know, office with the curved glass windows

2019
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:20,380
and stuff that maybe they're going to, hey, that's Josh's lunch.

2020
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:22,180
Somebody's watch is going off right now.

2021
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,180
Yeah.

2022
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:27,100
You know, they have that office with the curved glass and everything that they're supposed

2023
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:32,100
to be using some sort of like curved glass technology or curved display for like a watch

2024
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,820
type thing.

2025
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:36,420
So I wonder if that's, you know, a possibility.

2026
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,620
That's like straight up Dick Tracy right there.

2027
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:40,420
Remember, God, I'm probably dating myself.

2028
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,420
Remember like Dick Tracy?

2029
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,780
I mean, the originals were like from the 1930s.

2030
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,400
I'm not that old y'all, but I know they had a resurgence in the 90s and that movie came

2031
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:51,000
out with Warren Beatty and he used to have like the little like TV on a watch where he

2032
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,880
would talk to people and like, I could fucking see Apple doing that, like FaceTime on the

2033
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:55,880
fucking watch.

2034
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,760
Like it would be here for real.

2035
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,760
But I don't know.

2036
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,760
For me, I don't like watches.

2037
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,760
I don't know.

2038
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,440
I used to wear them as a kid, but I don't really wear them anymore.

2039
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,440
I just don't know.

2040
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,040
Like maybe they would do that as your phone or something because I mean, everyone really

2041
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,340
has like, most people have a smartphone now.

2042
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:16,440
So it would be just kind of weird to have like, oh, this is just an iPod, you know,

2043
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,480
but it's a watch.

2044
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,480
I don't know.

2045
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,480
Watches are the domain of hipsters now.

2046
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,480
Well.

2047
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,480
It's a dangerous combination.

2048
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:24,480
All right.

2049
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,480
Well, we'll see.

2050
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,880
I feel like we've heard this rumor out of Apple before, but we'll see, you know, sometimes

2051
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:34,680
where there's smoke, there's fire, but it could just be a big poot too.

2052
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:39,520
We'll see what happens next time Tim Cook takes the stage.

2053
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:45,200
If they plan something around E3, watch yourself, but otherwise probably no big deal.

2054
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,640
Didn't they actually do a press conference during E3 one time?

2055
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:51,760
I seem to remember like, like not at E3, just coincidentally, it was like the same time.

2056
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,680
Like I seem to remember Apple was doing a huge press conference, like the exact same

2057
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,160
time as somebody else.

2058
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,080
Anyway, random tangent.

2059
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:04,580
Speaking of random tangents, why don't we open up our brand new email bag over at participate

2060
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:09,920
at orange lounge radio.com where you guys email us every week, your thoughts, your comments,

2061
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,040
your questions here on the show.

2062
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:21,120
And most thankfully this week over in the new email address, no spam, glorious, glorious.

2063
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,120
So sorry to those.

2064
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,520
You guys are still trying to use the old email address, but we had to take drastic measures.

2065
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:30,000
So again, if you want to email the show, participate at orange on traded.com is the place to do

2066
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
so.

2067
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Let's get to it.

2068
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Dark soccer.

2069
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,240
Who has the honor of being our very first email or in the new mail bag?

2070
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,240
That would be AZHP.

2071
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:39,680
Hey, all our crew is HP here.

2072
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:44,120
Rob was wondering last week while people are so interested in Twitch plays Pokemon and

2073
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:48,480
also be among the fact that there were so many knockoffs, I'd like to give an explanation

2074
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:53,800
for the first question and explanation for why other games don't work.

2075
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,440
First I think the reason that people are interested in Twitch plays Pokemon is because the community

2076
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:02,400
is creating a narrative for all the things good and bad that happen when a normal person

2077
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,400
plays Pokemon.

2078
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,200
There isn't much dramatic tension.

2079
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,200
You're going to level up.

2080
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,200
You're going to fight.

2081
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,200
You're going to use your best attacks.

2082
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,200
And if you don't win, you'll level up some more.

2083
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:17,200
With TPP, every time you fight a gym leader, you don't know if Pidgeot is going to use

2084
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:21,280
sand attack seven times in a row or if Lapras will sing repeatedly before killing the enemy

2085
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,280
in one attack.

2086
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:28,280
When you're trying to catch Zapdos, you don't worry about whether or not you're going to

2087
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:32,240
accidentally toss your master ball or use it on the Pokemon you weren't intending to

2088
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:36,280
catch or just straight up running away from Zapdos immediately after finding him.

2089
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,240
All these things are possibilities in TPP.

2090
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:44,200
Add to the fact that you can really feel like you're contributing by coming up with plans

2091
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:48,040
and rallying people behind them, you've got a recipe for a fairly interesting time.

2092
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:51,840
That's a good point.

2093
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,000
The people who have tried to start up different types of games with the same principle don't

2094
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,680
understand the reason why Twitch plays Pokemon is actually engaging to watch.

2095
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:04,960
There are several criteria a game must meet in order to be playable via chat with delay.

2096
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:11,680
Game must not be turn based with little to no timing involved.

2097
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,460
Game must not reset your progress when you die.

2098
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:19,120
Game must not have an option to exit to main menu or soft reset.

2099
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:22,120
You can see that there are very few games that don't meet criteria two, much less all

2100
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,240
three.

2101
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:27,840
For instance, Bioshock doesn't reset your progress when you die, but you can pause and

2102
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,880
quit the game and controlling Bioshock with a 30 second delay would be incredibly difficult.

2103
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:38,640
For those reasons, I can think of no other game besides Pokemon that is interesting when

2104
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,080
played via crowdsourcing.

2105
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,680
Additionally, there is such a deep love of Pokemon and there is so much variety to the

2106
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:49,560
strategies in Pokemon that nearly everyone can have an opinion on what should be done

2107
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,560
in the game.

2108
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,920
I hope I was able to shed some light on Twitch plays Pokemon.

2109
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,640
As of this writing, February 27th Thursday, Twitch is on the road to the Elite Four, but

2110
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,760
it seems like they're going to be stuck in Victory Road for a while due to the one way

2111
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,560
ledges and boulder puzzles which bar their way along with the high level random encounters

2112
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:07,560
and trainers.

2113
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,240
I wonder where they'll be when you guys read this email.

2114
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:13,200
Love Always, AZHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.

2115
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:18,800
Well, there you go and now you get the honor of being the first emailer to participate,

2116
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:26,280
but a lot of what you say makes sense and certainly the fact that Pokemon will not throw

2117
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:31,520
you all the way back to the beginning when you lose or whatever is a key component.

2118
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:37,480
But yeah, I still worry that this is the type of thing where it's like it's lightning

2119
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,480
in the bottle.

2120
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,600
It's a flash in the pan.

2121
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,600
Don't take that too offensively.

2122
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:46,320
I'm just saying that I kind of don't think this is going to have the longevity people

2123
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,680
think it does because there's going to be so many knockoffs and things like that.

2124
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:53,520
And you do outline what makes this work versus Mario Brothers and so forth.

2125
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,520
There's no denying that.

2126
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,560
But I would even suggest if you were to take other RPGs, which would be prime candidates

2127
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,600
based on the criteria you've outlined there, it's not going to work forever.

2128
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,720
And once you get too many of them, it's going to dilute a lot.

2129
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:09,880
Now what this does bring to the table, because I don't want to make this sound negative because

2130
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,560
it's not, because obviously people have noticed and developers have noticed and other gamers

2131
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,960
and the people who make games have noticed.

2132
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,160
And I think what you're going to see as a result of this is you're going to see more

2133
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:23,320
interactivity within games.

2134
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:27,600
We're already starting to see that a little bit as we got into last week with Tomb Raider

2135
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:32,960
and there's another new one out there that does this too, but that people will be able

2136
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,640
to interact with the Twitch streams in different ways.

2137
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:39,440
And I think that is the door that Twitch Plays Pokemon is opening.

2138
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:44,840
But I don't really see Twitch Plays Pokemon as something we're going to be talking about

2139
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,040
six months from now.

2140
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,440
Funny enough, I think it's coming up again later in the show because we want to give

2141
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,800
an update on where it's at.

2142
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,920
And don't get me wrong, fascinating experiment.

2143
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,920
Crazy how probably more people have watched Twitch Plays Pokemon than some second tier

2144
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,200
basic cable channel.

2145
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,880
Probably more people were watching Twitch Plays Pokemon than were watching G4.

2146
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:08,560
Let's be, you know, so that, let's not underestimate what has happened there, but it's all happened

2147
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:14,040
very quickly too at a count of two weeks and things like this tend to go as fast as they

2148
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,040
come.

2149
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,040
But if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

2150
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,040
Hey.

2151
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,800
I'm sorry, I've got a cough drop.

2152
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,800
That's okay.

2153
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,800
I got a glass of wine.

2154
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:22,800
Yeah, well I had some.

2155
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,800
Let's mix them.

2156
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,800
Just kidding.

2157
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:25,800
It's gross.

2158
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,600
I just specifically want to take a moment here and now to give thanks to you guys.

2159
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:33,320
Specifically I wanted to thank Rob Roberts, Gimmitt, Captain Spike, and Exifer for giving

2160
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,200
me advice and strength I didn't think I had.

2161
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,520
It is with their help that I was finally able to come out to my family and therefore the

2162
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,560
rest of the world.

2163
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:44,640
The support I've received from everyone is amazing despite all my fears and I've yet

2164
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:46,880
to encounter a single negative reaction to it.

2165
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,440
I feel closer to my family now than I've ever felt before with my mom, dad, brothers, and

2166
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:54,360
sister all sending me messages and calling me just to tell me how proud they are.

2167
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:58,080
I wish I hadn't been afraid to tell them in the first place.

2168
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:01,480
I could honestly say that the way I feel now is probably the happiest I've ever felt in

2169
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:02,880
my entire life.

2170
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:07,200
I needed this release and I have a word of advice to anyone who still isn't out.

2171
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:11,040
If you feel that your family and friends will accept you no matter what your sexuality is

2172
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,300
then just tell them.

2173
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:16,480
The support and love that you can get in return is just so worth it.

2174
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:20,000
Again, thank you so very much with love, Asfer.

2175
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,640
I don't know what to say.

2176
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:24,640
It's great.

2177
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:25,640
It's fantastic.

2178
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:28,440
I'm very, very happy to hear it.

2179
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:34,600
I'm happy to hear that you had that and that you had that, you know, welcomeness in your

2180
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:40,320
family and so forth and that everything went really good for you and congratulations on

2181
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,360
that big step.

2182
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:47,760
I know that has nothing to do with video gaming but I really don't give a shit because as

2183
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:53,240
long as we're going to continue to have talks about, you know, everything from why do we

2184
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:59,680
need a gay gamer convention, which I've talked to death about before on the show, to not

2185
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,960
to get too political here but I have to.

2186
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:03,480
This is my life we're talking about here.

2187
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:07,800
We have to talk about when people want to pass laws where people are going to be able

2188
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:12,640
to refuse you service just because of, you know, what you are.

2189
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:17,200
Like that shit is like obviously we're cockulous and thank God, you know, somebody came to

2190
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:20,220
our senses and said, you know, maybe this is a bad idea.

2191
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:25,220
Did you see the restaurants that were putting up signs that says we reserve the right to

2192
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:29,060
refuse service to Arizona legislators?

2193
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:30,060
Right?

2194
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,060
How does it feel?

2195
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,060
How does it feel?

2196
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:36,300
But there's also something that one of the things that really, really, really, really

2197
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:41,020
bothers me that some people have the perception of gays and lesbians and so forth is that

2198
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,460
it's a choice.

2199
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,980
Being a legislator is a choice.

2200
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:48,900
Being gay, not a choice.

2201
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:53,860
I am happy to tell you firsthand, I did not, I am a gay man and I did not wake up one day

2202
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,900
and go, you know what, I think I'll be gay.

2203
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:59,660
I think, I think from here on out, I'm going to be gay.

2204
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,860
It's not how it works people.

2205
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:05,700
And whoever's telling you is, doesn't know what they're talking about.

2206
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:08,260
Ask them when they decided to be straight.

2207
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:09,260
Right?

2208
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:13,800
Anyhow, I could go on a whole nother tangent here because there's been a lot of chatter

2209
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:19,160
this week about when are we ever going to have a AAA video game with a gay lead character

2210
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,240
and one big developer decided to come out and say, eh, probably never, to, to all this

2211
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,240
other stuff.

2212
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,560
And you know, the continued, whenever I see gamer X, there's a great story that's run

2213
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,640
on them.

2214
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:36,280
There's always that first comment, well, I'm going to have straight gamer con.

2215
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,280
You know what?

2216
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:40,220
Every time you say that, it's like, you sound exactly like the people who ask about white

2217
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:41,640
history month.

2218
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,880
It's, it's, it's, you know, it's, that's what it is.

2219
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:52,880
It's people not wanting their own ableist and march and marginalizing behavior brought

2220
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,880
out to the forefront.

2221
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:01,880
You know, when you get thrown in a trash can because you're straight, when you get threatened

2222
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:07,240
with violence because you're straight, when you get called straight because you're bad

2223
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:11,000
at a video game, we'll have a conversation.

2224
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:15,000
Until then, knock it off.

2225
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,760
Don't even get me started on the people who say, well, that's not a sexuality at all.

2226
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:20,760
You know?

2227
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,760
Yeah.

2228
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,560
I, people just need to stop putting labels on other people.

2229
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:30,240
I don't care who fucks who or who can't fuck anybody else or what people do with their

2230
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,780
bits as long as I don't have to know about it.

2231
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:34,780
I don't care.

2232
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,780
No one else should care.

2233
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:36,780
It's no one's business.

2234
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:39,880
At the end of the day, isn't love better than hate?

2235
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:42,840
At the end of the day, tacos are better.

2236
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:43,840
I do love tacos.

2237
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,840
Okay then.

2238
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:45,840
All right.

2239
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:50,360
Anyway, I didn't mean to just, just to, I went on a crazy ass tangent from Oscar's email.

2240
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,760
Congratulations my friend.

2241
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,320
This, this drinks for you.

2242
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:58,480
I already drink on mine or I would, okay.

2243
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:04,280
This comes from my good friend Catastrophic Monkey, who I chat with every so often.

2244
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:08,720
Not as much as I would like to since we were time zones apart and I have a job now.

2245
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:13,160
Farewell mailbag hello participation also and he gives me a link.

2246
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:16,160
I hope it gets a year of release and that the second one comes out too.

2247
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:23,180
This is Shin Megami Tensei coming to iOS and it's actually, you know, old school Atlas

2248
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:24,920
Joy.

2249
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:30,360
It's going to be out on the 18th set in Tokyo and you know what, I may just actually get

2250
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:35,440
this game because hey, Shin Megami Tensei and I've been meaning to play it so why not?

2251
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:42,000
It's going to be $7.99 and it'll be about 40 to 60 hours to beat so maybe I'll eventually

2252
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,080
finish it this year.

2253
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:48,880
Thank you Moggy for sending me the mail.

2254
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,240
Hey OLR or Hi OLR I should say.

2255
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,240
It's Raginator.

2256
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:55,600
I just have a question regarding PC gaming seeing as I'm still reasonably new to the

2257
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,360
PC gaming scene.

2258
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:02,080
I know that typically people would do their gaming on a desktop if only because with desktops

2259
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:05,720
you can upgrade the PC's innards to boost performance.

2260
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:10,760
However since I'm doing my gaming on a laptop that isn't a possibility as far as I know

2261
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:15,200
outside of upgrading the hard drive or RAM so my question is twofold.

2262
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:19,080
Is it possible to tweak a laptop settings to boost its performance even if the increase

2263
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:20,300
is only marginal?

2264
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,320
By the way yes.

2265
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:29,160
There are different graphical accelerators and if you've got an Nvidia capable type of

2266
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:35,680
card built in they actually do release an optimization thing for Nvidia.

2267
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,360
Actually AMD has one too.

2268
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:41,120
It's got Raptor built in which some people have kind of the mixed feelings on and I'm

2269
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:47,000
going to be honest I've gotten some better settings using different things but it will

2270
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,880
give you a good benchmark.

2271
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:52,520
Like I used it for Diablo 3 and Final Fantasy 14 and the games do run really well using

2272
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:58,160
the AMD because I have an AMD graphics card and it works well but you can always tweak

2273
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,560
it and get something a little better maybe.

2274
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:05,440
Just be careful if you're on a laptop because laptop cooling is crap.

2275
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,440
And I would say before you ever really push something to its limits like that please read

2276
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:18,880
up on it because it's not always, and I want to put this big disclaimer that if your computer

2277
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:24,000
sets on fire because you pushed your graphics card too much to limit your fault not ours.

2278
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,040
You're probably Loki.

2279
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,040
Yes you're probably Loki.

2280
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:32,560
It is probably me because hey I did everything to help that laptop stay cool and you know

2281
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,520
I had it a while though.

2282
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,320
You had it a while.

2283
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:44,360
Well it was used so it was old and it was infamous for overheating but I did like all

2284
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:50,960
sorts of cooling mods to it increasing the airflow in it, overclocking the fan, put new

2285
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:58,840
thermal paste on there but Titanfall was enough to kill it so I don't know it's just

2286
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:00,440
you got to be careful.

2287
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:04,200
The newer laptops you have better cooling but if you're really looking for like you

2288
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:09,160
know like customizing a laptop or something like that they actually do have places you

2289
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:12,600
can buy customized laptops.

2290
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:15,720
There's like websites that will actually do that.

2291
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:18,360
Very rare though especially for laptops.

2292
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,080
Did our emailer say if they were on a laptop or not?

2293
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,760
Well I haven't finished the email.

2294
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:23,760
Oh sorry.

2295
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:29,400
But he did by the way say it was Reaganator and the second question by the way was what

2296
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,320
are those changes which we've already started answering.

2297
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:39,800
As a side note this is what I have an Acer Aspire V5 571 Windows 7 home premium 64-bit

2298
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:47,600
4 gigabyte RAM and Intel Pentium CPU 967 at 1.3 gigahertz.

2299
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,320
Wow that's old.

2300
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:50,320
That is old.

2301
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:54,320
Yeah and I know we've chatted on the show before Reaganator and I know you have to game

2302
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:58,240
on a budget and so forth so I can't exactly just sit here and be all like well go get

2303
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,880
a new graphics card.

2304
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:04,840
I understand why you really want to push the limits of what you have but the reality is

2305
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:07,240
technology upgrades fast.

2306
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:12,880
That's why we you know our consoles upgrade that's why PCs are going up.

2307
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:17,280
If you want to stay on the cutting edge of technology you're going to have to I hate

2308
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:22,280
to say this try to squeeze in your already probably stressed budget a little bit.

2309
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:25,840
How you're going to maybe upgrade your video card to support as opposed to maybe stretching

2310
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:26,840
what you got.

2311
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:27,840
And that's in a laptop.

2312
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:28,840
That would be damn difficult.

2313
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:30,000
Yeah and a laptop that's going to be really hard.

2314
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,500
If you were working with a desktop I would say in a desktop now here's the good news

2315
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,300
you might be able to find something really good second hand like on eBay or something

2316
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,300
like that.

2317
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:42,040
I mean I know you're taking your chances and so forth but hear me out here you have a lot

2318
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:47,520
of people that are in a financial situation where they can buy the pick of the litter

2319
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:52,600
the new newest thing the hot new thing to play the hot new game and they're going to

2320
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:57,180
sell off their old cards which really aren't that old that maybe you can benefit from.

2321
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,200
That's something that might be more appealing to somebody that's that's working on a really

2322
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:05,080
extreme budget but pushing what you have.

2323
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:09,580
Do you really want to take that risk that you're going to overheat your system and really

2324
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:12,860
screw it up because then you're going to really be in a pickle.

2325
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:16,160
So I would say if you're at that point where you're saying should I overclock to squeeze

2326
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:20,140
out just a little more performance I'm going to I'm going to actually say no.

2327
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:21,140
Don't do it.

2328
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:25,460
And if you're looking for like a custom laptop look for was it a cleavo.

2329
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:31,920
It's this company they do custom laptops and I think they're in Europe but they may have

2330
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,860
them also in the U.S. as well.

2331
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:41,740
Yeah I think they actually do have one in the U.S. a pro star but those would be the

2332
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:43,740
ones that you can literally cut.

2333
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:48,580
They customize everything and so that's very unusual usually you know when you're like

2334
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:51,620
shopping like Dell or something like that you're going to be very limited to a certain

2335
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:56,800
skew and you know what you can upgrade and downgrade and that kind of stuff.

2336
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,140
Also everyone in chat seems to be telling you new egg.

2337
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:03,300
I have a better suggestion and that's if you have a fries take it to fries have them price

2338
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:05,700
match new egg and you save shipping.

2339
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:10,300
There's a little app I'm going to advertise an app right now it's called shop savvy.

2340
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:19,340
It will you scan the barcode of any any product and it will pull up online and in store retailers

2341
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:24,060
with all of their prices the URLs to the items so that you can take it up to anyone who price

2342
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:28,480
matches say this is the item have them search for it and go OK yeah we can give you that

2343
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,040
that deal.

2344
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:33,940
That's how I got when I bought my my mass fix for you remember.

2345
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:38,740
That's how I had a price match Amazon because I found it for 36 bucks brand new instead

2346
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,840
of you know 50 something dollars.

2347
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:44,300
And M.M.2K in our chat room brings up a good point that when you when you shop with new

2348
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:48,740
egg or fries which now some of our chatters are like oh yeah fries M.M.2K says a better

2349
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:53,100
chance is building an eBay quote unquote rig a lot cheaper and the risk is not that high.

2350
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:55,340
That's a that's a really good point.

2351
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:58,960
I can I can support that and the dungeon buster points out you know what Amazon also has a

2352
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,520
few good hardware deals from time to time surprisingly.

2353
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,380
So those comments from our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com again to the

2354
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:08,920
email or rage nator don't feel like I mean when you see the price of new cards you're

2355
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,180
going to be like two hundred dollars you know there's going to be some expensive stuff out

2356
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:16,400
there but don't feel like you have to go the tip of the iceberg.

2357
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:19,360
Go to the models that are a year a year and a half old you might be able to find something

2358
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:23,560
like 50 50 70 bucks who knows maybe even cheaper if you can really find somebody who's on loading

2359
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:26,440
a bunch of offloading a bunch of stuff and it's going to be better than what you have

2360
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:27,440
now.

2361
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:30,720
And you know what check check Craigslist anyway.

2362
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:34,920
You know I actually like I was a fool might be giving it away for free.

2363
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:40,000
You take chances but I was just you know randomly hunting in to see because I want a MacBook

2364
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,680
Pro and someone was selling like one from a year ago for five hundred fifty bucks.

2365
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:50,760
I mean it's already gone but you know it was like that's a good price.

2366
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:54,720
You know you know a lot of people clear them out for maybe nine hundred to a thousand.

2367
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:58,080
You know I'm just using that as an example but you can always find people selling off

2368
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,960
their old graphics cards.

2369
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,560
Well good luck to you buddy.

2370
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,560
Was that it for emails.

2371
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,840
Oh there's one more.

2372
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,840
One more.

2373
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:08,320
Wow you guys are filling up the mailbag this week at participate at orangesonsradio.com.

2374
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,320
Hello.

2375
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,320
Hi.

2376
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,160
With the implementation of the new email address I thought I'd ask about spam.

2377
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,160
Have you ever had spam.

2378
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,160
Do you like it.

2379
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,160
Do you cook with spam.

2380
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,560
Do you have any good recipes involving spam.

2381
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,040
Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam.

2382
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,080
Stay black for entertainment.

2383
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,440
This message was brought to you in part by money Python.

2384
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:26,760
And my answer to that.

2385
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:31,080
I don't like spam.

2386
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,080
I think Jamie put it best.

2387
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:37,080
Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam.

2388
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,080
All right.

2389
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,080
Anyhow.

2390
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:46,080
Participate at orangesonsradio.com but please keep the spam.

2391
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:47,080
Unless you're.

2392
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,840
It's like a theme song for our mailbox.

2393
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:54,160
Unless you're in Hawaii where it's like part of the culture then spam is okay.

2394
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,160
All right.

2395
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:57,840
That was a great.

2396
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,760
We should change the mail address every week.

2397
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,580
We get great email segments when we do that.

2398
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:06,600
Not that they're all bad but that was a particularly great segment this week.

2399
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,600
All right.

2400
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,600
Anyhow.

2401
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,600
Let's move on.

2402
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:10,600
It's the FUs of the week time.

2403
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:14,400
Oh now we're going to spam the airwaves with some angst.

2404
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:39,960
Get ready for it.

2405
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:48,360
FU to gaming sites taking secondhand knowledge from somebody that heard something else on

2406
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:51,680
some social media site.

2407
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:54,640
It's not a story.

2408
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,640
Well said.

2409
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:01,880
My FU of the week goes to the stress that comes with moving.

2410
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,280
Although I'm sure everything will be okay.

2411
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:09,200
It's just one of those like oh my god I have to put everything in a box.

2412
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,040
But it'll be worth it.

2413
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:12,520
It'll so be worth it.

2414
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,520
Can't wait.

2415
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:14,520
All right.

2416
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:15,520
There it is.

2417
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,720
The FUs of the week everybody.

2418
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,720
Moving on.

2419
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,720
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2420
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:23,520
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange

2421
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,520
lounge radio.

2422
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:25,520
But first Loki.

2423
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,520
Yeah.

2424
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:32,680
So as we were talking about a little bit before Twitch plays Pokemon has concluded.

2425
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:34,040
Pokemon Red.

2426
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:43,720
They after like I guess two weeks they finally defeated the end of the game there and now

2427
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:48,120
they've moved on to Pokemon Crystal.

2428
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:50,600
So it's not over.

2429
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:52,420
It still goes.

2430
02:11:52,420 --> 02:12:01,520
So is there like a helix fossil and crystal I mean because it's going to be sad that doesn't

2431
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,520
move along there.

2432
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,240
Yeah I don't remember that one at all.

2433
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:10,660
I watched a little bit of the feed today just to see like you know how they're doing and

2434
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:11,660
you know game over.

2435
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:15,880
It was no they were just they were running in and out of a house but now it's game over.

2436
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,880
No they're on crystal now.

2437
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:18,960
Oh I meant I thought you were talking about the other one.

2438
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:19,960
No no no no no.

2439
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,940
I saw all the victory screenshots and so forth.

2440
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:25,420
But my favorite thing to come out of this Twitch plays Pokemon thing honestly it's so

2441
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:29,280
funny that last week I was so ignorant to a lot of this stuff that we was bringing up

2442
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,540
but I read up on some of it.

2443
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:34,880
And I got to say like the fanfic and the culture that have come out of Twitch plays Pokemon

2444
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,720
is pretty hilarious.

2445
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,180
And if anything is going to keep it going it's going to be that.

2446
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:43,220
But like seriously there's like comics about bird Jesus.

2447
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:44,220
Thank you.

2448
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,220
You're right.

2449
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,620
It is kind of Tumblr's fault.

2450
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:54,700
My people Tumblr you guys are weird but I say that with love and Lord Helix and yes

2451
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:58,460
and what was that Evie is the false prophet or something like that like it was all this

2452
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,460
crazy shit.

2453
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,660
It's hilarious.

2454
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:06,180
Anyways so some of the stats coming out from that.

2455
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:10,580
It ran for 16 days 7 hours 45 minutes and 30 seconds.

2456
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:16,260
It at its max it had 121,000 people watching.

2457
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:21,940
There was over 122 million commands issued in chat.

2458
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:28,620
More than 9 million onlookers and 36 million views and they were saying total minutes watched

2459
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:31,780
more than 1 billion.

2460
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:32,780
That's ridiculous.

2461
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,780
Oh my gosh.

2462
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:34,780
Hey.

2463
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:35,780
Great.

2464
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:36,780
Great for them though.

2465
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:41,440
That's Twitch TV's just sitting there counting the cash from all the ads and the subscriptions

2466
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:46,580
on that although then again that's a bandwidth bill I'm not sure I'd want to have to pay

2467
02:13:46,580 --> 02:13:47,580
for.

2468
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:52,220
They should do that with like a TV show or something where they pick the outcome that

2469
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:53,220
way.

2470
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:57,100
Well somebody in chat earlier and I apologize I don't know who said this but I just remember

2471
02:13:57,100 --> 02:14:02,460
reading the comments somebody had said I wish I would watch the Twitch plays Pokemon

2472
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:07,100
channel on TV before I'd watch G4 again something to that effect and I was like kind

2473
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,740
of surprised somebody doesn't try to make like a TV show or something out of this but

2474
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:17,900
I mean we live in this age where the internet is making us rethink TV.

2475
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:21,260
It is Twitch plays Pokemon is a TV show.

2476
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:29,140
It's just not on what you used to think of as TV just like you rent movies now not by

2477
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:32,260
going to a blockbuster like you used to.

2478
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:34,980
Just interesting.

2479
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:39,220
So Jason says I don't think Twitch plays Pokemon had a subscription feature.

2480
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:42,940
Actually they do but they make very clear in there about that it's it they're not going

2481
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:47,260
to give you special treatment that it's just for you know you support what they're doing

2482
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:48,680
and want to help them out.

2483
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:51,880
You know again hey if you've got a little extra money and like what we're doing help

2484
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:58,480
us you know help motivate me to do the next Pokemon game and program that before the next

2485
02:14:58,480 --> 02:14:59,480
thing.

2486
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:02,200
Tiger Claw in chat says we need a Twitch plays OLR.

2487
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:06,360
Hey funny enough go check this out if you haven't already Jason works very hard on posting

2488
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:12,380
the shows up to YouTube every week and they run a week behind just because we want everybody

2489
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:16,480
to download through the traditional means but for the archive folks if you go look at

2490
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:22,000
episode 541 on YouTube Jason did a hilarious intro that does incorporate the Twitch plays

2491
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,460
Pokemon thing into it so Tiger Claw go check that out it's funny.

2492
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:29,640
So there you go.

2493
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:33,960
One more story for you guys then I think we'll open up Skype at 1877 game OLR username orange

2494
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:40,520
lounge radio but before we get there a rare game goes for over three thousand dollars

2495
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:46,060
on eBay and what game are we talking about it is actually an Ultima game yes Ultima as

2496
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:51,680
in that classic PC series but it was a rare side story which I have to admit I've never

2497
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:55,300
heard of this and I always thought I kind of knew my up and up on the Ultima games but

2498
02:15:55,300 --> 02:16:03,900
Ultima Escape from Mount Drash it was originally on the Commodore VIC-20 from Sierra Online

2499
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:09,860
the company produced no more than five thousand copies the first time it ever showed up since

2500
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:15,700
the eighties was in 2000 and Peter O was a collector in 2004 that bought one for three

2501
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:23,140
thousand six hundred and five dollars he actually is the one who sold this recent one he was

2502
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:29,100
selling the copy it was the VIC-20 cassette in a plastic case the instruction cards in

2503
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:34,300
the original box and he lost five hundred bucks on the deal because three thousand fifty

2504
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:40,420
dollars is what it sold for so unfortunately the value went down incomplete copies meaning

2505
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:44,100
they didn't have the case or the card or things like that they sometimes go for like six hundred

2506
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:49,220
seventy five dollars or more so a very rare collector's item there Escape from Mount Drash

2507
02:16:49,220 --> 02:16:53,700
again I had no idea this was the thing but this was back in the day when Lord British was like

2508
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:58,740
programming those games by himself so this must have been something where it was like contracted

2509
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:04,180
out to Sierra or maybe it was it even maybe unauthorized I don't know I kind of want to look

2510
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:10,620
this up real quick are there any classic classic games Jamie that you would pay a lot of money for

2511
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:15,220
like maybe not on this scale but let's let's say you had that type of budget dark soccer is there

2512
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:19,620
anything you would pay a shit ton of money for like that probably get well it's not worth that

2513
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:26,020
much but I'd get panorama cotton you know it's a $600 game hmm which actually I think what it is

2514
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:33,980
is that they literally made like 500 copies of that game so it's super rare not there's not

2515
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:39,340
really a whole too many you know I might you know I might want to buy a copy of Emerald Dragon maybe

2516
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:45,580
that's a pretty good game I got more information on what this game is all about the Ultima escape

2517
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:49,980
from Mount Drash here's the deal it wasn't rich written by Richard Garriott but it was by his

2518
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:55,620
friend Keith Zabala we I probably mispronounced that I apologize to Keith for butchering his last

2519
02:17:55,620 --> 02:18:02,820
name but he wrote this game in 83 now Sierra had just put out Ultima 2 and so what they did they

2520
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:07,820
stuck the Ultima prefix on this game hoping it would sell better we've heard of this stuff

2521
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:13,980
happening before right one instance that comes to mind is that Konami was a team silent was working

2522
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:18,900
on a game called the room and Konami was like let's just call it Silent Hill 4 so they kind of

2523
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:24,060
you know had to put it into the Silent Hill canon so you know this happens a little bit in gaming

2524
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:29,380
sometimes you get side stories that get the the series name stuck on it there so it's a very old

2525
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:35,700
old version of that happening all righty we are gonna open up the skype line guys it's time to

2526
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:41,140
call us and I have your say on tonight's topics 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on skype orange lounge

2531
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:06,060
window she's kind of like getting all frustrated like why aren't you letting me out she hasn't

2538
02:19:39,340 --> 02:19:46,700

2539
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:58,260
the fact that frozen has won an Oscar the amount of snow has dropped about 60% swear to God nice

2540

2544
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:33,500
of oh my gosh oh I'm trying to get a picture of it but our skype lines ring it off the hook I

2545
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:39,540
can't like the webcam keeps cutting out there damn it I missed it you got to do another screenshot

2547
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:49,500
enough fair enough what's on your mind I just called talking about the whole new way upgrading

2548
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:54,780
your older machines and so because this is something I do on occasion and even now yes it's

2549
02:20:54,780 --> 02:21:01,940
harder to upgrade a laptop for gaming but a desktop it's not that hard I mean not for nothing my last

2550
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:09,940
major upgrade was about three years ago I dropped out 300 bucks on a new video card motherboard and

2551
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:15,860
processor and it wasn't bad because you can get a pretty good video card for like 50 bucks

2552
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:22,380
mm-hmm really expensive ones are for people who really just want to eat sleep drink game that

2553
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:29,740
really technical aspect of it right and like it like I said about almost a month ago one of my

2554
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:35,220
hard drives crashed I went out and bought a new three terabyte drive micro center had it for 109

2555
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:41,900
walked over to Best Buy instant price match done nice that wasn't bad it's just you kind of know

2556
02:21:41,900 --> 02:21:46,820
where to look and yes even though Amazon does so computer parts just be careful I've been seeing

2557
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:54,020
people selling like 80 and 120 gig hard drives for like 99 bucks and stuff like that not like

2558
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:58,540
you get a lot of that reseller shit on Amazon so you got to be careful that when you're buying

2559
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:03,180
from Amazon you're buying from actual Amazon well I mean sometimes the resellers are okay but do

2560
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:07,740
your research a little bit because you get a lot of that make sure if you want it to be you know

2561
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:11,600
still like sealed and all that get it from actual Amazon like if I really want to get a PlayStation

2562
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:16,100
4 camera not to like throw it back to a topic from a while ago but I am I could get one on Amazon

2563
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:19,220
but it's gonna be through a reseller for like seriously they're charging like a hundred and

2564
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:25,060
eighty bucks for a camera that's supposed to be $50 buck and what's interesting is that like last

2565
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:31,900
week I went I finally got myself um a DualShock 3 Amazon had of a 39 price matching at Best Buy but

2566
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:40,860
on the next ad down a third-party reseller was selling it for $35 nice so do your research a

2567
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:47,220
little bit people mm-hmm we're in an age of an economic crisis we have to save and pay people

02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:15,580
our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give our show a call and I gotta say

2573
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:18,940
though the skype lines ringing off the hook tonight it's gonna be it's gonna be tough for

2574
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:22,100
some of you to get through but we do have another call coming in so let's get to it hi on orange

2575
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:27,180
lounge radio who's this this is Bobby hey Bobby it's our friend Bobby bachoff how you doing buddy

2576
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:33,300
I'm doing good what's on your mind oh I called in because you guys completely glossed over the

2577
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:39,700
important part of a story earlier oh we never do that come on completely glossed over and I

2578
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:44,340
spent 20 minutes on my show talking about it's because everyone listened to you it's only a

2579
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:48,980
three-hour show Bobby yeah yeah we might have glossed over it because it was something that

2580
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:53,780
you went and it went into more death we try we try not to Jack your style too often here at our

2581
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:58,060
show Bobby but please what do you what do you want to what do you want to go back and refocus on but

2582
02:23:58,060 --> 02:24:04,540
but it is king.com losing the candy trademark is that a good thing or a bad thing it's misdirection

2583
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:10,940
they got rid of it because they don't need it anymore they got that candy crusher trademark

2584
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:15,940
from 2004 so they don't need the candy trademark so they can do the good PR thing and have podcasts

2585
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:21,060
say oh this is a good thing King is the evil K is backing off and they're not they're just using

2586
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:26,260
a different more effective weapon to bludgeon their enemies with so so you don't think this

2587
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:31,540
this like they're gonna let the candy swipe thing go without a fight despite all of the negative

2588
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:36,420
press it's caused them because my thought was that they were okay so maybe they're relying on

2589
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:40,260
this other trademark but maybe they're not just is this another one of the ones that they got from

2590
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:46,700
Europe no this was one they got from a US company hmm because I know part of the weird thing about

2591
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:53,460
trademark law here is that if you don't in try to defend it you'll lose it so maybe I don't know

2592
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:56,820
maybe they're trying to default to something that they don't have to be as aggressive and defending

2593
02:24:56,820 --> 02:25:00,340
I mean I I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt even though I might be a little foolish in

2594
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:06,420
doing so but yeah I mean that that could be it but I mean it is it was harder for them to take

2595
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:11,240
on candy swipe with a candy trademark that they're just getting right but the 2004 trademark yeah

2596
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:16,880
they can definitely use that to bludgeon their enemies with and even in and you know spoiler

2597
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:20,880
alert and you know behind-the-scenes stuff I actually can see all our show role because I

2598
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:26,320
run the website so I can see everything you can the finalized one though I don't see the finalized

2599
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:31,000
one but I see where you guys put all of it put all the stories and even the article that you guys

2600
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:36,180
used as a link has a statement from King stating we're getting rid of the candy trademark cuz we

2601
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:41,040
don't need it anymore cuz we got the candy crusher trademark mm-hmm so they've even come out and

2602
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,840
said oh yeah we're not stopping what we're doing we just have a better way of doing it

2603
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:50,440
Jason in our chat room says I dislike black wolves tack on this I didn't even take on this

2604
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:54,360
because they have the right to defend their trademark the exception is of course that their

2605
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:59,960
game 2012 came out after someone else's 2010 as far as them defending their own game I don't have

2606
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:06,520
a problem with it I I don't have a problem with it either when people are making puzzle games

2607
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:12,040
involving candy that like literally step on the toes of what candy crush saga is trying to do

2608
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:17,160
like with a very similar name but you know we all heard the story about banner saga a couple

2609
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:21,040
weeks like that that was that was fuckery right there like there was no reason well I mean there

2610
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:25,320
was reason for it but it was it was a ridiculous reason none of us agreed with that and I think if

2611
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:30,560
a developer wants to make a game that happens to be about candy that otherwise has nothing to do

2612
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:37,240
with like let's say Milton Bradley wants to put out candy land for the Xbox one using connect for

2613
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:41,560
you know four and five year olds to play dancing like crazy in front of the connector whatever I

2614
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:47,440
think they should be allowed to do that yeah and and that but I mean and even Jason says you know

2615
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:51,640
if they use whatever 2004 game take out st. candy swipe that's that that's exactly what they did

2616
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:57,520
that's exactly how they got him to take down his game is that he was fighting their candy

2617
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:02,000
trademark so they bought candy crusher waved that around and there was nothing he could do about it

2618
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,160
now they're like oh well we don't need the candy trademark let's abandon it everybody will say this

2619
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:11,680
is a good thing and we'll just use candy crusher to do what we wanted to do initially because it

2620
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:17,840
predates all these other games that predated us well well fair enough thank you thank you for

2621
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:24,040
reminding us why this company is still evil yes and just to be fair we didn't exactly tell

2622
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:29,880
everyone it's safe to install candy crush saga again no no and when you were discussing this on

2623
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:35,200
your show that's when we were opening the wine sorry yeah but it is safe to install the unity

2624
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:41,320
web player and go to flappy dot vog network comm yeah because Firefox had an update I this happened

2625
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:46,280
to me yesterday and it's like this did it when I tried to load up the unity player it actually had

2626
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:51,000
like this big warning saying this pull of this plug-in is vulnerable so we've disabled it that

2627
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:56,480
happened to hmm so just upgrade it and it'll be fine yes we are not trying to read the contents

2628
02:27:56,480 --> 02:28:01,440
of your computer and what porn sites you may or may not be visiting and all that because I God

2629
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:07,480
no I don't want to see that all right Bobby quickly please plug your show for our audience

2630
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:11,000
I have a hard time believing there's anybody out there listening to this that doesn't know of your

2631
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,360
show but just in case give us a quick plug and then we'll let you go it's Bobby Black Wolf show

2632
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:19,440
I named it after myself so Jay Leno because he's unemployed right now he doesn't take take over

2633
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:25,200
the show it's 8 p.m. Eastern 5 p.m. Pacific right here before olr and I even run long into olr

2634
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:31,760
time and they graciously allow me to do that and I do fog and and and flappy fog which is over now

2635
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:36,720
jokes over I'm gonna move on now the joke is over step away from the joke but but at least experience

2636
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:40,040
character pack to a couple times before you get away from it completely all right that's right

2637
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:44,720

2638
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:51,760
bye all right one eight seven seven game olr is the place to give us a call or our username on

2639
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:55,560
Skype orange lounge radio all one word and we're there's a lot of calls coming through tonight I'm

2640
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:59,320
gonna try to get to them all so I keep keep trying guys sorry if you're not getting through right

2641
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:05,760
away but it's it's a race of sorts and the buffer that we have similar to what twitch plays Pokemon

2642
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:13,480
has that whole like 45 second buffer makes it a very challenging type of game so once again the

2643
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:23,880
phones are open and let's see I could try to go to could try to go to the Twitter's just take a

2644
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:31,040
topic but I think nope we got a call coming in let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio

2645
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:38,400
who's this oops sorry try again hi you're on orange launch radio who's this gamer girl hey

2646
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:46,120
gamer girl what's on your mind my friend um nothing much just uh plan some lightning returns

2647
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:51,160
some lightning returns you know we haven't talked a lot about lightning returns here on the show

2648
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:58,680
what's up how is lightning returns it's really frustrating at first but I learned that you could

2649
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:03,160
actually um if you don't complete the game like you're supposed to you can actually replay it

2650
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:10,080
oh right because isn't it isn't the whole little twist in lightning returns that like you have 13

2651
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:15,080
days to do it but if you screw up and you don't get things done you can start back from the

2652
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:21,200
beginning but it's like it's like a new game plus type of thing or something yeah yeah you first you

2653
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:28,680
start out with like six days on the clock and then with each I think it's called a seed that

2654
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:37,520
you add to the tree and heaven it adds more time to the clock mm-hmm like the more more days the

2655
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:45,440
clock and I'm already on day four and I just started playing yesterday nice so yeah it's kind

2656
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:51,880
of like is it kind of like um Zelda Majora's Mask where it's like you know 72 hours remain and all

2657
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:58,600
that kind of that yeah looming doom is there a big is there a big angry face moon in the

2658
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:06,080
sky that's about to hit the earth not really but it's a movie much um you pretty much it's it's

2659
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:11,800
like the same thing exactly because you have only a certain amount of days like I said and it gets

2660
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:17,200
really frustrating at first if you don't know how to do it so for those of you who want to buy the

2661
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:23,640
game or if you don't have it yet I highly suggest getting the strategy guide because you're gonna

2662
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:28,560
need it you're gonna need it how do you how do you feel about lightning returns compared to other

2663
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,480
games in the final fantasy 13 series like because I see fifth dream in our chat room over at live

2664
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:36,520
dot vog network comm says I'm not sure how I feel about lightning returns at this point where are

2665
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:40,720
you at in comparison to the original 13 because I feel so weird saying that the original Final

2666
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:48,520
Fantasy 13 and then 13 to how is it for you the only thing I don't like is the fighting system

2667
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:53,200
because you only have a certain amount of button presses before you can't you have to wait before

2668
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:59,920
your um I don't know what it's called but before it regenerates right and as with the original

2669
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:06,520
Final Fantasy 13 the first ones you could just press buttons and there's no there's no penalty

2670
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:13,120
for it and also there's a penalty system if you run away from your enemies unless you're playing

2671
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:21,080
on easy but if you're playing on like normal then you have a penalty system so that's kind of

2672
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,960
frustrating I'm like oh well I guess there's gotta be that's that's the challenge in the game if they

2673
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:30,560
just handed it to you that wouldn't be much of a game there so yeah fifth dream says you lose an

2674
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,360
hour if you run so interesting um what else you've been playing lately anything else you want to

2675
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:42,560
share with us um minecraft I'm playing a lot of minecraft have you been playing on the vog network

2676
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:48,680
server um I don't know what the server is for that one because I mean I'm playing on ps3 so

2677
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:54,360
I don't know if you guys are playing it that way oh no we're not on ps3 we're on PC so yeah the

2678
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:58,560
piece ps3 one doesn't let you connect to PC servers fingers crossed that maybe the ps4 one

2679
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:03,040
will but I don't I don't know for sure if it will or not we don't know much about the ps4 version

2680
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:10,520
so mad about ps4 so bad why so mad because one of my favorite games is not gonna be on ps3 so I

2681
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:18,080
have to buy a ps4 which is I believe it's Kingdom the next Kingdom Hearts oh yes well it's taken but

2682
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:23,680
no you're right to be expected anyway yeah it's gonna happen if it's equals are gonna go to the

2683
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:30,080
next system that's that's what happens but just think of it even prettier Disney characters true

2684
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:34,160
so I'm gonna end up getting it anyways I just have to wait for a price drop which I'm gonna

2685
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:41,320
be waiting for a while cuz I just got a Wii U oh how you liking the Wii U I like it um as far as

2686
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:46,360
like having to be able to watch TV and then game at the same time I think that's really cool do you

02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:57,120

2708
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:05,320
California I left you said you're okay with it what because we got snow so you know I love snow

2709
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:10,520
it's um yeah it's kind of like Christmas except everybody already took down their lights cuz

2710
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:16,880
they're dumb what I was going to talk about I called in to talk about that I have now stepped

2711
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:21,920
into the year I think it's like 2001 and I'm finally playing Kingdom Hearts for the first

2712
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:27,120
time for real wait you've never played Kingdom Hearts before I played it when it first came out

2713
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:31,520
for like half a second and I hated the camera like I thought it was the worst thing ever so I quit

2714
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:39,880
playing and now I'm going through the ps3 version and I still kind of hate the camera but it's not

2715
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:46,120
as bad as it was but man that games not a lot of fun sometimes I'll just say they did fix it up on

2716
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:51,760
the PlayStation 3 version I seem to recall so it's is it a little better than what you remember yeah

2717
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:58,480
the camera is a little better than what I remember but I still the game is not grabbing me yet I

2718
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:03,360
don't know how long it's supposed to take before it does cuz first of all David Boreanaz can't act

2719
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:09,480
worth a crap so he needs to not be in any of the other games I hope but that's perfect for squall

2720
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:16,440
because squalls kind of I'm squall I mean let's see even your impression of what squall should

2721
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:20,840
be is far better than what David Boreanaz is putting out in that game maybe Jamie should

2722
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:25,640
release like her own voice thing that people could patch into the game yeah that's fine I

2723
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:33,340
would I would use that for that's cool can you give us another squall line Jamie I have a gun

2724
02:37:33,340 --> 02:37:40,700
blade there you go way more interesting how far are you in the game just out of curiosity I just

2725
02:37:40,700 --> 02:37:46,580
beat the Wonderland world okay which that boss sucked yeah I literally for three hours last

2726
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:50,980
night yeah that guy is kind of a jerk yeah I remember that boss it's like the big it's the

2727
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:55,540
big guy like you go back into that room with the eat me drink me stuff and it's like a huge like

2728
02:37:55,540 --> 02:38:02,540
weird I'm automation chairs and stuff right yeah and then like I was trying to kill him and I was

2729
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:08,340
like maybe I could use some fire on him oh wait that turns his batons on fire and it just kills

2730
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:14,420
me quicker yeah it was so frustrating but now I'm on the Coliseum world so I'm hoping it gets a

2731
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:19,980
little better well it's I I am gonna say this I kind of think Kingdom Hearts 2 is a better game

2732
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:24,940
but I still love Kingdom Hearts the Tron level will piss you off at first just doing the light

2733
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:30,500
cycle part would piss you off yeah I just want to play Tron legacy but I know that's in the 3ds

2734
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:36,100
one is the 3ds one not in any of the ones that I have access to right now so kind of sad about

2735
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:41,620
that that's okay well welcome to 2001 Shane thank you and you're playing it oh my god I'm about to

2736
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:45,580
graduate high school that's amazing you're playing an MMO from 2001 as well aren't you

2737
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:51,580
I actually yeah I am right now playing Final Fantasy 11 because I absolutely love this game

2738
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:59,500
and all the changes they've made to it it's fantastic not 14 mind you 11 11 yes now I am

2739
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:03,700
a dancer in it it's the best you have been trying and trying and trying to convince it you're

2740
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:07,540
trying to use those powers of yours to make me come back and play Final Fantasy 11 so far I'm

2741
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:12,540
resisting though I'm no no no you have started to give in because he said maybe after the move

2742
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:18,300
I said maybe just to shut you up that's all I needed you're a year too late I I was back in

2743
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:24,300
it for like a month you know I was free to play maybe I was in it for like a month earlier too

2744
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:30,180
but I Shane is convinced that it's it's all of a sudden so much better than that okay quickly

2745
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:34,340
Shane you may not be able to a hundred percent convince me but convince Jamie convinced the

2746
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:41,860
listenerships well no I have to pick and choose my targets I'm already two operating systems since

2747
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:45,780
the last time I touched that game and I swore I would never go back and I'm a stubborn bitch

2748
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:51,380
all right but you got to try for me Shane what why why is Final Fantasy 11 cool now because you

2749
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:56,580
don't have to play with anybody you've got this system that's not unlike Guild Wars where you have

2750
02:39:56,580 --> 02:40:03,180
these NPCs that come fight with you and you make a mini party and I seriously in the past two hours

2751
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:11,580
gained like eight levels and that's eight higher levels I went from 42 to I'm just below 50 and if

2752
02:40:11,580 --> 02:40:16,660
you've ever played Final Fantasy 11 before you know that's not an easy feat yeah I think after

2753
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:23,940
like three years I got to like maybe level 54 on one of my classes yeah so it's just it's so

2754
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:28,180
accessible that's what's nice about it and you apparently don't really even have to buy gear

2755
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:33,620
until you get into the 90s because they raised the level cap to 99 they did they did put higher

2756
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:38,660
textures out for Final Fantasy 11 at some point right did they I thought they did I don't think

2757
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:42,860
they did yeah I don't think they did I'm I don't want to play it if the textures were much nicer

2758
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:48,660
and it looks I just registry edit it that's what I did it looks way better than normal we'll see

2759
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:55,860
but again after I move it's already playing Final Fantasy 11 once chroma comes out anyway so that's

2760
02:40:55,860 --> 02:41:03,340
kind of true I want that game so bad I'm very jealous oh Loki I want you to tell me more but

2761
02:41:03,340 --> 02:41:08,380
he can want to see it make like a private YouTube all right we should probably talk about this

2762
02:41:08,380 --> 02:41:13,580
offline but for now Shane anything else before I let you go nope it's just really cold all right

2763
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:21,500
well I put a jacket on mm-hmm I have a hoodie okay bye Shane bye one eight seven seven game

2764
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:25,940
olr if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype orange lounge radio I'm gonna try to

2765
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:30,380
squeeze in one more call because I've seen one more caller coming through I want to make sure

2766
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:34,180
I at least get the one another call and then I'll probably shut it off for tonight cuz I usually do

2767
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:38,860
about three calls but I have done six but that's because our show was running a little short the

2768
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:45,740
news went by quick tonight so um did you have any other last-minute stories you cooked up

2769
02:41:45,740 --> 02:41:53,380
Logie I still get to get to Twitter now all right oh here's that call we're gonna go to it and take

2770
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:56,340
this call and then this will be the last one for tonight hi you're on orange launch radio who's

2771
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:03,820
this hey guys Jason hey Jason how you doing unlike everybody else and the polar vortex and snow of

2772
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:10,380
doom I made it home you made it home it's good to hear from you in your Colorado studio as opposed

2773
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:14,700
to here in the studio with us well to almost I was actually at a con this weekend so I'm actually

2774
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:21,100
I'm actually at a hotel and I'm hoping the internet holds up for the call but close enough to home I'm

2775
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:27,020
actually you know driving distance with reasonably so nice and you I will have you know that in your

2776
02:42:27,020 --> 02:42:32,300
chair which was Loki's chair at one point but and he'll be back at some point but tonight hosting

2777
02:42:32,300 --> 02:42:38,500
the show you know last week was my copy of bravely default tonight tonight is Jamie's glass of wine

2778
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:45,340
all right you didn't call us to talk about booze though at least I don't think so what's on your

2779
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:50,380
mind Jason I kind of just wanted to point out something when I was doing the video yesterday

2780
02:42:50,380 --> 02:42:55,020
a friend of mine called me towards the end of the show last week so I missed the discussion on this

2781
02:42:55,020 --> 02:43:02,260
topic I am NOT and this will probably shock quite a few people but I'm not so sure that the whole

2782
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:08,460
Netflix Comcast thing is a net neutrality concern because there were follow-ups that happened over

2783
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:12,220
the course of this week so obviously you know additions since we first since you guys first

2784
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:19,860
talked about it on the show I'm I'm a Comcast subscriber I use Netflix regularly I never saw

2785
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:25,020
these problems and people have been talking about them being problems for the last I don't know year

2786
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:29,940
and a half and worsening over that period of time and there was an article that came out this week

2787
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:37,220
that even people people that use Netflix on their desktop see these problems people that use a

2788
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:45,580
connected device more specifically in Apple TV like I do never saw these problems whatsoever and

2789
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:52,140
this article pointed out that Netflix sends for whatever reason they send Apple TV streams via

2790
02:43:52,140 --> 02:44:00,780
a different pipe the short version of this story is that everybody on the internet has you know it

2791
02:44:00,780 --> 02:44:05,620
always boils down to one big backbone if people want to look at what I'm talking about real quick

2792
02:44:05,620 --> 02:44:14,900
go to internet health report calm and you'll see a grid of all of the major cross-network providers

2793
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:21,100
in the United States specifically and there's only one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

2794
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:28,940
of them if you are talking one network to another you switch across one of these networks these

2795
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:35,100
people do you know they don't do gigabytes they don't do terabytes they do petabytes of traffic

2796
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:42,860
a day wow that's a lot of bytes well it's not exabytes or yada bytes so we're getting there

2797
02:44:42,860 --> 02:44:50,460
eventually but it's it's one of those things where like Comcast was painted as the villain

2798
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:57,820
because a lot of people like I I I I derive I say bad things about Comcast from time to time too

2799
02:44:57,820 --> 02:45:03,980
for you know better for worse for I think also in general Jason I think people aren't happy about

2800
02:45:03,980 --> 02:45:07,540
the large market share they're about to have because I think we sort of see competition as

2801
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:11,540
a little bit of a good thing and there's also been a lot of talk lately about is the internet

2802
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:19,140
a utility and we saw a case you know many years ago when what was it Bell or whatever was taking

2803
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:22,060
over so much of the country when it came to the phone utility the government actually split them

2804
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:26,300
up yeah and so we're starting to kind of ask that question shouldn't the internet be considered a

2805
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:30,660
utility at this point I I'm actually one of those people it's kind of like I I think it is I think

2806
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:36,700
we live in a society that necessitates the internet and I don't like I don't disagree with

2807
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:42,860
any of this I don't like the state of broadband in America the fact that we do have one cable choice

2808
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:49,580
one DSL choice at best and in like 60% of the country less than that you know by no means am

2809
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:54,380
I saying that's a bad thing I'm just I'm just basically I basically just wanted to make the

2810
02:45:54,380 --> 02:46:00,540
point that Netflix did this for a specific business purpose to better their service for

2811
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:07,500
people because the route that they have to take to get to Comcast subscribers for one medium

2812
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:14,380
desktops was terrible and they chose not to leverage the other links that they do have except

2813
02:46:14,380 --> 02:46:19,180
for one source of video like I said the fact that Apple TV's never exhibit exhibited these problems

2814
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:25,540
like desktop viewing did so there's there's a lot more to this story than just Comcast constraining

2815
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:30,940
and fucking over Netflix you know maybe maybe Netflix made the right decision they didn't want

2816
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:37,220
to oversaturate other links but there's a lot more to it this is a this is a really big story

2817
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:43,300
that just doesn't distill into well Comcast fucked up again so let's let's deride them for the next

2818
02:46:43,300 --> 02:46:48,060
five minutes and then move on but that's basically all I wanted to get out as soon as I heard it

2819
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:52,500
editing the video you're just saying that there's more to this and a lot of people are kind of

2820
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:57,180
jumping to conclusions and I think that's fair because in the gaming world especially I mean I

2821
02:46:57,180 --> 02:47:00,220
know this is a little more tech you know it's a little higher a little higher on the bubble

2822
02:47:00,220 --> 02:47:05,060
than than than gaming but we tend to in this industry jump to conclusions all the time I'm

2823
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:10,060
guilty of it we're all guilty of it we sometimes jump to conclusions so you're just saying you know

2824
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:14,700
what look look beneath the service there's a little more to it yeah there's this is a big

2825
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:21,060
incredibly complicated thing not only to the u.s. but the wider internet at large and it's

2826
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:25,020
fascinating when you die when you dive into it you just have to find the medium to be able to do so

2827
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:29,100
all right fair enough you might want to link that in our chat room that website you just gave to

2828
02:47:29,100 --> 02:47:32,700
because bonds double-06 says anyone got the site I don't have it I'm assuming that's the one you

02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:36,980
gave out I don't know but check in on that on chat if you will hey Jason I'm gonna let you go so we

2849
02:49:17,980 --> 02:49:21,900
time there it is all right so I'm gonna quickly go through some of these um act F senses tweet

2850
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:27,220
my little pony fighting is magic tribute edition is released by fans note this is not done by

2851
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:33,100
main six the original devs and this is the whole thing where they you know they had to end up

2852
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:38,220
changing it and the creator of my little pony was gonna help him out anyway no surprise that

2853
02:49:38,220 --> 02:49:43,580
the internet kind of did its thing and put it out anyway despite the legal wishes and so forth

2854
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:50,460
especially in a rabid fan community like my little pony but hope it's fun but I would I would still

2855
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:53,900
be looking forward to you know what's the new game gonna be that comes out of this what comes

2856
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:59,060
out of the ashes with that so it's like it reminds me of that you know that chrono trigger re remake

2857
02:49:59,060 --> 02:50:06,180
that square shut down in and up on the internet anyway act F also says ultra Street Fighter 4

2858
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:11,780
will add addition select so you can choose which version of your character to use notice that's

2859
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:17,720
edition EDI TIO and not like one plus one is two so you can actually choose do I want to play

2860
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:23,360
regular championship or so forth because there's so many Street Fighter fours at this point sheesh

2861
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:30,080
all right some other tweets we got s2100 Matt tweeting us in a recent homebrew coding competition

2862
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:37,000
someone remade Castlevania in zx spectrum graphics that's awesome you know though the original

2863
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:42,600
Castlevania was actually on Commodore 64 it might have been was it vampire hunter that they released

2864
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:48,240
it because wasn't that the original arcade it was vampire sex or msx so the fact is on zx spectrum

2865
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:53,680
not a total reach but still very cool I love the D makes did you see flappy bird on the Commodore

2866
02:50:53,680 --> 02:51:00,880
64 no hilarious and of course I love love love and bring this up again super hexagon on Commodore

2867
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:09,440
64 awesome there was a couple other tweets earlier in the week Eric RPG had sent us a tweet about

2868
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:15,400
about a game that's being made that's inspired by f-zero I'm gonna see if I can bring up this link

2869
02:51:15,400 --> 02:51:23,000
real quick here it's a racing and shoot-em-up hybrid that's being made and it's got f-zero

2870
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:29,320
influences and let's see it is a top-down racer with f-zero influences it's called the next

2871
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:35,840
Penelope inspired by Ridge Racer type for kind of interesting you can check that out at indie

2872
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:41,840
games calm if you want to see more information on that game and Flacco Jones also sent us a tweet

2873
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:48,280
saying this might be interesting for your show and oh yeah I remember reading this link this let me

2874
02:51:48,280 --> 02:51:53,600
read the headline for you from AV Club point one five percent of mobile game players account for

2875
02:51:53,600 --> 02:52:02,600
half of all in-game revenue in other I don't know this stupid website has an ad on it but anyway so

2876
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:08,000
I can't read much more than that headline but yeah point one five percent is generating half

2877
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:13,160
of the revenue for these games I'm actually not surprised by that whatsoever there's just there's

2878
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:17,320
some people that pump all this money into games you kind of go like is that what you're gonna

2879
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:21,200
spend your money on but you know what it's up it's up to somebody how they want to spend the

2880
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:30,560
money last but not least tech 2030 wants to give a shout-out to a Kickstarter project called koe

2881
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:36,640
koe I hope I didn't mispronounce that but it's a it's an introduction to the Japanese language oh

2882
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:42,240
well shit this is a game I probably need to play sounds like it's in the shell of a Japanese RPG

2883
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:48,760
but it actually teaches you the Japanese language sign me up that's similar to Final Fantasy and

2884
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:53,320
Pokemon hold on I'm trying to see it's actually out of the UK as well it's being raised in pounds

2885
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:59,600
but if you have zero experience with the Japanese language or you are well versed and looking for

2886
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:06,320
god damn it it is koe by the way because it says there if you are well versed and looking for a

2887
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:11,080
supplement for your studies or just want to play a JRPG for old times sakes this is for you well

2888
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:14,960
shit sign me up maybe I'll actually pronounce some of the games correctly in future weeks you're

2889
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:20,440
getting better I'm getting better I think I think Akuma JP was complimenting me as well which is a

2890
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:23,640
very nice compliment at least maybe I'm sounding like a kindergartener at this point remember

2891
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:38,440
you a oh I owe you just kidding how about this Baca all right you can search for that over on

2892
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:43,800
kickstarter if you want to see if yourself koe or it seems like somebody in chat just linked that so

2893
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:47,920
there you go all right that is gonna do it for another episode of orange Australia that's it for

2905

02:54:55,520 --> 02:55:02,840

2908
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:11,080
correct except for animated short which was a tiebreaker question on our list so I think

2909
02:55:11,080 --> 02:55:15,920
it may have won well at least that'll be some good news at work tomorrow right exactly yeah

2910

2912
02:55:27,360 --> 02:55:32,000
not allergic to the wine but um I ate some things tonight that I haven't eaten in a long time oh and

2913
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:37,440
one of them might have had peppers in it oh so hey Alan do we have Benadryl oh you have some okay

2914
02:55:37,440 --> 02:55:43,600
