Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, one cloud gaming service attempts to make a comeback using your existing library of games, and another adds more devices to be able to stream from.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Not to be outdone, the UyU wants you to play their games everywhere, with plans to become a service over the course of 2014.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 543 for this March 9th of 2014.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
And we're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, with you guys in our chat room,

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
live at the voicegeeksnetwork.com, where we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
And here in studio, of course, my name is Rob Roberts, and with me by my side, as she always is, unless she runs off to Disneyland or something, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Because I got fussed out last week. Sup bitches?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Sup?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Sup?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Sup, how you doing?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm tired.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
You're tired? Try not to fall asleep during the show.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
No, I'm not, I'm just sort of, I feel off kilter because of the time.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I know it's a three hour show.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
The day is weird, and it's weird outside, and weird all the things.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Daylight savings time is quite the evil holiday, isn't it?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Holiday? I don't celebrate it.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know. Here's why I call it a holiday, because they put it on a calendar.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
And so, you know, it's in the holiday section of the calendar.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It's a warning.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's a fuck.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You're going to have a bad Sunday because of daylight savings time.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Daylight savings time.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Well, you know, I was suggesting on Twitter, I said, let's just get rid of it.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Like, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are saying, but I actually have some friends that are like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I need the extra hour of daylight. Like, that's a great thing.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
So, okay, fine. Can we just have this be the last time in our lives that we lose an hour of sleep?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
We're done.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
I'll give up the rolling it back and the whole good daylight savings time that comes in the fall, and then we'll never have to lose an hour of sleep.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Is that the daylight giving time or something?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Daylight murder time because you're not saving it?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm just, I just, I had a weird day yesterday too, so going out to the BFECA.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
I heard, and if you don't mind me giving away all the details of your personal life here on air, I heard that you went out to Susanville, California.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Now.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Janesville, Susanville, some other dinky little place.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Here's the thing. Most of you out there listening have probably never heard of Susanville, and there's a reason for that.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It's teeny.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, and when you think of California, you think of places like the beach. You might even think about the snow, like Lake Tahoe.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
You might think about politics like Sacramento where we're from, but you don't usually think about the middle of the goddamn nowhere forest like Susanville, right?

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, this was up like, we actually did like a whole route. Okay, my best friend has a job that required her to go out and look at some places up around there.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
And rather than have her go by herself, I decided to be a good friend, and I said I would go help her out. She fed me, so it was great.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So, and hanging out with Becky all day is really fun.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Right.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
So, we went.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I would hang out all day with Becky. I hope you guys invite me next time.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Sure.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
I can make, I've been to Susanville before. I hung out at the bowling alley like a true Susanville person would.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, we, it wasn't just Susanville we went to. We went to Janesville, which is even smaller, or Jamestown or whatever.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
And this is going through like the really boring part of California. You go in past Truckee, past Reno, because you have to cut through Nevada to get up there.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
And then you're just sort of like in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden you drive a little bit on, I think we're on 38.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And then you're in a forest. You're in a national forest. We went to Lake Almonor.

03:55.000 --> 04:04.000
So, we circled back around to Lake Almonor, eventually getting to the Plumas National Forest and Portola.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
And then all of a sudden we're back out of the woods. And we were like in the scenic woods with winding passages and babbling brooks and shit.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
And fucking deer. Okay. There's pictures of the mule deer just hanging out in some guy's front yard.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I took a picture of him. It's on my Tumblr.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Here's the thing. As much, as much shit as we're giving Susanville and all this stuff, it actually is really pretty out there.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
It's super pretty. It's super pretty. And you know, I have to say.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
And fucking deer.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
And fucking deer. I know. But I have to say that I really enjoyed the scenery.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I mean, I got to see parts of California I've never seen before.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I just don't want to do it for 16 hours again.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Because I woke up this morning and I was in pain.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
I was like, my back was like, bitch you sat on me for like so many hours.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Let me ask this because it is a video game podcast. Did you get to do any like 3DS gaming or Vita?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I played some Animal Crossing and didn't tag anybody.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Nobody. Well, I always tag the same person in Truckee every time I've been there.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Like the one person with a 3DS in Truckee.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
The one person in Truckee. I've tagged them twice which I'm pretty sure I know who it is.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
I think it's somebody who works at Bespoke which is where I go get neat typography cards.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And the guy who, but there was a lady this time. The guy wasn't there.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But Bespoke is a really cool little shop in Truckee.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And you know, I go to the Truckee Candy Company and Got Fudge.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
I love that you kind of like, have you guys done this with the 3DS street passing?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Like you've kind of like narrowed down. Like it's kind of like 3DS stalking.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But not like, I don't want to use the word stalking, but I can't think of a better word for it.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Like it's like the whole like deduction. Like I know who you are.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Like there's a random person I keep trading with that's got to be one of my neighbors.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
And I'm like, are they an adult? Because they might not be.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Well I'm sort of recognizing a couple of people I tag at the Land of Cubes in Tech.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
And I tagged, there's this one girl at like, I always tag her at Starbucks.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And for a moment I thought she actually worked at one of them.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So I said, hey, does somebody by this name work here?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
They're like, no, but man, I tagged this person too.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Because I said it was on the, so it was pretty cool.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
But yeah, I tagged somebody from Argentina the last, not this past time I was in Truckee.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
The week before.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Nice.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
But no one this time. So I just, I grew a blue rose in Animal Crossing.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
So I'm trying to grow another one.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Did you, did you, did the grass finally grow back where Ed used to live?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
All right.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Look, he's been waiting there very patiently while we've been talking.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Hi, Loki.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
We've been talking about fucking deer and shit and we will make you wait no longer.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Say hello via the Skyline everybody to Techmaster Loki.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Hey, how's it going?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Hey, good.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Sorry to make you sit through all that, but that was a, I love hearing about deer and stuff.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Have you, have you ever trekked out to the great unknown, Northern California?

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I've been a few places, but I don't think I've ever been to Susanville.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, you're not missing much, to be honest.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
You're usually the one that has to drive, so you don't get to do a lot of gaming on the long car trips, right?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That is correct.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, I gotcha.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Well, Techmaster Loki, of course, joining us via the Skyline once again here.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
For those of you that have missed the memo, they had a baby about seven weeks ago at this point.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Eight? It's almost two months, right?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, about like six weeks, seven weeks.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
So, Loki is joining us via the Skyline while the wife is still healing from delivery, but she, Mrs. Loki is still doing A-OK, right?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, she's doing fine.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Awesome to hear.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
Hopefully, I don't know if we've planned the return date for Loki yet, but we're crossing our fingers and our toes that you'll be able to join us when we're back in two weeks at the new studio.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Is that looking like-

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't know yet, so.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's fine.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
We gotta let Mrs. Loki heal up and all that good stuff, so Loki will have to take the time he needs.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
But yeah, tonight, of course, is the last episode in the studio that we're at currently.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
And I gotta admit, with all the internet up and down time we have sometimes, I won't miss it in that regard.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
But Loki hasn't seen the place since before Christmas, so everything will be different for him when he finally does come back.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
Dark Sakura, any fond memories of studio apartment dump-a-roo that you're gonna miss?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, I haven't passed out on your bed here.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
So I guess, and this is gonna be a little sad, but I had very happy memories of cuddling with the kitties with Marco and Sanrio-chan.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Which, they both had their name as Maru-chan and San-chan for me.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And kind of answered to it.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
By the way, I found a picture of the fucking deer.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
We are concerned how the cat's gonna handle the move, but we think at the end of the day, she's gonna love all the extra sun that the new place gets.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So we think that'll end up being an awesome thing.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So, let's see. So yeah, we will be off next week.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Well actually, I should say this, we are actually still gonna do a show. We're gonna do a show in advance.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So it's not something that's gonna be broadcast live.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
It's gonna be an intentionally shorter show that we're gonna tape during the week.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
And then we'll actually broadcast it on the feed at the normal time.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
And it will take our slot at VOG next Sunday, right after Bobby Black Wolf.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So, sadly the interaction portion will be missing next week.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
But we will have something new for you guys on the feed, so you guys won't totally miss us.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Sky, better internet in the new studio? I hope so. It's to be determined. We don't know yet.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
You know, we're really at the mercy of our provider, so I'm hoping it will be fine.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
But we will see. I can say this, we're gonna have a lot more space.

09:36.000 --> 09:46.000
It's gonna be back more to those of you guys that have been here since the days when we were in the actual garage studio

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
that we would broadcast on JUSTIN TV, because Twitch didn't exist then.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
It's gonna be a little more like that. We're not gonna be in a garage,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
but we'll have an entire section of the house about that big that we get to kind of dedicate to the studios.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Because podcasting is such a big part of my life, so there's that.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Also on tonight's show, coming up, I want to make sure I plug this.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
This was thrown together very last minute, but that's how we roll here at Orange Lounge Radio,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
and I'm actually very excited to welcome back an old friend of ours to the show.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
We're gonna welcome back to Segg.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Segg, of course, has been here before, pimping some various projects he's been working on in the past.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
One thing he's gonna talk to us about tonight is he's gonna talk to us about a new game that's coming out this week, actually.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
This game's got a bit of buzz around it, so we want to let Segg talk about this game and answer your guys' questions live.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
The game is called Dom Pamplemousse, and it is about gender, the economy, and characters that burst into song.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
It's kind of like an episode of Glee, it's sounding like. I don't know.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm gonna ask Segg how much this game has in common with Glee.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
But I will say, it seems like the actors are all better looking, because they're stop-motion figures.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
So that's already a step up on Glee, so there you go.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
So we're gonna talk to Segg about that, probably at the top of Part B a little later on.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
There's quite a bit I could say that's a step up from Glee.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
There is quite a bit. Maybe that's not the nicest thing to do, is to compare this game to Glee, but I'm actually trying to say it's better.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
It's better, guys, it's better.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Lots, lots, much better.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, sg100matt, giving some tips on moving cats.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
I know it's a video game podcast, but hey, cat talk is important, too.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
sg100matt says, best way to move cats is to move everything into the house first, including the litter box.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
Bring the cat into the house with everything from the old place in it, so that way they recognize the scent of everything and be more at ease.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Luckily, that's exactly our plan.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
That's what we did with Shermie.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
We're going to move her when we move all the big furniture, but we're going to set up all the litter and stuff in advance.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
We fully expect she'll hide behind the toilet in the bathroom for a day, because that's what she did when we moved here.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
So, the more you know.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Well, I told you about Dan moving Shermie over to the house, right?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't think so.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I passed out, took a nap.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
The last little thing in the house was Shermie in her bed, looking around pathetically, like, where are all my people?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Where's all my stuff?

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
So, Dan comes in while I'm passed out in the bed, taps my foot, and then drops the cat on me in her bed.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And said, she was looking lonely, here's the cat.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
And I'm like, Shermie!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And then she died.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
That's horrible, why am I laughing?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
It's because the way you delivered that, you're awful.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I just couldn't help, you know, I miss my Shermie.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
She was a good cat.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I know you miss Mariko, too.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I know, but you have Midna.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I have Midna.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Midna's a little fucking brat.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
No, no, no, no, she's like, mom, mom, feed me, feed me, it's five in the morning, feed me, mom, mom, no cat, busy.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You're just sleeping, you're not busy.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And Will stayed over with his dog, Wintu.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
And the two of them were like, he tried to eat her tail.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
But not like in a, I mean, she tried to eat Midna's tail, not in a malicious way, just in a, what's this kind of way?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Chew, chew, chew.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And Midna's like, bitch, literally.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So, anyway.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We're only like 12, 13 minutes into the show.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
We haven't even hit our kickoff topic tonight.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
But this is going to be quick because I'm going to actually ask some questions of Dark Sakura and Loki.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Loki, you ready to answer some questions?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I know Jamie's kind of been chatting away here at the top of the show.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You ready to answer some questions?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
All right.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
All right. Here's the deal.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Here's why I'm going to ask some questions because I, you know, I try, I try to be hip.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
I try to be cool, you know, even, even as I'm getting older, I try to, I try to hang with the cool kids.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And I stay on top of like all the latest and greatest in social media.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
And I try to figure out, you know, how could, how could OLR or VOG or, or Hoard House or whatever project I'm working on.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
How can we embrace social media?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So one of the sites that I got turned on to recently was a site.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Can we kiss it?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Huh?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Can we kiss it?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
You can try. You want to come over here and kiss it?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
No.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It's a website.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
You said embrace.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
This is a new website called, well, I guess it's not that new.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
It's actually been around a couple of years, but I'm treating it like it's new because that's what, you know, older people do.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's a site called ask.fm.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
And I guess it's really popular with like the, probably like high school crowd and stuff because what you do, you ask anonymous questions.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Now some people use this to ask mean questions, but I put this out on Twitter.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I said, hey, ask me whatever you want anonymously.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
It can be about OLR.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
It can be about anything, you know, ask me whatever you want.

14:25.000 --> 14:38.000
Because I've been very fortunate in the position I'm at here at OLR where sometimes I get questions about like, you know, from people that might be wondering like how I came out or whatever and are struggling maybe with something similar without themselves or so I wanted to just put that out there.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Hey, if you want to ask something anonymously, go for it.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm pretty much an open book with three shows a week out there on iTunes anyway, you know, ask.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
So I've been getting a variety of questions, but some of them have been video game related questions.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
So I thought I would, I would give some of this ask.fm and share some of this ask.fm joy with DarkSakura and Loki.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
So you guys want to answer some of the questions that I've got on ask.fm this week?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Sure.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
You really don't have a choice because here it goes.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Okay.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
So one of the questions I got, if you were an RPG class, which one would you be and why?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
A class?

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, like a white mage or a fighter or a, it doesn't, you know, I'm, my mind goes to Final Fantasy, but maybe not necessarily Final Fantasy.

15:20.000 --> 15:29.000
I would be the fuck shit up bitch. No, I don't think that's a class.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
I don't know. I've taken like a bajillion different quizzes as to, you know, what class, cause I like answering the stupid fucking quizzes.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
So like for my Homestuck thing, I always get, um, Silph of Heart. So, which is like a healer class.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Okay.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Um, for most of the others, like I really love Summoner, so I'd probably be a Summoner.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Ah, you would summon the creatures of the world to kill things for you.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah. And then I'd sit back and read a book while they kill shit.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay. That sounds, that sounds very Jamie. I like that.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
How about you, Loki? If you were an RPG class, what would you be and why?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Uh, I don't know.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
These questions aren't always easy, is it?

16:05.000 --> 16:17.000
Well, I just normally play like kind of middle, middle of the road, everything. So, you know, like in Final Fantasy 11, I guess that was red mage, but, uh, something like that, I guess.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
You'd be like, uh, Edgar in Final Fantasy 6.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I, I think so.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Sure, why not?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Mechanist?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, a Mechanist or something like that, yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Or if it was Ragnarok, I think you'd be a blacksmith.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Yeah, where he kind of, kind of the tech guy.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Which by the way, playing a blacksmith is pretty fun in Ragnarok.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But it has to be a tech guy that never fully masters a class.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
For Loki. He gets to like 90% and then switches to a different class. That would be Loki.

16:42.000 --> 16:54.000
Um, here's the next question. And remember guys, I did not brief Dark Soccer and Loki on these questions in advance. We're doing this live, so these answers are very, uh, very raw and might take them a second.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Uh, and if you guys want to answer, go to live.vognetwork.com.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
Uh, Queen Simea says, I'm most likely blue mage because I depend on being able to imitate things really well for work.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
You know what, that was actually my answer. I said I would be a blue mage and absorb the powers of my enemies and turn around and use those powers against them.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
That was, that was my answer.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I do kind of like whatever the Moogles do in 6, where they just dance.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
They dance! It's a dancer!

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
They shake their ass at you and then you die.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Alright, awesome. Uh, Raginator says he's a berserker.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Uh, so there you go. Alright, uh, here's the next question. Loki, I'll start with you.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
What's the largest amount of time that you've clocked playing a video game?

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Uh, that would probably be Final Fantasy XI if I'm guessing.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I had a feeling. Why that one?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Because that's the one I played the longest amount of time, I think.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Um, even like Grand Theft Auto IV could be close.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
I don't remember the actual stats on that because I don't think they actually track time.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Um, but I mean, I played enough to where I was at, like, for the...

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Because we used to do private games, so unranked private games, and we were at the top of the list.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't know why they kept score on that, but we were at the top of the list for that.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
So, I played a lot of that.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Alright, very good.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Darsakra, what's the largest amount of time you've clocked playing a video game?

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, if you want to count just actually being logged into the game,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Ragon Rock Online, I did stay logged in for an entire week.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Because I'd keep switching to my merchant.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, because you have to do the merchant, and you have to AFK on purpose.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
But, I told you about the week I skipped school to play Final Fantasy VI, or III as it was over here.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, I did that.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Woke up in the morning, played the game, went to bed, I beat it in a week.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
And I was taking my sweet time too, just wandering around and writing shit down.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I wrote myself a strategy guide, Rob.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh my god.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah, because I used to be really super anal and take notes and draw maps and shit.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And...

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
I probably played that game like...

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah, I would sleep and then get up and play that game some more.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And then, um...

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
So that's probably the most continuous, but I mean...

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Keep in mind though, I've been playing Animal Crossing since May last year.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, and honestly, has the game changed that much since the GameCube?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Yes, a little.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
You've kind of been playing it consistently since 2002.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, no, not consistently, because remember I kind of quit the other ones.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
But this one I've really been enjoying, and I have a Blue Rose now, so shut up.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, now that I think of it, maybe even Dance Dance Revolution, I guess, as a whole, would be probably the most...

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm thinking of those sessions of playing. How long have you sat and gamed consecutively?

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
My answer to this was World of Warcraft, obviously, for the same type of thing.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Just with everything there was to do in that game and the social aspects of it.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
But I also tried to give a non-MMO answer, and I said, honestly, what comes to mind is Mass Effect 3.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And that's because of the multiplayer mode, in large part.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
I didn't play through it 17 times or whatever, like Dark Soccer did, but it was that multiplayer mode was a great...

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Last year, I spent a lot of time playing that.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
Actually, I'm going to say as far as continuous gaming goes, actually being up and playing the whole thing, the first Mass Effect that I marathoned my second time through.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Which is so funny, because I was guilty of this too.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
And this was another question that I got earlier, was something along the lines of,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
what was a game you completely misjudged the first time you played it?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I said Mass Effect, easy. I know you did that too.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Loki, what about you? I'll throw that question out there too.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
What was a game that you completely misjudged the first time you played it, and went back and loved it?

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
Once again, going back to the longest time played it, it's not a video game, but I have QZAR.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I played over 500 hours of that.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Wow.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
And then Minecraft.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I didn't get it at first.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay, yeah, that's right. I remember you didn't get Minecraft at first either, and you talked about that on the show.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Alright.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
Alright, I got one last question for you guys, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and housekeeping and all that.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
And this one's a good one, and this is very characteristic of the type of questions we really get on Ask.fm.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
DarkSaga, I'll start with you.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Because I already know, I think I know what one of them is going to be.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Oh shit.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
Based on looks alone, what two video game characters would you date, and why?

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
See, I'm not like an aesthetic person. That's the thing. I don't care about what someone looks.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
I care about the person behind it.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
You know, okay, I would go by, I could say by voice. I mean, definitely if you want to.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
But based on pure aesthetics.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Okay, yes.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Pure aesthetics.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Uh, fuck balls.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Dish, dish girl, dish.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
God, I'm trying to think. Actually, I can tell you who my first video game crush was.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Okay.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It's Ryu and Street Fighter.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Okay, that's a good answer.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
And so yeah, Ryu would be on the list. Even though he's like kind of old and grizzled now, he's still awesome.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And then Strider, hear you.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Ah, these are good answers. I like that.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
But that's based on aesthetics. If you wanted to go for hotness and voice, you know, I could tell you that.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
I was going to say, I was going to sit here and think Garrus. I mean.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Well, he's not really very pretty, is he?

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes, but the voice. Once you started to talk about the voice.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, okay, okay. If it was a Mass Effect character, I was going to go for pretty.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
The Bishouden of the game is Thane pretty much because he's there to be, you know, sleek, lizardy and pretty.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
And you know, have his own spotlight and glimmer and make you hallucinate if you like him.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
And the Citadel is so good with him. So good.

22:37.000 --> 22:51.000
You know, but as much as I adore the character for Garrus, a lot of the, I would say, attraction for the character has to do with, you know, that whole attitude and the voice.

22:51.000 --> 23:01.000
And I admit, I admit I like the spiky bit. That's kind of cool. But I don't know. I just don't think about outward appearances.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
It's fine.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So I'm seeing who's pretty. Strider, hear you is pretty.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
I actually called, when I answered this question on my own page, I put, you're making me superficial with this answer.

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
But I ended up saying, I said, I said Nathan Drake from Uncharted because, what can I say? I like Scruff and that stuff.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
And I also said default male Shepard for Mass Effect.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Really?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I don't think he's all that hot.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
Whatever. That's because you're, that's because you're Team FemShep purity.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
You know, okay.

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
Team FemShep purity means there's no such thing as male Shep. There's like, he doesn't exist in their minds.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
You know what, you know, I am gonna, fuck, I was sitting here thinking about it and you know what, I am going to go back and put Garrus on my list.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Garrus and Strider, hear you.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Okay.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I'll tell you why.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Why?

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Because actually I did think that the spiky bits were awesome.

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
And I did like the voice and I did like the walk and that's why I started playing Mass Effect to begin with anyway.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
So.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
All right. Fair enough.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Can I have three?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Sure. Take all you want.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
Okay. I want Ryu, Strider, hear you, and, oh, actually, you know who's better than hear you?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
All right. It's a three hour show, Dark Sakura, not 17.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Genjiro and Samurai Shodown was one of my other ones.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Okay. Okay. So fuck.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
All right.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Fuck.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
The listeners are dying to know.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
And I've been sitting here like not looking at chat so I can't be influenced by anything going on.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
They're all saying Garrus, Garrus, Garrus.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Fuck.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Clerical Error 404 says, Chris Redfield and Bayonetta for me.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Bayonetta's really hot.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Ooh, Bayonetta's hot.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Really hot.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
All right.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I'd hit that.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Hold on though.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
We gotta go.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Because the chat, everybody in the universe.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I do not like Liara.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Shh. Settle down.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
The entire universe is dying to know.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
Loki, based on Looks Alone, what two video game characters would you date and why?

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, clearly at the top of my list of me, if we're going by Looks Alone, it's gotta be the Native American woman from Custer's Revenge.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I mean, those pixels.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Win.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
You are awful.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
You're an awful, awful person.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Come on, Loki.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Uh, let's see.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
What else?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Uh, I don't know.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
They're video games.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
Um, I guess, uh, we'll pick, uh, Kinzie from the Saints Row series.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Okay.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
And she's this, like, hot, nerdy chick that's into S&M.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
So that'd be kinda, kinda cool.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Okay.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I'm with you.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm with you.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
And then number two.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
No, that was number two.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
No, that was.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Oh, you were serious about that.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
All right.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
All right.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Fair enough.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Fair enough.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
All right.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Uh, guy.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Of course, our chat room, uh, they're dying over there after hearing that ish, that one.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
All right.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Love it.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
GameGrew in chat says it perfectly.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
GameGrew over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Loki is magnificent troll.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
I mean, if we're, we're doing my aesthetics, then I guess you could say mama, because,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
you know, at least she'd be cooking something.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
You know, I, so there's that plus to it.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I mean, cause everybody else is just video game characters.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I mean, everybody good at killing things.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I mean, that doesn't do me any good.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
Mama does do the cooking and the gardening and the, and the baby.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
And the crafting.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
So yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
You're a bad man, Loki.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
All right.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I have another person out of my list.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
What?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Rex.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
See, once you got started on the Mass Effect thing, now there's no tournament.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Oh, come on.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
How, how lame is it that Rex wasn't romancable?

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
See, originally when you said Rex, I, cause I didn't play Mass Effect.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I thought you were talking about Metal Gear Rex.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
And I'm like, wow, that's just weird.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Okay.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I'd probably go after Snake too.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
All right.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Look enough, enough, enough.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
We're done with the, uh,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
You want to hide in this box?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Did you hear what he just said?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
What?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Do you want to hide in this box?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Sure.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
All right.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Gaming weeks.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What haven't I been playing?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
It's important to establish the frame of reference we come from this week.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
I did stuff.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
You all right over there?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Chat.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm sorry.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
All right.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Put chat down and tell us what your gaming week was.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Okay.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I played some stuff.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I actually did play Mass Effect 3.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I have played, um, some Final Fantasy 14.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I played a shit ton of Animal Crossing.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
And a shit ton more of Animal Crossing.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And I have a blue rose.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Damn.

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
And, um, um, um, um, I played some of that stuff we're moving on from on the website.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Just to hear how awful my voice is.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
And I haven't been playing Bravely Default because I'm still fucking playing Zelda.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
And I need to actually put some time into Zelda, which I will be able to do once I am done with other job.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
And I am going to be done with other job this week.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
And, um, you know, and Ronchon, I will, I don't know.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I respect Patty greatly, but I don't know.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
There might be some fighting going on over that bandana.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Um, but yeah.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
It's not like a whole bunch of stuff.

28:10.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh, and I bought a game that's called Year Walk that I'm probably going to be starting tomorrow night, to be honest.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Because it just, it was really interesting.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
It's based off of the, like, I think they said it was a Swedish concept of a year of walking or something.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Or a walk of a year or something.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But it looked like it was a really neat kind of first person game.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
So I bought that and I'm going to play it.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And, um, yeah.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
I've also been playing, um, like some weird mahjong game.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
That's like, it changes the tile puzzles every stage that you get.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
It's so weird, but it's kind of addicting.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So, yeah, that's what I've been playing.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Some stuff.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Alright, let's go over to Loki.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Uh, I didn't play a whole ton this week.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I did get to play a lot more of South Park, the Stick of Truth.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And the game is just awesome.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
I mean, the aesthetics of the game alone, it's just, it's like I'm watching the cartoon.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
It's fantastic.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And the humor and it's great.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
There's so many small references to all the different episodes in the series.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
It's seriously packed with so much fan service.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
It's ridiculous.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I can't wait to play the game, but I haven't been able to tackle it yet.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
But it's definitely on my to-do list.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Alright, that's it?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Just South Park this week for you?

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Uh, a little Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
And, yeah, I think that was it.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Alright.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
My gaming week wasn't too thrilling, but keep in mind I'm going through this,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
just keep in mind I'm going through this whole move thing right now.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
So, I don't have a whole lot to share besides I've been playing Diablo 3 quite a bit.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
Click, click, click, find treasure, click, click, adventure is Diablo 3.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
I've actually finally hit max level and I'm going through the Paragon levels.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
I think at last check I was Paragon 9 was where I was at in the game.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
So, yeah, quite the turnaround from not really caring for Diablo a lot a lot at first,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
but now I've been playing more and more of that.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
The 2.0 patch really did great things.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
The 50% experience boost they've got going right now is a great incentive to get back in there and check it out.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
So, yeah, I approve of what they've been doing there with Diablo 3.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
And that's honestly, like between that and Final Fantasy XIV, that's really it.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I downloaded stuff to hopefully play some more things,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
but just with moving and everything I haven't been able to do a lot a lot.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
So, that's that.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So, that's it for my gaming week.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
So, let's go to housekeeping.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Just a few quick things for you guys here and then we're going to get into gaming news.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Very important for housekeeping.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
If you haven't heard, it's been all over the network this weekend,

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
but over at the Voice of Geeks Network, we have a brand new show that just joined the network over the weekend.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
That show is the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and we want to welcome them to the network.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
If you've heard of this show before, probably because Grandpa, one of the hosts of Hoard House, which is on Wednesday nights,

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
actually launched this show as a Star Trek fan podcast and it's a lot of fun.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
I actually was honored to be a guest on the show this last week on episode number five

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
and we talked about a particular episode of Deep Space Nine

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
and I was able to talk about some of my stories about going to the Star Trek experience and some of the live things.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
And yeah, they're very, very well versed on Star Trek.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
So, if you're a fan of the show, we urge you to check out the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
It is going to be a premiere show on VOG Network, meaning we play it before it hits the feed

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
and that will be Thursdays at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
and then it's going to repeat on Fridays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
But guess what? We're going to do something new.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
We're trying some new things with the new shows we launched in 2014.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
We're actually going to preview a brand new episode of the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
We're going to preview that episode tonight after OLR.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
So, if you live listeners that like to stay up really late, we're going to play that show for you.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
And it actually happens to be that episode I was on this week

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
and it's the only time we're going to be able to broadcast this episode on VOG

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
because come Thursday, they'll be on episode number six.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
So, episode five, we'll play one time on the feed.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
You're going to hear that tonight, a special preview episode after OLR.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That's only for the live listeners.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
For those of you guys that are listening on the podcast feed,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
though, we urge you to go on over to vognetwork.com and check out the show.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
You can also check out the show on their website, starboardpowercoupling.com.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
All right, that's I think all I have for housekeeping.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
I know we've said this before, there is no show next week due to the move.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
We will not be here next week. We will be back in two weeks.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
But we will have a show that was priorly taped during the week

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
that will play on the feed and on the podcast.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
So most people won't notice a hiccup except the fact that next week's show will be shorter as a result.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
All right, let's get into the news. There's quite a bit that's happened this week, right, Loki?

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
That's right. One of the things that happened this week was Jack Trenton.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
He is stepping down as the president of Sony Computer Entertainment.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
And apparently his contract with Sony was up March 31st and is not being renewed.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
And apparently this is a mutual agreement, so I guess he's moving on to other things.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
And they're going to get some new blood as the president of the company, which should be interesting.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
As long as it's not, you know, kutaragi.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
We don't need cranny eating again.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
But yeah, so they're going to have, I guess, Sean Layden will be taking over as president.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
And he's been with the company for 15 years. So it'll be interesting.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
I know, you know, I haven't really been too familiar with Jack Trenton,

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
but I know he definitely made a good impression on people at last year's E3.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
So it'll be interesting to see how, you know, if their focus changes any,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
or if they kind of keep on with what they're doing right now.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, this news kind of, I mean, it came out of nowhere in a way.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
But I mean, these sort of stories usually do, you know.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
These guys, they have their lives and they, you know, sometimes look for other opportunities,

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
as many of us do in our own lives, looking for jobs and so forth.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
So, you know, when I heard this news about Jack Trenton, I was kind of, I was a little surprised,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
because I was like, wow, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
But then I also took a step back and I said, you know what, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
I mean, Sony, during Jack Trenton's tenure, has really had some ups and downs.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
I mean, he came in at a time when Sony was really being shit on after E3,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
and he really helped to steer the boat around.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
And there was some low points. It was certainly not perfect,

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
because, you know, the PlayStation hack and all that happened on his watch.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
But he did what he had to do to make it right and try to make PlayStation Plus a really great deal,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
which, you know, a lot of people are loving the PlayStation Plus.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And, of course, the PlayStation 4 very successful.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
So, in many ways, you know, with all the news we've seen about how the PlayStation 4 has been selling,

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
he's leaving in a way kind of at the top of the game.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
I mean, one could argue that, well, the Vita could be at a better spot.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
But, you know what, he's leaving on a high note.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
And I kind of go, okay, well, that, you know, you want to leave when things are on a high note.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
And we'll find out after his tenure maybe if another company has snatched him up.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
Sometimes you hear about these things in advance, and sometimes you don't.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
Like, I think about when Don Mattrick left Xbox, really not that long ago.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
That was announced right away that he was going to Zynga.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
But, you know, I don't know. It was just a different situation over there.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Could he be the new CEO for King?

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
God, I hope not. Don't even tease. That's awful.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Well, I wonder, too, you know, these guys that go that high up,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
he might not necessarily end up in the games industry.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
I mean, it's usually an assumption that they're going to end up in a tech place somewhere.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
But not necessarily. That's what I'm saying, not necessarily.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com theorizing, saying,

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
I wonder where he will go to next. Watch him go to Google or Moto.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Hey, you know what, nothing like that's out of the question.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
You know Reggie Fils-Aime over at Nintendo, very charismatic guy over at Nintendo.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
You know what Reggie Fils-Aime, one of the jobs he did before he was at Nintendo?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
You know what company he was an executive for?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
If I'm not mistaken, somebody might call me out on this,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
but I believe it was Panda Express was the company he was with.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Don't say that while I'm drinking stuff.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
But you like Panda Express.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
I'd have to go back and look. I thought it was Panda Express, though.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Well, Bobby said Panda Express.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah. Oh, I trust Bobby. Bobby knows.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
But yeah, and of course, obviously, they...

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Now it's some freaking orange chicken.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Right? The hot and sour soup's the bomb.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
I don't like hot and sour soup. But I love the orange chicken.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
So...

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
God damn it.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Yeah, he was with Panda Management Company as Senior Vice President,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
and then he was also with VH1 for a while.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
He was also... Oh, this is why he's a badass, ladies and gentlemen.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
He was also a Pizza Hut, so both answers were right.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
He was Senior Director of National Marketing and Pizza Hut.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
He was also a Proctor and Gamble.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And Reggie Fils-Aime, you'll love this, DarkSakura,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
Head of Marketing for Guinness in the United States.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
No wonder he's such a badass, right?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Fucking love Guinness.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Now I want fucking Guinness and orange chicken,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
and I'm gonna call it the Reggie meal.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Why not?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Then you have to...

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
But in order to fully be the Reggie meal,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
you would have to play around a Mario Kart or something when it's done.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Then I'd throw up.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I don't know. That just seems like a...

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
Well, if you throw up, then your body wasn't ready.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And DarkSakura has just died.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Ladies and gentlemen, she has just fallen out of her chair and died.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
My butt's half on the chair.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Rest in peace, DarkSakura.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby now,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
because did you watch Bill Cosby on the Daily Show?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
No.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
He kept falling out of the chair.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
It was hilarious.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
So I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Alright, fine.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It's a good thing it's a radio show, DarkSakura,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
because I can see you right now.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
My back hurts.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Alright, speaking of Reggie and Mario Kart,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
hey, Mario Kart 8 is gearing up,

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
and they're gonna really push the crap out of this game,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
because this is a huge release for the Wii U.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
We talked last week about how you're not gonna be able to play Mario Kart 7 online anymore,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
and does it or does it not tie into this?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
I don't know. We'll find out.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
In fact, we have a very interesting email on the whole thing coming up later.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
We'll talk about that.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
But Mario Kart 8 is on its way out,

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
and some very interesting sponsorships to try to get awareness out there.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
And one company that they've partnered up with to promote Mario Kart 8 is Pennzoil.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Now, I get that Pennzoil is obviously a motor...

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
If you guys don't know, that's a motor oil that they put in your car.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And if you didn't know that and you drive,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
you want to go get your oil changed once in a while.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Pennzoil makes other additives and stuff.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
They do. That's true.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
And they're big in the racing circuit, obviously.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh my god, could you imagine the Mario NASCAR car?

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
They need to get Danica to get rid of GoDaddy and advertise Mario.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
Well, anyway, so Pennzoil announced on Twitter that they are teaming up with Nintendo

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
to promote Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
and they're actually planning a demo at South by Southwest,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
which is obviously a huge event down in Austin that they do.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So, you know, no surprise, they're taking the game there.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
But it's just interesting that Pennzoil is kind of the sponsor.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Usually, you don't... I don't know.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
I don't know. That's just not usually the type of company I see partnering,

39:36.000 --> 39:43.000
but it obviously makes a lot of sense, even though Pennzoil is something I think of for real cars,

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
and Mario Kart is very fake in a way.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Like, look at some of the art for Mario.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
Doesn't it look like they're trying to make Mario riding Tron bikes best they can

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
without it actually being a Tron bike?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
And that whole thing.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Loki, what do you think about the partnership between Pennzoil and Mario Kart?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
I don't think it's that big a deal.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
I'm just wondering if we're going to see in-game advertisement for Pennzoil

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
and for all these other companies that they're partnering with,

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
because maybe they're not confident enough that the game will make enough money on its own.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
But, I mean, as far as, like, partnering with other retailers

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
and different things for certain games, it's not anything new.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
I mean, hell, they have, you know, merchandising with Kinects and stuff for toys, so why not?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Some folks in chat correcting me.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Dark Tetsuya said, I said Mario Kart 7, and I think you meant Mario Kart Wii.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Mario Kart 7 isn't, yeah, I misspoke.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Mario Kart 7 is 3DS, sorry.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Yes, I meant Mario Kart Wii.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
But I'm sure there's people playing Mario Kart 7 as well.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
But you can still play that through Nintendo Network as far as I know, so sorry about that.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I did misspeak.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
Also in our chat room, Tigerclaw says it's a real-life Mario Kart, I guess,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
and he actually links me to his story.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
Also, one other quick note on Mario Kart, because, you know, it's not that far away, all things considered,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
for such a huge game, just a couple months away.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
Mario Kart's going to get a limited edition in Europe for Mario Kart 8.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
It will come with a spiny shell collector's item.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Yes, you can have your very own blue shell.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
No word if it will work if you throw it at people on the freeway, however.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
It has a tail, but, like, two butt holes.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
It actually looks kind of like a face with a weird helmet on it.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
That's where the leg goes, that's where the other leg goes.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
But it looks like either two butt holes or a weird face with a spiky helmet on it.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Well, how else is it supposed to rock it up to first place?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I approve of that fart joke.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
Oh my gosh. Anyway, so yeah, there you go.

41:48.000 --> 41:54.000
You can check that out. You can pre-order either retail or you can pre-order as a standalone game,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and you can get a Mario Kart themed key ring.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Again, that is all in the UK.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
No word if we have anything similar here in the US,

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
although I would think they're going to try to do something here in the US,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
especially for the Nintendo diehards.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
Like, even a soundtrack or something. Who knows?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
If I were to guess, they'd probably announce something on another Nintendo Direct,

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
usually between once they've announced the date for the game and when it comes out.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
But it's nothing so far that I've heard of.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
Gotcha. So, that's pretty cool that Mario Kart 8 is going to be at South by Southwest.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I know people really want to play this game.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
Do you think Nintendo might have some hands-on availability soon for the game?

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Like, you know, they've got those demo kiosks all over, like Game Stops and stuff, right?

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Do you think they might have some hands-on availability really soon?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Maybe. It'd be a good way to sell the system.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I would think so. I would keep an eye on that stuff,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
because I bet they're going to have the Mario Kart demos playable really soon

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
at places like Game Stop and all that stuff, so check that out.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Because I seem to recall some of the other Nintendo stuff.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
They had about six weeks before it was actually out there.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Like, remember the E3 demos they had?

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I want to say Mario was available in the stores beforehand,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
so I would think you're going to start to see Mario Kart 8, like, at the end of the month.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
Alright, let's move on. More news. DarkSakura.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
I got some stuff. This is actually about Keiji Inafune.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
As we know, he's the guy who created Mega Man,

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
but there is a 2D side-scroller game coming up for the 3DS eShop called Azure Striker Gunvolt,

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
which is supposed to play as some dude named Gunvolt,

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
and he has lightning powers, and he's trying to...

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
He's actually running away from a psychic girl that he was trying to kill.

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
But it looks like one of the Mega Man games as far as how it plays,

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
but it's got some other stuff going on with it that just...

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
It's supposed to change exactly how it plays, and I was watching a little bit of the play,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
and it seems like it's pretty neat.

44:01.000 --> 44:09.000
He's also collaborating with Team Ninja on a zombie spin-off game called...

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
A zombie spin-off of Ninja Gaiden called Yaba.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Azure Striker Gunvolt is going to be out in Japan in the summer,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
but nothing about the west, of course.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
I had no idea. I guess I just wasn't paying good enough attention.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
I had no idea that he was working on anything besides that Kickstarter project at all.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
This information came out from Gematsu.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
He announced it at the BitSummit Indie Games Festival in Kyoto.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
Which is interesting, because this is the type of thing they could have sat on for an E3 or something.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
No, that's awesome that they did it at an indie game festival.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
It looks pretty neat.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Very cool, yeah. I definitely want to check it out.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Loki, any thoughts on this game?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Azure Striker Gunvolt?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It looks cool.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I don't know.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Hopefully it doesn't get lost amongst all the other games I have to play this coming month.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
We're starting to get into a crazy time of year.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Well, good for you. It's going to slow down.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Oh, that's good. Well, I've got to play South Park.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Once this move settles down, that's on my absolute to-do list.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
And then the Final Fantasy X and X-2 remasters.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I have to do those. I love those games.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Yeah, I don't think those are...

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You don't have to hurry that much on those.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
You've played them before.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I know it's not for everybody, but I've got to.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I've got to.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
We'll see. We'll see how far I get before I go like,

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Ooh, distraction.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
What can I do for you?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
You can make Loki read the next story.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Hey, Loki, read the next story.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Alright, I guess I will.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
So, we haven't talked about this company in a while,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
but OnLive is back in the news.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
They've got a brand new service called CloudLift,

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
and what CloudLift is doing is going to be offering

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
some different games on there.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
I don't know if they're necessarily rebooting the whole thing,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
but it looks like they have 20 games right now,

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
and it's going to include Saints Row IV, Batman Arkham City,

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
but they're also saying that they're going to have some MMOs as well at some point.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
I guess they mentioned Second Life Go.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
I don't know if that's any different than...

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I guess that was the one that's on Android,

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
but it's kind of interesting that they're kind of going that route in there.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I don't know if it's necessarily going to be console games anymore,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
or if it's going to be more like PC or something.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
Also, they're saying with that, they're going to have it

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
where you can, of course, subscribe to stuff,

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
be able to stream games that you've purchased on Steam or Origin

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
or any other services that are compatible with OnLive as well.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
So it looks like you'll be able to stream your own games,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
plus stream games that maybe you don't own,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
or you can buy games through them and that kind of stuff.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
So a little bit of a mutation of OnLive.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It'll be interesting to see how it goes.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I've got to say, Loki, I'm kind of with you

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
that I did not realize that OnLive was still around.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
I thought that they had folded for some weird reason.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Did they get sold or something?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Yeah, they got sold.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Oh, so this is the big reboot for them, right?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
I think so, yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
So yeah, I'm trying to see what happened.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
They had the OnLive desktop that came out in 2012,

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
and then on August 17th of 2012, the company laid off all its employees.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
So okay, so we're not crazy.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Something really big did happen there,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
and then they sold off the assets and started a new company,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
also called OnLive.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
Yeah, so with the OnLive stuff, like I said, they have CloudLift,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
which this is what they're doing the beta test on right now,

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
and that basically allows you to download games into the cloud,

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
or you basically own a download copy at home

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
and play it in the cloud on multiple devices at any time.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Got it.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
So they're saying also that they still have that play pack,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
which is kind of like how OnLive was before.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
It's like an instant cloud library,

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
so all these different games you can try for free and stuff.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
So I don't know, it's a neat idea.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, Tigerclaw kind of puts us in another light in our chatroom

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Tigerclaw says,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
This seems interesting because as your Steam library grows,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
so will the amount of storage required to install them.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
So having the ability to stream the games you already own

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
would be a good way to play them

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
without the need to install them in the first place.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
You know, that is a good thought,

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
because I don't really want to run out and get a new hard drive,

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
and I'm kind of limited with the 500 gigs I have right now.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Or, here's another idea,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
with the fact that they're saying that you can have games

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
streaming to an Android tablet,

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
you can take your Steam library with you on your tablet,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
just go ahead and play it on the go.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Maybe be able to sync a Bluetooth controller to it or something

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
and be able to play games like that.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
That'd be kind of cool.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
It's very similar to the PlayStation 4 and the Vita,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
the whole remote play thing, or even the Wii U in some ways, right?

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah, and then they also have the option

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
where they're going to allow you to play with a set-top box.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
So they have some compatible stuff,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
some smart TVs they're going to support on live as well.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
One being, I guess they have the Google TV by LG

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
that's going to support it,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
and the Vizio CoStar R2 that's support on live right now.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
But, I don't know, I think it sounds kind of cool.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Yeah, I'll be very curious to see

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
maybe if they have a big presence at E3 this year,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
as they did a few years ago when that company first started,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
and everybody was like, this technology will never work.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I remember being at that E3 going,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
this is never going to work, and it worked.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It was crazy.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Alright, well let's move on and talk about another type of streaming,

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
and that is Twitch.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
You know, Twitch has been in the news a lot lately,

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
and they've really kind of been blown up as a big gaming company.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I mean, not in the same way as other companies

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
where they're actually making games,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
but Twitch really is doing big things with gaming.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
And the next big thing is streaming for iOS and Android.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
That's right, pretty soon you're going to be able to stream, capture,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
and archive your gameplay on Android and iOS devices

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
when developers enable the functionality in their games

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
with Twitch's Mobile Software Development Kit.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
So that's an important thing,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
is that this isn't like something you're going to be able to run

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
in the background and stream anything.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
They're going to have to put this in the game

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and offer the Twitch support within the game.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
But I'm sure there will be plenty of games that actually pick this up.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Think of the way like Minecraft has Twitch streaming built in,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Path of Exile has Twitch streaming built in.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I can't think of other games,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
but I know there's others out there that have that all built in.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And that's what's going to happen on some mobile phone games,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
so they have to actually implement that.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
And so once it's implemented,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
users can actually work with video capture options

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
for like the front-facing camera,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
so it can be pointed at you while you play.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
Audio capture using either an internal or an external microphone,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
and you can actually archive the stream on Twitch and all that.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
So yeah, this is going to be very interesting

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
to see what games implement this and where it goes.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I would think that maybe Minecraft Pocket Edition

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
seems like a likely candidate,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
if Minecraft has really embraced that whole thing.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
It'll be very interesting to see what games implement this.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Also, big news out of Twitch.

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
Big steps to make themselves the new E3 place,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
the place to see all the E3 content,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
because G4 was the big place,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and they kind of went poop.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
And Spike TV I think kind of picked up the slack for a couple years,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
and I imagine is still going to do some things involving E3.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
However, Twitch has signed a three-year deal

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
to be the gaming conference's official streaming partner.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
So this means that official conference streams

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
will be broadcast through Twitch,

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
which if anybody tried to watch the Nintendo streams on Ustream,

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
this is great fucking news, just saying.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I would assume. I don't know.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Does the Nintendo Directs count as part of E3?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
They might not.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
But at least you know the Sony and the Microsoft ones and the EA and all that.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
That'll all be through Twitch.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
At least they have the YouTube live ones,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
because the Nintendo Directs over Ustream fucking suck.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
That's true.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Nintendo started implementing the YouTubes as well, huh?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I don't know.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It's yet to see if they're going to do Twitch as well.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
But anyway, convention attendees are going to see Twitch feeds on monitors.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
So that's going to be very interesting,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
like actually at the convention.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
There you go.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
No word if those monitors will just be Twitch playing Pokemon

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
or Twitch playing E3 attendees or who knows what.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
So there you go.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Big news coming out of Twitch.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Very interesting, the story of that company, especially.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You know, I know earlier in the show,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I talked about when we were streaming OLR on Justin TV.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
If you think about it, that whole phenomenon started as a guy

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
who wore a webcam on his head everywhere he went.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
And here we are.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
That has morphed into now this E3 partner company.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
It's really, really astonishing.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Yeah.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
So anyway, let us move on.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, I feel really bad for our friends in South Africa

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
because guess what they don't get?

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Titanfall.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
You know why?

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Because their internet sucks.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Basically, and this is the official word coming out of EA,

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
after conducting recent online tests for Titanfall,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
we found that these performance rates in South Africa

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
So we have decided not to release Titanfall in South America at this time.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
You mean South Africa?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
South Africa.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Sorry, South Africa.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah, it's coming out in South America, somewhere there anyway.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
So basically, they're like, sorry, but your internet sucks.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Get all of your upgrades to go in and we'll consider it.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
So another fuck you to EA.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
People in South Africa deserve to play Titanfall.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's a lose-lose situation.

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
It's a lose-lose situation because if the game doesn't function properly,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
then they're going to get bitched at.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
If they hold it back, they're going to get bitched at.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
They should have never announced the game in the region in the first place.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
Yeah, there's no easy, I mean, maybe they could cut the cord a little bit

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
with how much server reliance there is, but let's be real,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Titanfall is designed to be a multiplayer game.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
Invest in the South African economy so that you can improve web service there

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and then sell a bajillion copies of your game.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Not really.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
I don't know if there's that big of a gaming audience in South Africa,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
but there's certainly some people that are going to be pissed.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
100% serious.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
But, I mean, they need to do the research before they say,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
oh yeah, you're going to get this.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
So it's just disgusting.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
It's another way that EA is fucked up.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Ouch.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
All right, well, let's see what games are going to be coming to regions this week.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Sadly, we don't do South African release dates, but we do.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
I could try.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
We do start with U.S. release dates.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
So, Loki.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
Well, since we're not in South Africa,

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
we are getting Titanfall on Xbox One and PC this week.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
Also, if you don't happen to own an Xbox One or PC,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
you can get Dark Souls 2, I guess.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That's a good compromise, right?

55:13.000 --> 55:20.000
So that will be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Beyond that, there wasn't really a whole bunch else.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Let's see.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
We've also got, on 3DS at the end of the week,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
the brand new Yoshi's New Island.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So that will be coming out.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
And, let's see, what else?

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Oh, some other games here.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
Let's see, Atelier Asia and Loji,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Alchemist of the Dust Sky on PlayStation 3.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
And then, because this game is going to truly be next gen,

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
Putty Squad on PlayStation 4, PS3, and Vita this week as well.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
But you probably don't need that on PlayStation 4.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
And by the way, this wouldn't be on your list

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
because I know you do retail stuff

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
and this game is coming on Steam and Humble Store

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
and digital platforms.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
But our guest that's coming on later, the SEG,

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
wants us to make sure that we plug Dominique Pamplemousse

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
this week as well.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And that's on Tuesday,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
and we'll give SEG plenty of time to promote the crap out of that.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
But that is this week in the digital distribution channels.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
All right, let's travel over to Japan

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
and check out what's coming out there.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
I don't know if they get the Pamplemousse this week as well.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
I'll have to ask SEG how the worldwide stuff works.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
But I can tell you what is coming out on their consoles over there.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
They are still basking in the launch of the PlayStation 4,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
so we have no new games this week.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
But we do have some games over on the PlayStation 3.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Just like Loki mentioned a minute ago,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Dark Souls 2 is coming out there

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
in a regular and collector's edition.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
I don't know how well these games do in Japan.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Perhaps I see AkumaJP's in chat, maybe he knows.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I don't know if these games are very well received over there

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
because they're not like Final Fantasy games or other types of JRPGs.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
They're hard as hell.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I think there would be a certain allure to those, but we'll see.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
But those games are out on the PlayStation 3 this week,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Dark Souls 2 in regular and collector's edition.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Also on the Xbox 360.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
By the way, Xbox 360 getting a ton of stuff

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
in the Platinum Collection as well in Japan,

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
including Forza Horizon, Gears of War trilogy pack,

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
and also there's some Xbox Live membership cards coming out in Japan

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
that are Titanfall branded.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
But yet, I don't see Titanfall on their release schedule.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
So, I don't know, that's weird.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
On the PlayStation Vita, Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds on the 13th of March,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
like all these other games are coming out.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
And lastly but not leastly, taking a look at the Wii U and the 3DS.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
On the 3DS, we have Chujin Ultra Baseball Card Battle.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
For those of you that want to play baseball,

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
would you want to do it with cards?

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
But Rob, why would you be surprised if Titanfall is not coming to Japan?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The Xbox One hasn't launched there.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
I said 360.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Oh yeah, that's not until the end of the month.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Ah, okay, there you go.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
So, yeah, no, we still don't know when the Xbox One is out in Japan, right?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
We're thinking at this point it's going to be holiday, right?

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Ah, who knows.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
I don't know.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
One thing I am eyeing on the 3DS, this is a week off,

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
but on the 20th they're getting Game Center CX Sanchome no Arino.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
Is this the sequel to Retro Game Challenge?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Because I kind of think it is.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
There was supposed to be a third one coming, yeah.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
That is fucking awesome.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Well, that's coming to Japan.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Like, yeah, I'm almost positive that's what this game is,

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
is the Retro Game Challenge, the next game in that series on the 3DS.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Yeah, the Game Center, yeah.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Yeah, hot.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
All right, oh, quickly, I'm taking a peek at the Wii U.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Nothing on the Wii U this week.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Nothing new on the Wii U until the 27th.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So how about the UK, DarkSakura?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
There's some stuff coming out.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
I mean, we know that on the 13th Titanfall is the big thing over there.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
But before that, 1954 Alcatraz is going to be out on the 11th,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
and then that's for PC and Mac.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
And then, like I said, on the 13th is Titanfall for,

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
it looks like Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC, it's saying.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
And then on the 14th we have Dark Souls 2,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Darksiders Collection, and Red Faction Collection,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and Yoshi's New Island.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
And that be all.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
All right.

59:23.000 --> 59:28.000
By the way, AkumaJP telling me that Dark Souls sells like hotcakes

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
over there in Japan, since I'd asked.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Thank you, Akuma.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game,

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
O of the Week.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Loki.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
All right.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
So since we just got done talking about OnLive,

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
a service that we thought wasn't around anymore,

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
this one I'm surprised is still around, and that is the Ouya.

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, as a last-ditch effort to make themselves relevant,

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
they have launched a new, I guess, focus that's called Ouya Everywhere.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's basically Ouya without buying an Ouya.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So you are able to have the Ouya storefront and the OS

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and that kind of stuff, but you'll be able to play it on TVs, PCs,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
even without actually having a system.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And I guess one of the partners that they announced already,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I guess the first one, crazy enough, is their competitor,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
the Mad Catz Mojo microconsole, which is coming out later this spring.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And that will support the Ouya.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I don't get it.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I mean, because at this point, it's like saying,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
well, if I don't need the console to play these games,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
especially a lot of these games that are on the Ouya console are on PCs,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000
so why would I get this for PC to play Android games that are also on PC?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I don't understand.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Yeah, it's interesting.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
This does seem a little bit like, help, we're Ouya, help, look at us.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
You know what I mean?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Yeah, here's their quote.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It says, one thing you'll start to see is Ouya on other people's devices.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
We started with a $99 box, but we always wanted to create a console platform.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
No, they didn't always want to create a console platform, come on.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
They wanted to create a console platform that could live on other people's devices.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That was never the plan.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The plan is to make these microconsoles, and you thought they would take off, and they did.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
We just knew it was going to take a little bit of time to get it ready.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Now, we think the software is good enough.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It'll be ready to be embedded in other people's devices.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
We actually start having some of these conversations during CES,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and the take-up was so great that we're jumping into strategy with both of our feet this year.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Now, here's the thing with that Mojo console.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I think that even implements stuff a lot better than, say, the Ouya does,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000
because you can map the controls for any games, even games that are not meant to have actual controller inputs.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
They're just touch screen only.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You can kind of map them so that they work with it.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I just don't know.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Honestly, it's been a while since I've looked at the Ouya,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but their interface in OS was a piece of shit and a fucking mess the last time I looked at it.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
They must have done some serious revisions or something because I just don't see how this would be even worth it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's almost to me like getting the Amazon Marketplace on my phone or something like that.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I have the standard Google Play Store, or I can use this Amazon one for some reason,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
even though the same things are on both. I don't know.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Didn't you sell your Ouya, or are you still using it as a doorstop?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Oh, no, I sold it a long time ago.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
All right. One more story for you guys about a game that definitely makes people perk up when we talk about it,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and that is Portal. Who doesn't love that series?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Will there ever be a Portal 3, I wonder?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's not what this story is about, but it just makes me openly wonder.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Valve can't count to three.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah, Valve can't count to three.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
However, we will talk about another way you can experience the joy and wonder of the Portal universe,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and that is through a board game.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
We don't talk about board games enough on this show, but board games are pretty sweet.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Most of them. There's a few stinkers out there, I'm sure, but I bet this will be a lot of fun.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's the Portal board game coming from Valve and Cryptozoic.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It is supposed to be hitting shelves a little later this year.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
They don't have a final title yet.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The working title is Portal Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game, which sounds good to me.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I mean, it makes sense, and obviously everybody gets the joke with the cake and so forth.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Apparently, in the game, even though they say cooperative in the title, it's very uncooperative, as the title says.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It's very competitive where you play from two to four players, and you actually play as a test subject in a test environment,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and you try to either kill off your opponent's pawns, or you might get yourself killed.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Now, you do cooperate once in a while if you're trying to kill somebody else.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So, there might be that whole, like, oh, Jamie and I are gonna team up to take Matt out, but then we have to turn on each other.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So, there'll be some of that diabolical gameplay.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I don't know what you're talking about. Prepare for deadly neurotoxin.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So, and yeah, I don't know if this is what the game looks like there, that we're looking at a little picture here in studio,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
but that looks kind of cool, like it's got an isometric sort of look to it.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I wonder if it'll actually be like a three-dimensional kind of board. So, we'll see.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But yeah, you can check that out a little later this year on the Portal board game.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Would you check out a Portal board game, Dark Soccer?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I might.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I might? Alright.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Alright, well, in the meantime, Dark Soccer's gonna go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, this is a classic game.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
This time I'm riding a bicycle through the vault.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
That's right. Oh, you're gonna get on your bike and ride through the vault.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yep.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
She's getting her prop cycle on, yo.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
No, no, no. Not a prop cycle. This is a bike. Remember, we're old school.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That wasn't the game of the week.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And I'm running over people's lawns.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Oh, I think I know where this is going.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And throwing things through their windows and being chased out by dogs and people break dancing and cars.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Have you guys figured out where the classic game of the week is going?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's Paperboy. Yay.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yay.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah. Um, I love the music in Paperboy so much.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like this music right here, right after you select the level.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I have to, we have to hear this.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Which I just want to say for the people that end up seeing this on YouTube later on,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
because we do put all our shows up on YouTube as well at username OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The person who recorded this Playboy playthrough is like totally cheating.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Hacks left, look, he's riding through fences and through houses.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
He is the hacking.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Got it because it has the music.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yeah, this is not very classic gameplay, but at least it is classic music.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah, because I like being able to find the arcade music.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And this is the longest one I could find.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It didn't have people fucking talking over it.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Hey, look at me, I'm playing Paperboy.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Boy, I'm terrible at this game.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Anyway, you play as a boy delivering paper.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So you have to deliver the newspapers to your subscribers,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
vandalize the non-subscribers home, and still avoid all the hazards.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And you lose your subscribers by missing your delivery or damaging your subscriber's house.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
So you have three levels of difficulty.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You have easy street, middle road, and hard way.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Which, I just thought of the name.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You know, we're clever.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So you have to perfectly deliver the papers to your subscribers for an entire week and not crash.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Which will eat up alive.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And that's before the week ends.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And so you have seven in-game days.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You have Monday through Sunday.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I guess you get the Sunday paper too.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So, the houses are really easy to tell apart.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Your subscribers look like they have regular houses.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Your non-subscribers have red windows and black houses.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And they're kind of creepy looking.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And you have really weird neighbors.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Like, really weird people in the neighborhood.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So you have, as far as your hazards, you have fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboards, drunks,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
kids with radio-controlled toys, and then you have a tornado, oversized house cats, and the grand reaper.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
You also have to cross intersections that have motorcycles and cars going through.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And then, you can actually throw your papers, though, at some of the people.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Like the people fighting in the street and the break dancer.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And you get extra points for doing that.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And you have to pick up more stacks of papers as you go.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000
A perfect delivery is when you deliver to all of your subscriber and you get double points for each house that you deliver to.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
If you get a perfect delivery.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You also have a training course at the end that basically lets you practice doing stuff in different levels.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And then you get a recap of your delivery.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
The chatters are calling me out saying I called this game Playboy.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Did I call this game Playboy?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I didn't pay attention.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I meant to say Paperboy.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But you know what?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
If it was a topless girl riding a bike, that would be something to play, too.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That would be BMX XXX.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I guess y'all know where my mind was at.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So anyway, when you get anything happening in the game, you get an actual paper that shows your little Paperboy guy on it.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Like if you do perfect, Paperboy wins an award for outstanding paper delivery.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:45.000
If you lose all your lives, you get one that says Paperboy calls it quits.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And if you lose all your subscribers, you get a headline that says Paperboy fired.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
With a digital voice going you're fired.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And there's different voice clips in the game, too.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000
There's one that says Paperboy stopped me at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And then you get the list you hang ten when you run into a skateboarder.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And then when you run over tricyclists, he says I hate that kid.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So it's running on the Atari System 2 hardware with a 10 megahertz digital equipment corporation T11.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And sound and coin, it's 2.2 megahertz MOS technology 6502.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And the sound chips are pokies.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Same hardware. This is clearly the same hardware that ran 720.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Texas Instruments TMS-5220 for the speech.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
One of the Indiana Jones games was on this hardware, too.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And there's another one. Is it Rolling Thunder?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
There's another one I can't think of.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Well, at any rate, there is also a bug where you can skirt the finish line at the end of the training course.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And play the training course over and over again until you crash.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And so you get garbage data on the screen and you get a huge F-score.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
So that is a glitch in the game.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
There's different ports. We had the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And that one, some of those different versions you can actually play as a paper girl instead of a paper boy.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Which is awesome.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
There's a Commodore 64 version. There's a Commodore 16.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And yes, I played the shit out of the Commodore 64 version as a kid since you wanted to know.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Okay.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Apple II, TRS-80.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
God damn it, I lost my page.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:48.000
There was a DOS version, Apple IIGS, the Famicom NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari Lynx, which I have that version.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Sega Master System Game Gear and Mega Drive slash Genesis.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000
The NES version is the first NES game to be developed in the US.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
There were home versions that spawned sequels like Paperboy II.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And then there was a Paperboy 64 for the Nintendo 64.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It's currently been included in Midway Arcade Treasures and on various systems for the GameCube, PS2, PSP, Xbox and Windows.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
There's a mobile version out.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Paperboy had a release on Xbox Live Arcade for the 360 on February 14th, 2007, but it's been delisted.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
There is an anniversary version that came out on iOS on December 18th.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So the Paperboy appeared in an episode of Captain N.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Which, okay.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:48.000
There's a scene in Police Academy 3 back in training where the game is featured.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000
There is a, the game is on a BBC TV show called First Class.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And the Paperboy is in Wreck-It Ralph.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
He's hanging out at Game Central Station.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Oh really?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Yes.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I missed that.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So there you go.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Alright, that's a good one.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I remember this game very fondly.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I love the music.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Want to hear a little more here?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Yeah, let's hear some more.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
See, see, this is how I do the frickin' hearse.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I told you the guy was cheating in this video.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
He's cheating like crazy.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
It's kind of got a little Playboy vibe in the video.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
In the soundtrack.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
He's playing it alright.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Alright, there it is.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Your classic game of the week.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Paperboy.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
On everything.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
In the 80s, honestly.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
But started in the arcade.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
There you go.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Good pick, Tarsaka.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Good pick.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Thank you.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Hey, we'll be right back.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
We're going to take a break.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
We'll be right back after this break.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The SEG is going to be here to talk all about that game we were mentioning earlier in the

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
show, releasing this week.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Dominique Pamplemousse.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
We're going to get all the facts on that game.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And if I should keep saying it that way, maybe I shouldn't.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And, of course, rapid fire news.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The Fugu question of the week and plenty more when we come back after this with more of

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Orange Lawn's radio.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We are live, of course, on this Sunday evening with episode number, I think I actually might

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
have lost count.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
What episode number are we on tonight?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000
We're on episode number 543 of our show for this March the 9th of 2014.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And Loki, of course, joining us on the Skype line, right?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Hopefully he's back.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I don't know.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
He might have went AFK for a baby.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
No, no, I'm here.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I'm sorry.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Oh, hey.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
How's it going, Loki?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Going all right.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
So I know those of you guys who listen to the podcast don't really get to see this side

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
of things.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But in studio, we always take a quick break so that we can do things like use the bathroom,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
top off our drinks, and so forth.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Or in the case of tonight's show, set up an interview, which I'm going to get to and get

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
here in two seconds.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
But I literally was running back with like 15 seconds left to spare.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And now I've knocked over the iPad and I barely got the recording of the show started and

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
all that stuff.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But that's how we do it live here at OLR, right?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Rob, Rob, Rob.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
What?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Fix it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I'm trying.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And now this stupid iPad keeps locking up on me and I'm going to lose our guest if I'm

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
not careful.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Well, you know, somebody else could be talking while you get the little magnet attached.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
All right.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Well, there we go.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And we can finally get to our interview that we're going to start off with here at the

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
top of our program for this Part B.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And joining us on the line tonight is our pal, the Seg.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Shucks.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Howdy.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
How are you all doing?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Good.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
How are you doing, Seg?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Good to hear from you.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I'm doing rather fine.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Tired and a little stressed out, but otherwise.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Stressed out?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
You?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
How could you be stressed?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
You talk like it's a game release week or something.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I know, right?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So, yeah.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Oh, my gosh.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Who would be releasing a game against Titanfall, Seg?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Well, Dalek actually is releasing a game on Tuesday.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
But also me and Deidre.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
No, all kidding aside.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
All kidding aside, come on.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
There's always, you know, there's always these big, big AAA games coming out.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Like, you know, your South Park last week, your Titanfall and your Final Fantasy X, you

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
know, in a couple weeks and so forth.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But let us not forget the indie games.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Because the indie games, you know, they come out.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
And sometimes indie games, they take a little while to build, right?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Minecraft wasn't built in a day.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And some of these indie games become gigantic.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I don't know.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
There's some stuff in Minecraft that's been built in a day.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I guess that's very true.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But, no, you've got an indie game that you've been kind of assisting with.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I'm not sure.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
What is your official title with it?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Well, official title, Deidre came up with this, and I really like it, is Professional

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Extrovert.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Appropriate.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Appropriate.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So, my role is basically biz dev, community management, build, distribution, release,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
and all the other things for releasing Dominique Palpemuse.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Tell us a little bit about Dominique Palpemuse.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
So, Dominique Palpemuse is a detective noir point-and-click adventure musical done in

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
stop-motion animation about gender and the economy.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Okay.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You realize there's going to be a bunch of people out there saying, literally what?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So, this is a project that, like two years ago now, Deidre set up as an Indiegogo project

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
of just, hey, I want to do a thing.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And the budget was very modest.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I mean, I want to say it got just a shy over 10K in total, which, you know, it's a video

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
game, folks.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
That's very, very inexpensive.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And made this game that was done in all stop-motion animation, where Deidre did everything.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:22.000
The writing, music, the programming, and it's all stop-motion of real figures and sets

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
that Deidre made.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So, it's all pictures and done in black and white.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
So, it has a very unique, a very, I'll say, raw.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
It's not the kind of polish you would normally see in a triple-A title.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
You know, it's very, it has a very unique look to it.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
When you say stop-motion, I mean, if you think about stop-motion animation, that means literally

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
like click, take a picture, okay, move just a little slight bit, click, take another picture,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
move a slight bit.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I mean, that is an extraordinary amount of patience for one person.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And stop-motion, I don't think you really see that in, what video games out there had stop-motion,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
maybe like Clay Fighter?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Yeah.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
There were some, I think there was one game that had a sort of stop-motion thing.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But honestly, the whole idea of a stop-motion game just sounds fantastic to me.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yeah.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Because I like, and this was something I've been trying to incorporate in my own personal design,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
is incorporating real-life textures and objects in a digital environment.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And this just hit all of my happy buttons, so.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That's astounding, this stop-motion game that literally one person, it's a one-person show, essentially.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
As far as the creation goes.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
It's all Deidre.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Oh, that's amazing.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
It's done a wonderful job.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And so, it actually, you know, technically this game's already been released.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But it was on dominicpalpamuse.com, which you can buy it now and I'll get to where it gets new in a moment.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And you know you're going to have to spell that.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Just saying.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:10.000
If you, you know, our SEO's pretty good, where if you make a good attempt at the spelling, I'd know that it's two words.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Okay.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You're pretty good to go.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So, the game was released just through app, iPad, you know, through the app store, and just a simple payment service thing on the website.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And then Deidre submitted it to the festival circuit, and first it got digital selection for Indiecade,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.000
which is a really nice festival that happens in L.A., Culver City.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And I helped out and came along with them to showcase the game as the professional booth dude for the game.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I think I heard somewhere, and I could be wrong, but I thought it was in the news this week that Indiecade was announced as coming to GamerX2 as well, right?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Or that Cards Against Humanity was sponsoring something with that?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I hope I don't have that mixed up.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I haven't heard, but I've been in my own dome of seclusion this past two, three weeks.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You've been in the Dominique Pample booth all week trying to get this taken care of. No, that's cool.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So, a digital section was showcasing it there, and then Deidre put it to the IGF, Independent Games Festival, which goes along with GDC, Game Developers Conference.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And there wasn't just one nomination, or two, or three, but four, including the Sam McNally grand prize, the top prize.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
That's amazing. Congrats.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And they were tied three ways for most nominated title, but the categories that were nominated for it are the Grand McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Narrative, Excellence in Audio, because it is a musical, and the Nouveau Award, which is the Experimental Games category.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Get out. An experimental game?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And, you know, it is an absolute honor, because we're in the same space as games like Paper Please, and The Yog, and Device Six, and all of these other titles.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And just, you know, it's really a testament to the work that Deidre has put into this project, and it's really resonated with people that have played.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And so, with that, the morning that the IGF nominations came in, I messaged Deidre, and going, you know, obviously, congratulations.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Right.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And knowing the impending doom that was coming soon, I offered my services as what we now call professional extrovert, because one of the things I knew that was coming was Steam, because Steam has a tradition of outright offering anyone who has gotten nominated for an IGF, just, we can make money with this.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:49.000
So they offer the distribution on Steam, and I have a little bit of familiarity with releasing games on Steam.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
You know, sixty-four titles in a row by belt, anyway.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Not to.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But, okay, so this is how, you pretty much just kind of answered the big question, because there has been some people out there on the interwebs wondering, how come this game, being the super fierce indie that it is, clearly, pretty much all being done by one person, how did this game not do the Steam greenlight, but it's because of the nominations?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Yes, it's because of the nominations.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You know, we've been through enough of a gauntlet already, and to be at this high of an honor, it's a no-brainer, and always has been a no-brainer for Valve.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And it's also opened up other opportunities.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
For example, we're also with Humble.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You know, Humble Bundle Humble.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
We're not in a bundle, but we have a widget and will be in the store as of Tuesday.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Right, so many people forget that Humble has their own store that they're running to where you can get Steam keys if you want and so forth.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Yeah, and if you get from Humble, you will get Steam keys.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
PC and Mac as well, right?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Yep, Windows, Mac.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
No funny business.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
You get both.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And yeah, we're also on iPad, but App Store, there is no dials for us to turn in order to get anything rolled in with that, so it's sadly its own separate thing.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Let me ask you some, let me get into some real deep questions about the game, because obviously this game is tackling some pretty interesting subject matter in a very interesting way with the stop motion in the musical.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And one of those things that the game is tackling is gender identity, correct? Is an issue that's tackled in the game.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
So how does one tackle gender identity issues through a video game?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Well, you know, I don't want to speak out of turn with Deidre and the work that they're doing.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But it's really just, you know, when I play the piece, I see it as Deidre honestly trying to address these issues and experiences that they've had.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And putting it, you know, putting it to a game, but in a way that it's not, you know, it's not inaccessible to people.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Like, I mean, I fully completely identify as male, 100%, and I'm not put off by this because I know that this is experiences that other people go through.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And I am enriched by that because I'm experiencing things that I will never go through and I don't go through.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And, you know, I think this is really the point of art is to make something that isn't your experience accessible.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:58.000
You know, you're kind of hitting on the next question I was going to ask because the next thing that I had on my list here is that, you know, the probably the number one audience that listens to our show.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And it's no secret that the stereotype of your average gamer is a, you know, late teens, early 20s, white cis male, straight guy, you know, what's in this game for them?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
But you're kind of, you know, since you're many of those things yourself, you're kind of hitting on it.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It's about, I don't want to say storytelling, but it is certainly, I mean, because that sounds like fiction, but it's definitely like...

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Well, it is fiction.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Well, okay, okay. The game is fiction, but you're definitely getting some very non-fictional elements in it, right?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Yeah. You know, it's, you know, it's totally a fiction game. It's not autobiographical by any means.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Sure.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But, you know, it's, you know, this has definitely been the double diamond of promoting because it's such a weird, off-the-radar game in so many different ways.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But where I find people have the enjoyment on it are either they personally identify with it or they've had a great experience and it's not what they would normally get from other media.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And, you know, I mean, I know we're talking so much about the genders and issues and all that, but it's not like it's beating it over your head, you know?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And I think that's a very important point to make as well, is that you know this happens in gaming media all of the time.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
There's that one thing that we flip and fixate on.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Yup.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And then, you know, just like gaming media can't get over that one thing that that one guy said at that one conference, and then we like fixate on that, right?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:56.000
But no, I think that's a great kind of thing to put out there is that, you know, the man just said, it's stop motion, it's a musical, it's, you know, there's many different points to this.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Now, we'd love to in this industry inevitably compare games to each other, you know, like, oh, Tomb Raider, it's just like Uncharted now, you know, all this stuff, right?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
But, you know, I'm kind of looking at this game and I'm going, can this be compared to anything?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Well, it is your traditional point and click adventure game.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Straight up. It's, you know, if you like point and click adventures, you're going to feel at home with this.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
You know, it is that, that's the style.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So, you know, that's where it comes with similarities if I was doing the elevator pitch for it, if I was getting a publishing deal, is that it's point and click adventure, but, you know, in a traditional sense.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Okay.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:29:03.000
But it's just the content matter is definitely not what you would normally get from most other works and, you know, we are all so blessed to be able to reach this kind of audience.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Both, you know, first of all, thankful for the backers that funded this to make this happen.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And really, that was all, that was going to be it.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You know, the submission to the festival circuit was, you know, a given and it's just like, you know, the game's done, here you go.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Fill out some forms.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:43.000
But now it's just breathed new life into this because there's so much of an interest with it and such positive response from the criticism world that we're, you know, we're able to do these opportunities.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Now, Deidre is currently a grad student at University of California Santa Cruz under the Center for Games and Playable Media and is focused doing that.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Wait, so on top of making this game, Deidre is a student.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Deidre finished this just before or just about starting grad school.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Okay. Wow.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
They'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but that's about the timeline.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So the game was done around the time if not before starting at Santa Cruz.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Wow.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:33.000
But now it's, you know, if I didn't come along, I'm not trying to sound self-important, but if I didn't come along or someone like me didn't come along for Deidre,

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I don't think we would be seeing this kind of release because it's a lot of work and, I mean, it's a lot of work for me and I know what I should be doing.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Tell me quickly here, I'm going to get to this in a minute here, we're actually going to give away a couple copies of the game just to find people that are listening and we'll get to that in a minute.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:06.000
But I want to know too first quickly, I don't have a whole lot of time left to say because he very agreeably agreed to do a last minute interview here tonight so I've got to kind of wrap up things quick.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
But if you guys have questions, live.vognetwork.com, you can always, you know, fire as well.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You guys are on Twitter, I'm sure you'd be happy to answer questions there or through the website and so forth.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I want to ask though real quick before we get to the giveaway and the pimpage and all that of where to get the game.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Music, obviously music is a big part of this game. What is some of the music like in the game?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Actually, I'm sorry we didn't prepare this, can you call up the website and play the trailer? It's less than a minute.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I think that would be a very good thing.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000
If I can remember how to spell it, oh wait no, luckily I have your Twitter, I have it in my history.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Guess who now has it on her iPad.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
That was quick.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Yay!

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Hey, you sold at least one.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Just the giant trailer here on the page?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Yeah, just play it, play it.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Alright, here you go. I'm going to play this here for you guys.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Pimple Mouse.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It's Pamplemousse.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Are you a boy or a girl?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
No, I'm a detective.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It's just a pile of mail, a bunch of bills I haven't paid.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I can't believe the lights still turn on in this place.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Casey Bingham? I've sort of heard of him, I think.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
He's a singer and he's like, you know, cute and stuff?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Uh, suffice to say, he can't be easily replaced.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:44.000
God, search the room, try to find something that'll tell me something about what's going on with Devon and this thing she's got with Casey Bingham.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
See it? That's the trailer.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.000
This is very, like, I mean this in a nice way. It's not going to sound nice, but it's very odd.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Yeah, it is odd. You know, like, good odd.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It's odd in that Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Animation Festival kind of way. Does that make sense?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Yeah. You know, I don't think it would be that kind of fitting there, but it's odd.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
It is a completely different experience from what it used to.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And, you know, we also have a demo of the game.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It's in Flash at our website too, so you can play that as well.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I know it's in Flash, but, you know, in browser demo.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
There you go. Yeah, exactly. You gotta embrace that however you can.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Quick question from RageNator in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I don't know if you know the answer to this because I know you didn't design, but I'm going to try you anyway.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
What was the motivation to have the game be a point-and-click game as opposed to be a platformer?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So maybe just, like, why, if you know, why did Deidre go point-and-click with it?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Well, I don't want to speak definitively. However, no.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:06.000
So Deidre is very active in the IF community, that's interactive fiction community.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Worked at Hothead for a while. Was an intern at Telltale. Actually, here's an interesting story.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Deidre was an intern at Telltale and done with the internship a month before I started at Telltale.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But we didn't meet until that year GDC.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So it's like two people who went to the same high school that never met each other till, like, after college.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Yes, exactly.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
That's funny.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So, of course, if Deidre was at Telltale, like, there's definitely that exposure, right?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Yeah.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
So, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:48.000
There's also a piece they did earlier that's also on Deidre's website, the link is towards the bottom,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:56.000
called Life Flashes By, which is another point-and-click adventure, 2D animation, not a musical.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
But that's completely free and available too, so that's available.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So it's definitely not anywhere outside of the realm of their development and experience.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Gotcha, gotcha.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Alright, well, Seg, we're gonna have to wrap up here, but I do want to allow folks an opportunity to check out Dominique Pumblemoose for themselves.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000
If you would like to, we're gonna do two contests here on the show to win some codes for the game, which is, these are Humble codes, right?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
These are Humble Bundle codes, which also include the Steam key with it.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Okay, so that ought to be accessible to everybody, unless you really wanted it on iPad.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
But if you want it on iPad, go get it on iPad, it's available right now, which Dark Soccer just did.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I did, and $5 is not a whole lot to pay for a good game.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Nope, not at all.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So, if you would like to get one for free, however, we're gonna give one away to our live folks and one away to our podcast folks.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:03.000
So if you would like to win a copy through the podcast, and this is only through the podcast listeners, send an email right now to participate at orangelaunceradio.com

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and just say somewhere in there, I want Dominique Pumblemoose!

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And we'll choose just one, we'll just do a good old random draw, and we'll let you know who won in two weeks when we're back with an all-new Orange Lawns Radio.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
For those of you that are live, I'm gonna see if you were paying attention.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And I'm gonna have you answer a little question.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
So here's the question, and you gotta answer it.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:29.000
How many awards, how many awards is Dominique Pumblemoose up for at the IGF Awards?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You can send your message over private message to Skye in the chatroom, S-K-I-E.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And first person to get that in there with the correct answer will win their very own Humble Key for Dominique Pumblemoose.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Now, Seg, before I let you go, please, commence the pimpage.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
How can people get more of this game? What's the website and all that good stuff?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
The website is DominiquePumblemoose.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000
If you make your best guess at Googling that, it will probably show up.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Just know that it's two words. And it will show up.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Actually, the thing is, even though our big release day is Tuesday, you can go to the website and just buy it from Humble right now.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Sneak peek, you guys! Early release exclusive for OLR listeners, wink wink nudge.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Oh, that's right! There's going to be Steam trading cards for Pumblemoose.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:36.000
And some unique emoticons. It's all the characters' faces as emoticons.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000
And there's a rare drop. There's two rare drops. One of which is the cartoon version of Deidre, their face.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And one is the cartoon face of yours truly.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Nice!

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So the whole Steam trading card thing is out there. I had to do that art too.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I've been doing all the support art and everything.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I don't sleep ever.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Oh, and one more thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have that many details because they haven't really published them out.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:25.000
But the IGF and GDC awards, they go back to back, literally in the same room, will be streamed on GameSpot.com this following Wednesday.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So not this week, but next week Wednesday.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And it will be streamed 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And you can see us waiting in the wings and seeing our fate for all the IGF and Game Choice awards that are right after.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Alright, well don't be too nervous when you have to go up there and accept some awards.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I imagine Deidre will be doing most of that.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Yeah, it's all Deidre.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
You get to stand behind Deidre and just, you know, thumbs up. Hey!

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That's the suit. Talk to me for business.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Alright, by the way, For the Fallen Dreams, our winner there in the chat room.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
For the Fallen Dreams with the correct answer of 4.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Like seriously, like one second ahead of ActDeft.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
And then we had some other people that submitted some incorrect answers. I'm sorry guys.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:29.000
But good attempt, good attempt. So I will get, I got For the Fallen Dreams' email and I will get you in touch with them so you can get that code on over.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And then if you didn't win tonight, if your name is not For the Fallen Dreams and you didn't win tonight, you do still have that opportunity through Participate at OrangeDawnTreaty.com.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
We will pull a random emailer in two weeks. So.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Cool.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Awesome. Segg, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. Best of luck.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Thank you. This really means a lot to me.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
It means a lot to me that you would come on this show.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.000
You know, the press is hard. And especially when you have to do everything else too.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Hey, I always say, indies gotta look out for each other.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And that's, I know I'm usually saying that in the context of indie podcasting, but that is so true about indie video gaming and the media as well.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
We gotta stick together. So I'm really glad we could help bring a little awareness towards such a title.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I'm not sure people would have heard of otherwise necessarily. So you know what? There you go.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:25.000
There you go. So, all right. Well, Segg, again, best of luck and take a nap this weekend. You earned it.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
After Tuesday, I'll be able to nap and then GDC happens. Oh, God.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
All right. All right, buddy. Take care. Thank you so much for being here. Have a...

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yep, you too.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
All right.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Goodbye, O.O.I.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Goodbye.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Bye.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
All right. Always wonderful to hear from Segg here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That was great. And especially for coming on at such last minute notice and giving a nice little interview there.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Dark Sakura gonna check out the game, let us know what she thinks.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Yeah, except I have to play it all at home because I can't take this to the land of cubes and tech.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Segg, by the way, is over in our chat room now if you had another question that you weren't able to get in over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Meanwhile, we've got some rapid fire news to jump into here as we get more into part B of our show.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Loki, how you doing? You ready for some news?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Sure.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Go for it.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Okay. So, Titanfall, this is coming out, of course, on Tuesday.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And they've already said, hey, you know, we understand that early copies do get out there and we're not gonna ban players because of that.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They're saying, you know, about playing early, we're not gonna stop you or ban legit copies.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
It's pre-launch so there may be interruptions in the service as we prep servers.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Also, the servers don't go live until 12.01 a.m. on the 11th in the local time.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:55.000
So, I don't know how much you're gonna be able to play an online game when the servers aren't online.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Yeah, it's not gonna do much good to get an early copy of a multiplayer game for which there's no servers.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Well, I don't know, the servers still might be up right now because I was like reading a GAF forum post earlier and there's some people capturing footage for multiplayer games and stuff.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So, maybe they are testing them still but, you know, definitely you're gonna get in trouble if you start streaming that stuff.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And then also, of course, you know, you can preload it on Origin if you want to do the PC version. It's 50 gigabytes. That's ridiculous.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
That is gigantic.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yeah. And then, of course, in GameStop fashion, you may well be aware that the PlayStation 4 cameras are pretty impossible to find.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Well, just like anything else that's hard to find at GameStop, they decided to go ahead and raise the retail price on that.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So, no longer will you find it for $59.99 but you can get it for now $69.99.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:03.000
So, that kind of is annoying. But I guess they're well within the right to do that. Of course, I'm also well within my right to not shop there.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah. You guys know I've really been trying to get a PlayStation 4 camera and I kind of gave up.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And although I'm like, yay, they're in stock again, this just pisses me off.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Like, why is GameStop the only store getting these just so they can turn around and fuck people by doing this? This is ridiculous.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I don't need a camera that bad. Like, Iamoverit.com. I am over it officially.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And then, last but not least, there's some pretty cool Humble Undles going on right now.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Of course, they have a weekly sale that features all these different PopCap games including, you know, for whatever amount you want,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Pagle Deluxe, Bejeweled 3, Bookworm Deluxe, Escape, Rose Cliff Island, and Feeding Frenzy 2 Deluxe.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
And if you pay $6 or more, you get Plants vs. Obvious Game of the Year Edition, Pagle Nights, and Zuma's Revenge.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So, that's a pretty good deal there. And all those unlock on Steam or Origin.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I did pick that up.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
You did?

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yeah, I did. Why not? Especially these old school PopCap games. I really like them and why not, you know?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And then, of course, if you're, you know, there's another one going on as well. Devolver Digital is doing a double debut bundle.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And that you can find at hummebundle.com slash devolver.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And this one's going towards the Brandon Boyer Cancer Treatment Relief.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And if you're not familiar with Brandon Boyer, he's the chairman of the Independent Games Festival and also the site Venus Patrol.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And, of course, he was diagnosed with cancer and he's currently trying to get some funding for his treatments.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So, going towards that, of course, they have a bundle. It's five games and five indie movies.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And with the games, they have Duke Nukem 3D, Megaton Edition, Shadow Warrior, Classic Redux.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Also, was it Defense Technica, Mark Echo's Getting Up, Contents Under Pressure, and Cosmic DJ.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:16.000
And then with that, the films Mars, Good Game, Austin High, The Poisoning, and One Couch at a Time.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
So, it's like some indie films and that kind of stuff.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And if you want to get everything, you know, it's ten bucks.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Otherwise, you get, you know, just Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior and that kind of stuff.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
So, check it out.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I also see some heartfelt comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, the Brandon Boyer story is sad.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Saig says, Brandon is the best person, which obviously Saig was just talking at length about a lot of this indie stuff.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Blackwolf says he got insurance, then got diagnosed with cancer, but it was before ACA went into effect.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And so, him just telling his doctor, yeah, I had a stomachache once that gave his insurance company the reason to say,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
pre-existing condition, pay for it yourself.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I guess this has already been looked into, but I thought that pre-existing actually had to come off of plans back in 2011.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Or earlier when they first signed the thing into law.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I think it was depending on state.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Yeah, that might have been it. It might have depended on state.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
That's really unfortunate.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Proof we had a broken system.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Yeah, I can't really comment further, but I'm glad to hear that the troops are rallying around them.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Alright, well, let's move on. I got some news here.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:34.000
So, we talked about the Humble Bundle a minute ago for PopCap, and speaking of PopCap releases,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Pagle 2 is on its way onto the Xbox 360.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I don't know if you guys know, but Pagle 2 has been out on Xbox One.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
But unlike other PopCap games, it hasn't shown up everywhere.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Well, that trend will finally break soon. It looks like Xbox 360 will be getting its version on May 7th.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:59.000
There you go. The game costs $12 on Xbox One. It's assumed that's the price on Xbox 360, but we don't know for sure yet.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Also, dual mode just launched in the Xbox One version for two players fighting locally over the title of Pagle Master.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
EA did not announce any other platforms, but they do say they will be bringing it pretty much everywhere.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It's just a matter of time.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
This is interesting that this game is actually getting made.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn. This has been rumored for weeks and weeks here on the program, but yeah.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
There is a sequel to Shaq-Fu coming. There's a whole little trailer out there for it.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Why?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Well, here's the thing. It may or may not actually happen because it's on IndieGoGo.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
To make the game happen, they will need $450,000.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Now, they're a little bit tongue-in-cheek about this. They're not actually claiming that Shaq-Fu was just an amazing thing.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But they are saying that Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn is what the original game should have been.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So there you go. There's a trailer up if you want to check that out.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
And just so you know, they've raised $69,000 in change so far.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.000
But they do have 42 days left, so there are still a ways in the goal. They're just over 10%.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000
But they do have 42 days left, so that's a lot of time to contribute to Shaq-Fu.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I was going to say, fear not though. They're flexible funding, so even if they don't raise that amount, they're going to get your money.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Yes, I noticed that was on IndieGoGo and not the other sites.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Alright, one other thing here. I did not even know that this was a thing, but apparently the internet has already embraced Goat Simulator.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Oh yes.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I need this. What is this?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Tell me about Goat Simulator, because I honestly don't know much about it.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
How do you goat?

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Let's see. Goat Simulator is a game that's by, I'm trying to remember the company now.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
But basically it started off as like a game jam within their studio.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And it was just like this thing, it was just really dumb that they made in Unreal Engine 3.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000
And they posted an internet video of it, and it just took off viral.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So yeah, it's Koffenstein Studios, they did, oh god I can't remember the name now.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's really happening y'all, it's really happening.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Goat Simulator will be released on April 1st. No fooling, even though that's, I know, appropriate, right?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Sadly only available on PC and no multiplayer functionality, but you know what?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
If it sells really well, I think anything is possible.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Ten dollars is the asking price.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
If you want to go pre-order the game, you can right now.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
The website is goat-simulator.com.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.000
You know, that's really bad because I read that at first as Goat Stimulator, and that's not a game I want to play.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
You know, I made that joke in the chatroom actually.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Oh did you?

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I said Goat Simulator and then said better than Goat Stimulator.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I think for the sake of the show, you should really check out the video.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Okay.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
The trailer that's on there.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
On their website?

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
On their website.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I want a goat.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Alright. Here we go.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I'm gonna play the goat game.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Another video, poor Jason.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Poor Jason.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Alright, here we go.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I'm gonna look at this trailer right now here for Goat Simulator, which I've never seen.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Oh my God.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
This is great.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I can't control the volume.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You're just flicking the goat everywhere.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Butts.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Butts.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I want to be a goat.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
More goat, please.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Oh my God.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000
You're bouncing a goat around on a trampoline through windows.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
This, this looks like...

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
This looks like a Loki dream game.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
It looks like a giant sandbox Grand Theft Auto thing, except the main character is a goat.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And you can lick stuff.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Alright, now I've seen everything.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
It's fantastic.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Jason said this music makes me feel like I'm drunk.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Oh God, alright.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
And Dungeon Buster says you play as a goat and can katamari things with your tongue.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000
But here's the best part though.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
They're trying to get Steam, was it Steam Workshop support for it.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Oh no.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
So everybody can put their own things in it.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Great.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Great.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Alright.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
This is gonna happen.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Alright, Dark Soccer.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
What do you got for us?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I have a couple things.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
First of all is going to be the release date for Watch Dogs.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
It's gonna be May 27th according to Ubisoft.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So they said that the Wii U version could be a few months after the game's release.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And then in other news, coming from Retro Studios as soon as it freaking works,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:46.000
is that they're actually saying we'll be lucky to someday return to Metroid.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.000
There was an interview with Michael Kelbal that said that they would really like to,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
and that they're developing a new game since they did the Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
and that they really, really want to do a Metroid game.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
The quote is, if the fans keep asking them, maybe we'll answer.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
That's it.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Alrighty, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
and we tackle it in the foogle question of the week.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Tonight's...

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I didn't let the music appropriately play.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Sorry, I was just in a hurry to tackle our question tonight.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Rob, let the music play.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Let the music play.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
He won't get away.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Alright.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
The foogle question of the week has to do with the sponsorship question we were asking earlier

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
between Penzoil and Mario Kart 8.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Now, not totally asking what you guys think about it,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
but we wanted to know what did you think would be an interesting sponsorship

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
or a promotional tie-in between a corporation and a video game.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So serious or funny, whatever you want to do there.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
So here we go. Here are some of the answers from Facebook.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Tech 2030 says, what about Boeing branded airships in Final Fantasy?

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Makes sense.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Asfer says, cooking mama, cooking with Paula Deen.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
The limited edition comes packaged with two sticks of butter, y'all.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
No.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000
As long as she sticks to, like, two or three canned lines, we're fine.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Awesome Unicorn says, I guess they missed the boat to cross-promote Bravely Default

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
by offering subprime lending with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
That's a good political joke. That's a good one.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I've worked in the mortgage industry when everything popped, so...

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Yeah.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Let's see.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Degenerate Johnny says, Depends sponsored underwear and Outlast would be the perfect partnership.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Players would not have to worry when they shit themselves during the jump scares.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
You nasty.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I love our listeners.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Let's see.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Our listeners are like listening to Tumblr without all the social justice.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
There's some really bad answers coming up here. You ready?

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
More. More.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Chiggers says, Mirror's Edge and Dramamine.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
That's a good one.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
That would be a good one.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Okay.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Our good pal, Shane Alinko.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Oh, Shane.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Warner Brothers could partner with the Red Cross for some fun Mortal Kombat tie-in.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
You know. No, no, no. Remember.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I think it was the Australian Red Cross?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Mm-hmm.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Teamed up with Konami for that whole Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 promotion.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
You know when the Saw movies come out.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
God, no, no, no, no.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
As much as I hate those movies, they do blood drives for that, too.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Because I've had friends that have done that.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
They should do is like Southwest Airlines in Mortal Kombat.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
You get over here and Southwest.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Get over here and donate.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Alright.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Let's go to some of the answers over on Google Plus.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Which, of course, you can find us at Google.com slash plus.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Orange Launch Radio. All one word.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Just a few.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.000
We didn't have quite the discussion blow up over there on Google Plus tonight.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I'm just going to read a couple of these here.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Retertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour and Viagra.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Some of them don't need it.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000
And lastly, Flaco Jones said,

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Since they sponsored the TV show, KFC should also sponsor the Walking Deads game.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Or the Walking Dead games.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.000
But only if they continue to juxtapose images of people eating their food with zombies eating people.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Tastes about the same.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Yeah, right.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Crunchy brain.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
It's probably made from the same material, too.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
SSG100 Matt says, Dope War sponsored by Dare.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yeah, I saw that one.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
That was pretty funny.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
The Double Down is made of people.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
People.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Charlton Heston presents.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Those were only some of the answers.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
You can read the rest over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Meanwhile, we've got more news for you.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Loki.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
What?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Act Defted. Have a good one.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
What?

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Kirby and Kirby vacuums.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Yes.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
You guys are going to end up reading them all anyway.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
All right.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
All right.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Unfortunately, there's been some layoffs at Sony Santa Monica.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Apparently, also along with that, a next gen game cancellation.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And basically, they said this is a result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas within SCE-WWS.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
We do not take these decisions lightly.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.000
However, sometimes it's necessary to make changes to better serve the future projects of our studio.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And we have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease the transition of those impacted.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000
And they haven't really said, I guess there was supposed to be an unannounced PS4 title in development.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:17.000
But they haven't really said what that was, although they kind of made another comment about it saying that there's not a single business on the planet where every single project that is started is a success.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And that's just what happens here.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Sometimes high profile projects or studios need a reboot.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And that's what happened here.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Santa Monica will always have a hugely important part of our global family of studios.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
It's a huge studio and that's right up there around 200 people even after the recent layoffs.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And of course, they're not saying which project we're going on.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But I guess they're rebooting everything.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Maybe they thought they needed like fresh blood, I guess.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I can see them maybe doing like a PlayStation 4 version of God of War or something.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Maybe it's just not testing well or something. I don't know.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:06.000
You know, SSG100 Matt in our chat room brings up a good point saying the Order 1886 was being done by Sony Santa Monica.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
So could that have been an impacted game?

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000
It seemed like it was far along from what we were seeing, but I hope it's not that one.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I had heard rumors, and you know, again, rumors take it with a huge salt lick.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000
But they had a game that was very similar to Destiny that was in the making.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And that unfortunately, Destiny was looking like a better game to make a long story extremely short.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And that was the cause.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
But again, that could have evolved from like a NeoGaf post from somebody's uncle or something.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
You know, I don't know. So take it with a huge grain of salt.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I just hope the Order 1886 is still something that's going to be happening because I like that it's a new IP.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000
It's a little bit different. I think a lot of people are here for the werewolf and steampunk type of thing.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I think it's still going to be one because remember, they just got done showing it off at like some Sony press event not too long ago.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So I think that's still coming. It's just maybe whatever else they haven't really announced yet that they're working on wasn't panning out.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:18.000
But they're not the only ones. Disney Interactive has also laid off 700 people and they're planning to scale back their annual game output.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Which is weird because their annual game output is like one or two games.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Well, don't they do a shit ton of mobile? You're thinking of like Disney Infinity and that stuff.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Isn't this like their mobile side that does like Where's My Water was one of their big games?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I know there's a ton of Disney games on iPhone.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Well, I think it's just the whole group. Maybe they are scaling back some of their internet mobile games and that kind of stuff.

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I don't know. Maybe some of the movie tie-in games are scaling back because I don't really know if they have like scheduled as far as animated features coming out this year.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That would make a lot of sense actually because sometimes those tie-in games too, they seem to work with other companies.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Like I think of the one that comes to mind is that there was that Tangled Temple Run game.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I don't think Disney did that themselves. I think they worked with the creators of Temple Run to make that.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Well, yeah, and they also licensed their stuff out like Phineas and Ferb. They had a game that was done by Majesco.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:36.000
There's been other like, you know, I want to say even some of the Cars games weren't necessarily done by Disney at one time.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.000
But, I mean, I'm sure we'll see a new Disney Infinity from them this year because I think we've run out of characters as of April.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
So I'm sure they're going to be announcing something about that soon.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:54.000
And then I don't really expect much more from them. Maybe a couple handheld games. That's about it.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Well, our thoughts go out to the impacted workers. I swear to God it's been like three weeks in a row we've been talking layoff stories.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So I don't know what gives. I thought things were ticking up for the game industry.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
But our thoughts are with those impacted and hoping you guys can land somewhere else.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Yeah.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Maybe Square Enix is hiring. That's the story I'm going to get into next. I don't know.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:20.000
But I know Square Enix is polling people right now to get fan feedback on Kingdom Hearts.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Kingdom Hearts polling the fans to see what platforms gamers are currently playing on and what genre people prefer.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Now here's something interesting.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Kingdom Hearts 3, it's been announced for PlayStation 4, it's been announced for Xbox One, hasn't been announced for Wii U.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So this news has been gaining a lot of traction on Nintendo websites to basically go hit the poll and say show Wii U some love.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Show them that there is fans out there that want to see Kingdom Hearts on Wii U.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So very interesting. I don't know. Again, it's just a poll. I don't know if it'll have that full impact.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:06.000
But it could be very interesting. I just don't think Kingdom Hearts 3, I mean if they're going for the look, it probably can't really be done on Wii U.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I hate to say it, but I think they're, you know, again, Wii U is built a little more on the 360 PlayStation 3 with a little more oomph.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:21.000
But I would think that if they know that there's a huge following for Kingdom Hearts on Nintendo, maybe there could be a side story or something.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
You know, and certainly there was Dream Drop Distance on a Nintendo platform.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
So it's not like Square Enix is going to say F you to all Nintendo platforms.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
So you never know what might happen with that. So good luck.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Alright, DarkSakura.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Well, I have some news. And this is actually going to be more something that I think we need to play for people.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.000
There is actually a video out for GamerX2, which is the convention you went to last year.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000
And I'm going to do my best to make it to this year.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And it has Ellen McLean, who was GLaDOS in Portal, and John Patrick Lowry, who was the sniper in Team Fortress 2, showing some love for the convention.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.000
And I honestly think that it's better just to let it play, but everyone should be supporting it.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
It's July 11th through 13th at the Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And play it.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Sure, there's just a couple minutes, so let's take a listen.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Who doesn't love the voices of Ellen McLean and John Patrick Lowry?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I mean, they could be reading the phone book, and I'd be excited.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Yes.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But this is much better than a phone book.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:39.000
In a world where gay gamers gather together to get their game on, gamble, gallop, and geek out to giddiness in a great gala of grandeur and glee.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Will you be the one to say them nay?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Will you be the one to crush their dreams?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Will you be the one to say,

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Oh gee, you don't get a party.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Oh gee, you don't deserve a party.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Oh gee, why don't you go home and cry in your pillow?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Oi, you poop on my party, I'll put a prime pinna on that pumpkinette of yours.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Hello.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Oh, have you gained a little weight since last we spoke?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Well, no matter.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
The Sniper and I are just having a quiet evening here at home.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
And we thought we'd say a few words in support of GamerX.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
It's happening this July in beautiful San Francisco.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
The city by the bay.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Now we certainly wouldn't want to get the impression that we're coercing you into supporting this wonderful gathering.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Perhaps you think it's a good idea.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Perhaps you don't.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Perhaps you're a forward-thinking progressive who feels that all human beings should be able to come together to celebrate themselves and their friends.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Or maybe you're a reactionary pig.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Either way, we don't want you to think that I would release large quantities of deadly neurotoxin if you don't give generously to GamerX.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Look into your hearts.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And please give generously.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Really generously.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I'd hate to get angry.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I love her.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000
If you haven't seen the actual YouTube, which you can see over on GamerX's YouTube channel, which is just G-A-Y-M-E-R-X.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Just getting to see the video of her doing that voice.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
With the cute face.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
She does such little cute faces and things. She's great.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Well, there is an ongoing Kickstarter that you can go to.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
And so far, well, as of the time of the announcement, there's 18 grand scheduled so far.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Nice. So they've hit their goal.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And basically they said that David Gator from BioWare, basically the dude who's writing Dragon Age, is going to be there.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
There's a bunch of people there.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
There's the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Just a bunch.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
And a wrestler, Darren Young.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.000
So Bobby Wrestling Chat is going to be there.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
And so lots of stuff is going on. I really want to go this year.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Cards Against Humanity, the huge AAA sponsor this year.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I really want to go.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Well, I will tell you this, too. On the podcast front, I'm a huge supporter of indie podcasters.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
And I do network on Facebook with a great group of independent podcasters.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Of course, great.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Hey, Loki, you all right over there?

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Yeah, sorry.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Breaking out the power tools.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
All right. Anyway, mid-show.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Just some of the other indie podcasts that are going to be there.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Obviously, Grandpa from Hoard House and the just announced T'Vog starboard power company.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
He is going for sure as well.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Some other great GLBT podcast.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
My buddies from Game Buoy.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
You know I love me.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Some Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
They're there as well.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Game Bar is going to have some representation.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I'm positive Jason's going back this year and maybe his co-host as well.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I don't know.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I know Koopa Club will be represented.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Those guys are going as well.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
One of the new kids on the block who has an amazing show.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Amazing.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Donnie Wahlberg?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Video.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
No, this is better than Donnie and Mark put together is video game realness.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I know they're trying really hard.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
They got to come all the way from Canada though.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
And it's cold up there, y'all.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
But check at least all those shows out.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
And yeah, hopefully some of them at GamerX too this year.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
And there hopefully will be another panel of some sort.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
That's in the planning as well.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
So, yeah.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
I want to go.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
You should go.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
If I can.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
All right.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Let's move on.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Some more news.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Where are we at now?

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Loki.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
All right.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
All right.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
So let's see.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Put away the parrot.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Parrot?

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
What parrot?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I can't believe that they're actually going to make this.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
But apparently The Last of Us is going to be a film now.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I mean the game was cinematic enough.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So I just thought they'd leave it at that.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:10.000
But yes, now they're going to be partnering with Scream Gems, Brian Dukes, and Eric Ling.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I guess they're saying that it's going to be written also by basically the team at Naughty Dog.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:28.000
So hopefully that means there'll be a faithful translation of the actual game into movie.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Because usually it's kind of not very good.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
No word, though, on when exactly this is expected to be released.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Probably not for a few years, I'm guessing, at this point.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Yeah, this has got to be really early on.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
So.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Codeman in our chat says, oh god, the story will be ruined, dammit.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Well, we'll see.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
We'll see.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.000
The good news is somebody's got to be the first great video game movie.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Maybe it'll be this one.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Maybe?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Mm-hmm.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Hey, this is a video game that maybe they'll turn this into a movie as well.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Because this is supposed to have some pretty kick butt writing behind it.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It's Quantum Break, which of course is one of the Xbox One exclusive games that we're sure to get a look at later this year.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:25.000
It's developed by the same guys who did Alan Wake, which was really underrated in some ways on the Xbox 360.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Great soundtrack and great game.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Very Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
It was really good.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
But anyway, those developers, they moved on and they're making Quantum Break.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Well, this is pretty cool.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
There's now an Oscar connection.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
You know, last week our show was up against the Oscars.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And I'm sure many of you have read about all the movies that won Oscars by this point.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
And one of those movies that won quite a few Oscars was Gravity.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Gravity didn't win the best picture prize.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
That was 12 Years a Slave.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
But Gravity did pick up a lot of technical awards and things of that sort.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Well, what's pretty cool is that some visual effects work in the game will be some of the talent that actually made Gravity that won a lot of those VFX Oscars.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
So that's really cool.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:15.000
They were congratulating Greg Luden on the Remedy Games website for the Oscar that he got for Gravity.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:22.000
And so, yeah, he worked with Gravity's computer-regenerated interiors with the free-floating space objects and so forth.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And now he's working on visual effects for Quantum Break and scripting and designing events as level design.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:38.000
So even though we may not have the first great video game that's been turned into a movie, we certainly are seeing movie elements going into video games.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I know I for one am very excited about Quantum Break.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.000
That's probably what's going to break me eventually and make me get an Xbox One.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
So I'm very excited about that.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
All right.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Let us get to the mailbag.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Every week you guys send us an email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we dive into the mailbag and read some of our favorite emails here on air.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And we get very mad at all those emails that you drown us in.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Grr, I hate reading.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Grr, I hate it.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I never learn to read.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I hate it when I play the wrong music bumper.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Let's try this instead.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
First email.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Dear OLR.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Dear emailer.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:37.000
In regards to the discussion last week regarding what video game movies will have to do in order to attain widespread critical recognition, it seems that production companies will have to take a serious look at what source material is chosen.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
That I agree with right away.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Scanning the Wikipedia list of films based on video games, the source material is almost universally fighting action or horror games.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:55.000
These are all types of movies that tend to perform well in the box office and fall short in the major awards season.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000
A problem also arises when considering games that are more story driven such as RPGs.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:07.000
While I would love to see any number of, let's say, Final Fantasy games adapted, the time constraints of a film would be incredibly difficult to overcome.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:19.000
So if big budget action titles, fighters, horror games, sprawling RPGs, and games with effectively no story such as your typical platformer are out, what video game industry darling does that leave us with?

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
That's right, bite-sized indie games.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
You had touched on this idea a bit mentioning Journey, but how about Papo & Yo?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000
After all, Pan's Labyrinth won three Oscars and was nominated for three more.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And To the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won one and was nominated for another. That's a good movie.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I know this has been as much to do with the quality of the finished product as it does with the content, but these are games that feature subjects and set pieces that have proven popular with Academy voters.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Additionally, if these smaller and more sophisticated stories managed more frequently to get the type of exposure this would bring, it could really stand to improve the reputation of gaming as a whole.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Because really, a Call of Duty or GTA movie isn't going to change anyone's mind about anything, no matter how stimulating it may be to watch.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Apologies for the lack of any real question beyond something like what indie games have enough story to make a movie, but I just wanted to give my two cents.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:22.000
So I will now look forward to the day when directors stop thinking that making a video game movie means throwing a dart at the top of a list of-

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
At the top of-

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And tongue tied means throwing a dart at a top ten list of best sellers and start thinking a little smaller and more personal. Until then, stay awesome.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And that's from Awesome Unicorn.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:41.000
For that great email, for what it's worth, however, I mean, there is that Minecraft movie and Minecraft did start as an indie game.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I mean, I realize it's grown like crazy, but, you know, there is that. And it sounds like they're approaching it the right way if it's going to be like the Lego movie was type of thing.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:00.000
But I do agree with the thought that we don't necessarily always have to think of big budget, like it's got to be like the hot selling games are the only things that are going to make good movies.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Because we do have good stories and lots of great video games that might make for a good movie.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:24.000
For the record, I have seen very quality acting coming from those, you know, action and whatever genre that, honestly, if these same actors had been in the indie film or other type of, you know, Oscar-y film, then they would have easily taken the prize. So, I'm just saying.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Tiger Claw, reminding us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com that, by the way, the Need for Speed movie comes out on March 14th. I know, because I saw Flaco's article on VOG.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
It said, who knows, it could actually be good considering the games never really had a story.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
It's going to be Fast and Furious, the new.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Exactly. It's just to hold the Fast and Furious crowd over while they figure out what they're going to do with the next movie.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Okay, next email. We have one more after this.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here. I just wanted to throw in my two cents on the whole Wii and DS Online plug-pull that's going to happen soon.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I used to be an employee of GameSpy, now acquired slash defunct, so I don't have to worry about telling you guys this stuff, which is actually the company that hosts all the matchmaking for every single Wii and DS Online titles.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Since you guys are near and dear to my heart, I'm giving you guys the exclusive scoop on this.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Out of all GameSpy titles that ever existed, including huge games like Borderlands, Mortal Kombat 9, GTA 5, etc., surprisingly the consistently highest traffic title is Mario Kart Wii.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Now GameSpy got acquired by Glu Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game company a year or so ago, which is around the time I left the company.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:42.000
So I heard their division isn't doing so well. High turnover, my old manager got pushed out for political reasons.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
He was a grade A d-bag. And Glu is probably losing money on that acquisition.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:16:00.000
So I'm guessing that what happened is Glu is trying to cut their losses on the acquisition by either charging a huge amount of money to Nintendo to keep their servers running, enough to justify keeping the engineers to keep the servers maintained at least.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Or they straight up wouldn't renew the contract so they could let those engineers go.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:14.000
So either Nintendo wouldn't renew for the higher price, or couldn't renew, and it doesn't make financial sense for them to port all their games to new servers they run in-house.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
That's why you're seeing Wii and DS titles go offline.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I hope this helps shed some light on the reason behind why Nintendo is shutting off their servers.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:29.000
They don't hate their fans, and they're probably not trying to drive everyone to just play 3DS and Wii U, though that's an added bonus.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
They just don't want to fork the money over to Glu or can't to keep the servers running on a new contract. Here's always AZHP.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Thank you for sharing that with us, and I hope you all were paying attention because I think that's it.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:53.000
And it's not just because there might be that insider's perspective or whatever. I think when it's stated like that, it makes a crap ton of sense.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Agreed.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
We're going to have to put a second gold star by his name.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Yep. You're our first double gold star recipient.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Our first double gold star recipient.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
One more email?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
One more email.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Hello. This is coming from, um, I'm just going to say Ronnie, because he didn't list a name.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Okay.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Hello. I have been a listener since the live 365 days, and I really enjoy the show. This is my first email, and I'm about to start college soon.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I was wondering what your advice on balancing video game time and college study time. Is there a good formula?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Um, I will say yes, there is.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Um, when it's at the start of the semester, you can probably get away with gaming a bit more.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
You just want to, the way that I do it when I have, because keep in mind, I was a, you know, a graphic design major.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000
I had a lot of projects, time intensive projects.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:55.000
And for me, um, I would at least make sure I had one day a week that was my completely not school related time.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.000
So that I could, um, just focus on other things, have fun, let my brain relax.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Because everyone needs that. If you keep studying all the time, you're going to burn yourself out.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
So that's what I say.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Have a night that's you.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Um, yeah, I, I'm not the best person to answer this question because I kind of didn't finish college.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000
And, you know, maybe it's because I didn't prioritize the right way.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000
But I'll tell you kind of some things I've learned in my adult life is that certainly there's, that you can make time for video games.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I think a lot of people go, oh, you'll never be more stressed out than you are in college.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.000
You'll never, I kind of don't think that's the case. I think your adult life stays just as busy as you are in college.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:40.000
It's just that you are so overwhelmed and it's so, you know, new, that whole experience that, you know, for me, I wasn't able to do it.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
But not everybody is.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
So if you want the best chance for success, I'm going to tell you what I do in my adult life.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000
And the best example is probably like the, the actually comes back to this show, OLR.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:56.000
There is a period of time when I wasn't really posting OLR to the podcast feed for like four days, five days.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I just kind of, I kind of did it whenever I fucking felt like it, you know, type of thing, which to be fair, it's a free show.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
And I have the right to do that.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.000
But at the same time, if I want to have the loyalty from the listeners, then I've got to be loyal to them.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000
If they're, if I expect that, you know, they're going to stay loyal to OLR, then I've got to be loyal and making sure the show gets up on time.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:24.000
So I had to make a promise to myself, no video games, no MMOs, no nothing until the show gets uploaded right away on Sunday nights.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Now, granted, if there's another priority, like, oh, you have to go get your partner from work or he'll be standing out in the cold all night.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Then yes, I'll do that first and then upload the show.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:42.000
But I think that's what you have to do, Ronnie, to really have that key for success is you really have to promise yourself, I'm not going to touch the games until I finish the work.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And either you're going to be able to do that or you're not.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000
You know, you could also have what my issue was.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
I have a very strong visual memory.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I couldn't study. I don't study.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000
If I don't pick it up the first time I read the information, I won't pick it up at all.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Or not even read it, but from my presentation in class.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000
I have to tie something that I am hearing with something I'm seeing.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.000
But once I do that, I don't have a problem.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I want to make one clarification because I'm reading the comments in chat, Ron.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
It made me realize that I left this big logic gap that people might infer something I'm saying.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000
So I just want to be very clear because I see Bobby in chat going, don't remind me.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.000
And I know a lot of other podcast producers do wait two or three days to put their content up.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
So I'm not saying that if you don't do it in a certain amount of time, you're not loyal to your listeners.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That's not what I'm trying to say. I want to make that very clear.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
You have to find what works for you.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:47.000
And what I'm trying to say is that if I don't do it right away, I will slack off until the time.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
It's all about self-motivation.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Exactly.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You have to do it the way you know you can do it.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Exactly.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
For me, it works best that I do it right away.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Like for me, I work better under a deadline.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:04.000
So I admit I'm kind of a last minute sort of person, but then I get like this really random burst of productivity.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.000
And I freaking take advantage of it when I have one of those bursts of productivity and I get everything done.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
And then I'm like, oh, crap, I don't have my deadlines anymore.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000
So I sort of lose track of my other stuff until once again, I'm under a deadline.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
So your own motivation.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Let me get some comments in chat because chat is lighting up on this topic as well.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Speaking of Bobby, Bobby said, I actually play more video games in college than I do now.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I had more free time because I didn't have as many responsibilities.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
I had classes and a part time job and that's it.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I didn't have to worry about bills and stuff.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000
So some say, you know, that's a very good perspective that it might get a little worse as you get older.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
But being an adult is cool.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I was in band in college.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Yeah.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000
So I did band, I did orchestra and I did jazz band.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So most of my time was taken up by music because I had those obligations.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000
SSJ 100 Matt says, I had roommates who were game designers.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000
They failed out because they played too many video games, ironically.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:07.000
And the other thing is that I actually, I think that I got more responsible with my education once I was a little older

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
and then started working full time and going to school almost full time.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Because, I mean, you remember how busy I was at the mortgage job and going to school and doing OLR on top of that.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000
So it's going to be fun trying to go back to school in the summer.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, man, we got ripped a couple of weeks ago for not posting on time.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
You know, and it's going to happen.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And I think the audience is going to forgive that mistakes are going to be made or heaven forbid you take a week off.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Like we're taking a week off next week.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
And I think most of our listeners are pretty understanding about that,

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
especially because we're trying to put out like a mini show or something to kind of bridge the gap a little bit.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
So, you know, I think the audience can kind of forgive a certain way.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:53.000
But if you don't have some type of like regularity, that's when you leave your audience open to go find something else to fill the void.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
That's the only danger.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000
But, you know, one or two weeks, you're not really risking going to lose a whole lot.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000
But if you consistently are all over the place, consistently inconsistent, you're not going to get that consistency out of your listeners either.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
That's just something I've learned over doing this for a long time.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I remember what else it was I was doing when I went to the University of South Alabama.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I drank a lot and then I moved out here and everything got better.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
So there's a little bit more to this email. OK.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I realize college is all about self-independence and actually learning on your own.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.000
But the few games they do enjoy are addictive and require a lot of time and effort, such as Civilization five, banished fallouts and Minecraft.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Plus, I want to keep up with the culture, especially as I listen to your show.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Should I give up on gaming cold turkey until I'm done with my semester or vacation?

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Or did you manage to perfect a good balance with study time that I can adopt?

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I have seen some people go as far as snapping their game discs.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
However, I think this is stupid and my games are all on Steam anyway. Thanks.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And I guess we answered that question.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Yeah, I guess we kind of ended up answering it. You have to do what works for you.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I think the snapping the game disc, that's a little much.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.000
That's a little extreme and tabloid.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I don't think you should have to go that far. But I mean, maybe, maybe you put your I mean, again, you said it's all on Steam, so it's not going to batter.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:19.000
But maybe you take the person you trust most in the world, your best friend, your significant other, your your mother, father, take the person you trust most in the world.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Give them your Steam password and say, change it and then give it back to me when X, Y, Z is done.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
You know, it might come to that point where essentially you have to give the keys to somebody else, right?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Yeah, but I think you should have a little bit more faith in yourself.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And I agree that you have to gauge yourself.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:41.000
You know, like, you know, every I'll admit there are some times I skipped class to go watch Sailor Moon.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I'll admit or my thing at the time was actually running warriors because that was freaking cool.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:53.000
But, you know, would stay up until two in the morning playing to Shinden because I had class at 10 the next day.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Right. You know, but that's part of the experience is, you know, if you're going to do your gaming, perhaps do something more multiplayer.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Use it as a social moment and then use it when you're done with your regular studies.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
You know, and even with your study, allot yourself time.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Study in bursts of 20 minutes, take five minute break, another 20 minutes, five minute break.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
But don't overload yourself with your study.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.000
You will burn out.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:24.000
It's all balance. You can't give up your fun for the sake of your responsibility.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000
But at the same time, you can't let your responsibility eat you.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.000
So say bye. And yes, I played a lot of to Shinden when I was just in college, because that was 1994.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:40.000
My roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation. No, 1995, got a PlayStation.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.000
My good friend had a Japanese Sega Saturn, so I would spend a lot of time over his dorm playing that, too.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.000
So, yeah, I did a lot of gaming in college the first time.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
That's it.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.000
All right. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have an email to send us for a future week.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000
In the meantime, now I can play the angry music.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Now I can get to that because it's time for the FUs of the week.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Here is punishment.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
This is fucked up.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:24.000
A few goes to my bizarre allergies, because I've been kind of straying a little bit from my healthy eating style.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:32.000
And I found really tasty, low carb, whole wheat tortillas and my allergies starting to act up again.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
So it's clearly something going on with wheat.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.000
And I've had weird, you know, I had that really bizarre rash the other week.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:48.000
So I have to cut back out all the wheat again and getting back on the straight and narrow until I go to Disneyland for my birthday.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000
So, yeah, fuck wheat.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Loki.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.000
After the people that go into the self-checkout line and don't know how to use the self-checkout line,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I waited in line for about like 5-10 minutes for someone checking out one thing.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It's like I was out of there in 30 seconds, but I don't know why these people stand there kind of staring at the screen not knowing what to do.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I'm just going to give an FU to the stress of moving.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:31.000
And the fact, I'm going to, I'll say this, I'm going to give an FU to the fact that I know that people dig through the garbage here at my apartment complex as they do at most apartment complexes.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And part of why I'm excited to move into a house is that, yay, I can put the garbage out right when they come to pick it up and all that stuff.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
So that's exciting.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000
But the thing that like really pisses me off is that, like, I've got all this mail and the shredders kind of dead.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
So it's like, and I don't want to throw it away because people go through the garbage.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000
So it's like, I've got my shredder works. Does it? I've got a lot.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
But it's okay. You can bring it over and use my shredder.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:01.000
We've been talking about, uh, just maybe taking a big bulk thing over to like Staples or one of those stores that, you know, office stores that does the shredding, but it's just irritating.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I can also talk to Dan and see if you can use a secure shred at, that's an option.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You never know. You never know. Anyway, so, all right.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Um, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
And we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
But first, let's get to Loki.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Yes, so everybody's favorite space simulation game is now teaming up with NASA.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Kerbel Space Program is teaming up with NASA to actually do, what is it, an asteroid redirect mission.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.000
And it's supposed to be based off of real NASA data.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:49.000
And that they're, I don't know, I guess maybe allowing people to kind of try to come up with their own ideas.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Basically, Kerbel Space Program is giving the gamers a chance to dream big even if they're not astrophysicists.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:07.000
The relationship with NASA, the very beacon of big dreams and imagination is going to give players a real opportunity to learn about the universe we're living in.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:16.000
And I guess, you know, what this mission entails is attempting to land astronauts on an asteroid orbiting between our moon.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:26.000
So, I'm guessing, or beyond our moon, so I'm guessing that, are we looking at like a Armageddon type situation here?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Are we going to land on the asteroid and blow it up or something like that? I mean, is that what we're doing here?

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Either way, it looks like it'll be fun.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.000
That sounds awesome. I like it when real life kind of meets video games like that.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Have you played this Kerbel Space Program at all? Because I know I really haven't.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I haven't. I kind of wanted, though.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Yeah?

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I mean, it looks good. I'll wait for it until it goes on sale.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Awesome. I think it was in a Humble Bundle recently, though. I don't know if it's going to get much cheaper than that.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
No, it wasn't. You're thinking Starbound.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Yeah, if it was in Humble Bundle, I would have remembered that.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Maybe it was in one of the other indie bundles, because I swear I got that game through one of those.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
But anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And this is actually pretty sad, and I don't like to end shows on sad notes, but it is what it is.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I've got a report that Jeff Edwards passed away this past week at the age of 83.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.000
He died on March 5th, 2014, in Santa Monica, California.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Probably best known for hosting game shows. He hosted Jackpot and Treasure Hunt.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And, of course, why would I bring him up on a video game podcast, Dark Sakura?

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.000
What else did he host that we all know? If you grew up in the 80s.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
What? No.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Oh, I thought you knew.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
No, I didn't.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Loki, do you know?

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Nope.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:56.000
I know his name, so I'm trying to run through my head.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Starrcade.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Starrcade, oh my god, yeah.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:05.000
The granddaddy of playing the video game shows there in the early 80s.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Sorry to put you on the spot, Jamie. I thought you knew. I thought that's why you went off.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Thanks, Rob.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Sorry.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:15.000
But, yeah, obviously a very well-known game show host just from that and so forth.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
So, yeah, really sad to hear that.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I mean, he was 83, but still, you know, these are never any fun to report on.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.000
So, tip one back for the man that gave away arcade machines.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Actually, I saw an episode on YouTube. They are all on YouTube.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.000
There's, like, people that have archived, like, every single episode on YouTube.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Nice.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
They gave away a fucking Tron machine in a couple episodes.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
What?

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Little jerk kids that won the Tron machine.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Yeah, I bet they don't even have it anymore. Jerks.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
All right. We are going to go to the Skype line right now.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Dartetsuya says, I was surprised that he was that old when he started.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Yeah, he kind of – because if you think about it, you know, that show was back in the 80s.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
That was, what, like 30 years ago.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
He was in his 50s when that show was on.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.000
So, hey, there's still hope for me to host a game show someday, right?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
We need to get you a sparkly jacket.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I have a sparkly jacket.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Well, of course you do, Rocky.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
When were you Columbia?

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Birdcage Cinemas, late 90s, early 2000s.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
You seriously were Columbia?

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I did Columbia one time, but I wore somebody else's.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I wore Jessica's jacket or somebody else's back in the – from those days.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'm just trying to picture you as Columbia.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Well, I was walking down the street just to have an opinion.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Okay. I guess if I could do Dr. Scott, you can do Columbia.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Do you want me to tap dance right now for you?

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000
No.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Quick, somebody call. Are you going to get tap danced?

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
You can make the squeal noise.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Mm-hmm.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Eddie!

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Eddie!

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Sadly, there's people listening to this show that have never seen the Rocky Horror Pictures show.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
That's your homework assignment, everybody.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Poor children.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Watch it and make sure you have friends with you who have seen it

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.000
so that you at least won't get caught out as a virgin at the real show.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
All right. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
because we do have a caller on the line.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
This is Raging Aider.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Hey, Raging Aider. Nice to see you. What's up?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Nice to see you, too.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:19.000
How long since you had Justin TV?

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Justin TV. When were those days?

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
That was like the mid-300s with those episodes.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Those were the other house.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000
That was two studios ago.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Yes.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
It was a while ago.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Yeah, it's been a while.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:40.000
But anyway, a couple really quick random questions.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
You know, DarkSakura already knows that I mentioned this to her

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
on Steam's chat, I think, yesterday.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I just signed up for Origin yesterday.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Now, probably one of the first games I'm probably going to plan on buying on there

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.000
would be Mass Effect 3.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Do it.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:08.000
A worthy choice.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Now, I know you guys are big fans of the series.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
No, us? Loki hates it, for what it's worth.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Get all the games if you don't have them.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000
You can't just start on three.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I'm just starting to really get into the series myself,

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
and I just barely started playing the first game,

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:37.000
and actually I haven't played the third one yet, but that's precisely the point.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Now, the question is, how is the multiplayer on Mass Effect 3?

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Is it any good?

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
What's the best part of the game?

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
It's really good, Rage Nator,

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.000
and the reason why is because they focused on co-op instead of competitive.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000
In fact, there is no competitive multiplayer in Mass Effect 3,

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.000
which I can see where some people might see that as a bummer, which is fine.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Maybe that'll be in the next Mass Effect game, but it is all co-op,

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
and essentially what it is is that it's four of you defending a base.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
You defend a base against ten waves of aliens.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And different missions for each wave, too.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Yes, waves three, six, and ten have special missions,

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.000
and that might be like, hold this point, or escort this drone.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Or carry this item, so you can't run while you're carrying it.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.000
So you have to cooperate, and that's why I think the multiplayer attracts people

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.000
like myself and Dark Soccer, who don't usually play shooter-type multiplayer,

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000
is because it fosters an environment of helping people.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And the people that are going to be like, man, you suck, and duh-duh-duh-duh-duh,

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
they don't usually play on beginner anyway.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
They don't play on the bronze matches. They're all in gold and platinum.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
The bronze matches are more fun anyway.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000
You just sort of fuck around from time to time.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000
And if somebody's being that big of an asshat, then you leave and they're fucked.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000
We've done silver matches anyway, and it was pretty fun.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Remember that one time we tried a platinum match,

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
and we almost made it through one wave?

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Yeah, I know. Platinum matches are pretty scary.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
But yeah, there's a lot to that.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Here's my only concern, Reginator. Here's my concern.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:07.000
I'm going to be real with you because you're getting into Mass Effect 3 a little late in the game.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.000
I worry because EA has this tendency when they got a new game coming out,

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
they're going to yank the servers on the old game.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I think you've got at least a good year left because this is all the Mass Effect we have right now.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Until they announce Mass Effect Next, I can't call it Mass Effect 4

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
because they say it's going to be something else,

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.000
but until we know what Mass Effect Next really is,

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
then I can't really sit here one way or the other and say, you know,

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
when these multiplayer servers are going to go down.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
So I think you've got a good year left.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000
How about, though, we set a night that we run you through the ropes of multiplayer some night?

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000
You're very kind. For me, it's going to have to be a couple weeks because I'm moving,

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
so I can't volunteer for that.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I gave you my origin. I don't care who knows it. It's Kuro Tsubasa, like my Tumblr.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
But I bet you will find some other VoG people that will help you out.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Maybe you guys can convince Bobby Black Wolf to finally use his copy.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Yeah, Bobby. Play with us.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Actually, I did send out four or five invites already.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
One person already accepted. I was just waiting for the rest of the people to log in.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I haven't signed into Origin in like five months, so if I'm one of them, I'll get around to it eventually.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
I didn't sign into Origin for a little while,

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:27.000
and I'm actually, while I'm trying to finish my 17th...

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Actually, no, I'm on my 18th playthrough of Mass Effect 3 right now.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And when I finish that one, then I'm going to be going to Dragon Age 2 to give it another good run-through again.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Yeah, I kind of think of it. I saw Dragon Age listed on their online store,

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:51.000
and I don't know a whole lot about that series.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Above and beyond, maybe one or two trailers that I may have seen on PlayStation Network.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:03.000
But would you say that Dragon Age is a good series to play if you like role-playing games?

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I love Dragon Age 2. It's a lot more combat-oriented, but there's plenty of good role-play elements in it.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I couldn't get into it the way that Alan really got into it, and Shane, one of my best friends, is really into it.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I couldn't get into it the way they did.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Maybe, you know what though, but again, Mass Effect was a game I tried,

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.000
and I just didn't get back to it until years later, and I was like,

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
this is the best thing ever. So I think I just need to go back and try Dragon Age again.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I kept starting the first Dragon Age and kept stopping it,

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.000
and then I just picked up Dragon Age 2 and just played and played the crap out of it,

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
and then got to this one part that I couldn't beat,

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
because I was a stupid idiot and brought Fenris into this one dream level.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Fenris, by the way, is awesome, and you want to have them on your good side.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000
But then I went back and played through on PC.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I started having these problems with my hand, and I've beaten the game on PC,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
and I'm actually going to be kind of skipping the first Dragon Age again and going back to Dragon Age 2.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Ragenator, I feel like in some ways we've seen you groan as a gamer as you've been listening to OLR.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I know you've been listening for a while now, but I remember when you first would call this show,

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.000
you'd be talking about Nintendo 64 games and stuff that was really classics,

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000
and now you're getting up to games from like last year, so I'm impressed, Ragenator.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Yeah, honestly, you know, as weird as this sounds,

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:32.000
my PlayStation 3 being stolen a year and a half ago is actually a good thing in a sense.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but before my PlayStation 3 was stolen,

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.000
I would never in a million years consider PC gaming.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Now that it's gone, I kind of like begrudgingly signed up for Steam.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.000
And now it's a whole new world! There you go.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
All right, well, Ragenator, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.000
but have fun on Origin, and I will try to jump in the game and kill some of the Reapers.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
You'll learn why we call it LoLirgin.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
All right. Bye, buddy. Take care.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Yep, you too. Take care.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000
All right, that was Ragenator on our Skype line at 1877 Game OLR,

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000
or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
and BobbyBlackWolf in chat saying,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I haven't opened Origin in a year. It was SimCity.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000
And apparently BobbyBlackWolf and Shane having a discussion about

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000
that they can't like the same things, apparently,

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
which is why Bobby doesn't like Mass Effect.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
They're playing Final Fantasy XIV.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Yeah, very good point.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Oh, actually, what Shane just said.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Yeah, Shane just said that in the chat.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
But, to be fair, Shane, Bobby always makes fun of Endgame,

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
which is all you sign in to do.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I need to fucking catch up.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
I just hit level 34.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I feel like I'm being so slow.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Oh, that's all right.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I took my time with WoW, too.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
You know what, though? The converse of that?

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Oh, by the way, again, the Skype line is open at 1877 Game OLR,

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.000
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
The converse of that, DarkSakura,

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
is that when you burn through the content too fast, like where I'm at,

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.000
I only sign in to raid, and then outside of that, I'm like,

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000
what else am I going to do?

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Should I level another class?

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Eh, I'm over it.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.000
I'm going to go play Diablo.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Yeah, I mean, but I also started another character

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
so I could play with Junami.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Oh, nice.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000
On the work server.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Shane's been really trying to get me to go back to Final Fantasy XI,

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
which apparently they've made all these quality of life changes.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
You can just zip through a lot of the content

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.000
you used to have to find parties for and all this stuff, so.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Well, the only change they need to make is make it go free to play.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Right? That's the one change they need to make,

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
and I'll be on Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
You hear that, Shane?

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Make it free to play, and you got it.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000
I'm back.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
But I don't know, it's Square Enix.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Do you see Square Enix doing a free-to-play MMO like that?

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
I mean, I guess they have free-to-play mobile games.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Some of them are free.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
They'll monetize the crap out of it, though.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000
They'll have you buying Gil and all sorts of garbage like that.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Yeah, some of them are pretty awful.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Well, you know, and I talk about this with World of Warcraft,

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
is that I always say that Blizzard should just give the vanilla game away

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:06.000
and then sell the expansions, and as far as Final Fantasy XI goes,

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I think they could do that there as well,

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000
is that they could give away the vanilla game

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000
and then just sell the expansions or something like that.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Let's see.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000
I have a problem that if I get to Endgame in XIV,

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000
I'm going to get bored again and then go back to Space Goats

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
when it comes out for a while.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Dan's like, no, but I don't know.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Unfortunately, the listeners are not able to hear my voice right now

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
because our server went down.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000
It's not us.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Unfortunately.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Yeah.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000
No.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.000
So I can put a call out for calls, but we're not going to get any.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:47.000
So I guess I can go to Twitter at this point.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Hopefully we'll get through at some point.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
God, that pisses me off.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I get pissed off too.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I've about had it with this hosting server.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:56.000
So have I.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
We need to tell them to best TFU.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.000
It's getting a little ridiculous,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000
and I think we've given them the stern email before

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000
that they are not to do reboots on our server on Sunday night,

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
and yet here we are.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000
So something's going to happen with that.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
They're going to lose some business.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Meanwhile, I'm going to our Twitter,

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000
and SG100Matt tweeted us a story about Jeff Edwards,

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000
so a lot of people thinking about Jeff Edwards.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Our friend Marin Marvel, Tiara, tweeted and said,

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000
OLR is going up against Neil T. Sun.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000
What is that?

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
And Cosmos right now.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Oh, because Cosmos is back with...

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Neil Tyson.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Yeah.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:40.000
And says, sorry, guys.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Got to get my science nerd on.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
This is why we podcast the show.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000
I can forgive.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.000
We're back, by the way.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.000
I can forgive.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Oh, good.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000
We're back.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
You guys missed my little rant where I've basically said,

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000
as far as this server host of ours goes,

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000
I have had it officially.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Yeah, we've reconnected.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000
We're streaming.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000
We're good.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
We're good.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Although, honestly, I'm going to go back

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000
and download the torrent of Cosmos so I can watch it,

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:09.000
because, man, I grew up with Carl Sagan and Cosmos, you know?

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
And what was that show that had that old guy

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
that would walk on, like, a path of stars

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
or something in outer space?

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Do you remember that show, Rob?

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I don't.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
It was like this astronomy show.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Mm-mm.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
The fuck show was that?

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Oh, my God, because I used to watch that show.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I'm like, oh, my God, he's in space.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
And then I got older, but I kept watching it.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.000
It was a really good show.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
God, help me, chat room.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
I don't remember what this show was, and I'm old.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000
In response to last week's show,

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Picuruno said, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a great game, no joke,

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.000
and I did get both zombie DLC packs for Train Simulator.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
They actually have a story.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Act deft on a couple things from last week.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
My Little Pony, Fighting is Magic tribute edition

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
is released by fans.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Note, this is not done by main six, the original devs.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Oh, maybe that was a story for last week's show,

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
or maybe that was submitted for this week.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I don't know anymore.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000
It says six days.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
So, put out one more call for calls.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:11.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000
But I wouldn't be surprised at all if our little upsy and downsies

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.000
with the server.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I want someone to remind me what the fuck that show was,

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:19.000
because it's really pissing me off now.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Describe it one more time.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
It had, like, some old guy, not old, but, you know,

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:29.000
silver-haired guy, kind of, not portly, but kind of...

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Fluffy.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Fluffy.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000
And, oh my God, no, it wasn't Harry Caray, Space the Infinite Frontier.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:40.000
And he would wear, like, these sweaters with his collar poking out

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
and would just, like, talk about space.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
It was an astronomy show.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.000
No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard?

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.000
No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Mr. Wizard wasn't Fluffy either.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:48.000
It wasn't Mr. Wizard.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
You know Mr. Wizard hated kids.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Yes, I heard that.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:54.000
That's got to be an underground legend thing, though.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
But he'd, like, walk up into space and everything

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
on, like, his trail of stars.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Now I don't freaking remember what it was called.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
That was an awesome show.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
All right.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000
I'll put one more call out.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight?

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I haven't called on you yet.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I do, actually.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:17.000
There's going to be an update to Just Cause 2 multiplayer,

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
and you remember that mod?

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.000
It allows you to play, like, thousands of people online at one time.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Well, they've added a few things.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Earthquakes, real-time vehicle color changing.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
You can teleport.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Gibs on death.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.000
You can also do a Back to the Future-style car teleportation.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Hats, heat-seeking missiles, and cars that drive in the water.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Plus, you can also blend objects together,

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000
so they have a picture of an airplane combined with a whale.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Good stuff.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.000
All right.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
I had a call, and then they hung up, so,

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:55.000
because I had them on hold while Loki was finishing that thought.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Darsakha, you found your show?

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Yes, it was Stargazers, with Jack Fulley, Horkmimer.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I'm double-checking that this is him,

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
but the show used to be called Star Hustler.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:12.000
So, that was our buddy, VX JasonXV, who Google-food that for you.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I found it, but then I went back and saw that he did it.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Okay.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Star Hustler sounds like an awesome sci-fi series.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.000
It does.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000
And there's not a picture of him.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Crap.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
But it was a cool show.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
He died in, oh, he died in Florida in 2010.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Oh, sad.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
What a sad ending to that story.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Any other last-minute stories, Loki,

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:37.000
while we wait to see if somebody calls back, or?

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000
That was it.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.000
That was it.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
It was him, and that was the show.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Oh, my God.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
No, I didn't have anything else.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.000
All right.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Well, it is after 9 o'clock, so I guess I'm going to go ahead

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.000
and shut down the Skype line and wrap things up for the night.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Sorry to those that didn't get through,

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
but if you want to email us, participate.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000
At orangelandtrader.com is the place to send those emails.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Once again, we will not be back next week.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:04.000
We'll have something taped, so podcast listeners,

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
nothing will actually change for you except a plan

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
that the show will be a little shorter next week.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Live folks, you will hear that show debut Sunday night here

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
on the network, and then Starboard Power Coupling

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:18.000
in their preview spot right after us next Sunday,

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.000
and then we'll be back live in two weeks.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Everybody, please cross your fingers and toes for me.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I need all the happy thoughts I can.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Not only did the move goes well, but the internet works very well

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
in the new place, and we're able to get everything set up.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Because if not, fuck you, Comcast.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Yeah, because if not, I don't know what's going to happen.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I just want to warn people there's the possibility.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
We'll be in my living room.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Yeah, there's a possibility if things go wrong,

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
we could be gone for more than a week.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.000
So I just want to prepare everybody for that, but trust us.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.000
We will do all that we can to be back ASAP.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:56.000
That's just my disclaimer in my whole I love you guys.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Tune in and listen to every minute of every show.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
So trust me, we will be back ASAP just in case.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Meanwhile, that is it.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
It's about time to wrap up another week of the show.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
You know what? You said meanwhile,

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
and it made me think of Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.000
And Becky and I passed the Hall of Justice.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:16.000
The Hall of Justice.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
The Hall of Justice.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:18.000
In Susanville?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Not in Susanville, but up in one of those little small towns.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
And we wanted to go back and take a picture of it.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Nice.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
But we also passed a red phone booth.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:27.000
That's awesome.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Like an old school red phone booth.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Nice.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.000
That's cool.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:32.000
All right.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Thank you guys as always for tuning in every week and supporting our show.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.000
We appreciate it.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
You know, all we say, just if you like the show, help spread the word.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Leave a nice review on iTunes.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Stitcher's really great too.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
We need more good reviews there.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Also, tell a friend or two or five or 50 about the show and help us spread the word.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:53.000
That is all we ask.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000
And spread the word about all independent broadcasting and all the great hardworking.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I just gave a shout out to like five other podcast buddies of mine.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.000
I know there's a lot of other hardworking people out there at the Voice of Geeks Network

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.000
and other networks out there and just everybody that works hard.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Also, eat your vegetables.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Because I believe in your health.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Loki, I really hope that we're able to see you in a couple weeks.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000
But if not, I understand.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
We'll do the Skype thing a little longer.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000
But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.000
More people need to play on the Minecraft server, including me.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Including me?

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000
I've been very failing in getting on there.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:31.000
I'll try to log in tomorrow.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Yeah.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:33.000
All right.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:38.000
My final thought for tonight is I at least hope the internet holds up better at the new place.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.000
And Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Here's my new catchphrase.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Question everything.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Hmm.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000
All right.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.000
That's going to do it.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
We will see you next time from our brand new studio in two weeks.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Until then, good night.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:24.000
See you next week.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Bye.
