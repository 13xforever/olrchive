14000	20000	This week, one cloud gaming service attempts to make a comeback using your existing library of games, and another adds more devices to be able to stream from.
20000	25000	Not to be outdone, the UyU wants you to play their games everywhere, with plans to become a service over the course of 2014.
25000	27000	All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 543 for this March 9th of 2014.
43000	50000	And we're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, with you guys in our chat room,
50000	59000	live at the voicegeeksnetwork.com, where we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
59000	69000	And here in studio, of course, my name is Rob Roberts, and with me by my side, as she always is, unless she runs off to Disneyland or something, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69000	73000	Because I got fussed out last week. Sup bitches?
73000	74000	Sup?
74000	75000	Sup?
75000	76000	Sup, how you doing?
76000	77000	I'm tired.
77000	79000	You're tired? Try not to fall asleep during the show.
79000	82000	No, I'm not, I'm just sort of, I feel off kilter because of the time.
82000	84000	I know it's a three hour show.
84000	89000	The day is weird, and it's weird outside, and weird all the things.
89000	92000	Daylight savings time is quite the evil holiday, isn't it?
92000	94000	Holiday? I don't celebrate it.
94000	99000	I don't know. Here's why I call it a holiday, because they put it on a calendar.
99000	102000	And so, you know, it's in the holiday section of the calendar.
102000	103000	It's a warning.
103000	104000	It's a fuck.
104000	107000	You're going to have a bad Sunday because of daylight savings time.
107000	108000	Daylight savings time.
108000	111000	Well, you know, I was suggesting on Twitter, I said, let's just get rid of it.
111000	115000	Like, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are saying, but I actually have some friends that are like, no, no, no, no, no.
115000	118000	I need the extra hour of daylight. Like, that's a great thing.
118000	123000	So, okay, fine. Can we just have this be the last time in our lives that we lose an hour of sleep?
123000	124000	We're done.
124000	131000	I'll give up the rolling it back and the whole good daylight savings time that comes in the fall, and then we'll never have to lose an hour of sleep.
131000	134000	Is that the daylight giving time or something?
134000	136000	Daylight murder time because you're not saving it?
136000	138000	Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know.
138000	145000	I'm just, I just, I had a weird day yesterday too, so going out to the BFECA.
145000	151000	I heard, and if you don't mind me giving away all the details of your personal life here on air, I heard that you went out to Susanville, California.
151000	152000	Now.
152000	156000	Janesville, Susanville, some other dinky little place.
156000	160000	Here's the thing. Most of you out there listening have probably never heard of Susanville, and there's a reason for that.
160000	161000	It's teeny.
162000	169000	Well, and when you think of California, you think of places like the beach. You might even think about the snow, like Lake Tahoe.
169000	179000	You might think about politics like Sacramento where we're from, but you don't usually think about the middle of the goddamn nowhere forest like Susanville, right?
179000	188000	Well, this was up like, we actually did like a whole route. Okay, my best friend has a job that required her to go out and look at some places up around there.
188000	195000	And rather than have her go by herself, I decided to be a good friend, and I said I would go help her out. She fed me, so it was great.
195000	198000	So, and hanging out with Becky all day is really fun.
198000	199000	Right.
199000	200000	So, we went.
200000	203000	I would hang out all day with Becky. I hope you guys invite me next time.
203000	204000	Sure.
204000	210000	I can make, I've been to Susanville before. I hung out at the bowling alley like a true Susanville person would.
210000	216000	Well, we, it wasn't just Susanville we went to. We went to Janesville, which is even smaller, or Jamestown or whatever.
216000	224000	And this is going through like the really boring part of California. You go in past Truckee, past Reno, because you have to cut through Nevada to get up there.
224000	230000	And then you're just sort of like in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden you drive a little bit on, I think we're on 38.
230000	235000	And then you're in a forest. You're in a national forest. We went to Lake Almonor.
235000	244000	So, we circled back around to Lake Almonor, eventually getting to the Plumas National Forest and Portola.
244000	252000	And then all of a sudden we're back out of the woods. And we were like in the scenic woods with winding passages and babbling brooks and shit.
252000	259000	And fucking deer. Okay. There's pictures of the mule deer just hanging out in some guy's front yard.
259000	261000	I took a picture of him. It's on my Tumblr.
261000	266000	Here's the thing. As much, as much shit as we're giving Susanville and all this stuff, it actually is really pretty out there.
266000	270000	It's super pretty. It's super pretty. And you know, I have to say.
270000	271000	And fucking deer.
271000	276000	And fucking deer. I know. But I have to say that I really enjoyed the scenery.
276000	278000	I mean, I got to see parts of California I've never seen before.
278000	281000	I just don't want to do it for 16 hours again.
281000	284000	Because I woke up this morning and I was in pain.
284000	290000	I was like, my back was like, bitch you sat on me for like so many hours.
290000	296000	Let me ask this because it is a video game podcast. Did you get to do any like 3DS gaming or Vita?
296000	299000	I played some Animal Crossing and didn't tag anybody.
299000	304000	Nobody. Well, I always tag the same person in Truckee every time I've been there.
307000	309000	Like the one person with a 3DS in Truckee.
309000	313000	The one person in Truckee. I've tagged them twice which I'm pretty sure I know who it is.
313000	318000	I think it's somebody who works at Bespoke which is where I go get neat typography cards.
318000	319000	Okay.
319000	322000	And the guy who, but there was a lady this time. The guy wasn't there.
322000	325000	But Bespoke is a really cool little shop in Truckee.
325000	329000	And you know, I go to the Truckee Candy Company and Got Fudge.
329000	333000	I love that you kind of like, have you guys done this with the 3DS street passing?
333000	336000	Like you've kind of like narrowed down. Like it's kind of like 3DS stalking.
336000	337000	Yeah.
337000	341000	But not like, I don't want to use the word stalking, but I can't think of a better word for it.
341000	344000	Like it's like the whole like deduction. Like I know who you are.
344000	347000	Like there's a random person I keep trading with that's got to be one of my neighbors.
347000	351000	And I'm like, are they an adult? Because they might not be.
351000	355000	Well I'm sort of recognizing a couple of people I tag at the Land of Cubes in Tech.
355000	363000	And I tagged, there's this one girl at like, I always tag her at Starbucks.
363000	366000	And for a moment I thought she actually worked at one of them.
366000	368000	So I said, hey, does somebody by this name work here?
368000	371000	They're like, no, but man, I tagged this person too.
371000	375000	Because I said it was on the, so it was pretty cool.
375000	380000	But yeah, I tagged somebody from Argentina the last, not this past time I was in Truckee.
380000	381000	The week before.
381000	382000	Nice.
382000	385000	But no one this time. So I just, I grew a blue rose in Animal Crossing.
385000	386000	So I'm trying to grow another one.
386000	389000	Did you, did you, did the grass finally grow back where Ed used to live?
389000	390000	Yeah.
390000	391000	All right.
391000	394000	Look, he's been waiting there very patiently while we've been talking.
394000	395000	Hi, Loki.
395000	398000	We've been talking about fucking deer and shit and we will make you wait no longer.
398000	401000	Say hello via the Skyline everybody to Techmaster Loki.
401000	402000	Hey, how's it going?
402000	403000	Hey, good.
403000	408000	Sorry to make you sit through all that, but that was a, I love hearing about deer and stuff.
408000	412000	Have you, have you ever trekked out to the great unknown, Northern California?
412000	416000	I've been a few places, but I don't think I've ever been to Susanville.
416000	418000	Well, you're not missing much, to be honest.
418000	423000	You're usually the one that has to drive, so you don't get to do a lot of gaming on the long car trips, right?
423000	424000	That is correct.
424000	425000	Yeah, I gotcha.
425000	429000	Well, Techmaster Loki, of course, joining us via the Skyline once again here.
429000	436000	For those of you that have missed the memo, they had a baby about seven weeks ago at this point.
436000	437000	Eight? It's almost two months, right?
437000	439000	Yeah, about like six weeks, seven weeks.
439000	446000	So, Loki is joining us via the Skyline while the wife is still healing from delivery, but she, Mrs. Loki is still doing A-OK, right?
446000	447000	Yeah, she's doing fine.
447000	448000	Awesome to hear.
448000	458000	Hopefully, I don't know if we've planned the return date for Loki yet, but we're crossing our fingers and our toes that you'll be able to join us when we're back in two weeks at the new studio.
458000	459000	Is that looking like-
459000	461000	I don't know yet, so.
461000	462000	It's fine.
462000	466000	We gotta let Mrs. Loki heal up and all that good stuff, so Loki will have to take the time he needs.
466000	471000	But yeah, tonight, of course, is the last episode in the studio that we're at currently.
471000	477000	And I gotta admit, with all the internet up and down time we have sometimes, I won't miss it in that regard.
477000	484000	But Loki hasn't seen the place since before Christmas, so everything will be different for him when he finally does come back.
484000	491000	Dark Sakura, any fond memories of studio apartment dump-a-roo that you're gonna miss?
491000	494000	Well, I haven't passed out on your bed here.
494000	504000	So I guess, and this is gonna be a little sad, but I had very happy memories of cuddling with the kitties with Marco and Sanrio-chan.
504000	509000	Which, they both had their name as Maru-chan and San-chan for me.
509000	512000	And kind of answered to it.
512000	514000	By the way, I found a picture of the fucking deer.
514000	522000	We are concerned how the cat's gonna handle the move, but we think at the end of the day, she's gonna love all the extra sun that the new place gets.
522000	525000	So we think that'll end up being an awesome thing.
525000	530000	So, let's see. So yeah, we will be off next week.
530000	535000	Well actually, I should say this, we are actually still gonna do a show. We're gonna do a show in advance.
535000	538000	So it's not something that's gonna be broadcast live.
538000	542000	It's gonna be an intentionally shorter show that we're gonna tape during the week.
542000	545000	And then we'll actually broadcast it on the feed at the normal time.
545000	550000	And it will take our slot at VOG next Sunday, right after Bobby Black Wolf.
550000	553000	So, sadly the interaction portion will be missing next week.
553000	558000	But we will have something new for you guys on the feed, so you guys won't totally miss us.
558000	562000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,
562000	568000	Sky, better internet in the new studio? I hope so. It's to be determined. We don't know yet.
568000	573000	You know, we're really at the mercy of our provider, so I'm hoping it will be fine.
573000	576000	But we will see. I can say this, we're gonna have a lot more space.
576000	586000	It's gonna be back more to those of you guys that have been here since the days when we were in the actual garage studio
586000	590000	that we would broadcast on JUSTIN TV, because Twitch didn't exist then.
590000	594000	It's gonna be a little more like that. We're not gonna be in a garage,
594000	598000	but we'll have an entire section of the house about that big that we get to kind of dedicate to the studios.
598000	602000	Because podcasting is such a big part of my life, so there's that.
603000	607000	Also on tonight's show, coming up, I want to make sure I plug this.
607000	611000	This was thrown together very last minute, but that's how we roll here at Orange Lounge Radio,
611000	615000	and I'm actually very excited to welcome back an old friend of ours to the show.
615000	617000	We're gonna welcome back to Segg.
617000	622000	Segg, of course, has been here before, pimping some various projects he's been working on in the past.
622000	628000	One thing he's gonna talk to us about tonight is he's gonna talk to us about a new game that's coming out this week, actually.
628000	634000	This game's got a bit of buzz around it, so we want to let Segg talk about this game and answer your guys' questions live.
634000	642000	The game is called Dom Pamplemousse, and it is about gender, the economy, and characters that burst into song.
642000	645000	It's kind of like an episode of Glee, it's sounding like. I don't know.
645000	649000	I'm gonna ask Segg how much this game has in common with Glee.
649000	655000	But I will say, it seems like the actors are all better looking, because they're stop-motion figures.
655000	658000	So that's already a step up on Glee, so there you go.
658000	663000	So we're gonna talk to Segg about that, probably at the top of Part B a little later on.
663000	665000	There's quite a bit I could say that's a step up from Glee.
665000	672000	There is quite a bit. Maybe that's not the nicest thing to do, is to compare this game to Glee, but I'm actually trying to say it's better.
672000	673000	It's better, guys, it's better.
673000	675000	Lots, lots, much better.
676000	684000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, sg100matt, giving some tips on moving cats.
684000	688000	I know it's a video game podcast, but hey, cat talk is important, too.
688000	693000	sg100matt says, best way to move cats is to move everything into the house first, including the litter box.
693000	700000	Bring the cat into the house with everything from the old place in it, so that way they recognize the scent of everything and be more at ease.
700000	702000	Luckily, that's exactly our plan.
702000	703000	That's what we did with Shermie.
704000	709000	We're going to move her when we move all the big furniture, but we're going to set up all the litter and stuff in advance.
709000	713000	We fully expect she'll hide behind the toilet in the bathroom for a day, because that's what she did when we moved here.
713000	715000	So, the more you know.
715000	719000	Well, I told you about Dan moving Shermie over to the house, right?
719000	720000	I don't think so.
720000	722000	I passed out, took a nap.
722000	729000	The last little thing in the house was Shermie in her bed, looking around pathetically, like, where are all my people?
729000	731000	Where's all my stuff?
731000	737000	So, Dan comes in while I'm passed out in the bed, taps my foot, and then drops the cat on me in her bed.
737000	740000	And said, she was looking lonely, here's the cat.
740000	741000	And I'm like, Shermie!
741000	743000	And then she died.
745000	747000	That's horrible, why am I laughing?
747000	750000	It's because the way you delivered that, you're awful.
750000	753000	I just couldn't help, you know, I miss my Shermie.
753000	754000	She was a good cat.
754000	756000	I know you miss Mariko, too.
756000	758000	I know, but you have Midna.
758000	759000	I have Midna.
759000	761000	Midna's a little fucking brat.
761000	769000	No, no, no, no, she's like, mom, mom, feed me, feed me, it's five in the morning, feed me, mom, mom, no cat, busy.
769000	771000	You're just sleeping, you're not busy.
771000	774000	And Will stayed over with his dog, Wintu.
774000	778000	And the two of them were like, he tried to eat her tail.
778000	783000	But not like in a, I mean, she tried to eat Midna's tail, not in a malicious way, just in a, what's this kind of way?
783000	784000	Chew, chew, chew.
784000	786000	And Midna's like, bitch, literally.
786000	788000	So, anyway.
788000	790000	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
790000	792000	We're only like 12, 13 minutes into the show.
792000	793000	We haven't even hit our kickoff topic tonight.
793000	799000	But this is going to be quick because I'm going to actually ask some questions of Dark Sakura and Loki.
799000	801000	Loki, you ready to answer some questions?
801000	803000	I know Jamie's kind of been chatting away here at the top of the show.
803000	805000	You ready to answer some questions?
805000	806000	All right.
806000	807000	All right. Here's the deal.
807000	811000	Here's why I'm going to ask some questions because I, you know, I try, I try to be hip.
811000	815000	I try to be cool, you know, even, even as I'm getting older, I try to, I try to hang with the cool kids.
815000	818000	And I stay on top of like all the latest and greatest in social media.
818000	824000	And I try to figure out, you know, how could, how could OLR or VOG or, or Hoard House or whatever project I'm working on.
824000	826000	How can we embrace social media?
826000	829000	So one of the sites that I got turned on to recently was a site.
829000	830000	Can we kiss it?
830000	831000	Huh?
831000	832000	Can we kiss it?
832000	833000	You can try. You want to come over here and kiss it?
833000	834000	No.
834000	835000	It's a website.
835000	836000	You said embrace.
836000	838000	This is a new website called, well, I guess it's not that new.
838000	842000	It's actually been around a couple of years, but I'm treating it like it's new because that's what, you know, older people do.
842000	844000	It's a site called ask.fm.
844000	852000	And I guess it's really popular with like the, probably like high school crowd and stuff because what you do, you ask anonymous questions.
852000	857000	Now some people use this to ask mean questions, but I put this out on Twitter.
857000	860000	I said, hey, ask me whatever you want anonymously.
860000	861000	It can be about OLR.
861000	864000	It can be about anything, you know, ask me whatever you want.
865000	878000	Because I've been very fortunate in the position I'm at here at OLR where sometimes I get questions about like, you know, from people that might be wondering like how I came out or whatever and are struggling maybe with something similar without themselves or so I wanted to just put that out there.
878000	880000	Hey, if you want to ask something anonymously, go for it.
880000	886000	I'm pretty much an open book with three shows a week out there on iTunes anyway, you know, ask.
886000	890000	So I've been getting a variety of questions, but some of them have been video game related questions.
890000	897000	So I thought I would, I would give some of this ask.fm and share some of this ask.fm joy with DarkSakura and Loki.
897000	900000	So you guys want to answer some of the questions that I've got on ask.fm this week?
900000	901000	Sure.
901000	902000	You really don't have a choice because here it goes.
902000	903000	Okay.
903000	910000	So one of the questions I got, if you were an RPG class, which one would you be and why?
912000	913000	A class?
913000	919000	Yeah, like a white mage or a fighter or a, it doesn't, you know, I'm, my mind goes to Final Fantasy, but maybe not necessarily Final Fantasy.
920000	929000	I would be the fuck shit up bitch. No, I don't think that's a class.
929000	936000	I don't know. I've taken like a bajillion different quizzes as to, you know, what class, cause I like answering the stupid fucking quizzes.
936000	942000	So like for my Homestuck thing, I always get, um, Silph of Heart. So, which is like a healer class.
942000	943000	Okay.
943000	948000	Um, for most of the others, like I really love Summoner, so I'd probably be a Summoner.
948000	951000	Ah, you would summon the creatures of the world to kill things for you.
951000	953000	Yeah. And then I'd sit back and read a book while they kill shit.
953000	955000	Okay. That sounds, that sounds very Jamie. I like that.
955000	959000	How about you, Loki? If you were an RPG class, what would you be and why?
959000	961000	Uh, I don't know.
963000	965000	These questions aren't always easy, is it?
965000	977000	Well, I just normally play like kind of middle, middle of the road, everything. So, you know, like in Final Fantasy 11, I guess that was red mage, but, uh, something like that, I guess.
977000	980000	You'd be like, uh, Edgar in Final Fantasy 6.
980000	981000	I, I think so.
981000	982000	Sure, why not?
982000	983000	Mechanist?
983000	985000	Yeah, a Mechanist or something like that, yeah.
985000	987000	Or if it was Ragnarok, I think you'd be a blacksmith.
987000	989000	Yeah, where he kind of, kind of the tech guy.
989000	992000	Which by the way, playing a blacksmith is pretty fun in Ragnarok.
992000	995000	But it has to be a tech guy that never fully masters a class.
995000	1002000	For Loki. He gets to like 90% and then switches to a different class. That would be Loki.
1002000	1014000	Um, here's the next question. And remember guys, I did not brief Dark Soccer and Loki on these questions in advance. We're doing this live, so these answers are very, uh, very raw and might take them a second.
1014000	1017000	Uh, and if you guys want to answer, go to live.vognetwork.com.
1017000	1024000	Uh, Queen Simea says, I'm most likely blue mage because I depend on being able to imitate things really well for work.
1024000	1031000	You know what, that was actually my answer. I said I would be a blue mage and absorb the powers of my enemies and turn around and use those powers against them.
1031000	1033000	That was, that was my answer.
1033000	1036000	I do kind of like whatever the Moogles do in 6, where they just dance.
1036000	1037000	They dance! It's a dancer!
1037000	1039000	They shake their ass at you and then you die.
1041000	1044000	Alright, awesome. Uh, Raginator says he's a berserker.
1044000	1048000	Uh, so there you go. Alright, uh, here's the next question. Loki, I'll start with you.
1048000	1054000	What's the largest amount of time that you've clocked playing a video game?
1055000	1059000	Uh, that would probably be Final Fantasy XI if I'm guessing.
1059000	1061000	I had a feeling. Why that one?
1062000	1065000	Because that's the one I played the longest amount of time, I think.
1065000	1070000	Um, even like Grand Theft Auto IV could be close.
1070000	1074000	I don't remember the actual stats on that because I don't think they actually track time.
1074000	1079000	Um, but I mean, I played enough to where I was at, like, for the...
1079000	1083000	Because we used to do private games, so unranked private games, and we were at the top of the list.
1083000	1086000	I don't know why they kept score on that, but we were at the top of the list for that.
1086000	1089000	So, I played a lot of that.
1089000	1090000	Alright, very good.
1090000	1094000	Darsakra, what's the largest amount of time you've clocked playing a video game?
1094000	1098000	Well, if you want to count just actually being logged into the game,
1098000	1101000	Ragon Rock Online, I did stay logged in for an entire week.
1101000	1103000	Because I'd keep switching to my merchant.
1103000	1105000	Yeah, because you have to do the merchant, and you have to AFK on purpose.
1105000	1109000	But, I told you about the week I skipped school to play Final Fantasy VI, or III as it was over here.
1109000	1110000	Yeah.
1110000	1111000	Yeah, I did that.
1111000	1114000	Woke up in the morning, played the game, went to bed, I beat it in a week.
1115000	1119000	And I was taking my sweet time too, just wandering around and writing shit down.
1119000	1121000	I wrote myself a strategy guide, Rob.
1121000	1122000	Oh my god.
1122000	1126000	Yeah, because I used to be really super anal and take notes and draw maps and shit.
1126000	1128000	And...
1128000	1133000	I probably played that game like...
1133000	1138000	Yeah, I would sleep and then get up and play that game some more.
1138000	1140000	And then, um...
1140000	1143000	So that's probably the most continuous, but I mean...
1143000	1148000	Keep in mind though, I've been playing Animal Crossing since May last year.
1148000	1153000	Yeah, and honestly, has the game changed that much since the GameCube?
1153000	1155000	Yes, a little.
1155000	1159000	You've kind of been playing it consistently since 2002.
1159000	1163000	Well, no, not consistently, because remember I kind of quit the other ones.
1163000	1167000	But this one I've really been enjoying, and I have a Blue Rose now, so shut up.
1167000	1174000	Yeah, now that I think of it, maybe even Dance Dance Revolution, I guess, as a whole, would be probably the most...
1174000	1180000	I'm thinking of those sessions of playing. How long have you sat and gamed consecutively?
1180000	1185000	My answer to this was World of Warcraft, obviously, for the same type of thing.
1185000	1188000	Just with everything there was to do in that game and the social aspects of it.
1188000	1193000	But I also tried to give a non-MMO answer, and I said, honestly, what comes to mind is Mass Effect 3.
1193000	1196000	And that's because of the multiplayer mode, in large part.
1196000	1202000	I didn't play through it 17 times or whatever, like Dark Soccer did, but it was that multiplayer mode was a great...
1202000	1205000	Last year, I spent a lot of time playing that.
1205000	1213000	Actually, I'm going to say as far as continuous gaming goes, actually being up and playing the whole thing, the first Mass Effect that I marathoned my second time through.
1213000	1217000	Which is so funny, because I was guilty of this too.
1217000	1220000	And this was another question that I got earlier, was something along the lines of,
1220000	1224000	what was a game you completely misjudged the first time you played it?
1224000	1227000	I said Mass Effect, easy. I know you did that too.
1227000	1229000	Loki, what about you? I'll throw that question out there too.
1229000	1233000	What was a game that you completely misjudged the first time you played it, and went back and loved it?
1233000	1238000	Once again, going back to the longest time played it, it's not a video game, but I have QZAR.
1238000	1240000	I played over 500 hours of that.
1240000	1241000	Wow.
1241000	1245000	And then Minecraft.
1247000	1249000	I didn't get it at first.
1249000	1254000	Okay, yeah, that's right. I remember you didn't get Minecraft at first either, and you talked about that on the show.
1254000	1255000	Alright.
1255000	1261000	Alright, I got one last question for you guys, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and housekeeping and all that.
1261000	1268000	And this one's a good one, and this is very characteristic of the type of questions we really get on Ask.fm.
1268000	1270000	DarkSaga, I'll start with you.
1270000	1274000	Because I already know, I think I know what one of them is going to be.
1274000	1275000	Oh shit.
1275000	1282000	Based on looks alone, what two video game characters would you date, and why?
1282000	1287000	See, I'm not like an aesthetic person. That's the thing. I don't care about what someone looks.
1287000	1290000	I care about the person behind it.
1290000	1296000	You know, okay, I would go by, I could say by voice. I mean, definitely if you want to.
1296000	1299000	But based on pure aesthetics.
1299000	1300000	Okay, yes.
1300000	1301000	Pure aesthetics.
1301000	1302000	Uh, fuck balls.
1302000	1304000	Dish, dish girl, dish.
1304000	1308000	God, I'm trying to think. Actually, I can tell you who my first video game crush was.
1308000	1309000	Okay.
1309000	1310000	It's Ryu and Street Fighter.
1310000	1311000	Okay, that's a good answer.
1311000	1312000	Yeah?
1312000	1313000	Yeah.
1313000	1317000	And so yeah, Ryu would be on the list. Even though he's like kind of old and grizzled now, he's still awesome.
1317000	1318000	Yeah.
1318000	1320000	And then Strider, hear you.
1320000	1323000	Ah, these are good answers. I like that.
1323000	1327000	But that's based on aesthetics. If you wanted to go for hotness and voice, you know, I could tell you that.
1327000	1331000	I was going to say, I was going to sit here and think Garrus. I mean.
1331000	1333000	Well, he's not really very pretty, is he?
1334000	1338000	Yes, but the voice. Once you started to talk about the voice.
1338000	1342000	Okay, okay, okay. If it was a Mass Effect character, I was going to go for pretty.
1342000	1348000	The Bishouden of the game is Thane pretty much because he's there to be, you know, sleek, lizardy and pretty.
1348000	1352000	And you know, have his own spotlight and glimmer and make you hallucinate if you like him.
1352000	1357000	And the Citadel is so good with him. So good.
1357000	1371000	You know, but as much as I adore the character for Garrus, a lot of the, I would say, attraction for the character has to do with, you know, that whole attitude and the voice.
1371000	1381000	And I admit, I admit I like the spiky bit. That's kind of cool. But I don't know. I just don't think about outward appearances.
1381000	1382000	It's fine.
1382000	1385000	So I'm seeing who's pretty. Strider, hear you is pretty.
1385000	1391000	I actually called, when I answered this question on my own page, I put, you're making me superficial with this answer.
1391000	1398000	But I ended up saying, I said, I said Nathan Drake from Uncharted because, what can I say? I like Scruff and that stuff.
1398000	1402000	And I also said default male Shepard for Mass Effect.
1402000	1403000	Really?
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1405000	I don't think he's all that hot.
1405000	1410000	Whatever. That's because you're, that's because you're Team FemShep purity.
1412000	1413000	You know, okay.
1413000	1419000	Team FemShep purity means there's no such thing as male Shep. There's like, he doesn't exist in their minds.
1419000	1425000	You know what, you know, I am gonna, fuck, I was sitting here thinking about it and you know what, I am going to go back and put Garrus on my list.
1425000	1426000	Garrus and Strider, hear you.
1426000	1427000	Okay.
1427000	1428000	I'll tell you why.
1428000	1429000	Why?
1429000	1433000	Because actually I did think that the spiky bits were awesome.
1433000	1440000	And I did like the voice and I did like the walk and that's why I started playing Mass Effect to begin with anyway.
1440000	1441000	So.
1441000	1442000	All right. Fair enough.
1442000	1443000	Can I have three?
1443000	1444000	Sure. Take all you want.
1444000	1451000	Okay. I want Ryu, Strider, hear you, and, oh, actually, you know who's better than hear you?
1451000	1454000	All right. It's a three hour show, Dark Sakura, not 17.
1454000	1457000	Genjiro and Samurai Shodown was one of my other ones.
1457000	1458000	Okay. Okay. So fuck.
1458000	1459000	All right.
1459000	1460000	Fuck.
1460000	1461000	The listeners are dying to know.
1461000	1466000	And I've been sitting here like not looking at chat so I can't be influenced by anything going on.
1466000	1467000	They're all saying Garrus, Garrus, Garrus.
1467000	1468000	Fuck.
1469000	1473000	Clerical Error 404 says, Chris Redfield and Bayonetta for me.
1473000	1474000	Bayonetta's really hot.
1474000	1475000	Ooh, Bayonetta's hot.
1475000	1476000	Really hot.
1476000	1477000	All right.
1477000	1478000	I'd hit that.
1478000	1479000	Hold on though.
1479000	1480000	We gotta go.
1480000	1481000	Because the chat, everybody in the universe.
1481000	1482000	I do not like Liara.
1482000	1483000	Shh. Settle down.
1483000	1485000	The entire universe is dying to know.
1485000	1490000	Loki, based on Looks Alone, what two video game characters would you date and why?
1490000	1496000	Well, clearly at the top of my list of me, if we're going by Looks Alone, it's gotta be the Native American woman from Custer's Revenge.
1496000	1498000	I mean, those pixels.
1501000	1502000	Win.
1503000	1504000	You are awful.
1504000	1506000	You're an awful, awful person.
1507000	1508000	Come on, Loki.
1509000	1510000	Uh, let's see.
1510000	1511000	What else?
1511000	1513000	Uh, I don't know.
1513000	1515000	They're video games.
1515000	1523000	Um, I guess, uh, we'll pick, uh, Kinzie from the Saints Row series.
1523000	1524000	Okay.
1524000	1528000	And she's this, like, hot, nerdy chick that's into S&M.
1528000	1530000	So that'd be kinda, kinda cool.
1530000	1531000	Okay.
1531000	1532000	I'm with you.
1532000	1533000	I'm with you.
1533000	1534000	And then number two.
1534000	1535000	No, that was number two.
1535000	1536000	No, that was.
1536000	1537000	Oh, you were serious about that.
1537000	1538000	All right.
1538000	1539000	All right.
1539000	1540000	Fair enough.
1540000	1541000	Fair enough.
1541000	1542000	All right.
1542000	1543000	Uh, guy.
1543000	1544000	Of course, our chat room, uh, they're dying over there after hearing that ish, that one.
1544000	1545000	All right.
1545000	1546000	Love it.
1546000	1548000	GameGrew in chat says it perfectly.
1548000	1550000	GameGrew over at live.vognetwork.com.
1550000	1552000	Loki is magnificent troll.
1552000	1556000	I mean, if we're, we're doing my aesthetics, then I guess you could say mama, because,
1556000	1559000	you know, at least she'd be cooking something.
1559000	1563000	You know, I, so there's that plus to it.
1563000	1565000	I mean, cause everybody else is just video game characters.
1565000	1567000	I mean, everybody good at killing things.
1567000	1569000	I mean, that doesn't do me any good.
1569000	1573000	Mama does do the cooking and the gardening and the, and the baby.
1573000	1574000	And the crafting.
1574000	1578000	So yeah.
1578000	1579000	You're a bad man, Loki.
1579000	1580000	All right.
1580000	1582000	I have another person out of my list.
1582000	1583000	What?
1583000	1584000	Rex.
1584000	1589000	See, once you got started on the Mass Effect thing, now there's no tournament.
1589000	1590000	Oh, come on.
1590000	1592000	How, how lame is it that Rex wasn't romancable?
1592000	1596000	See, originally when you said Rex, I, cause I didn't play Mass Effect.
1596000	1598000	I thought you were talking about Metal Gear Rex.
1598000	1600000	And I'm like, wow, that's just weird.
1600000	1601000	Okay.
1601000	1603000	I'd probably go after Snake too.
1603000	1604000	All right.
1604000	1606000	Look enough, enough, enough.
1606000	1607000	We're done with the, uh,
1607000	1610000	You want to hide in this box?
1610000	1611000	Did you hear what he just said?
1611000	1612000	What?
1612000	1615000	Do you want to hide in this box?
1615000	1616000	Sure.
1616000	1617000	All right.
1617000	1618000	Gaming weeks.
1618000	1621000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1621000	1623000	What haven't I been playing?
1623000	1626000	It's important to establish the frame of reference we come from this week.
1626000	1628000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1628000	1632000	I did stuff.
1632000	1633000	You all right over there?
1633000	1634000	Chat.
1634000	1635000	Oh.
1635000	1636000	I'm sorry.
1637000	1638000	All right.
1638000	1640000	Put chat down and tell us what your gaming week was.
1640000	1641000	Okay.
1641000	1642000	I played some stuff.
1642000	1643000	I actually did play Mass Effect 3.
1643000	1646000	I have played, um, some Final Fantasy 14.
1646000	1648000	I played a shit ton of Animal Crossing.
1648000	1650000	And a shit ton more of Animal Crossing.
1650000	1652000	And I have a blue rose.
1652000	1653000	Damn.
1653000	1660000	And, um, um, um, um, I played some of that stuff we're moving on from on the website.
1660000	1662000	Just to hear how awful my voice is.
1662000	1665000	And I haven't been playing Bravely Default because I'm still fucking playing Zelda.
1665000	1671000	And I need to actually put some time into Zelda, which I will be able to do once I am done with other job.
1671000	1675000	And I am going to be done with other job this week.
1675000	1679000	And, um, you know, and Ronchon, I will, I don't know.
1679000	1682000	I respect Patty greatly, but I don't know.
1682000	1684000	There might be some fighting going on over that bandana.
1684000	1687000	Um, but yeah.
1687000	1689000	It's not like a whole bunch of stuff.
1690000	1696000	Oh, and I bought a game that's called Year Walk that I'm probably going to be starting tomorrow night, to be honest.
1696000	1698000	Because it just, it was really interesting.
1698000	1706000	It's based off of the, like, I think they said it was a Swedish concept of a year of walking or something.
1706000	1708000	Or a walk of a year or something.
1708000	1710000	But it looked like it was a really neat kind of first person game.
1710000	1712000	So I bought that and I'm going to play it.
1712000	1714000	And, um, yeah.
1714000	1718000	I've also been playing, um, like some weird mahjong game.
1718000	1722000	That's like, it changes the tile puzzles every stage that you get.
1722000	1724000	It's so weird, but it's kind of addicting.
1724000	1726000	So, yeah, that's what I've been playing.
1728000	1729000	Some stuff.
1729000	1730000	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
1730000	1732000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1732000	1734000	Uh, I didn't play a whole ton this week.
1734000	1737000	I did get to play a lot more of South Park, the Stick of Truth.
1737000	1739000	And the game is just awesome.
1739000	1744000	I mean, the aesthetics of the game alone, it's just, it's like I'm watching the cartoon.
1744000	1745000	It's fantastic.
1745000	1747000	And the humor and it's great.
1747000	1751000	There's so many small references to all the different episodes in the series.
1751000	1755000	It's seriously packed with so much fan service.
1755000	1756000	It's ridiculous.
1758000	1762000	I can't wait to play the game, but I haven't been able to tackle it yet.
1762000	1764000	But it's definitely on my to-do list.
1764000	1766000	Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
1766000	1767000	Alright, that's it?
1767000	1768000	Just South Park this week for you?
1768000	1772000	Uh, a little Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1772000	1776000	And, yeah, I think that was it.
1776000	1777000	Alright.
1777000	1781000	My gaming week wasn't too thrilling, but keep in mind I'm going through this,
1781000	1784000	just keep in mind I'm going through this whole move thing right now.
1784000	1791000	So, I don't have a whole lot to share besides I've been playing Diablo 3 quite a bit.
1791000	1796000	Click, click, click, find treasure, click, click, adventure is Diablo 3.
1796000	1800000	I've actually finally hit max level and I'm going through the Paragon levels.
1800000	1804000	I think at last check I was Paragon 9 was where I was at in the game.
1804000	1809000	So, yeah, quite the turnaround from not really caring for Diablo a lot a lot at first,
1809000	1811000	but now I've been playing more and more of that.
1811000	1814000	The 2.0 patch really did great things.
1814000	1819000	The 50% experience boost they've got going right now is a great incentive to get back in there and check it out.
1819000	1823000	So, yeah, I approve of what they've been doing there with Diablo 3.
1823000	1827000	And that's honestly, like between that and Final Fantasy XIV, that's really it.
1827000	1832000	I downloaded stuff to hopefully play some more things,
1832000	1835000	but just with moving and everything I haven't been able to do a lot a lot.
1835000	1836000	So, that's that.
1836000	1838000	So, that's it for my gaming week.
1838000	1840000	So, let's go to housekeeping.
1840000	1844000	Just a few quick things for you guys here and then we're going to get into gaming news.
1844000	1846000	Very important for housekeeping.
1846000	1850000	If you haven't heard, it's been all over the network this weekend,
1851000	1855000	but over at the Voice of Geeks Network, we have a brand new show that just joined the network over the weekend.
1855000	1860000	That show is the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and we want to welcome them to the network.
1860000	1866000	If you've heard of this show before, probably because Grandpa, one of the hosts of Hoard House, which is on Wednesday nights,
1866000	1871000	actually launched this show as a Star Trek fan podcast and it's a lot of fun.
1871000	1876000	I actually was honored to be a guest on the show this last week on episode number five
1876000	1879000	and we talked about a particular episode of Deep Space Nine
1879000	1883000	and I was able to talk about some of my stories about going to the Star Trek experience and some of the live things.
1883000	1886000	And yeah, they're very, very well versed on Star Trek.
1886000	1890000	So, if you're a fan of the show, we urge you to check out the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.
1890000	1895000	It is going to be a premiere show on VOG Network, meaning we play it before it hits the feed
1895000	1899000	and that will be Thursdays at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern,
1899000	1903000	and then it's going to repeat on Fridays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
1903000	1905000	But guess what? We're going to do something new.
1905000	1908000	We're trying some new things with the new shows we launched in 2014.
1908000	1913000	We're actually going to preview a brand new episode of the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.
1913000	1917000	We're going to preview that episode tonight after OLR.
1917000	1921000	So, if you live listeners that like to stay up really late, we're going to play that show for you.
1921000	1924000	And it actually happens to be that episode I was on this week
1924000	1927000	and it's the only time we're going to be able to broadcast this episode on VOG
1927000	1931000	because come Thursday, they'll be on episode number six.
1931000	1933000	So, episode five, we'll play one time on the feed.
1933000	1936000	You're going to hear that tonight, a special preview episode after OLR.
1936000	1938000	That's only for the live listeners.
1938000	1940000	For those of you guys that are listening on the podcast feed,
1940000	1943000	though, we urge you to go on over to vognetwork.com and check out the show.
1943000	1948000	You can also check out the show on their website, starboardpowercoupling.com.
1948000	1952000	All right, that's I think all I have for housekeeping.
1952000	1957000	I know we've said this before, there is no show next week due to the move.
1957000	1961000	We will not be here next week. We will be back in two weeks.
1961000	1966000	But we will have a show that was priorly taped during the week
1966000	1968000	that will play on the feed and on the podcast.
1968000	1973000	So most people won't notice a hiccup except the fact that next week's show will be shorter as a result.
1973000	1977000	All right, let's get into the news. There's quite a bit that's happened this week, right, Loki?
1977000	1981000	That's right. One of the things that happened this week was Jack Trenton.
1981000	1987000	He is stepping down as the president of Sony Computer Entertainment.
1987000	1994000	And apparently his contract with Sony was up March 31st and is not being renewed.
1994000	1999000	And apparently this is a mutual agreement, so I guess he's moving on to other things.
1999000	2004000	And they're going to get some new blood as the president of the company, which should be interesting.
2004000	2010000	As long as it's not, you know, kutaragi.
2010000	2013000	We don't need cranny eating again.
2013000	2019000	But yeah, so they're going to have, I guess, Sean Layden will be taking over as president.
2019000	2024000	And he's been with the company for 15 years. So it'll be interesting.
2024000	2029000	I know, you know, I haven't really been too familiar with Jack Trenton,
2029000	2035000	but I know he definitely made a good impression on people at last year's E3.
2035000	2040000	So it'll be interesting to see how, you know, if their focus changes any,
2040000	2043000	or if they kind of keep on with what they're doing right now.
2043000	2046000	Yeah, this news kind of, I mean, it came out of nowhere in a way.
2046000	2050000	But I mean, these sort of stories usually do, you know.
2050000	2056000	These guys, they have their lives and they, you know, sometimes look for other opportunities,
2056000	2060000	as many of us do in our own lives, looking for jobs and so forth.
2060000	2064000	So, you know, when I heard this news about Jack Trenton, I was kind of, I was a little surprised,
2064000	2067000	because I was like, wow, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.
2067000	2071000	But then I also took a step back and I said, you know what, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.
2071000	2077000	I mean, Sony, during Jack Trenton's tenure, has really had some ups and downs.
2077000	2083000	I mean, he came in at a time when Sony was really being shit on after E3,
2083000	2086000	and he really helped to steer the boat around.
2086000	2089000	And there was some low points. It was certainly not perfect,
2089000	2093000	because, you know, the PlayStation hack and all that happened on his watch.
2093000	2099000	But he did what he had to do to make it right and try to make PlayStation Plus a really great deal,
2099000	2102000	which, you know, a lot of people are loving the PlayStation Plus.
2102000	2104000	And, of course, the PlayStation 4 very successful.
2104000	2109000	So, in many ways, you know, with all the news we've seen about how the PlayStation 4 has been selling,
2109000	2113000	he's leaving in a way kind of at the top of the game.
2113000	2116000	I mean, one could argue that, well, the Vita could be at a better spot.
2116000	2119000	But, you know what, he's leaving on a high note.
2119000	2124000	And I kind of go, okay, well, that, you know, you want to leave when things are on a high note.
2124000	2128000	And we'll find out after his tenure maybe if another company has snatched him up.
2128000	2133000	Sometimes you hear about these things in advance, and sometimes you don't.
2133000	2136000	Like, I think about when Don Mattrick left Xbox, really not that long ago.
2136000	2139000	That was announced right away that he was going to Zynga.
2139000	2142000	But, you know, I don't know. It was just a different situation over there.
2142000	2144000	Could he be the new CEO for King?
2144000	2148000	God, I hope not. Don't even tease. That's awful.
2148000	2152000	Well, I wonder, too, you know, these guys that go that high up,
2152000	2156000	he might not necessarily end up in the games industry.
2156000	2159000	I mean, it's usually an assumption that they're going to end up in a tech place somewhere.
2159000	2162000	But not necessarily. That's what I'm saying, not necessarily.
2162000	2166000	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com theorizing, saying,
2166000	2171000	I wonder where he will go to next. Watch him go to Google or Moto.
2171000	2173000	Hey, you know what, nothing like that's out of the question.
2174000	2179000	You know Reggie Fils-Aime over at Nintendo, very charismatic guy over at Nintendo.
2179000	2182000	You know what Reggie Fils-Aime, one of the jobs he did before he was at Nintendo?
2182000	2185000	You know what company he was an executive for?
2185000	2188000	If I'm not mistaken, somebody might call me out on this,
2188000	2192000	but I believe it was Panda Express was the company he was with.
2192000	2194000	Don't say that while I'm drinking stuff.
2194000	2196000	But you like Panda Express.
2196000	2201000	I'd have to go back and look. I thought it was Panda Express, though.
2203000	2205000	Well, Bobby said Panda Express.
2205000	2207000	Yeah. Oh, I trust Bobby. Bobby knows.
2207000	2209000	But yeah, and of course, obviously, they...
2209000	2211000	Now it's some freaking orange chicken.
2211000	2213000	Right? The hot and sour soup's the bomb.
2213000	2216000	I don't like hot and sour soup. But I love the orange chicken.
2216000	2217000	So...
2217000	2218000	God damn it.
2218000	2222000	Yeah, he was with Panda Management Company as Senior Vice President,
2222000	2225000	and then he was also with VH1 for a while.
2225000	2228000	He was also... Oh, this is why he's a badass, ladies and gentlemen.
2228000	2231000	He was also a Pizza Hut, so both answers were right.
2231000	2233000	He was Senior Director of National Marketing and Pizza Hut.
2233000	2235000	He was also a Proctor and Gamble.
2235000	2237000	And Reggie Fils-Aime, you'll love this, DarkSakura,
2237000	2240000	Head of Marketing for Guinness in the United States.
2241000	2243000	No wonder he's such a badass, right?
2243000	2244000	Fucking love Guinness.
2244000	2246000	Now I want fucking Guinness and orange chicken,
2246000	2248000	and I'm gonna call it the Reggie meal.
2251000	2252000	Why not?
2252000	2253000	Then you have to...
2253000	2255000	But in order to fully be the Reggie meal,
2255000	2259000	you would have to play around a Mario Kart or something when it's done.
2259000	2260000	Then I'd throw up.
2262000	2264000	I don't know. That just seems like a...
2264000	2267000	Well, if you throw up, then your body wasn't ready.
2270000	2272000	And DarkSakura has just died.
2272000	2275000	Ladies and gentlemen, she has just fallen out of her chair and died.
2275000	2276000	My butt's half on the chair.
2276000	2278000	Rest in peace, DarkSakura.
2278000	2280000	I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby now,
2280000	2282000	because did you watch Bill Cosby on the Daily Show?
2282000	2283000	No.
2283000	2284000	He kept falling out of the chair.
2284000	2285000	It was hilarious.
2285000	2287000	So I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby.
2287000	2288000	Alright, fine.
2288000	2290000	It's a good thing it's a radio show, DarkSakura,
2290000	2291000	because I can see you right now.
2291000	2292000	My back hurts.
2292000	2295000	Alright, speaking of Reggie and Mario Kart,
2295000	2298000	hey, Mario Kart 8 is gearing up,
2298000	2302000	and they're gonna really push the crap out of this game,
2302000	2305000	because this is a huge release for the Wii U.
2305000	2309000	We talked last week about how you're not gonna be able to play Mario Kart 7 online anymore,
2309000	2312000	and does it or does it not tie into this?
2312000	2313000	I don't know. We'll find out.
2313000	2316000	In fact, we have a very interesting email on the whole thing coming up later.
2316000	2317000	We'll talk about that.
2318000	2321000	But Mario Kart 8 is on its way out,
2321000	2325000	and some very interesting sponsorships to try to get awareness out there.
2325000	2331000	And one company that they've partnered up with to promote Mario Kart 8 is Pennzoil.
2331000	2334000	Now, I get that Pennzoil is obviously a motor...
2334000	2338000	If you guys don't know, that's a motor oil that they put in your car.
2338000	2340000	And if you didn't know that and you drive,
2340000	2342000	you want to go get your oil changed once in a while.
2342000	2344000	Pennzoil makes other additives and stuff.
2344000	2345000	They do. That's true.
2345000	2346000	And they're big in the racing circuit, obviously.
2346000	2349000	Oh my god, could you imagine the Mario NASCAR car?
2349000	2353000	They need to get Danica to get rid of GoDaddy and advertise Mario.
2353000	2358000	Well, anyway, so Pennzoil announced on Twitter that they are teaming up with Nintendo
2358000	2360000	to promote Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U,
2360000	2363000	and they're actually planning a demo at South by Southwest,
2363000	2366000	which is obviously a huge event down in Austin that they do.
2366000	2368000	So, you know, no surprise, they're taking the game there.
2368000	2371000	But it's just interesting that Pennzoil is kind of the sponsor.
2371000	2373000	Usually, you don't... I don't know.
2373000	2376000	I don't know. That's just not usually the type of company I see partnering,
2376000	2383000	but it obviously makes a lot of sense, even though Pennzoil is something I think of for real cars,
2383000	2386000	and Mario Kart is very fake in a way.
2386000	2388000	Like, look at some of the art for Mario.
2388000	2393000	Doesn't it look like they're trying to make Mario riding Tron bikes best they can
2393000	2395000	without it actually being a Tron bike?
2395000	2396000	Yeah.
2396000	2397000	And that whole thing.
2397000	2402000	Loki, what do you think about the partnership between Pennzoil and Mario Kart?
2402000	2405000	I don't think it's that big a deal.
2405000	2409000	I'm just wondering if we're going to see in-game advertisement for Pennzoil
2409000	2412000	and for all these other companies that they're partnering with,
2412000	2417000	because maybe they're not confident enough that the game will make enough money on its own.
2419000	2422000	But, I mean, as far as, like, partnering with other retailers
2422000	2426000	and different things for certain games, it's not anything new.
2426000	2433000	I mean, hell, they have, you know, merchandising with Kinects and stuff for toys, so why not?
2434000	2436000	Some folks in chat correcting me.
2436000	2440000	Dark Tetsuya said, I said Mario Kart 7, and I think you meant Mario Kart Wii.
2440000	2443000	Mario Kart 7 isn't, yeah, I misspoke.
2443000	2445000	Mario Kart 7 is 3DS, sorry.
2445000	2447000	Yes, I meant Mario Kart Wii.
2447000	2449000	But I'm sure there's people playing Mario Kart 7 as well.
2450000	2453000	But you can still play that through Nintendo Network as far as I know, so sorry about that.
2453000	2454000	I did misspeak.
2455000	2460000	Also in our chat room, Tigerclaw says it's a real-life Mario Kart, I guess,
2460000	2462000	and he actually links me to his story.
2462000	2463000	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
2464000	2469000	Also, one other quick note on Mario Kart, because, you know, it's not that far away, all things considered,
2469000	2471000	for such a huge game, just a couple months away.
2471000	2475000	Mario Kart's going to get a limited edition in Europe for Mario Kart 8.
2475000	2478000	It will come with a spiny shell collector's item.
2478000	2480000	Yes, you can have your very own blue shell.
2480000	2483000	No word if it will work if you throw it at people on the freeway, however.
2483000	2485000	It has a tail, but, like, two butt holes.
2487000	2490000	It actually looks kind of like a face with a weird helmet on it.
2490000	2492000	That's where the leg goes, that's where the other leg goes.
2492000	2496000	But it looks like either two butt holes or a weird face with a spiky helmet on it.
2496000	2499000	Well, how else is it supposed to rock it up to first place?
2502000	2504000	I approve of that fart joke.
2505000	2508000	Oh my gosh. Anyway, so yeah, there you go.
2508000	2514000	You can check that out. You can pre-order either retail or you can pre-order as a standalone game,
2514000	2516000	and you can get a Mario Kart themed key ring.
2516000	2518000	Again, that is all in the UK.
2518000	2521000	No word if we have anything similar here in the US,
2521000	2524000	although I would think they're going to try to do something here in the US,
2524000	2526000	especially for the Nintendo diehards.
2526000	2529000	Like, even a soundtrack or something. Who knows?
2529000	2533000	If I were to guess, they'd probably announce something on another Nintendo Direct,
2533000	2537000	usually between once they've announced the date for the game and when it comes out.
2537000	2540000	But it's nothing so far that I've heard of.
2540000	2546000	Gotcha. So, that's pretty cool that Mario Kart 8 is going to be at South by Southwest.
2546000	2548000	I know people really want to play this game.
2548000	2553000	Do you think Nintendo might have some hands-on availability soon for the game?
2555000	2559000	Like, you know, they've got those demo kiosks all over, like Game Stops and stuff, right?
2559000	2562000	Do you think they might have some hands-on availability really soon?
2562000	2564000	Maybe. It'd be a good way to sell the system.
2565000	2567000	I would think so. I would keep an eye on that stuff,
2567000	2570000	because I bet they're going to have the Mario Kart demos playable really soon
2570000	2573000	at places like Game Stop and all that stuff, so check that out.
2573000	2575000	Because I seem to recall some of the other Nintendo stuff.
2575000	2579000	They had about six weeks before it was actually out there.
2579000	2581000	Like, remember the E3 demos they had?
2581000	2584000	I want to say Mario was available in the stores beforehand,
2584000	2587000	so I would think you're going to start to see Mario Kart 8, like, at the end of the month.
2595000	2599000	Alright, let's move on. More news. DarkSakura.
2599000	2603000	I got some stuff. This is actually about Keiji Inafune.
2603000	2606000	As we know, he's the guy who created Mega Man,
2606000	2613000	but there is a 2D side-scroller game coming up for the 3DS eShop called Azure Striker Gunvolt,
2613000	2617000	which is supposed to play as some dude named Gunvolt,
2617000	2621000	and he has lightning powers, and he's trying to...
2621000	2626000	He's actually running away from a psychic girl that he was trying to kill.
2626000	2632000	But it looks like one of the Mega Man games as far as how it plays,
2632000	2636000	but it's got some other stuff going on with it that just...
2636000	2639000	It's supposed to change exactly how it plays, and I was watching a little bit of the play,
2639000	2641000	and it seems like it's pretty neat.
2641000	2649000	He's also collaborating with Team Ninja on a zombie spin-off game called...
2649000	2653000	A zombie spin-off of Ninja Gaiden called Yaba.
2653000	2657000	Azure Striker Gunvolt is going to be out in Japan in the summer,
2657000	2659000	but nothing about the west, of course.
2659000	2663000	I had no idea. I guess I just wasn't paying good enough attention.
2663000	2669000	I had no idea that he was working on anything besides that Kickstarter project at all.
2669000	2673000	This information came out from Gematsu.
2673000	2678000	He announced it at the BitSummit Indie Games Festival in Kyoto.
2679000	2684000	Which is interesting, because this is the type of thing they could have sat on for an E3 or something.
2684000	2687000	No, that's awesome that they did it at an indie game festival.
2687000	2688000	It looks pretty neat.
2688000	2690000	Very cool, yeah. I definitely want to check it out.
2690000	2691000	Yeah.
2691000	2694000	Loki, any thoughts on this game?
2694000	2695000	Azure Striker Gunvolt?
2695000	2697000	It looks cool.
2697000	2699000	I don't know.
2699000	2702000	Hopefully it doesn't get lost amongst all the other games I have to play this coming month.
2702000	2704000	We're starting to get into a crazy time of year.
2704000	2707000	Well, good for you. It's going to slow down.
2707000	2709000	Oh, that's good. Well, I've got to play South Park.
2709000	2712000	Once this move settles down, that's on my absolute to-do list.
2712000	2715000	And then the Final Fantasy X and X-2 remasters.
2715000	2717000	I have to do those. I love those games.
2717000	2719000	Yeah, I don't think those are...
2719000	2721000	You don't have to hurry that much on those.
2721000	2723000	You've played them before.
2723000	2726000	I know it's not for everybody, but I've got to.
2726000	2728000	I've got to.
2728000	2730000	We'll see. We'll see how far I get before I go like,
2730000	2731000	Ooh, distraction.
2731000	2733000	What can I do for you?
2734000	2736000	You can make Loki read the next story.
2736000	2738000	Hey, Loki, read the next story.
2738000	2740000	Alright, I guess I will.
2740000	2743000	So, we haven't talked about this company in a while,
2743000	2745000	but OnLive is back in the news.
2745000	2748000	They've got a brand new service called CloudLift,
2748000	2752000	and what CloudLift is doing is going to be offering
2752000	2754000	some different games on there.
2754000	2757000	I don't know if they're necessarily rebooting the whole thing,
2757000	2759000	but it looks like they have 20 games right now,
2759000	2763000	and it's going to include Saints Row IV, Batman Arkham City,
2763000	2767000	but they're also saying that they're going to have some MMOs as well at some point.
2767000	2771000	I guess they mentioned Second Life Go.
2771000	2774000	I don't know if that's any different than...
2774000	2777000	I guess that was the one that's on Android,
2777000	2781000	but it's kind of interesting that they're kind of going that route in there.
2781000	2783000	I don't know if it's necessarily going to be console games anymore,
2783000	2786000	or if it's going to be more like PC or something.
2786000	2791000	Also, they're saying with that, they're going to have it
2791000	2793000	where you can, of course, subscribe to stuff,
2793000	2797000	be able to stream games that you've purchased on Steam or Origin
2797000	2801000	or any other services that are compatible with OnLive as well.
2801000	2804000	So it looks like you'll be able to stream your own games,
2804000	2806000	plus stream games that maybe you don't own,
2806000	2809000	or you can buy games through them and that kind of stuff.
2809000	2814000	So a little bit of a mutation of OnLive.
2814000	2816000	It'll be interesting to see how it goes.
2816000	2818000	I've got to say, Loki, I'm kind of with you
2818000	2821000	that I did not realize that OnLive was still around.
2821000	2825000	I thought that they had folded for some weird reason.
2825000	2827000	Did they get sold or something?
2827000	2829000	Yeah, they got sold.
2829000	2833000	Oh, so this is the big reboot for them, right?
2833000	2834000	I think so, yeah.
2834000	2836000	Yeah, that makes sense.
2836000	2839000	So yeah, I'm trying to see what happened.
2839000	2842000	They had the OnLive desktop that came out in 2012,
2842000	2847000	and then on August 17th of 2012, the company laid off all its employees.
2847000	2849000	So okay, so we're not crazy.
2849000	2851000	Something really big did happen there,
2851000	2854000	and then they sold off the assets and started a new company,
2854000	2856000	also called OnLive.
2856000	2861000	Yeah, so with the OnLive stuff, like I said, they have CloudLift,
2861000	2864000	which this is what they're doing the beta test on right now,
2864000	2868000	and that basically allows you to download games into the cloud,
2868000	2872000	or you basically own a download copy at home
2872000	2876000	and play it in the cloud on multiple devices at any time.
2876000	2877000	Got it.
2877000	2881000	So they're saying also that they still have that play pack,
2881000	2883000	which is kind of like how OnLive was before.
2883000	2885000	It's like an instant cloud library,
2885000	2888000	so all these different games you can try for free and stuff.
2888000	2892000	So I don't know, it's a neat idea.
2892000	2895000	Yeah, Tigerclaw kind of puts us in another light in our chatroom
2895000	2897000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
2897000	2898000	Tigerclaw says,
2898000	2901000	This seems interesting because as your Steam library grows,
2901000	2904000	so will the amount of storage required to install them.
2904000	2907000	So having the ability to stream the games you already own
2907000	2909000	would be a good way to play them
2909000	2911000	without the need to install them in the first place.
2911000	2913000	You know, that is a good thought,
2913000	2917000	because I don't really want to run out and get a new hard drive,
2917000	2920000	and I'm kind of limited with the 500 gigs I have right now.
2920000	2922000	Or, here's another idea,
2922000	2925000	with the fact that they're saying that you can have games
2925000	2927000	streaming to an Android tablet,
2927000	2931000	you can take your Steam library with you on your tablet,
2932000	2935000	just go ahead and play it on the go.
2935000	2938000	Maybe be able to sync a Bluetooth controller to it or something
2938000	2940000	and be able to play games like that.
2940000	2941000	That'd be kind of cool.
2941000	2943000	It's very similar to the PlayStation 4 and the Vita,
2943000	2946000	the whole remote play thing, or even the Wii U in some ways, right?
2946000	2949000	Yeah, and then they also have the option
2949000	2953000	where they're going to allow you to play with a set-top box.
2953000	2955000	So they have some compatible stuff,
2955000	2958000	some smart TVs they're going to support on live as well.
2958000	2962000	One being, I guess they have the Google TV by LG
2962000	2964000	that's going to support it,
2964000	2967000	and the Vizio CoStar R2 that's support on live right now.
2967000	2971000	But, I don't know, I think it sounds kind of cool.
2971000	2973000	Yeah, I'll be very curious to see
2973000	2976000	maybe if they have a big presence at E3 this year,
2976000	2978000	as they did a few years ago when that company first started,
2978000	2981000	and everybody was like, this technology will never work.
2981000	2983000	I remember being at that E3 going,
2983000	2985000	this is never going to work, and it worked.
2985000	2987000	It was crazy.
2987000	2991000	Alright, well let's move on and talk about another type of streaming,
2991000	2992000	and that is Twitch.
2992000	2994000	You know, Twitch has been in the news a lot lately,
2994000	2998000	and they've really kind of been blown up as a big gaming company.
2998000	3000000	I mean, not in the same way as other companies
3000000	3002000	where they're actually making games,
3002000	3005000	but Twitch really is doing big things with gaming.
3005000	3009000	And the next big thing is streaming for iOS and Android.
3009000	3012000	That's right, pretty soon you're going to be able to stream, capture,
3012000	3015000	and archive your gameplay on Android and iOS devices
3015000	3018000	when developers enable the functionality in their games
3018000	3020000	with Twitch's Mobile Software Development Kit.
3020000	3022000	So that's an important thing,
3022000	3024000	is that this isn't like something you're going to be able to run
3024000	3026000	in the background and stream anything.
3026000	3029000	They're going to have to put this in the game
3029000	3031000	and offer the Twitch support within the game.
3031000	3033000	But I'm sure there will be plenty of games that actually pick this up.
3033000	3037000	Think of the way like Minecraft has Twitch streaming built in,
3037000	3040000	Path of Exile has Twitch streaming built in.
3040000	3042000	I can't think of other games,
3042000	3044000	but I know there's others out there that have that all built in.
3044000	3046000	And that's what's going to happen on some mobile phone games,
3046000	3048000	so they have to actually implement that.
3048000	3050000	And so once it's implemented,
3050000	3052000	users can actually work with video capture options
3052000	3054000	for like the front-facing camera,
3054000	3056000	so it can be pointed at you while you play.
3056000	3059000	Audio capture using either an internal or an external microphone,
3059000	3062000	and you can actually archive the stream on Twitch and all that.
3062000	3065000	So yeah, this is going to be very interesting
3065000	3068000	to see what games implement this and where it goes.
3068000	3070000	I would think that maybe Minecraft Pocket Edition
3070000	3072000	seems like a likely candidate,
3072000	3074000	if Minecraft has really embraced that whole thing.
3074000	3077000	It'll be very interesting to see what games implement this.
3077000	3080000	Also, big news out of Twitch.
3080000	3085000	Big steps to make themselves the new E3 place,
3085000	3087000	the place to see all the E3 content,
3087000	3090000	because G4 was the big place,
3090000	3092000	and they kind of went poop.
3092000	3095000	And Spike TV I think kind of picked up the slack for a couple years,
3095000	3098000	and I imagine is still going to do some things involving E3.
3098000	3100000	However, Twitch has signed a three-year deal
3100000	3103000	to be the gaming conference's official streaming partner.
3103000	3106000	So this means that official conference streams
3106000	3108000	will be broadcast through Twitch,
3108000	3112000	which if anybody tried to watch the Nintendo streams on Ustream,
3112000	3115000	this is great fucking news, just saying.
3115000	3117000	I would assume. I don't know.
3117000	3119000	Does the Nintendo Directs count as part of E3?
3119000	3121000	They might not.
3121000	3125000	But at least you know the Sony and the Microsoft ones and the EA and all that.
3125000	3126000	That'll all be through Twitch.
3126000	3128000	At least they have the YouTube live ones,
3128000	3133000	because the Nintendo Directs over Ustream fucking suck.
3133000	3134000	That's true.
3134000	3136000	Nintendo started implementing the YouTubes as well, huh?
3136000	3137000	I don't know.
3137000	3139000	It's yet to see if they're going to do Twitch as well.
3139000	3144000	But anyway, convention attendees are going to see Twitch feeds on monitors.
3144000	3147000	So that's going to be very interesting,
3147000	3149000	like actually at the convention.
3149000	3150000	There you go.
3150000	3153000	No word if those monitors will just be Twitch playing Pokemon
3153000	3156000	or Twitch playing E3 attendees or who knows what.
3156000	3158000	So there you go.
3158000	3160000	Big news coming out of Twitch.
3160000	3163000	Very interesting, the story of that company, especially.
3163000	3165000	You know, I know earlier in the show,
3165000	3167000	I talked about when we were streaming OLR on Justin TV.
3167000	3170000	If you think about it, that whole phenomenon started as a guy
3170000	3173000	who wore a webcam on his head everywhere he went.
3173000	3175000	And here we are.
3175000	3179000	That has morphed into now this E3 partner company.
3179000	3181000	It's really, really astonishing.
3181000	3182000	Yeah.
3182000	3185000	So anyway, let us move on.
3185000	3189000	Well, I feel really bad for our friends in South Africa
3189000	3191000	because guess what they don't get?
3191000	3193000	Titanfall.
3193000	3194000	You know why?
3194000	3196000	Because their internet sucks.
3196000	3200000	Basically, and this is the official word coming out of EA,
3200000	3203000	after conducting recent online tests for Titanfall,
3203000	3205000	we found that these performance rates in South Africa
3205000	3208000	were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience.
3208000	3212000	So we have decided not to release Titanfall in South America at this time.
3212000	3214000	You mean South Africa?
3214000	3215000	South Africa.
3215000	3216000	Sorry, South Africa.
3216000	3218000	Yeah, it's coming out in South America, somewhere there anyway.
3218000	3222000	So basically, they're like, sorry, but your internet sucks.
3222000	3224000	Get all of your upgrades to go in and we'll consider it.
3224000	3227000	So another fuck you to EA.
3227000	3230000	People in South Africa deserve to play Titanfall.
3230000	3232000	It's a lose-lose situation.
3232000	3237000	It's a lose-lose situation because if the game doesn't function properly,
3237000	3239000	then they're going to get bitched at.
3239000	3241000	If they hold it back, they're going to get bitched at.
3241000	3244000	They should have never announced the game in the region in the first place.
3244000	3246000	Shoulda, coulda, woulda.
3246000	3252000	Yeah, there's no easy, I mean, maybe they could cut the cord a little bit
3252000	3255000	with how much server reliance there is, but let's be real,
3255000	3257000	Titanfall is designed to be a multiplayer game.
3257000	3262000	Invest in the South African economy so that you can improve web service there
3262000	3264000	and then sell a bajillion copies of your game.
3264000	3265000	Not really.
3265000	3268000	I don't know if there's that big of a gaming audience in South Africa,
3268000	3270000	but there's certainly some people that are going to be pissed.
3270000	3271000	100% serious.
3271000	3276000	But, I mean, they need to do the research before they say,
3276000	3278000	oh yeah, you're going to get this.
3278000	3280000	So it's just disgusting.
3280000	3283000	It's another way that EA is fucked up.
3283000	3285000	Ouch.
3285000	3289000	All right, well, let's see what games are going to be coming to regions this week.
3289000	3292000	Sadly, we don't do South African release dates, but we do.
3292000	3293000	I could try.
3293000	3295000	We do start with U.S. release dates.
3295000	3297000	So, Loki.
3297000	3300000	Well, since we're not in South Africa,
3300000	3305000	we are getting Titanfall on Xbox One and PC this week.
3305000	3308000	Also, if you don't happen to own an Xbox One or PC,
3308000	3311000	you can get Dark Souls 2, I guess.
3311000	3313000	That's a good compromise, right?
3313000	3320000	So that will be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3320000	3323000	Beyond that, there wasn't really a whole bunch else.
3323000	3324000	Let's see.
3324000	3327000	We've also got, on 3DS at the end of the week,
3327000	3330000	the brand new Yoshi's New Island.
3330000	3332000	So that will be coming out.
3332000	3335000	And, let's see, what else?
3335000	3337000	Oh, some other games here.
3337000	3340000	Let's see, Atelier Asia and Loji,
3340000	3343000	Alchemist of the Dust Sky on PlayStation 3.
3343000	3346000	And then, because this game is going to truly be next gen,
3346000	3352000	Putty Squad on PlayStation 4, PS3, and Vita this week as well.
3353000	3358000	But you probably don't need that on PlayStation 4.
3358000	3360000	And by the way, this wouldn't be on your list
3360000	3362000	because I know you do retail stuff
3362000	3365000	and this game is coming on Steam and Humble Store
3365000	3366000	and digital platforms.
3366000	3369000	But our guest that's coming on later, the SEG,
3369000	3372000	wants us to make sure that we plug Dominique Pamplemousse
3372000	3373000	this week as well.
3373000	3375000	And that's on Tuesday,
3375000	3378000	and we'll give SEG plenty of time to promote the crap out of that.
3378000	3381000	But that is this week in the digital distribution channels.
3381000	3384000	All right, let's travel over to Japan
3384000	3385000	and check out what's coming out there.
3385000	3388000	I don't know if they get the Pamplemousse this week as well.
3388000	3391000	I'll have to ask SEG how the worldwide stuff works.
3391000	3394000	But I can tell you what is coming out on their consoles over there.
3394000	3397000	They are still basking in the launch of the PlayStation 4,
3397000	3399000	so we have no new games this week.
3399000	3402000	But we do have some games over on the PlayStation 3.
3402000	3404000	Just like Loki mentioned a minute ago,
3404000	3406000	Dark Souls 2 is coming out there
3406000	3408000	in a regular and collector's edition.
3409000	3413000	I don't know how well these games do in Japan.
3413000	3415000	Perhaps I see AkumaJP's in chat, maybe he knows.
3415000	3417000	I don't know if these games are very well received over there
3417000	3423000	because they're not like Final Fantasy games or other types of JRPGs.
3423000	3424000	They're hard as hell.
3424000	3426000	I think there would be a certain allure to those, but we'll see.
3426000	3429000	But those games are out on the PlayStation 3 this week,
3429000	3431000	Dark Souls 2 in regular and collector's edition.
3431000	3433000	Also on the Xbox 360.
3433000	3435000	By the way, Xbox 360 getting a ton of stuff
3435000	3437000	in the Platinum Collection as well in Japan,
3437000	3440000	including Forza Horizon, Gears of War trilogy pack,
3440000	3444000	and also there's some Xbox Live membership cards coming out in Japan
3444000	3446000	that are Titanfall branded.
3446000	3449000	But yet, I don't see Titanfall on their release schedule.
3449000	3452000	So, I don't know, that's weird.
3452000	3458000	On the PlayStation Vita, Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds on the 13th of March,
3458000	3460000	like all these other games are coming out.
3460000	3464000	And lastly but not leastly, taking a look at the Wii U and the 3DS.
3464000	3469000	On the 3DS, we have Chujin Ultra Baseball Card Battle.
3469000	3471000	For those of you that want to play baseball,
3471000	3472000	would you want to do it with cards?
3472000	3475000	But Rob, why would you be surprised if Titanfall is not coming to Japan?
3475000	3477000	The Xbox One hasn't launched there.
3477000	3478000	I said 360.
3478000	3480000	Oh yeah, that's not until the end of the month.
3480000	3481000	Ah, okay, there you go.
3481000	3485000	So, yeah, no, we still don't know when the Xbox One is out in Japan, right?
3485000	3487000	We're thinking at this point it's going to be holiday, right?
3487000	3488000	Ah, who knows.
3488000	3489000	I don't know.
3489000	3493000	One thing I am eyeing on the 3DS, this is a week off,
3493000	3499000	but on the 20th they're getting Game Center CX Sanchome no Arino.
3499000	3504000	Is this the sequel to Retro Game Challenge?
3504000	3506000	Because I kind of think it is.
3506000	3509000	There was supposed to be a third one coming, yeah.
3509000	3510000	That is fucking awesome.
3510000	3511000	Well, that's coming to Japan.
3511000	3513000	Like, yeah, I'm almost positive that's what this game is,
3513000	3517000	is the Retro Game Challenge, the next game in that series on the 3DS.
3517000	3519000	Yeah, the Game Center, yeah.
3519000	3521000	Yeah, hot.
3521000	3524000	All right, oh, quickly, I'm taking a peek at the Wii U.
3524000	3525000	Nothing on the Wii U this week.
3525000	3528000	Nothing new on the Wii U until the 27th.
3528000	3530000	So how about the UK, DarkSakura?
3530000	3532000	There's some stuff coming out.
3532000	3536000	I mean, we know that on the 13th Titanfall is the big thing over there.
3536000	3542000	But before that, 1954 Alcatraz is going to be out on the 11th,
3542000	3544000	and then that's for PC and Mac.
3544000	3548000	And then, like I said, on the 13th is Titanfall for,
3548000	3552000	it looks like Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC, it's saying.
3552000	3555000	And then on the 14th we have Dark Souls 2,
3555000	3558000	Darksiders Collection, and Red Faction Collection,
3558000	3560000	and Yoshi's New Island.
3560000	3562000	And that be all.
3562000	3563000	All right.
3563000	3568000	By the way, AkumaJP telling me that Dark Souls sells like hotcakes
3568000	3571000	over there in Japan, since I'd asked.
3571000	3572000	Thank you, Akuma.
3572000	3575000	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game,
3575000	3576000	O of the Week.
3576000	3577000	Loki.
3578000	3579000	All right.
3579000	3583000	So since we just got done talking about OnLive,
3583000	3586000	a service that we thought wasn't around anymore,
3586000	3589000	this one I'm surprised is still around, and that is the Ouya.
3589000	3594000	Well, as a last-ditch effort to make themselves relevant,
3594000	3599000	they have launched a new, I guess, focus that's called Ouya Everywhere.
3599000	3603000	It's basically Ouya without buying an Ouya.
3603000	3606000	So you are able to have the Ouya storefront and the OS
3606000	3612000	and that kind of stuff, but you'll be able to play it on TVs, PCs,
3612000	3615000	even without actually having a system.
3615000	3620000	And I guess one of the partners that they announced already,
3620000	3624000	I guess the first one, crazy enough, is their competitor,
3624000	3629000	the Mad Catz Mojo microconsole, which is coming out later this spring.
3629000	3631000	And that will support the Ouya.
3631000	3633000	I don't get it.
3633000	3637000	I mean, because at this point, it's like saying,
3637000	3641000	well, if I don't need the console to play these games,
3641000	3645000	especially a lot of these games that are on the Ouya console are on PCs,
3645000	3653000	so why would I get this for PC to play Android games that are also on PC?
3653000	3655000	I don't understand.
3657000	3659000	Yeah, it's interesting.
3659000	3665000	This does seem a little bit like, help, we're Ouya, help, look at us.
3665000	3668000	You know what I mean?
3668000	3670000	Yeah, here's their quote.
3670000	3674000	It says, one thing you'll start to see is Ouya on other people's devices.
3674000	3679000	We started with a $99 box, but we always wanted to create a console platform.
3679000	3681000	No, they didn't always want to create a console platform, come on.
3681000	3684000	They wanted to create a console platform that could live on other people's devices.
3684000	3686000	That was never the plan.
3686000	3689000	The plan is to make these microconsoles, and you thought they would take off, and they did.
3689000	3693000	We just knew it was going to take a little bit of time to get it ready.
3693000	3695000	Now, we think the software is good enough.
3695000	3698000	It'll be ready to be embedded in other people's devices.
3698000	3702000	We actually start having some of these conversations during CES,
3702000	3709000	and the take-up was so great that we're jumping into strategy with both of our feet this year.
3709000	3712000	Now, here's the thing with that Mojo console.
3712000	3715000	I think that even implements stuff a lot better than, say, the Ouya does,
3715000	3723000	because you can map the controls for any games, even games that are not meant to have actual controller inputs.
3723000	3725000	They're just touch screen only.
3725000	3728000	You can kind of map them so that they work with it.
3728000	3730000	I just don't know.
3730000	3733000	Honestly, it's been a while since I've looked at the Ouya,
3733000	3739000	but their interface in OS was a piece of shit and a fucking mess the last time I looked at it.
3739000	3747000	They must have done some serious revisions or something because I just don't see how this would be even worth it.
3747000	3753000	It's almost to me like getting the Amazon Marketplace on my phone or something like that.
3753000	3760000	I have the standard Google Play Store, or I can use this Amazon one for some reason,
3760000	3763000	even though the same things are on both. I don't know.
3763000	3767000	Didn't you sell your Ouya, or are you still using it as a doorstop?
3767000	3770000	Oh, no, I sold it a long time ago.
3770000	3776000	All right. One more story for you guys about a game that definitely makes people perk up when we talk about it,
3776000	3779000	and that is Portal. Who doesn't love that series?
3779000	3782000	Will there ever be a Portal 3, I wonder?
3782000	3785000	That's not what this story is about, but it just makes me openly wonder.
3785000	3786000	Valve can't count to three.
3786000	3788000	Yeah, Valve can't count to three.
3788000	3794000	However, we will talk about another way you can experience the joy and wonder of the Portal universe,
3794000	3796000	and that is through a board game.
3796000	3800000	We don't talk about board games enough on this show, but board games are pretty sweet.
3800000	3805000	Most of them. There's a few stinkers out there, I'm sure, but I bet this will be a lot of fun.
3805000	3808000	It's the Portal board game coming from Valve and Cryptozoic.
3808000	3811000	It is supposed to be hitting shelves a little later this year.
3811000	3813000	They don't have a final title yet.
3813000	3819000	The working title is Portal Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game, which sounds good to me.
3819000	3823000	I mean, it makes sense, and obviously everybody gets the joke with the cake and so forth.
3824000	3833000	Apparently, in the game, even though they say cooperative in the title, it's very uncooperative, as the title says.
3833000	3841000	It's very competitive where you play from two to four players, and you actually play as a test subject in a test environment,
3841000	3846000	and you try to either kill off your opponent's pawns, or you might get yourself killed.
3846000	3850000	Now, you do cooperate once in a while if you're trying to kill somebody else.
3850000	3856000	So, there might be that whole, like, oh, Jamie and I are gonna team up to take Matt out, but then we have to turn on each other.
3856000	3859000	So, there'll be some of that diabolical gameplay.
3859000	3863000	I don't know what you're talking about. Prepare for deadly neurotoxin.
3863000	3869000	So, and yeah, I don't know if this is what the game looks like there, that we're looking at a little picture here in studio,
3869000	3873000	but that looks kind of cool, like it's got an isometric sort of look to it.
3873000	3877000	I wonder if it'll actually be like a three-dimensional kind of board. So, we'll see.
3877000	3881000	But yeah, you can check that out a little later this year on the Portal board game.
3881000	3883000	Would you check out a Portal board game, Dark Soccer?
3883000	3884000	I might.
3884000	3885000	I might? Alright.
3885000	3893000	Alright, well, in the meantime, Dark Soccer's gonna go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, this is a classic game.
3893000	3895000	This time I'm riding a bicycle through the vault.
3895000	3897000	That's right. Oh, you're gonna get on your bike and ride through the vault.
3897000	3898000	Yep.
3898000	3899000	She's getting her prop cycle on, yo.
3899000	3902000	No, no, no. Not a prop cycle. This is a bike. Remember, we're old school.
3902000	3903000	That wasn't the game of the week.
3903000	3905000	And I'm running over people's lawns.
3905000	3906000	Oh, I think I know where this is going.
3906000	3911000	And throwing things through their windows and being chased out by dogs and people break dancing and cars.
3911000	3913000	Have you guys figured out where the classic game of the week is going?
3913000	3918000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3918000	3921000	It's Paperboy. Yay.
3921000	3922000	Yay.
3922000	3927000	Yeah. Um, I love the music in Paperboy so much.
3927000	3931000	Like this music right here, right after you select the level.
3931000	3934000	I have to, we have to hear this.
3934000	3938000	Which I just want to say for the people that end up seeing this on YouTube later on,
3938000	3942000	because we do put all our shows up on YouTube as well at username OrangeLawnsRadio.
3942000	3947000	The person who recorded this Playboy playthrough is like totally cheating.
3947000	3950000	Hacks left, look, he's riding through fences and through houses.
3950000	3951000	Yeah.
3951000	3952000	He is the hacking.
3952000	3954000	Got it because it has the music.
3954000	3958000	Yeah, this is not very classic gameplay, but at least it is classic music.
3958000	3961000	Yeah, because I like being able to find the arcade music.
3961000	3963000	And this is the longest one I could find.
3963000	3965000	It didn't have people fucking talking over it.
3965000	3968000	Hey, look at me, I'm playing Paperboy.
3968000	3970000	Boy, I'm terrible at this game.
3970000	3973000	Anyway, you play as a boy delivering paper.
3973000	3977000	So you have to deliver the newspapers to your subscribers,
3977000	3981000	vandalize the non-subscribers home, and still avoid all the hazards.
3981000	3986000	And you lose your subscribers by missing your delivery or damaging your subscriber's house.
3986000	3987000	So you have three levels of difficulty.
3987000	3990000	You have easy street, middle road, and hard way.
3990000	3992000	Which, I just thought of the name.
3992000	3993000	You know, we're clever.
3993000	3997000	So you have to perfectly deliver the papers to your subscribers for an entire week and not crash.
3997000	3999000	Which will eat up alive.
3999000	4001000	And that's before the week ends.
4001000	4004000	And so you have seven in-game days.
4004000	4006000	You have Monday through Sunday.
4006000	4008000	I guess you get the Sunday paper too.
4008000	4012000	So, the houses are really easy to tell apart.
4012000	4016000	Your subscribers look like they have regular houses.
4016000	4021000	Your non-subscribers have red windows and black houses.
4021000	4023000	And they're kind of creepy looking.
4023000	4025000	And you have really weird neighbors.
4025000	4028000	Like, really weird people in the neighborhood.
4028000	4036000	So you have, as far as your hazards, you have fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboards, drunks,
4036000	4042000	kids with radio-controlled toys, and then you have a tornado, oversized house cats, and the grand reaper.
4042000	4047000	You also have to cross intersections that have motorcycles and cars going through.
4047000	4052000	And then, you can actually throw your papers, though, at some of the people.
4052000	4055000	Like the people fighting in the street and the break dancer.
4055000	4057000	And you get extra points for doing that.
4057000	4060000	And you have to pick up more stacks of papers as you go.
4060000	4069000	A perfect delivery is when you deliver to all of your subscriber and you get double points for each house that you deliver to.
4069000	4072000	If you get a perfect delivery.
4072000	4077000	You also have a training course at the end that basically lets you practice doing stuff in different levels.
4077000	4081000	And then you get a recap of your delivery.
4081000	4084000	The chatters are calling me out saying I called this game Playboy.
4084000	4085000	Did I call this game Playboy?
4085000	4086000	I didn't pay attention.
4086000	4087000	I meant to say Paperboy.
4087000	4089000	But you know what?
4089000	4094000	If it was a topless girl riding a bike, that would be something to play, too.
4094000	4097000	That would be BMX XXX.
4097000	4100000	I guess y'all know where my mind was at.
4100000	4115000	So anyway, when you get anything happening in the game, you get an actual paper that shows your little Paperboy guy on it.
4115000	4118000	Like if you do perfect, Paperboy wins an award for outstanding paper delivery.
4118000	4125000	If you lose all your lives, you get one that says Paperboy calls it quits.
4125000	4129000	And if you lose all your subscribers, you get a headline that says Paperboy fired.
4129000	4131000	With a digital voice going you're fired.
4131000	4134000	And there's different voice clips in the game, too.
4134000	4141000	There's one that says Paperboy stopped me at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism.
4141000	4146000	And then you get the list you hang ten when you run into a skateboarder.
4146000	4151000	And then when you run over tricyclists, he says I hate that kid.
4151000	4160000	So it's running on the Atari System 2 hardware with a 10 megahertz digital equipment corporation T11.
4160000	4167000	And sound and coin, it's 2.2 megahertz MOS technology 6502.
4167000	4169000	And the sound chips are pokies.
4169000	4174000	Same hardware. This is clearly the same hardware that ran 720.
4174000	4178000	Texas Instruments TMS-5220 for the speech.
4178000	4181000	One of the Indiana Jones games was on this hardware, too.
4181000	4182000	Yeah, I think so.
4182000	4186000	And there's another one. Is it Rolling Thunder?
4186000	4188000	There's another one I can't think of.
4188000	4198000	Well, at any rate, there is also a bug where you can skirt the finish line at the end of the training course.
4198000	4201000	And play the training course over and over again until you crash.
4201000	4204000	And so you get garbage data on the screen and you get a huge F-score.
4204000	4207000	So that is a glitch in the game.
4207000	4213000	There's different ports. We had the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.
4213000	4220000	And that one, some of those different versions you can actually play as a paper girl instead of a paper boy.
4220000	4221000	Which is awesome.
4221000	4224000	There's a Commodore 64 version. There's a Commodore 16.
4224000	4228000	And yes, I played the shit out of the Commodore 64 version as a kid since you wanted to know.
4228000	4229000	Okay.
4229000	4234000	Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Apple II, TRS-80.
4234000	4236000	God damn it, I lost my page.
4236000	4248000	There was a DOS version, Apple IIGS, the Famicom NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari Lynx, which I have that version.
4248000	4252000	Sega Master System Game Gear and Mega Drive slash Genesis.
4252000	4258000	The NES version is the first NES game to be developed in the US.
4259000	4264000	There were home versions that spawned sequels like Paperboy II.
4264000	4270000	And then there was a Paperboy 64 for the Nintendo 64.
4270000	4279000	It's currently been included in Midway Arcade Treasures and on various systems for the GameCube, PS2, PSP, Xbox and Windows.
4279000	4280000	There's a mobile version out.
4281000	4288000	Paperboy had a release on Xbox Live Arcade for the 360 on February 14th, 2007, but it's been delisted.
4288000	4293000	There is an anniversary version that came out on iOS on December 18th.
4293000	4298000	So the Paperboy appeared in an episode of Captain N.
4298000	4300000	Which, okay.
4300000	4308000	There's a scene in Police Academy 3 back in training where the game is featured.
4308000	4317000	There is a, the game is on a BBC TV show called First Class.
4317000	4320000	And the Paperboy is in Wreck-It Ralph.
4320000	4322000	He's hanging out at Game Central Station.
4322000	4323000	Oh really?
4323000	4324000	Yes.
4324000	4325000	I missed that.
4325000	4326000	So there you go.
4326000	4327000	Alright, that's a good one.
4327000	4329000	I remember this game very fondly.
4329000	4330000	I love the music.
4330000	4331000	Want to hear a little more here?
4331000	4332000	Yeah, let's hear some more.
4338000	4341000	See, see, this is how I do the frickin' hearse.
4341000	4343000	I told you the guy was cheating in this video.
4343000	4345000	He's cheating like crazy.
4345000	4348000	It's kind of got a little Playboy vibe in the video.
4348000	4349000	In the soundtrack.
4349000	4351000	He's playing it alright.
4351000	4352000	Alright, there it is.
4352000	4353000	Your classic game of the week.
4353000	4355000	Paperboy.
4355000	4356000	On everything.
4356000	4358000	In the 80s, honestly.
4358000	4359000	But started in the arcade.
4359000	4361000	There you go.
4361000	4362000	Good pick, Tarsaka.
4362000	4363000	Good pick.
4363000	4364000	Thank you.
4364000	4365000	Hey, we'll be right back.
4365000	4366000	We're going to take a break.
4366000	4367000	We'll be right back after this break.
4367000	4371000	The SEG is going to be here to talk all about that game we were mentioning earlier in the
4371000	4373000	show, releasing this week.
4373000	4374000	Dominique Pamplemousse.
4374000	4377000	We're going to get all the facts on that game.
4377000	4379000	And if I should keep saying it that way, maybe I shouldn't.
4379000	4381000	And, of course, rapid fire news.
4381000	4385000	The Fugu question of the week and plenty more when we come back after this with more of
4385000	4387000	Orange Lawn's radio.
4387000	4397000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4397000	4404000	We are live, of course, on this Sunday evening with episode number, I think I actually might
4404000	4405000	have lost count.
4405000	4406000	What episode number are we on tonight?
4406000	4412000	We're on episode number 543 of our show for this March the 9th of 2014.
4413000	4417000	And Loki, of course, joining us on the Skype line, right?
4417000	4418000	Hopefully he's back.
4418000	4419000	I don't know.
4419000	4421000	He might have went AFK for a baby.
4421000	4422000	No, no, I'm here.
4422000	4423000	I'm sorry.
4423000	4424000	Oh, hey.
4424000	4425000	How's it going, Loki?
4425000	4426000	Going all right.
4426000	4429000	So I know those of you guys who listen to the podcast don't really get to see this side
4429000	4430000	of things.
4430000	4434000	But in studio, we always take a quick break so that we can do things like use the bathroom,
4434000	4435000	top off our drinks, and so forth.
4435000	4439000	Or in the case of tonight's show, set up an interview, which I'm going to get to and get
4439000	4440000	here in two seconds.
4440000	4445000	But I literally was running back with like 15 seconds left to spare.
4445000	4450000	And now I've knocked over the iPad and I barely got the recording of the show started and
4450000	4451000	all that stuff.
4451000	4453000	But that's how we do it live here at OLR, right?
4453000	4454000	Rob, Rob, Rob.
4454000	4455000	What?
4455000	4456000	What?
4456000	4457000	Fix it.
4457000	4458000	I'm trying.
4458000	4461000	And now this stupid iPad keeps locking up on me and I'm going to lose our guest if I'm
4461000	4462000	not careful.
4462000	4465000	Well, you know, somebody else could be talking while you get the little magnet attached.
4465000	4466000	All right.
4466000	4467000	Well, there we go.
4467000	4471000	And we can finally get to our interview that we're going to start off with here at the
4471000	4474000	top of our program for this Part B.
4474000	4478000	And joining us on the line tonight is our pal, the Seg.
4478000	4479000	Shucks.
4479000	4480000	Howdy.
4480000	4481000	How are you all doing?
4481000	4482000	Good.
4482000	4483000	How are you doing, Seg?
4483000	4484000	Good to hear from you.
4484000	4485000	I'm doing rather fine.
4485000	4487000	Tired and a little stressed out, but otherwise.
4487000	4488000	Stressed out?
4488000	4489000	You?
4489000	4490000	How could you be stressed?
4490000	4493000	You talk like it's a game release week or something.
4493000	4496000	I know, right?
4496000	4497000	So, yeah.
4497000	4498000	Oh, my gosh.
4498000	4503000	Who would be releasing a game against Titanfall, Seg?
4503000	4510000	Well, Dalek actually is releasing a game on Tuesday.
4510000	4513000	But also me and Deidre.
4513000	4515000	No, all kidding aside.
4515000	4516000	All kidding aside, come on.
4516000	4520000	There's always, you know, there's always these big, big AAA games coming out.
4520000	4524000	Like, you know, your South Park last week, your Titanfall and your Final Fantasy X, you
4524000	4526000	know, in a couple weeks and so forth.
4526000	4529000	But let us not forget the indie games.
4529000	4531000	Because the indie games, you know, they come out.
4531000	4534000	And sometimes indie games, they take a little while to build, right?
4534000	4536000	Minecraft wasn't built in a day.
4536000	4538000	And some of these indie games become gigantic.
4538000	4539000	I don't know.
4539000	4540000	There's some stuff in Minecraft that's been built in a day.
4540000	4541000	I guess that's very true.
4541000	4545000	But, no, you've got an indie game that you've been kind of assisting with.
4545000	4546000	I'm not sure.
4546000	4548000	What is your official title with it?
4548000	4553000	Well, official title, Deidre came up with this, and I really like it, is Professional
4553000	4554000	Extrovert.
4554000	4555000	Appropriate.
4555000	4556000	Appropriate.
4556000	4567000	So, my role is basically biz dev, community management, build, distribution, release,
4567000	4571000	and all the other things for releasing Dominique Palpemuse.
4571000	4573000	Tell us a little bit about Dominique Palpemuse.
4573000	4580000	So, Dominique Palpemuse is a detective noir point-and-click adventure musical done in
4581000	4584000	stop-motion animation about gender and the economy.
4584000	4585000	Okay.
4585000	4591000	You realize there's going to be a bunch of people out there saying, literally what?
4591000	4593000	Yeah.
4593000	4602000	So, this is a project that, like two years ago now, Deidre set up as an Indiegogo project
4602000	4606000	of just, hey, I want to do a thing.
4606000	4609000	And the budget was very modest.
4609000	4617000	I mean, I want to say it got just a shy over 10K in total, which, you know, it's a video
4617000	4618000	game, folks.
4618000	4621000	That's very, very inexpensive.
4621000	4631000	And made this game that was done in all stop-motion animation, where Deidre did everything.
4631000	4642000	The writing, music, the programming, and it's all stop-motion of real figures and sets
4642000	4643000	that Deidre made.
4643000	4649000	So, it's all pictures and done in black and white.
4649000	4654000	So, it has a very unique, a very, I'll say, raw.
4654000	4659000	It's not the kind of polish you would normally see in a triple-A title.
4659000	4664000	You know, it's very, it has a very unique look to it.
4664000	4670000	When you say stop-motion, I mean, if you think about stop-motion animation, that means literally
4670000	4675000	like click, take a picture, okay, move just a little slight bit, click, take another picture,
4675000	4676000	move a slight bit.
4676000	4679000	I mean, that is an extraordinary amount of patience for one person.
4679000	4685000	And stop-motion, I don't think you really see that in, what video games out there had stop-motion,
4685000	4686000	maybe like Clay Fighter?
4686000	4687000	Yeah.
4688000	4691000	There were some, I think there was one game that had a sort of stop-motion thing.
4691000	4695000	But honestly, the whole idea of a stop-motion game just sounds fantastic to me.
4695000	4696000	Yeah.
4696000	4700000	Because I like, and this was something I've been trying to incorporate in my own personal design,
4700000	4705000	is incorporating real-life textures and objects in a digital environment.
4705000	4708000	And this just hit all of my happy buttons, so.
4708000	4715000	That's astounding, this stop-motion game that literally one person, it's a one-person show, essentially.
4715000	4716000	Yeah.
4716000	4717000	As far as the creation goes.
4717000	4718000	It's all Deidre.
4718000	4719000	Oh, that's amazing.
4719000	4721000	It's done a wonderful job.
4721000	4728000	And so, it actually, you know, technically this game's already been released.
4728000	4737000	But it was on dominicpalpamuse.com, which you can buy it now and I'll get to where it gets new in a moment.
4737000	4739000	And you know you're going to have to spell that.
4739000	4740000	Just saying.
4740000	4741000	Yeah.
4741000	4750000	If you, you know, our SEO's pretty good, where if you make a good attempt at the spelling, I'd know that it's two words.
4750000	4752000	Okay.
4752000	4755000	You're pretty good to go.
4756000	4769000	So, the game was released just through app, iPad, you know, through the app store, and just a simple payment service thing on the website.
4769000	4778000	And then Deidre submitted it to the festival circuit, and first it got digital selection for Indiecade,
4779000	4786000	which is a really nice festival that happens in L.A., Culver City.
4786000	4796000	And I helped out and came along with them to showcase the game as the professional booth dude for the game.
4796000	4803000	I think I heard somewhere, and I could be wrong, but I thought it was in the news this week that Indiecade was announced as coming to GamerX2 as well, right?
4803000	4806000	Or that Cards Against Humanity was sponsoring something with that?
4806000	4808000	I hope I don't have that mixed up.
4808000	4814000	I haven't heard, but I've been in my own dome of seclusion this past two, three weeks.
4814000	4821000	You've been in the Dominique Pample booth all week trying to get this taken care of. No, that's cool.
4821000	4837000	So, a digital section was showcasing it there, and then Deidre put it to the IGF, Independent Games Festival, which goes along with GDC, Game Developers Conference.
4837000	4848000	And there wasn't just one nomination, or two, or three, but four, including the Sam McNally grand prize, the top prize.
4848000	4850000	That's amazing. Congrats.
4850000	4876000	And they were tied three ways for most nominated title, but the categories that were nominated for it are the Grand McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Narrative, Excellence in Audio, because it is a musical, and the Nouveau Award, which is the Experimental Games category.
4877000	4879000	Get out. An experimental game?
4880000	4903000	And, you know, it is an absolute honor, because we're in the same space as games like Paper Please, and The Yog, and Device Six, and all of these other titles.
4903000	4915000	And just, you know, it's really a testament to the work that Deidre has put into this project, and it's really resonated with people that have played.
4915000	4930000	And so, with that, the morning that the IGF nominations came in, I messaged Deidre, and going, you know, obviously, congratulations.
4930000	4931000	Right.
4931000	4959000	And knowing the impending doom that was coming soon, I offered my services as what we now call professional extrovert, because one of the things I knew that was coming was Steam, because Steam has a tradition of outright offering anyone who has gotten nominated for an IGF, just, we can make money with this.
4959000	4969000	So they offer the distribution on Steam, and I have a little bit of familiarity with releasing games on Steam.
4969000	4973000	You know, sixty-four titles in a row by belt, anyway.
4974000	4975000	Not to.
4975000	4995000	But, okay, so this is how, you pretty much just kind of answered the big question, because there has been some people out there on the interwebs wondering, how come this game, being the super fierce indie that it is, clearly, pretty much all being done by one person, how did this game not do the Steam greenlight, but it's because of the nominations?
4995000	4997000	Yes, it's because of the nominations.
4997000	5011000	You know, we've been through enough of a gauntlet already, and to be at this high of an honor, it's a no-brainer, and always has been a no-brainer for Valve.
5011000	5014000	And it's also opened up other opportunities.
5014000	5017000	For example, we're also with Humble.
5017000	5019000	You know, Humble Bundle Humble.
5020000	5026000	We're not in a bundle, but we have a widget and will be in the store as of Tuesday.
5026000	5031000	Right, so many people forget that Humble has their own store that they're running to where you can get Steam keys if you want and so forth.
5031000	5036000	Yeah, and if you get from Humble, you will get Steam keys.
5036000	5038000	PC and Mac as well, right?
5038000	5040000	Yep, Windows, Mac.
5040000	5042000	No funny business.
5042000	5044000	You get both.
5044000	5059000	And yeah, we're also on iPad, but App Store, there is no dials for us to turn in order to get anything rolled in with that, so it's sadly its own separate thing.
5059000	5072000	Let me ask you some, let me get into some real deep questions about the game, because obviously this game is tackling some pretty interesting subject matter in a very interesting way with the stop motion in the musical.
5072000	5080000	And one of those things that the game is tackling is gender identity, correct? Is an issue that's tackled in the game.
5080000	5085000	So how does one tackle gender identity issues through a video game?
5085000	5093000	Well, you know, I don't want to speak out of turn with Deidre and the work that they're doing.
5093000	5109000	But it's really just, you know, when I play the piece, I see it as Deidre honestly trying to address these issues and experiences that they've had.
5109000	5120000	And putting it, you know, putting it to a game, but in a way that it's not, you know, it's not inaccessible to people.
5120000	5132000	Like, I mean, I fully completely identify as male, 100%, and I'm not put off by this because I know that this is experiences that other people go through.
5132000	5140000	And I am enriched by that because I'm experiencing things that I will never go through and I don't go through.
5140000	5149000	And, you know, I think this is really the point of art is to make something that isn't your experience accessible.
5149000	5158000	You know, you're kind of hitting on the next question I was going to ask because the next thing that I had on my list here is that, you know, the probably the number one audience that listens to our show.
5158000	5172000	And it's no secret that the stereotype of your average gamer is a, you know, late teens, early 20s, white cis male, straight guy, you know, what's in this game for them?
5172000	5177000	But you're kind of, you know, since you're many of those things yourself, you're kind of hitting on it.
5177000	5185000	It's about, I don't want to say storytelling, but it is certainly, I mean, because that sounds like fiction, but it's definitely like...
5185000	5186000	Well, it is fiction.
5186000	5192000	Well, okay, okay. The game is fiction, but you're definitely getting some very non-fictional elements in it, right?
5192000	5200000	Yeah. You know, it's, you know, it's totally a fiction game. It's not autobiographical by any means.
5200000	5201000	Sure.
5202000	5217000	But, you know, it's, you know, this has definitely been the double diamond of promoting because it's such a weird, off-the-radar game in so many different ways.
5217000	5238000	But where I find people have the enjoyment on it are either they personally identify with it or they've had a great experience and it's not what they would normally get from other media.
5238000	5247000	And, you know, I mean, I know we're talking so much about the genders and issues and all that, but it's not like it's beating it over your head, you know?
5247000	5254000	And I think that's a very important point to make as well, is that you know this happens in gaming media all of the time.
5254000	5257000	There's that one thing that we flip and fixate on.
5257000	5258000	Yup.
5258000	5265000	And then, you know, just like gaming media can't get over that one thing that that one guy said at that one conference, and then we like fixate on that, right?
5265000	5276000	But no, I think that's a great kind of thing to put out there is that, you know, the man just said, it's stop motion, it's a musical, it's, you know, there's many different points to this.
5276000	5285000	Now, we'd love to in this industry inevitably compare games to each other, you know, like, oh, Tomb Raider, it's just like Uncharted now, you know, all this stuff, right?
5285000	5291000	But, you know, I'm kind of looking at this game and I'm going, can this be compared to anything?
5291000	5294000	Well, it is your traditional point and click adventure game.
5294000	5302000	Straight up. It's, you know, if you like point and click adventures, you're going to feel at home with this.
5302000	5305000	You know, it is that, that's the style.
5305000	5322000	So, you know, that's where it comes with similarities if I was doing the elevator pitch for it, if I was getting a publishing deal, is that it's point and click adventure, but, you know, in a traditional sense.
5322000	5323000	Okay.
5323000	5343000	But it's just the content matter is definitely not what you would normally get from most other works and, you know, we are all so blessed to be able to reach this kind of audience.
5343000	5351000	Both, you know, first of all, thankful for the backers that funded this to make this happen.
5351000	5354000	And really, that was all, that was going to be it.
5354000	5363000	You know, the submission to the festival circuit was, you know, a given and it's just like, you know, the game's done, here you go.
5363000	5365000	Fill out some forms.
5365000	5383000	But now it's just breathed new life into this because there's so much of an interest with it and such positive response from the criticism world that we're, you know, we're able to do these opportunities.
5383000	5396000	Now, Deidre is currently a grad student at University of California Santa Cruz under the Center for Games and Playable Media and is focused doing that.
5396000	5399000	Wait, so on top of making this game, Deidre is a student.
5399000	5408000	Deidre finished this just before or just about starting grad school.
5408000	5410000	Okay. Wow.
5411000	5415000	They'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but that's about the timeline.
5415000	5423000	So the game was done around the time if not before starting at Santa Cruz.
5423000	5424000	Wow.
5424000	5433000	But now it's, you know, if I didn't come along, I'm not trying to sound self-important, but if I didn't come along or someone like me didn't come along for Deidre,
5434000	5445000	I don't think we would be seeing this kind of release because it's a lot of work and, I mean, it's a lot of work for me and I know what I should be doing.
5445000	5455000	Tell me quickly here, I'm going to get to this in a minute here, we're actually going to give away a couple copies of the game just to find people that are listening and we'll get to that in a minute.
5455000	5466000	But I want to know too first quickly, I don't have a whole lot of time left to say because he very agreeably agreed to do a last minute interview here tonight so I've got to kind of wrap up things quick.
5466000	5471000	But if you guys have questions, live.vognetwork.com, you can always, you know, fire as well.
5471000	5477000	You guys are on Twitter, I'm sure you'd be happy to answer questions there or through the website and so forth.
5477000	5483000	I want to ask though real quick before we get to the giveaway and the pimpage and all that of where to get the game.
5483000	5489000	Music, obviously music is a big part of this game. What is some of the music like in the game?
5489000	5496000	Actually, I'm sorry we didn't prepare this, can you call up the website and play the trailer? It's less than a minute.
5496000	5499000	I think that would be a very good thing.
5499000	5505000	If I can remember how to spell it, oh wait no, luckily I have your Twitter, I have it in my history.
5505000	5507000	Guess who now has it on her iPad.
5507000	5508000	That was quick.
5508000	5510000	Yay!
5511000	5513000	Hey, you sold at least one.
5513000	5515000	Just the giant trailer here on the page?
5515000	5516000	Yeah, just play it, play it.
5516000	5518000	Alright, here you go. I'm going to play this here for you guys.
5518000	5520000	Pimple Mouse.
5520000	5522000	It's Pamplemousse.
5522000	5524000	Are you a boy or a girl?
5524000	5525000	No, I'm a detective.
5525000	5530000	It's just a pile of mail, a bunch of bills I haven't paid.
5530000	5535000	I can't believe the lights still turn on in this place.
5536000	5541000	Casey Bingham? I've sort of heard of him, I think.
5541000	5545000	He's a singer and he's like, you know, cute and stuff?
5545000	5549000	Uh, suffice to say, he can't be easily replaced.
5554000	5564000	God, search the room, try to find something that'll tell me something about what's going on with Devon and this thing she's got with Casey Bingham.
5566000	5568000	See it? That's the trailer.
5568000	5574000	This is very, like, I mean this in a nice way. It's not going to sound nice, but it's very odd.
5574000	5577000	Yeah, it is odd. You know, like, good odd.
5577000	5582000	It's odd in that Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Animation Festival kind of way. Does that make sense?
5582000	5588000	Yeah. You know, I don't think it would be that kind of fitting there, but it's odd.
5588000	5593000	It is a completely different experience from what it used to.
5593000	5598000	And, you know, we also have a demo of the game.
5598000	5604000	It's in Flash at our website too, so you can play that as well.
5604000	5609000	I know it's in Flash, but, you know, in browser demo.
5609000	5612000	There you go. Yeah, exactly. You gotta embrace that however you can.
5612000	5616000	Quick question from RageNator in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5616000	5620000	I don't know if you know the answer to this because I know you didn't design, but I'm going to try you anyway.
5620000	5625000	What was the motivation to have the game be a point-and-click game as opposed to be a platformer?
5625000	5630000	So maybe just, like, why, if you know, why did Deidre go point-and-click with it?
5630000	5638000	Well, I don't want to speak definitively. However, no.
5638000	5646000	So Deidre is very active in the IF community, that's interactive fiction community.
5646000	5651000	Worked at Hothead for a while. Was an intern at Telltale. Actually, here's an interesting story.
5651000	5659000	Deidre was an intern at Telltale and done with the internship a month before I started at Telltale.
5659000	5664000	But we didn't meet until that year GDC.
5664000	5668000	So it's like two people who went to the same high school that never met each other till, like, after college.
5668000	5670000	Yes, exactly.
5670000	5672000	That's funny.
5672000	5677000	So, of course, if Deidre was at Telltale, like, there's definitely that exposure, right?
5677000	5678000	Yeah.
5678000	5679000	So, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
5679000	5688000	There's also a piece they did earlier that's also on Deidre's website, the link is towards the bottom,
5688000	5696000	called Life Flashes By, which is another point-and-click adventure, 2D animation, not a musical.
5696000	5701000	But that's completely free and available too, so that's available.
5701000	5712000	So it's definitely not anywhere outside of the realm of their development and experience.
5712000	5714000	Gotcha, gotcha.
5714000	5721000	Alright, well, Seg, we're gonna have to wrap up here, but I do want to allow folks an opportunity to check out Dominique Pumblemoose for themselves.
5721000	5729000	If you would like to, we're gonna do two contests here on the show to win some codes for the game, which is, these are Humble codes, right?
5729000	5734000	These are Humble Bundle codes, which also include the Steam key with it.
5734000	5739000	Okay, so that ought to be accessible to everybody, unless you really wanted it on iPad.
5739000	5743000	But if you want it on iPad, go get it on iPad, it's available right now, which Dark Soccer just did.
5743000	5746000	I did, and $5 is not a whole lot to pay for a good game.
5746000	5747000	Nope, not at all.
5747000	5754000	So, if you would like to get one for free, however, we're gonna give one away to our live folks and one away to our podcast folks.
5754000	5763000	So if you would like to win a copy through the podcast, and this is only through the podcast listeners, send an email right now to participate at orangelaunceradio.com
5763000	5766000	and just say somewhere in there, I want Dominique Pumblemoose!
5766000	5773000	And we'll choose just one, we'll just do a good old random draw, and we'll let you know who won in two weeks when we're back with an all-new Orange Lawns Radio.
5773000	5777000	For those of you that are live, I'm gonna see if you were paying attention.
5777000	5779000	And I'm gonna have you answer a little question.
5779000	5781000	So here's the question, and you gotta answer it.
5781000	5789000	How many awards, how many awards is Dominique Pumblemoose up for at the IGF Awards?
5789000	5794000	You can send your message over private message to Skye in the chatroom, S-K-I-E.
5794000	5800000	And first person to get that in there with the correct answer will win their very own Humble Key for Dominique Pumblemoose.
5800000	5804000	Now, Seg, before I let you go, please, commence the pimpage.
5804000	5807000	How can people get more of this game? What's the website and all that good stuff?
5807000	5809000	The website is DominiquePumblemoose.
5809000	5814000	If you make your best guess at Googling that, it will probably show up.
5814000	5819000	Just know that it's two words. And it will show up.
5819000	5827000	Actually, the thing is, even though our big release day is Tuesday, you can go to the website and just buy it from Humble right now.
5827000	5834000	Sneak peek, you guys! Early release exclusive for OLR listeners, wink wink nudge.
5834000	5846000	Oh, that's right! There's going to be Steam trading cards for Pumblemoose.
5846000	5856000	And some unique emoticons. It's all the characters' faces as emoticons.
5856000	5865000	And there's a rare drop. There's two rare drops. One of which is the cartoon version of Deidre, their face.
5865000	5868000	And one is the cartoon face of yours truly.
5868000	5870000	Nice!
5870000	5878000	So the whole Steam trading card thing is out there. I had to do that art too.
5878000	5881000	I've been doing all the support art and everything.
5882000	5885000	I don't sleep ever.
5885000	5894000	Oh, and one more thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have that many details because they haven't really published them out.
5894000	5905000	But the IGF and GDC awards, they go back to back, literally in the same room, will be streamed on GameSpot.com this following Wednesday.
5905000	5907000	So not this week, but next week Wednesday.
5908000	5915000	And it will be streamed 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.
5915000	5930000	And you can see us waiting in the wings and seeing our fate for all the IGF and Game Choice awards that are right after.
5930000	5934000	Alright, well don't be too nervous when you have to go up there and accept some awards.
5934000	5936000	I imagine Deidre will be doing most of that.
5936000	5938000	Yeah, it's all Deidre.
5938000	5942000	You get to stand behind Deidre and just, you know, thumbs up. Hey!
5942000	5945000	That's the suit. Talk to me for business.
5945000	5949000	Alright, by the way, For the Fallen Dreams, our winner there in the chat room.
5949000	5953000	For the Fallen Dreams with the correct answer of 4.
5953000	5957000	Like seriously, like one second ahead of ActDeft.
5957000	5961000	And then we had some other people that submitted some incorrect answers. I'm sorry guys.
5961000	5969000	But good attempt, good attempt. So I will get, I got For the Fallen Dreams' email and I will get you in touch with them so you can get that code on over.
5969000	5977000	And then if you didn't win tonight, if your name is not For the Fallen Dreams and you didn't win tonight, you do still have that opportunity through Participate at OrangeDawnTreaty.com.
5977000	5981000	We will pull a random emailer in two weeks. So.
5981000	5982000	Cool.
5982000	5985000	Awesome. Segg, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. Best of luck.
5985000	5988000	Thank you. This really means a lot to me.
5988000	5990000	It means a lot to me that you would come on this show.
5990000	5996000	You know, the press is hard. And especially when you have to do everything else too.
5996000	6000000	Hey, I always say, indies gotta look out for each other.
6000000	6009000	And that's, I know I'm usually saying that in the context of indie podcasting, but that is so true about indie video gaming and the media as well.
6009000	6013000	We gotta stick together. So I'm really glad we could help bring a little awareness towards such a title.
6013000	6018000	I'm not sure people would have heard of otherwise necessarily. So you know what? There you go.
6018000	6025000	There you go. So, all right. Well, Segg, again, best of luck and take a nap this weekend. You earned it.
6025000	6030000	After Tuesday, I'll be able to nap and then GDC happens. Oh, God.
6030000	6034000	All right. All right, buddy. Take care. Thank you so much for being here. Have a...
6034000	6035000	Yep, you too.
6035000	6036000	All right.
6036000	6037000	Goodbye, O.O.I.
6037000	6038000	Goodbye.
6038000	6039000	Bye.
6039000	6044000	All right. Always wonderful to hear from Segg here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6044000	6048000	That was great. And especially for coming on at such last minute notice and giving a nice little interview there.
6048000	6051000	Dark Sakura gonna check out the game, let us know what she thinks.
6051000	6057000	Yeah, except I have to play it all at home because I can't take this to the land of cubes and tech.
6057000	6065000	Segg, by the way, is over in our chat room now if you had another question that you weren't able to get in over at live.vognetwork.com.
6065000	6071000	Meanwhile, we've got some rapid fire news to jump into here as we get more into part B of our show.
6071000	6073000	Loki, how you doing? You ready for some news?
6073000	6074000	Sure.
6074000	6076000	Go for it.
6076000	6082000	Okay. So, Titanfall, this is coming out, of course, on Tuesday.
6082000	6091000	And they've already said, hey, you know, we understand that early copies do get out there and we're not gonna ban players because of that.
6091000	6096000	They're saying, you know, about playing early, we're not gonna stop you or ban legit copies.
6096000	6101000	It's pre-launch so there may be interruptions in the service as we prep servers.
6101000	6107000	Also, the servers don't go live until 12.01 a.m. on the 11th in the local time.
6107000	6115000	So, I don't know how much you're gonna be able to play an online game when the servers aren't online.
6115000	6120000	Yeah, it's not gonna do much good to get an early copy of a multiplayer game for which there's no servers.
6120000	6129000	Well, I don't know, the servers still might be up right now because I was like reading a GAF forum post earlier and there's some people capturing footage for multiplayer games and stuff.
6129000	6137000	So, maybe they are testing them still but, you know, definitely you're gonna get in trouble if you start streaming that stuff.
6137000	6147000	And then also, of course, you know, you can preload it on Origin if you want to do the PC version. It's 50 gigabytes. That's ridiculous.
6147000	6149000	That is gigantic.
6149000	6160000	Yeah. And then, of course, in GameStop fashion, you may well be aware that the PlayStation 4 cameras are pretty impossible to find.
6160000	6167000	Well, just like anything else that's hard to find at GameStop, they decided to go ahead and raise the retail price on that.
6167000	6172000	So, no longer will you find it for $59.99 but you can get it for now $69.99.
6173000	6183000	So, that kind of is annoying. But I guess they're well within the right to do that. Of course, I'm also well within my right to not shop there.
6183000	6189000	Yeah. You guys know I've really been trying to get a PlayStation 4 camera and I kind of gave up.
6189000	6193000	And although I'm like, yay, they're in stock again, this just pisses me off.
6193000	6200000	Like, why is GameStop the only store getting these just so they can turn around and fuck people by doing this? This is ridiculous.
6200000	6205000	I don't need a camera that bad. Like, Iamoverit.com. I am over it officially.
6208000	6213000	And then, last but not least, there's some pretty cool Humble Undles going on right now.
6213000	6220000	Of course, they have a weekly sale that features all these different PopCap games including, you know, for whatever amount you want,
6220000	6227000	Pagle Deluxe, Bejeweled 3, Bookworm Deluxe, Escape, Rose Cliff Island, and Feeding Frenzy 2 Deluxe.
6227000	6232000	And if you pay $6 or more, you get Plants vs. Obvious Game of the Year Edition, Pagle Nights, and Zuma's Revenge.
6232000	6238000	So, that's a pretty good deal there. And all those unlock on Steam or Origin.
6238000	6240000	I did pick that up.
6240000	6241000	You did?
6241000	6249000	Yeah, I did. Why not? Especially these old school PopCap games. I really like them and why not, you know?
6249000	6258000	And then, of course, if you're, you know, there's another one going on as well. Devolver Digital is doing a double debut bundle.
6258000	6264000	And that you can find at hummebundle.com slash devolver.
6264000	6269000	And this one's going towards the Brandon Boyer Cancer Treatment Relief.
6270000	6279000	And if you're not familiar with Brandon Boyer, he's the chairman of the Independent Games Festival and also the site Venus Patrol.
6279000	6288000	And, of course, he was diagnosed with cancer and he's currently trying to get some funding for his treatments.
6288000	6295000	So, going towards that, of course, they have a bundle. It's five games and five indie movies.
6295000	6301000	And with the games, they have Duke Nukem 3D, Megaton Edition, Shadow Warrior, Classic Redux.
6301000	6309000	Also, was it Defense Technica, Mark Echo's Getting Up, Contents Under Pressure, and Cosmic DJ.
6309000	6316000	And then with that, the films Mars, Good Game, Austin High, The Poisoning, and One Couch at a Time.
6316000	6319000	So, it's like some indie films and that kind of stuff.
6319000	6321000	And if you want to get everything, you know, it's ten bucks.
6321000	6324000	Otherwise, you get, you know, just Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior and that kind of stuff.
6324000	6327000	So, check it out.
6327000	6332000	I also see some heartfelt comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6332000	6335000	Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, the Brandon Boyer story is sad.
6335000	6340000	Saig says, Brandon is the best person, which obviously Saig was just talking at length about a lot of this indie stuff.
6340000	6346000	Blackwolf says he got insurance, then got diagnosed with cancer, but it was before ACA went into effect.
6347000	6352000	And so, him just telling his doctor, yeah, I had a stomachache once that gave his insurance company the reason to say,
6352000	6355000	pre-existing condition, pay for it yourself.
6355000	6365000	I guess this has already been looked into, but I thought that pre-existing actually had to come off of plans back in 2011.
6365000	6368000	Or earlier when they first signed the thing into law.
6368000	6370000	I think it was depending on state.
6370000	6373000	Yeah, that might have been it. It might have depended on state.
6373000	6375000	That's really unfortunate.
6375000	6377000	Proof we had a broken system.
6377000	6384000	Yeah, I can't really comment further, but I'm glad to hear that the troops are rallying around them.
6384000	6388000	Alright, well, let's move on. I got some news here.
6388000	6394000	So, we talked about the Humble Bundle a minute ago for PopCap, and speaking of PopCap releases,
6394000	6398000	Pagle 2 is on its way onto the Xbox 360.
6398000	6401000	I don't know if you guys know, but Pagle 2 has been out on Xbox One.
6401000	6405000	But unlike other PopCap games, it hasn't shown up everywhere.
6405000	6411000	Well, that trend will finally break soon. It looks like Xbox 360 will be getting its version on May 7th.
6411000	6419000	There you go. The game costs $12 on Xbox One. It's assumed that's the price on Xbox 360, but we don't know for sure yet.
6419000	6429000	Also, dual mode just launched in the Xbox One version for two players fighting locally over the title of Pagle Master.
6429000	6434000	EA did not announce any other platforms, but they do say they will be bringing it pretty much everywhere.
6434000	6437000	It's just a matter of time.
6437000	6442000	This is interesting that this game is actually getting made.
6442000	6448000	Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn. This has been rumored for weeks and weeks here on the program, but yeah.
6448000	6453000	There is a sequel to Shaq-Fu coming. There's a whole little trailer out there for it.
6453000	6454000	Why?
6454000	6460000	Well, here's the thing. It may or may not actually happen because it's on IndieGoGo.
6460000	6464000	To make the game happen, they will need $450,000.
6464000	6470000	Now, they're a little bit tongue-in-cheek about this. They're not actually claiming that Shaq-Fu was just an amazing thing.
6470000	6476000	But they are saying that Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn is what the original game should have been.
6476000	6479000	So there you go. There's a trailer up if you want to check that out.
6479000	6484000	And just so you know, they've raised $69,000 in change so far.
6484000	6490000	But they do have 42 days left, so there are still a ways in the goal. They're just over 10%.
6490000	6495000	But they do have 42 days left, so that's a lot of time to contribute to Shaq-Fu.
6495000	6500000	I was going to say, fear not though. They're flexible funding, so even if they don't raise that amount, they're going to get your money.
6500000	6504000	Yes, I noticed that was on IndieGoGo and not the other sites.
6505000	6514000	Alright, one other thing here. I did not even know that this was a thing, but apparently the internet has already embraced Goat Simulator.
6514000	6515000	Oh yes.
6515000	6517000	I need this. What is this?
6517000	6520000	Tell me about Goat Simulator, because I honestly don't know much about it.
6520000	6522000	How do you goat?
6522000	6527000	Let's see. Goat Simulator is a game that's by, I'm trying to remember the company now.
6527000	6530000	But basically it started off as like a game jam within their studio.
6530000	6539000	And it was just like this thing, it was just really dumb that they made in Unreal Engine 3.
6539000	6545000	And they posted an internet video of it, and it just took off viral.
6545000	6551000	So yeah, it's Koffenstein Studios, they did, oh god I can't remember the name now.
6551000	6554000	It's really happening y'all, it's really happening.
6554000	6563000	Goat Simulator will be released on April 1st. No fooling, even though that's, I know, appropriate, right?
6563000	6569000	Sadly only available on PC and no multiplayer functionality, but you know what?
6569000	6572000	If it sells really well, I think anything is possible.
6572000	6574000	Ten dollars is the asking price.
6574000	6577000	If you want to go pre-order the game, you can right now.
6577000	6581000	The website is goat-simulator.com.
6581000	6587000	You know, that's really bad because I read that at first as Goat Stimulator, and that's not a game I want to play.
6587000	6589000	You know, I made that joke in the chatroom actually.
6589000	6590000	Oh did you?
6590000	6593000	I said Goat Simulator and then said better than Goat Stimulator.
6593000	6598000	I think for the sake of the show, you should really check out the video.
6598000	6600000	Okay.
6600000	6601000	The trailer that's on there.
6601000	6603000	On their website?
6603000	6604000	On their website.
6604000	6605000	I want a goat.
6605000	6606000	Alright. Here we go.
6606000	6607000	I'm gonna play the goat game.
6607000	6609000	Another video, poor Jason.
6609000	6610000	Poor Jason.
6610000	6611000	Alright, here we go.
6611000	6614000	I'm gonna look at this trailer right now here for Goat Simulator, which I've never seen.
6618000	6619000	Oh my God.
6619000	6621000	This is great.
6621000	6623000	I can't control the volume.
6623000	6626000	You're just flicking the goat everywhere.
6626000	6627000	Butts.
6627000	6628000	Butts.
6628000	6629000	I want to be a goat.
6629000	6632000	More goat, please.
6632000	6633000	Oh my God.
6633000	6636000	You're bouncing a goat around on a trampoline through windows.
6636000	6638000	This, this looks like...
6638000	6640000	This looks like a Loki dream game.
6640000	6644000	It looks like a giant sandbox Grand Theft Auto thing, except the main character is a goat.
6644000	6646000	And you can lick stuff.
6650000	6652000	Alright, now I've seen everything.
6654000	6655000	It's fantastic.
6655000	6658000	Jason said this music makes me feel like I'm drunk.
6658000	6660000	Oh God, alright.
6660000	6663000	And Dungeon Buster says you play as a goat and can katamari things with your tongue.
6663000	6664000	But here's the best part though.
6664000	6668000	They're trying to get Steam, was it Steam Workshop support for it.
6668000	6669000	Oh no.
6669000	6672000	So everybody can put their own things in it.
6672000	6673000	Great.
6673000	6674000	Great.
6674000	6675000	Alright.
6675000	6676000	This is gonna happen.
6676000	6677000	Alright, Dark Soccer.
6677000	6678000	What do you got for us?
6678000	6679000	I have a couple things.
6679000	6683000	First of all is going to be the release date for Watch Dogs.
6683000	6688000	It's gonna be May 27th according to Ubisoft.
6688000	6694000	So they said that the Wii U version could be a few months after the game's release.
6694000	6701000	And then in other news, coming from Retro Studios as soon as it freaking works,
6701000	6706000	is that they're actually saying we'll be lucky to someday return to Metroid.
6706000	6713000	There was an interview with Michael Kelbal that said that they would really like to,
6713000	6717000	and that they're developing a new game since they did the Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze,
6717000	6720000	and that they really, really want to do a Metroid game.
6720000	6723000	The quote is, if the fans keep asking them, maybe we'll answer.
6723000	6726000	That's it.
6726000	6731000	Alrighty, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6731000	6735000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,
6735000	6739000	and we tackle it in the foogle question of the week.
6740000	6743000	Tonight's...
6743000	6745000	I didn't let the music appropriately play.
6745000	6747000	Sorry, I was just in a hurry to tackle our question tonight.
6747000	6749000	Rob, let the music play.
6749000	6750000	Let the music play.
6750000	6751000	He won't get away.
6751000	6752000	Alright.
6752000	6756000	The foogle question of the week has to do with the sponsorship question we were asking earlier
6756000	6760000	between Penzoil and Mario Kart 8.
6760000	6763000	Now, not totally asking what you guys think about it,
6763000	6767000	but we wanted to know what did you think would be an interesting sponsorship
6767000	6770000	or a promotional tie-in between a corporation and a video game.
6770000	6773000	So serious or funny, whatever you want to do there.
6773000	6777000	So here we go. Here are some of the answers from Facebook.
6777000	6782000	Tech 2030 says, what about Boeing branded airships in Final Fantasy?
6782000	6783000	Makes sense.
6783000	6787000	Asfer says, cooking mama, cooking with Paula Deen.
6787000	6791000	The limited edition comes packaged with two sticks of butter, y'all.
6791000	6792000	No.
6792000	6798000	As long as she sticks to, like, two or three canned lines, we're fine.
6798000	6805000	Awesome Unicorn says, I guess they missed the boat to cross-promote Bravely Default
6805000	6809000	by offering subprime lending with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
6809000	6812000	That's a good political joke. That's a good one.
6812000	6815000	I've worked in the mortgage industry when everything popped, so...
6815000	6817000	Yeah.
6817000	6821000	Let's see.
6821000	6828000	Degenerate Johnny says, Depends sponsored underwear and Outlast would be the perfect partnership.
6828000	6834000	Players would not have to worry when they shit themselves during the jump scares.
6834000	6838000	You nasty.
6838000	6839000	I love our listeners.
6839000	6841000	Let's see.
6841000	6846000	Our listeners are like listening to Tumblr without all the social justice.
6846000	6849000	There's some really bad answers coming up here. You ready?
6849000	6850000	More. More.
6851000	6854000	Chiggers says, Mirror's Edge and Dramamine.
6854000	6855000	That's a good one.
6855000	6856000	That would be a good one.
6856000	6857000	Okay.
6857000	6859000	Our good pal, Shane Alinko.
6859000	6861000	Oh, Shane.
6861000	6867000	Warner Brothers could partner with the Red Cross for some fun Mortal Kombat tie-in.
6867000	6871000	You know. No, no, no. Remember.
6871000	6874000	I think it was the Australian Red Cross?
6874000	6875000	Mm-hmm.
6875000	6879000	Teamed up with Konami for that whole Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 promotion.
6879000	6881000	You know when the Saw movies come out.
6881000	6883000	God, no, no, no, no.
6883000	6886000	As much as I hate those movies, they do blood drives for that, too.
6886000	6888000	Because I've had friends that have done that.
6888000	6893000	They should do is like Southwest Airlines in Mortal Kombat.
6893000	6896000	You get over here and Southwest.
6896000	6898000	Get over here and donate.
6898000	6899000	Alright.
6899000	6903000	Let's go to some of the answers over on Google Plus.
6903000	6907000	Which, of course, you can find us at Google.com slash plus.
6907000	6909000	Orange Launch Radio. All one word.
6909000	6910000	Just a few.
6910000	6915000	We didn't have quite the discussion blow up over there on Google Plus tonight.
6915000	6917000	I'm just going to read a couple of these here.
6917000	6924000	Retertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour and Viagra.
6924000	6926000	Some of them don't need it.
6926000	6929000	And lastly, Flaco Jones said,
6929000	6935000	Since they sponsored the TV show, KFC should also sponsor the Walking Deads game.
6935000	6937000	Or the Walking Dead games.
6937000	6943000	But only if they continue to juxtapose images of people eating their food with zombies eating people.
6943000	6946000	Tastes about the same.
6946000	6947000	Yeah, right.
6947000	6949000	Crunchy brain.
6949000	6952000	It's probably made from the same material, too.
6952000	6956000	SSG100 Matt says, Dope War sponsored by Dare.
6956000	6957000	Yeah, I saw that one.
6957000	6958000	That was pretty funny.
6958000	6961000	The Double Down is made of people.
6961000	6963000	People.
6963000	6964000	Charlton Heston presents.
6964000	6966000	Those were only some of the answers.
6966000	6972000	You can read the rest over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6972000	6973000	Meanwhile, we've got more news for you.
6973000	6974000	Loki.
6974000	6975000	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6975000	6976000	What?
6976000	6977000	Act Defted. Have a good one.
6977000	6978000	What?
6978000	6979000	Kirby and Kirby vacuums.
6979000	6980000	Yes.
6980000	6982000	You guys are going to end up reading them all anyway.
6982000	6983000	All right.
6983000	6985000	Loki, what do you got for us?
6985000	6986000	All right.
6986000	6990000	Unfortunately, there's been some layoffs at Sony Santa Monica.
6990000	6995000	Apparently, also along with that, a next gen game cancellation.
6995000	7005000	And basically, they said this is a result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas within SCE-WWS.
7005000	7007000	We do not take these decisions lightly.
7007000	7013000	However, sometimes it's necessary to make changes to better serve the future projects of our studio.
7013000	7020000	And we have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease the transition of those impacted.
7020000	7026000	And they haven't really said, I guess there was supposed to be an unannounced PS4 title in development.
7026000	7037000	But they haven't really said what that was, although they kind of made another comment about it saying that there's not a single business on the planet where every single project that is started is a success.
7037000	7039000	And that's just what happens here.
7039000	7043000	Sometimes high profile projects or studios need a reboot.
7043000	7045000	And that's what happened here.
7045000	7051000	Santa Monica will always have a hugely important part of our global family of studios.
7051000	7056000	It's a huge studio and that's right up there around 200 people even after the recent layoffs.
7056000	7062000	And of course, they're not saying which project we're going on.
7062000	7065000	But I guess they're rebooting everything.
7065000	7069000	Maybe they thought they needed like fresh blood, I guess.
7069000	7074000	I can see them maybe doing like a PlayStation 4 version of God of War or something.
7074000	7078000	Maybe it's just not testing well or something. I don't know.
7078000	7086000	You know, SSG100 Matt in our chat room brings up a good point saying the Order 1886 was being done by Sony Santa Monica.
7086000	7089000	So could that have been an impacted game?
7090000	7096000	It seemed like it was far along from what we were seeing, but I hope it's not that one.
7096000	7101000	I had heard rumors, and you know, again, rumors take it with a huge salt lick.
7101000	7107000	But they had a game that was very similar to Destiny that was in the making.
7107000	7114000	And that unfortunately, Destiny was looking like a better game to make a long story extremely short.
7114000	7116000	And that was the cause.
7116000	7122000	But again, that could have evolved from like a NeoGaf post from somebody's uncle or something.
7122000	7124000	You know, I don't know. So take it with a huge grain of salt.
7124000	7130000	I just hope the Order 1886 is still something that's going to be happening because I like that it's a new IP.
7130000	7135000	It's a little bit different. I think a lot of people are here for the werewolf and steampunk type of thing.
7135000	7142000	I think it's still going to be one because remember, they just got done showing it off at like some Sony press event not too long ago.
7142000	7150000	So I think that's still coming. It's just maybe whatever else they haven't really announced yet that they're working on wasn't panning out.
7150000	7158000	But they're not the only ones. Disney Interactive has also laid off 700 people and they're planning to scale back their annual game output.
7158000	7163000	Which is weird because their annual game output is like one or two games.
7163000	7169000	Well, don't they do a shit ton of mobile? You're thinking of like Disney Infinity and that stuff.
7169000	7176000	Isn't this like their mobile side that does like Where's My Water was one of their big games?
7176000	7179000	I know there's a ton of Disney games on iPhone.
7179000	7190000	Well, I think it's just the whole group. Maybe they are scaling back some of their internet mobile games and that kind of stuff.
7191000	7203000	I don't know. Maybe some of the movie tie-in games are scaling back because I don't really know if they have like scheduled as far as animated features coming out this year.
7203000	7211000	That would make a lot of sense actually because sometimes those tie-in games too, they seem to work with other companies.
7211000	7216000	Like I think of the one that comes to mind is that there was that Tangled Temple Run game.
7216000	7221000	I don't think Disney did that themselves. I think they worked with the creators of Temple Run to make that.
7221000	7227000	Well, yeah, and they also licensed their stuff out like Phineas and Ferb. They had a game that was done by Majesco.
7227000	7236000	There's been other like, you know, I want to say even some of the Cars games weren't necessarily done by Disney at one time.
7236000	7243000	But, I mean, I'm sure we'll see a new Disney Infinity from them this year because I think we've run out of characters as of April.
7243000	7246000	So I'm sure they're going to be announcing something about that soon.
7246000	7254000	And then I don't really expect much more from them. Maybe a couple handheld games. That's about it.
7254000	7260000	Well, our thoughts go out to the impacted workers. I swear to God it's been like three weeks in a row we've been talking layoff stories.
7260000	7264000	So I don't know what gives. I thought things were ticking up for the game industry.
7264000	7268000	But our thoughts are with those impacted and hoping you guys can land somewhere else.
7269000	7270000	Yeah.
7270000	7274000	Maybe Square Enix is hiring. That's the story I'm going to get into next. I don't know.
7274000	7280000	But I know Square Enix is polling people right now to get fan feedback on Kingdom Hearts.
7280000	7288000	Kingdom Hearts polling the fans to see what platforms gamers are currently playing on and what genre people prefer.
7288000	7290000	Now here's something interesting.
7290000	7297000	Kingdom Hearts 3, it's been announced for PlayStation 4, it's been announced for Xbox One, hasn't been announced for Wii U.
7297000	7306000	So this news has been gaining a lot of traction on Nintendo websites to basically go hit the poll and say show Wii U some love.
7306000	7311000	Show them that there is fans out there that want to see Kingdom Hearts on Wii U.
7311000	7319000	So very interesting. I don't know. Again, it's just a poll. I don't know if it'll have that full impact.
7319000	7326000	But it could be very interesting. I just don't think Kingdom Hearts 3, I mean if they're going for the look, it probably can't really be done on Wii U.
7326000	7334000	I hate to say it, but I think they're, you know, again, Wii U is built a little more on the 360 PlayStation 3 with a little more oomph.
7334000	7341000	But I would think that if they know that there's a huge following for Kingdom Hearts on Nintendo, maybe there could be a side story or something.
7341000	7346000	You know, and certainly there was Dream Drop Distance on a Nintendo platform.
7346000	7350000	So it's not like Square Enix is going to say F you to all Nintendo platforms.
7350000	7355000	So you never know what might happen with that. So good luck.
7356000	7358000	Alright, DarkSakura.
7358000	7364000	Well, I have some news. And this is actually going to be more something that I think we need to play for people.
7364000	7370000	There is actually a video out for GamerX2, which is the convention you went to last year.
7370000	7374000	And I'm going to do my best to make it to this year.
7374000	7384000	And it has Ellen McLean, who was GLaDOS in Portal, and John Patrick Lowry, who was the sniper in Team Fortress 2, showing some love for the convention.
7384000	7389000	And I honestly think that it's better just to let it play, but everyone should be supporting it.
7389000	7393000	It's July 11th through 13th at the Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco.
7393000	7395000	And play it.
7395000	7397000	Sure, there's just a couple minutes, so let's take a listen.
7397000	7401000	Who doesn't love the voices of Ellen McLean and John Patrick Lowry?
7401000	7403000	I mean, they could be reading the phone book, and I'd be excited.
7403000	7404000	Yes.
7404000	7405000	But this is much better than a phone book.
7406000	7419000	In a world where gay gamers gather together to get their game on, gamble, gallop, and geek out to giddiness in a great gala of grandeur and glee.
7419000	7422000	Will you be the one to say them nay?
7422000	7425000	Will you be the one to crush their dreams?
7425000	7427000	Will you be the one to say,
7427000	7430000	Oh gee, you don't get a party.
7430000	7433000	Oh gee, you don't deserve a party.
7433000	7438000	Oh gee, why don't you go home and cry in your pillow?
7438000	7443000	Oi, you poop on my party, I'll put a prime pinna on that pumpkinette of yours.
7445000	7447000	Hello.
7447000	7452000	Oh, have you gained a little weight since last we spoke?
7452000	7454000	Well, no matter.
7454000	7458000	The Sniper and I are just having a quiet evening here at home.
7458000	7462000	And we thought we'd say a few words in support of GamerX.
7462000	7466000	It's happening this July in beautiful San Francisco.
7466000	7468000	The city by the bay.
7468000	7475000	Now we certainly wouldn't want to get the impression that we're coercing you into supporting this wonderful gathering.
7475000	7478000	Perhaps you think it's a good idea.
7478000	7480000	Perhaps you don't.
7480000	7490000	Perhaps you're a forward-thinking progressive who feels that all human beings should be able to come together to celebrate themselves and their friends.
7490000	7493000	Or maybe you're a reactionary pig.
7493000	7503000	Either way, we don't want you to think that I would release large quantities of deadly neurotoxin if you don't give generously to GamerX.
7503000	7505000	Look into your hearts.
7505000	7508000	And please give generously.
7508000	7511000	Really generously.
7511000	7513000	I'd hate to get angry.
7516000	7518000	I love her.
7519000	7526000	If you haven't seen the actual YouTube, which you can see over on GamerX's YouTube channel, which is just G-A-Y-M-E-R-X.
7526000	7530000	Just getting to see the video of her doing that voice.
7530000	7532000	With the cute face.
7532000	7535000	She does such little cute faces and things. She's great.
7535000	7540000	Well, there is an ongoing Kickstarter that you can go to.
7540000	7545000	And so far, well, as of the time of the announcement, there's 18 grand scheduled so far.
7545000	7547000	Nice. So they've hit their goal.
7548000	7556000	And basically they said that David Gator from BioWare, basically the dude who's writing Dragon Age, is going to be there.
7556000	7558000	There's a bunch of people there.
7558000	7563000	There's the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, I guess that's how it's pronounced.
7563000	7564000	Just a bunch.
7564000	7567000	And a wrestler, Darren Young.
7567000	7570000	So Bobby Wrestling Chat is going to be there.
7570000	7573000	And so lots of stuff is going on. I really want to go this year.
7573000	7575000	Cards Against Humanity, the huge AAA sponsor this year.
7575000	7576000	I really want to go.
7576000	7580000	Well, I will tell you this, too. On the podcast front, I'm a huge supporter of indie podcasters.
7580000	7585000	And I do network on Facebook with a great group of independent podcasters.
7585000	7587000	Of course, great.
7587000	7589000	Hey, Loki, you all right over there?
7589000	7591000	Yeah, sorry.
7591000	7592000	Breaking out the power tools.
7592000	7594000	All right. Anyway, mid-show.
7594000	7597000	Just some of the other indie podcasts that are going to be there.
7597000	7602000	Obviously, Grandpa from Hoard House and the just announced T'Vog starboard power company.
7602000	7603000	He is going for sure as well.
7603000	7605000	Some other great GLBT podcast.
7605000	7607000	My buddies from Game Buoy.
7607000	7608000	You know I love me.
7608000	7610000	Some Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.
7610000	7611000	They're there as well.
7611000	7614000	Game Bar is going to have some representation.
7614000	7617000	I'm positive Jason's going back this year and maybe his co-host as well.
7617000	7618000	I don't know.
7618000	7620000	I know Koopa Club will be represented.
7620000	7622000	Those guys are going as well.
7622000	7626000	One of the new kids on the block who has an amazing show.
7626000	7627000	Amazing.
7627000	7628000	Donnie Wahlberg?
7628000	7629000	Video.
7630000	7636000	No, this is better than Donnie and Mark put together is video game realness.
7636000	7637000	I know they're trying really hard.
7637000	7639000	They got to come all the way from Canada though.
7639000	7641000	And it's cold up there, y'all.
7641000	7643000	But check at least all those shows out.
7643000	7647000	And yeah, hopefully some of them at GamerX too this year.
7647000	7651000	And there hopefully will be another panel of some sort.
7651000	7653000	That's in the planning as well.
7653000	7655000	So, yeah.
7655000	7656000	I want to go.
7656000	7657000	You should go.
7657000	7658000	If I can.
7658000	7659000	All right.
7659000	7662000	Let's move on.
7662000	7663000	Some more news.
7663000	7664000	Where are we at now?
7664000	7665000	Loki.
7667000	7668000	All right.
7668000	7669000	All right.
7669000	7670000	So let's see.
7670000	7671000	Put away the parrot.
7671000	7672000	Parrot?
7672000	7673000	What parrot?
7673000	7677000	I can't believe that they're actually going to make this.
7677000	7680000	But apparently The Last of Us is going to be a film now.
7680000	7682000	I mean the game was cinematic enough.
7682000	7684000	So I just thought they'd leave it at that.
7684000	7690000	But yes, now they're going to be partnering with Scream Gems, Brian Dukes, and Eric Ling.
7690000	7701000	I guess they're saying that it's going to be written also by basically the team at Naughty Dog.
7701000	7708000	So hopefully that means there'll be a faithful translation of the actual game into movie.
7708000	7714000	Because usually it's kind of not very good.
7714000	7718000	No word, though, on when exactly this is expected to be released.
7718000	7721000	Probably not for a few years, I'm guessing, at this point.
7721000	7724000	Yeah, this has got to be really early on.
7724000	7726000	So.
7726000	7731000	Codeman in our chat says, oh god, the story will be ruined, dammit.
7731000	7732000	Well, we'll see.
7732000	7733000	We'll see.
7733000	7739000	The good news is somebody's got to be the first great video game movie.
7739000	7742000	Maybe it'll be this one.
7742000	7743000	Maybe?
7743000	7745000	Mm-hmm.
7745000	7748000	Hey, this is a video game that maybe they'll turn this into a movie as well.
7748000	7751000	Because this is supposed to have some pretty kick butt writing behind it.
7751000	7757000	It's Quantum Break, which of course is one of the Xbox One exclusive games that we're sure to get a look at later this year.
7757000	7765000	It's developed by the same guys who did Alan Wake, which was really underrated in some ways on the Xbox 360.
7765000	7767000	Great soundtrack and great game.
7767000	7770000	Very Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks.
7770000	7771000	It was really good.
7771000	7775000	But anyway, those developers, they moved on and they're making Quantum Break.
7775000	7776000	Well, this is pretty cool.
7776000	7778000	There's now an Oscar connection.
7778000	7781000	You know, last week our show was up against the Oscars.
7781000	7785000	And I'm sure many of you have read about all the movies that won Oscars by this point.
7785000	7788000	And one of those movies that won quite a few Oscars was Gravity.
7788000	7790000	Gravity didn't win the best picture prize.
7790000	7791000	That was 12 Years a Slave.
7791000	7794000	But Gravity did pick up a lot of technical awards and things of that sort.
7794000	7805000	Well, what's pretty cool is that some visual effects work in the game will be some of the talent that actually made Gravity that won a lot of those VFX Oscars.
7805000	7806000	So that's really cool.
7807000	7815000	They were congratulating Greg Luden on the Remedy Games website for the Oscar that he got for Gravity.
7815000	7822000	And so, yeah, he worked with Gravity's computer-regenerated interiors with the free-floating space objects and so forth.
7822000	7828000	And now he's working on visual effects for Quantum Break and scripting and designing events as level design.
7828000	7838000	So even though we may not have the first great video game that's been turned into a movie, we certainly are seeing movie elements going into video games.
7838000	7841000	I know I for one am very excited about Quantum Break.
7841000	7846000	That's probably what's going to break me eventually and make me get an Xbox One.
7846000	7848000	So I'm very excited about that.
7849000	7850000	All right.
7850000	7852000	Let us get to the mailbag.
7852000	7862000	Every week you guys send us an email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we dive into the mailbag and read some of our favorite emails here on air.
7862000	7865000	And we get very mad at all those emails that you drown us in.
7865000	7866000	Grr, I hate reading.
7866000	7867000	Grr, I hate it.
7867000	7869000	I never learn to read.
7869000	7871000	I hate it when I play the wrong music bumper.
7871000	7872000	Let's try this instead.
7879000	7880000	First email.
7880000	7882000	Dear OLR.
7882000	7884000	Dear emailer.
7884000	7897000	In regards to the discussion last week regarding what video game movies will have to do in order to attain widespread critical recognition, it seems that production companies will have to take a serious look at what source material is chosen.
7897000	7899000	That I agree with right away.
7901000	7908000	Scanning the Wikipedia list of films based on video games, the source material is almost universally fighting action or horror games.
7909000	7915000	These are all types of movies that tend to perform well in the box office and fall short in the major awards season.
7915000	7920000	A problem also arises when considering games that are more story driven such as RPGs.
7920000	7927000	While I would love to see any number of, let's say, Final Fantasy games adapted, the time constraints of a film would be incredibly difficult to overcome.
7928000	7939000	So if big budget action titles, fighters, horror games, sprawling RPGs, and games with effectively no story such as your typical platformer are out, what video game industry darling does that leave us with?
7939000	7941000	That's right, bite-sized indie games.
7941000	7945000	You had touched on this idea a bit mentioning Journey, but how about Papo & Yo?
7945000	7950000	After all, Pan's Labyrinth won three Oscars and was nominated for three more.
7950000	7956000	And To the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won one and was nominated for another. That's a good movie.
7957000	7968000	I know this has been as much to do with the quality of the finished product as it does with the content, but these are games that feature subjects and set pieces that have proven popular with Academy voters.
7968000	7980000	Additionally, if these smaller and more sophisticated stories managed more frequently to get the type of exposure this would bring, it could really stand to improve the reputation of gaming as a whole.
7980000	7987000	Because really, a Call of Duty or GTA movie isn't going to change anyone's mind about anything, no matter how stimulating it may be to watch.
7987000	7995000	Apologies for the lack of any real question beyond something like what indie games have enough story to make a movie, but I just wanted to give my two cents.
7995000	8002000	So I will now look forward to the day when directors stop thinking that making a video game movie means throwing a dart at the top of a list of-
8002000	8004000	At the top of-
8004000	8012000	And tongue tied means throwing a dart at a top ten list of best sellers and start thinking a little smaller and more personal. Until then, stay awesome.
8012000	8014000	And that's from Awesome Unicorn.
8014000	8021000	For that great email, for what it's worth, however, I mean, there is that Minecraft movie and Minecraft did start as an indie game.
8021000	8032000	I mean, I realize it's grown like crazy, but, you know, there is that. And it sounds like they're approaching it the right way if it's going to be like the Lego movie was type of thing.
8032000	8040000	But I do agree with the thought that we don't necessarily always have to think of big budget, like it's got to be like the hot selling games are the only things that are going to make good movies.
8040000	8045000	Because we do have good stories and lots of great video games that might make for a good movie.
8045000	8064000	For the record, I have seen very quality acting coming from those, you know, action and whatever genre that, honestly, if these same actors had been in the indie film or other type of, you know, Oscar-y film, then they would have easily taken the prize. So, I'm just saying.
8064000	8074000	Tiger Claw, reminding us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com that, by the way, the Need for Speed movie comes out on March 14th. I know, because I saw Flaco's article on VOG.
8074000	8078000	It said, who knows, it could actually be good considering the games never really had a story.
8078000	8083000	It's going to be Fast and Furious, the new.
8083000	8089000	Exactly. It's just to hold the Fast and Furious crowd over while they figure out what they're going to do with the next movie.
8090000	8094000	Okay, next email. We have one more after this.
8094000	8103000	Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here. I just wanted to throw in my two cents on the whole Wii and DS Online plug-pull that's going to happen soon.
8103000	8113000	I used to be an employee of GameSpy, now acquired slash defunct, so I don't have to worry about telling you guys this stuff, which is actually the company that hosts all the matchmaking for every single Wii and DS Online titles.
8113000	8117000	Since you guys are near and dear to my heart, I'm giving you guys the exclusive scoop on this.
8117000	8129000	Out of all GameSpy titles that ever existed, including huge games like Borderlands, Mortal Kombat 9, GTA 5, etc., surprisingly the consistently highest traffic title is Mario Kart Wii.
8129000	8136000	Now GameSpy got acquired by Glu Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game company a year or so ago, which is around the time I left the company.
8136000	8142000	So I heard their division isn't doing so well. High turnover, my old manager got pushed out for political reasons.
8143000	8148000	He was a grade A d-bag. And Glu is probably losing money on that acquisition.
8148000	8160000	So I'm guessing that what happened is Glu is trying to cut their losses on the acquisition by either charging a huge amount of money to Nintendo to keep their servers running, enough to justify keeping the engineers to keep the servers maintained at least.
8160000	8165000	Or they straight up wouldn't renew the contract so they could let those engineers go.
8165000	8174000	So either Nintendo wouldn't renew for the higher price, or couldn't renew, and it doesn't make financial sense for them to port all their games to new servers they run in-house.
8174000	8177000	That's why you're seeing Wii and DS titles go offline.
8177000	8182000	I hope this helps shed some light on the reason behind why Nintendo is shutting off their servers.
8182000	8189000	They don't hate their fans, and they're probably not trying to drive everyone to just play 3DS and Wii U, though that's an added bonus.
8189000	8195000	They just don't want to fork the money over to Glu or can't to keep the servers running on a new contract. Here's always AZHP.
8195000	8204000	Thank you for sharing that with us, and I hope you all were paying attention because I think that's it.
8204000	8213000	And it's not just because there might be that insider's perspective or whatever. I think when it's stated like that, it makes a crap ton of sense.
8213000	8214000	Agreed.
8214000	8216000	We're going to have to put a second gold star by his name.
8216000	8219000	Yep. You're our first double gold star recipient.
8219000	8223000	Our first double gold star recipient.
8223000	8224000	One more email?
8224000	8226000	One more email.
8226000	8234000	Hello. This is coming from, um, I'm just going to say Ronnie, because he didn't list a name.
8234000	8235000	Okay.
8235000	8241000	Hello. I have been a listener since the live 365 days, and I really enjoy the show. This is my first email, and I'm about to start college soon.
8241000	8246000	I was wondering what your advice on balancing video game time and college study time. Is there a good formula?
8246000	8251000	Um, I will say yes, there is.
8251000	8256000	Um, when it's at the start of the semester, you can probably get away with gaming a bit more.
8256000	8262000	You just want to, the way that I do it when I have, because keep in mind, I was a, you know, a graphic design major.
8262000	8266000	I had a lot of projects, time intensive projects.
8266000	8275000	And for me, um, I would at least make sure I had one day a week that was my completely not school related time.
8275000	8281000	So that I could, um, just focus on other things, have fun, let my brain relax.
8281000	8285000	Because everyone needs that. If you keep studying all the time, you're going to burn yourself out.
8285000	8287000	So that's what I say.
8287000	8289000	Have a night that's you.
8289000	8295000	Um, yeah, I, I'm not the best person to answer this question because I kind of didn't finish college.
8295000	8299000	And, you know, maybe it's because I didn't prioritize the right way.
8299000	8304000	But I'll tell you kind of some things I've learned in my adult life is that certainly there's, that you can make time for video games.
8304000	8308000	I think a lot of people go, oh, you'll never be more stressed out than you are in college.
8308000	8313000	You'll never, I kind of don't think that's the case. I think your adult life stays just as busy as you are in college.
8313000	8320000	It's just that you are so overwhelmed and it's so, you know, new, that whole experience that, you know, for me, I wasn't able to do it.
8320000	8322000	But not everybody is.
8322000	8326000	So if you want the best chance for success, I'm going to tell you what I do in my adult life.
8326000	8331000	And the best example is probably like the, the actually comes back to this show, OLR.
8331000	8336000	There is a period of time when I wasn't really posting OLR to the podcast feed for like four days, five days.
8336000	8342000	I just kind of, I kind of did it whenever I fucking felt like it, you know, type of thing, which to be fair, it's a free show.
8342000	8344000	And I have the right to do that.
8344000	8350000	But at the same time, if I want to have the loyalty from the listeners, then I've got to be loyal to them.
8350000	8355000	If they're, if I expect that, you know, they're going to stay loyal to OLR, then I've got to be loyal and making sure the show gets up on time.
8355000	8364000	So I had to make a promise to myself, no video games, no MMOs, no nothing until the show gets uploaded right away on Sunday nights.
8364000	8370000	Now, granted, if there's another priority, like, oh, you have to go get your partner from work or he'll be standing out in the cold all night.
8370000	8372000	Then yes, I'll do that first and then upload the show.
8372000	8382000	But I think that's what you have to do, Ronnie, to really have that key for success is you really have to promise yourself, I'm not going to touch the games until I finish the work.
8382000	8387000	And either you're going to be able to do that or you're not.
8387000	8391000	You know, you could also have what my issue was.
8391000	8393000	I have a very strong visual memory.
8393000	8396000	I couldn't study. I don't study.
8396000	8401000	If I don't pick it up the first time I read the information, I won't pick it up at all.
8401000	8404000	Or not even read it, but from my presentation in class.
8404000	8408000	I have to tie something that I am hearing with something I'm seeing.
8408000	8411000	But once I do that, I don't have a problem.
8411000	8414000	I want to make one clarification because I'm reading the comments in chat, Ron.
8414000	8420000	It made me realize that I left this big logic gap that people might infer something I'm saying.
8420000	8424000	So I just want to be very clear because I see Bobby in chat going, don't remind me.
8424000	8428000	And I know a lot of other podcast producers do wait two or three days to put their content up.
8428000	8434000	So I'm not saying that if you don't do it in a certain amount of time, you're not loyal to your listeners.
8434000	8436000	That's not what I'm trying to say. I want to make that very clear.
8436000	8439000	You have to find what works for you.
8439000	8447000	And what I'm trying to say is that if I don't do it right away, I will slack off until the time.
8447000	8449000	It's all about self-motivation.
8449000	8450000	Exactly.
8450000	8451000	You have to do it the way you know you can do it.
8451000	8452000	Exactly.
8452000	8454000	For me, it works best that I do it right away.
8454000	8456000	Like for me, I work better under a deadline.
8456000	8464000	So I admit I'm kind of a last minute sort of person, but then I get like this really random burst of productivity.
8464000	8469000	And I freaking take advantage of it when I have one of those bursts of productivity and I get everything done.
8469000	8472000	And then I'm like, oh, crap, I don't have my deadlines anymore.
8472000	8476000	So I sort of lose track of my other stuff until once again, I'm under a deadline.
8476000	8478000	So your own motivation.
8478000	8481000	Let me get some comments in chat because chat is lighting up on this topic as well.
8481000	8486000	Speaking of Bobby, Bobby said, I actually play more video games in college than I do now.
8486000	8489000	I had more free time because I didn't have as many responsibilities.
8489000	8491000	I had classes and a part time job and that's it.
8491000	8493000	I didn't have to worry about bills and stuff.
8493000	8498000	So some say, you know, that's a very good perspective that it might get a little worse as you get older.
8498000	8501000	But being an adult is cool.
8501000	8503000	I was in band in college.
8503000	8504000	Yeah.
8504000	8507000	So I did band, I did orchestra and I did jazz band.
8507000	8511000	So most of my time was taken up by music because I had those obligations.
8511000	8515000	SSJ 100 Matt says, I had roommates who were game designers.
8515000	8518000	They failed out because they played too many video games, ironically.
8518000	8527000	And the other thing is that I actually, I think that I got more responsible with my education once I was a little older
8527000	8531000	and then started working full time and going to school almost full time.
8531000	8538000	Because, I mean, you remember how busy I was at the mortgage job and going to school and doing OLR on top of that.
8538000	8543000	So it's going to be fun trying to go back to school in the summer.
8543000	8549000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, man, we got ripped a couple of weeks ago for not posting on time.
8549000	8551000	You know, and it's going to happen.
8551000	8556000	And I think the audience is going to forgive that mistakes are going to be made or heaven forbid you take a week off.
8556000	8558000	Like we're taking a week off next week.
8558000	8560000	And I think most of our listeners are pretty understanding about that,
8560000	8564000	especially because we're trying to put out like a mini show or something to kind of bridge the gap a little bit.
8564000	8567000	So, you know, I think the audience can kind of forgive a certain way.
8567000	8573000	But if you don't have some type of like regularity, that's when you leave your audience open to go find something else to fill the void.
8573000	8575000	That's the only danger.
8575000	8579000	But, you know, one or two weeks, you're not really risking going to lose a whole lot.
8579000	8586000	But if you consistently are all over the place, consistently inconsistent, you're not going to get that consistency out of your listeners either.
8586000	8589000	That's just something I've learned over doing this for a long time.
8589000	8592000	I remember what else it was I was doing when I went to the University of South Alabama.
8592000	8597000	I drank a lot and then I moved out here and everything got better.
8597000	8599000	So there's a little bit more to this email. OK.
8599000	8604000	I realize college is all about self-independence and actually learning on your own.
8604000	8610000	But the few games they do enjoy are addictive and require a lot of time and effort, such as Civilization five, banished fallouts and Minecraft.
8610000	8613000	Plus, I want to keep up with the culture, especially as I listen to your show.
8613000	8618000	Should I give up on gaming cold turkey until I'm done with my semester or vacation?
8618000	8624000	Or did you manage to perfect a good balance with study time that I can adopt?
8624000	8627000	I have seen some people go as far as snapping their game discs.
8627000	8630000	However, I think this is stupid and my games are all on Steam anyway. Thanks.
8630000	8632000	And I guess we answered that question.
8632000	8634000	Yeah, I guess we kind of ended up answering it. You have to do what works for you.
8634000	8637000	I think the snapping the game disc, that's a little much.
8637000	8640000	That's a little extreme and tabloid.
8640000	8647000	I don't think you should have to go that far. But I mean, maybe, maybe you put your I mean, again, you said it's all on Steam, so it's not going to batter.
8647000	8659000	But maybe you take the person you trust most in the world, your best friend, your significant other, your your mother, father, take the person you trust most in the world.
8659000	8666000	Give them your Steam password and say, change it and then give it back to me when X, Y, Z is done.
8666000	8670000	You know, it might come to that point where essentially you have to give the keys to somebody else, right?
8670000	8674000	Yeah, but I think you should have a little bit more faith in yourself.
8674000	8676000	And I agree that you have to gauge yourself.
8676000	8681000	You know, like, you know, every I'll admit there are some times I skipped class to go watch Sailor Moon.
8681000	8687000	I'll admit or my thing at the time was actually running warriors because that was freaking cool.
8687000	8693000	But, you know, would stay up until two in the morning playing to Shinden because I had class at 10 the next day.
8693000	8699000	Right. You know, but that's part of the experience is, you know, if you're going to do your gaming, perhaps do something more multiplayer.
8699000	8704000	Use it as a social moment and then use it when you're done with your regular studies.
8704000	8706000	You know, and even with your study, allot yourself time.
8706000	8711000	Study in bursts of 20 minutes, take five minute break, another 20 minutes, five minute break.
8711000	8714000	But don't overload yourself with your study.
8714000	8715000	You will burn out.
8716000	8724000	It's all balance. You can't give up your fun for the sake of your responsibility.
8724000	8728000	But at the same time, you can't let your responsibility eat you.
8728000	8734000	So say bye. And yes, I played a lot of to Shinden when I was just in college, because that was 1994.
8734000	8740000	My roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation. No, 1995, got a PlayStation.
8740000	8745000	My good friend had a Japanese Sega Saturn, so I would spend a lot of time over his dorm playing that, too.
8745000	8749000	So, yeah, I did a lot of gaming in college the first time.
8749000	8751000	That's it.
8751000	8756000	All right. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have an email to send us for a future week.
8756000	8759000	In the meantime, now I can play the angry music.
8759000	8761000	Now I can get to that because it's time for the FUs of the week.
8771000	8774000	Here is punishment.
8774000	8777000	This is fucked up.
8777000	8784000	A few goes to my bizarre allergies, because I've been kind of straying a little bit from my healthy eating style.
8784000	8792000	And I found really tasty, low carb, whole wheat tortillas and my allergies starting to act up again.
8792000	8795000	So it's clearly something going on with wheat.
8795000	8800000	And I've had weird, you know, I had that really bizarre rash the other week.
8800000	8808000	So I have to cut back out all the wheat again and getting back on the straight and narrow until I go to Disneyland for my birthday.
8808000	8813000	So, yeah, fuck wheat.
8813000	8814000	Loki.
8814000	8820000	After the people that go into the self-checkout line and don't know how to use the self-checkout line,
8820000	8827000	I waited in line for about like 5-10 minutes for someone checking out one thing.
8827000	8835000	It's like I was out of there in 30 seconds, but I don't know why these people stand there kind of staring at the screen not knowing what to do.
8838000	8843000	I'm just going to give an FU to the stress of moving.
8843000	8851000	And the fact, I'm going to, I'll say this, I'm going to give an FU to the fact that I know that people dig through the garbage here at my apartment complex as they do at most apartment complexes.
8851000	8857000	And part of why I'm excited to move into a house is that, yay, I can put the garbage out right when they come to pick it up and all that stuff.
8857000	8858000	So that's exciting.
8858000	8863000	But the thing that like really pisses me off is that, like, I've got all this mail and the shredders kind of dead.
8863000	8867000	So it's like, and I don't want to throw it away because people go through the garbage.
8867000	8871000	So it's like, I've got my shredder works. Does it? I've got a lot.
8871000	8873000	But it's okay. You can bring it over and use my shredder.
8873000	8881000	We've been talking about, uh, just maybe taking a big bulk thing over to like Staples or one of those stores that, you know, office stores that does the shredding, but it's just irritating.
8881000	8886000	I can also talk to Dan and see if you can use a secure shred at, that's an option.
8886000	8890000	You never know. You never know. Anyway, so, all right.
8890000	8893000	Um, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys.
8893000	8899000	And we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8899000	8902000	But first, let's get to Loki.
8902000	8909000	Yes, so everybody's favorite space simulation game is now teaming up with NASA.
8909000	8917000	Kerbel Space Program is teaming up with NASA to actually do, what is it, an asteroid redirect mission.
8917000	8922000	And it's supposed to be based off of real NASA data.
8922000	8929000	And that they're, I don't know, I guess maybe allowing people to kind of try to come up with their own ideas.
8929000	8937000	Basically, Kerbel Space Program is giving the gamers a chance to dream big even if they're not astrophysicists.
8937000	8947000	The relationship with NASA, the very beacon of big dreams and imagination is going to give players a real opportunity to learn about the universe we're living in.
8947000	8956000	And I guess, you know, what this mission entails is attempting to land astronauts on an asteroid orbiting between our moon.
8956000	8966000	So, I'm guessing, or beyond our moon, so I'm guessing that, are we looking at like a Armageddon type situation here?
8966000	8974000	Are we going to land on the asteroid and blow it up or something like that? I mean, is that what we're doing here?
8974000	8977000	Either way, it looks like it'll be fun.
8977000	8982000	That sounds awesome. I like it when real life kind of meets video games like that.
8982000	8986000	Have you played this Kerbel Space Program at all? Because I know I really haven't.
8986000	8988000	I haven't. I kind of wanted, though.
8988000	8989000	Yeah?
8989000	8993000	I mean, it looks good. I'll wait for it until it goes on sale.
8993000	8999000	Awesome. I think it was in a Humble Bundle recently, though. I don't know if it's going to get much cheaper than that.
9000000	9004000	No, it wasn't. You're thinking Starbound.
9004000	9008000	Yeah, if it was in Humble Bundle, I would have remembered that.
9008000	9011000	Maybe it was in one of the other indie bundles, because I swear I got that game through one of those.
9011000	9015000	But anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
9015000	9022000	And this is actually pretty sad, and I don't like to end shows on sad notes, but it is what it is.
9022000	9027000	I've got a report that Jeff Edwards passed away this past week at the age of 83.
9027000	9031000	He died on March 5th, 2014, in Santa Monica, California.
9031000	9037000	Probably best known for hosting game shows. He hosted Jackpot and Treasure Hunt.
9037000	9041000	And, of course, why would I bring him up on a video game podcast, Dark Sakura?
9041000	9045000	What else did he host that we all know? If you grew up in the 80s.
9045000	9047000	What? No.
9047000	9048000	Oh, I thought you knew.
9048000	9049000	No, I didn't.
9049000	9051000	Loki, do you know?
9051000	9053000	Nope.
9053000	9056000	I know his name, so I'm trying to run through my head.
9056000	9057000	Starrcade.
9057000	9059000	Starrcade, oh my god, yeah.
9059000	9065000	The granddaddy of playing the video game shows there in the early 80s.
9065000	9067000	Sorry to put you on the spot, Jamie. I thought you knew. I thought that's why you went off.
9067000	9068000	Thanks, Rob.
9068000	9069000	Sorry.
9069000	9075000	But, yeah, obviously a very well-known game show host just from that and so forth.
9075000	9078000	So, yeah, really sad to hear that.
9078000	9084000	I mean, he was 83, but still, you know, these are never any fun to report on.
9084000	9088000	So, tip one back for the man that gave away arcade machines.
9088000	9091000	Actually, I saw an episode on YouTube. They are all on YouTube.
9091000	9094000	There's, like, people that have archived, like, every single episode on YouTube.
9094000	9095000	Nice.
9095000	9097000	They gave away a fucking Tron machine in a couple episodes.
9097000	9098000	What?
9098000	9102000	Little jerk kids that won the Tron machine.
9102000	9105000	Yeah, I bet they don't even have it anymore. Jerks.
9106000	9110000	All right. We are going to go to the Skype line right now.
9110000	9113000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.
9113000	9116000	Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
9116000	9119000	Dartetsuya says, I was surprised that he was that old when he started.
9119000	9122000	Yeah, he kind of – because if you think about it, you know, that show was back in the 80s.
9122000	9124000	That was, what, like 30 years ago.
9124000	9126000	He was in his 50s when that show was on.
9126000	9131000	So, hey, there's still hope for me to host a game show someday, right?
9131000	9133000	We need to get you a sparkly jacket.
9133000	9135000	I have a sparkly jacket.
9135000	9137000	Well, of course you do, Rocky.
9137000	9139000	When were you Columbia?
9139000	9144000	Birdcage Cinemas, late 90s, early 2000s.
9144000	9146000	You seriously were Columbia?
9146000	9149000	I did Columbia one time, but I wore somebody else's.
9149000	9152000	I wore Jessica's jacket or somebody else's back in the – from those days.
9152000	9154000	I'm just trying to picture you as Columbia.
9154000	9157000	Well, I was walking down the street just to have an opinion.
9157000	9160000	Okay. I guess if I could do Dr. Scott, you can do Columbia.
9160000	9162000	Do you want me to tap dance right now for you?
9162000	9163000	No.
9163000	9165000	Quick, somebody call. Are you going to get tap danced?
9165000	9166000	You can make the squeal noise.
9166000	9167000	Mm-hmm.
9167000	9168000	Eddie!
9168000	9169000	Eddie!
9169000	9173000	Sadly, there's people listening to this show that have never seen the Rocky Horror Pictures show.
9173000	9175000	That's your homework assignment, everybody.
9175000	9176000	Poor children.
9176000	9179000	Watch it and make sure you have friends with you who have seen it
9179000	9183000	so that you at least won't get caught out as a virgin at the real show.
9183000	9186000	All right. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call
9186000	9188000	because we do have a caller on the line.
9188000	9190000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?
9190000	9191000	This is Raging Aider.
9191000	9193000	Hey, Raging Aider. Nice to see you. What's up?
9193000	9195000	Nice to see you, too.
9195000	9199000	How long since you had Justin TV?
9199000	9202000	Justin TV. When were those days?
9202000	9204000	That was like the mid-300s with those episodes.
9204000	9205000	Those were the other house.
9205000	9208000	That was two studios ago.
9208000	9209000	Yes.
9209000	9210000	It was a while ago.
9210000	9212000	Yeah, it's been a while.
9212000	9220000	But anyway, a couple really quick random questions.
9220000	9224000	You know, DarkSakura already knows that I mentioned this to her
9224000	9228000	on Steam's chat, I think, yesterday.
9228000	9236000	I just signed up for Origin yesterday.
9236000	9242000	Now, probably one of the first games I'm probably going to plan on buying on there
9242000	9246000	would be Mass Effect 3.
9246000	9247000	Do it.
9247000	9248000	A worthy choice.
9248000	9253000	Now, I know you guys are big fans of the series.
9253000	9257000	No, us? Loki hates it, for what it's worth.
9257000	9260000	Get all the games if you don't have them.
9260000	9263000	You can't just start on three.
9263000	9268000	I'm just starting to really get into the series myself,
9268000	9272000	and I just barely started playing the first game,
9272000	9277000	and actually I haven't played the third one yet, but that's precisely the point.
9277000	9282000	Now, the question is, how is the multiplayer on Mass Effect 3?
9282000	9283000	Is it any good?
9283000	9285000	What's the best part of the game?
9285000	9287000	It's really good, Rage Nator,
9287000	9291000	and the reason why is because they focused on co-op instead of competitive.
9291000	9294000	In fact, there is no competitive multiplayer in Mass Effect 3,
9294000	9297000	which I can see where some people might see that as a bummer, which is fine.
9297000	9300000	Maybe that'll be in the next Mass Effect game, but it is all co-op,
9300000	9304000	and essentially what it is is that it's four of you defending a base.
9304000	9307000	You defend a base against ten waves of aliens.
9307000	9309000	And different missions for each wave, too.
9309000	9313000	Yes, waves three, six, and ten have special missions,
9313000	9317000	and that might be like, hold this point, or escort this drone.
9317000	9320000	Or carry this item, so you can't run while you're carrying it.
9320000	9325000	So you have to cooperate, and that's why I think the multiplayer attracts people
9325000	9329000	like myself and Dark Soccer, who don't usually play shooter-type multiplayer,
9329000	9333000	is because it fosters an environment of helping people.
9333000	9336000	And the people that are going to be like, man, you suck, and duh-duh-duh-duh-duh,
9336000	9339000	they don't usually play on beginner anyway.
9339000	9342000	They don't play on the bronze matches. They're all in gold and platinum.
9342000	9344000	The bronze matches are more fun anyway.
9344000	9347000	You just sort of fuck around from time to time.
9347000	9350000	And if somebody's being that big of an asshat, then you leave and they're fucked.
9350000	9353000	We've done silver matches anyway, and it was pretty fun.
9353000	9355000	Remember that one time we tried a platinum match,
9355000	9357000	and we almost made it through one wave?
9357000	9359000	Yeah, I know. Platinum matches are pretty scary.
9359000	9361000	But yeah, there's a lot to that.
9361000	9363000	Here's my only concern, Reginator. Here's my concern.
9363000	9367000	I'm going to be real with you because you're getting into Mass Effect 3 a little late in the game.
9367000	9372000	I worry because EA has this tendency when they got a new game coming out,
9372000	9375000	they're going to yank the servers on the old game.
9375000	9382000	I think you've got at least a good year left because this is all the Mass Effect we have right now.
9382000	9386000	Until they announce Mass Effect Next, I can't call it Mass Effect 4
9386000	9387000	because they say it's going to be something else,
9387000	9390000	but until we know what Mass Effect Next really is,
9390000	9395000	then I can't really sit here one way or the other and say, you know,
9395000	9398000	when these multiplayer servers are going to go down.
9398000	9399000	So I think you've got a good year left.
9399000	9404000	How about, though, we set a night that we run you through the ropes of multiplayer some night?
9404000	9409000	You're very kind. For me, it's going to have to be a couple weeks because I'm moving,
9409000	9411000	so I can't volunteer for that.
9411000	9416000	I gave you my origin. I don't care who knows it. It's Kuro Tsubasa, like my Tumblr.
9416000	9418000	But I bet you will find some other VoG people that will help you out.
9418000	9421000	Maybe you guys can convince Bobby Black Wolf to finally use his copy.
9421000	9424000	Yeah, Bobby. Play with us.
9424000	9430000	Actually, I did send out four or five invites already.
9430000	9434000	One person already accepted. I was just waiting for the rest of the people to log in.
9434000	9440000	I haven't signed into Origin in like five months, so if I'm one of them, I'll get around to it eventually.
9440000	9442000	I didn't sign into Origin for a little while,
9442000	9447000	and I'm actually, while I'm trying to finish my 17th...
9447000	9450000	Actually, no, I'm on my 18th playthrough of Mass Effect 3 right now.
9450000	9457000	And when I finish that one, then I'm going to be going to Dragon Age 2 to give it another good run-through again.
9457000	9465000	Yeah, I kind of think of it. I saw Dragon Age listed on their online store,
9466000	9471000	and I don't know a whole lot about that series.
9471000	9476000	Above and beyond, maybe one or two trailers that I may have seen on PlayStation Network.
9476000	9483000	But would you say that Dragon Age is a good series to play if you like role-playing games?
9483000	9489000	I love Dragon Age 2. It's a lot more combat-oriented, but there's plenty of good role-play elements in it.
9489000	9496000	I couldn't get into it the way that Alan really got into it, and Shane, one of my best friends, is really into it.
9496000	9499000	I couldn't get into it the way they did.
9499000	9504000	Maybe, you know what though, but again, Mass Effect was a game I tried,
9504000	9507000	and I just didn't get back to it until years later, and I was like,
9507000	9511000	this is the best thing ever. So I think I just need to go back and try Dragon Age again.
9511000	9514000	I kept starting the first Dragon Age and kept stopping it,
9514000	9518000	and then I just picked up Dragon Age 2 and just played and played the crap out of it,
9518000	9521000	and then got to this one part that I couldn't beat,
9521000	9524000	because I was a stupid idiot and brought Fenris into this one dream level.
9524000	9528000	Fenris, by the way, is awesome, and you want to have them on your good side.
9528000	9532000	But then I went back and played through on PC.
9532000	9536000	I started having these problems with my hand, and I've beaten the game on PC,
9536000	9540000	and I'm actually going to be kind of skipping the first Dragon Age again and going back to Dragon Age 2.
9540000	9545000	Ragenator, I feel like in some ways we've seen you groan as a gamer as you've been listening to OLR.
9545000	9548000	I know you've been listening for a while now, but I remember when you first would call this show,
9548000	9552000	you'd be talking about Nintendo 64 games and stuff that was really classics,
9552000	9557000	and now you're getting up to games from like last year, so I'm impressed, Ragenator.
9557000	9563000	Yeah, honestly, you know, as weird as this sounds,
9563000	9572000	my PlayStation 3 being stolen a year and a half ago is actually a good thing in a sense.
9572000	9579000	Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but before my PlayStation 3 was stolen,
9579000	9584000	I would never in a million years consider PC gaming.
9584000	9592000	Now that it's gone, I kind of like begrudgingly signed up for Steam.
9592000	9595000	And now it's a whole new world! There you go.
9595000	9597000	All right, well, Ragenator, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,
9597000	9602000	but have fun on Origin, and I will try to jump in the game and kill some of the Reapers.
9602000	9604000	You'll learn why we call it LoLirgin.
9604000	9606000	All right. Bye, buddy. Take care.
9606000	9608000	Yep, you too. Take care.
9608000	9612000	All right, that was Ragenator on our Skype line at 1877 Game OLR,
9612000	9615000	or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
9615000	9617000	and BobbyBlackWolf in chat saying,
9617000	9620000	I haven't opened Origin in a year. It was SimCity.
9620000	9624000	And apparently BobbyBlackWolf and Shane having a discussion about
9624000	9627000	that they can't like the same things, apparently,
9627000	9628000	which is why Bobby doesn't like Mass Effect.
9628000	9630000	They're playing Final Fantasy XIV.
9630000	9631000	Yeah, very good point.
9631000	9632000	Oh, actually, what Shane just said.
9632000	9634000	Yeah, Shane just said that in the chat.
9634000	9639000	But, to be fair, Shane, Bobby always makes fun of Endgame,
9639000	9641000	which is all you sign in to do.
9641000	9644000	I need to fucking catch up.
9644000	9646000	I just hit level 34.
9646000	9648000	I feel like I'm being so slow.
9648000	9649000	Oh, that's all right.
9649000	9651000	I took my time with WoW, too.
9651000	9653000	You know what, though? The converse of that?
9653000	9656000	Oh, by the way, again, the Skype line is open at 1877 Game OLR,
9656000	9657000	username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9657000	9659000	The converse of that, DarkSakura,
9659000	9661000	is that when you burn through the content too fast, like where I'm at,
9661000	9664000	I only sign in to raid, and then outside of that, I'm like,
9664000	9665000	what else am I going to do?
9665000	9666000	Should I level another class?
9666000	9667000	Eh, I'm over it.
9667000	9668000	I'm going to go play Diablo.
9668000	9669000	Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
9669000	9672000	Yeah, I mean, but I also started another character
9672000	9674000	so I could play with Junami.
9674000	9675000	Oh, nice.
9675000	9676000	On the work server.
9676000	9680000	Shane's been really trying to get me to go back to Final Fantasy XI,
9680000	9683000	which apparently they've made all these quality of life changes.
9683000	9685000	You can just zip through a lot of the content
9685000	9688000	you used to have to find parties for and all this stuff, so.
9688000	9691000	Well, the only change they need to make is make it go free to play.
9691000	9693000	Right? That's the one change they need to make,
9693000	9695000	and I'll be on Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.
9695000	9696000	You hear that, Shane?
9696000	9698000	Make it free to play, and you got it.
9698000	9699000	I'm back.
9699000	9700000	But I don't know, it's Square Enix.
9700000	9703000	Do you see Square Enix doing a free-to-play MMO like that?
9703000	9706000	I mean, I guess they have free-to-play mobile games.
9706000	9707000	Some of them are free.
9707000	9708000	They'll monetize the crap out of it, though.
9708000	9711000	They'll have you buying Gil and all sorts of garbage like that.
9711000	9714000	Yeah, some of them are pretty awful.
9714000	9717000	Well, you know, and I talk about this with World of Warcraft,
9717000	9720000	is that I always say that Blizzard should just give the vanilla game away
9720000	9726000	and then sell the expansions, and as far as Final Fantasy XI goes,
9726000	9728000	I think they could do that there as well,
9728000	9731000	is that they could give away the vanilla game
9731000	9735000	and then just sell the expansions or something like that.
9735000	9736000	Let's see.
9736000	9739000	I have a problem that if I get to Endgame in XIV,
9739000	9742000	I'm going to get bored again and then go back to Space Goats
9742000	9745000	when it comes out for a while.
9745000	9751000	Dan's like, no, but I don't know.
9751000	9753000	Unfortunately, the listeners are not able to hear my voice right now
9753000	9755000	because our server went down.
9755000	9756000	It's not us.
9756000	9757000	Unfortunately.
9757000	9758000	Yeah.
9758000	9759000	No.
9759000	9762000	So I can put a call out for calls, but we're not going to get any.
9762000	9767000	So I guess I can go to Twitter at this point.
9767000	9768000	Hopefully we'll get through at some point.
9768000	9770000	God, that pisses me off.
9770000	9773000	I get pissed off too.
9773000	9775000	I've about had it with this hosting server.
9775000	9776000	So have I.
9776000	9778000	We need to tell them to best TFU.
9778000	9779000	It's getting a little ridiculous,
9779000	9783000	and I think we've given them the stern email before
9783000	9786000	that they are not to do reboots on our server on Sunday night,
9786000	9788000	and yet here we are.
9788000	9792000	So something's going to happen with that.
9792000	9794000	They're going to lose some business.
9794000	9798000	Meanwhile, I'm going to our Twitter,
9798000	9801000	and SG100Matt tweeted us a story about Jeff Edwards,
9801000	9804000	so a lot of people thinking about Jeff Edwards.
9804000	9807000	Our friend Marin Marvel, Tiara, tweeted and said,
9807000	9810000	OLR is going up against Neil T. Sun.
9810000	9811000	What is that?
9811000	9813000	And Cosmos right now.
9813000	9817000	Oh, because Cosmos is back with...
9817000	9818000	Neil Tyson.
9818000	9819000	Yeah.
9819000	9820000	And says, sorry, guys.
9820000	9821000	Got to get my science nerd on.
9821000	9823000	This is why we podcast the show.
9823000	9824000	I can forgive.
9824000	9825000	We're back, by the way.
9825000	9826000	I can forgive.
9826000	9827000	Oh, good.
9827000	9828000	We're back.
9828000	9830000	You guys missed my little rant where I've basically said,
9830000	9833000	as far as this server host of ours goes,
9833000	9836000	I have had it officially.
9836000	9837000	Yeah, we've reconnected.
9837000	9838000	We're streaming.
9838000	9839000	We're good.
9839000	9840000	We're good.
9840000	9841000	Although, honestly, I'm going to go back
9841000	9844000	and download the torrent of Cosmos so I can watch it,
9844000	9849000	because, man, I grew up with Carl Sagan and Cosmos, you know?
9849000	9851000	And what was that show that had that old guy
9851000	9854000	that would walk on, like, a path of stars
9854000	9856000	or something in outer space?
9856000	9857000	Do you remember that show, Rob?
9857000	9858000	I don't.
9858000	9859000	It was like this astronomy show.
9859000	9860000	Mm-mm.
9860000	9861000	The fuck show was that?
9861000	9863000	Oh, my God, because I used to watch that show.
9863000	9865000	I'm like, oh, my God, he's in space.
9865000	9867000	And then I got older, but I kept watching it.
9867000	9868000	It was a really good show.
9868000	9870000	God, help me, chat room.
9870000	9873000	I don't remember what this show was, and I'm old.
9873000	9874000	In response to last week's show,
9874000	9879000	Picuruno said, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a great game, no joke,
9879000	9882000	and I did get both zombie DLC packs for Train Simulator.
9882000	9884000	They actually have a story.
9886000	9889000	Act deft on a couple things from last week.
9889000	9891000	My Little Pony, Fighting is Magic tribute edition
9891000	9893000	is released by fans.
9893000	9896000	Note, this is not done by main six, the original devs.
9896000	9898000	Oh, maybe that was a story for last week's show,
9898000	9900000	or maybe that was submitted for this week.
9900000	9901000	I don't know anymore.
9901000	9902000	It says six days.
9903000	9906000	So, put out one more call for calls.
9906000	9911000	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9912000	9915000	But I wouldn't be surprised at all if our little upsy and downsies
9915000	9916000	with the server.
9916000	9918000	I want someone to remind me what the fuck that show was,
9918000	9919000	because it's really pissing me off now.
9919000	9920000	Describe it one more time.
9920000	9923000	It had, like, some old guy, not old, but, you know,
9923000	9929000	silver-haired guy, kind of, not portly, but kind of...
9929000	9930000	Fluffy.
9930000	9931000	Fluffy.
9931000	9936000	And, oh my God, no, it wasn't Harry Caray, Space the Infinite Frontier.
9936000	9940000	And he would wear, like, these sweaters with his collar poking out
9940000	9942000	and would just, like, talk about space.
9942000	9944000	It was an astronomy show.
9944000	9945000	No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard?
9945000	9946000	No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard.
9946000	9947000	Mr. Wizard wasn't Fluffy either.
9947000	9948000	It wasn't Mr. Wizard.
9948000	9950000	You know Mr. Wizard hated kids.
9950000	9951000	Yes, I heard that.
9951000	9954000	That's got to be an underground legend thing, though.
9954000	9958000	But he'd, like, walk up into space and everything
9958000	9960000	on, like, his trail of stars.
9960000	9962000	Now I don't freaking remember what it was called.
9962000	9964000	That was an awesome show.
9964000	9966000	All right.
9966000	9967000	I'll put one more call out.
9967000	9970000	1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9970000	9972000	Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight?
9972000	9973000	I haven't called on you yet.
9973000	9974000	I do, actually.
9974000	9977000	There's going to be an update to Just Cause 2 multiplayer,
9977000	9978000	and you remember that mod?
9978000	9982000	It allows you to play, like, thousands of people online at one time.
9982000	9984000	Well, they've added a few things.
9984000	9987000	Earthquakes, real-time vehicle color changing.
9987000	9989000	You can teleport.
9989000	9990000	Gibs on death.
9990000	9994000	You can also do a Back to the Future-style car teleportation.
9994000	9999000	Hats, heat-seeking missiles, and cars that drive in the water.
9999000	10002000	Plus, you can also blend objects together,
10002000	10007000	so they have a picture of an airplane combined with a whale.
10007000	10009000	Good stuff.
10009000	10010000	All right.
10010000	10012000	I had a call, and then they hung up, so,
10012000	10015000	because I had them on hold while Loki was finishing that thought.
10015000	10017000	Darsakha, you found your show?
10017000	10024000	Yes, it was Stargazers, with Jack Fulley, Horkmimer.
10024000	10026000	I'm double-checking that this is him,
10026000	10028000	but the show used to be called Star Hustler.
10028000	10032000	So, that was our buddy, VX JasonXV, who Google-food that for you.
10032000	10035000	I found it, but then I went back and saw that he did it.
10035000	10036000	Okay.
10036000	10038000	Star Hustler sounds like an awesome sci-fi series.
10038000	10039000	It does.
10039000	10040000	And there's not a picture of him.
10040000	10042000	Crap.
10042000	10044000	But it was a cool show.
10044000	10047000	He died in, oh, he died in Florida in 2010.
10047000	10049000	Oh, sad.
10049000	10051000	What a sad ending to that story.
10051000	10052000	Any other last-minute stories, Loki,
10052000	10057000	while we wait to see if somebody calls back, or?
10057000	10058000	That was it.
10058000	10059000	That was it.
10059000	10061000	It was him, and that was the show.
10061000	10062000	Oh, my God.
10062000	10064000	No, I didn't have anything else.
10064000	10065000	All right.
10065000	10067000	Well, it is after 9 o'clock, so I guess I'm going to go ahead
10067000	10071000	and shut down the Skype line and wrap things up for the night.
10071000	10072000	Sorry to those that didn't get through,
10072000	10074000	but if you want to email us, participate.
10074000	10077000	At orangelandtrader.com is the place to send those emails.
10077000	10080000	Once again, we will not be back next week.
10080000	10084000	We'll have something taped, so podcast listeners,
10084000	10086000	nothing will actually change for you except a plan
10086000	10088000	that the show will be a little shorter next week.
10088000	10093000	Live folks, you will hear that show debut Sunday night here
10093000	10095000	on the network, and then Starboard Power Coupling
10095000	10098000	in their preview spot right after us next Sunday,
10098000	10101000	and then we'll be back live in two weeks.
10101000	10103000	Everybody, please cross your fingers and toes for me.
10103000	10105000	I need all the happy thoughts I can.
10105000	10108000	Not only did the move goes well, but the internet works very well
10108000	10110000	in the new place, and we're able to get everything set up.
10110000	10112000	Because if not, fuck you, Comcast.
10112000	10115000	Yeah, because if not, I don't know what's going to happen.
10115000	10118000	I just want to warn people there's the possibility.
10118000	10120000	We'll be in my living room.
10120000	10122000	Yeah, there's a possibility if things go wrong,
10122000	10124000	we could be gone for more than a week.
10124000	10127000	So I just want to prepare everybody for that, but trust us.
10127000	10130000	We will do all that we can to be back ASAP.
10130000	10136000	That's just my disclaimer in my whole I love you guys.
10136000	10139000	Tune in and listen to every minute of every show.
10139000	10143000	So trust me, we will be back ASAP just in case.
10143000	10146000	Meanwhile, that is it.
10146000	10148000	It's about time to wrap up another week of the show.
10148000	10150000	You know what? You said meanwhile,
10150000	10152000	and it made me think of Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice.
10152000	10155000	And Becky and I passed the Hall of Justice.
10155000	10156000	The Hall of Justice.
10156000	10157000	The Hall of Justice.
10157000	10158000	In Susanville?
10158000	10161000	Not in Susanville, but up in one of those little small towns.
10161000	10163000	And we wanted to go back and take a picture of it.
10163000	10164000	Nice.
10164000	10166000	But we also passed a red phone booth.
10166000	10167000	That's awesome.
10167000	10169000	Like an old school red phone booth.
10169000	10170000	Nice.
10170000	10171000	That's cool.
10171000	10172000	All right.
10172000	10174000	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10174000	10177000	Thank you guys as always for tuning in every week and supporting our show.
10177000	10178000	We appreciate it.
10178000	10182000	You know, all we say, just if you like the show, help spread the word.
10182000	10184000	Leave a nice review on iTunes.
10184000	10185000	Stitcher's really great too.
10185000	10187000	We need more good reviews there.
10187000	10192000	Also, tell a friend or two or five or 50 about the show and help us spread the word.
10192000	10193000	That is all we ask.
10193000	10197000	And spread the word about all independent broadcasting and all the great hardworking.
10197000	10200000	I just gave a shout out to like five other podcast buddies of mine.
10200000	10203000	I know there's a lot of other hardworking people out there at the Voice of Geeks Network
10203000	10207000	and other networks out there and just everybody that works hard.
10207000	10211000	Also, eat your vegetables.
10211000	10213000	Because I believe in your health.
10213000	10217000	Loki, I really hope that we're able to see you in a couple weeks.
10217000	10218000	But if not, I understand.
10218000	10220000	We'll do the Skype thing a little longer.
10220000	10223000	But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10223000	10226000	More people need to play on the Minecraft server, including me.
10226000	10227000	Including me?
10227000	10230000	I've been very failing in getting on there.
10230000	10231000	I'll try to log in tomorrow.
10231000	10232000	Yeah.
10232000	10233000	All right.
10233000	10238000	My final thought for tonight is I at least hope the internet holds up better at the new place.
10238000	10241000	And Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought.
10241000	10242000	Here's my new catchphrase.
10242000	10244000	Question everything.
10244000	10245000	Hmm.
10245000	10246000	All right.
10246000	10247000	That's going to do it.
10247000	10249000	We will see you next time from our brand new studio in two weeks.
10249000	10251000	Until then, good night.
10272000	10284000	See you next week.
10302000	10314000	Bye.
