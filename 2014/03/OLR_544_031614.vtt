Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, on the heels of Amazon's entry into game publishing, Google recently acquired a game peripheral company likely for use on a future Android device. Also, the first rule of DriveClub is do not talk about DriveClub's release date, because there isn't one. We'll tell you about all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:50.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio for this March the, not the 13th, the day we're recording, but March the 16th of 2014 with episode number 544 of our show.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
Hello from the past, but I'll get to that in a minute. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you as always with my co-hosts. Say hello here with me in studio to Jamie Sommers for DarkSakura.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I live through the power of caffeine.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How are you doing?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Sup bitches who aren't in chat.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
You're somewhere between caffeinated and coffee-nated.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
I guess. I'd live on coffee since I work in tech support. My entire diet is coffee.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Is it instead of like, you know, the big jugs of water, you know, filtered water that most offices have, they just have jugs of coffee?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
We have coffee makers in all of our break rooms that give us free coffee.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Nice. It's important.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
With the option of a half-caf.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
So, the land of cubes in tech is equipped with coffee. It should also be the lands of cube tech in coffee, but that wouldn't make a good acronym.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
It wouldn't be quite as good of an acronym.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
We also say hello via the Skype line once again. He's with us this week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Hello.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Hey, how you doing, Loki?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Doing all right.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah. How's being a dad going?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
It's going okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Tiring.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Any new projects that you've been able to start while you've been trying to raise the kids in between?

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
I've been working in Unity. That's about it.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Were you inspired by FlappyVog?

02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
Not necessarily. Well, sort of. Basically, I looked at the amount of cell phone games that are out there and how people make kind of a quick buck.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
The way I look at it is if I put something together, even if it just does mildly okay, it's still more money than no money. So, you know, why not?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
So, you just kind of want to throw something out there and see what sticks?

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, originally I was going to do something like that.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
But then I ended up going back to... Originally when I was trying to make games and stuff, I had a bunch of concepts I was throwing around.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
And I actually had stuck with one. You're going to love this, except the fact that all the work is gone now.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
I actually was working on an F-Zero GX clone at one time, and it was on my old laptop hard drive, and I lost everything.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
No!

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But that was really cool. I may go back to that someday, but all my work's gone there.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
So I started a new project, and I've been kind of chugging along with it, and it's okay so far.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm just trying to get some of what I wanted out of the engine done, and then I kind of have a basic idea of what I want to do.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
But I'm trying not to get, you know, they call it feature creep, where you start like, hey, I want to do this and this and this and this.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
And it just gets overly complicated. But so far, because I've watched lots of videos and read things about Unity and programming and all that stuff.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
And I just don't retain any of it unless I actually do it. So I've been doing it, and I've been learning a lot.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So that's what I'm kind of doing now.

03:51.000 --> 04:00.000
That's very normal. I do the corporate training for a living, and we learn as trainers pretty early on that some people live by hearing, some people live by watching.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
A lot of people learn by doing, and the best method of teaching people involves some combination of the three.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
So by you kind of, you know, listening and hearing the YouTube and then actually getting the hands-on practice, I think, is the most important part.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
But, you know, there was that big interview that came out with Dong Nguyen this week in Rolling Stone.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Somebody finally tracked him down and found him. He did that big interview to Rolling Stone.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And it really sounded like, you know, he never intended to make the type of money.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I think we kind of knew this anyway based on his tweets, but he never intended to make the kind of money off Flappyware that he did.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
It just kind of took off and it went viral. So you never know what games are going to go viral or what games may not catch on.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
It's cool that I kind of, you know, want to do that, but, I mean, I don't think you can really expect that.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
And all I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do something somewhat unique, but I don't know.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
I've already, in my process of, you know, researching stuff, I found one other game that's very similar.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
But the style-wise is going to be completely different and the tone of it is going to be kind of different.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
So, we'll see. But right now, I mean, I actually had some problems in the engine that I was trying to solve.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
And I actually came up with a creative solution that worked. So I was like, wow, I actually learned something.

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
You know, there's a plug-in that I knew nothing about and I was just like, oh, I don't know how the heck to use this.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And, like, during lunch today, I figured out how to use it. I was like, okay, cool. So I'm actually going to be able to do this, I think.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Another little piece of the puzzle.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, good luck to you. We're going to check in on updates when we get over to our new studio, which, to kind of transition a little bit,

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
I think, unless this is your very first time listening to Orange Ons Radio, in which case, welcome.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
And I warn you tonight is a very different sort of episode. But for those of you guys that do listen to Orange Ons Radio every week,

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
you guys know that we're actually not live on Sunday night this week because I am currently in the process of moving from the apartment that I'm currently in

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
into a house where our new studio will be at. So, therefore, we had to shut down the show for this week.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
But we still wanted to, you know, those of you guys that rely on us to be there every week, we wanted to give you at least a little something,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
even though the show tonight will probably be a lot shorter than what we're used to.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And a big part of that reason is that we do not have our chat room tonight.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
But for those that are listening to the premiere on Sunday night, a big hello to all you guys in chat who stuck around after Bobby's show

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
because we do typically tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
vognetwork.com. And we will be back there next week, barring any major malfunctions in the new studio.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
Just a disclaimer there. We will be back in the next week with a brand new live show and look forward to having you guys there.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
But not a dead show.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, let's hope. Let's hope. I don't want this to be our last episode ever. Although I'm sure it will be a fine episode.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
We're gonna hit on some of the usual segments that we usually do here, just in a bit more speedy format if, for lack of a better term.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
We don't really have a kickoff topic tonight, so I'm gonna get right into our gaming weeks.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
I did play some Final Fantasy XIV, and I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing, which I just wrapped up doing, because these bitches keep inviting themselves to my house.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
This is so funny. We were just about ready to record, and I'm coming out of the restroom, heading over to the coffee machine, and DarkSakura go,

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
I hate it! I hate it when people invite themselves over to my house. And I'm like, whoa, is somebody at your house? Do you, like, have to go?

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
And she's like, I'm talking about Animal Crossing. I'm like, oh. I thought maybe, like, somebody let themselves into your house, like they wanted to play pinball or something.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And she goes to my house. Just me and the cat.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I've been to your house. That's not true.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, like, four times.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
That's a few times.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's all good. It's all good.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I watched Showgirls with you. It was girl bonding.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
That was awesome.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And then you got to try...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
No, we had the bottle of Frivolo that night, didn't we?

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
No, no, no, no. You got to try the honey wine.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
If it involved liquor? I don't remember.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I got to try the elderberry wine. That stuff was amazing.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, you, me, and Monet will have to get together and watch more scary movies again.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Heck yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Anyway, sorry to interrupt your gaming week.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Girl.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Final Fantasy XIV?

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, I played that. Played Animal Crossing. That's about it, because I've been working, working it.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
But I am very sad, because I cannot do my birthday at Disneyland this year.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Because it's fucking Easter.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Oh, so it's going to be packed.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
You always run into that danger around your birthday, though.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
I do. And it's also the last weekend of Passover, so I have to observe and not have K go on my birthday again.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
We all have these odd events that happen around our birthday. Like, you have Easter.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Sometimes there are mass murders on my birthday.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
You know what's always around my birthday is the Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh, that's right.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So that's where all my friends want to go. They're like, they don't care about my birthday.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Speaking of games and gay, I have my ticket to GamerX.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I heard!

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Thanks to a lovely listener, which I don't know if he wants me to say it was him, but happy birthday.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
You know who you are. Wink, wink.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Happy birthday to me. Thank you very much for the ticket. I greatly appreciate it.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
That was really cool. Jamie told me who you are, obviously, and I'm like, that was so cool of him.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah. So that means I get to go. So I'm not as depressed about Disneyland anymore.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
So I'm actually probably going to be even canceling my time off request for work, so that I can take the time off for GamerX.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Hopefully it'll work out where we're going to have a panel again this year and this time you can be on the panel.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Cool.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
And so some of our listeners can come meet you.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
But now I have to cosplay and I have no time to make a fucking costume.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
So anyone listening to this show, if you want to help me make a costume or, you know, I will buy fucking material and whatever.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
I know some people here locally through the theater stuff I've done that can help you out, especially one girl I'm thinking of actually specializes in cosplay.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
She would cost though. So it just kind of depends if you're willing to spend the money.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, the ideas that I have is just doing a, you know, a femme shop costume, just the pants and my hoodie, just because it'd be easy and quick.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, if you cosplay, I'm going to have to cosplay.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Hell yeah. My other one is wanting to do something Homestuck.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
At least I could use mine at Dragon Con also, so it wouldn't be a complete waste.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
I want to do a Silph of Heart costume for Homestuck, which actually looks really easy. It's just I don't sew for shit.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
I have butchered and put together all of my last costumes from thrift store finds, which granted my Jill Valentine costume was really good.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
Thrift stores where it's at, you don't know how many Rocky horrors and clues and repos, genetic operas and all that.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Do you remember my Shorty cosplay?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh god.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And my Emmy cosplay.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
That was when I first met you.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
That was. I wore it to AX 2000.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
For those that don't know who Shorty or Emmy are?

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Shorty from, I did the Bust a Move 2 version, or Bust a Groove.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
And then Emmy was one of the characters, and I did the DDR fourth mix version.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
But no one was my rage.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Sorry to hear it.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I also busted my knee-

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
You've got all the rage you need.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, thank you.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
I also busted my knee open doing a knee drop on a DDR fourth plus.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Fuck, that hurt.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
No, I didn't do fourth mix version, I did third mix version.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Did I? I had the hat. I had to go out, I paid more for the hat than I did the rest of the costume.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Alright, anyway, we're sidetracking, we're getting away-

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes, video games.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
We're getting away from your gaming week. Let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:24.000 --> 11:35.000
I didn't play much, because I just don't have a lot of time, so I played a little bit of South Park, and then I played some Call of Duty Modern Warfare last night. Modern Warfare 1.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
That's it?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That's it.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, and I got a little sidetracked, and I played 2048 a little bit.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh God, that game came up on Hoard House this week, and Grandpa was quite angry that he got addicted. He said he spent like four hours playing that game the other day.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I played 2048 as well this week, a little bit.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
You know what's funny? My highest score was just from making myself go in circles with the keyboard.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I was like, okay, screw this, I'm just gonna hit random keys.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And I'm like, oh great, yeah, I get the highest score from that.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Isn't that the same thing as that Threes game that's really big on iPhones? It's pretty much the same game, but just slightly different numbers or something?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
Alright. So very similar games. Yeah, 2048. I don't remember the website, but I'm sure you guys can Google it and find it, just like 2048 game.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
And yeah, it's this little free, simple little browser-based game where you try to match tiles together, and they create bigger numbers and powers of two.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, it's like Gabriel... just search for 2048. It's the first one that comes up. It's too hard to spell it.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Okay. Alright, well, that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, and I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit.

12:45.000 --> 12:55.000
I actually, and I don't know if you got around to touching this game, you know on last week's show we had Seg here, and he was pimping Dominique Pamplemousse was the game. I'm totally mispronouncing it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Dominique Pamplemousse.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Pamplemousse, which is French for cantaloupe or grapefruit or one of those, I guess.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
But I did play a little bit of that because he was nice enough to hook me up, so I played a little bit of that on Steam. I didn't get very far.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I installed it.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, I can't give you like a full review of the game, but I just can say, like remember we played the trailer last week, and I was like, this is kind of like an art film.

13:15.000 --> 13:25.000
It is very, it's very out there. That's not a bad thing. I'm just warning you. It's like black and white, this really weird like choppy stop motion animation thing.

13:25.000 --> 13:35.000
But, and plus the game is created where the character sings everything and all the supporting characters sing all the lines.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
And I'm really not sure what to think about that because it's not exactly melodic. It's a little bit out there.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
But it kind of, you can tell it really comes from the heart for that reason. It's like I'm really getting inside like somebody's head.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Like I'm really playing somebody's like psycho, well I shouldn't say psycho dream, but playing somebody's...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
You're playing their Silent Hill.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
No, no, because that implies it's like, it's not even about like scary things at all.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It's neurosis, no.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, it's more like I'm getting inside, I'm literally feeling like I'm getting inside somebody's head and it's a little bit, it's a little bit strange.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
It's, I think it's pretty cool.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, no, it's cool, but I'm just going to warn you guys, like when you hear point and click adventure game, you think, oh, it's like King's Quest or it's like Walking Dead or something.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
No, it's not really like any of that. It's, it's, it's really out there, but it's, it's, it's a trip worth taking if you've got the five bucks to spare.

14:23.000 --> 14:34.000
Um, other games that I've been playing this week besides things that we were pimping on last week's show, uh, more Final Fantasy 14, of course, and more Diablo 3, uh, still playing a bit of Diablo 3.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
I also checked out a little bit because I hadn't played this game yet somehow, Bejeweled 3. That's right, I'm going, I'm kicking it casual.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
Uh, Bejeweled 3 from the PopCap bundle, which is available through the Hubble bundle, which by, by the way, um, I didn't see it in our list of news.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I guess I'll bring up here somewhere.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There's a Sega bundle.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Is there a Sega bundle?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I got an email today about a Sega bundle.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 15:05.000
I'll have to look that up. Well, not to distract too much because this is actually pretty serious. PopCap, I guess, had some pretty serious layoffs today, which is a real bummer coming off of the, that bundle.

15:05.000 --> 15:19.000
I mean, all of that was going to charity. It's not like that was to, to, but it's like, uh, it sucks when you've got a company like PopCap that makes these really cool casual games and, you know, at least up until the time they got bought by EA, really felt like they were doing everything right.

15:19.000 --> 15:30.000
And even, even still, like, you know, people are excited about Garden Warfare and Plants vs Zombies 2 and Pagle 2, but it does seem like the PopCap factory isn't churning them out as fast as they used to.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And I'm not sure what's up with that.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah. They're not popping those caps as fast as they used to. And I don't know what's up with that.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
And now to hear about these layoffs and I don't, this isn't the first round I feel like that's been reported on for PopCap either.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
So it's, it's a real bummer.

15:45.000 --> 16:00.000
And, uh, I, I, I don't know. I don't know if something was mismanaged or what the hell's happened over there at PopCap, but I just, from the outside looking in, it really seems like y'all were better off before you got bought by EA, which is sadly a theme we've heard before.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, I've got the list of Sega games, by the way, which I might actually have to do this because there's something in here I want.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Are these classics games or new games?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Uh, some of them are classics.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
They're older games.

16:11.000 --> 16:30.000
Um, it's, uh, binary domain, renegade ops, 10 classic Sega Genesis games, medieval two total war, uh, shogun two, if you pay more than 15 bucks, um, hell yeah, wrath of the dead rabbit, Rome, total war.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
What the hell kind of games is Sega making? I haven't heard of that one.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Um, company of heroes, alpha protocol and typing of the dead overkill, which is worth it to me.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, that's worth it right there. Yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah. That's if you pay more than six, but I don't care about getting shogun. So I'll pay six bucks.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Hmm. All right. Well, that's cool. I didn't know that that bundle was out. That's pretty cool.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
It's worth it for typing of the dead.

16:50.000 --> 17:01.000
So anyway, yeah, I played bejeweled three tangent, but, uh, which, you know, is not that dissimilar from bejeweled one and two, but there is a, like an interesting quest mode where there's all these different types of puzzles.

17:01.000 --> 17:12.000
And like, so it kind of varies the match three format, which to be fair, candy crush saga was kind of trying to do that too with their game, but there, I really feel like there's so much, we weren't talking about them anymore.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
We're not, but I'm going to say something negative. Okay, good. Okay. It's done a lot better in bejeweled three and it doesn't involve microtransactions.

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
And I donated to charity instead of this website, pop caps, not run by assholes unless you count EA. Yes, exactly.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
Well now, and now it's kind of like they need the money except the humble bundle. I think a, the humble bundle thing's over and B it was all for charity anyway, but the charities need the money.

17:33.000 --> 17:42.000
So yes, there are kids with cancer out there. Keep an eye, keep an eye on, uh, and leukemia and hemophilia, which is awful.

17:42.000 --> 17:53.000
Lots of lots of houses. I don't want to talk about it right now. All right. Let's, uh, um, housekeeping real quick, of course, twitter.com slash O L R.

17:53.000 --> 18:04.000
And you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And, um, we will be back live again next week with our next episode, which would be five 45 if I haven't lost count.

18:04.000 --> 18:15.000
So, all right. Uh, you can't count. We're going to get into some gaming news. This thing's cool. What thing? Oh, I'm playing with Rob's light because I'm distracted.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
It's actually Allen's. It's like a little bookmark. This is awesome. It's like a, it's a reading light. Oh, great radio.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
All right. Uh, we're going to get into the news a little bit free form tonight. We don't have like a really harsh like list of everything, but, uh, dark soccer, I guess we'll start with you.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
What do you want to talk about? Sad stuff. All right. Stuff that makes my heart hurt because I love Namco and I love Homestuck.

18:37.000 --> 18:49.000
Um, basically, uh, Shifty Look, which is a Namco subsidiary that's basically just out there to promote some sleeping Namco characters, is going out of business.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
Um, they are completely closing down their game servers, closing down the, uh, the different, uh, comics.

18:57.000 --> 19:11.000
Bravo Man, uh, which is the game that they had released, is going to still be out, um, via the App Store and Google Play and the Amazon App Store, uh, until March 30th and it will still support, uh, purchases through March 16th.

19:11.000 --> 19:19.000
Namco High is closing down on June 30th, so that means I need to finish the game with everybody and then figure out how to save the Flash file because I'm going to keep playing it.

19:19.000 --> 19:32.000
Um, they still are going to play through with, uh, the release of Wonder Momo, uh, for the digital downloads, um, but that's about it. It's going to be going away. I have, I have much cry.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
And if you haven't played Namco High yet, freakin' play it. It's amazing.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
And you don't have much time left? Yeah, you only have till June, so play it.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Although, you're right, somebody will figure out how to grab that Flash file and put it on their own site or something.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Uh, was that the only news you had? Yeah, but I have sadness in my heart.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, that's fine. You take some time to recover.

19:53.000 --> 20:03.000
Um, let's see, I'm going to read one story here and then, then we'll let Loki do the rest. We'll give Loki all the hard work, but I was really excited to hear about this.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
So, Loki, I'm sorry if I'm taking this from your list, but I am so excited to hear that they have started, I don't usually get excited about Kickstarters.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
In fact, usually I, I kind of make a squinchy face at them, but I am very excited to hear that there is a Kickstarter for Frog Fractions 2.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh, Lord. No word if the subtitle is Electric Boogaloo, but I don't know if you guys have ever played the Flash game Frog Fractions.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It should be Electric Frog. I have not.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
It's, it's hilarious. All I'm going to say is that stick with Frog Fractions, because a lot of people play it for literally 30 seconds, as sometimes our gamer ADD does.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
Especially with older looking retro like type games will go like 30 seconds. Oh, remember this game? Haha.

20:40.000 --> 20:51.000
But like people are like, I don't get just, I'm telling you, stick with it and watch the banana start to peel because it's a funny game and it's worth sticking with.

20:51.000 --> 21:02.000
So yeah, Frog Fractions 2 is being Kickstarted and they're looking for $60,000 and the game is developed by Twinbeard is his name, although his name is actually Jim Crawford.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
By the way, he totally stocks Twitter for mentions of Frog Fractions because I get my tweets favorited all the time.

21:07.000 --> 21:21.000
Anytime I mention Frog Fractions in a positive light. But yeah, Frog Fractions is quote unquote edutainment, but it's so much more and you've got to see the video for the Kickstarter.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
It is, Loki, did you watch the video for the Kickstarter?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I did.

21:25.000 --> 21:39.000
Isn't it great? But what's also great about this, I think what's interesting about this, if I was reading it right, is that you don't get the game until the game is found.

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
Like the game has to actually be found, I think that was the impression I was getting, is that the game has to actually be found before everybody will actually get to play it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, because it's not actually called Frog Fractions.

21:50.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah, it's something else. But yeah, in Kickstarter he talks about if you figure out what it's named before the jig is up, you email him and he'll give you a code immediately for the game.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I bet it's getting jiggy with it.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I don't know, it could be anything. It could literally be anything with this game.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
It could be cowboy hat.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm assuming there's hints in the video, so you're going to have to watch it like 50 times closely.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
But yeah, Frog Fractions 2 is on Kickstarter and I'm very excited about that.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
I hope there's another, I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played Frog Fractions 1, but I hope there's certain modes that come back and certain ones that don't.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
I don't ever want to play another text adventure game. Anyway, that's actually not true.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Alright, Loki, what do you have for us?

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about Drive Club.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Drive Club, unfortunately, was a game that was supposed to be out at the launch of the PlayStation 4.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And then it got delayed. And then it got delayed again.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
And now it's been taken back to the drawing board.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
It isn't ready to be shipped and they don't have any sort of release date for it.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
That's too bad. It kind of looked cool.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
That's really weird and alarming in a way.

23:06.000 --> 23:15.000
Like, this game is going to come out! Oh my gosh, we're pushing it so far back we're not giving you a release date anymore.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, pretty much.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That almost talks about a full...

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
What studio was working on this game? Was it Santa Monica by chance?

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
No, it was a studio behind the Motorstorm series. I don't remember which one it was.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I was wondering if maybe it tied into the unfortunate news we had last week.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
What's that old saying? You'll forgive a game that's good even if it's late, but a bad game will always be bad?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Something like that. I'm totally hacking a Miyamoto quote or something.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Good enough.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah, good enough though. You get the point.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It was Evolution Studios was the one behind it.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Thank you. As long as the game is good, then people will forgive the delay, I suppose.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
But if they release it bad...

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
Although, wasn't this game supposed to be a free thing for PlayStation Plus people?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Well, they were going to have a stripped down version that was going to be free.

24:04.000 --> 24:12.000
It was almost like a free-to-play model where you could start off with a chunk of it and you can buy the rest if you want.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I wonder if that's all out the window this week.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
It might not be. You never know.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Alright.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
And then, let's see. Google, they just bought Green Throttle Games.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Now, if you're not familiar with Green Throttle Games, they put out these game controllers for Android.

24:34.000 --> 24:43.000
And it's actually the founder is Charles Huang, who was the co-creator of the Guitar Hero franchise.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I want to say we met him. I don't remember though.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
That name sounds very familiar.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Was that one of the people that came to your house, Jamie, that one time?

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
There was some guy. I don't remember if it was. I have to take away this guy.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I don't think so.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
No, I think that was the guy that co-founded Red Octane, though.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, Red Octane. Okay.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
And you might have met him at E3, back when they would be in Kensha Hall and stuff.

25:08.000 --> 25:16.000
Anyway, so they bought them up, so everyone's thinking, okay, what exactly do they need a controller company for?

25:16.000 --> 25:24.000
Well, the thought is, perhaps, it's going to be going into a Google set-top box or some sort of Android console, if you will.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
So it's very interesting to see what they're going to do with that.

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
Maybe they're just trying to beat Apple to the embedded console market.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
Because I have a feeling everyone thinks that Apple's going to try to do something with Apple TV,

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
now that they have standardized controllers and stuff, that they're going to try to almost turn it into a gaming console,

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
that maybe they're going to try to beat them to the punch.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I'm getting a little worried there's going to be too many cooks in the kitchen, though,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
because there's also the rumors that Amazon's cooking something up.

25:55.000 --> 26:03.000
And one of the big news stories that came out the day that we're recording the show is that Amazon is bumping up the price of Prime to $99,

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
which, when you consider it, I don't know about you guys, but I use the shit out of that two-day shipping,

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
and that is really special. Again, it has to do with costuming shows and props and things.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I think it saved my butt so many times. I really enjoy having that.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
But you've got to wonder if Amazon's not going to look to sweeten the pot a little bit and nullify that backlash,

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
because it is still, to go from $79 to $99, that's still a good, more than a 20% increase. That's a 25% increase.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah, and we use it. We share an account that has it, but we use it.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah, well, Alan and I get to share one, too, since we live in the same house.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
But still, you've got to wonder, they're going to sweeten the pot with some other things.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
And one of those is rumored to be some type of gaming-type service. Who knows? Who knows?

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Maybe. I don't know. I could see them doing something like that.

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
But I'm just worried there's too many cooks in the kitchen, because obviously you're going to have your Nintendo, your Sony, your Microsoft.

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
They all make the big box systems. Well, actually, I would say Nintendo to a lesser extent, a little bit.

27:03.000 --> 27:14.000
Sony and Microsoft really make those all-in-one hubs, whereas Nintendo's really trying to focus on their out-there hippie gaming system,

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
which some people love, some people hate, whatever. And then you have things like Ouya that are kind of like, I don't know,

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
they're sort of media hubs, but I don't even know what to define Ouya. It's cheap. It's a cheap alternative.

27:28.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, Ouya is basically just kind of a tablet redesigned. It's almost like a case mod for a tablet with a video out on it.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
I feel like that's what every other company wants to come after, is that cheap alternative.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
And we're going to be looking at $99 boxes from Amazon, from Google, from maybe even Apple,

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
although they might kind of be injecting it into their Apple TV thing.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
Still, it's kind of like, okay, I don't have room on my shelf for all this crap. Somebody's going to lose, ugly.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, I don't know how they're going to end up working that out.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
We'll see.

28:08.000 --> 28:19.000
And then, let's see. This was interesting. I actually saw this. I got a Kickstarter update from Kung Fury.

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
Apparently they are in talks with Tribute Games, the company that they do some really cool retro-style games.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
They have that Mercenary Kings that's coming out, and they're in talks and maybe doing some sort of game tied in with Kung Fury.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
Of course, it's still very early on that, but that'd be pretty awesome if that actually happened.

28:44.000 --> 28:58.000
Hmm. Let's see. Now this was interesting. I saw that Phil Spencer had been responding to the complaints about Games with Gold.

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
Basically people comparing that service and their selection of games to Playstation Plus.

29:06.000 --> 29:15.000
One of our issues with Games with Gold, not issues, but differences between the other system we get compared to,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
is the fact that Games with Gold, you get to keep the game regardless of whether it continues to subscribe.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
And the business around Games with Gold for us is just fundamentally different than some of the other programs that are out there,

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
which does put different financial picture on, you're going to go buy a game that's brand new,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
the cost of putting it in, or just to be kind of blunt about it.

29:36.000 --> 29:47.000
Now, here's the thing though. The reason that they're not being generous in the fact that they're giving you the game to purchase,

29:47.000 --> 29:55.000
it's because they don't have the infrastructure in place to allow you to limit renting the game, I guess,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
or being able to download the game only if you have gold.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
There's nothing in place to do that right now on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

30:01.000 --> 30:09.000
That's why they give you the game as a purchase. Otherwise they would probably go that route that they have with Playstation Plus.

30:09.000 --> 30:17.000
They just don't have that in place and they can't really, they're not going to pay you to add that in.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Wait, the structure is there to limit the download to somebody that only has gold,

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
but you're talking about the whole expiring and extending the license every time you sign in,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
and the things that Playstation does, that you can't do.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
Yeah, they have something in place where they can make something expire after a certain amount of time,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
so like for rentals they can do that because they do that with their video service,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
and I think they've done that with some demos before,

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
and they have the option to limit downloads to only gold subscribers.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
However, they can't say that, oh, when you become a silver, if you've downloaded it once,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
they can't say, oh, well, once you're silver you can't download that again.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
They don't have that in place. That's the problem.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
So I thought that was interesting that they're spinning it in a different way.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
Well, we let you keep these games. Well, yeah, because you don't have an option.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Because you have to. That's kind of funny.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Interesting.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah. Let's see. And then this was also kind of funny. I saw this and was like, okay, really?

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
Battlefield 4, you know, they've been having server problems since the game launched,

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
and it hasn't gotten any better, and it's been kind of terrible for the last, I don't know, however long.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
Well, now, apparently, they're going to start offering dedicated server rentals,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
like they did with Battlefield 3.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
What?

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, so, sure, our game's netcode's really terrible, but you can fix it if you pay us.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
So I thought that was just kind of interesting. It's like, fix your game first, and then sell something.

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
Just like they've been working on the expansions, but still haven't finished fixing all their netcode problems.

32:06.000 --> 32:13.000
Wow, that's so interesting that, you know, they're willing to just sell you a server when they can't.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
It's kind of, it's a little shady.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah.

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
And then, let's see, this is kind of cool. Smash Brothers, I remember that they were trying to get it into EVO,

32:25.000 --> 32:34.000
and finally it's been confirmed that Smash Brothers, or Super Smash Brothers Melee is going to be in the 2014 EVO tournament.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
And it's now officially in there, because I remember before they were having some issues with Nintendo,

32:39.000 --> 32:47.000
that, you know, they wanted in there, and they were delaying stuff, and I think it last year had to be, you know, pulled from it or something.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
But now I guess it's actually going to be in there, which will be kind of cool.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't know why they're, like, not supporting more of that type of stuff.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
You would think it would be good coverage for, I don't know, the new Smash Brothers canvas coming out?

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah. But it just goes to show that complaining a lot will get you somewhere.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Because, you know, everybody complained about the lack of that last year.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
So, bitching and internet petitions, sometimes they work.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
Usually only in the world of video games, though.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
And then there's a chance that Flappy Bird is going to be coming back.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Actually, the official Flappy Bird, not all the billions of clones that are taking its place.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
You mean such as flappy.vognetwork.com? Wink. Sparkle.

33:33.000 --> 33:43.000
Apparently, Dong Nian, he had an interview, I guess, and they were saying that he's not only possibly going to bring the game back with a message,

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
or I guess a warning message on it, but he is also working on three other games.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
One of which, he says, a cowboy-themed shooter with simple controls.

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
There's a vertical flyer named Kitty Jetpack. Techno Kitten Adventure much?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, that was the first place my mind went to.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
And an accident chess game called Check-A-Not.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
That sounds at least original, but the other one, whatever.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Haven't we had battle chess before?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Am I the only person that ever played battle chess?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Oh no, I played battle chess, too. Chinese chess.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
That was crazy, because it's totally a different game.

34:25.000 --> 34:33.000
Sort of tangency. I always wished that they had made the 3D battle chess, you know, like the three-layer chess from Star Trek.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Oh yeah.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
And a dental battle chess version of that with Klingons and everything. That would have been awesome.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
They'd probably have something like it in Star Trek Online or something.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
But battle chess could also be something like Archon, which I've done as a game of the week before.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
It could be where the pieces actually battle, who knows.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Yeah.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
That concept seems a little in-depth, though, for the types of games that Dong Luen's kind of been putting out.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Like, let's be real. Flappy Bird. Not a complicated concept.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
A kitten with a jetpack. If it's anything like either Techno Kitten Adventure or Jetpack Joyride or one of those...

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
Not a totally difficult concept to execute, so we'll see.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Yeah.

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
Let's see. And then I was going to say, there's this brand new Nintendo console coming out.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
Except it's not an official Nintendo console. It's actually a...

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
You know how they have all those third-party knockoff consoles?

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, now they have one called Analogue NT that's supposed to be coming out that it doesn't actually emulate the Nintendo.

35:32.000 --> 35:40.000
It actually uses real... I don't know if I guess real hardware to play the games.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
But it also has some different functionality with it.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
It's going to have an RGB output, so you're going to get improved visuals on everything, especially on newer TVs.

35:49.000 --> 35:59.000
Four-player functionality, Hi-Fi audio, and it's going to come in an aircraft aluminum case.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
So, it's kind of neat.

36:02.000 --> 36:12.000
I know that there's ways you can hack RGB into an NES and stuff, but this will actually be something that's built into it as opposed to a hack.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
So, looks kind of cool.

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
Bummer it can't be HDMI, though, because isn't the Retron 5 supposed to be HDMI whenever that finally comes out?

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
Well, RGB would be... you could do HDMI, because it would be like a VGA type of signal.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
Oh, I thought RGB... I don't know why. When you say RGB, my mind goes to component, because they are literally red, green, and blue cables.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
But why? It's an 8-bit system. Why?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because newer TVs...

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
No, why?

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
Because it looks better. Because the colors are better, and it actually looks like it should look like.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
But it doesn't matter.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Because you literally... like taking an Atari 2600, you cannot play on a TV these days.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Well, okay, you have to have a million adapters, and then they...

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
One adapter.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
But it's going to lose quality. It's going to lose quality going through an adapter.

36:59.000 --> 37:09.000
We hooked up our Atari 5200s to computer monitors with an S-video adapter that worked.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
It's interesting, though, because you can talk about... do you really want to enhance the picture of a...

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
I think I kind of see where you're getting, Darsyra, because when you enhance the picture of a classic gaming console, is it really classic gaming?

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
Because some of our memories with the Atari 2600 was like you were plugged into Channel 4.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Channel 3 or Channel 4, depending on your neighborhood, and you always had that TV noise that interfered with your game.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
But that's how it looked, man. That's how you played the game.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
And on top of that, having a lower quality sort of blurs the lines around the pixels a lot better.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
That's actually what some of the characters, their shape is programmed around TV blokes.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
I can actually see that argument, actually.

37:48.000 --> 37:58.000
So that's why I have a problem. I mean, we still have a 32-inch CRT, so if we want to, we can play our games on old systems.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
We saved the TV for that purpose, so we can play it the right way.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Until it breaks.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Until it breaks.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Knock on wood.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
Well, I was going to say, they actually have a website. The website that's selling has some side-by-side pictures of what it looks like.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
The RGB output and just the standard NES stuff.

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
I was trying to see if I could find that so I could link it to you guys, because it looks really cool.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
I just don't know. I don't know. I would have to see how expensive it would be or something, obviously.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
But, I don't know. It's a neat idea, I guess.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
It's still a way to get classic gaming back in people's living rooms, so it's cool.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
I think I'm a little more interested in Retron 5, even if it does involve emulation,

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
but just because of the sheer volume of consoles that it does in one box,

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
and the fact that it's very easy to hook into my current TV is a little bit alluring.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah. Okay.

39:00.000 --> 39:09.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, picture.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh, this is kind of neat. PlayStation Home's finally getting trophies.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Trophies for PlayStation Home?

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
Yeah, I guess you have a reason not to play PlayStation Home.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
Oh, also they brought back that quest thing you can do to unlock those PlayStation 1 games.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
They had something where you can unlock, what was it, Twisted Metal, Warhawk.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
I don't remember what else, but they had done that a while back, but yeah, it's going to have trophies now.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
Still weird to me that they never tried to do anything with Home on PlayStation 4.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Like, they're going to, if they don't announce something with PlayStation 4,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
then they're clearly going to pull the plug on PlayStation Home in the next couple of years.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
It's kind of interesting.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
It would look cool. I mean, it would be pretty sweet if they did something like that.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Especially now with everybody, like, having cameras and broadcasting and stuff,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
maybe you could have some sort of Twitch integration.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
Well, hold on. Jamie's still hovering on the analog thing you were talking about a minute ago.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
She's doing some research. How much are we talking for this thing?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
$649.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
What?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I know, right?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
What's it made out of? Titanium?

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
This is analog CMVS. Oh, never mind. This is the Neo Geo thing. That's all they had at their range.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Oh, Christ.

40:21.000 --> 40:29.000
They don't have the actual device up there for pre-order yet. It's supposed to be coming later this month.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Oh, well, $649 for a Neo Geo.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
That's not so bad.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
That's typical.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
That's not so bad.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
I'm actually going to email these people and see if they can give me any information.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Don't you know who I am? I want a discount.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Anything else, Logie?

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
There's one other thing. It's kind of sad.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
You may remember there was an Ouya game or a game that was debuting on Ouya.

40:59.000 --> 41:06.000
It was kind of like an art piece almost. It was called That Dragon Cancer,

41:06.000 --> 41:15.000
which was basically this guy, Ryan Green, and kind of his way of coping with the fact that his five-year-old son had terminal cancer.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Well, unfortunately, this morning his son died.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
But, yeah, quite sad. Actually, go check out the trailer and stuff.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
It is supposed to be debuting on Ouya, but I think it's coming to other platforms at some point.

41:29.000 --> 41:38.000
It was kind of they got in with that funding where they would back them double or whatever on Kickstarter.

41:38.000 --> 41:45.000
Also, it debuted on Ouya and was exclusive for a while, so that will be coming out.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
But it's basically, if you watch some of the development stuff about it,

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
it's kind of like the story of their son and all the stuff that he kind of suffered through and everything.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
So, pretty depressing.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh my gosh. Go to Costco and get some Kleenex when you're going to play that game.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
That's going to be a rough one.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
That will be a rough one, yeah.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, I feel like I have to kind of try to end things on a little bit more of a lighthearted note,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
although that was a very important story, Loki.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
I'm going to try and give you one more thing that at least maybe we can all have a good laugh here with a different story,

42:22.000 --> 42:29.000
and that is that the early reviews are in for Need for Speed, the movie, which comes out.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
By the time you guys already hear this, it will have already been out for the weekend,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
but for us it's out tomorrow.

42:34.000 --> 42:42.000
And early Metacritic score shows a 38 with 3 positive reviews and 11 negative reviews.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Let's see. Let's see.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
From the Austin Chronicles.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
From the start, Need for Speed smells like a movie in search of a franchise.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
On that count, it's somewhat fast, but seldom furious.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
Rolling Stone says there's nothing to distract you from a plot.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
So tired, there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
So in other words, it sounds like this movie is just...

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
And again, for movie critics especially that probably don't give two shits about the game,

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
it just sounds like it's just a ripoff of all the other racing movies, notably Fast and Furious.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Which didn't we call that?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Well, I think anybody could have called that, Jamie, unfortunately.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Video game movies, I know we had a...

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Who liked it?

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
We had a talk... The Dissolve is the name of the site, who gave it a 70, which is considered positive out of 100.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
Need for Speed modifies its outlaw anti-hero with all sorts of unnecessary pain and backstory,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
and the film is slow to leave the starting gate because of it.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
But once it does, Need for Speed becomes a much fleeter vehicle, powered by impressive practical stunt work,

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
eye-popping cross-country landscapes, and the sparking chemistry between Paul and Poots.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Imogen Poots is their name, I guess.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
It was kind of interesting that all the stunts in the movie are practical.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah, and so The Dissolve is basically saying, you know what, the graphics are really good.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
Let's see how many more racing metaphors we can fit into this review.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Lord.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Can we get a burnout movie now?

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
That would be... I want a good video game movie, is that too much to ask?

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
I just want a good one, I want one that's gonna get a good...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I've seen a good one, but it was animated.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
The Animal Crossing movie was really good. It was super cute.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Silent Hill wasn't bad. I like that.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Probably Silent Hill had a pretty bad Metacritic as well.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
So who knows, again, disclaimer, that's all Metacritic, and these are critics,

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
and popcorn audiences don't always agree with critics.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
So who knows, maybe Needs for Speed isn't all that terrible.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I think what we're gonna get into now, let's do the classic...

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
If that was all the news, that was all the news, right, Logie?

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah, there's... Seriously, I don't understand what the drama is with resolutions

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
and downgraded graphics and stuff like that.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
This week, with Watch Dogs, there was people complaining about downgraded graphics,

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
and now Dark Souls 2 saying that they were advertising this brand new lighting engine,

45:10.000 --> 45:18.000
and it was in the reveal that they showed in 2013, and also the Tokyo Game Show demo,

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
and even what they were showing, I guess, prior to launch,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
and then the game comes out and doesn't have it.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Well, maybe it was suffering performance.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
Maybe it was one thing on the dev kits and another when the game played.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
It's just lighting. Is the game fun, yes or no?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
I don't know. I haven't played it.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
I don't know.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
But, you know, people bitch about it.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
I installed lighting modes on Mass Effect 3, so...

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
They're even trying to get a Twitter campaign going to make Namco explain why.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
A change.org petition.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Is that the White House one where they have to respond if they get 100,000 signatures?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I think that's whitehouse.gov.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Whitehouse.gov.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
I don't know.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Just another internet petition.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
But, as we talked about with Smash Brothers before, it works. Sometimes it works.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
Hey, those petitions prove that there are people that work for this government that have a sense of humor.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
Alright, speaking of having a sense of humor, let's go to the classic game of the week.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
You know, back in the day, if a game sucked...

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
You were a sucker for buying it. There was really nothing you could do about it.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
But, yeah, we're gonna take a step into the gaming vault.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
Or maybe, actually, Dark Soccer might just reach into her pocket.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I'm gonna pick a game that's as old as me.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Alright. Dark Soccer's gonna pull a game out of her pocket.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
And it's the classic game of the week, which, by the way, we have no video for this this week because...

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Why?

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah, it's such an old game. Well, this makes Jason's job doing the YouTube very easy.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
I don't know. He'll probably find something.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
He'll find something.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Snake. Just Snake.

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
Basically, Snake began with a game called Blockade, which was developed by a company called Gremlin in 1976.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
And if I have to really fucking explain what Snake... Okay, fine.

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
Snake, you play a dot. And you move around, and you try not to run into your own ass.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Basically...

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
You don't want to eat your own ass, basically, is the goal of Snake.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Do not eat your own ass.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
I'm sure somewhere out there, there is a human centipede clone of that game.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
Hush, hush, hush, hush. No, no, no, no. Trauma. Trauma.

47:31.000 --> 47:39.000
So basically, as you keep going through different points, your tail grows longer until you really can run out of places to turn, and then you eat your own ass.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
And that's for failing the game. You die from ass overload.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
So anyway...

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Little bit of ass now and then.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Too much!

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
So anyway, as I said, it started with a game called Blockade that came out in 1976.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
1978. Atari did an unofficial port.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
And then they did a home console that's called Surround.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
So it actually was one of the Atari 2600 launch titles.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
And it was sold by Sears as Chase.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
And then Bally did a version that's called Checkmate.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
So the first personal computer version of it was called Worm.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
And that was done by Peter Trefanis on the TRS-80 computer.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
And then there were other versions that came out on the Commodore PET, the Apple II.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
And then there was another version that that same guy did called Hustle.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And then Milton Bradley released it later.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
There were versions on the BBC Micro.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
There were versions for MS-DOS called Nibbles.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Then it was a Cubasic sample program.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
We had an analog version called Anaconda that was included in Timesplitters 2.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
And then there's versions in Neopets called Mirka Chase.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Rob, did you ever play Mirka Chase?

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
I don't think so, no.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
I played some of those other games.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I mean, Surround on the 2600.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
I'm dating myself, but I remember playing that as a kid.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Well, it also used to have, and this was in Gmail until 2012.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
There was a version that was called Old Snakey.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And then came the Nokia phones.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
So basically, thanks to Nokia, Snake made a huge resurgence.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Hold up, though. Hold up, though. This is very important.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
Because you missed the most important version of Snake.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Shush, shush, shush, shush. No, I know.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Okay. All right.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I will go back to my text messaging.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Girl.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Anyways, so on the Nokia phone, there was Snake, which we all remember.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
We had Snake 2.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
We had Snake Xenia, or Xenzia, that was it. Snake Xenzia.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
That was on some of the color ones as well.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Snake EX on the color phones that looked kind of like Snake for the SNES.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
And you could play multiplayer through Bluetooth and infrared.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Ooh.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
There was Snakey X2.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Snakes, which is a 3D version for the N-Gage.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
Snake 3, which was another 3D version, where you played as a living Snake.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And then Snakes Subsonic.

50:13.000 --> 50:20.000
Also, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City said that the Nokia port of Snake

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
was one of 40 games that they wanted to add to the museum's collection.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
There are other games that are pretty similar, like the Light Cycles and Tron.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Uh, Nibbler Snafu for the Intellivision.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Thank you, by the way. That's what I was waiting for.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
No, no. There's more.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You missed the really important one.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.000
We also had Pizza Worm, Snake Bite for Apple II, Snake Ball on PS3,

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
and there was Space Ball on LG different phones.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
We have Snake for iOS 7, Snake Classic for iOS.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
So there's all these different versions, but now...

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
And the most important one that I can't believe you guys forgot.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
No, I didn't forget.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Let her finish.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Good lord.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Let her finish.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
We had Snake 360 and Snake 361 by YYR.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
There you go.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Good lord, can't I sue my segment?

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
No.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You're not doing it fast enough, yes.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
The most important one was next to Tron. Sorry, YYR.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
You know we love you here at OLR, but I do rank Tron's Light Bikes

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
above Snake 360 and 361, but you get a nice, solid silver medal.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Just saying.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
God.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Like I would fucking forget.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Oh my god.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Is that actually in the...

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
No, it's not.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
So I had to go find it because stupid article didn't even mention it, bastards.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
How rude.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Someone edit Wikipedia.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Alright.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
By the way, I would also like to add a happy note that has nothing to do with Snake.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Okay.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Today my husband found out he was hired for a new job, so he...

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Lord.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Did you just level up upon hearing this news?

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
No, that was Dan texting me.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Yeah, that's Dan's text message is the one-up sound from Super Mario Brothers.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
My hubby got hired at a new job.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Congrats.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
And he will be telling Radio Shack to bite his ass.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Just like Snake.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Like Snake.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Bite my snake, man.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I got a snake, man.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Nah.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Alright.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I'm not gonna be doing the Adam Sandler thing.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Is that it for the classic game?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Yeah, it is.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Now are you done?

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Are you sure you're finished?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Have you...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
You might be forgetting something.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Are you sure?

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Do not make me pick up my iPad here.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
My beautiful iPad of which I am loyal, loyal, loyal to.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Loki, are you satisfied with Dark Soccer's coverage of Snake?

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I think it's fine.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Alright, it's...

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
You know what?

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
I'm a strong woman and I don't have to answer to any men.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
It was like, this is nothing about women versus men, this is me versus you.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I know.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Hey, I can still pull the feminist thing on it.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Well, take your feminism and...

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
You know what?

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
Just for that, you have to buy me food.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
How the hell does that work out?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
Tacos, Rob, tacos.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I have to buy you food.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
No, I'll buy...

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Because you're feeling oppressed, so you want a taco.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
I'll buy my own food.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Thank you.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Anyway...

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I want Mongolian barbecue.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
I want, I want, gimme, gimme, me, me, I, I.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
I want the world.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
I want the whole world.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Alright.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
You know what I want?

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
I want people to send us emails because usually we would do the mailbag segment right here,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
but our mailbag was dried up.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
We got fuck all.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
There was nothing there.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
Uh, not even spam anymore, thank God, but if you want to send us an email for a future

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
show...

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Tell us, tell us about your favorite snake memory.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I don't want to know about your snake.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Participate at Orange...

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Keep it in your pants.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I don't need snakes.

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
But what we do have this week is that we have somewhat of a Fugal Question of the Week.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Inspire your Google.

54:07.000 --> 54:12.000
This week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and when you take those words

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
and you slam them together, you get Fugal.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
Instead of doing a little bit of, uh, you know, asking our listeners a question and

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
them giving us their best answers, we figured since this week was a bit of a special show

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
and we had a little more time to do something more freeform, we would do some Ask OrangeLounge.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Yay!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Yay!

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
So, we allowed the listeners on our Facebook and Google Plus communities to ask us whatever

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
they wanted to, and we're going to read some of these right now and answer them.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
So let's start with Google Plus.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Sure.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Alright.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Our friend Renee.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
I love Renee.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
She used to go by DNL.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Remember that?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Yes.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Love Renee.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
DNL Dreams, right?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Ah, that's right.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
DNL Dreams.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
It always makes me think of the soda.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
Renee wants to know, what are you looking forward to the most at GDC, and do you have

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
any predictions for announcements?

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
What are you looking forward to the most at a Game Developers Conference?

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
You know, I don't usually think of Game Developers Conference as a place for a lot of announcements.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
I still feel like it's, you know, it's more for the industry to kind of get together and

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
network and, you know, talk about development on that kind of level, not necessarily talk

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
about news.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
So my expectations are very, very, very low.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
However, I'm sure we've all heard about that buzz that Sony might unveil their Oculus Rift

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
competitor or, fingers crossed, maybe partnership, probably not.

55:30.000 --> 55:35.000
But there's that thought that Sony may announce something VR related, which wouldn't be out

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
of character for Sony to make a big announcement like that at GDC because Sony did announce

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
the move at GDC one year, and I think they've done something else there before.

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
So it would be neat to hear more about maybe how virtual reality will be coming to this

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
current generation of gaming, but I don't have that expectation because I'd be definitely

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
setting myself up for disappointment if I did.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
So, Loki, anything quickly that you can think of for GDC, what are you looking forward to?

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
Sony VR and more footage of Goat Simulator.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
More footage of Goat Simulator.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Good answer, good answer.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
You know what, Rene, I have another answer.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
I'm looking forward to some of my unemployed friends in the industry, especially after

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
all these layoffs we've heard about recently.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
You know, we just had PopCap today and Sony Santa Monica.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
I'm looking forward for them to be able to network and find themselves a new home.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
That's what I'm looking forward to.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Getting more talent back in the pool.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
That's my answer.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And Sony VR.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
All right.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
May I answer the question too?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Of course.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Maybe Mass Effect stuff.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
The end.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Never mind.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
And goats.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
You can't answer the question anymore.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I also second goat.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
All right.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
Dark Soccer, you can start with answering this one from Rettertainment.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
All right.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
Rettertainment says, there are people who deride the Mario franchise as a series of

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
semi-vague drug references.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
I am of the opinion that people who think that way are overly cynical and long out of

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
touch with their inner child.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Your thoughts?

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Yeah.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
They need to lighten up and stop being assholes.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Play some Mario and fucking like it.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
The Mario games are awesome.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
They are meant to stimulate that inner child in a non-perverted way.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Hand-eye coordination, right?

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Yes.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Apparently your dream is to be a prince, by the way.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
It is.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
My hand-eye coordination.

57:26.000 --> 57:34.000
Well, we don't care about that kind of hand-eye coordination.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
People need to get off their high horse.

57:36.000 --> 57:43.000
Just get off your high fussy flippin' high horse and just fucking let people enjoy a

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
damn game.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
If you don't like it, don't be a bitch about it.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Stop fussing.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
You can find drug references in anything if you want to look.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
I wasn't talking about drug references.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Let's talk about being perverted.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
But that's what he says.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
He says that Mario is a semi-vague drug references.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
I guess because, you know, mushrooms make you a bit...

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Come on.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
No.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
You can find drug references in anything.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
That has fucking nothing to do with drugs.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Mushrooms are good for you.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
You know, the name Orange Lawns Radio, totally a drug reference.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Mushrooms...

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Because, you know, we just lounge around and get high.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Mushrooms are high in protein.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
They make you grow stronger.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Mushrooms are good for you.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Not to mention medicinal.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But that doesn't mean you pick them out of the backyard and eat them.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
No.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
That's gross.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I mean, you can if you want to die or something or hallucinate.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I don't fucking care.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
This is what you get for getting me after work, Rob.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
All right.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
All right.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
Loki, is Mario a bunch of drug references?

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
No, they're not that clever.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
See, I was just focusing on the child thing.

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
By the way, Crazy Taxi is free right now on iOS.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Nice.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Let's make some crazy money.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Because that game wasn't drug influenced whatsoever.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
All right.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
We're gonna make some crazy money.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Take me to Kentucky.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Was it drug influenced?

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
And look, all the passengers want to go to, like, KFC and Pizza Hut.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
You know why?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Because they're high and they're hungry.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
Because Pepsi paid for that.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
All right.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
New question from Flaco Jones.

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
What would be on your wish list of improvements for a sequel to one of your favorite games?

59:21.000 --> 59:28.000
For example, I would like Ni No Kuni 2 to contain even more Ghibli animated cut scenes.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
And it would be awesome if they added couch co-op, similar to the way it works in Tales of Celia,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
where your friends can control the other party members during battle.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Isn't that kind of like Secret of Mana too?

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
But anyway, what is on your wish list of improvements to a sequel to one of your favorite games?

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Better Riding for the Next Mass Effect.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
And Bring Back Jennifer Hale.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Better Riding and Bring Back Jennifer Hale.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
And Garrus.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
All right.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Loki?

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
Saints Row. Saints Row 3 and Saints Row 4 were all a dream.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Go back to Saints Row 2.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Write Saints Row 3 and 4 out of the canon, all right?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
How are they going to make a new game?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
It's just so beyond ridiculous.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's the classic Matrix problem.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You gave Neo two main powers too early, and now where do you go from there?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You don't. You end the series.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I would say Saints Row 5, Saints in Space, but I guess they really already did that in Saints Row 4.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
They did that already. That was Saints Row 4.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I don't know then. I don't know then.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Let's see. My wish for improvements to a sequel for one of my favorite games,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I would like for The Guardian Legend 2 to exist.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That would be the list.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
That would be fantastic.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That would be my improvement I would like to make, because I would like that game to exist.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
It would still be fucking hard as fuck.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I would also like for maybe there to be like a Blaster Master sequel, like a proper one.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You go back and give me a real Blaster Master sequel, not like the Genesis thing or even that thing on the Wii,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
which wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't as good as it should have been.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Oh, I know. How about for the next Castlevania sequel, you go back to your roots.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That would be a good thing too, because it doesn't sound like this new one is selling well at all,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and I think there's a reason for that.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Or how about a crossover game?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You steal men's souls and make them your slave.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yes, I want bad voice acting in the next Castlevania game.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Why can't they have a crossover game with Samus and Simon Belmont, and then they can have Metroidvania?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It'd have to be Alucard, or Richter.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Why not?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
All right, let's go to Facebook.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We have some of the questions on Facebook.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
AZHP, you know him as our double gold star emailer, says,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
DarkSakura may be able to spot spelling and grammatical errors in our emails,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
but can she see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No, because that shit's nasty.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
DarkSakura is yet again wrong. That is my favorite breakfast cereal, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It's fake cinnamon. It doesn't have, it has some real cinnamon in it, but like,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
okay, you know the problem I have with fake cinnamon, right?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
What?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I can't deal with the smell, I can't deal with the taste,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and I actually think that I react, like, that's why I can't have that Fireball stuff,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
because it's fake cinnamon, or those little red hots, I can't have them either.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I can't have fake cinnamon, and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch just was, it smelled wrong to me,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and it just didn't taste anything like Cinnamon Toast.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
But it's like eating sugar cubes for breakfast.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I know, keep in mind when I was a kid-

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The problem with Cinnamon Toast Crunch is it loses all the cinnamon in the milk.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's just not good after, it turns into mush.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Dry though, fantastic.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
When I was a kid-

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I don't eat cereal with milk.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I ate Grape Nuts, in total.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Oh, you're weird.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And Cracklin' Oat Bran.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Those were my three favorite, I kid you not, those were my three favorite cereals as a kid.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Although, I do love me some Frosted Mini Wheats.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Now, I, okay, Frosted Mini Wheats to this day is my favorite cereal ever,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
but when I was a kid, as much as I loved those, I loved eating fucking Total and Grape Nuts and Cracklin' Oat Bran.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Grape Nuts aren't bad, actually.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Grape Nuts is awesome. Have you had it hot?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
No.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I finally got around to having it hot, and it was good.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Going back to what Loki was saying, remember, I don't eat cereal with milk.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Like, I don't do that. Like, I'm weird like that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm not the only person I've ever met that does it that way, though.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You know what I do with the Grape Nuts? There's more tangent about Grape Nuts.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I actually mix a little heavy whipping cream in it just enough to moisten it up,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and then I actually do add legit cinnamon and sugar to the top of it, and then I nuke it.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Cinnamon Toast Grape Nuts.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But it's actually cinnamon in it, real legit cinnamon.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Alright, Loki, anything else on breakfast cereal, or can I go to the next question?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I was gonna say that Honey Grahams are pretty awesome. Or Golden Grahams, I'm sorry.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Oh, Golden Grahams are pretty good.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
No, I also hate Cheerios.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Really?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
The only ones I like are the Honey Nut Cheerios.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Yeah, the Honey Nut ones are really good.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But I, like, hate regular Cheerios.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Frosted ones are good, too.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I know, yuck.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You ever had Crispix? That's my other favorite cereal.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I like Crispix.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Anyway.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And Chex.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Now I'm getting hungry from some cereal.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You know what? I'm low-carbing, so no.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Alright.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We have a series of questions from Ospher, who tailor-made a question for each of us.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You ready for this?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Ooh.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Starts with Dark Sakura.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Of course.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Dark Sakura from Ospher.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Have you ever watched the anime Higurashi no Naku Koro ni?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's pretty fantastic, and absolutely terrifying.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
To be honest, I actually have it downloaded. It's on my list.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
But right now, I am finishing up Gatchaman Crowds, and I have Kill La Kill on my list next.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I have just finished the first run of Shingeki no Kyojin and Claymore, so I'm sort of progressing.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
But right now, Gatchaman Crowds is what I'm finishing.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Which, by the way, is fucking weird, and has really nothing to do with Gatchaman other than, like, odd references.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So the answer to your question is no.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
No. But I have it. But I have it, and I will watch it.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It's on the to-do list.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It's on the list.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
All right. You guys should have a Skype party. You can watch it together.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
No.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
That'd be fun. All right.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
A question for me. Oh, boy.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Has your fear of dogs grown less over the years?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Also, do your hips not lie?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Do my hips not lie about what?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
It's bigness?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It's bigness?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Dear Rob's Hips, tell me a story.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Hi, I'm Rob's Hips, and I only tell the truth.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Feed me a donut.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That's the truth.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Did you hear Dunkin' Donuts is coming to Sacramento? I'm so fucking excited.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I really like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Cinnamon Toast Crunch is my favorite.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I don't know why my hips sound like that, but...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And I'm... Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm actually shaking in my chair when my hips talk.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's why I love you.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
You okay?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Shut up.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Let me get to the other question.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I blame Oscar for all this.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
My hips don't like to get bit by dogs either.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So, on a serious note, if you didn't know, I know I've talked about this on the show at some point before,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
but I have struggled since a very young age. I have had a fear of dogs.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And it goes back to when I was five years old, I was actually bit by a dog.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I was doing the thing a five-year-old kid would do, and I was riding my bike around the neighborhood,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and I tried to pet the dog, and the dog took a chunk out of my leg.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I make it sound more dramatic than it was, but when you're a five-year-old kid, that's sure what it felt like.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Everything is dramatic. Everything is terrible.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
My mom threw a fit, and I remember the whole, like, oh my God, you have rabies,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and just the whole fallout from that whole thing.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And granted, my mom's overreaction to the situation didn't help.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
However, the dog...

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Well, I mean, but at the same time, some neighbors' carelessness in letting their dog loose around the neighborhood biting a kid

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
probably drove her fucking nuts, so I do give her credit for that.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
But anyway, so yes, I've had a fear of dogs. It's mostly big dogs.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I'm getting better with small dogs.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Little yapper types?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Little yappers actually annoy the shit out of me still.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So that's different than fear, isn't it?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
No. If the dog shows their teeth, that's kind of the big fear for me.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So maybe your fear is dog dentistry.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Perhaps. I don't know. But, like, my grandma used to own poodles, and I didn't want to be near those things,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
because they always kind of, like, growl, and they show their teeth a lot.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But then, like, my other grandma on my dad's side had a little dachshund, and that thing was sweet, and never, you know, it was very quiet.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Which is weird, because they're kind of yapper, too.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah, no, not this one. And for real, I love corgis.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Corgis are the best.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So I'm getting better, especially with the smaller dogs.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I still, the big ones, like, for instance, you know, and I think she'd be okay if I talked about this on the air.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Jessica from Understation Live talks openly about her dog Chewbacca, which is a big, big doggy.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Big drooly dog.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah. And I'm getting better with Chewbacca.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Like, she still has the courtesy to put Chewbacca away if she knows I'm coming over, which is very nice.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But, you know, and I always feel bad, because I'm like, oh, God, she shouldn't have to do that, just because I've got issues, you know, or whatever.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm getting better with that. And it's just, I think it's just about, you really just kind of have to...

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm sure there's so many of you out there going, like, what, really? Rob's got, like, but I can't explain it to you guys.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Did you ever see One-Two, Will's dog?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Mm-mm.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah, I usually make sure that if he's over, and I know you're coming over, that I warn you about One-Two.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Right.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But she's a half-pit.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But she doesn't bark. She doesn't...

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
She tried to bite Midna once, but actually it was more that she was trying to play with Midna's tail while I was carrying her.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Other than that, she's like a sap.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000
The thing that really set me back was about six months ago, when I was going out to my car in the morning, and there was a giant dog in the parking lot,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
running around, not with a leash on, and of course, when a dog sees me, it runs up to me, and I literally flash back to being five years old.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And I thought the dog was going to attack me, and I, like, froze. I got, like, I freaked out.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I ran back to my apartment and slammed the door, and the dog was waiting outside for me, and it was like a scene out of a scary movie.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And I'm sure there's a lot of people sitting there going, this is ridiculous, but I can't tell you how much terror I felt that day.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And Tumblr listeners, I'm going to tell you right now, that's called a trigger.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Those things are legit.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yeah.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Being mildly uncomfortable by something is not a fucking trigger.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Having a full-on anxiety attack.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Or a meltdown is a fucking trigger.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I had a panic attack that morning.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So, stop using being mildly uncomfortable to describe a trigger.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You perfectly described an actual legit trigger.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So, and for the record, if I may, parents, if you have children, teach them to extend a hand to be smelled before touching an animal.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
All right. I got to move through this fast here, because we're running kind of late here, so I'm going to burn through the rest of these questions.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
But Osford did have one more for Loki.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Loki, what would you say is your favorite alcoholic beverage?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Uh, probably a screwdriver. That's all I really drink.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
All right. We're going to go lightning round with the rest of these questions. You ready?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
KJ, dear OLR crew, I have a question for you. Worst game ever. Go.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Uh, I blocked it from my memory.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Loki?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Oh, I do-

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Um, I'd probably say Yaris.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Um, I'm actually going to say WCW Thunder. That was really awful.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Candy Crush Saga.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Uh, Delvin, I would like to know the OLR's crew's thoughts on DLC.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Titanfall season passes $25. Ghost is getting a map pack for $15.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Is DLC becoming, starting to become a money grab?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
A way for developers to make a $60 game and then charge you for more content that they could have included or given you for free anyways.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What are your thoughts?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Delvin, in all honesty, this debate done already finished because we're still buying the DLC and this is kind of not a new thing anymore.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I bought all the ones for Mass Effect because it actually added something to the game.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Yeah, that's the thing. What is the $60 really buying you? I think that's the question you really have to ask in evaluating a game.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
All right, two more. Gaming Nerd says,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
How long before we get a Rob and Jamie podcast all about your favorite places to dine and foods you love to prepare and diet choices?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Next week.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I've got three podcasts. Isn't that enough?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I might do one just called The Tangent.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
All right, and lastly, and I'll throw this one to Loki because he hasn't got an answer on here.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Degenerate Johnny says, I would like to know if you have a preference towards red or white wine. If so, what is your favorite?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I hate wine.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
White wine for me.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You know what? I would have said red until Frivolo. And now it just is Frivolo.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
All right. All right. Well, we have to wrap up because it's getting late and it is a school night.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But we do want to thank you guys for tuning into the show tonight.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And even though it was kind of a shorter show, a little bit of an abbreviated show.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Thank you very much for your continued support of the show.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
You know, we ask, guys, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrie, please tell a friend or two about the show.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Help spread the word about independent podcasting.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And even if, for whatever reason, you didn't like the show here or you need something else to listen to for the other hour and a half you're not getting tonight, go listen to other independent podcasts.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Support independent podcasting.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And if you really like us, buy us dinner.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
We might go home with you.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
All right. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Potato bar tomorrow.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Potato bar.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
My final thought is moving in two days. Oh, boy.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Darsaka, your final thought?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Question everything and Mongolian barbecue.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
All right. That's going to do it for another week here of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
We'll be back live in just seven days to do it all over again.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Have a great week, everybody. Good night.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Tune in to VOG Network dot com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
See you next week.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Thanks for watching.
