00:00.000 --> 00:17.840
This week, GDC is come and gone and the future is bright for 2014. Microsoft has given a

00:17.840 --> 00:21.720
date for more of the Xbox One's release and the VR space is growing. Valve added a VR

00:21.720 --> 00:25.240
mode to Steam and Sony showed off its concept to GDC. All this and more on the show where

00:25.240 --> 00:31.720
every gamer has a voice.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.880 --> 00:41.080
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number

00:41.080 --> 00:52.100
545 for March 23, 2014 from our brand new studio N7. That's number 7. My name is Rob

00:52.100 --> 00:57.860
Roberts and joining me here in our new digs is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

00:57.860 --> 01:03.360
It's echoey. It is a little echoey. Hello from space. I'm hoping that doesn't get picked

01:03.360 --> 01:07.680
up by the mics too much but we might have to dampen the noise in here a little more

01:07.680 --> 01:13.200
because this is supposed to be like a dining room. I ain't dampening shit. I'm okay because

01:13.200 --> 01:16.880
people will fuss at me now that I've been doing it like I did it all of twice and then

01:16.880 --> 01:22.340
fussed out when I didn't do it the third time. So sup bitches. Sup. So do you like

01:22.340 --> 01:27.720
the new digs? I do. I do. I really like this door behind me that no one can see me just

01:27.720 --> 01:31.260
pointing to. I know because it is Orange Lounge Radio. I fucking love that door and I want

01:31.260 --> 01:37.160
to steal it. I'm taking that door home. Now by the way Jamie I have to apologize in advance

01:37.160 --> 01:41.380
tonight because I'm kind of stealing your M.O. I've been getting over a sinus infection

01:41.380 --> 01:47.660
the past few days which I know is usually your thing to be sick. Girl. No. So if I sound

01:47.660 --> 01:51.460
different that's not the new studio's fault. That is the fact that. That's Rob's disease.

01:51.460 --> 01:55.340
Yeah I'm actually getting over like I was really bad like this is I've had this since

01:55.340 --> 02:01.740
Tuesday and I still can't shake it. Well you know I've avoided my annual sinus infection,

02:01.740 --> 02:06.400
my sort of springtime infection because I found that there's a corticosteroid that's

02:06.400 --> 02:11.180
over the counter and I bought the fuck out of it. And now my face doesn't feel like death

02:11.180 --> 02:15.940
like it normally does right about now. Hooray. So. You stick it up your nose and you squeeze

02:15.940 --> 02:19.820
shit up there. That sounds gross. And then you snort it. That sounds gross. When I put

02:19.820 --> 02:25.140
it that way yeah it does. Alright well joining us not on the Skype line tonight but here

02:25.140 --> 02:31.820
in studio welcome back everybody tech master Loki live in the flesh. I'm I'm sitting here

02:31.820 --> 02:36.500
I'm trying to find spots on the carpet and the floor that aren't. Wobbly for the. Wobbly

02:36.500 --> 02:40.300
yes. Oh yeah good luck good luck with that. It's alright I think I figured it out. We

02:40.300 --> 02:44.060
got to get used to the new digs and break them in a little bit. Well welcome back. Yeah

02:44.060 --> 02:49.540
it's nice to actually be out of the kitchen. And in our kitchen. Well yeah it's it's it's

02:49.540 --> 02:54.660
such it's so hard to like like I feel like seriously it's like mute mute mute mute mute

02:54.660 --> 02:59.860
and just yeah yeah with all the kids and stuff in the background. So well I can make some

02:59.860 --> 03:05.300
extra noise or something if it helps. I've been reading about the saga of Screamy. Yep

03:05.300 --> 03:11.580
he also noticed what Captain Fuzzy Pants. I don't know about according to your lady.

03:11.580 --> 03:18.940
He likes to scream. Well I don't say he likes his colicky so he screams himself to sleep

03:18.940 --> 03:27.220
every night for a while which is why hopefully I'll be back next week because you know this

03:27.220 --> 03:31.020
is the first night that the wife's put. Well she has her mom coming over to help but this

03:31.020 --> 03:36.020
is the first time she's gonna be wrangling both kids at the same time you know. And so

03:36.020 --> 03:41.780
tonight's a trial run with. She's not entirely happy with that but I was like it's like well

03:41.780 --> 03:49.380
I'm gonna let you make this decision. I'm like I'm going sorry Nellie. But I'm like

03:49.380 --> 03:53.620
it's been four months. Yeah I was just gonna say how did you like Dark Soccer's Christmas

03:53.620 --> 03:58.860
present. You guys think I'm kidding but no he just opened it. Loki got to open his Christmas

03:58.860 --> 04:03.980
present finally. I like it it's great. Share the chocolate with Nellie it sounds like she needs

04:03.980 --> 04:08.020
it. Yeah there you go there you go butter her up with chocolate that always works. But you know

04:08.020 --> 04:13.220
what I have to say I'm glad for people who can do the kid thing. Oh yeah. So glad I don't have any.

04:13.220 --> 04:21.620
I have a cat. Yeah that's a you know parents my child is a cat. And Sanrio is finally getting

04:21.620 --> 04:25.300
used to this whole new house you know she hid behind the toilet for a day and I posted. She

04:25.300 --> 04:28.620
was trying to be one with the toilet. Well I posted that picture on Twitter where she was

04:28.860 --> 04:34.780
trying to hide under the litter box. She doesn't like to be around other people at all. But now

04:34.780 --> 04:39.900
she's kind of exploring a little more and actually she likes to jump up on the windowsill which was

04:39.900 --> 04:46.180
something we never had in the apartment. Kitty cats need sunshine. Yeah absolutely absolutely.

04:46.180 --> 04:51.460
Well believe it or not it is a show about video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle. We

04:51.460 --> 04:55.860
do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

04:55.900 --> 05:01.420
Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network. Live.vognetwork.com is the place where you can

05:01.420 --> 05:07.620
join us live if you want to chat along with our show tonight. And let's see going to going to

05:07.620 --> 05:13.500
our chat room VX Jason XV says I'm not hearing echo. Well that's a good thing. Jason would know.

05:13.500 --> 05:18.100
And by the way I'm glad Jason said something because this reminds me to acknowledge Jason

05:18.100 --> 05:23.340
because Jason has helped out Studio N7 from afar as well. You guys might remember now I'm not

05:23.340 --> 05:26.100
gonna promise this is gonna fix everything but you guys might remember especially if you're a

05:26.100 --> 05:30.900
live listener the show has a tendency to drop once in a while. Well Jason said I think I have

05:30.900 --> 05:35.940
an idea how to fix that. So he got us a brand new cable modem so we no longer have to rely on a

05:35.940 --> 05:40.660
rental from the cable company. So thank you Jason. Big round of applause for Jay. I mean as if he

05:40.660 --> 05:44.860
doesn't do enough for the show. It helps. That was very kind. I know going from like a rental modem

05:44.860 --> 05:50.500
to a you know my own modem it helps. Now that I said now that I said that we're gonna drop in

05:50.500 --> 05:56.260
five seconds. Dan and I invested in our own about a year ago. It made all the difference. Yeah so

05:56.260 --> 06:01.460
um well either way I appreciate the fact that I don't have to rent another one or the other one

06:01.460 --> 06:06.740
anymore I can just take it back so that'll be great. Tech 2030 in chat says it sounds a little

06:06.740 --> 06:10.580
different than the old studio. Well hopefully in a good way. We tried to rebalance the mics and

06:10.580 --> 06:15.500
everything. There's just not enough fuzzy furniture in the room that's why it's not yet. I think that

06:15.500 --> 06:21.620
my tablet just doesn't like the connection though because I keep popping in and out. Don't. Well

06:21.620 --> 06:27.540
we'll try to we'll try to work. Basted. Um Loki had a great idea though for the studio. We should

06:27.540 --> 06:32.140
get like try to go to a yard sale and get one of those really tacky orange couches and have it here

06:32.140 --> 06:35.780
on the side wall for the guests. Actually that's something that you can do yourself you know. What?

06:35.780 --> 06:39.500
If you can get a couch that's in decent shape all you have to do is buy the right kind of material

06:39.500 --> 06:44.140
and you can just sort of over upholster it. Yeah but like an or just even like put an orange throw

06:44.140 --> 06:48.300
on it or something. Well no I'd say over upholster it and you know make sure it's really good. But

06:48.300 --> 06:56.820
yeah I know how to do all that stuff. I'm crafty. There you go. Awesome. All right um let's see.

06:56.820 --> 07:02.740
Tech 2030 clarifies just different. I don't know how to explain it and saying it doesn't sound bad

07:02.740 --> 07:07.340
at all. Well that's good. I'm glad. I'm glad to hear things are in good shape. So listen it's a

07:07.380 --> 07:14.340
trade-off. You either get my crappy headset audio or you get a slight reverberation from the kind

07:14.340 --> 07:18.020
of empty room. Which we'll work on. We're gonna add more stuff in here and then. Speaking of which

07:18.020 --> 07:25.660
I got like I said I've got a a bar top arcade cabinet that I built that's just sitting collecting

07:25.660 --> 07:30.980
dust and one of the spare desks you know and my work. Also have a signed poster from True Crime

07:30.980 --> 07:36.220
New York signed by the entire voice cast that's framed. They just gave me the frame they're like

07:36.220 --> 07:41.220
I don't want to take that thing out of the frame. It frames yours now. I'm like okay cool. You know

07:41.220 --> 07:45.220
there's a night if we don't get that orange couch there's a nice spot here for either like an arcade

07:45.220 --> 07:49.980
machine or maybe a pinball machine. Maybe I can finally get that baby pac-man machine I've always

07:49.980 --> 07:56.980
wanted my entire life. You want to borrow World Cup? Don't get it. Don't tempt me. Come get it. No

07:56.980 --> 08:01.940
we were sticking with our three. Yeah no I don't blame you. No but we know how to get you into this

08:02.100 --> 08:06.940
but for the record this is not the time to get into pinball. Is it getting really expensive? It's

08:06.940 --> 08:12.220
been getting really expensive for the past two years like my when we got a jackpot we made a

08:12.220 --> 08:17.900
really good trade for it we traded our old what do we have before we traded something for it the

08:17.900 --> 08:26.060
the I think it was Black Knight 2000 is one of the things we traded for it but now like the

08:26.060 --> 08:31.660
Twilight Zone that we got the I think we got it for around three grand at the time easily is going

08:31.700 --> 08:38.420
for upwards of five and six so it's really really just appreciated since then. Gosh it's almost

08:38.420 --> 08:44.620
like the home market the pinball market you know. Try to do trades and work and learn to shop them

08:44.620 --> 08:49.900
and then pick up something light start trading up. Yeah I'm not interested in building up the

08:49.900 --> 08:54.140
massive collection well I mean well you guys don't have the massive collection. We had 13 at

08:54.140 --> 08:59.100
one time which is pretty decent. That's pretty we know a guy who has like 30 there's almost all the

08:59.100 --> 09:03.940
new Stearns. There's still a YouTube out there on our YouTube channel over at Orange Launch Radio

09:03.940 --> 09:10.740
on YouTube which by the way you know not only does Jason do the enhanced episodes of the show

09:10.740 --> 09:14.420
over there but if you go back in the archives a little bit we actually did a tour of Jamie's

09:14.420 --> 09:19.700
house a few years ago when she had all of those 13 tables so that was that was a really impressive

09:19.700 --> 09:25.060
site of course you don't live in the house anymore but no and we're probably gonna be moving before

09:25.220 --> 09:30.140
the years out we're gonna be looking for a new house but I guess I'm new today I got some new

09:30.140 --> 09:39.140
I got some new. Tell us about your new acquisition today. Well the the vibe my poor old vibe is gone.

09:39.140 --> 09:46.340
I have a Fiat now and it's blue it is very fucking blue and it's little and cute and I may have

09:46.340 --> 09:51.620
ordered an Alliance sticker for it because I didn't think the N7 sticker looked fine on it

09:51.620 --> 09:56.580
so since it's all blue it's gonna be I don't know what's call it either we were gonna call

09:56.580 --> 10:03.180
it the Ferrari at because Fiat owns Ferrari but they also in Dodge so then I guess not you can't

10:03.180 --> 10:09.900
have it all so I don't know. I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw by

10:09.900 --> 10:15.260
the way linked that video. As long as I'm not in it you can show it. You're in it. You're

10:15.300 --> 10:21.500
definitely in it but I'm looking at chat and the pagan Jew is in chat say who is my new

10:21.500 --> 10:25.220
friend I was gonna say I have not seen that name in chat before but I love I love that I love that

10:25.220 --> 10:30.740
name the pagan Jew says man I what I've always wanted are those table style miss pac-man it's

10:30.740 --> 10:35.420
like the cocktail table machines right yeah what how wouldn't you love that for a little table

10:35.420 --> 10:43.220
right here instead of well there is a tutorial out on building one of your own but building a

10:43.220 --> 10:48.860
coffee table size so that you have the middle part is the gaming area and the other you know

10:48.860 --> 10:53.740
places to set your drinks and stuff down on I just need to get a pac-man battle royale those

10:53.740 --> 11:02.580
are only what $5,000 you can swing it steam what steam oh just get downloaded on steam and run it

11:02.580 --> 11:08.500
on a computer or something yeah yeah yeah I got you I got you or or I'm sure you know I they can't

11:08.500 --> 11:14.340
be that sophisticated I'm sure that they'll dump it eventually for the record because the pagan

11:14.340 --> 11:22.020
Jew brought it up I actually did start thinking about calling my my little Fiat the Kodiak because

11:22.020 --> 11:29.100
it's the same color as the yeah too much Mass Effect it's a really pretty color though it

11:29.100 --> 11:35.700
really is it's little though like I think I would have to if like you and Alan were to both come

11:35.700 --> 11:40.340
with me in that car someone would have to sit sideways and backseat yeah Alan and I would not

11:40.340 --> 11:47.060
both fit in your car yeah it's little Dan fit in it but our buddy that we actually actually have a

11:47.060 --> 11:51.220
friend that works at car max that's where we got my car from he was like I'm gonna sit behind Jamie

11:51.220 --> 11:59.540
cuz Dan pushed the seat all the way and no so yeah all right well okay so we've talked about a

11:59.540 --> 12:04.220
lot of non gaming things we've talked about Loki's coming back to the show we've talked about our new

12:04.220 --> 12:08.500
studio we've talked about dark sacros car let's get back to what the show is all about it's video

12:08.500 --> 12:12.100
games and we're gonna start off talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

12:12.100 --> 12:15.940
have been playing this week so that you got a frame of reference where our heads are at this

12:15.940 --> 12:22.780
week with video games dark Sakura well I am playing through Mass Effect 3 again because and I'm gonna

12:22.780 --> 12:27.740
go ahead and put this out there for everybody if anyone besides me is doing mods and finds after

12:27.740 --> 12:33.900
you update your in video drivers that text mod and you mod are not working it actually is a

12:33.900 --> 12:40.220
conflict with the Nvidia drivers and I have put up old Nvidia drivers on Mass Effect thing I did it

12:40.220 --> 12:47.020
like two days ago so you can download run the old drivers and your mods will work again and text mod

12:47.020 --> 12:55.580
and you mod but I was I'm playing more Mass Effect 3 I'm trying to finish out run number 17 so that I

12:55.620 --> 13:00.580
can finish run number 18 I might actually just completely start over and make a completely

13:00.580 --> 13:07.100
different character I haven't decided yet I might actually finish the game with not with my weirdo

13:07.100 --> 13:15.500
albino Shepherd I don't know anyway so um I am also I started doing hunting logs on Final Fantasy

13:15.500 --> 13:23.740
17 17 fuck the fuck Wow 14 travel to the few yes I time child avatars no fort what the fuck is seven

13:23.740 --> 13:30.140
is all well I mean if you think about it 11 was an MMO 11 teen there was 12 13 and 14 is an MMO so

13:30.140 --> 13:36.540
15 16 17 will be the next MMO so maybe I do you know something Darcy are you did you just breach

13:36.540 --> 13:49.020
an NDA no I didn't anyway I meant 14 so whatevs um so anyway um I I I figured out I'm basically

13:49.020 --> 13:53.460
just running around doing as much of the hunting log as I can and I'm on the appropriate level for

13:53.500 --> 14:00.660
myself now like I am halfway through the hunting log the level for hunting log so that's really I'm

14:00.660 --> 14:07.780
happy I'm still playing Animal Crossing and I now have blue roses so if anyone wants blue roses I

14:07.780 --> 14:18.580
could be persuaded to turn on my game tonight and give one lucky person in chat who messages me

14:18.580 --> 14:26.160
first to blue roses if such a person desires and what's the big flippin deal about is they

14:26.160 --> 14:32.300
take fucking forever it took me an entire year to get hybrid Reds and then and I had to do perfect

14:32.300 --> 14:38.740
town to do it so now did you have to grind the bones of Ed in or yes I had to sacrifice Ed to

14:38.740 --> 14:45.260
the gods of my village no what you have to do is you have to you know you start off with your white

14:45.300 --> 14:49.980
red or yellow roses you have to breed orange roses then you have to breed purple roses then

14:49.980 --> 14:54.100
you have to breed purple and orange roses together to get a hybrid red and you have to have two hybrid

14:54.100 --> 14:59.460
Reds to eventually maybe breed a blue I have so many fucking flowers in my village but now I have

14:59.460 --> 15:09.940
like a big clutch of blue roses and so I in fact I will tell you what I will be kind enough to give

15:09.940 --> 15:15.220
two people in chat blue roses because I have enough to do that all right well there you go

15:15.220 --> 15:20.860
like reverse bachelor style or is that no they don't give them or they give them a rose of their

15:20.860 --> 15:24.660
stains yeah I don't watch the bachelors yeah they give him a rose of their study so it is bachelors

15:24.660 --> 15:29.100
there was a girl from Sacramento apparently on that show I heard and she got she got she got

15:29.100 --> 15:33.460
totally screwed over by the guy in the end that's what I heard but I hear all this stuff you know on

15:33.460 --> 15:37.860
the radios because I don't watch you know I like survivor and big bro I love Big Brother but that's

15:37.860 --> 15:42.540
about the most reality TV I was oh and RuPaul's Drag Race that's that's important too but RuPaul's

15:42.540 --> 15:47.060
RuPaul's Drag Race just transcends all other television they should get interesting like

15:47.060 --> 15:53.540
reality twists you know they think they're going on a show for bachelor but it's survivor haha well

15:53.540 --> 15:58.020
I always said that the best season of Survivor would be when they cast a bunch of drag queens

15:58.020 --> 16:05.580
I mean let's be real that's that is must-see TV right there come on now to tie it back to video

16:05.580 --> 16:09.660
games though have you ever have you ever played some of those video games based on TV there's

16:09.660 --> 16:14.460
like a bachelor video game on mobile oh yes there is on the Wii and there's yet that's right there

16:14.460 --> 16:18.380
was that and there's like a survivor video game also on the Wii and there well there was like an

16:18.380 --> 16:23.820
old-school one on PC they're all terrible they are so like how are they too bad how are these

16:23.820 --> 16:29.780
games so bad like in the licensing like well like at least like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy the game

16:29.780 --> 16:33.580
should press your luck like at least you know what you're gonna get you are gonna get those games and

16:33.620 --> 16:38.020
even though they might not be the most fluid presentation sometimes they work well enough

16:38.020 --> 16:44.820
for what they are but oh my god like Survivor is just bad it's so bad but anyway sorry I don't know

16:44.820 --> 16:48.260
how we got on a tangent somehow we were on Dark Soccer's gaming weeks just talking about blue

16:48.260 --> 16:52.420
roses did you did you get people to join your village yet I have two people and I am going to

16:52.420 --> 17:00.420
go plant two roses near my train station I mean sorry four roses near my train station and two

17:00.460 --> 17:04.740
are gonna be for acts deft and two will be for Queen Simeon there you go and then if you want

17:04.740 --> 17:08.740
to try and steal it from one of them get to her village quickly and start whapping people with

17:08.740 --> 17:14.540
bug nets and only the survivor will win all right Loki while she does that how was your gaming week

17:14.540 --> 17:21.580
didn't play that much this week I think I played a little bit South Park I played Call of Duty

17:21.580 --> 17:25.140
modern warfare 2 because I actually picked that up because we're kind of we were getting bored

17:25.180 --> 17:30.700
with just modern warfare 1 because we've played it before we actually started off in modern warfare

17:30.700 --> 17:35.700
1 then we moved to modern warfare 3 when we were playing on Xbox and then you know they wanted to

17:35.700 --> 17:40.380
kind of go back to modern warfare 1 because it was what we considered the best game that we played in

17:40.380 --> 17:44.420
the series so far well then I picked up modern warfare 2 and I think that's the best game in the

17:44.420 --> 17:50.380
series so far and then I started the grind you know because in modern warfare 1 I had the grind

17:50.380 --> 17:56.380
quite a bit just to get leveled up but apparently there's a lot of hackers on modern warfare 2 so it

17:56.380 --> 18:01.300
didn't take me it only took me five games before I got into a modded game and I'm already ranked 70

18:01.300 --> 18:07.940
now so hackers yeah my Xbox live game no it this is PlayStation Network and then you think no this

18:07.940 --> 18:14.860
is PlayStation Network I'm playing on PlayStation 3 right now so yes and sorry hackers on my internet

18:14.860 --> 18:19.980
thing but here's the thing though and like I don't really understand you know the point of it but

18:20.300 --> 18:27.700
it was kind of like generous but like I don't this is retarded at the same time because when he came

18:27.700 --> 18:31.500
in the first thing that happened was he ranked everybody up to seven unlocked everything so I'm

18:31.500 --> 18:35.780
like hey cool I got all my stuff unlocked and then he proceeded to kill everybody with an aimbot I'm

18:35.780 --> 18:41.540
like okay well this is I guess I guess I'll let you kill me the name but because you did rank me

18:41.540 --> 18:46.300
up to 70 but you know I just don't I don't know why I'm still in this game and eventually it

18:46.300 --> 18:51.860
actually the server detected that he was cheating and then kicked him off but the hell kinda like

18:51.860 --> 18:58.620
what is that I'm good I'm gonna bring you up up up up and then take you down I don't get it but

18:58.620 --> 19:03.860
I'm like hey cool now I made you and now I'm gonna break you snap it kind of sucks because I was

19:03.860 --> 19:07.940
enjoying you know kind of leveling up and grinding a little bit because I was you know enjoying you

19:07.940 --> 19:11.940
figuring out the classes and stuff and then they got ranked up to 70 I'm like well I don't need to

19:11.940 --> 19:17.820
play this anymore so I'll just wait until we play her actual private matches but technically I didn't

19:17.820 --> 19:24.180
cheat somebody else I benefited well this happened to my co-worker on modern warfare one he got

19:24.180 --> 19:31.300
ranked up to level 50 and so I you know he got everything unlocked because at one time I was

19:31.300 --> 19:36.260
like hey why is your clan tag marked as something and he's like I don't know I don't know how to

19:36.260 --> 19:43.220
change that so I played that I played more South Park the stick of truth and that game is hilarious

19:43.220 --> 19:54.620
and what else they play a little bit 2048 just because you know it's addicting and how what else

19:54.620 --> 20:01.900
I think that's actually it oh I played a little bit modern warfare one because we this Wednesday

20:01.900 --> 20:08.060
we actually played a private game but that's probably gonna be the end of that so yeah lots

20:08.060 --> 20:14.860
of modern warfare old modern warfare games and I don't know I don't have a lot of gaming time

20:14.860 --> 20:19.140
anymore so it's it's kind of limited to that with two kids you don't have gaming time what are you

20:19.140 --> 20:24.620
talking about oh yeah all right my gaming week I was also pressed for time a little bit this week

20:24.620 --> 20:29.080
with you know the whole moving thing and in trying to get everything wrapped up with the other

20:29.080 --> 20:34.280
apartment which finally took those keys over on Saturday and it felt so good to be rid of that

20:34.280 --> 20:40.560
but anyway I did fit in a little gaming time and one game that's been taking up quite a bit of my

20:40.560 --> 20:44.320
time besides besides Final Fantasy 14 that's always a given because I'm on a rating team in

20:44.320 --> 20:48.480
Final Fantasy 14 so I'm always playing that you know at least one or two two nights a week but

20:48.480 --> 20:54.160
I've been playing Diablo 3 again you know I know I've been talking about this on the show the past

20:54.160 --> 20:58.000
couple weeks but with the expansion coming out this this Tuesday is the big day for the expansion

20:58.520 --> 21:02.520
they were doing an experience boost they were doing 50% experience boost for a couple weeks

21:02.520 --> 21:07.120
well they up the ante for this weekend only and it's a hundred percent experience boost so it's

21:07.120 --> 21:12.080
like get my paragon levels get my paragon levels as fast I can because in Diablo if you didn't know

21:12.080 --> 21:17.400
you level your character from 1 to 60 and then in the expansion that's going to be 70 but once you

21:17.400 --> 21:22.000
hit max level you start grinding these things called paragon levels and the paragon levels go

21:22.000 --> 21:27.840
from 1 to 500 which I know seems like wow you can level your character to 500 it doesn't really work

21:27.840 --> 21:32.440
that way because the paragon levels all they do is they give you one stat boost and they rotate

21:32.440 --> 21:39.080
through four categories it's like offensive defensive utility and a potpourri I don't know

21:39.080 --> 21:43.840
there's some other thing but you you choose basically what you want to put your stats in

21:43.840 --> 21:47.840
in those but the cool thing about the paragon levels is that they are for all of your characters

21:47.840 --> 21:53.120
so let's say I am paragon level 26 which is where my character is at right now if I start a brand

21:53.160 --> 21:58.960
new character she'll be level 1 but character level or paragon level 26 so I can still put

21:58.960 --> 22:04.560
those 26 points and stat boosts into my level 1 character so that's pretty cool that's why a lot

22:04.560 --> 22:11.640
of people get 26 per character or is it just you know it's 26 per character but it's not I mean

22:11.640 --> 22:17.360
it's not the gigantic boost you it sounds like it is like 26 levels because like let me like okay

22:17.360 --> 22:22.480
it cycles through the four and one of them is offensive and so I keep putting my points in

22:22.480 --> 22:28.560
critical hit chance so each point is a tenth of a percent increase in critical hit chance so it's

22:28.560 --> 22:35.320
not okay so it's like the Borderlands 2 system that they have for experience awesome points or

22:35.320 --> 22:39.360
something I bet it is yeah I bet it's a very similar thing they probably won one probably

22:39.360 --> 22:43.800
borrowed from the other and probably yeah I would be surprised at all so that's that's a big thing

22:43.800 --> 22:49.040
everybody grinding because knowing that the expansion hits Tuesday now instead of paragon

22:49.040 --> 22:52.040
leveling everybody's gonna be taking their characters to level 70 but they'll be able

22:52.080 --> 22:57.240
to carry those paragon levels with them as they level through act 5 so it's you know people are

22:57.240 --> 23:03.480
very busy with that so been we have a clan for Horde house my other show so you know just finding

23:03.480 --> 23:07.080
other people to play with them their eyes they haven't given you a way to just pay to level up

23:07.080 --> 23:15.000
to 70 yeah right or giving you a free boost with the pre-order for the expansion none of that yet

23:15.000 --> 23:21.920
not yet not yet we can level up really fast now but anyway yeah also in Diablo news this week

23:21.960 --> 23:27.160
the auction house shut down so that is done so if you were staying away from Diablo 3 because

23:27.160 --> 23:31.720
you were waiting for the auction house to go away well here's a chance there's no more auction house

23:31.720 --> 23:36.600
the icon is still there because people can claim their items and cash out everything through like

23:36.600 --> 23:42.680
June but you can't list things anymore it's it's done so there you go so there's that the only

23:42.680 --> 23:49.280
thing that makes me a little sour face at Diablo 3 is I was reading the FAQ for the expansion and

23:49.280 --> 23:52.560
everything for the expansion on launch day and they're telling people what to expect and

23:52.560 --> 23:58.400
everything right and so if you remember when Diablo 3 originally launched everybody was

23:58.400 --> 24:02.920
hitting that error 37 right it was a big big thing and you know the game got a lot of shit

24:02.920 --> 24:08.280
because you know back when Diablo 2 did not have mandatory online I didn't have to deal with this

24:08.280 --> 24:15.560
fuckery well they're saying on the FAQ launch page you might hit a queue when logging into

24:15.640 --> 24:20.840
Diablo 3 and you know if you hit the queue just wait and you'll be able to attack the monster and

24:20.840 --> 24:27.480
I'm kind of thinking like that doesn't help the case that people do not like that this game has

24:27.480 --> 24:32.880
mandatory online which by the way is not a problem in the PlayStation and Xbox versions still don't

24:32.880 --> 24:38.520
know when the PlayStation 4 version is coming out but I imagine the holiday at this point they're

24:38.520 --> 24:42.160
gonna bundle it with the expand they're waiting for all the PC people to buy the expansion I

24:42.160 --> 24:46.280
thought they already they're gonna announce 30 or they said that the PlayStation 4 version was

24:46.280 --> 24:51.480
gonna be that you know with the reaper of souls and stuff in there is I how can it not at this

24:51.480 --> 24:55.960
point they may have but and I missed it but how can it not at this point but they wouldn't want

24:55.960 --> 24:59.440
to announce that because that's gonna cut into PC sales of the people who want to play it now

24:59.440 --> 25:03.880
so they're gonna wait until a month after and then they'll announce that the ps4 one officially

25:03.880 --> 25:10.640
has both well watch I've been following Blizzard way too long it's exactly how it's gonna go down

25:11.600 --> 25:17.520
so anyway God where was I with that whole mess yeah oh yes there's gonna be a queue to possibly

25:17.520 --> 25:21.760
get into Diablo thumbs yeah a little a little ridiculous a little ridiculous so I am making

25:21.760 --> 25:26.680
a little bit of stank face at the game for that but I'm also not the type of Diablo player where

25:26.680 --> 25:32.360
I have to be in there day one like I'm not like that big on it so if I can't play right away then

25:32.360 --> 25:37.480
what else I'm not not worried about it one other game I've been playing this week and I think a lot

25:37.480 --> 25:41.200
of you all you all out there have been playing this as well I have been playing the Final Fantasy

25:41.200 --> 25:47.640
10 HD remaster which does include 10 2 but I've only been playing 10 because you know I want to

25:47.640 --> 25:55.040
play that first huh what what can I do for you no I'm not playing 10 2 yet I'm playing playing just

25:55.040 --> 26:02.520
10 right now but um I it is what you would expect it is Final Fantasy 10 but it's in widescreen and

26:02.520 --> 26:07.080
with with up bridge graphics you know Alan walked in when I was playing and he's like I can't really

26:07.180 --> 26:11.760
tell the difference I could though like and I don't know if that's just the quality of TV has

26:11.760 --> 26:15.880
gone up in the 10 years or no longer than that probably 15 years since Final Fantasy 10 was first

26:15.880 --> 26:23.360
out but just like I'm like the colors are more vibrant things just look crisper and better this

26:23.360 --> 26:28.120
soundtrack has been redone a little bit and I don't find the redo the redos of the songs are

26:28.120 --> 26:34.000
faithful to the originals they didn't like like completely screw up the chocobo music or anything

26:34.080 --> 26:40.040
like that like everything still stays faithful to the original the only thing I don't remember the

26:40.040 --> 26:45.760
loading times being such a bear in the Final Fantasy 10 version on PlayStation 2 or loading

26:45.760 --> 26:53.400
times yeah oh yeah like you know and it's just the put in the disc launch the game oh okay now

26:53.400 --> 26:58.400
I'm on the main menu where I choose which game do I want to play all right pick FF 10 loading

26:58.400 --> 27:04.160
all right gonna click load game loading gonna load my game loading this is kind of like all right

27:04.160 --> 27:07.640
there's a lot of loading screens here and I was kind of surprised didn't do any type of like

27:07.640 --> 27:12.000
install or anything to try and maybe minimize that a little bit but that's like my one little

27:12.000 --> 27:17.720
bitch and you know what to be honest maybe it was that way and I just forgot after all these years

27:17.720 --> 27:22.320
but I felt like on PlayStation 2 it seemed like I kind of got in there a little faster and got to

27:22.320 --> 27:29.000
play my game or as you know you gotta say say your time aside go get your drink and your sandwich

27:29.000 --> 27:34.920
before you play your game but that's my one one minor little bitch with Final Fantasy 10 otherwise

27:34.920 --> 27:40.800
it's it's a great deal especially if you know I realized we have a lot of listeners that are

27:40.800 --> 27:45.840
probably like 18 to 21 you know kind of in that range so you were probably too young when Final

27:45.840 --> 27:50.080
Fantasy 10 first came out and maybe you've gone back and experienced it which you know thumbs up

27:50.080 --> 27:55.440
good for you but if you somehow miss these games but you do kind of like Japanese RPGs and you like

27:55.440 --> 27:59.080
those types of games or you're interested in them I think this is a great way to pick them up you

27:59.080 --> 28:04.160
know it's only what it's like 40 bucks for the two games it's that's a great deal and it's not only

28:04.160 --> 28:08.680
the two games they are the international versions for the first time in America so that's pretty

28:08.680 --> 28:12.960
cool because you can do the alternate sphere grid I had I have the international version for

28:12.960 --> 28:20.160
10-2 so okay there you go but you had to import that right yeah yeah I did but it played just

28:20.160 --> 28:26.080
fine it also comes with the audio drama that plays over some credits there was like a Final

28:26.080 --> 28:31.520
Fantasy 10 audio drama or something that came after 10-2 and then there's a another Final

28:31.520 --> 28:37.280
Fantasy 10 like extended movie or something or is there am I thinking last mission oh no there's

28:37.280 --> 28:43.360
like every bonus that goes with Final Fantasy 10 is all there I mean it's all with it I'm trying

28:43.360 --> 28:47.720
to be that guy who goes through and plays one at a time but if it goes anything like Kingdom Hearts

28:47.720 --> 28:52.160
did I'll get like a quarter of the way through the game and then be like oh my South Park game

28:52.160 --> 29:00.640
is here time to go play that because I'm waiting on that now so it's fantastic yeah I'm going to

29:00.640 --> 29:06.240
the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com act deft and chat says Final Fantasy 10 sucks anyway well

29:06.240 --> 29:13.360
you know what that's what I have to say Syal in chat says I'll play Diablo 3 when offline mode

29:13.360 --> 29:19.880
becomes a thing the PlayStation 3 version or Xbox 360 version are for you offline mode is a thing

29:19.880 --> 29:26.560
in those games if you're curious so there you go s2100 Matt says kind of reminds me of the horrible

29:26.560 --> 29:30.840
loading times for the Final Fantasy Chronicles disc Final Fantasy 4 and chrono trigger for ps1

29:30.840 --> 29:35.760
well here's the good news it doesn't load for like battles and things like that I mean that

29:35.800 --> 29:40.920
feels fluid like that was the annoying pain in the ass thing about those was like every time you

29:40.920 --> 29:44.840
got into a random battle there was like a little loading time that was a bit much on those like old

29:44.840 --> 29:50.080
PlayStation games but you don't you don't have that here it's not that bad so all right so that's

29:50.080 --> 29:56.800
gonna do it for our gaming weeks so quickly our housekeeping I don't have a whole lot to say here

29:56.800 --> 30:02.400
since you know we had our week off last week but I hope you got y'all enjoyed the tape show that we

30:02.400 --> 30:07.280
ran over Loki's budgeted time sorry about that but we made it work sorry it was the baby crying

30:07.280 --> 30:12.320
I understand but I'm glad we were able to do something for the listeners I saw there were a

30:12.320 --> 30:16.080
lot of people that use the passphrase that's hidden in the show to check in so I know a lot

30:16.080 --> 30:20.040
of you guys were checking it out one way or another so I'm glad we could do a little something for you

30:20.040 --> 30:25.320
guys but now we're back to our form and and hopefully coming at you for the next next many

30:25.320 --> 30:31.800
few weeks here solid twitter.com slash olr facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google.com

30:31.800 --> 30:36.640
slash plus orange lounge radio all the different ways you can follow us on social media I should

30:36.640 --> 30:41.760
throw this little a little teaser out there too we are thinking about what we're gonna do for a

30:41.760 --> 30:46.440
new look at orange lounge radio.com because you know we've had that old website that we've kind

30:46.440 --> 30:51.440
of neglected a little bit ever since vog network launched because a lot of the focus has been over

30:51.440 --> 30:55.680
there and with good reason but we are gonna kind of take a look at what can we do to orange

30:55.680 --> 31:00.160
lounge radio.com to kind of make it a real central hub for show related things and more

31:00.160 --> 31:04.640
info about the show and you know the fact that this show does have a 12 year history behind it

31:04.640 --> 31:09.040
and counting so you know kind of some of the historical things for our show and what we can

31:09.040 --> 31:16.040
put on there so we're old don't remind me you know what these posters these posters keep me young you

31:16.040 --> 31:20.920
see that that is some of these posters are older than some of our listeners that's a DDR second

31:20.920 --> 31:27.040
mix marquee which which of these posters would be older than one of our listeners maybe the second

31:27.040 --> 31:32.240
mix marquee second mix marquee that would be for one of the Silent Hill 3 poster baby I don't know

31:32.240 --> 31:39.720
I would hope I would hope we don't have 12 11 come out it was 2005 so you were doing second mix yeah

31:39.720 --> 31:48.360
anyway cloud here on a wall scroll um to give the visual to you guys there will I will probably do

31:48.360 --> 31:53.520
a YouTube of it I'll do like a little YouTube to put for the channel and and have Jason make it

31:53.520 --> 31:57.560
nice if he's willing to do that and put it up on our channels that way you guys can go check out

31:57.560 --> 32:02.240
our YouTube channel we'll give you a little visual look of our studio once once we get a little more

32:02.240 --> 32:09.920
in here I think it'll be really ready to show off so yeah there you go um okay so let's get into our

32:09.920 --> 32:15.600
gaming news tonight Loki once you start us off so it was rumored that they were gonna do this and

32:15.640 --> 32:23.920
of course they did it so Sony kind of announced their codenamed project Morpheus what that is is

32:23.920 --> 32:30.960
basically their VR headset and spec wise it sounds kind of similar to the oculus rift it's you know

32:30.960 --> 32:43.800
1080p 90 plus degrees field of view also kind of utilizes the PlayStation camera I guess it

32:43.840 --> 32:50.960
sort of has like the same move motion sensors built into it and of course a bunch of support

32:50.960 --> 32:56.240
from all sorts of middleware and development companies that unity havoc you know epic games

32:56.240 --> 33:06.720
Autodesk crytek you know all the big guys and of course no information on price no information on

33:06.720 --> 33:12.240
release date or anything like that they did show off some tech demos utilizing games that are

33:12.240 --> 33:19.040
already out there like thief looks interesting I mean I'm kind of excited about VR actually

33:19.040 --> 33:23.720
coming mainstream to consoles my only concern of course with anything that you know you have

33:23.720 --> 33:29.600
like a new technology is the first few games that come out for it are gonna be very gimmicky

33:29.600 --> 33:36.600
it's just like I don't know like even with the 3d stuff on the 3ds or with the motion controls

33:36.600 --> 33:43.080
on the Wii and even the second screen on the DS it was just gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick this

33:43.080 --> 33:47.320
isn't really needed oh hey or hate the Kinect any games that have come out for the Kinect they

33:47.320 --> 33:51.440
haven't been dancing game and pretty much gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick so that's the only thing

33:51.440 --> 33:56.200
I'm concerned about and probably price point because you know that's really expensive then

33:56.200 --> 34:00.640
I don't really want to buy it well the cost of the technology may come down a little bit though

34:00.640 --> 34:04.400
by the time this thing actually comes out I mean I really don't think you guys should expect to see

34:04.400 --> 34:08.800
it this year I think we're talking out there I think they even said not this year yeah holiday

34:08.800 --> 34:15.120
2015 maybe I mean and you guys have to remember it is game developers conference this announcement

34:15.120 --> 34:19.520
was not an e3 type of announcement and that's where some people you know and Bobby gets into

34:19.520 --> 34:23.400
this a lot more on his show where he you know and he kind of has that perspective because he does

34:23.400 --> 34:27.920
develop games like flappy vlog and all that right so he does kind of have that perspective and and

34:27.920 --> 34:33.080
that game developers conference is not e3 and we kind of have to remember that sometimes we get

34:33.080 --> 34:37.800
thrown little tidbits you get thrown little things and you know to try and get excitement

34:37.800 --> 34:41.880
and sure ever everybody wants the media to report on them so sometimes you're gonna get a little

34:41.880 --> 34:46.120
bone thrown at you but you have to remember the news isn't really for you and something like this

34:46.120 --> 34:52.360
especially for Sony to kind of say all right we are gonna do this for the PlayStation 4 can get

34:52.360 --> 34:56.280
developers thinking all right what kind of game do I want to make because you can't really make

34:56.280 --> 35:02.360
a PlayStation 4 game overnight you know people are working on now the stuff that's gonna come out

35:02.360 --> 35:07.640
holiday 2015 holiday 2016 for heaven's sake you know things that are way way out that's how long

35:07.640 --> 35:12.560
a video game takes to make so I mean by kind of announcing this publicly to the developers now

35:12.560 --> 35:17.720
it's kind of like all right no more of this leaked stuff we all know this is something we're working

35:17.720 --> 35:22.560
on here's the specs and you know good luck have fun with it I would love to see like something

35:22.560 --> 35:26.960
like this being patched into like currently you know like games that are already out there even

35:26.960 --> 35:31.000
like re-releasing them with this kind of like how they do with kind of the move stuff obviously you

35:31.000 --> 35:37.120
know adding motion controls versus adding you know a whole second camera to make it stereoscopic

35:37.120 --> 35:41.680
and all that stuff and head tracking and all that it's a lot more complicated but it'd be kind of

35:41.680 --> 35:46.560
cool you know to be able to play like say Killzone or something like that in VR or even Minecraft in

35:46.560 --> 35:52.840
VR I mean cuz obviously the oculus rift version was pretty cool so I would like to try that and

35:52.840 --> 35:57.360
also you know if the price point is nice I'm going to our chat room real quick real quick

35:57.680 --> 36:02.680
Ragingator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says will project Morpheus offer users the choice of

36:02.680 --> 36:08.640
a red pill or a blue pill hahaha well let us not let us not forget project Morpheus won't be the

36:08.640 --> 36:13.800
final name I mean there's all there's development names all the time yeah we're still playing the

36:13.800 --> 36:19.000
revolution in ultra 64 y'all right yeah besides the project Morpheus that's something more I'd

36:19.000 --> 36:29.400
see associated with the one fuck off all right but speaking of the choice I hate you so much go

36:29.400 --> 36:33.680
back home all right I'm kidding all right it is good to have you back speaking of the choice

36:33.680 --> 36:39.080
between the red pill and the blue pill now users are gonna be faced with a choice between project

36:39.080 --> 36:44.800
Morpheus and oculus rift or are they and then also there's you know Microsoft what they're coming out

36:44.800 --> 36:49.120
with remember that there's this whole roadmap thing that leaked out I want to say is it been

36:49.120 --> 36:55.680
a year or two years now you know talking about the whole you know Kinect and Xbox one and you know

36:55.680 --> 37:01.680
this whole project for tell fortaleza which I guess they're singing translates to fortress in

37:01.680 --> 37:05.880
Portuguese if I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean but they're saying it's supposed

37:05.880 --> 37:11.440
to be like some sort of like augmented reality of VR type thing and it's something that they're

37:11.440 --> 37:16.400
apparently working on this is now also being confirmed by like I guess a second source now

37:16.400 --> 37:20.400
it's whatever happened to the the luma room thing that Microsoft was doing I thought that was their

37:20.400 --> 37:27.440
thing um no that was something else but it apparently is just too costly right now with

37:27.440 --> 37:32.520
you know what's out there I mean how you're asking someone to basically set up a projector

37:32.520 --> 37:38.920
that's gonna project stuff on the walls I mean that sounds cool but it's just it's too expensive

37:38.920 --> 37:44.280
and just imagine trying to sell that you need a very specific room for that it's just not something

37:44.280 --> 37:50.040
that anybody could do I mean it'd be neat if they can actually do that and pull it off well now wait

37:50.040 --> 37:53.800
a minute you dodged my question let's go back are you gonna are you do you feel like you're gonna

37:53.800 --> 37:59.000
have to make a choice between oculus rift and project Morpheus or do you think there's room in

37:59.000 --> 38:05.360
a gamer's house for both depends on the price and just you know once again like I haven't really been

38:05.360 --> 38:14.160
jumping into just buying you know a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one or even a new gaming PC I'm just

38:14.160 --> 38:20.120
gotta see what's gonna be for it I'm not gonna just jump in and buy you know a new console and

38:20.120 --> 38:27.520
like you know $200 plus device and you know what were they gonna support with it I mean what kind

38:27.520 --> 38:31.840
of games are gonna see cuz remember you know we did this with like the Kinect and stuff like oh

38:31.920 --> 38:35.840
you need to get the Kinect to play all these games and then it's very limited way you can play it's

38:35.840 --> 38:40.320
like okay I can play dancing games or I can play games that implement Kinect for really stupid

38:40.320 --> 38:45.360
reasons you know you know I don't know it I gotta wait and see what they have for it I mean I think

38:45.360 --> 38:51.240
I'd hope with VR that there's gonna be some cooler stuff with it but it's all gonna be also how

38:51.240 --> 38:55.160
sensitive everything is you know is it gonna be able to pick up movements out you know obviously

38:55.160 --> 38:59.800
with this these newer cameras and stuff they're a lot better than the original connector even the

38:59.800 --> 39:06.160
PlayStation I was so I'm hoping that it will be a better experience but I have to see that I have

39:06.160 --> 39:14.480
to see the reviews games all that stuff for me even though I I get the competitions healthy and

39:14.480 --> 39:18.700
I think that'll be kind of a good thing in this case you know and I get that they are and they

39:18.700 --> 39:23.680
aren't competing I mean the PC market and the console market are very different right and the

39:23.680 --> 39:28.420
things that are gonna be good for oculus rift on PC versus Morpheus on ps4 is just like back to

39:28.420 --> 39:33.820
those same adages about PlayStation 4 I see about console gaming in general versus PC gaming is that

39:33.820 --> 39:37.780
you know with console gaming you have your sets of standards and you never have to worry about

39:37.780 --> 39:42.740
that but at the same time you are stuck within those standards whereas PCs can kind of always

39:42.740 --> 39:46.780
continuously upgrade right so that's you know there's gonna be pros and cons between the two

39:46.780 --> 39:51.860
you know whatever and I'm sure you're gonna see some game overlap between the two for me the the

39:51.860 --> 39:57.660
honest-to-god thing I'm having a hard time conceptualizing is how why would I want two

39:57.660 --> 40:04.660
VR headsets in my house and maybe this is just like a I'm not like like I'm sure there was a

40:04.660 --> 40:10.700
time in a day where people were going like you mean I need to have a Nintendo and a Sega in my

40:10.700 --> 40:16.300
house I don't need both right or even way back in the day I need to have two television sets in my

40:16.300 --> 40:22.620
house what am I gonna do with two television sets I only need one so maybe that's just I you know

40:22.620 --> 40:26.860
again once like all the games are there it might but I just right now I'm like I don't want to buy

40:26.860 --> 40:33.220
two VR sets the thing is like you know I kind of view a VR set is almost like having a TV it's like

40:33.220 --> 40:38.900
well this is stupid that I should have a second TV to play a second game system on one this TV

40:38.900 --> 40:42.660
could easily play both game systems they should just be able to switch back and forth and here's

40:42.660 --> 40:47.740
the thing like they're even talking with the other project Morpheus headset they have a game

40:47.740 --> 40:54.940
with the Eve Valkyrie I think is what it was that is a game that's being co-published by oculus so

40:54.940 --> 40:59.500
that's kind of interesting right there that there's a little bit I don't know if it's being done by a

40:59.500 --> 41:06.540
different company for you know for the PlayStation 4 but the fact that that's also coming to this

41:06.540 --> 41:12.180
head says well it's like it would be nice if it was just all oculus or all one company together

41:12.740 --> 41:18.420
making this device that could be used across everything but of course everybody wants their

41:18.420 --> 41:22.700
own things so they can patent it and sue each other and all that fun stuff I'm going to our

41:22.700 --> 41:28.980
chat room over at live dot vog network calm Akuma JP says in Japan no room to spare oh that's a good

41:28.980 --> 41:34.140
point and you know I'm not I'm not were there Japanese developers in that list of people for

41:34.140 --> 41:38.660
project Morpheus because now that I think about it you know again I don't follow oculus rift as

41:38.660 --> 41:43.980
closely as say Bobby or some of the other fans will but our Japanese developers it wasn't it

41:43.980 --> 41:48.220
wasn't necessarily developers it's more of like engines and middleware and that type of stuff so

41:48.220 --> 41:54.340
like you know unity unity or even like you know unreal and stuff that's used by different

41:54.340 --> 42:00.140
developers you know it could be you know from all all corners of the world so I don't think that's

42:00.140 --> 42:04.860
I'm sure that especially you know being that I think that would take off from Japan if the

42:04.860 --> 42:09.500
prices right because you know that is a big selling point not a lot of space VR could be

42:09.500 --> 42:13.340
pretty cool well I'm curious if there's going to be like maybe a cultural difference you know

42:13.340 --> 42:18.420
sometimes there are differences in the games that work in Japan versus that work here and vice versa

42:18.420 --> 42:23.940
I'm curious if VR is something that's going to be on both sides you know because Sony obviously has

42:23.940 --> 42:29.260
a big presence in Japan and America so I just I'm just kind of curious I mean I just I honestly

42:29.260 --> 42:34.580
don't know how well VR is received in Japan maybe maybe Akuma or some of our other folks know well

42:34.820 --> 42:40.700
Bobby Black Wolf's there saying in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com there are a lot of Asian

42:40.700 --> 42:46.860
developers working on the rift that's where most of the porn is from actually I'm and that's what

42:46.860 --> 42:51.380
I was gonna say I'm totally looking forward to all the you know all the not necessarily pornographic

42:51.380 --> 42:56.580
but all the perverted games coming from Japan who never use this there's a there's a very big plus

42:56.580 --> 43:02.020
in the oculus rift column I'm serious there's a very big plus in the oculus rift column you know

43:02.020 --> 43:07.900
why because everything on the PlayStation one's gonna be controlled whereas the oculus rift you

43:07.900 --> 43:12.740
can literally you know anybody that has a dev kit can make stuff for it and I'm not just you know

43:12.740 --> 43:19.220
I'm not just talking about porn although you know hey but you know it's it's the other stuff as well

43:19.220 --> 43:23.300
you're not gonna really be able to get that same homegrown stuff on the PlayStation 4 I mean yes I

43:23.300 --> 43:28.060
know that PlayStation embraces the indie developers and so forth but it's it's so much different like

43:28.060 --> 43:33.740
you know like Bobby Black Wolf can't put flappy vog on PlayStation 4 as easy as he put it out

43:33.740 --> 43:37.220
there on the internet you know I mean that's that's like the difference what I'm saying so

43:37.220 --> 43:46.980
anyway let's see Alan alchemy in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says VR porn is

43:46.980 --> 43:52.660
terrifying because you have a helmet on like you can be jerking it and have three people watching

43:52.660 --> 43:58.220
you with their cell phones out that is not a future I want to live in not only that but

43:58.220 --> 44:03.020
because you know like something like this device would be utilizing a secondary camera you could

44:03.020 --> 44:07.060
actually watch yourself jerking and have the VR camera on at the same time you'd have it like

44:07.060 --> 44:11.700
you know picture-in-picture almost if you're into that sort of thing I guess Wow so like

44:11.700 --> 44:17.380
would would cam sex have a whole new thing to it we're like I don't know I don't know it's

44:17.380 --> 44:27.100
POB to the max wouldn't be camp starvation too much like hamster so I don't know people are

44:27.100 --> 44:33.660
into hamsters let's see SSG 100 man our chair at live.vognetwork.com says the hardcore gamers

44:33.660 --> 44:38.220
only compile a margin of the overall profits towards gaming sales while the hardcore gamers

44:38.220 --> 44:43.180
might have interest in this it doesn't mean that the casual people will jump at this VR not just

44:43.180 --> 44:52.700
the Sony thing but also the rift well it depends on if they can get Wii Sports on it or all tongue

44:52.700 --> 44:59.220
and cheekiness aside if they can find that Wii Sports type of game that sells it I mean think

44:59.220 --> 45:07.980
about it Wii Sports sold the Wii that is how you push a peripheral I has there ever in history been

45:07.980 --> 45:12.940
a game that better sold a peripheral than Wii Sports I don't think there has Super Mario

45:12.940 --> 45:20.140
Brothers that wasn't that's not really a peripheral that's the whole damn system I don't

45:20.140 --> 45:27.480
well me I can't you might and I'm sure somebody's gonna say DDR but dude Wii Sports was million

45:27.480 --> 45:33.220
DDR zillion for the master system I don't know about that because well I mean the whole hair

45:33.220 --> 45:39.340
to Wii Sports come on not in that respect but zillion was pretty big for pushing master systems

45:39.340 --> 45:45.660
because they based the whole light gun off of the zillion gun maybe centipede and a trackball

45:45.660 --> 45:52.500
I'm reaching here but that that's a tempest that in the trackball that was a good point good point

45:52.500 --> 45:55.980
that's what I'm saying though I mean we could we could name all these different types of things

45:55.980 --> 46:01.020
here but that's what I'm saying is that oculus rift and project Morpheus need its Wii Sports

46:01.020 --> 46:06.660
that's what's gonna really sell those things all right let's move on with some other news here

46:06.660 --> 46:10.860
because it is only a three-hour show we could talk VR all night long I'm sure but I want to

46:10.860 --> 46:15.140
talk a little bit about some really big retail news that broke I think it was around the same

46:15.140 --> 46:19.460
time as game developers conference but this was not from game developers conference Walmart

46:19.460 --> 46:27.900
announced that starting March 26 you can trade in your used games at more than 3100 Walmart stores

46:27.900 --> 46:33.140
and in exchange you'll get a gift card that you can use at Walmart or Sam's Club all the exchange

46:33.140 --> 46:38.060
products will be sent for refurbishment and then will be made available for purchase in like new

46:38.060 --> 46:45.340
condition so Walmart don't fall for it don't fall for it you are you are already ready to hate on

46:45.340 --> 46:50.180
this well I fucking hate Walmart I don't really try not to give them my business they're a highly

46:50.180 --> 46:56.220
disreputable company uh-huh they're just just research their business practices before you

46:56.220 --> 47:01.100
give them it I like GameStop better than Walmart oh that's it okay but here okay so the hate boner

47:01.140 --> 47:06.220
is strong with this one but but your your hate boner for Walmart does that have anything to do

47:06.220 --> 47:09.220
with the whole use or do you think there's something about this used game practice that

47:09.220 --> 47:13.020
actually is going to be bad no I don't there's anything about the practice it's just that I think

47:13.020 --> 47:21.660
that in terms of social morality they're about the lowest on the pole you can get so I don't support

47:21.660 --> 47:26.780
them I would rather other people not support them I would rather just go to the mom-and-pop stores

47:26.780 --> 47:34.020
go to games go to GameStop before you go there and definitely go to Costco before you go to Sam's

47:34.020 --> 47:39.100
Club um just to give you an idea about how some things are going for Walmart right now the

47:39.100 --> 47:43.500
PlayStation 4 you can trade in for three hundred and seventy five dollars the Xbox one three

47:43.500 --> 47:49.460
hundred and ninety dollars the that's a pretty good trade-in value I'd have to say the Wii U

47:49.460 --> 47:57.780
deluxe $120 a 3g Vita is $95 that's actually kind of tempting because I don't really need the 3g in

47:57.780 --> 48:05.100
my Vita I've never used it Grand Theft Auto 5 do not give them money $27 I won't $27 72 cents

48:05.100 --> 48:11.700
Super Mario 3d World $38 those really aren't bad values but I mean honestly at the end of the day

48:11.700 --> 48:16.940
Dark Sakura what I prefer to do I cut out the middleman entirely well I mean I sell my games

48:16.980 --> 48:21.500
on eBay I mean so I guess yeah eBay is the middleman but I feel like it does still put

48:21.500 --> 48:25.720
me direct with the buyer and I get profit that way I would like to point out to Tiger Claw that

48:25.720 --> 48:31.700
people of Walmart is really a very not everyone who goes to Walmart looks like that that's just

48:31.700 --> 48:37.620
playing into stereotypes sure but the average person doesn't choose to educate themselves on

48:37.620 --> 48:44.260
the business practices of the place that they go to so I really really would rather that people

48:44.460 --> 48:49.660
actually put conscious effort into making the world a bit of a better place and not putting

48:49.660 --> 48:52.740
money into the hands of the people who are trying to fuck it over well here's the thing though Dark

48:52.740 --> 48:59.260
Sakura is that people you know the reality of the situation is Walmart is huge whether we like it or

48:59.260 --> 49:06.020
not they're huge they're a behemoth out there and I I could really see where this is gonna be a big

49:06.020 --> 49:10.640
thing I think it would have been a bigger thing five years ago I think Walmart's really late to

49:10.640 --> 49:16.720
the game in this regard but you know if if you had been able to take your games in and get that

49:16.720 --> 49:21.280
money that you could put towards groceries especially when the recession hit I think that

49:21.280 --> 49:27.000
would have been huge for Walmart yeah but I think that I would still be able to find other ways to

49:27.000 --> 49:31.600
get money there are there's a there's actually other places out there who will give you money

49:31.600 --> 49:36.560
for your games we have dimple sure and you probably get as much well dimples a local chain

49:36.560 --> 49:40.400
but a lot of places everybody's getting in on this Amazon you do their Amazon you can buy a lot of

49:40.880 --> 49:45.840
groceries out from Amazon in some cities you can do this for through I think Best Buy was to you

49:45.840 --> 49:50.120
but I think they ended it but there's there's definitely other places that you can go look you

49:50.120 --> 49:54.040
probably know a few more to that I'm not thinking of but what's your thoughts on Walmart taking the

49:54.040 --> 49:59.880
used games do you think it'll be successful for sure they'll do okay with it I don't know if it's

49:59.880 --> 50:05.080
gonna be just like it all depends on what what their trade-in values are and what they're

50:05.080 --> 50:10.160
reselling their used games at I mean that's really gonna decide how successful is because you know

50:10.440 --> 50:15.360
all they're gonna do is you know someone's gonna come up with a metric where okay game

50:15.360 --> 50:19.560
subs give me this Walmart's give me this here's where I'm gonna go you know especially if they're

50:19.560 --> 50:24.920
looking just to turn it around and purchase games with it now I don't know if Walmart does pre-orders

50:24.920 --> 50:32.000
on new games I mean I think that they do but I don't know no target does so I would think where

50:32.000 --> 50:35.960
one does the other probably does too but see that that's the thing is I mean I'm sure they don't

50:35.960 --> 50:40.640
really care because they're just looking at reselling that you know used stuff and making

50:40.640 --> 50:47.480
more of a profit margin from it so they could care less about you know the people that usually go to

50:47.480 --> 50:52.480
Walmart are looking for deals I mean and even the few time I don't really care to shop at Walmart

50:52.480 --> 50:58.760
either but the few times I have gone there because I purposely need something cheaply made are the

50:58.760 --> 51:04.400
only times I've gone to Walmart like I need a really shitty sheet for a theater production

51:04.400 --> 51:08.880
and I actually need it to be so shitty that it see through when you put a light behind it I think

51:08.880 --> 51:15.200
that was the last time I went to Walmart it was I actually needed a terrible sheet but it but anyway

51:15.200 --> 51:20.160
that the people that you you usually are going to Walmart looking for deals I would think are gonna

51:20.160 --> 51:24.760
really benefit from having to use games there because they're gonna be cheaper and people are

51:24.760 --> 51:29.160
gonna be like hey I don't care that it's a minute they'll throw in a dump in and people eat it up

51:29.160 --> 51:33.000
just like they eat up the cheap DVDs that they have yeah for real I don't know you can see that

51:33.000 --> 51:39.680
happening act-def in our chat room at live that vog network comm says Walmart does pre-orders so

51:39.680 --> 51:44.760
there you go I confirm that they do that do that I'm not surprised at all it doesn't seem like a

51:44.760 --> 51:50.360
particularly difficult thing for a company to do and you know kind of gets gets a little bit of

51:50.360 --> 51:55.280
their money and their customer loyalty from that all right anyway let's move on with some more news

51:55.280 --> 52:02.400
dark soccer with some interesting news coming up as soon as I can get my connection till you know

52:02.800 --> 52:08.400
to participate with the show live instead of participate five you know five hours from now

52:08.400 --> 52:14.160
so this is I know I'm actually not super sad about this but you remember I met somebody who

52:14.160 --> 52:20.800
was on my list of people to meet one year at e3 and it was this particular kind of rock star

52:20.800 --> 52:29.240
fella it was a Igarashi Koji who designed most of the latest to Castlevania games and was one

52:29.240 --> 52:36.880
of the developers for Symphony of the Night or as it was in Japan Nocturne in the Moonlight which

52:36.880 --> 52:44.920
is I think a better name basically he left Konami his last day was on March 15th and I'm gonna go

52:44.920 --> 52:48.800
ahead and read his quote because I actually like how he says it he said I've decided to break out

52:48.800 --> 52:53.440
on my own to have the freedom to make the kind of games I really want to make the same kind I think

52:53.440 --> 52:58.720
fans of my past games want as well leaving Konami was a big decision not one I took lightly I've

52:58.720 --> 53:03.480
spent my entire career there made many friends had a lot of great opportunities but I hope all

53:03.480 --> 53:08.360
the gamers and fans have supported me in the past will join me in being excited about what comes

53:08.360 --> 53:17.240
next wish me luck and I just got to meet him I you know we he put up with my really at the time

53:17.240 --> 53:27.640
awful Japanese and he's just a really neat guy I mean just you know to have met just once but I'm

53:28.040 --> 53:32.440
actually not sad to see him leaving Konami I think that we're gonna see I would like to be able to

53:32.440 --> 53:38.520
see his work with a lot more freedom because he's clearly very creative has fantastic ideas and I

53:38.520 --> 53:43.320
think it's gonna be good for him and for the gaming community in general to see what else he

53:43.320 --> 53:48.320
can come up with it's kind of interesting seeing that the reason one of the reasons I guess he left

53:48.320 --> 53:53.320
it was the whole fact that Konami is now kind of focusing more on social gaming and kind of the

53:53.320 --> 53:57.840
mobile scene you know basically he said you know the more hardcore the game the less suitable is

53:57.840 --> 54:02.640
for the casual market unfortunately I'm good at making core experiences so it was two years of

54:02.640 --> 54:08.320
making the game that leaned to hardcore for the social market so it was canceled then I'd try

54:08.320 --> 54:15.480
again and be canceled and again and be canceled so this this is a very interesting read of sorts

54:15.480 --> 54:19.320
on where Konami in general has been heading because you know I think we were even just a

54:19.320 --> 54:24.800
couple weeks sitting here going what is really Konami got in their in their cards right now

54:24.800 --> 54:29.160
besides Metal Gear these days on consoles the metal gear and Pro Evo that's they don't they

54:29.160 --> 54:33.720
don't really push out a lot of the franchises like they used to back in the day when we had a show

54:33.720 --> 54:38.760
that was half dedicated to one of their franchise a Konami franchise I mean that is not the same

54:38.760 --> 54:43.760
Konami that's there now but yeah they really crank out social stuff mobile phones and let's not forget

54:44.160 --> 54:51.800
and pachinko and really lucrative market for them actually Konami's in that business to listen

54:51.800 --> 54:56.160
let's not forget that you go to a casino and you'll see the Konami logo on a lot of the slot

54:56.160 --> 55:00.440
machines it's always cracked me up before the record where's my DDR slot machine I want to know

55:00.440 --> 55:05.880
I would also like to point out to people who call the Castlevania games on the handhelds as

55:05.880 --> 55:11.360
Metroidvania yeah she said when working on Symphony of the Night that his biggest influence was

55:11.360 --> 55:16.760
actually the Legend of Zelda that Metroid didn't factor into it oh interesting that it was the

55:16.760 --> 55:26.300
the exploration and finding and hidden things here and there that inspired part of the item

55:26.300 --> 55:33.720
system for Symphony of the Night and the subsequent games go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

55:33.720 --> 55:37.560
Tigerclaw says how long before the former Castlevania developer starts a Kickstarter

55:37.560 --> 55:43.520
for Castlevania like game who knows probably not long well I mean there was that story out there

55:43.520 --> 55:49.560
about that he would be happy to go work on a Metroid game and I think I think somebody posted

55:49.560 --> 55:53.940
that to my wall on Facebook and I responded with that picture of the cat that's all over

55:53.940 --> 55:58.160
tumblr that has that look on its face it just has the caption heavy breathing because that's exactly

55:58.160 --> 56:05.520
like yes yes how many times have I posted that on Facebook but I mean seriously like I would love

56:05.560 --> 56:11.600
for him to go work on a Metroid game I mean the newer Castlevania games were kind of crap I don't

56:11.600 --> 56:14.720
think he wasn't involved with the newer ones all right I don't think so because newer Castlevania

56:14.720 --> 56:19.720
games weren't they kind of forced them to be Castlevania as it was yeah exactly originally

56:19.720 --> 56:23.920
going to be a Castlevania game yeah so I mean I don't know like I don't know about how you

56:23.920 --> 56:27.960
guys feel but I kind of think like Castlevania peaked a long time I tried to make Castlevania

56:27.960 --> 56:32.720
several times with not quite Castlevania games you know with the Lords of Shadows and then there

56:32.720 --> 56:38.920
was that one that was God and I can't remember the name now but it was you're fighting robots

56:38.920 --> 56:47.800
and instead of blood it was oil or something and it it was nano breaker I think oh yes I do remember

56:47.800 --> 56:55.040
you know what I remember that game when it was cyber bot it was nano break yes I remember them

56:55.040 --> 56:59.400
yeah it was they were demoing that at e3 when you're a man I like cyber bots yeah I think I did it

56:59.400 --> 57:05.520
for a classic game once already 3ds ones are awesome I don't know dark Tetsuya telling me

57:05.520 --> 57:10.760
there is a beat mania slot machine I didn't know you said DDR yeah I did say DDR but I mean that's

57:10.760 --> 57:14.000
still pretty cool although I'm sure they don't make it anymore cuz my money's dead would you

57:14.000 --> 57:19.680
heard well that I think technically they're think technically they're still making you beat but

57:19.680 --> 57:25.120
whatever hey the money lives on on on iPads don't you know huh cyber bots is Capcom's number one

57:25.120 --> 57:32.040
game don't lie it's a quote it's a devil out quote from puzzle fighter that's oh that's right

57:32.040 --> 57:37.720
that's old-school everyone here's like what cyber bots reaching into the archive for quotes there

57:37.720 --> 57:43.520
all right he's not the only guy leaving lots of people are leaving different companies and for

57:43.520 --> 57:47.560
pretty much the same reasons kind of move on and do their own thing another person that's actually

57:47.680 --> 57:54.640
leaving Sony stig a moose and he's not working I guess at Sony Santa Monica he was kind of the

57:54.640 --> 58:02.880
creative director of God war 3 and I get guests basically you know they canceled what his new

58:02.880 --> 58:12.760
project and so you know he's basically left the company after being there for 11 years also along

58:12.760 --> 58:24.960
with him at sucker punch was see here Jamie Grissom er and basically he left after working on

58:24.960 --> 58:32.400
infamous second son but he's been there for quite a while as well a lot of these guys is kind of

58:32.400 --> 58:38.160
moving on and doing their own thing going back India yes this has to be related to the layoff

58:38.160 --> 58:42.720
news from a couple weeks ago what they laid off those people at Sony Santa Monica and this says

58:42.720 --> 58:48.120
that his project got canceled so he left that that has to be tied together and this one I'm

58:48.120 --> 58:54.760
kind of disappointed about but hopefully he's gonna be doing some great stuff on his own Tetsuya

58:54.760 --> 59:00.360
Mizuguchi has departed Q entertainment and of course you may recognize that name from such

59:00.360 --> 59:08.320
wonderful games including rez and rez like games like child of Eden basically saying that uh you

59:08.400 --> 59:15.400
know I guess he's moving on to his own well I thought that there was news like about a year

59:15.400 --> 59:21.560
ago that he was taking on another role anyway because I seem to remember morning the Mizuguchi

59:21.560 --> 59:25.640
was gonna be making another game anytime soon before and I thought there was something I mean

59:25.640 --> 59:29.400
I don't think the news was that he had left the company but that he was taking some type of like

59:29.400 --> 59:34.600
other role within it so I mean and they're even kind of confused on that sucks though cuz I love

59:34.600 --> 59:37.320
his work I guess there's like some anonymous sources they're saying that you know they're

59:37.320 --> 59:41.600
kind of confused when he may have left that he's been keeping a secret that he's been gone and he

59:41.600 --> 59:48.080
may have actually departed was it last year sometime so I don't know what the hell's Q

59:48.080 --> 59:54.160
doing then that's interest no idea I haven't really seen anything developing so maybe there's

59:54.160 --> 59:57.320
got they've got something in secret they're working on no big no where he would be pretty

59:57.320 --> 01:00:04.120
awesome huh harmonics yeah I don't know in East meets West West kind of thing could be interesting

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.360
badass I kind of I think with like the visual styles that he's got with his games and stuff

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.040
that fit right in with you know was it uh their brand new shooter that they've got you know there

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.000
is a reality though that maybe he doesn't want to do video games anymore like the guy who did

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.800
Katamari Damacy right ended up making like kids rides yeah he came back and started making like

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.920
smaller video I mean he keeps coming back and making little videos here and there and he'll

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.480
come back hopefully we haven't seen the last of music and you caught a Mario fucking awesome

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.720
that's just that's a series that's been kind of quiet for a little while huh it's cuz he drove

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.960
it into the ground it's like hey it's a new game Oh psych it's just still the old levels again it's

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.320
another new ads kids old levels that it that is a series I'd like to see kind of come but that

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.040
that's something they could put on project Morpheus because that will make people sick

01:00:52.040 --> 01:01:03.240
whatsoever can you imagine Katamari Damacy in VR it would make for an interesting like survival

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:10.680
mode where you're running away from the giant Katamari Akuma JP with a clarification on now

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.720
where Tetsuya Mizuguchi is gone Akuma JP says he was going to teach in a university and Q is doing

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.480
social games so I mean this is really like a running theme is I mean maybe not so much the

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:28.960
Sony one but we're seeing that companies shifts toward social games is driving the old guard and

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:35.400
some of these these faces that really developed the classic games we love out well they're taking

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.920
the safe route because it's it's a you know social gaming is where they're making a lot of money so

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.800
you can't fault them for wanting to you know keep their company profitable but at the same time it's

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.400
like yeah it does kind of suck that these guys are going but you know if the you know these

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.800
creative guys that are you know known for these fantastic games they're not necessarily needed

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.640
for a lot of these social games anymore because I mean you don't have to be too entirely creative

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:06.600
to come up with something that's gonna sell okay on you know mobile devices I could see them you

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.400
know going on to form their own you know spinning off to form their own companies and a lot of these

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.880
guys do that and you see a lot of stuff being kick-started or you know that's why there's a

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.140
whole indie resurgence again so I I don't know it's I'm hopeful that he'll make something cool

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.000
lots of very passionate comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.600
it is kind of sad that both Capcom and Konami are both essentially going to disappear for the mobile

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.080
market Jason with a little bit of a rant here saying people make social games with the same

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.680
boring-ass formula if there's one thing Nintendo got right it's the incredibly light use of

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.320
effective social elements Nintendo Network Super Mario 3d world low Nintendo is doing

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:54.120
non real-time social better than anyone else hmm dark Tetsuya supports that comment that she actually

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:03.800
do agree I don't know I do and I don't like I I don't I don't know like I do still enjoy those

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:10.080
elements that Nintendo puts in their games but yet I still yearn for like Nintendo to really push

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:16.640
that envelope further with online like where is my true online experience I don't even think like

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.560
the stuff that they have implemented in some of these games and you know with the whole you know

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.560
hey I could leave a comment here in this part of the game stuff that they do on the Wii U I don't

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.040
think that's if you didn't have that like you'd really miss it I would think I just think it's

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.600
kind of like oh that's gonna neat but it doesn't really add that much it doesn't say like wow I

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.220
need to get this version of the game because it has this feature in it that's never crossing

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.920
anyone's mind it just kind of something that I do that's like see you look hey we have internet

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:49.360
we understand social media we're hip we're cool you know I think the coolest thing that Mario

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.640
does is when it gets the ghosts in the levels that came from you know other people running it

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.920
that I think I think that's the coolest use of the social media and that's the kind of stuff

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.520
I would like to see like more of I think that's that's really cool that's not even social media

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.840
that's like shit they were doing from the DS like where you would you know get ghost data from

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.200
people and stuff I just don't it's not that new it's cool I like that they have that but it's I

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.600
wouldn't even go as far as saying it's like social media it's just you're sharing ghost data I mean

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:26.520
let's let let's not overly complicate things all right let's move on with some more news and that

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.120
has to do with the Xbox one which we haven't talked a whole lot about tonight but I know a

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.000
lot of people have been picking up Xbox ones because like there was a big sale this week on

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.320
that new Titanfall bundle right like I think Walmart marked it on 50 bucks and then Best Buy

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:45.000
was price matching it so a lot of people picking up an Xbox one right now and a lot more people

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.440
gonna be picking them up in September because the Xbox one will come to 26 more markets in September

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:59.400
eight of those were part of the original launch lineup that includes places like Denmark Russia

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.880
Sweden Switzerland they were cut from the original launch plans but now they will be launching there

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.600
in September one of the other big places of note where the game will be launching in September will

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:17.960
be Japan so finally Japan gets its Xbox one but the question is who cares will they care yeah

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.440
Akuma do you think other people will care it's all about the games right well it could I mean

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.440
let's see what happens at e3 because you know if you think about it okay if the system is coming

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:35.120
out in Japan in September this is the opportunity this e3 for Microsoft to get up on stage and say

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:41.160
hey XYZ Japanese developer who has been secretly working on an Xbox one exclusive this whole time

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.760
such as they weren't getting those some good support for the Xbox before for a lot of the

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.360
shooters so I wonder if that would be enough to you know if they start getting more local development

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.640
for like just those bullet hell games would that get people to buy to hell more RPGs I have a

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:05.360
tinfoil hat theory Akuma JP says don't care I have a tinfoil hat yeah well what's missed Walker

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:11.360
doing right now because we know remember they were big stuck in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.920
no but they remember they they were a big start of the push for exclusives on the Xbox 360 when

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:24.240
they have Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey which you know but the problem is again Lost Odyssey wasn't

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.520
exactly a huge sales behemoth which is criminal because that game is fucking amazing I thought

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:34.960
that Blue Dragon was really fun and on the Wii I know they did last story was on the Wii right

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.960
and I know they've done some DS games in between there but what are what's like their big project

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:45.040
they're doing right now hmm I don't see them working on something for the Wii U maybe maybe

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:51.480
maybe I don't know maybe yet did the last story sell better than Lost Odyssey did now miss Walker

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.680
didn't do Dragon Quest right there were no no that's I get confused because it's the same art

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:05.400
square enix well yeah but I mean think of the out source development no and well we never got

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.920
the Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest X is the MMO we never got that anyway which is weird I don't

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.920
think that would do that well over here I it's just it's one of those things is you know they

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.360
don't have a lot of people that have just you know you're cornering the Wii U market then you

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.560
have you know people that are gonna play an MMO on this thing it's just I don't know that it's

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:31.320
too risky to bring it over here Akuma JP says missed Walker is in social games too that's a

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:37.800
sad laugh um Akuma JP also says yeah like like Dart Sakura had quoted earlier they don't care

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.800
people who want to play Titanfall will buy that's kind of what's happening over here like five

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:49.560
people well I don't know I think it's more magic well me actually in Japan probably not a lot but

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.720
I should have to say after seeing Titanfall in action yeah III think it would be it would

01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.520
actually be a decent selling factor it actually is pretty good yeah on Xbox I mean I mean not

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.680
Xbox but I saw the PC one yeah and it was it was pretty good but see that's the thing it's like if

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.760
they really want to play Titanfall I think they just pick it up on PC why wait you know almost

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:18.480
six months yeah all right um let's anyway lots and lots of regions that the Xbox will be coming to

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:27.520
other big places Argentina India Israel Korea Saudi Arabia Singapore South Africa those are

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.720
just some of the countries a lot lots and lots of places getting the Xbox one a little later this

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:38.480
year so please look forward to it to register participation for this week's episode of Orange

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.600
Laundry radio at vog network comm use the passphrase belt well how about something that has

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:50.040
nothing to do with actual gaming systems but does affect gaming systems let's hear it well Netflix

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.920
we've been talking about the whole deal with the net neutrality popping up and since the the ruling

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.680
past and just on top of that there were the other situations where we're seeing Netflix making deals

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.080
with Comcast and you know other companies trying to get a bandwidth deals well now Netflix is sort

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:19.200
of turning it over and their CEO Reed Hastings put on a blog post this past Thursday that that

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:26.280
uh basically they're just he's just completely they said that the original definition of net

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:34.800
neutrality isn't fitting and it needs to be changed to to basically describe better the

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.400
activities around customer activities and what's going to you know demand what's going to use more

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.560
services can use less this quote says without strong net neutrality companies like Comcast can

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.720
make these demands driving up cost and prices for everyone else which is basically what we've been

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.600
saying anyway yet they've gone and make that deal so is this you know a case of a little hypocrisy

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.840
or is it that this is something that was already in the works is it I just don't understand why

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.240
they would just switch over like that but it I mean but it's a correct statement we know we see

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:17.000
it's happening already and there's also a Comcast executive though who was saying that the Netflix

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.600
CEO was wrong this is the open internet rules never were designed to deal with peering and

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.920
internet connection providers like Netflix have always paid for their connection so we've got a

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:33.320
little bit of an argument here well obviously there's concern about net neutrality because

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.880
it's in some ways it's kind of a ticking time bomb when it comes to gaming specifically because you

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.960
know we don't know what might happen where you know I think what's ultimately gonna happen is

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.680
that you're gonna see that these these providers start to put their data caps out there and they

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.920
have the different plans and they're gonna try to sell these cheaper plans that are very stringent

01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:00.280
on the data caps but yet there will be certain services that will not count towards the data cap

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.440
which I think already happens with Comcast and they're like Xfinity movies and things like that

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.360
I don't think count towards whatever I don't even know if they're enforcing data caps right now but

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:15.240
you know they had that thing I and but it's just a matter of time before we see will Xbox live count

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:21.320
towards that will PlayStation Network count towards that will something like on live or

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.120
one of those streaming gaming solutions will they try to be the ones that you know I get the free

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:33.160
pass on the bandwidth I don't know but I I just don't think like Comcast can be so bold as to

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.000
start telling these tiered internet things because it's gonna be a huge revolt it's not like customers

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.600
don't have the choice to go other places yes they may have not have other cable providers in your

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:49.160
area but shit I know people that would go back to DSL rather than put up with this tiered internet

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:54.280
bullshit well also I'd like to read what the pagans you just said and the theory behind the deal is

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.520
good marketing because of the upcoming merger they want sure they can play nice at least that's what

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:08.160
I heard on NPR and why did Alan say but when doesn't he say but he doesn't want the internet

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:16.720
to regulate the pictures of butts going on out there I think is the problem but anyway yeah I

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:23.600
think I think that's a good theory that Comcast is making nice nice with Netflix because that could

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.640
have been a thorn in their side with the merger coming up and you know they're gonna have to

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:37.080
show that it's not antitrust basically that they control too much so anyway also hmm I agree with

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:44.080
butts who doesn't agree with butts all right well coming soon to a gaming store near you let's see

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:52.040
if there's some video games that may feature butts Loki anything in the u.s. sorry no butts this time

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:59.080
cut the rope triple treat coming out on 3ds the witch in the hundred night on PlayStation 3

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:06.760
although the alternate artwork for that does feature I think her but Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:14.920
I think there's a butter to in that on PC Dynasty Warriors 8 extreme legends on PlayStation 3 and

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:22.280
extreme legends complete edition on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 deception for blood ties

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:31.960
on PlayStation 3 and on the Vita Cabela's big-game hunt her pro hunts on ps3 Xbox 360 and Wii U and

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:41.360
that is Alan alchemy by the way in our chat room clarifying his comment saying I said butts because

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.960
Comcast which actually is a perfectly valid explanation now that you say that Jamie do

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.440
you accept that explanation that's all the time well that's a game because before the show I said

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.520
that you liked big butts and you cannot lie you other brothers can't deny all right going to Japan

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.760
and talking about some of the releases over there hey on the PlayStation 3 biohazard 6 premium

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:50.800

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.040
realness which you all should check out if you haven't been listening to it it's a really fun

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.120
show but they've been talking a lot about smite it's it's kind of like a League of Legends style

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.120
game I know it does like more like you can do like first-person points of view or not not for

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.840
but like more like World of Warcraft looking because you know how League of Legends is kind

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.840
of like a like a top-down sort of thing but like I guess smites a little more like World of

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.760
Warcraft leading so I it's kind of one of those style games I would also like to point out for

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.520
people next month that goat simulator comes out next month and everyone needs this game I'm going

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.920
to be getting goat simulator the heat Loki's been talking sorry I'm great give it up for the goats

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.880
that it that is when I a I convinced my sister she doesn't even have steam or anything I'm like

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.560
dude you need to get that's coming out next and you know in two weeks and she's like okay well

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:44.640
we need to hook up Sean's computer and you know give it up for the goat see it looks great but

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.520
here's the best here's the but what here's the best part but yes the best part about goat

01:18:50.520 --> 01:19:00.840
simulator besides the fact goat emulator beside the fact that it looks crazy is steam they're

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.240
gonna have the whole steam or workshop support so you're gonna be able to make your own shit

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.320
if you really want to I don't know if it would probably get voted off there because it's

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:16.200
inappropriate you could make your own goat say yeah I have this weird feeling that goat simulators

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:22.160
like the new minecraft like wait like I kind of think I it just I don't call it a hunch kind of

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.840
think goat simulators the new minecraft reginator says what about goat simulator to goat stimulator

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:34.680
oh I saw there like sirs you are a damn pervy I've been in the corner I've been following the

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.960
guys that you know they make the game and just like just basically trolling everywhere to try

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.200
to find you know some sort of new footage of the game and the best I could do with someone posted

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:49.800
a vine video that they had of playing goat simulator at GDC that cliffy B had that I don't

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.880
remember but it was something yeah where he had the tongue stuck to the back of the car and he

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:59.360
was being drunk around in circles like oh god I need this game now it's so amazing it does look

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.400
like a game that you you would have made it really did it's like you love you guys you guys know

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.920
Loki loves his sandbox games come on grand theft auto 5 he never shuts up about it Saints Row 4

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:14.500
he never shuts up about it he loves the sandbox game what is goat simulator it's just I just

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:22.280
stewed in parts with goats and it's not ridiculous over the top which is the other but I see you

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.960
know I would get this too because you know what my one of my favorite animals and all the entire

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:32.000
universe is goats because I love their eyes and goats are the best they're the most adorable

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.840
things ever and like the goats that are at fairy tale land here in Sacramento for when I have to

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.640
go with Becky and she takes Julian and I just hang out with goats say you love the goats say you do

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:50.960
I love cats yeah okay how's that you happy you ever have to do a new intro you know what you

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:57.400
guys can bite me and you're gonna say that you guys are awful okay here I am trying to support

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:06.080
independent gaming and you guys are being you know what that indie game yeah I know plenty of what's

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.360
pick that indie game is probably the first one in a long time where all three of us said pre-ordered

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:26.160
I don't know I think the game is pretty mad I like big goats and I cannot lie oh come on were

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:35.880
you raised in a barn no all right um that's it for the UK dates yes I'm seriously hoping that

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.160
they put goat boy in that that game somehow all right Loki why don't you reach on in and pull

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:51.280
out another story for us okay so um there was I guess Siliconera had asked Nintendo about you

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.200
know unity coming possibly to the 3ds because you know it's supported on the Wii U and hell that's

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.800
how a lot of those you know indie games are on the Wii U's because people are building them in

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:09.240
unity and porting them over using the unity export stuff and of course the generic answer that they

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.840
got I don't even know this is exactly news is we're definitely looking at it so there you go

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:22.480
they're definitely looking at something so I'm definitely looking at it yeah my eyes are in that

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:33.440
general direction what you're you have you already forgotten about the goats have not but I I heard

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.600
aren't they aren't there supposed to be like 50 games or something using this that are coming to

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.320
we use soon I thought there's a lot of games that are using it I'm not sure on the exact number but

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.320
I can imagine like 50 games that sounds about right makes everybody I mean a lot of people are

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.840
using unity especially because the Wii U doesn't really support a ton of different engines that

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:59.560
you know can be multi-platform so I can see it's one of the few that you know people are developing

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:04.120
games for that's easy to port to other systems how they added support for the Vita and you know

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:12.440
PlayStation 3 for it supports most of the consoles out there right now all right well as SSG 100 Matt

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:18.440
in our chat room says moving on to the next topic well apparently your boyfriend thinks we need Jesus

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:26.640
why don't you tell him a thing or two let me tell you a thing all right moving on let me tell you

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.320
about Unreal Engine 4 Unreal Engine 4 this is some other big news that came out of game developers

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.840
conference Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be out it's it's gonna be basically available to plenty more

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.320
people it's it's open to the public essentially for the low low cost of $19 a month but there is

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.960
a catch if you are going to profit off the game it will involve a royalty agreement asking for

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.880
5% in gross sales so you know but I mean you can do a lot with Unreal Engine so it might be worth

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.840
it to some people so yeah Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be available to the public it's a subscription

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:03.800
based service there this is the same thing that triple-a game developers have been using for lots

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:08.200
and lots of money but yeah it's big big news coming out of game developers conference direct

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:13.440
out of direct out of the mouth of Tim Sweeney who is the epic games founder so this is great because

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:20.220
you know assuming that developers are willing to take the you know 5% agreement a lot of indie

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:25.920
games can really focus on you know making that game and you know the engine will do a lot of

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:32.120
hopefully the legwork for them we see a lot a lot of games out there that use Unreal Engine 3 as it

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:38.360
is you know things like forget doesn't Final Fantasy 13 run on Unreal some of it like like

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.200
there's a lot of weird games out there you wouldn't think run on this engine that do I know the last

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.920
remnant ran on yeah real yeah there's just a lot of games out there that run on it like the Mortal

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:54.800
Kombat games do right pretty sure they do so you know this could be a great thing for Loki this

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.000
sounds like the type of thing where you might be raising an eyebrow going is this another thing I

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.560
should play with no I don't want to learn something else you don't want to learn something else ones

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:10.480
enough for you yeah maybe later fair enough all right well before we get to our break here we're

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.680
gonna go back to a classic time in gaming it's a classic time when there was no engine there was no

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.200
do-it-yourself you end up you want to make a video game you learned assembly language we've

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.920
bought a very expensive you had you had a Texas Instruments computer and programmed a little

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.960
bleeping ball that's right dark soccer is gonna take us to the classic game of the week archive

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:38.080
dark soccer what is a video game that you think the kids out there should be playing this week

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.960
speaking of things that come on he's fucking run into the ground nothing is as great as the

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:49.040
original Frogger what a what a timely choice unintentionally and I will tell you about Frogger

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.960
and my history with this game before I go further into it and to be clear this is the original

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:03.920
arcade game not the pot not the shit not the dumps that Konami took on the franchise so anyway I

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:14.520
imagine me around eight years old on roller skates playing Frogger it's damn hard to play Frogger on

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.800
roller skates it's hard to play almost any arcade game on roller skates and I did play a stand-up

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:25.680
pole position on roller skates as well I played the exact same Frogger machine at Babalu skating

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:33.040
rink in Dothan Alabama every summer for probably the next 11 years after that so and it still

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.400
worked it had some burnin it was old but damn machine still worked and now it's gone and I

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:44.320
mourn that particular Frogger but that was my Frogger anyway Frogger is a game we play as a

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:51.200
stupid frog and you were trying to get across the street and then across the pond into your little

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.200
froggy hole and sometimes crocodiles might try to eat you which I've never seen a crocodile eat a

01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:02.960
frog but I have seen it grab a man by its leg this happened for now I've seen this having him

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:11.400
because I'm from the swamp anyway a Frogger came out in 1981 it was developed by Konami and licensed

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:18.200
by Sega and Gremlin at the time so basically you just have to navigate traffic you know keep from

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:24.320
getting run over by the damn front by the trucks and apparently a Formula One cars go on the street

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:33.880
in whatever town this is and all kinds of things it is you know one of the very classics of games

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:42.800
it also was one of the first games that used more than one CPU is choose 80 processors it is

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:51.920
basically still super popular and shush don't judge me for saying froggy hole okay I'm not the

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.600
one having an obsession with froggy don't get distracted by chat especially when they're being

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:05.560
perverts up so anyway by 2005 Frogger sold more than 20 million copies worldwide including 5

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:12.760
million in the u.s. so yeah you use a joystick you you know have to navigate the froggy around you can

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:18.680
send them up and the different types of vehicles that you can be smushed flat by our cars trucks

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:27.320
buses dune buggies bulldozers vans taxis bicyclists motors and or motorcycles that will just cut

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.520
through traffic and then in the next half you have crocodiles and turtles the turtles can sink

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.160
into the ground the crocodiles can eat you but you can land on their backs you can ride their ass the

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:44.320
entire way if you want and then you land in your frog home sorry not frog hole and the levels are

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.800
timed so different things will kill you make turning you into a little skull and crossbones

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:58.400
which the last time I saw a frog a frog skull it was when I was cutting into it when I was in ninth

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:06.960
grade in biology class so at any rate you could be hit by a car you could jump into the water run

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:14.280
into snakes otters or into crocodiles jaws you can jump into a home invaded by a crocodile you

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.080
can stay on a diving turtle that is submerged to ride a log crocodile turtle off the screen

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.800
jump onto a log a home already occupied by a frog jump into the side of a home or in the bush and

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:32.880
running out of time before getting your froggy home as far as other versions there have been

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:39.360
many others there have been clones as people in chat room are mentioning right now Sierra had the

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.080
magnetic media rights as far as cartridge versions Parker medic media as in discs Oh

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:55.680
okay Parker brothers licensed it from Sega for cartridges we've seen copies on the TRS 80 the

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:02.240
Sinclair 1000 and Sinclair 2068 sorry it has just clicked for me after all these years why

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.640
Frogger two three deep which was the one I loved on Commodore 64 was only ever on cartridge because

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:13.960
it was a Parker brothers game I just had an aha moment Thank You dark soccer I feel welcome

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:20.960
lightened we had Atari 2600 versions the multiple releases and there was a cassette for the

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:27.040
supercharger and Tommy there was a Tomy Tudor version that was also licensed from Konami

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:33.000
themselves but not it's not clear if it's been developed by Konami Parker brothers also did the

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000
releases for 2600 and television Atari 5200 which I have the clique of vision which I have

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:46.040
Atari 8-bit computers the vic-20 and Commodore 64 as you mentioned Rob Sierra had the Commodore

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:52.520
64 disk versions which is why there were two versions on the Commodore 64 and there's Apple

01:30:52.520 --> 01:31:00.400
to those the original 128 came Macintosh the IBM PC the Atari 2600 supercharger and then the versions

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:08.680
for the TRS 80 color computer and Sinclair did had a version developed by corn soft in the UK

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:16.400
about 10 million was spent on advertising for Frogger and it was advertised along with the

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:23.360
Empire Strikes Back there's your Star Wars thing Coleco also had a mini arcade tabletop version

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:29.760
that was released also along with Pac-Man Galaxian and Donkey Kong I have one of those taken apart

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:38.120
awesome now there were clones of it including froggy for the ZX spectrum hopper by anchor

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:45.080
anchor and soft for the BBC micro and the acorn electron there was another Frogger for the BBC

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:51.800
micro ZX spectrum there was Frogger for sharp MZ 700 in the UK and a version of done for the new

01:31:51.800 --> 01:32:00.800
brand by the name of elite the Atari 2600 also had a game named freeway that its working title

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:07.720
was bloody human freeway awesome so I mean like I said there's just been like a bunch of different

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:14.840
versions I mean we have them by Hasbro we have them you know rereleases for PlayStation we have

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:21.120
there was a prototype based off a Frogger for the Sega Game Gear that was never released but

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:27.120
apparently I think there are leaks of the ROM set out there was a Porta Frogger for Xbox Live

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:34.760
Arcade and that was developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Konami so then you were right

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.760
the sequel to Frogger was Frogger 2 3 deep in 1984 there was another Frogger in 1997 Frogger

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.480
2 swap is revenge in 2000 and then a bunch of shit that Konami took on the franchise well

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:52.080
well that first Konami won the Frogger in 97 that was a huge game that was a huge that was on the

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.800
original PlayStation that was a huge game it was very different you know because it had the larger

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:03.560
kind of worlds you know that game I thought was incredibly boring I I owned it actually I didn't

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:09.280
I didn't mind it I thought it was cool well how about some pop culture references this time Frogger

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:18.600
had an animated series as part of the Saturday Supercade the CBS did it was included with it

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:24.680
was Frogger pitfall Harry and then their segments were replaced by kangaroo and space ace and there

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:31.800
was a segment on remember that show VR troopers they were beating a frog monster called amphibidor

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:37.720
based off of Frogger and it's been mentioned in that horrid horde show Seinfeld which I still

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:46.240
do not like to show MTV movie that was a really funny episode though okay well basically there

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:51.880
was a reference to a bunch of different early games in that one and Frogger was in wreck-it Ralph

01:33:51.880 --> 01:34:00.160
hanging around a game central station and in 1982 and that's why I'm saying stay tuned to the very

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.240
end of the show tonight Buckner and Garcia did a song called froggies lament that was on the

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:12.040
Pac-Man fever soundtrack and as I recall for single wasn't it the b-side I don't know bad

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:19.360
religion did a song called Frogger where he says that Los Angeles is trying to play Frogger with

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:30.720
his life yeah there's basically quite a number of different references but the best of them ever in

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:37.080
2006 there's a group in Austin Texas that modified a Roomba dressed as a Frogger to do a real-life

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.400
version of the game that used a bitch a Bluetooth controller the Roomba was able to get across the

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:49.600
street 10 times 40 lanes and survived for 15 minutes before it was quote killed by an SUV a

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:57.440
game over you know and actually Frogger has been a nickname for disease as well I don't know if I

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:07.000
was it was a name given to the jumping gene for a particular family fruit fly okay then there you

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.480
go is that it there's all the highest by the way the highest Frogger score by Michael Smith

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.640
of Springfield Virginia and the world record was nine hundred and seventy thousand four hundred and

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:25.120
forty points and he beat Pat Lafayette on December 26 on 2099 and I'm guessing that's a some sort of

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:31.720
yeah it's a Twin Galaxies thing so whatever all right what evs there Frogger there it is your

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:38.520
konami shit there it is your classic game of the week Frogger which really is a real real classic

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.400
if you think about it yeah I mean all those references alone no Frogger will ever be as

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:50.280
awesome as me on my roller skates as a seven-year-old playing at Babalu skating rink in Dothan Alabama

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:59.640
well fair enough all right here then Rob uh-huh it was long and bored straight my hair when I

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:07.080
was seven went to my ass you will never see it be that long ever all right we're gonna take a break

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.920
Jamie's doctor I'm just looking at the related videos by the way to the Frogger video and

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:16.080
somebody recreated it of course in Grand Theft Auto Frogger of course they did that's hilarious

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:19.920

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.520
getting back at you for locking her in the bathroom for an hour during the move it was

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.000
one hour and it was for her own good and safety we didn't want her to run away hey not that she

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.800
would ever go outside but she would just she would have freaked out more outside all right

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.080
unfortunately this is not a podcast dedicated to cats although I don't know maybe I should

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.800
start a fourth podcast about cats but I could totally do a podcast about cats I'm gonna just

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.720
gonna call it old cat lady it'd be fun you never know I'm surprised they don't they probably do

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.960
have one called pod cats there's got to be there's got to be a show called pod cats if there's not

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.760
patent-ending all right let's uh let's do some rapid-fire news it's a video game podcast let's

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.800
talk about what's going on in games real quick Loki so looking forward to playing Titanfall

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.680
and 360 was supposed to be coming out this week but then at the last minute they're like hey it's

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:38.160
not ready and so it's now coming out on April 8th in North America and April 11th in Europe

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:44.280
and they said no we'll we see a few things that can be made even better and so we're giving

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:51.160
blue point a little bit more time to deliver an epic Titanfall experience for the 360 according

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:59.920
to the press release more like it's not done yet and that they they're working on epic day

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:07.880
one patch but you know that's neither here and there but yeah hopefully it's an awesome game

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:15.680
PlayStation 4 they announced that they're also offering in these some new development tools

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:21.840
to help with publishing games on their console including with that you know the ability to export

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:30.160
to PlayStation 4 on game maker studio as well as mono game which is I guess free to license

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:36.080
Sony computer entertainment developers and also of course you know unity does support PlayStation

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:44.280
3 and PlayStation 4 and I guess our PlayStation 3 and Vita and the PlayStation 4 version of the

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:52.240
export is coming for I guess some early access people in April and so that would be pretty cool

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.360
also they're authoring tools framework I guess this free open source available to download and

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.000
they use that you know in their first party games like you know last of us and beyond two souls and

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:14.760
that kind of stuff so pretty cool and then also they're going to be doing some more updates to the

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:21.240
PlayStation 4 firmware that's gonna allow you to do some game capture without HDCP restrictions

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:28.000
because right now you're kind of limited how you can capture on you know the PlayStation 4 but with

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.640
that you're gonna be able to I guess you know export clips and that kind of stuff you know you

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:41.840
can record and share longer clips of gameplay sessions and you know beyond I don't know if you

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:48.440
can yeah upping the resolution on ustream and twitch streams to 720p which is gonna be coming

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.800
in a later update so that's kind of cool that they're doing that and also the ability to save

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:59.040
videos and screenshots to a USB Drive so you know you want to edit them off your PlayStation 4 you

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:06.120
can do that as well instead of having to just export and stuff that's awesome all right well

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:11.400
moving on to some other news disregarding Mega Man Legends 3 you know it broke many hearts that

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:17.960
this game did not end up happening including the Mega Man creator KJ Inafune still wants Mega Man

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:23.400
Legends 3 to happen he said recently that if somebody asked even right now what's the game

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:28.520
you want to create most it's still Legends 3 I put so much effort into that game so much passion

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:34.040
into that game but it didn't happen it's always a regret in my mind even now we all know that it's

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.840
not gonna happen though as long as Capcom holds the IP but if they asked me to make the game I

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:45.040
could still gather most of the original team even right now so hey I'd be happy to see a mighty

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:53.400
number 9 legends if you know what I mean that by the way in comments to a US gamer moving on I

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.160
mentioned during the Japanese release dates that a new Nintendo Wii U was coming well it's just a

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:02.920
different type of bundle here what's happening is that the Wii U premium pack in Japan is being

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:09.880
replaced with a Wii Sports Club bundle hmm so yes a Wii Sports Club bundle is going on sale in Japan

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:17.280
starting on March 27th it will be a 32 gig Wii U premium console with a gamepad and then we use

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:22.680
our excuse me Wii Sports Club passes for events like bowling golf and tennis from Wii U Sports

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.360
Club because remember we use sports clubs that whole weird like free-to-play thing where you can

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:33.200
like demo it for 24 hours or you can buy one game or you can buy yeah so it comes with passes for

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:38.520
some of the games there and of course a Wiimote controller and a wrist strap all for the low low

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:44.640
price of 30,000 yen as you say they include a Wii remote with that that's just bullshit I know of

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.000
course there's a there's a Wii remote there so you can actually play the game and lastly also about

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:59.240
Nintendo a trademark for QOL in Japan for a number of products QOL quality of life and the trademarks

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.480
are covering things including portable gaming devices standalone gaming devices merchandise

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:10.000
beauty products so very interesting nobody knows though what exactly this could be about although

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.280
some people think it could be some type of new fitness initiative well yeah I remember they were

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.840
talking about that they wanted to kind of go in that direction in which I still don't I mean I

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:27.840
cool but once again I don't think this is gonna I don't know where they're going well I ranted a

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:33.160
few weeks ago about how Nintendo should have had the Fitbit craze and they lost it and maybe this

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.640
is their chance to try and still capture that although I kind of thought we you or we fit you

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.400
was supposed to kind of have that whole thing in it so I don't know what else they're enhancing to

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:49.080
the fitness thing but we'll see I just don't I don't get it right now I mean it to me this is

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:55.520
almost like how I didn't get the Wii vitality sensor and I still don't get that and it's cool

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.760
the app they want to you know do something where you can exercise and they can do all that sort of

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.880
tracking stuff but the problem is there's already stuff out there that does that and probably does

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.360
it better and just because it has my has a me in it doesn't mean I'm gonna fucking buy it or I'm

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.640
gonna buy a system for it so I'm I just wait and see what they're gonna do with this we'll see

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:23.080
dark soccer what do you have for us we have some stuff basically we've got going on and this is

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:29.120
kind of sad but all of the DLC for guitar hero DJ hero and band hero is going to be going away

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:38.320
as of March 31st so yeah I get it while the getting's good and guitar hero on iOS is going

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:45.000
to be discounted through the end of the month on the App Store in other news we have a new

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:55.160
character that has been revealed for ultra Street Fighter 4 and that's Decapra Decapra Decapra who's

01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:01.360
one of bison's dolls or I should say Vega for the Japanese version she's the arch villain of the

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:09.960
doll guard and she is a clone of Cammy also and this one was really sad and Dan and I actually

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.560
talked about this because part of what put him in the hospital for congestive heart failure were

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:23.160
energy drinks and a Norwegian team teen I'm sorry basically was part of a he was 14 year old kid

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:30.880
named Henrik who was at his cafeteria school doing a Call of Duty land party that lasted 16

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:36.800
hours he said this is the quote I was playing Call of Duty then everything went dark and I passed

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:45.920
out he was sent to a hospital in Lillehammer who basically he was in a coma for several days his

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:51.560
kidney started to fail other organs started to fail and it was because he had been drinking

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:59.320
energy drinks the entire time the rest of the rest of his health had been pretty okay all up until

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:07.400
that point but it was the combination of lack of sleep focused attention and just drinking

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.560
consistent energy drinks for the period of 16 hours he drank four liters of energy drinks that's

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:18.880
a little excessive that's even you wouldn't drink that much that's just stupid that is also 14 which

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.280
goes along with you know stupid and that that's a good way to make your heart explode yeah but but

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:31.160
and the reason I'm saying the soup is more like an ignorant thing you think the human brains under

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.880
like 25 years old are not programmed to think about long-term effects they're programmed to

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:41.800
think about immediate reward so that is I need to stay awake let me drink another I need to stay

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:47.320
awake let me drink another and not putting any thought at all into what is this going to do to

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:53.000
my kidneys take a break my liver can't process this much taurine when you're when you're playing

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.280
games or you know doing anything like that take a break why do you think we take a break here at

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.960
OLR instead of doing three hours because people's gotta pee take a little break to you know drink

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:08.560
water and use the restroom and all that stuff so all right anyhow let us take a break on over to

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.360
our Facebook and Google Plus communities because when you slam those words together you get FUGL

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:21.240
Plus but we just call it FUGL for short in a segment we call the FUGL question of the week

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:35.640
heading on over to our communities we're gonna get some responses to this question tonight we

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.840
are sure that many of you have heard the news this week that Igarashi left Konami after many

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:43.840
years of working on the Castlevania series so we thought we'd use this as an excuse to ask our

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.400
audience about their thoughts on Castlevania the past and the present do you have a favorite game

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.800
in the series do you still play the new games or could you never get into the series and why

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.800
so we're gonna get people's thoughts on Castlevania tonight so let's start with over on

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.480
Facebook wicked from the nerdgasm Network who says the Castlevania series is a very personal

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.760
favorite of mine I originally cut my gaming teeth playing countless hours of Castlevania 2 just

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.680
trying to decipher what the hell the villagers were telling me I never did beat the game until

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.760
I was into my 20s though sorry guys I suddenly decided to get a case of the hiccups my favorite

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.960
game in the series fluctuates a lot especially after all of my game challenges over the past 18

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.640
months right now it's Aria of sorrow followed up by Symphony of the night sandwiched by dawn of

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.800
sorrow in third I fell in love with the Metroidvania style of Symphony growing up and I feel the sorrow

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.720
pair took the spirit of the game and ran with it I like the classic style side scrollers especially

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:42.240
Rondo of blood and super Castlevania 4 but I never could get into the 3d ones sour taste to

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.100
my mouth from Castlevania 64 I guess then I know a while back I think he went through and played

01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:51.740
like every single stinking Castlevania game because they they do these like little challenges

01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:56.980
on their show where they play every game in a series it's pretty impressive let's see dark

01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:01.380
Tetsuya says favorite game in the series has got to be Symphony of the night games like that helped

01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:08.420
inspire my favorite indie title ever wink what could that be as for egos future well if he follows

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:12.940
in the footsteps of KJ and ifune I'm very excited about the prospect of a similar game with his

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:19.540
influence yeah I'm sure that's just a matter of time our pal Jeremy from Koopa Club says I love

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:24.700
this series my faves are the original games the more action-oriented ones I like the Metroid style

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.740
games as well but those don't appeal to me as much as say super Castlevania 4 does the first

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:34.220
Lords of Shadow isn't all that bad but it's not really that great either I haven't played the

01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:38.260
other two games in the series and maybe I will someday but right now I have no desire to really

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:44.940
reward Konami with any of my time oh snap I also don't see why anyone is sad that Ega left chances

01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.860
are he'd never have made another Castlevania game anyway given that they had him working on social

01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.620
games for the past few years and I'm adding into that and canceling them let him leave and make

01:50:54.620 --> 01:51:00.420
something better I can agree with that Ian also from Koopa Club that's Koopa with a Q Club with

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:07.060
the K another great podcast says I remember liking Castlevania 64 a bunch and really got into the DS

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:11.740
games I'm not sad about him leaving either as that appears to be the trend that people are doing

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:15.940
I'm hoping the Silent Hill masterminds follow suit and we will get kickstarters out the ass

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:22.740
and vag for their respected games what do you think dark Sakura how about kickstarters out the ass and

01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:33.780
vag don't know no no no no no no no no no no no no no SSJ 100 Matt giving us our favorite kind of

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:41.340
answer a haiku here we go are you ready for the haiku whipping vampires never get that's all you

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:48.540
already lost whipping vampire oh no I just kidding I can't count just kidding that whipping vampires

when it is Simon's quest that is a lie Simon's quest is one of my favorites don't spread lies

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:22.060
on my show our friend Shane says Castlevania 3 only because it had a pirate named Grant

01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:27.460
de nasty cracks me up every time I read it was that a mistranslation thing or is that really

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:34.620
was grant de nasty grant de nasty according to the website how many syllables calm vampire is two

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:42.060
syllables but what about vampires that would use syllables will be two syllables thought I'd try

01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:51.220
unless you're from Texas or Alabama or somewhere vampires then it's got 50 all right and lastly

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:56.980
nemesis 47 on Facebook nemesis 47 says Castlevania Symphony the night on the old PlayStation one

01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:01.620
still to this day one of my favorite games in the series I still remember the time I beat it and got

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:07.340
the good ending by exploring every nook and cranny in the castle remember getting that stinking

01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:11.300
upside-down castle the first time in one of the top 10 moments in gaming ever when you unlock

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:16.780
that upside-down castle and you're like ah fuck no it's after you get through with with butthole

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:24.660
shaft which is what I called him related to the acid badge Kickstarter no no no butthole shaft

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:36.080
was yes the dark priest shaft I'm just talking about shaft shut your mouth um I still what I

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:40.740
always wanted to do that was I was trying to find because you know there was the hidden track for

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:47.500
Maria having been turned into or possessed by the succubus hmm but I never did find that in the

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:54.900
Japanese one which Dan imported before he and I got together wow that's actually pretty impressive

01:53:54.900 --> 01:54:02.140
yeah all right let's see going to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there act

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:07.140
deaf says super Castlevania 4 is definitely my favorite in the series that was a good one I love

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:11.580
that one on Super Nintendo and then there was Castlevania 5 on the Super Nintendo and I remember

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:16.220
thinking at the time this game is ass and it wasn't until much later I learned about how it's

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:23.140
because Castlevania 5 was it was um why can't the name slips me not symphony night but the one before

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:29.500
it Rondo blood blood oh blood crammed into a Super Nintendo cartridge and it wasn't Castlevania 5

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:34.580
it was actually listed as Dracula X Oh was it I thought they called it five here they it was

01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:39.460
Dracula I think it made might have like given it a subtitle is Super Castlevania 5 yeah cuz Super

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:48.180
Castlevania 4 was the redo of the first one but it wasn't really a redo sort of it was first style

01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:56.380
yeah but um but yeah Dracula X was in fact I've got the box and manual and everything but nothing

01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:01.260
is as awesome as playing the damn game on the PC Engine because oh my god I remember you brought

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:08.220
fucking epic you brought that over to our we listen to the beginning in gothic German with

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:13.900
the when the girl gets stabbed oh god that game is awesome and oh my god playing through the game

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:19.780
is fucking Maria singing the entire time okay she gets a special attack wouldn't you get the the

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:24.780
him where I think what Richard does is throw it at people or some shit like that she starts singing

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.420
and her singing is so bad it kill things are you finished no that games fucking awesome alright

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:35.940
lastly Jason over on Google Plus says I tried playing Lords of Shadow the first one and I

01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:40.380
wasn't pleased I made it through four distinct levels before giving up at the shadow of Colossus

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:45.620
ripoff lol I love Castlevania I've always loved Castlevania I got a late start on the series and

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:49.880
played Symphony of the Night before I even played the Nintendo and Super Nintendo versions but I

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.500
enjoyed them all I enjoyed practically every 2d Castlevania and have fond memories of Castlevania

01:55:54.500 --> 01:56:02.060
64 what but any more modern 3d Castlevania than that just hasn't attracted me that is some by the

01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:05.660
way I wasn't able to read them all tonight because we had a lot of long answers but please check out

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:10.540
all of our answers at our Facebook community facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and also

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:16.900
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio for the other answers over there thanks to everybody

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:23.020
that answered the question this week what a shit once and for all in chat what's that how many

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:30.580
syllables vampire has oh no remember Castlevania judgment um don't know no I don't it never

01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:37.500
existed it never existed in my universe la la la la that was the beginning of the end you know what

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:42.420
you know what you know what we need to just like just completely play through Rondo blood at my

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:50.380
house break out the the turbo duo get some Rondo on it would be nice if we finally got one of these

01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:54.460
gaming marathons I've been talking about doing for five years off the ground and they're right

01:56:54.460 --> 01:57:01.060
all right let's move on we got more news to get to and your calls and emails pretty soon here but

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:07.100
starting off with Loki so the oh yeah has done a lot of weird made a lot of weird decisions lately

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:14.580
in making itself irrelevant but now they're doing I guess I want to call this almost like the final

01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:19.740
nail in the coffin but they're now dropping the free to try requirement for developers because you

01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:25.220
may remember when the OUYA came out all the games around the OUYA had a free component to them so

01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:29.260
you can at least try them out now that's not required so now basically it's the Android

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:36.420
marketplace on a really shitty console that now you can also play those games on other things

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:43.180
including maybe soon PC so what's the point again tell me do you regret your decision to back that

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:49.260
Kickstarter ah yes I do but at least I got to try the console out for a while and I mean I made

01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:56.860
most of my money back so hey ladies again extended rental it was a it was a rental it was a red box

01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:01.380
but a silver box yeah it's like when I used to rent consoles and I got to try it too so it worked

01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:12.660
out yeah so I got to laugh at it but yeah I don't know why they would do that but whatever um also

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:20.220
apparently Disney interactive they are scaling back and that story was left over from last week

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:26.460
oh I'm sorry how was my bad on the Cheryl tonight sorry fired I knew there'd be a mistake I knew we

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:30.700
would come to the new studio and there'd be some damn mistake well this it was just that not worse

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:37.860
the best part is we can edit that out we do it live here at all our fuck it we'll do it live

01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:42.180
well I just want to reiterate from last week that Disney interactive is making less games

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:50.300
because you know what they made like what one game last year you know one console game Disney

01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:55.900
infinity oh I'm sorry two games there's planes to like everybody else social so social is huge

01:58:55.900 --> 01:59:00.220
on social yeah and so you know what's gonna happen now there's not gonna be planes this year so fuck

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:03.980
you people that like planes you're only getting get Disney infinity too if that ever comes out

01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:10.940
which it probably will because it made a lot of money all right anyway moving on to more recent

01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:18.900
news and things that are upcoming to the PlayStation 4 apparently pre-loading is supposed

01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:23.140
to be a thing that's coming to the PlayStation 4 I thought this was something that was already

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:29.380
available on games but I guess not sucker punch which of course is the studio behind infamous

01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:34.980
second son said on Twitter that this is a feature that's coming later in the spring there was a

01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:39.940
tweet that said quote no preload until April this of course a response to all the people that wanted

01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:43.660
to play infamous second son which I know none of us were able to talk about during our gaming

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.140
weeks none of us have played it I know my buddy Shane's been playing it a lot he really likes

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:51.220
it a lot he says he said it reminds him of crackdown it looks like it looks good I need to

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.420
try that I never really got into the other games but no no I it's making it sound really good so

01:59:56.420 --> 02:00:00.780
I have to check that out but anyway yeah sucker punch said that in the tweet no preload until

02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:06.560
April so this could mean that future games will be something you can digitally download and then

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:09.920
play on the launch day I don't know what big games are coming out in April I know there's

02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:14.440
Final Fantasy 14 but that's a little different being an MMO so yeah I don't know I don't know

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:20.480
but that'll be cool that people can download the games and then play them at midnight on the launch

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:30.800
day as a lot of people will be doing with Diablo 3 this week I'm sure dark soccer so this is just

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:39.040
I really had to bring this article up just because of something that Bioware Montreal's game designer

02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:46.280
Munvir Hare was bringing about he actually did a talk at game developers conference called

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:53.200
misogyny racism and homophobia where do video games stand basically challenging this whole we

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:59.560
only develop male characters because only guys or the majority of our market are guys he said

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:06.040
and this is a from here that it's cynical to assume that an audience isn't capable of embracing

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:13.680
a gay character in any way and that more exclusive female protagonists that aren't glorified sex

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.640
objects and have personalities beyond supporting the men in the game that it's a good thing I mean

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:26.600
basically is bringing up you know the female Shepherd who you know there's a yeah okay well

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.400
is it 15% of the players had a female Shepherd but still you got a lot more I think attention

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:39.560
with her in the third Mass Effect which was about the best thing about the game and I mean they're

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:45.640
basically saying you know the people are arguing that women weren't soldiers in medieval times but

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:52.600
there actually is plenty of historical evidence that women were would fight and that in other

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:58.300
cultures outside of our typical Eurocentric video game you know focus that there were plenty of

02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:04.440
female warriors in other cultures so it was really really good you know but the best thing that I

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.720
think came out of this that he's quoted saying is let's not be scared to ruffle feathers and let's

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:14.000
be open and honest about our intentions let's push and engage in a new discourse as a result

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.920
of these dynamics and let's do all of this because we are current what we are currently doing is

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:26.400
absolutely not working it's about damn time I'm trying to see if some of our chatters have some

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.480
comments on this Seattle in our chat room says everybody loves Samus not counting other M hey

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.520
you know there's some people that like other M as well you know well I think that it's it's I mean

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:44.240
but but I mean he's right it's sad that it needs to be said it's not like females aren't accepted

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:51.920
as huge big important video game characters like you have you know Samus like you have Lara Croft

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:57.160
like you have I mean heck Princess Peach in a way you know is well I mean you know people were

02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:01.840
excited to be able to play as her I know that might be a bit of a stretch but femshep and you

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.760
know so on well and I'm not I'm not like saying it's perfect by any means but I'm just saying

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:12.280
that like you know it's not like they can't there shouldn't be that fear to have the female lead

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.320
because there's plenty of very successful ones well and it's not just the female lead it's having

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:30.400
other sexual not just sexualities but having a gender sexuality of race you know even religion

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.920
I mean we finally have had a few Muslim characters pop up here and there we need more I think you

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:42.160
know I'm gonna say Co C's characters of color you know we need more people and we need to actually

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:49.560
have where I like being able to make have your character and make the choice but I like having

02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:55.480
other characters that interact with it also have you know not just oh we're gonna do whatever

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.480
because you're the main character but I'd like to see other characters that are strictly like like

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:05.640
I hate to go back to Mass Effect 3 on this one but how are you had trainer or you had Steve you

02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:11.760
know they were very firmly in their sexuality you know yet you had plenty of other characters

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:18.160
who didn't matter you know but my point is is that it needs to be recognized that you have people

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.800
coming from all sorts of walks and you know I really hate using the word preference because

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.160
it's something that's you're born with something that's ingrained and preference to me denotes a

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:35.840
choice you know so I've had a lot of people say identity yeah well but I look at identity

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:43.400
as yourself and not necessarily what you know organs you like to play with if that makes sense

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:51.960
well I like the church organ well you know what I hate organs so you'd like to play the piano

02:04:52.960 --> 02:05:10.280
exactly anyway anyway now I'm a flautist cuz I flout it uh-huh but let's say they release I

02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:18.360
don't know Halo 5 with a gay master or you know gay master chief or whatever like good I mean

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:22.520
this is what I would say no there's gonna be a lot of people out there that are gonna have

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:26.960
something to say it's not that I don't I don't hear me wrong on this I mean I would love something

02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.720
like that but I also am a realist where there's a lot of people that would be like you know here

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:36.320
would be my problem with Master Chief as in the character that has existed through these games

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:43.560
there's a cannon established and I'm really fine with keeping a character cannon if say that there

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:50.320
was a much future Halo game much you know later on in the future and it's a new Master Chief and

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:57.280
he happened to light the cock fine I don't care that'd be great I don't really think people need

02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:04.880
to be judged by you know what bits they like poking in their bits I don't think it should

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:11.160
matter and it's no one's fucking business yeah it really is no one's fucking business and I hate the

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:17.640
whole concept of closets and in and out of closets because who the fuck cares I don't care what parts

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:22.640
people like to play with well unfortunately there's too many people out there that do in

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:33.160
this people suck but my whole point is that I don't care if this X person has a wife or if she's got a

02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.680
girlfriend on the side or if it's a big open marriage and there's a bunch of fucking going

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:42.040
on under what I don't give a shit don't give a shit and I would like to see more characters

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:46.320
or stuff like that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what their sexuality is it doesn't matter

02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:52.240
who they fuck I'd like to see a whole lot of fucking going on to you would you for no but I

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.560
think it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter it should matter what their skin color is what

02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:02.920
matters is that yes this creates who this person is we respect that these are the things that make

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:10.000
this person who they are but it should just be a oh okay that's cool that's who you are I don't

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.960
need I don't care you know if you know what I mean not that it's not a doesn't matter kind of thing

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:21.200
but that it's a that's who they are I respect it let's keep moving all right I'm going to some first

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:26.840
a question from our chat room from our buddy Shana Lenko Jamie would you consider male Shep being

02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:32.720
straight cannon since until Mass Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean

02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:39.400
they fundamentally changed me I to tell Jason I didn't say what bits with their bits I said what

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:45.320
bits in their bits oh because some people like it in the ass and some people like it in the badge

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:52.640
okay some people like it in other things I don't care because you all right but what about Shane's

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:59.920
question god damn it would you consider male Shep being being straight cannon since until Mass

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:03.960
Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean they fundamentally changed him

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:11.520
that's kind of an interesting one because I think that they realized that it shouldn't have been a

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:17.920
thing to begin with technically your Shep doesn't have to have sex at all or doesn't have to have

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:23.280
your set you can have can be asexual I could totally have an asexual Shepherd except Garris

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:29.200
but you know what I mean if you if Rex was available I'd totally go for that if you could

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.480
resist Garris's temptations you could have a completely asexual Shepherd I tried once Rob I

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:40.560
really did try and I tried to play a bro Shep so I could get Caden uh-huh and I couldn't play him

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:48.280
because no all right going to s to 100 Matt because I like this day I like what see I'll just said

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:53.600
put my bits in your bites as she went under Matt says progress takes time it took a long time for

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.000
there to be female protagonists and film movies books etc video games with the in-depth storylines

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.160
are somewhat of a new media but what does what does bother me is that given how much we've

02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:08.760
progressed as a society that it would be quicker but again progress takes time and I actually kind

02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:13.560
of agree with us Joe and under Matt I think I think we'll get there and I I still I think the

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.960
only way we're going to get there is if we keep hooping and hollering and talking about it and

02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:23.760
having this dialogue that's how we're going to get there but I just wish it wasn't necessary I have

02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:29.040
faith that we will get there I mean but look at look at what the indie gaming scene is already I

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:34.080
mean you have things like gone home you have you say was here pitching Dominique Pamplemousse which

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:40.000
you know to tackle some very some issues you you don't really see in games otherwise you know and

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:48.880
so on so it's starting in the indie scene for the record by the way to add another thing to what

02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:56.160
Shane asked in my own headcanon as far as I could get away with playing a broshep he was totally

02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:03.600
whacking off to Caden it's a picture totally whacking it because honestly I like the Caden

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.520
romance with a broshep a lot more than I do with a female Shepherd Tiger Claw in chat says what

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:16.440
would Shepherd be like if he or she was transgender the same be Shepherd Shepherd with bits that don't

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.760
quite fit of course in the future hopefully they would have much better corrective surgery for that

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:28.640
I I'm wondering if maybe Tiger Claw means there could be a because you know how some folks prefer

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:36.000
to use gender-neutral language like neither he nor she you you they or Z you know a different term

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.880
but that's not really possible in Mass Effect but I think I think we also have to look at you know

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:46.560
like say on Facebook there's what 50 different ways you can identify your gender it might be a

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.000
bit much for a video game to have 50 different branching options I mean you know yeah you do

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.720
have to kind of and not that I'm saying that we shouldn't you know have transgender representation

02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:02.080
I absolutely think that would be a great thing but as the designer does kind of have to choose

02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:07.320
at some point you know what are the possible branches for these characters and I think down

02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:12.440
the line we're definitely especially as technology catches up but for the most part and this is

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:17.760
another sad thing too I think that while the developers were trying really trying to be more

02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:24.720
open and basically throw more of a bone to you know I really think trying to push some limits

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:31.400
they're trying to be a lot more respectful of people in their lives we still have a very binary

02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:38.560
viewpoint when it comes to gender you know just in general it's hard to change you know having

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:44.200
centuries of that beaten into your culture and then have it turn around it's still pretty you

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:50.920
know instinctive to say he or she instead of realize that that what you see may not be what

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:59.800
you get so it's another thing that just has to be tackled but I'm saying that for now it's to be

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:06.160
expected but I don't think it should be expected much later on if that makes sense sure all right

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.920
well I'm sure there's plenty more comments on this but I would have to direct those to our email bag

02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:14.480
which is participate at orange laundry calm if you'd like to participate further in the discussion

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.320
but in the meantime in the interest of time we're going to tackle some other news stories so going

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:25.520
over to Loki all right so this is kind of interesting kind of all part of the I guess

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:33.240
evolution to the steam service but they're adding a virtual reality mode to I guess the latest steam

02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:41.680
beta and what that's gonna do originally you would have to add a command line dash VR to enable it

02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:46.600
but now they actually have a button for it and it's I guess meant for head mounted displays like

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:52.760
the oculus rift and so it has an ear face I think is from what I hear is similar to like the big

02:12:52.800 --> 02:13:00.440
picture mode but you know it's meant for VR displays so it's interesting I don't know I

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.600
guess obviously it's something they're gonna need you know if they're gonna be you know forward

02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:14.840
thinking so be kind of curious to see what that looks like I don't know hmm well I guess this is

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:21.000
just in time for this headset craze that's growing right yeah well if I remember correctly I think

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:27.240
the valve was kind of working with you know oculus maybe a little bit and you know just some of their

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:33.320
ideas with I remember I read a comment about like they're saying increasing like the frame rate or

02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:40.280
something or doing something with the it was some sort of different method for displaying pixels

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:48.120
that allowed you to get a lot less motion blur and basically involve them displaying an image

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:53.680
and then flashing to black almost so that you don't have that kind of streaking effect with

02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:57.960
you know pixels being left on the screen or something of course I'm just talking out of my

02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.600
ass right now but that I remember reading but Bobby says that there in in chat he's saying

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:09.800
that all these news sites that are running this story are getting it from a reddit post and so he

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:22.080
actually links us to the reddit post how funny it's his own it's his own post so Bobby Bobby's

02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:29.880
the one that posted this to read it and yeah I said FYI steam beta now has a VR mode in view

02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:35.160
menu no command-line argument needed how fight good job Bobby why didn't you break that news

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.800
over a vog network like oh I'd you have to give that one to read it it's fine it's funny though

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:46.320
but they didn't source them and they never source read it but my god now half of half of what

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:52.840
Facebook has on it like comes from like BuzzFeed they owe read it a lot of money let's be real it's

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.640
ridiculous what sites run I mean shit sometimes they run stories based on like random people's

02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:04.720
Twitter posts I just don't understand it sometimes that's hilarious yeah well let me let me read the

02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:10.480
rest of what Bobby submitted to the or the reddit here which he submitted oculus is reddit it's

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:14.760
still just big picture mode on a curved screen but it works pretty well for what it is when I

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.280
first tried it it required me to do some monitor trickery with the rift on an extended monitor and

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.840
it was very flaky now it works with my normal setup and works immediately for those that never

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.560
tried it you'll need to opt into the steam client beta and have steam VR installed from tools I'm

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.960
also opted into the beta branch of steam VR but I'm not positive if that's required for the new

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:41.880
version or not so hmm good job body he's going viral and not even he says is it says the logo

02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:45.440
is that's true you do have the little vog logo next to your submission there that's pretty cool

02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:51.200
all right well moving on to some other news this this I am NOT getting from reddit but directly

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:58.320
from the website of the creators of the game this kind of goes back to one of those the dangers of

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:04.800
kickstarters stories again the game was called super action squad that at one point was super

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:11.080
retro squad and coming from the website here exploding rabbit.com it says quote super action

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.160
squad is too big of a project for us to handle right now so we're putting it on hold to make

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:22.280
some smaller games first we will resume development on SAS or sass once we are in a better position to

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:27.200
make it the reasons for this decision including why the original Kickstarter was a bad idea in

02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.760
the first place are explained in detail below not going to read the entire post but I'll read some

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:38.480
of the bullet points here it boiled down to inexperience lack of understanding and scope

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.320
unrealistic estimate of cost being part of an ineffective team which I thought was a pretty

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:51.320
ballsy thing to write about unity is not a good tool for 2d platformers which I don't know if I

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:54.480
agree with that I don't yeah I don't either because it's kind of one of those things where

02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:59.440
it's like well you shouldn't have kickstarted a game that you didn't know that you should have

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.440
tested the system first I don't know if I buy that either well here's the thing it's like I think a

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:10.560
lot of it his main excuse was like he's used to programming in flash and then going to unity was

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.920
completely different but I think aside from creating the engine I wouldn't think it would

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:22.160
be that difficult to be able to port everything else so obviously it is I mean just because you

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:29.040
I don't know they had but yeah I mean going from taking you know creating was it Super Mario

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.800
crossover and just basically grabbing pre-made levels and pre-made assets and all that stuff to

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:40.040
creating your own stuff which let's be honest it's just kind of slight changes to the sprites of you

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:45.440
know Super Mario crossover it's Super Mario crossover retail version minus all the Mario

02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:51.960
and Nintendo stuff because we'll get sued well there's also a section in the post called what

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:57.440
do differently and I think this is interesting just a little quote from this section quote the

02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.040
thing is though knowing what I know now I would have never launched a Kickstarter for the game

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:06.960
as my first project it makes little sense for a team with little to no experience that has never

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.920
worked together to try and make a big game it would be much better to focus on something small

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:16.680
and simple after getting experience releasing small projects we would be able to work our way

02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:22.560
up to bigger ones so they you know and no real word on what's gonna happen all those people that

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.960
gave money although they are saying you know they kind of say a little bit vaguely in the post you

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:32.880
know if you were a big donator contact us we'll work something out we're not unreasonable but

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:36.200
they're talking about they can't really do refunds right now probably because the money's already

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:41.560
been spent you know people in the Kickstarter comments are pretty bad yeah I will of course

02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:46.480
but this is this is part of the dangers of Kickstarter this is why I've always been very

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.760
nervous to get in on that craze and there's still really only a hand for you to think

02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:56.880
him I can probably count on one hand the number of projects I've given to so all right anyway I

02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:02.440
could probably also count on one hand the number of emails we received this week but that's okay

02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.880
we love hearing from our listeners even when it's only a couple of them I know when they're

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:11.840
wrong you can you cannot you oh you can email us anytime you like participate at orange lounge

02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:19.520
radio.com oh what's coming up tonight our saga nothing all right hello LR I've listened to the

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:23.880
to the shortened episode this weekend I must say I appreciate you guys taking the time to record

02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.200
something during your busy schedule I very much enjoyed listening to it and I think it's great

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:33.280
that snake was mentioned as it truly is a classic game I also very much appreciate you guys

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:39.080
mentioning snake 360 and it's still in development as you read this sequel however there was a yyr

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:43.840
however there was one big inaccuracy in what was said during the episode that simply cannot let

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:48.280
pass Oh cinnamon toast crust cereal is a hundred percent naturally flavored and does not contain

02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:54.760
any fake cinnamon yes big red gum and other things containing fake cinnamon aren't the truly gross

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:59.000
gum in general is gross anyway but but only a hundred percent cinnamon and sugar present every

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.880
bite along with 15 essential vitamins and minerals it's true that some people who shower name

02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:10.840
mainly seen as me are fully entitled to their incorrect to keep the fuck but let it be placed

02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:14.960
on record that cinnamon toast crunch cereal is officially yummy and delicious keeping it real

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:20.560
yyr and you know what I still think it tastes like balls so I agree with the statement until

02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:24.240
you put it in milk and then it just kind of dissolves and it just because yeah I think

02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:28.200
it's the in milk part that really just made it very much with cinnamon and milk I mean it's

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:32.960
here's what I do a cinnamon toast I don't eat any cereal with milk I'm weird I I have one cup

02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:38.740
like a giant cup we're talking like 40 ounce cup full of cinnamon toast crunch a second cup with

02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:44.280
milk you just eat them separate it's still good but it's a way better than if it was soaking in

02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:49.720
milk yyr I would you know I don't do this very often on the show but I would like to apologize

02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:55.920
for dark soccer's behavior unless I would like you to sit and spin and golden grams golden

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:04.160
shit it is shit it is not shit it is the shit I I will I will not allow the woman to comment

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:10.720
on breakfast cereal again you know what okay but mind you mind you what did I say my favorite

02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:16.600
breakfast cereals were as a child you liked great great night like weird total and crackling oat

02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:22.960
bran but at least you pooped regularly I did poop regularly okay granted okay there were two kids

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:30.520
we know she's not full of shit see okay and by the way there were two shut up oh my god

02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:40.600
yeah Rob but there were two kids cereals that I did like one was Apple Jack's which tasted

02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:45.920
nothing like fucking apples Apple Jack's is kind of dumb I don't like it oh god you're a horrible

02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:50.480
person who would eat like kicks I never understood that it's like eating packing peanuts I mean it's

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:55.680
seriously gross kicks is gross but what I'll agree with you there honeycomb fuck that shit

02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:02.480
all right the other one was I really liked Rice Krispies I felt when they made Rice Krispies

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:08.920
treats a cereal okay but I would have to eat my Rice Krispies like super fast because I hated

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:15.800
that soggy shit at the bottom oh my god why are we talking about fucking sir I'm hungry now thanks

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:22.440
Rob I'm hungry you know what I saw at the store I couldn't free pizza today and it was great we

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:26.320
bought $200 worth of groceries today to stock our new house I saw you had food in your fridge for

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:31.360
change right and one of the one of the things we were looking at getting was you know Ritz crackers

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:37.560
or one of my favorite snacks right do you know they have bacon flavored Ritz cracker what it's

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:45.360
probably not very good you know what I found huh when I was at a total wine looking for I was going

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:51.840
to go get some frivolous and they were out of frivolous the fuckers bacon wine they had bacon

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:58.080
maple donut beer that sounds amazing I was like the fuck is this no so I bought sticky toffee

02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:10.320
beer instead next email oh my god so it's very short it's from someone named Travis which I'm

02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:14.240

is ruining my life and it needs to stop and I also want to give a second F you to dark Sakura hey I

02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:34.240
didn't give you a sinus infection but you made them popular you know what the jazzling is popular

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:43.160
are you getting it done are you getting pea-jazzled you know I know about getting ass-jazzled but I

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:48.600
guess not well we'll talk to Exeter for about you know ass bleaching and stuff like that but it'd

02:28:48.600 --> 02:29:02.400
be like be jazzled you don't say and this is your first time listening to orange does radio I'm

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:07.960
fucking sorry I'm sorry that you've had to put up with this shit it is so good for Loki to be back

02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:14.480
in the studio I feel like this is I mean yes Skype works but it doesn't work the same I'm just saying

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:21.400
all right anyhow getting back into some gaming news Loki so speaking about Kickstarter and how

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:31.240
it's a terrible idea to back game projects you you Suzuki is researching the idea but not yet

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:37.160
decided if he's going to kickstart Shenmue 3 which I can tell you right now if that were to

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:44.400
be put on the Kickstarter would probably be approved immediately so research a little quicker

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:51.720
but yeah so I don't know that would be kind of neat to see him put you know Shenmue 3 on there

02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:58.040
does he own the rights to that or is it still Sega I I don't know I think the license yeah I thought

02:29:58.040 --> 02:30:02.720
we had a story just a couple that yeah we just had a story a couple weeks ago the the licensing

02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:12.240
expired the trademark I don't know that so it is open season now all right moving on to one more

02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:16.760
story about a game a lot of people are looking forward to in fact if this game doesn't show up

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:23.040
at e3 this year I don't know what Nintendo's gonna do it will be cut bitches III think so but it has

02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:31.800
to do with the Wii U version version the Wii U version in order to save this system I'm gonna

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:40.680
need to sacrifice three virgins all right now the Wii U version of the Legend of Zelda and the

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:46.160
producer eg Anuma has made some interesting comments about the Wii U version of the Legend

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:53.000
of Zelda and that could be that there may be a top-down view in these future Zelda games because

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.680
you know top-down was the way the old Zelda game with at least the very first Zelda game was then

02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:02.240
of course linked to the past and you know link between worlds is kind of brought that back a

02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:08.920
little bit but we haven't I mean the console ones involved in 3d ever since you know ocarina so could

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:14.800
the top-down view return and let's see the official Nintendo magazine had an interview and the

02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:19.120
question the interviewer asked what did you learn from making this game can you use any of these

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:24.400
ideas in future titles for example the merge with walls ability and is amazing and it would be a

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:29.600
shame if it was never used again and he says I think the top-down view made the ability to enter

02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:34.560
the wall really interesting also in this game I feel we found a new direction in regards to the

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:39.600
potential use of the good old top-down view for Zelda it's the kind of point we will take in good

02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:44.400
consideration when thinking about the next Zelda game I think people might be reading into that

02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:49.440
quote a little too much but when you consider that there's a second screen I could definitely

02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:54.880
see some sort of like maybe like top-down map view in addition to what you're seeing on the screen I

02:31:54.880 --> 02:32:00.640
think would be a very logical extension or dungeon maps certainly on your or your Wii U screen I

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:07.160
think there's certainly potential for top-down things to come into that that map or in the the

02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:16.120
second screen if nothing else so all right my game guru and Chad at live dot vog network

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:22.360
dot-com says oh god they're making a new four swords game aren't they hey you never know you

02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:27.120
never know what you're pretty popular though weren't they yeah yeah I think so they're giving

02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:31.760
it away for free on 3ds for a little bit twice oh my god I know we had another unicorn in chat

02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:37.920
mmm Zuck is actually in chat he's in chat good times live that you should be in chat to live

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:42.320
dot vog network yeah everyone why aren't you there all right because they're listening during the

02:33:07.880 --> 02:33:12.920
while we wait for some calls to come in I don't know if Loki has any last-minute stories but I

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:20.080
can also go to our Twitter as well at twitter.com slash olr Loki not really much there's a rumor

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:25.800
that Rainbow Six Patriots isn't redesigned from the ground up three times so that doesn't mean

02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:33.720
it's coming out anytime soon that I don't really have it's slow slow news week which is weird

02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:37.560
because game developers conference was this week but then again that means that's that's because

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:43.320
you know again it's not a news conference so nobody's developing right now cuz they're all

02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:48.800
at the conference not all of them I know seriously like one of the shows I watch cooking with unity

02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:54.320
they've been off this week because he's at gay only I was about to like where are you guys you'd

02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:57.320

02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:04.920
launch radio who's this it is jammer Jay you guys hear me yeah hey jammer Jay what's up but nothing

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:09.800
nothing much I just actually I'm listening to the song I'm the show live it's been quite a

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:17.800
while listening to it live well welcome back thanks for being here hello well the darks occur

02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:22.320
it's like what you want to share with our listeners tonight do you have a question or a statement or

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:28.040
what oh yeah it was like so here's a question I've been going over it cuz this happened to me

02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:33.160
the other week so what happens when your backlog like you have something that's on your backlog

02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:39.880
like basically I had like Final Fantasy x2 it was all my backlog for these two so long that they

02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:46.320
didn't HD they did each HD remake I still haven't got to it but it's been like 14 years so when you

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:51.400
have all these games in your backlog does it just become like a collection or a vault it's like yeah

02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:58.840
hi yeah I I have had games and I hate to admit this cuz I'm so gonna get judged for it I have

02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:06.000
games that I bought the day they came out and they're still sealed because that's how bad my

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.760
gamer a DD is okay so that's what it takes I have the same thing too it's like I have games still

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:16.080
shrink wrapped and they're like from previous like there's stuff on ps2 that I think I would

02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:22.280
get to one day but that one day hasn't happened like in ten years it's like wow yeah no you're

02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:26.440
not alone I can tell you that I do it too I don't know if any of our chatters want to admit to that

02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:31.080
as well over at live that vog network calm but dark soccer you're the most ultimate collector

02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.120
of them all do you have games that you like you played once or like you've like never even played

02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:41.960
but you just like hey I gotta have this remember the games I have that are still in shrink wrap so

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:48.680
yes yes do you remember any up top of your head um I don't think I've opened my copy of death

02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:58.720
smiles and I have the special edition um feel my Saturn RPGs a couple PlayStation games I don't

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.600
actually I think that one of my copies of Space Channel five part two is still shrink wrapped

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:11.360
because I had the Japanese one and I haven't played my copy of Bayonetta yet so you're not

02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:18.680
alone jammer Jay there's plenty of us that have the same problem now let me ask you this are you

02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:23.600
gonna finally check out tend to and are you gonna check out your original PlayStation 2 version or

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:29.960
if you just said I forget it at this point I'll just play the the new HD remake I I think I'm

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.960
just gonna play the new HD remake because my actual x2 is like the international version but

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:40.640
I never got past the intro to see if the rest of the game was in English or not I think I do have

02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:54.200
another x2 copy of 10 to Jamie bonkers over here it's not to give up too much information I am one

02:36:54.200 --> 02:37:00.440
of dark sikora's now I'm one of her co-workers in the land of cubicles so land of cubes low cat in

02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:09.920
the house yeah okay does it drive you then crazy when people say I asked I don't think if I could

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:14.760
I I hear people say it but that's not what it is and people drive me crazy when they do anything

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:21.520
X when it's supposed to be 10 I've gotten like and I blame Bobby for this now actually because

02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:29.400
of this whole gif thing but I still call it gif because I can pronounce things properly yes but

02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:35.640
now I hit stun says Mega Man x2 was a great game that one actually is an X because that's a legit

02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:41.480
X yeah because it's a prototype yeah but like what gets nevermind I'm just not gonna say anything

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:46.840
else you almost had her going all right the jammer Jay is there anything else you want to share

02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:53.280
with others tonight so now at this point it has become a collection I guess the backlog if it goes

02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:59.280
back more than 10 years like that if it goes back more than 10 years you know if it's still shrink

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:03.840
wrapped you could consider selling it on eBay depending how common or uncommon it is otherwise

02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:12.000
you know what hold on to it as a memory to quit wasting your freaking money I know there's like

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.160
some like C titles that I have like in the backlog doll I think like Dark Sector for 360 I think Loki

02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:22.200
might have planned it I don't know no one else has ever heard of it I have a copy for some reason

02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:26.920
haven't I haven't played it but I actually still have tchotchkes from like a few years ago from it

02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:32.280

02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.360
show's going on the harder time I'm having with my voice so I may have to call it a little a little

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.040
earlier tonight but we'll see here moving on let's go to another call because it is lighting up here

02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:51.880
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yeah this is raging leader no if it isn't our newest

02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:59.840
intern intern rage inator how you liking the new joke book loving it what's up buddy uh just two

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:05.520
questions but I'm willing to bet that the answers are gonna be kind of long-winded if my guess is

02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:15.840
right um you know the first one have you ever been have you ever known you know people not to

02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:25.680
basically we're like a better work petition three companies to get certain games onto steam and be

02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:35.840
successful about it oh to get a game on steam and be successful about it um not not like green light

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:43.160
word you know where copies is basically say hey we're thinking about bring this game I would you

02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:50.960
buy it whereas we we the consumer folks down well I think are you're talking probably about like

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:54.680
these Sega games they have a bunch of positions going on try to get a bunch of different Sega

02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:02.320
games ported the PC and I think on steam but I think for most companies nowadays that aside

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:09.200
from EA but they probably want their game on steam and so it's not really an issue of oh I have to

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:16.320
convince you to put your already you know available PC game on steam usually they want to be on steam

02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:22.680
with the exceptions of you know some of them are there on EA's origin service or you know like in

02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.560
the case of like Mojang and stuff that has you know he's doing well enough by himself he doesn't

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:34.520
need steam oh all right yeah you know the reason I bring it up is because I was commenting to dr.

02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:40.640
her the other day you know speech at that it's kind of a crying shame that aside from metal

02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:47.320
gelt metal slug three there's not really anything by SNK on service so I thought there was a king of

02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:53.320
fighters one of the recent king of fighters game oh oh yeah you're absolutely right you're

02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.920
absolutely right I completely forgot about that that's all right it's a big store it's easy to

02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:05.560
get lost in yeah really now as far as my second question you know it goes it's probably more

02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:14.640
geared towards a Loki because he's more of the builder expert in some group now when you were

02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:21.640
building your cabinets you know be your main campus or what have you what god you know like

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:32.120
joysticks and monitors aside what kind of materials did you use did you use like parker board or well

02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:38.760
it's mainly MDF for it I mean depends on the size you know I my first main cabinet which was

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:45.680
an ultimate arcade to cabinet it was made with three quarters at MDF it was actually supposed

02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:53.880
to have been I think 5 8 or something which made it a lot heavier than it needed to be so

02:42:53.880 --> 02:43:03.320
is is basically MDF but I mean I don't know it all depends on how you're trying to you know what

02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:07.960
you're doing with it like if you're painting it or if you're gonna you know put a laminate on it

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:15.480
or you know whatever but usually they're out of MDF or some sort of plywood just because you know

02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:22.040
MDF does tend to be a little bit weak sometimes especially if you have really heavy the other

02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:27.040
thing too is like you know if I were to go back and do it again I wouldn't have done like kind of

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:32.440
a classic arcade cabinet I would have wanted it more like you know the view Lex cabinets and stuff

02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:38.640
where it's just control panel and HDTV because honestly trying to get stuff you know running on

02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:43.440
low enough resolution though you know work with a TV or you know a monitor or something like that

02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.800
it's just a pain in the ass it's a lot easier just to have a nice HD screen because then you can do a

02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:53.680
lot more with it you can you play indie games on it or whatever and you know may not be as classic

02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.600
as you you know you have it a main cabinet but it's a hell a lot cheaper and probably a hell a

02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:04.600
lot easier to make I want to say I spent three grand on that first cabinet really wish I hadn't

02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:10.240
built it yeah honestly no I've been kind of sort of toying with the idea of building y'all a

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:18.120
candidate but it you know if I do build ones could be like big the basic shell of the cabinet they

02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:26.480
would look like basically like y'all your classic arcade candidate from the 80s or early 90s yeah

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:33.680
probably make it out so I kind of went for lemon on the sides and what that in for like a martyr I

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:43.840
would probably use like a flat screen LCD monitor or TV yeah off the shelf Bob you know fight stick

02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:51.800
and then just so I don't like I get my computer to overheat because lack of circulation ever off

02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:59.880
the side yeah no that way I can't really skip y'all play our key game especially if I were

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:04.880
played like something like Street Fighter 4 or what have you well the other thing you can do

02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:09.880
too is actually just get an old arcade cabinet and just convert that over it might even be cheaper

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:14.560
and it's already been built up nice and there's a lot of people on you know not even necessarily

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:18.640
eBay bond Craigslist they're willing to get rid of those things for like a hundred bucks or less

02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:22.480
or even you know a couple hundred dollars to pay on the condition dark soccer you guys had like a

02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:26.080
pole position machine in your house at one point it was like a converted thing like that right we

02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:30.800
did yeah we um made our yeah our main was built out of the pole position which for a while doubled

02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:36.720
as Shermie's house that's awesome an arcade cabinet is a cat house it's actually kind of

02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:41.760
because okay the stand-up one had the pedal so sure me would just walk in with where we had no

02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:48.640
pedal yeah and that was just her house it's like I live in an arcade cabinet now you go Shermie

02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:53.440
that is amazing all right and the rage inator by the way since we see him on video he's petting

02:45:53.440 --> 02:46:03.080
his kitty right now is in the background there hi Anakin all right oh he looked all right

02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:07.320
rage nader I'm gonna let you go buddy so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call

02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:13.960
yeah take care of you too bye I am actually gonna close up the Skype line I'm sorry I didn't end up

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.640
taking more calls tonight but I do kind of need to take a little break because I'm finding the

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:23.200
longer we're going on I'm like more sinus pressure that's not good I think it's time for pills so I

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:28.000
want to quickly shout out some of these tweets we got here at twitter.com slash olr by the way

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.320
if you didn't get through and you do have something to say please do email us we'd love to hear from

02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:35.120
you I mean dark soccer only had like two emails to read tonight and one of them was like a line

02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:45.440
long so give her work next week y'all participate whatever what let it go stop I'm gonna throw this

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:50.160
cell phone at you I don't even care all right just a few tweets here that I want to read a

02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:56.480
few stories that were submitted s2100 Matt sent us a tweet about the ET 2600 game landfill site

02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:02.680
dig documentary is put on hold by New Mexico authorities really oh the Popo is shutting it

02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:08.480
down I guess they didn't like the idea of people going out there digging it all up hmm I think we

02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:13.320
referenced this early in the show but Tiger Claw says this link to a story about how Nintendo has

02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:20.840
50 unity games on their way to Wii U but can they can they sell well alongside Mario I mean is the

02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.760
question absolutely can I think that I think they can too because what I buy Mario what else you're

02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:30.520
gonna buy well well but I hear the games are doing really well on Wii U too because of the fact that

02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.280
they don't get lost in the marketplace like they kind of do on the other systems so I mean there

02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:44.040
is that and lastly Tiger Claw says this is a link Microsoft saying DirectX 12 will improve Xbox one

02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:51.120
performance um that's that's not too surprising I mean you know sometimes these firmware updates

02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:55.400
and things will help the systems run better right and so when we're talking about something like

02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:00.360
DirectX which is basically you know Xbox that whole name Xbox comes from DirectX something

02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:06.080
I mean that's no surprise that should help things but wouldn't that be akin to like a graphics

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:10.840
driver update or something like it might it might make a few things better here and there but it's

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:14.840
not gonna like radically change your experience um it's actually supposed to improve frame rate

02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:22.240
is better and you know they're talking about fours of five and stuff and saying it was like 60 I

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:26.640
thought fours of five is already 60 frames per second but I guess they're talking about how you

02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:31.200
know they use it to improve fours of fives performance and stuff and how it's supposed to

02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:36.320
have a lot less overhead so you know a lot less processing power is required to do the same stuff

02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:42.360
so that will help because you know a lot of these you know Xbox one games are having trouble hitting

02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:47.520
1080p I mean it's a lot of the 720 you know upscale and they're having trouble hitting 60

02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:53.560
frames per second so anything can help and hopefully DirectX you know 12 will get you

02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:59.160
where it needs to be on par with like the PlayStation 4 all right sounds good well that

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:04.600
is going to wrap up another edition of orange lounge radio our first from the brand new studio

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:10.680

02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:22.920
thought tonight is I need to go sit in a hot steam to clear up my sinuses right now hot steam sounds

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:28.800
awesome not like steam like the video game service on PC's although you know that steam's pretty cool

02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:33.480
too but I want some old-school steam and so I think I'm gonna go get some I want the live
